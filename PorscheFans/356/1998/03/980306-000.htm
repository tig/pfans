hello DANA.....and all other 356 addicts everywhere.
glad to hear from someon from the NW.well dana your stort sounds
familiar....in 95' i also bought a 356 coupe (60' super90), it also was a barn
story,and i also restored it with the idea of taking it to the track now and
then,i hope i still have the guts to try it.anyway seeing how youre from the
northwest maybe you can help ...i'm going to lay on some major guilt trips to
anybody who doesnt attend the 356 events this summer.
i think we've got to plan early so noone has an excuse not to attend.the NW
Bullsession is in surrey BC and people from spokane are probably going to say
"thats too far ....i'm not ready.."........well its not going to work. i'm
going through a heck of alot of trouble to get my car done in time....so if
someone doesnt show up i'll just have to drive out to their house and make'em
look at it. my point is its the 50th anniversary of something great so
everybody everywhere should do their part.              even me. so Dana keep
in touch and let me know of any slackers, i'll do what i can to help someone
attend (if they need a place to stay the day before ..etc..), and i too need
all the help i can get ,i have a couple of questions i'll post later.
.
