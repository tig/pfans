Subject: 1950 Porsche

I need some  obsure parts, and contact with the guys that know truly
early cars. This is for a 1950 Coupe that I sold to a gentleman in Italy
that is doing an "Old World" style restoration. This car will be
magnificent and very important, being it was made while Ferninand was
still shuffling around the shop, August, 1950. He died in Jan. 1951.

Also does anyone know what the correct outside mirror would be?
I really wish we had Brent Johnson and Mark Turczyn on this chat line.
Are there any real experts that have been laying low out there? Please
come forward.

I've already exposed myself as no expert on the 356, but I've scanned my
meager library and turned up no exterior mirrors on 356s prior to 1955. The
earliest I saw was just the same mirror that appears on the 1955 550/1500RS
Spyder.
I do have a listing in a catalog for:
Outside rearview mirror, "Aero" 1950-61, includes seal, left or right
#RP 219C $36.83
from the good folks at TWEEKS 1800-428-2200
but I couldn't find any photograhic evidence of this or any exterior mirror on
a 1950 coupe.
The one from TWEEKS is a pretty nice looking piece. Authentic to the 1950
model year?
Good luck,
