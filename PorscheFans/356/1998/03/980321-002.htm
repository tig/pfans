>it was suggested that i post the following notice to your board.
the car is on the 912 registry....
 my husband has a "65 912 that he brought from germany in 1975.  it is
apart, he was redoing the engine, but is all there, has some extra parts,
bumpers, etc. wheels and tires are still good i believe. It is the 3 gauge
dash, it has been sitting so the interior needs replacing. he doesn't have
anywhere to work on it now and has moved to other toys.  he is asking
$5000. for the car.  if you are interested or have any questions, please
feel free to contact me. where are you located?  we are in central calif.

Sounds like it's in my price range, unfortunately I live in Michigan. It
would cost a 
fortune to get it back home. Let the guys on Porschefans know about it, I'm
sure some 
can use a 912 project.
