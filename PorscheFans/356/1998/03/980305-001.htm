Way to go Jimbo! Thank you!  I just subscribed a few weeks ago hoping to
meet, ask questions and learn more about the 356.  I purchased a '63
coupe in 1995 "a barn story" after two years of a total restoration and
in the meantime purchased a '55 speedster (got the fever :) the little
coupe is on the road!  Can't wait to pull that little car out and spin
it's little wheels and hopefully meet more 356'ers! (I'm in Wa. State)
I chose a coupe to make my everyday driver, maybe get out on a track?
But after the restoration...that plan went out with, somewhere between
the new floor pans and new paint. The person that restored the car,
cringes if I mention the word track.  it now sits waiting for that
season called Spring!  By the way, I am 100% female and need all the
help and advise I can find on keeping up on my little sponge. Thank you
Jimbo!   Hope to hear more from the 356's in the future!
