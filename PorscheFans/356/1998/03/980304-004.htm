Hey all!
Rumor has it that JimboMGA@aol.com made some good points:
<snipped out all the really excellent comments to make room for my little=
 comments>
	>
	I hope you don't think I just trying to provoke your ire. This list can =
be
	alot of fun and be full of great information.
	Let's go. We want you here man, on the 356/912 Engine Digest.
	Is anyone else as anxious as I am to see the next issue of "Excellence"
	with that split windshield restoration? How in the hell are they gonna =
get
	that car done?
	There, I did it. I posted something about a 356. It was easy. And I don'=
t
	know squat about em.
	Sincerely,
	JimboMGA@aol.com
	1969 912 (44/56) owes almost it's entire engine development to your 356

Wonderful post Jimbo!
I have to say, I subscribe to all but the 928 and 944 list.  I have been =
lurking for quite sometime.  I lurk because I just don't have the time =
to read everything.  Sometimes the post I read may be a week or sometimes=
 2 old!  Too old for me to post comments about.  Sometimes I get lucky =
and catch one I can make a quick and timely comment on.

The list is wonderful!  If you have any question at all, ask it and there=
 is someone out there that just did what your thinking and can steer you =
in the right direction.  And really, how hard is it to disregard the 356 =
stuff that doesn't relate to our 912?  I like having the 356 guys out the=
re.  The cars have alot in common.  Ask the 911 list who they reccomend =
to redo the soft-back window on my Targa and there is no answer.  Ask the=
 356 guys and they've been there!  Replacing your floorpans?  When was =
the last time a C4 had to replace anything but his burned out tailight? =
 Not to slam the 911 list, there are some guys that really know their stu=
ff, but the average guy there has no experience in the resoration arena.

I have a 73 914 2.0 that I'm putting back together, almost track only. =
 The 914 list is great!
I also am slowly restoring a 68 soft-back Targa.  It has all the parts =
there but needs everything to be gone thru.  I've asked in the past about=
 my Solex carbs and recvd many great responses about rebuilding them.  =
I've asked about the rear window, and now know exactley who to send it =
to.

My fondest Porsche memory?  1976, taking my Fathers wonderfully restored =
 '63 356B Cabriolet to the senior ball.  First time I was allowed to driv=
e it outside of on an auto-x course.  It was a beautiful night, the girl =
turned out to be "in like" with my best friend, but the roads were twisty=
 and the top was down.  If only I could find that car again.  Oh well, =
the 912 will have it's own memories to make.

My worst Porsche memory?  1979-80?  Taking my dad's 69 911 Targa (without=
 him knowing of course) the night Harveys Casino in South Lake Tahoe was =
supposed to blow up.  Someone had planted a huge bomb in the building and=
 it was supposed to explode at midnite.  It didn't, and we waited till =
5:00 in the am before we gave up and left for home.  Got home, (SF Bay =
area) and Dad was standing in the driveway! ooops!  Well boys will be boy=
s!  I just hope my daughter didn't inherit that gene.

Thanks!
