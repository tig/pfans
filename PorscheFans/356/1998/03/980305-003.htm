Hi p- fans,

Recently I gave my engine a tune up to pass smog, ( some of you may
remember my posts), anyway I set up the timing to spec. which is 3
degrees before TDC at idle speed.  Before the tune up, the timing was
set to about 6 degrees before TDC.  Now I rev the engine to the 5k and
6k mark fairly regularly and I have noticed that the pull when changing
gears is not quite as stong as it was before the tune up. My question is
does the engine make more power at higher RPMs with the timing more
advanced?  If it does, am I sacrificing this increase in high end power
for more less bottom end torque?  As always TIA.

BTW, I am in favor of a "new" 912 list.  I also think that the 356 list
should remain as is.
   
Michel
