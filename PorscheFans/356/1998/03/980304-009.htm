     Just wanted to join in and talk about the 356. My 1st car was a '61 356B.
I was 16 in 1978, and I paid $1000.00 of my hard earned after school job money
for it. My father had owned several 356's in the late 50's and early 60's,
including two Speedsters. They were all rough (CHEAP) cars, but he loved them
dearly.
      Like most immortal teen aged boys, I abused the hell out of my B. I
lived in the country and drove everywhere flat out. Most of my friends had
muscle cars, and I did my best to keep up with the 1600cc. After a clutch job,
using a dune-buggy Zoom clutch and lightened flywheel, I was able to amuse my
friends by lifting the front tires off the ground. I think I wound up breaking
the pinion shaft that holds the spider gears in the rear end. So much for
teenage bravado. I was always able to do the mechanical work myself, but
getting money for the parts was always a challenge. I never did break the
engine. I learned alot about both mechanicing and driving with my 356. I still
remember learning about the Pendleum effect, while leaving the roadway
backwards!
     After I got out on my own, I left the car with my dad. He used it for a
few more years, untill his health failed. The car then sat in a leaky barn for
almost 10 more years. I started a restoration, but it was too far gone for my
spare time and spare money.
    After I sold it, I got into British cars. They were cheap and fun, but not
the old Porsche. It hit me one day, they had no soul. Many of you will
understand my feelings here. Resently, I sold both my raceing Spitfire and my
street MGB, so I've been shoping for a new toy. I even looked at a few
"modern" Porsches. Great cars... Just not the same. Maybe a '64 356C......
Hope I didn't bore.
