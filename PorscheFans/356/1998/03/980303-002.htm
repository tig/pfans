Subject: Q.) When is a 356 list not a 356 list?

A.)  When we are getting only 912 listings and the 356 folks "seem" to
have moved out.
___If we (Pfans collective) have nobody 356 list interested, it's sad,
but that's that.  If we need to drop the "356" list, then lets do it.
Start a 912 list?  fine with that too.  But PLEASE stop the madness, a
912 ain't a 356!

   Mitch you really ought to know that this list is named the "356/912 Engine
Digest" at least it was when I subscribed a couple weeks ago on the webpage.
And here's the sad news... When I subscribed I got just the meagerest trickle
of a list. I swear it was a single message digest maybe every third day.
   I wish it wasn't like that. I've been on this list in the past and it was a
kickass time. More civil than the clowns over on the 911 list (that list has
some major ego problems). I recall really fantastic posts from Mr. Pellow sp.
that guy really knew his stuff, but some little weenies ran him off the list
because they didn't like his brashness "The Maestro" they scuffed and jeered.
They cost this list several really devoted and informative contributors.
   For God sake, if we're not discussing what you want to discuss, please post
a message. Engage us man, don't come on with this "Don't talk about those
cars" crap.
   I do understand your points about maybe the 356 list is dead. I don't think
it is but, I've seen it over and over, somebody posts a message about a car or
an issue they are passionate about and they get a weeks worth of posts to the
digest telling the world what a stupid jerk they are for daring to express any
such opinion. Plus as an added bonus the passionate person gets a mailbox full
of really sick and profane personal messages from folks who were too cowardly
to post to the digest. This is how a digest gets really quiet. Pretty soon all
you get is the once a week 356 digest that has that same message you saw last
week about that swapmeet next July.
   Mitch, lets talk about your car. Tell us how you got it, what's the model
year, where did you get the replacement fabric for those seats, we want to
know it all. Where do you drive it? Do you favor upgrading to disk brakes or
know some techniques for maximizing the drum mechanisms? Have you ever camped
out at a PCA event?
   There's about a half dozen cars I give a damn about and the 356 is pretty
high on that list. I don't know hardly anything about them, but the look and
sound of a well tuned 356 screamin past make me just about wet my pants.
   I hope you don't think I just trying to provoke your ire. This list can be
alot of fun and be full of great information.
   Let's go. We want you here man, on the 356/912 Engine Digest.
   Is anyone else as anxious as I am to see the next issue of "Excellence"
with that split windshield restoration? How in the hell are they gonna get
that car done?       
   There, I did it. I posted something about a 356. It was easy. And I don't
know squat about em.
Sincerely,
JimboMGA@aol.com
1969 912 (44/56) owes almost it's entire engine development to your 356
.
