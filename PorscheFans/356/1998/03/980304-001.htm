I need some  obsure parts, and contact with the guys that know truly
early cars. This is for a 1950 Coupe that I sold to a gentleman in Italy
that is doing an "Old World" style restoration. This car will be
magnificent and very important, being it was made while Ferninand was
still shuffling around the shop, August, 1950. He died in Jan. 1951.
Anyway this is what he needs.
Plastic sun visor, they only had driver side
Interior dome lite, mounted at rearview mirror
Front hood handle, repo could work
Front turn signal glass lenses, the pointy ones
Interior door and window handles w/ knobs
Plastic pieces behind handles
All plastic dash knobs, repo will work
Complete door rubber

Also does anyone know what the correct outside mirror would be?
I really wish we had Brent Johnson and Mark Turczyn on this chat line.
Are there any real experts that have been laying low out there? Please
come forward.

Thanks,  Stephen Demosthenes
