Subject: 912 HoodStruts

I have just purchased a 69 912 coupe.  In the truck is a broom handle. 
You all know what that is for.  My question is; in looking at the
Automotion catalog, they show original equipment hood struts ($28 / pr.)
and "better" ones ($50 /Pr). Are the "btter" ones that much better? 
Does anyone have another source for these?

Speaking as a person who has sustained some pretty painful back injuries from
the hood latch slamming down right between my shoulderblades, Oww is right.
Spend the extra money for the best of the best. It's worth the cash.
Performance has what they call the "Life Time Waranty" hood shock. $29.99
1800-423 3173. They even go as far as to give you twenty percent off if you
buy the rear one too. $29.95 for the rear.
That hood can come down so damned fast. Saving you the embarasment of looking
like your car is trying to swallow you is worth the money. Burn the broom
handle.
