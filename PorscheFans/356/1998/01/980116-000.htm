Greetings Everyone (did I hear an echo?),

Are there any definitive places to look for a 356 that is intact, original,
without structural rust and restorable?  A 356 has been my and my wifes'
dream car for quite a few years now.  I would be able to handle any and all
repairs/restoration, but would prefer something that has not yet been
touched.  I hesitate to take a basket case and by all means want to stay
away from something that has been repaired on the cheap.  Relatedly, I don't
want anything that the owner claims to already have had "restored" because I
found out that the state of being "restored" can mean anything from
show-quality example of meticulous pedantry to a horror with pop-riveted
patches, 1" thich patches of bondo, a $99 paint job and black paint on the
cracked window rubber (unfortunately, this was a personal experience)

The price range for such a model I am sure would range from $5,000 to
$25,000.  Has it been anyone's experience to find something on the lower end
of this scale?

Thanks much!
