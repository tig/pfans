Hey Mike, everyone,
As of 1/1/98 your car falls under CA SB42, which smog exempts all cars
1973 or older. I'd just call DMV and tell them to release the sticker,
that this car falls under SB42 and doesn't require smog testing. (I had a
similar situation) As for tuning, it's a good idea to get things right as
we Do want to have clean air...

BTW: Mike if you want to discuss stuff in more detail(tuning specifics)
contact me direct....I've been through it.....  sks@itsa.ucsf.edu
