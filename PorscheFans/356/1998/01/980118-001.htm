I attempted to reply direct, but your address wouldn't compute.  Hopefully,
someone on the Registry list will reply to the PorscheFans list, or, maybe
they will end up sending me a reply and I will forward it.

>>>To: 911@PorscheFans.com
>>>Subject: Tuning info
>>>
>>>Hi Porsche Fans,
>>>
>>>I need some advice and information on engine tuning. I have a 66 912.
>>>The engine was rebuilt 10,000 miles ago (shortly after which it passed
>>>the CA smog check with flying colors). It also runs with the original
>>>Solex 40 PII carbs and the P & Cs are NPR 1720 Big Bore.  Two months ago
>>>I received a notice from the DMV saying that my car should have to pass
>>>another smog check before I could receive the registration sticker. 
>>>I felt that my car was running very well and I also felt confident that
>>>it would pass the smog test with NO problem. I WAS SOOO WRONG. Going for
>>>the smog check that day was probably the dumbest thing I have done in
>>>the past year. You all have probably guessed by now that the car failed
>>>the test. 
>>>There are two parts to this CA smog check.  The first part of the test
>>>checks emissions at idle RPM and the 2nd phase checks the emissions at
>>>2500 RPM.  During this test my car failed the idle portion of the test
>>>but passed the 2500 RPM part.  I do not have the emission results from
>>>this test.  Needless to say, I was quite dissappointed but I thought
>>>positively and decided that this had all happened for a reason.  This
>>>was also a good time to give my motor a tune up.
>>>I replaced the plugs, air cleaners, points, condenser, distributor cap,
>>>and fuel filter. I set the timing to 3 degrees BTDC at 900 rpm which is
>>>the set idle speed.  The carb linkage was adjusted and I was now ready
>>>for a smog retest. 
>>>I brought the car in for a retest this morning after driving it for
>>>about a half hour to make sure it was completely warmed up. This time,
>>>the car passed the idle portion of the test but failed the 2500 RPM part
>>>of the test.  At 2500 RPM the measured HC ppm was 622 with the max.
>>>allowable being 600.  The smog tech mentioned something about making the
>>>mixture richer to correct this.  I don't really remember since I was
>>>very annoyed with the test results.
>>>Can anyone help with my situation.  If I need to make the mixture
>>>richer, does that mean changing the main jets size?  What is the
>>>relationship of the mixture to the HCs and CO%. I appreciate all
>>>input .TIA
>>>
>>>Michel Lauzon
