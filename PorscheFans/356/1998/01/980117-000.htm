Hi Porsche Fans,

I need some advice and information on engine tuning. I have a 66 912.
The engine was rebuilt 10,000 miles ago (shortly after which it passed
the CA smog check with flying colors). It also runs with the original
Solex 40 PII carbs and the P & Cs are NPR 1720 Big Bore.  Two months ago
I received a notice from the DMV saying that my car should have to pass
another smog check before I could receive the registration sticker. 
I felt that my car was running very well and I also felt confident that
it would pass the smog test with NO problem. I WAS SOOO WRONG. Going for
the smog check that day was probably the dumbest thing I have done in
the past year. You all have probably guessed by now that the car failed
the test. 
There are two parts to this CA smog check.  The first part of the test
checks emissions at idle RPM and the 2nd phase checks the emissions at
2500 RPM.  During this test my car failed the idle portion of the test
but passed the 2500 RPM part.  I do not have the emission results from
this test.  Needless to say, I was quite dissappointed but I thought
positively and decided that this had all happened for a reason.  This
was also a good time to give my motor a tune up.
I replaced the plugs, air cleaners, points, condenser, distributor cap,
and fuel filter. I set the timing to 3 degrees BTDC at 900 rpm which is
the set idle speed.  The carb linkage was adjusted and I was now ready
for a smog retest. 
I brought the car in for a retest this morning after driving it for
about a half hour to make sure it was completely warmed up. This time,
the car passed the idle portion of the test but failed the 2500 RPM part
of the test.  At 2500 RPM the measured HC ppm was 622 with the max.
allowable being 600.  The smog tech mentioned something about making the
mixture richer to correct this.  I don't really remember since I was
very annoyed with the test results.
Can anyone help with my situation.  If I need to make the mixture
richer, does that mean changing the main jets size?  What is the
relationship of the mixture to the HCs and CO%. I appreciate all
input .TIA
