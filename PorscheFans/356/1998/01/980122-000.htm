Hi P-fans,
I was at work today and one of my co-workers who has the luxury of =
coming in at 12pm told me that Speedvision featured a ducumentary on =
Porsche from the first car produced to present day.  Yeah...that's right =
I'm sitting at work at a computer terminal while a show on mine and your =
favorite car was on.....aaaargh!    I missed it. =20
My point to all this is that, I was wondering if anyone got a copy of =
this on video tape that would be willing to dub a copy for me.  I'm =
willing to pay a fee (obiously to outrageous).  I'll pay for the =
shipping involved. =20
So if you were lucky enough to get a copy and can help me on my quest =
please e-mail me.
Thanks again
Happy Porsche-ing

Subject: Satin finish on windshield posts

The windshield posts and trim from a 61 Roadster have small rubbed and
scratched areas.  Simichrome only polishes this area and removes the satin
finish.
How is the Satin finish restored to these surfaces?
Are these pieces anodized?
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.
Thank You,
