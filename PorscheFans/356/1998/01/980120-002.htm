I've recently acquired a 57 356A that was brought from the west to the
midwest seven years ago.  The bottom is coated with "surface rust" as
are the wheelwells.  My first priority is to manage the rust.  There are
so many products.  POR 15.  Eastwood's "corrolless".  And Extend got
favorable write-ups in the Registry (reprinted in the restoration
guide).  There's also the option of media-blasting.  Or just cleaning,
etching, and priming.  Anyone have experience/educated opinions/advice? 
The car is exceptional, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Thanks,
Bill

has anyone there tried the BFG Comp T/A R1's 285/70-15's. I've sold several
sets of heat cycled R1's to some 356 vintage racers that seem to be smiling a
lot. One customer has taken a fairly long (1500 mile) trip that included
mountain roads and rain and was pretty happy. 

Does anyone else out there have experience with these or other tires that they
like a lot on a 356?

I'm about half way through restoring a 356 Cab and tires options are something
that I'll be looking at soom
