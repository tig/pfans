>I will contribute what information I can.

>For starters, are you aware of the new California smog law?  After it
>takes effect, no car of '73 and older will have to be smog checked
>any longer.  I believe it takes effect around March 1, but I'm not
>sure of that.  If you can wait that long, perhaps you can just skip
>it entirely.  I don't know what the situation is for cars which
>required a smog check, but didn't get it, before the new law takes
>effect.  But it might be worth looking into.
> 
>Regarding failing idling:  It's always a good idea to lean out the
>idle mixtures just before a smog test.  With the the engine warm,
>set all four idle mixture screws until the engine slows slightly
>from its optimum (fastest) idle speed.  This can be a little tricky
>because you are setting them one cylinder at a time and the effect
>of each on the engine is slight, but the cumulative effect is great.
> 
>Regarding the 2,500 RPM test:  HC is hydrocarbon, which is unburned
>gasoline.  When the car fails this test just slightly, as yours did,
>the mixture should be leaned slightly not made richer.  I think the
>tech was confused.  If an engine is leaned too much the HC will
>actually rise because the engine is stumbling and occasionally a
>cylinder will not fire at all, so the entire intake charge of that
>cylinder is passed through to the exhaust, unburned.  Of course, if
>the engine is occasionally stubling for any reason (not necessarily
>being too lean) it will cause this to happen.  Dirty plugs?  Weak
>ignition?  Dirty air cleaners?
> 
>But if the engine wasn't stumbling for any reason, I wouldn't know what
>to suggest except leaning the main jets slightly.
>
>I hope the above will help.  Let me know how you do.
