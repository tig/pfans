Michael,
Who is this tech? He should be reported to BAR (Dept. of Consumer
Affairs).
As of  October 9, 1997 your car became exempt from smog testing in
California.
How is that for good  news?
Technically, you should not have received the notice from the state, but
the
entire system is computerized and may or may not ever be updated for the

exemption. For your records, the pertinent legislation is SB 42
introduced by
Senator Quentin Kopp, SF on 12-2-96, subsequently amended, passed by the

governor on 10-8-97 and chaptered the next day. Following is an
abstract:
  SB 42   Kopp
               Air Pollution: Vehicles: Inspection and Maintenance
               Prior law exempted motor vehicles prior to the 1966
               model year from the biennial Smog Check and from having
               to obtain a Smog Check upon initial registration,
ownership
               changes, or upon import from other states into
California.

               This statute changes these exemptions from model years
               prior to 1974 until 2003 when the exemptions will be for
               vehicles thirty model-years old and earlier. (H&S C =A7
               44011; and Veh C =A7 4000.1)
                                                              Chapter
801
                                                              Statutes
of 1997

So lower your emissions, by all means, as best you can, but relax. And
get a
refund.
