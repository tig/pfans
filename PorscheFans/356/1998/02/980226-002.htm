Wow, those are gonna be some tough parts to find. I gave all my best catalogs
a search and didn't come up with much.
Give Doc & Cys a call at 1800-950-0356 they have a listing in their catalog
for your interior door Panels (this is a great catalog, ask them to send you
one) 
part #U723 for material on board
$259.50 for the vinyl   $499.50 for the leather
I hope you get some better answers from the others.
I've never seen a 912 prior to the 1969 model with door lock cylinders. And my
not finding them in any of my catalogs or my list of available options for the
912 makes me doubt they have ever been available.
Are your handles broken/missing or are you looking for ones with locks to
replace your sans lock handles?
There was a really beat up 1968 912 for sale in my area (Omaha, Nebraska) a
couple months back. I'll make some calls tomorrow to see if it is still
available or where it went. It had an immaculate windshield. The rest of the
car was a nightmare. It would be good for small bits and bolts. If I can track
it down I'll see if they would be willing to part it out.
The 912 is quite hard to find some parts for. The "Bargain Basement Porsche"
image it generally has really skews the parts market for 912 specific parts.
My 1969 912 is a bit easier because it shared almost all interior parts with
the base 911T E & S. But I still can't find a replacement for my two rusty
chrome wheels. When I do find them it will be worth it.
The 912 fits my driving so well. The balance is just delightful. Much better
than the 911.
Keep looking, the parts are out there. Good luck.
