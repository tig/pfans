Hey Fiddle, Fiddle-
(sorry, couldn't help that one)

I also have a 68 Softback Targa that I am starting to restore.  I do have=
 all the parts for mine but have found some great resources.  One is this=
 list.  I subscribe to pretty much all of them, 911,914, racing etc. and =
alot of times if the answer isn't here on the 912 list someone elsewhere =
knows it.
I can't remember who, but someone also started a 912 registry.  I signed =
up immediatley and now have quite a few people on email I can ask questio=
ns to. (I think it was Beckers@prodigy or something, hopefully he sent =
you an email as well)

As far as companies to do the work...
for interior and top repair etc.  most people have referred me to Autos =
International.
For the Key parts, replacement sheet metal, badges, etc, Doc & Cy's has =
been the concensus.
Somebody in Salinas restores the seats, not just recovers but redoes the =
springs and the sliders.
For head work, an awful lot of people liked Mark Stephens High Performanc=
e and as a matter of fact they are in the process of doing a 914 head for=
me now.
As for reference material, I like the Restores Guide for somethings.  You=
 may see from time to time, Charlie White selling copies of exploded view=
 diagrams for the 912.  I bought this from him and it is an ok resource. =
 It is a xerox of a (euro I believe) parts diagram.  The drawings are goo=
d, the copies are of poor to good quality, and there is very little engli=
sh and almost no labels for the parts.  But if you know what you're looki=
ng at and you want to see if this goes on before that, they're a good thi=
ng to have.
I can go on and on, and I will.  Just let me know what more info you need=
 and I'll expand on it.  I'm not at my usual computer so I don't have all=
 the info right here.

Good luck-
Mikey

Remember:
     the truth is out there
