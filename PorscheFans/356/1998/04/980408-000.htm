I wouldn't feel shy about offering less than that, all those rust bubbles =
indicate a poor patch job(read bondo) underneath that paint. Did you take a =
=
magnet with you to check for metal? If the magnet don't stick, it ain't =
metal! I made that same mistake when I bought a '68 912 about 8 years ago. =
The guy told me he had it stripped down to bare metal and repainted, he'd =
gone from green to black. There were a couple paint bubbles that he tried to=
 =
pass off as just bad paint, when it actually was bondo under the paint that =

was exposed on the backsides of the fenders. Over the years it naturally got=

worse, I'm now putting on new front fenders, fixing the rest of the rust and=

changing the color to white. The guy was asking $6500 for the car, he =
probably had that much in it, my first offer to him was $4000 considering =
the unknowns under the paint. I ended up paying $4800 for it and have had a =

lot of fun with it. I like working on the car, it's fun. The point is, don't=

pay too much for a car that has rust. In the process of fixing the rusted =
out parts, you will ALWAYS find other stuff to fix, but that's fun too.

Many thanks to all that responded to my request for opinions regarding my
possible purchase of a '64 SC coupe.  You were unanimous in your advice
not to buy, especially at the asking price of $15,000.  One responder
suggested $9,000, another alluded to $10,000.  So, I will either forget
this one or make an offer of perhaps $10,000 - but will do so out of his
reach :-)
