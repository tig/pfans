Hey all-
Here's a second opinion.
I bought from Charlie both the 914 and 912 books.
I have no interest in Charlie or his business, just a customer.

On the good side:  The books come in a binder and the diagrams are copied=
 from some sort of euro workshop manual.The diagrams are clear and good =
drawings.  The books were shipped promptly and delivered in good conditio=
n.

On the Negative side: There is no table of contents or labels for the par=
ts. So you have to be able to identify what your looking at.=20 And then,=
 when you found a picture of that bolt your missing, there is no way to =
tell what size it is.  Some of my pages are cut off at the tops, or print=
ed a little askew, probably the result of mass copy machining. (is that =
a word?)

In the end, I am a happy customer, I feel that combined with my Clymers =
and others, I can get through most anything.  The price is fine by me. =
 Just don't expect anything other than what they are described as; 912 =
Exploded-View Part Diagrams

Just my .02!

Thanks!
