A trick I learned in woodworking was to fill those half full cans of =
'air-dry' finishes with marbles to take up that volume of air so there is no=
 =
air there to cure the paint/varnish/shellac/por15/etc. Works fine, just =
don't tell your children what you did with their marble collection!

Although I've never used the POR 15 product it sounds very similar to  Rust=

Guard  made by a German company named Wurth. Rust Guard is an air dried =
epoxy.
Air is the catalyst. Thats why you need to seal the lid carefully. I used t=
o
have this problem with Rust Guard, then discovered that all I needed to do =
=
was
punch a small hole in the lid with my utility knife let the paint out (less=

spillage too) and reseal it with a piece or two of masking tape. This
procedure increased the shelf live  until about half way thru the quart .
After that transfer it to a smaller container for longer shelf live.
