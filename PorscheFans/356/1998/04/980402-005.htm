As the subject line implies, this is for all of those people on the various
Pfans lists who intend on going to Parade this year.

Some of us on the 924-944 list have been having a discussion this past week
or two on the possibility of arranging a Pfans meeting of sorts in
Steamboat Springs during Parade week.

What I would like to propose is that a member of each list help to
coordinate this "happening".  I guess, that since I am the person sending
this out, I would be the 924-944-968 representative.  I realize that not
too many listmembers monitor more than 1 or 2 lists on a regular basis, so
I figured that it might work best with the "coordinator" regime.

There have been suggestions brought forth for one or more "events":
	1)	A social evening of libations, either at someone's guest
quarters or at a public establishment;
	2)	A driving tour on some fun roads, with either a lunch or
dinner "en route".  Of course, this would/should severely limit the
quantity of liquid refreshment served.

The driving tour would certainly be a lot of fun, but since the listmembers
drive a variety of cars in the autocross, I don't think this would be easy
to accomplish (I will be autocrossing on Tuesday afternoon, and will be in
the rallye on Friday).  However, this would not preclude smaller groups
from touring on their own.

Does anyone know JoAnn Barnum (Parade Registrar) well?  I thought it would
be nice to get some signage in the registration area, along with something
on the bulletin board in Hospitality.  What would be really great is to
have a table of our own at Registration, but I don't know if PCA/Parade
regulations would allow that.

Another idea would be to have some buttons made up with the Pfans logo and
possibly a sticker with the person's e-mail address to put on the button.
There has also been talk of having either small window decals or larger
windshield appliques made, but nothing has been confirmed as yet.

If anyone on any of the Pfans lists has any suggestions, comments, etc.,
please let me know, either directly or thru the 924-944 list.  I am in the
"live" mode on the 944 list, but get digests on the 356, 911, 914, 928,
Boxster, and General lists.  If any other "groups" have already planned
something, let me know about it and maybe we can coordinate.

Thanks for your time and bandwidth.
