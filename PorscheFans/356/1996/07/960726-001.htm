Hi Bob,

In a message dated 96-07-26 12:01:35 EDT, you write:

(snip)
<<        The vote is evenly split on whether I need to go leaner than stock,
 or richer than stock (no one recommended using the stock jets.)  As to
 verifying correct mixture, most felt that plug color was the way to do it.
 The major disenting opinion was that you can't get it right w/o an exhaust
 gas analyzer, because of the sensitivity of the mixture to jetting, and
 subjectiveness of plug color.  I think the key here is access to a gas
 analyzer such that you can play with it w/o paying through the nose.  No
 opinions were expressed regarding potential engine damage due to running too
 rich or lean.

It's a little more complicated than that.  Yes the only way to know for sure
is with an EGA, but it needs to be used with a dyno which is the only way you
can load the engine.  Either chassis or engine will work, but chassis is more
convenient.  Most people who have a chassis dyno use it in conjunction with
an EGR to give you mixture under load which is what you *really* need to
know.  

As far as damage is concerned, too rich will drop the horsepower a bit but
will cause no serious damage unless it's *way* too rich in which case it
could start washing down the cylinder walls.  Too lean is another story.
 This will lead to detonation which can put little (and sometimes big) holes
in pistons and heads. :-(

One final possibility is the use of a portable EGA which runs on 6 (12?)
volts and a helper.  Then testing can be done under load as it needs to be.
 My advice would be to rent a couple of hours of dyno time and sort it out
properly.

If I had to make a guess as to what needed to be done, based on the increase
in displacement and the accompanying increase in CR, it would need to be a
little richer than stock, however there are other variables such as exhaust
system, cam etc. which enter into the equation.
