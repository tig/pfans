All,

        Suspecting overly rich fuel/air mixture due to drilled out main
jets, and heeding group advice on using plug color to check same, I did a
little playing this weekend.  First I warmed the engine up (this procedure
is no fun if you can't burn your knuckles.)  Then a brief full throttle pull
followed by cutting the ignition and coasting to a stop.  Here I tried to
time my test such that i could coast to a wide shoulder under a shade tree.
I did this a couple of times, checking 3 of the 4 plugs.  The porcelain is
white - clean, as is the center electrode.  The ground electrode varies.
There is black soot where the electrode connects to the plug body.  On each
plug, the black soot continues a little up the electrode, more on some than
others, but never to the bend in the electrode.  One electrode was
grey/brown on the end.  The other two were clean, almost shiney on the end.

        The plugs are Bosch Copper  W6D-whatever, the standard for an SC
engine, and have about 5k miles on them.  Conclusions?  It certainly doesn't
look like I'm running too rich, right?  I guess I'm inclined to quit
fiddling with it and assume the jets are OK.  BTW, these tests were done w/o
changing any jets.
