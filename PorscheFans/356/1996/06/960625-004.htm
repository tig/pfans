I have developed a peculiar addiction to a motorcar. Judging by the large
number of individuals affected, it may be communicable. Unquestionably, the
disease started in Germany but has spread worldwide. Some (like my wife)
think the disorder to be mental.

The back seat is far too small for that.

>C. Have you ever been or are you now involved in espionage or sabotage; or in

>involved, in any way, in persecutions associated with Nazi Germany or its
