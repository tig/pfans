Bruce Anderson has been lurking on PorscheFans for a while but now it's time
to make an official announcement. 

Beyond the usual posting of messages to the list in the hopes that somebody
knows the answer, PorscheFans can now post technical questions to Bruce
directly. As soon as we expand the number of sections, I want to give Bruce
his own department, "Ask Bruce Anderson" or some such, but until then he's
going to be found mostly in the 911 section. 

Bruce brings to PorscheFans his wealth of Porsche experience in general and
911 expertise in particular. He is the author of "The Porsche 911 Performance
Handbook," a standard reference on the car. He has written for just about
every Porsche magazine on the planet, and in a previous life was one of the
principals behind Garretson Enterprises, at one time one of the country's
finest independent Porsche service facilities and also a winning racing
organization. Bruce and his brother Clark have been involved with Porsches
since the days when 356s were new and 911s didn't exist.

Having Bruce online sort of makes "The 911 Performance Handbook" an
interactive medium rather than a read-only device.
