Greetings 356'rs

(although this original note was for the 356 registry folks...I "cc'd" to
p-fans 356 and 911 groups-my apologies for the inevitable, subsequent cross
postings)

Recently, I was foraging through some photos that I have taken from past
events at Monterey, CA. I came across a nice 3/4 frontal shot of a gorgeous
silver 356A Coupe.  I took this picture at the '93 Monterey Historics.  (I
think it was '93) it was the "Miller Year"...same event Hans Stuck showed
up with the Penske-Donahue 917/30 from the Porsche Museum.

What really got my attention was the custom bumper on the front.  This
bumper was nothing more than a polished (chrome-plated?) tube mounted low
and following the body contour , leading from wheel well to wheel well.  As
a bumper, I'm sure it's totally useless, but boy does it ever fit the
character of the car!
Other features were:
- mesh headlight covers
- leather hood straps
- chrome wheels (no hubcaps)
- Silver paint with two lipstick-red stripes running down center, from
bumper to bumper
- "356" very nicely stenciled or painted on side (this may have been just
for the event...)

I'd like to find and contact the owner of this lovely tub...just to yak and
ask questions.
-Am I talking about any of you folks?
-Anyone know who owns this car? (and how I might get ahold of him/her?)

Thanks for the help...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
