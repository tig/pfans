Hmmmm. This looks like the place, right house number, although it's hard to
read on this early, cool morning as the sun slowly rises to my left. No
lights on. I'll just knock lightly since the guy is expecting me to come
this early to look at the motorcycle he has for sale. 

"Oh, hi," he says as he opens the door, "I've been expecting you, the rest
of the family is still asleep, I just get up this early to go to work. Come
on around to the side of the house and I'll open the garage door and show
you the bike." 

OK, I hope I can get through with this quick, I'm almost late to work, but I
really want to see this motorcycle. He slowly pulls the door up from the
ground and as it rolls up I see the bike sitting sideways just inside the
door, the lower part of the tires, then the wheels, fenders, motor, gas
tank, and, GASP!!! That's an early model PORSCHE sitting behind the bike,
covered in dust, and just visible in the darkness! "I, uh, I, ..... nice
bike, but man, I think I'm more interested in your Porsche!" 

Well, to make a long story shorter, he said he needed to sell it too, but
wasn't ready since he didn't know what they were worth, and it used to be
his Mom's, so he was having a hard time parting with it. So, I bought the
motorcycle (at his asking price) and cultivated a friendship with him and
after three months he called me up and said he was ready to sell it! So, I
bought it!

After buying a book on early Porsches I found out that it is a common model
and the lowest horsepower model for the year. It's a 1962 356B, Reutter T6
Coupe with the 60hp engine. It has a script "60" below the deck lid. Dark
blue with red interior. Also, the numbers on the chassis and engine match
for a 60hp model. The neat thing about it is that it is in excellent
condition, other than not being driven in ten years. It came from
Bakersfield, California, a dry place and only has surface corrosion in the
tire storage area. It's so original that it still has the standard
hubcaps/wheel covers (baby moons) instead of the prettier, optional (for the
"1600 normal" Porsche), hubcaps/wheel covers. (I think I'm correct on this.)

My question to you all is who you recommend for parts that I need to
replace,  like rear window rubber, brake lines, engine seals, and so on.
There are lots of sellers in the magazines, ("Excellence" for example), but
who do the experts (you all) recommend as your favorites?

Another question. What is the recommended method for dealing with the minor
corrosion (rust) in the spare tire/battery area? 

I love this car already! I had a 1961 1600 Super Coupe when I was going to
college then sold it to pay for the first kid after I graduated, so now that
my kids are grown I have another Porsche! Life is good! Can't wait to drive it!

I just found this list earlier this week and hope that you can help me with
this important (to me) project!  TIA!
