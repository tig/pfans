Bob Albrecht of the Racing Albrecht Non-Brothers asked 

>I'm tired of wondering/worring about my oil pressure.  What are the
options re installing an oil pressure gauge in a 6v. SC coup?  The interior
is restored/original, so I don't want to punch a hole in the dash.  Does
someone market a 6v. gauge/sender kit.  I guess it should be VDO to match.
Has anyone installed something they would recommend?

Hi, Bob. I still have a dual-purpose sender installed on my car, fooled with
reading oil press for a while using the fuel level gauge but finally got
bored and returned it to acting only as a warning light switch. (The temp
sender is elsewhere, right next to the stock low pressure contact, but goes
into the block sideways). I used a trim pot to calibrate the oil pressure
sensor output to give something resembling pressure in bar on the fuel gauge,
at least at higher pressure. The fuel gauge is nonlinear though. Somebody who
wants to fool around with some transistors for logic or whatever can probably
make it work pretty well. I set mine up to read "4/4" (full tank) at 4 bar,
"2/4" at 2 bar, and below that it's at idle anyway.

Here's some notes I made on my conversion.

Note that VDO oil pressure sender has M 10 x 1 K threads.
Markings on sender: G (for Geber, which is transducer) and WK (for
Warnkontakt). Two M4 binding
posts. Sender labelled 0-5 bar, Date stamp 3.94, 0.5+-0.15 bar is warning
contact activation pressure.  Another number, 30/2, is probably model number.
This was VDO part number 360 006. Price $31.50.

Old switch bears VW-Audi logo (4 rings), 0.15...0.45, made in Brazil,
021919081B.
