Bob-
I have done exactly what you are thinking about.  I too did not want to
make any extra holes, so I hung two gauges on a bracket under the dash.
It doesn't look too terrible,and it is a reversable situation. For the
sender I used a Bosch unit that is a combination pressure sender and idiot
light switch.  I can look at the numbers on the unit if you need them.

Regards
Tom Smith
**********************************************************

I did likewise, using senders and instruments ordered from 
Imparts. (Forget the "wiring kit" -- just 40 cents worth of 
wire!) The under-dash bracket can be painted to match the 
car and the instruments have green numerals on black faces 
with "VDO" on them! They look as if they belonged there. 
The only catch is that the temperature reading is arbitrary 
and requires comparison with a reliable measurement to know 
what is going on! (This despite an exchange with a 
complaint to the maker --see below.) Come to think of it --
maybe I should check the pressure reading too sometime?! 
(It usually stands at or around 40 p/si at 3-4000 rpm.)
