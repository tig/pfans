Jody Williams reports on his find of a really good condition blue/red 60 hp
356.:

<< My question to you all is who you recommend for parts that I need to
 replace,  like rear window rubber, brake lines, engine seals, and so on.
 There are lots of sellers in the magazines, ("Excellence" for example), but
 who do the experts (you all) recommend as your favorites?
 
Lots of good ones out there, plus some turkeys with high prices. I buy almost
everything I need from Bill Perrone at The Parts Shop in Huntington Beach,
CA, tel. 1-714-894-3112. You'll probably reach Bud, not Bill, same thing
though.

On an equal footing with Bill (but just not local, so I don't get as much
stuff from him) is Brad Ripley at NLA Ltd. in Sparks, NV. 1-800-438-8119.

Oh, almost forgot Stoddard. They're owned by the Porsche family (not Porsche
Cars North America) and they have lots of stuff -- usualy at Porsche prices.
Sometimes they're the sole source. 1-800-342-1414.

>> Another question. What is the recommended method for dealing with the
minor
 corrosion (rust) in the spare tire/battery area? 
 
Mechanic Excuse #!: "They all do that." How bad did yours do it? It's caused
by acid vapor from the battery, which lives in that area. If the bottom of
this so-called battery box does not yet resemble swiss cheese, you might be
able to save it without welding in a new bottom panel (available, and at a
good price, but doing a good welding job requires some skill). You might want
to remove the paint inside and out to see how bad it is. For this I like to
use an abrasive wheel in a small air grinder (die grinder). Or a wire brush
in a drill motor (NOT in a die grinder!!! Hand grenade!) With or without the
paint removed, since it's acid, neutralize with a baking soda solution, dry
thoroughly, Now you can reprime (I like DuPont Variprime, but use a good
respirator), followed by DuPont Centari semi-gloss black inside and out,
followed by an application of Wuerth SKS Black stone guard. That should
protect it from future attack. 

If the bottom is pretty well beat up from parking by Braille, you may want to
replace it. To do it right, you should have somebody drill out the old spot
welds and weld the new bottom right back where it belongs. Done properly, the
bottom panel rests on about a 1/2" "ledge" formed in the bottom edges of the
battery box/spare tire well sides. The idea is to try to preserve those
ledges, not just hack them off. If they are already rusted away, a really
good restoration job involves fabricating new lower extremities to the side
pieces, with the ledges, and butt welding them on and grinding the weld flush
for appearance. Check fit of new piece using cardboard mockups before you
trim it to size. Make sure battery will fit in its space on new bottom. For a
concours-quality job, see Bill Perrone for tarpaper pads under battery, Brad
Ripley has the polyethylene sheet that goes between those and the battery,
and you'll probably have to cover the end of the heavy steel angle bracket
that holds the battery from side to side with a piece of innertube for a
finished look. Don't paint the angle bracket where it goes inside the sheet
metal "U", that and the bolt that holds it is what connects the ground strap
to the chassis. You'll also need to rivet on a new tow hook. The hooks and
rivets are readily available, but it helps to make a bucking bar for these
rivets, and an air riveter to do it right. 

If you don't need a new bottom, consider yourself lucky, just clean and paint
what you've got.

Good luck,

Pete
