>Hi there-I'm not sure if I'm in the right place-but I thought maybe someone
could help me out-

Yup, This is one right place. The Porsche 356 Registry also has a mail list,
with more traffic. Don't recall their address though.

>I'm looking for some engine parts for my father-in-law who has a 1962 356
Porsche-he wanted me to try and locate a classified page on the Internet-

>Any help would be appreciated-He's more interested in parts in Northern
California, ie San Francisco Bay Area-

Lots of places in N. Cal. So. Cal too, if you don't mind the UPS shipping.
Although I live in So. Cal, my engine builder lives in San Jose and I have no
problem with the 400 mile trip. He can probably help you with parts and info.
Clark Anderson, brother of the more famous Bruce, can be reached at
1-408-266-3191.  For parts, you could also try Parts Heaven, El Cerito, CA,
1-415-526-6364 or 1-800-767-7250.

Here in southern California I get almost all of my parts from Bill Perrone at
The Parts Shop. Parts Shop has a web site now (I just put it up Wednesday
night); go to the PorscheFans home page, click on Marketplace, click on The
Parts Shop. It's not an online catalog yet but the basic info is there. Or if
you don't want to do that, the phone number is 1-714-894-3112. Tell Bill or
Bud you saw it on the Internet.
