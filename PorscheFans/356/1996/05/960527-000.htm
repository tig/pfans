Found this on the Porsche 356 Registry list. Since I had something useful to
contribute, I figured I'd copy it to this list. 

BTW, anybody who owns a 356 and is not a subscriber to the 356 Registry list
will be taken out behind the barn and have their battery boxes revoked. It is
a dedicated list; we have a 356 section here for the sake of completeness,
but the Registry list is THE list for 356s. If you have a 356 you need to
join that list too, and you should also think about becoming a member of the
356 Registry. Their magazine is outstanding. 

To join the Registry mail list, send an e-mail to
porsche-356-registry@world.std.com and ask for info. They have a digest mode
too.

Here's the message I'm copying:

Hi, Clark.

It's thick jute padding. Bill Perrone at The Parts Shop (714-894-3112, fax
714-894-8694) sells this and most other precut textile padding and sound
deadening kits for the trunk and engine compartment (tarpaper, jute/tarpaper
combinations, etc.) The gas tank pads are relatively cheap. They come precut
and are absolutely indistinguishable from original. You install them with
contact cement.
