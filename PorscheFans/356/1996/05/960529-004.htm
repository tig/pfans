Hi Brad,

I may have one of these in my garage that I bought with a pile of other 912 
stuff I can't use.  The distributor has been rebuilt and is supposedly 
perfect except for the vacuum hose connection on the advance diaphram 
housing was broken off and reattached using some sort of mystery glue.  It 
worked though.  If you're interested, I'll make you a deal!
