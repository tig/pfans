GB writes, in reference to the Parade Concours >>The overall preparation
award (the new manhattan trophy :-))...<<

I thought the "Manhattan Trophy" was retired after the 1995 event.
A few lines prior to the snipped line the author even mentions this fact.

While I too attended the Parade, including the Awards banquet, it was my
distinct impression there were overall winners in each division.
By the above referenced barometer, each is a 'new manhattan trophy' winner-
yes?

My thought that the Concours had been redesigned to be friendlier, less
rigid, less inhospitable, is wrong of course.  It is impossible to have those
kinds of investments represented in a subjective judging environment without
stress.
Stress equals strife, and controversy blossoms [as it did this year.]
No point rehashing the specific instances, there is a wide latitude for
interpretation (hence the arguments).

That some cars come out of hiding infrequently through the year, to touch the
ground for a few hours, and then be hustled away like rare gems.... well,
they cease to be cars -IMHO.

For the record; Overall Preservation award went to an orange 914 from New
Jersey (I think), Overall Restoration Award went to Steve Heinrichs in a 1955
Carrera Speedster, and Peoples Choice went to Denny Frick in his 9014/6*.
There was no 'Overall Overall' award, one stellar example over all others was
not chosen this year.
Although the Peoples Choice could be construed as such.  Everyone who toured
the Concours had a vote.  They selected the best car, over all others.  It
would seem this the obvious candidate for 'new manhattan trophy'.  At least,
one would think.

*Yes, nine oh fourteen slash six, not a typo.  Based on a 914 tub, rear
suspension and bananas in place, six cylinder power plant, completely
fabricated front end, and authentic hand laid fiberglass panels from a 904.
 Details deserving of close attention, lovingly reproduced replica, striking
in appearance.
Oh yeah, and there's a picture of Wolfgang Porsche standing next to it,
complimenting Frick on a job well done.
