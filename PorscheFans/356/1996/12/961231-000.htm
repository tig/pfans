I,ve recently rebuilt the engine and carbs on my '63 B but now the 
engine bay always smells of fuel and it's a pig to start. I think that 
it may have something to do with the adjustment of the floats, does 
this seem right?

There are no fuel line leaks to account for the smell so I,m assuming
it's a problem with the carbs. Can't say if they were alright before
as a bought them second hand - I had single choke Solex previously !

If you could let me know the correct procedure for checking the float
height that would be great. I know the measurement I just don't know 
what exactly to measure. 

Thanks very much

Jim Bartholomew
