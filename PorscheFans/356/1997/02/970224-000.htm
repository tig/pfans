 Hi Everyone,
 I have a few questions, that hopefully someone out there can help me find
the answers to.
 I rebuilt my 912 engine with a big bore kit the year before last, did the
works, shotpeened, balanced, repainted, replated, even all new decals. It
was a very sobering experience after working on air cooled VWs for a long
time. I am currently a student again, so I couldn't afford to look at the
transmission. Actually, I am terrified to open up a transmission. Engine
work is great, but I think transmission work is a little out of my and my
tools league. 
 To make a long story short (too late for that, huh?), here are my
questions :
   1) I want to have my transmission rebuilt. I've been told that it would
be cheaper to find a used one. I realize for collector purposes it would
be best to have the original tranny, but I would hold on to it should I
replace it anyway.
   2) I was wondering what years of the 912/911/914 trannies had the best
gearing for highway motoring, that would fit into my car.
   3) The original reason I pulled the engine in the first place, was
because I dropped a throw out bearing. I got a little carried away and
redid everything. I have noticed lately that there is a light noise ( kind
of like a rough rotational noise) when the car is in neutral. When the
clutch pedal is depressed, the noise stops. I realize this is probably the
throw out bearing. I have adjusted the clutch several times and checked
the adjustment of the pedal stop in the floorwell, but the noise is still
there.
   4) Oh, and does anyone know where to find a reverse light switch. The
wires came out of their holes. I think the switch is shot anyway.
   5) My current tranny has the wierd ( at least to anyone else who has
tried to drive my car) shift pattern. You know, 1st gear is directly down
from reverse. Also, its a 5 speed. I am interested in changing all of the
shift bushings, but read somewhere that the engine and tranny have to be
removed. Is this true, or did someone say this just to see if I would fall
for it?
 Well thanks in advance for any help and advice you can give. I wish I
would have found this site a long time ago, it's great. If this thing gets
posted a million times, don't yell at me too much.
				Thanks Again,
			       Bryan Gilbreath
