I tried this again, and realized that I was only partly correct.  WinZIP
will work only if the file is MIME-encoded.  Unfortunately, the PorscheFans
digests are NOT.  When I did this, I was looking at a digest (same NTMail
list server software) that has a file attached.  THEIR mail client hadn't
encoded the mime so that MY mail client would recognize it, but WinZIP did.

I received a suggestion a few weeks ago from James J Dempsey (a P-Fan) that
the digests be formatted in RFC 1153 format. I've sent this suggestion on to
the folks at Internet Shopper (that's who makes NTMail).  He uses the MH
mail reader, but I don't anything about this.

In short, we're still looking for a mail client that separates messages. 
Probably won't happen unless Internet Shopper changes the format of the
digests.

Sorry about the mis-information with WinZIP.  I should've double-checked. 
So much for being infallable (ha!).
