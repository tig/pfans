Dear Peter, et al.

     It must be nice to be a Hitler-like list "leader" so  that when someone
replies to your  incorrect and just plain WRONG  ranting and ravings you can
just dump his file in the South 40.

    Clearly, you are a Control  & Power freak.

     Too bad you aren't into Truth.

      If others out there are dismayed by this blatent censorship and want to
gain REAL 356 info, there is no better place than the 356 Registry List!
           
 Long Live the 356 Registry List!

 To subscribe, just send an e-mail with only the word "subscribe" in the body

 It was only that long because of YOUR FLAMING! My responses were much
shorter than your raves.

  Right,. That's a good one Peter. Try something original next time,.

more >reasonable length, and on track. 

  Of course, this rule doesn''t apply to you!

not, >you've got one now. 

  I''ve known Editors. And you Peter are  no editor. You are  a CENSOR!

>You're welcome to stay if you keep to the point, and avoid making your posts
into >ads for "The Maestro." You're also welcome to leave if you can't do
that. 
 
   How about YOU stop making unjustified and just plain WRONG personal
attacks. Speaking of  your slanderous personal attacks, did  you  ever work
out an agreement with Tom Toldrian's lawyer for your slander of him and
"Excellence" magazine?
