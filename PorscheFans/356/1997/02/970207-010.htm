Pellow's blathering has been moved to the Flamers list. At nearly 8K, this
message is fully half as long as the rest of Wednesday's digests combined, in
which there were genuinely useful posts from several members on other topics.
We have a size limit, beyond which the server will reject a message, and in
our many months of operation, no other message (other than huge graphics
files) has ever come as close to it as this one. 

Pellow: the core of your message is nothing more than a blatant advertisement
for the stuff you are currently trying to push out the door, in this case
another batch of industrial engines. As such, I regard it as commercial
advertising and it doesn't belong on the PorscheFans 356 list. 

You can waste all the paper you want in your vanity-press books, you can pad
regional newsletters all you want, you can even take up pages in the Registry
with your personal, self-serving soapbox, but it ain't gonna happen on this
list.

In future, for postings on the main list, try to keep your ramblings to a
more reasonable length, and on track. You may not have an editor anywhere
else your drivel appears, but like it or not, you've got one now. You're
welcome to stay if you keep to the point, and avoid making your posts into
ads for "The Maestro." You're also welcome to leave if you can't do that. 

Lest you go off in a fit of paranoia, claiming I'm muzzling your creativity
or whatever, or your disciples start running off with cries of "Stone the
Listmaster! Stone the Listmaster!", you will please note that your shorter
postings were not moved to Flamers. That's how I expect you do conduct ALL of
your communications here -- to the point. I wouldn't want all those loyal
customers to be kept waiting while you compose 8K long (!!!) replies.

BTW, re spelling, if wer're going to fling typos at each other, (>>Too bad
you can't spell "STROGNLY"), check your own tagline. "Keep _Faithy_"? None of
your "Gentle Readers" spotted that? _You_ didn't spot that? Moral: People who
live in glass houses, shouldn't.
