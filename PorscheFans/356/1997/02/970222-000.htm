Greetings 356 fans:  

A 911 cousin needs some advise.  My boss has a couple of 356 engines
that were running fine in the early '80s and put on a shelf for later
tinkering.  Guess what, later never came.  Both engines are complete
including the starter, but missing the ignition wires and distributor
caps.  The boss says they are not Carrera engines or anything like that,
but doesn't know what they are or what they are worth.  The numbers on
the engine cases are P * 80131 * and P * 702963*.  Does anyone out there
know how to decipher these numbers or know where I could go to figure it
out myself?  Also, as a rebuildable core, does anyone know what a fair
value would be?  The boss is a sentamental fellow as most P-fans are and
would like to see these engines placed in a good home.  Would anyone be
interested in one or both?

Also....there's a transaxle complete with swing arms up to (but not
including) the brake assemblies.  It's so cruddy though that I can't
even find the numbers.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

TIA
