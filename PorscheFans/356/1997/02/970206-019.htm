Pete is certainly correct on this issue.

 Adding lead to fule is very wasteful and is irresponsible.

You have to go way back  (probably before WW-II) before you will find
valve seats so soft they will destruct with un-leaded fuel.

Tetraethyl lead generated tremendous cash flow for the Ethyl Corp. They
lobbied very hard against the EPA ban on leaded fuels. Much of the
mythology saying unleaded fuel is harmful to vintage cars is an echo of
Ethyl Corps.' misinformation campaign.

We can disagree on many issues reagrding environmental responsibility
and what the might or might not happen in 20 to 100 years from now. But
the scientific evidence that small amounts of lead is poisonous to human
beings is overwhelming and irrefutable. No reasonable person who knows
the published scientific literature would argue emitting lead, no matter
how small an amount (well ok, one billionth of an ounce just once
wouldn't hurt anything), into the atmosphere is acceptable.
