It sounds like you have a serious "blow-by" problem. That is, that too
much of the force of the explosion in the combustion chambers is getting
past the rings, and into the crankcase. The oil is being expelled through
any opening it can find, ie. the dipstick hole. Do a compression test. I
think that you will find that the readings will be low.  At a minimum,
you will need to replace the rings. If the grooves in the pistons are
worn, the pistons will have to be replaced, as well. Wear in the groove
is measured by putting a new ring in the groove, and using a feeler
gauge to measure the clearance between the top of the groove and the
piston ring. Anything over .005 inches is too much. Let us know what you
find out.......
