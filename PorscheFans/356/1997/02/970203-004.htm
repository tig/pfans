     I figured that this group doesn't have enough postings, heck with all 
     the lively discussions on the 911 group (from speeding tickets to 
     bastard 912s) why doesn't this group get a little of its own smack 
     flying?
     
     So why is it that in the movies you only see the ladies driving 356s 
     (yaa, I know, some A.R. type is going to write back with a list of 
     every movie ever made with a 356 in it and give me the percentage of 
     male to female drivers...)?  Is this the image that this vehicle 
     portrays?  I brought my last girlfriend to a Porsche swap meet and she 
     fell in love with the 356 cabs right away.... 
     
     In best Tim the Toolman voice: "Hugh, hugh, must leave 911 to man.  
     Power, speed, flat six, hugh, hugh."  
     
     Doesn't the 356 come off just a little more "sophisticated" (at least 
     to the "general viewing audience")?
