Hi Pete,

I guess if this is your party you can invite whoever you want, but I gotta
say that your original criticism and this recent response is more
out-of-line with respect to content and tone than Harry's supposed
advertisements/ramblings have ever been, when compared to several other
administered lists to which I belong. 

I suggest that you either back up your allegations with facts, a majority
opinion, or realize that you just have a personal problem with Harry and
administer the list independent of your personal feelings. 

I realize that your response was couched in the "8K message size limit"
format, and I don't have a problem with that aspect.

I have only been around for about six months and have appreciated Harry's
input. It has been helpful to me in several instances. Sure he's somewhat
eccentric and colorful, but our diversities can be accommodated and make
life interesting. Shucks, I even like his colorful, humorous approach.

Thanks for providing this forum for we Porsche owners and fanatics!
