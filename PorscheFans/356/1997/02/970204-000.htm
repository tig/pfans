>>This is one point on which Harry and I disagree.

That's OK, there are a lot of things where a lot of knowledgeable Porsche
people STROGNLY disagree with the self-appointed (and unedited,
un-peer-reviewed, damn near unreadable) Maestro.

(Bob's story of plug fouling due to oil squirters deleted; Bob then says:)

>>Take my advice: leave those holes closed.  Once mine were brazed shut, the
engine became as docile as a lamb, but there was absolutely no effect on
engine longevity. Mine finally succumbed to a broken ring at about 90,000
miles (and most of those were high-rpm miles).  The valve guides showed no
unusual wear.  After a Stoddard rebuild, it now idles easily at 350 rpm...and
I can't remember the last time I had to clean a spark plug, particularly
since unleaded gas became the norm.

>>Harry's probably right about the percentage of dealers who followed
Porsche's
technical service bulletin and brazed up the oil holes.  Mine only
volunteered the
information after hearing my complaint of constant plug-fouling.

How does Seinfeld suddenly rate as an authority on these cars? Is this who
Pellow uses for approbation, or is it just name dropping? Seinfeld is as much
a technical authority as Tim Allen is a building contractor. Owning many
Porsches makes one an authority on spending money, not necessarily
engineering. Letting Pellow talk somebody into putting the wrong engine into
an otherwise original and highly desirable car raises some questions; ripping
out the original interior of an unrestored 550 because you don't like the
color raises even more. My understanding is that the Speedster had the
ORIGINAL engine when it went to Pellow. Pellow replaced it with an engine
that seriously devalues the car. Who is really being served here, the
customer or the salesman?

Put it this way: who do you think has a better handle on how these things are
supposed to be set up, the engineers and mechanics in the Porsche engineering
and service staffs or some gnome in San Jose? Pellow once bought a bunch of
military surplus industrial engines and then had to find a way to justify to
his customers how these things were somehow "better" than the ordinary
engines which all those other people (who didn't have the secret Pellow
connection) had in their cars.

Porsche put the holes in there for breakin at a time when it was felt that
this area needed the lubrication early in the engine's life, and a time when
oil didn't work nearly as well as modern oil does. They specifically told
dealers to plug the holes because it was also felt that this area should NOT
get extra oil during its normal life. Furthermore, having these extra holes
draining from the oil pressure system means that less oil is available for
the bearings. Not much, but some. Perhaps that's why they wanted these to be
open during breakin only, when revs and loads were (hopefully) lower. In
those days engines were more sensitive to breakin than modern designs, which
really don't need much at all, and drivers were more likely to adhere to the
breakin instructions. Once the car came in for its first service, the shop
plugged the holes and said it was OK to go for it, they drove the cars
differently.

Bottom line, Steve, leave 'em plugged.

Got a Porsche problem? Use the factory manual, use your own head, don't just
follow the turkeys. Chances are, they only want to sell you something.
