This is one point on which Harry and I disagree.

As the original owner of a '65 SC, I lived through the era of open oil holes in exhaust
rockers...along with my trusty spark plug wrench.  While open oil holes may be
perfectly acceptable on industrial engines (which ordinarily sit and run constantly at
a fixed, high rpm...probably somewhere near the torque peak), they can make your
life miserable in an automobile engine!  This is the design feature that begat the
phrase "Italian Tune-up", I'm sure.  Until the dealer took pity on me and brazed the oil
holes shut, my routine was to wrap the engine out to 6000 rpm straight from the
driveway, to ensure that the plugs were clean.  The same technique was required when
leaving each stoplight, or at any other time I was forced to idle for more than a few
seconds.  And, even with this, I could count on a half-hour each Saturday morning
wrenching and cleaning spark plugs.

Take my advice: leave those holes closed.  Once mine were brazed shut, the engine
became as docile as a lamb, but there was absolutely no effect on engine longevity.
Mine finally succumbed to a broken ring at about 90,000 miles (and most of those
were high-rpm miles).  The valve guides showed no unusual wear.  After a Stoddard
rebuild, it now idles easily at 350 rpm...and I can't remember the last time I had to
clean a spark plug, particularly since unleaded gas became the norm.

Harry's probably right about the percentage of dealers who followed Porsche's
technical service bulletin and brazed up the oil holes.  Mine only volunteered the
information after hearing my complaint of constant plug-fouling.
