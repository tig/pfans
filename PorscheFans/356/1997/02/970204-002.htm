thanks Robert for your input on my question as to  opening up the oil
squirter holes. Even though I have closed the 'A' valve cover screen
openings, I don't have any oil loss anywhere that I know of. I don't rev the
engine that high, 5,000RPM max. I also have the new type of valve cover
gaskets from Vic Skirmants, and they work great. I have 40mm Webers with K&N
filters, so if I ever need to open up the covers, I'll look into the ones
with ball valves. Would also like to say I got my industrial engine from Gene
Berg, the VW guy in Calif. I did get the Webers, manifolds, valve springs,
from Harry Pellow, though. I still have my original engine, with Zeniths,
which I will keep with the car. So, if I ever sell it, it can be put back to
original(if wanted). One thing, I thought the industrials were run at a lower
RPM. Because the valve springs had to be changed to regular ones.
