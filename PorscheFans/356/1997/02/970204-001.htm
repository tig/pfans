A few years ago I rescued a '65 SC Coupe that had been sitting for 15+
years.  After cleaning & rebuilding everything BUT the engine, I gambled the
engine would run, since there were only 49,000 original miles on it.  It
DID! HOWEVER, the heads had been loose, and we had to do a valve job & fly
cut them, but the rings looked fine, so the mechanic doing the work told me
he didn't think we'd have to do more.  Well, I leak oil.  Out of the
dipstick hole.  And I mean a considerable amount, making the engine
compartment a mess, and making using the heater a questionable practice.
Except for that the engine runs fine, maybe with slightly less than maximum
power, but it gets out of it's own way OK, and gets good mileage.  I've
since had ANOTHER mechanic tell me that the rings probably lost their
tension while sitting so long, and that I probably only need rings. Any
comments from someone knowledgable would be of interest. Recommendations??
I'm really tired of the oil mess, but have limited funds to spend.

Mark
