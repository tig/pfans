Dear Pete:

        Good to hear from you again. Such  a long  time. My comments follow:

In a message dated 97-02-04 14:46:37 EST, you write:

   Too bad you can't spell "STROGNLY". Thanks  to hundreds, nay  THOUSANDS of
Gentle Reader  who wrote in about my Books, "The ABC's of Porsche Engines",
each edition became better and better. 
    I have just  finished scanning  all 700 pages of  "The ABC's" into  the
Pentium, and NOW IS THE TIME to REPORT ANY ERRORS YOU (or anybody else)
FOUND! So  that  they might be argued over and,  if need be, corrected. After
all, that  was the whole point of writing the Books in the first place- to
Find The Truth. If you have any truth to submit, please do. I'll even give
credit. Or not. Your choice. Such a deal.

     You Betcha!

    No, it's True! Jerry wanted to DRIVE the car, as it was and still is his
favoritre car! (Now even more so.)

    Your understanding is completely WRONG!
   Jerry's Speedster did NOT have the Original Engine. It had a Heinz 57
engine, with Gross Mismatches. Thanks to the  Engine Data Base that now has
some 5,000 Engine Numbers, Date Stamps and the all-important Case Casting
Number it was easily determined that Jerry's engine had a pair of
 Main Case Halves made in  1959. The Third Piece  of Jerry's Case was from a
mid-1957.   And the  Speedster was  a 1958. Yes, it averages out to 1958, but
you can't do it that way. 
     You  surely wouldn' t know this, but the 1957 Third Piece used an
External Oil Booster Line that ran from the Oil Bypass Valve up past  the
fuel pump on the OUTSIDE of the Third Piece,  to  the Junction Block to
supply oil pressure to  the valve. But 1959 Main Case Halves are drilled  to
use an INTERNAL "oil booster line" that  fits INSIDE the Third Piece of the
1959 Engine. 
   Ergo, there was NO Oil Booster Line hooked up AT ALL! on Jerry's Engne!
Which may be part of the reason  why this mismatched pile of parts posing as
a Porsche engine had all of 16 PSI oil pressure. (Of course,  that  was AFTER
it had lost a fan belt 47 miles after being rebuilt by a Dealer in La La
Land. And Jerry didn't stop until BOTH lights came on on the dash.)
   The Second Under 356A crank needed to go  to Third Under. Not a nice
choice. The 356A rods had to be replaced- always-  there's no choice there.
The Original 356A Normal cam provokes no excitement. The 356A  Normal Cast
Iron Cam  Followers that break their heads off and destroy engines had to be
replaced by Ate 21411, 3000 or 3900 Steel Cam  Followers. Likewise the
MisMatched Case with LOTSA welded areas on the bottom was almost 2  thou out
and needed an align bore and  WASN'T THE ORIGINAL  ENGINE ANYWAY.
   Oh, and let us not forget  the severely flycut 356A heads still with  the
Brass Seats inside.
    And how about a New First- a fairly new Big Bore Kit with THREE different
kinds of Oil Control Rings! Wonder how/why that happened. This rebuild, you
may recall, was done by a DEALER!

    How about a Chem E. from M.I.T.? Could he maybe find a few Factory
Boo-Boos, 
as listed in The Books- like the Errors in the Factory Manual. Or  the Errors
in the listing of Engine/Chassis numbers that many take for Gospel?

  And, you're    WRONG AGAIN Peter.  I'm not in San Jose!

   I did not once buy a bunch of Porsche Industrial  Engines- I bought
SEVERAL BUNCHES!  In fact, I 'm buying a few MORE  PORSCHE INDUSTRIAL
 ENGINES from Europe- they're supposedly the Last of the Batch.
 
   And I don't have  to "justify" these  engines to my Customers- they only
have to LOOK at the parts! 
   Most of the Porsche Industrial Engines were used by the Luftwaffe for
APU's for the F-104 jets, idling on  the Flight Line in case the Bear from
the East attacked. 
  Porsche Industrial  Engines were made until 1973-  that's FOUR YEARS AFTER
THE LAST 912 WAS MADE! (Which, of course, means that the LAST of the 356/912
engines was an Industrial! Put that in your Tech Quiz and smoke it.)

 But  the Real Exciting part about  Porsche Industrial Engines made from 1964
to 1973 is  that  they have  these WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, VIRGIN parts inside!
Those made from 1964 to 1973 have either 356C/912 or, sometimes,  the
Wonderful 356SC Blackened Cylinder Heads.

They come with STD X STD 356C cranks that never need grinding.
They  come with the nicest Case you've ever Measured!
And oh,  those Virgin 912 Rods.
And  that Virgin 912 Valve train- with EVERY EXHAUST ROCKER HAVING AN OPEN
OIL SQUIRTER HOLE. (Hey- if it's good  enough to defend your country from
Nuclear Attack, it's good enough for me! KEEP THOSE OIL HOLES OPEN!)
Even the Cad Plate looks good- it should it was well protected for almost 30
years!
   Certainly you must overhaul the Industrials, as  they have weak VW valve
springs, 356C non-Sodium exhaust valves,  the Cast Iron Cam Followers and the
fllat-topped, low compression  85.5mm Industrial Big Bore Kit.
  Some of these engines have only a couple of hundred hours on  them- usually
at less than 15 horsepower, and were NEVER RUN ABOVE 3600 RPM!
  Porsche Industrial Engines make the best basis for a race engine or a GREAT
street engine,  as long as you don't care about the Industrial Engine Number.
   Should you (or Jerry or anybody else) want the original type engine, I'll
be happy  to build just that, but not  with "A" rods, nor "A" Cast Iron Cam
Followers nor Brass Intake  Seats.
   Jerry chose the numerous advantages of a late-model Case, Crank, Heads,
 Rockers, etc. from a really nice 48 million series Industrial made in 1973.
With a special conversion we do on a 200mm Porsche flywheel so  it will mate
with  a Speedster's  VW style Throw-out bearing, his car is a joy to drive.
 I know, I've driven it.

  With the non-Original mismash that was there before, Jerry was afraid to go
on  the Freeway. Now he has No Fear.


Keep the 356 Faith!
The Maestro
