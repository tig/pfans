When I posted asking for personal experiences with Webers and Solexes, I
specifically said that people who sell these things commercially should stay
out of it. As usual, Pellow didn't, or didn't want to, comprehend that.
(Pellow is the one who pushes Webers the hardest, and (surprise) just happens
to sell the things.)

Responses on the list from people who DON'T have something to sell runs about
2 or 3:1 against the Webers, in favor of the Solexes.

>>Having personally installed & adjusted HUNDREDS of carburetors
of all the above types on 356/912's, I think you might like to hear the
results.

Installed hundreds because he sold hundreds. How many Solexes has he sold?
Not hundreds, because he would have to do some serious legwork to find that
many. 

>>A good carburetor is a good carburetor, and Webers are good carburetors.

Maybe on a Fiat. Or a four-cam that is supposed to have them. Not those
aftermarket one-carb-fits-all applications. I have worked with Weber as a
professional engineer, on Porsche-designed original equipment applications,
and they're a good company, but these carbs are not the best solution for the
356 engine. Anybody who calls himself a maestro and pushes Webers should
perhaps confine his fiddling to Alfa Romeos and Fiats.

>>It's more a matter of personal choice- like do you want to be 
Original, or do you want Ball Bearings supporting your throttle shaft?

Who cares? If it works fine without ball bearings, and most of the
carburetors still breathing on this planet do work without ball bearings,
what difference does it make? By this point, the Solexes have lasted 30 plus
years. There's no reason to think that they won't go another 30 with a
rebuild, especially since most of us don't drive our cars more than a few
thousand miles a year.

>>I like both the 40 and 44IDF- which one you
select depends on the application. The 40's are a good choice for a 
street engine, they're more tractable around town and give better gas
mileage. 

That's because they flow less air, so they need less gas, but then you have
less power. My point exactly. I can design you a Porsche engine that will
pull like Jack the bear from idle rpm. All I need is a teeny tiny carb with
an even smaller manifold runner. It will be all over by 3000 rpm though.

>>The 44's produce more high-end power (at the cost of low-end
driveability) and give you the sound of the Ferrari at less than 1% of the
cost.

Buying an audio tape would be cheaper still, if that's what you need. And
then you could have any sort of drivability you want.

>>The 40's, having a 40mm bore are best used with the Solex manifold and
the Adapto-plate. (This also eliminates interference with the sheet metal
and spring plate bolts on late-model fan shrouds.) The 44's, having a 44mm
bore, should be used with the Weber manifold as it too has a 44mm bore and
things then match. The Weber manifold, however, requires some triming of the
Side Vertical shrouds to provide clearance. (Also, if you use the Weber
manifold on late-model Fan Shrouds, then you should watch out for
interference

In other words, the 40s use less gas because they flow less air and therefore
make less power than stock Solexes. But if you want to fix that, you need
44s, which "requires some trimming of the side vertical shrouds" and "watch
out for
interference between bolts holding the spring plate on the fan shroud and the
screws holding the block-off plate on the Weber." Oh, I get it now. In other
words you get to hack up your car. Wonderful advice from a hacker.

>>With Solexes, changing a main jet means that the entire 
contents of the float bowl pours out all over your nice sheet metal
With Webers, the Main Jet, Air Correction Jet and Emulsion Tube are
all in a "Jet Stack" in the middle of the carb, and any one or
all three can be changed in 30 seconds, using a dime or a screwdriver,
withOUT having the entire contents of the float chamber flowing all over
your spark plug wires.

With the correct carbs, you don't need to do any of this. You rebuild the
Solexes, put the factory jets in, and never touch those jets again. I have
driven my car for six years and 90K miles without ever rejetting the thing.
And yes, that includes the transition to "reformulated gas." With Webers,
you'll spend days trying to fix the jetting to work right, then finally give
up, settle for what you've got, and convince yourself and your friends that
now, boy, you're really making the power; must be, after all it sounds like a
Ferrari. After a while, you won't remember how the car ran before, and
everything will seem fine now. And it's amazing how a more aggressive exhaust
note will convince you of that. Another of the joys of worshipping at The
Church of the Maestro (which has its own messiah, its own Bible in three
volumes, its own disciples and even its own Faith, which must be kept and
defended against all infidels).

>>[To] rebuild the Solexes, which to do properly, costs almost as much as a
set of NEW Webers!

Exactly. So if your Solexes don't need rebuilding, there is no need to buy
Webers anyway. And if they DO need rebuilding, there are competent shops who
will do it for less than the cost of the Weber kludge. Or you can spend more
for Webers, hope you can get them to work, and later convince yourself that
you were successful.
