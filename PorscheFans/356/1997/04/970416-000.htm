Hi Pete, everyone interested,
	I have to disagree with you about dissatisfaction with Webers.
I have a pair on my 69 912 and they are excellent! As for not being able
to give jet numbers, well: 40 idles, 110 mains, f11 emulsion tubes, and
200 airs seem to make my car run excellent. Depending on the condition of
your motor, these #'s will vary.... But Webers do enable you
easily(spelling is not one of my favorite tings...) change things...
As for fit, I had no problem getting linkages, hoses, manifolds to work.
Don't get me wrong, I like the solexes too, but they were made without
longevity in mind. No bushings in the main housing? It's gotta wear out...
So just another short$.02.

Comments, flames.... Oh well....
