Having owned 912s and used both Solex and Weber carbs, I vote for
Solex.  Here's why:

My '66 912 w/4-speed had tired Solex carbs and 1750 pistons/cylinders
when I bought it.  I put Weber 40s, K&N filters and a manifold adaptor
on the car.  It was quicker, and suddenly I could hit 60mph in second
gear no problem!

My '68 912 Targa came with with a Weber kit already installed.  When
Pete Zimmerman (Redline Service, Santa Monica) rebuilt my engine several
years ago, he convinced me to put the car back stock, used original
Mahles, and found me a pair of brand new Solexes.  Since then, the
Solexes have given me many trouble-free miles of use, and I have no
regrets about taking Pete's advice.

If the Porsche factory had found Webers were better for 912 motors, they
could have put them on as original equipment.  (For example, Webers were
used on some early 911's.)  And in terms of collector car value, Solexes
are the way to go.

Want Webers on your Porsche?  I suggest getting an early 911 that had
them original equipment.

Cheers,
Rick Becker
