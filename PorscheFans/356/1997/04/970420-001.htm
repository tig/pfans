Finally, a question on this list I know something about.
Firstly, lets talk about the areas which I believe impact the structural
integrity of the vehicle,
You made mention of the pan having been replaced, about six months ago a
poster to the 911 list made mention of the ice-pick test. I'd encourage you
to get way under this car and start probing where the new pan meets the old
Porsche. Especially if the whole repair is covered with heavy underbody
coating (which some persons use to mask a faulty repair).
The front end, I don't think the 30 year old Porsches are as bad as the
Karmen Ghias in this respect but, most everything that controls the direction
the car is traveling gets mounted to a piece of sheet metal which forms the
chassis. Wheels off, we're looking at places where mud gets flung up and
caked (weld crevasses, rubber bushing mounting plates, rubber grommet
holes...) look very hard poke and scratch at anything that looks suspicious.
If the cars owner doesn't like you picking and scratching, move on down the
road, front end failure is way bad.
The back end, less vulnerable than the front but, still worth looking into.
Wheels off, you're poking your head and light way up kinda behind the wheel
wells and try to get a look at the strut mounts. While your down there see if
you can find the spot where the previous owner has been jacking up the car.
Much damage can be done by careless jacking. I think I've heard them referred
to as "torsion tubes", lets look there too (it's the little tube that's just
forward of the wheel and protruding from the back wall of the wheel well.
I've never seen any serious rust damage to this area but, many people place
the jack stand here and it needs to be done more carefully that most people
do. Is it bent, mauled...
The rocker panel areas you mentioned are more structural than most people
imagine. You refer to it as "rocker tube" so you're thinking along the right
lines. That formed tube is one of the main members that's keeping the car
from twisting, sagging, and more or less folding in half. Aside from more of
the old icepick treatment I don't know of a good way to check this area. I do
know that some bodyshops and undercoating shops have thought this a good area
for filling with expanding foam insulation. BAD IDEA (I believe the Fiat
Strada had foam filling). This traps moisture (in fact modern foam is a
moisture cured foam which off-gasses steam) inside the tube.
On to the more cosmetic areas.
Up front, just below the headlight is that little horn grill, there's
supposed to be a piece of the fender below the horn grill and the turnlamp
housing (my TWEEKS catalog is calling it the turn signal box but, I don't
think that's right), lots of mud and stuff gets packed in this little spot
and that metal rusts away to nothing there's an almost identicle area under
the rear tunr lamps. Its not a major deal but, it can impact the fender line.
Headlight buckets are usually a little rusty and dusty, no rust through
please.
The front bumper is just a festival of rust vulnerability. The top edge, the
holes for bumperette mounting, foglamp cutouts, under the deco strip...
Front fenders are prone to rust at the rear mostly where the fender joining
panel meets the fender and up top where the pointy corner meets the cowel
piece meets the windscreen frame. If the seam gasket has failed (or the
windscreen gasket) this area can get really nasty. All around the windscreen
frame can get bubbly if the windscreen gasket fails.
Up on the roof I have no direct experience with the Targa roof. The coupe
however, not usually rusty but, a ladder falling in a garage always tries its
very hardest to hit the roof of an old Porsche. Look for dings or sloppy dent
repair.
Doors. If the weather stripping has failed much water gets inside the doors.
The lower edge of the doors suffers for this. Also there is a door
crossmember about 3" up from the bottom edge which invites rust. The hinge
area isn't all that bad usually.
Just behind the door strike plates can get pretty soft. And the little divot
for the rear lid latch handle.
Rear lid and cowel are a bit vulnerable if the weep holes get plugged. Check
the bottom edge of the lid.
I've surely left out some obvious spot but, this is the stuff I've seen in my
car shopping.
I wouldn't consider a car with serious front end rust, just scares me too
bad. The rest of this stuff is very repairable (not inexpensive).
I had the front of my 1969 912 cleaned up last summer. Fenders patched and
sandblasted, windscreen frame repaired, Rockers refurbed, Bumper and hood
sandblasted and straitened... $4,600 It looks fabulous.
Hope this info helps.

On another note: My 912 has Dell'Orto carbs and I think they are the best.
