Hi.  We've got a 356 which is suffering that which most 356's suffer:
rust.  The floor pan now offers a unique view of the road surface.  The
mechanicals on this vehicle run fine, and it's a great ride, but I can't
feel comfortable anymore, worrying about when a seat might plummet through
the floor.  Can any of you recommend a shop in the SF Bay Area who might be
willing (and capable) to replace the floor pan?  This would be the first
step toward restoration of this fine vehicle.
  We've had a heck of a time finding anyone willing to work on this
vehicle.  It seems most folks only want to work on 911's.
  Any ideas?  I stopped a guy at a gas station recently, and he recommended
somebody called "Cecil Beach" in San Jose, but I can't find any such
listing.  Your recommendations will be appreciated.

Thanks,

David Alfano
