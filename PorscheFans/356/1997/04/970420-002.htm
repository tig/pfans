Pete, it is obvious, from the recent message response, and others in the
past, that you don't like Harry Pellow. I, personally, made the decision to
rebuild the Solex carbs on my 912, and would do so on my SC also, if/when
needed.  However, I thought Harry's input on the carbs was NOT a commercial.
I thought he presented positive information regarding BOTH systems, and it
is up to the readership to then use their brains to decide what they wish to
do with their cars, depending on individual needs.  My decision was based on
identical cost and the sheet metal problem with the Webers:  why spend the
same money and have to do extra work?  Never mind the "original" arguement.
I CAN see a scenario where Webers might be a better solution, though:  if
one DOES need to change jets often, in racing situations, for example, it
might be beneficial to use the Webers. I enjoy reading Harry's responses,
and two weeks ago he gave me information, in response to someone else's
problem on the Registry list, that allowed me to solve a problem that had
gone unsolved for over three years, despite input from subscribers on your
list and several local mechanics.  Harry does like to toot his own horn, and
some don't like his colorful prose, but he does have a lot of
experience--and opinions-- and I like hearing from various viewpoints.
We're supposed to be adults, and have the capacity--I hope--to sift through
accumulated information and come to our own conclusions.
