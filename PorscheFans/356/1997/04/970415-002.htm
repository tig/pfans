Jeff Taylor asks

<< Who out there rebuilds Solex 40P11-4 carbs.  The lower halfs
 of mine are worn and are allowing too much air past the 
 throttle at idle.
 
 Is it cost effective to rebuild the carbs, or would replacing
 them with Webers be better?  Which carburetor has the better
 performance?

Hi, Jeff.

Rebuild the Solexes. There are a lot of people out there offering Weber
conversion kits because you can't get Solexes anymore, and they can't make
any money on selling rebuilts (have to hunt down cores, send them out, pay
somebody else to rebuild them, then mark them up again, too little profit by
that point) but they can make money on buying new Webers at wholesale and
selling them at retail. So these people have been going around for years,
spreading the myth that Webers are somehow better than Solexes. Batpuckey.

I just got back from a trip to the factory three weeks ago. One of the old
hands who used to be in the racing department is now heavily involved with
the older cars that come through the repair shop. We got to talking and he
said "We get a lot of customer cars here that were bought in the U.S. and
brought back. Why do you people insist on buggering up the cars?" I guessed
right off: "You mean Webers?" "Yeah, Webers. Why do you do that?" I told him
that this whole thing was propagated by a self-appointed expert in the Bay
Area who claims to have all the answers. And if you don't believe him, you
can look it up in his books, there's the proof right there.

I have never seen a Weber installation that works worth a damn. The throttle
linkage is wrong. The jets are wrong and while you can fiddle with them, it
will take you a long time to get it right. (None of the experts ever tell you
what jets you need). The carbs don't even fit right, you have to do all sorts
of workarounds to attach them. The "experts" will claim they make more power.
They can't, not with the smaller bores. 

The factory still knows best.

Bottom line, send your Solexes to the best rebuilding shop for these things
-- Eurometrix. It's not cheap but neither is a new set of Webers, and then
you don't have the aggravation of needing to do your own engineering on the
things. 

My Solexes were redone by Eurometrix. They now have about 90K miles on them
and still work fine in my daily driver.
