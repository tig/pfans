Subject: Weber/Solex/Zenith Carbs on a 356/912

        Recently, there has been a discussion here concerning the use of
Weber Carburetors vs. Solex/Zenith carbs on a 356 or 912 Porsche.
        Having personally installed & adjusted HUNDREDS of carburetors
of all the above types on 356/912's, I think you might like to hear the
results.
        Result 1: IF Zenith or Solex Carbs have been rebuilt properly-
with all surfaces machined flat, the bodies ultrasonically cleaned and
in the case of Solexes, bronze throttle shafts bushings installed
(along with oversize butterflies, if needed), then they work well!
        Result 2: The 40 IDF Webers (and even the 44IDF Webers),
work well on 356's or 912 too! Don't let others steer you toward a wrong
decision with their personal prejedices and half-truths. A good carburetor 
is a good carburetor, and Webers are good carburetors.
        It's more a matter of personal choice- ike do you want to be 
Original, or do you want Ball Bearings supporting your throttle shaft?
   As far as Weber carburetors, I like both the 40 and 44IDF- which one you
select depends on the application. The 40's are a good choice for a 
street engine, they're more tractable around town and give better gas
mileage. 
     The 44's produce more high-end power (at the cost of low-end
driveability)
and give you the sound of the Ferrari at less than 1% of the cost.
     The 40's, having a 40mm bore are best used with the Solex manifold and
the Adapto-plate. (This also eliminates interference with the sheet metal
and spring plate bolts on late-model fan shrouds.) The 44's, having a 44mm
bore, should be used with the Weber manifold as it too has a 44mm bore and
things then match. The Weber manifold, however, requires some triming of the
Side Vertical shrouds to provide clearance. (Also, if you use the Weber
manifold on late-model Fan Shrouds, then you should watch out for
interference
between bolts holding the Spring Plate on the Fan Shroud and the
screws holding the block-off plate on the Weber.)
     The biggest problem with Solexes is that the steel throttle shaft wears
its bore in the carburetor body (there being no bushings in the
early Solexes). Eventually, the wear gets so bad that the butterflies
start digging into the throttle body, opening up gaps around the butterfly,
allowing more air than necessary to pass through. This causes the high RPM
idle condition characteristic of worn Solexes. Adjusting the mixture screws
either has little or no effect or makes things worse. It's time to rebuild
the Solexes, which to do properly, costs almost as much as a set of NEW
Webers!
     Webers don't NEED the throttle shaft bore rebored or rebushed
since Webers have ball bearings supporting the throttle shaft and do not
suffer from throttle shaft wear like the Solexes do. THAT'S a big advantage.
     With Solexes, changing a main jet means that the entire 
contents of the float bowl pours out all over your nice sheet metal
With Webers, the Main Jet, Air Correction Jet and Emulsion Tube are
all in a "Jet Stack" in the middle of the carb, and any one or
all three can be changed in 30 seconds, using a dime or a screwdriver,
withOUT having the entire contents of the float chamber flowing all over
your spark plug wires.
       Having the Main Jet, Air Correction Jet and Emulsion Tube
on a single, easily-removed Jet Stack is a Better Idea.
      The big disadvantage of Webers is that they are not Original. If you
want only original parts on your car, you're stuck with Solexes or Zeniths.
      Speaking of Zeniths- though not a "performance" carburetor, when 
properly rebuilt they run Very Well, thank you. (I just fired up a rebuilt
356C today- and it's a joy to adjust the idle mixture  screws- they're
like micrometers and repeatable. A sign of a good carburetor.)
      Just my $.02.

KEEP THE 356/912 FAITH!
