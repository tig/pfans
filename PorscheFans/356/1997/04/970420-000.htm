Dear Peter, et al:

     Ah, I just love a friendly, non-threatening discussion. 

     A few corrections on your misdirected polemic:


In a message dated 97-04-19 13:39:18 EDT, you write:

<< 
> When I posted asking for personal experiences with Webers and Solexes, I
> specifically said that people who sell these things commercially should

 >(Pellow is the one who pushes Webers the hardest, and (surprise) just

   No Pete, I explain to Customers the pros and cons of BOTH Solexes (and
Zeniths) as well as Webers, and let him make the choice. We rebuild ALL types
of Solexes, Zeniths or Webers, and have New Weber kits in stock. The Customer
decides what he wants.
 
  
 >>Having personally installed & adjusted HUNDREDS of carburetors

 >Installed hundreds because he sold hundreds. How many Solexes has he sold?

    That's right, Pete, I HAVE done some "serious legwork" over the past 25
years. That's why I was able to install HUNDREDS of Solexes, Zeniths AND
Webers!
You oughta try it sometime. Build a few hundred engines. Maybe then you'll
know.




 >>A good carburetor is a good carburetor, and Webers are good carburetors.
 
>Maybe on a Fiat. Or a four-cam that is supposed to have them. 

    Glad you added the 4- Cam Carrera as a Weber-user before you condemned
ALL Webers on Porsches. By the way, you forgot that the 911 used Webers too.
And that there used to be a set of Webers that LEGALLY REPLACED mechanical
fuel injection on early 911's. Remember?

 > Anybody who calls himself a maestro and pushes Webers should
 >perhaps confine his fiddling to Alfa Romeos and Fiats.
 
    Not a chance.

> Who cares? If it works fine without ball bearings, and most of the

     Therefore,  100-year-olds should live another hundred years? Or I should
feel safer on a 30-year old airliner 'cause it'll clearly go another  30
years? Face it- Most all 30-year old Solexes need  throttle shaft
repair/rebushing , not just  gasket replacement.

    Peter, both the 40 and 44IDF Webers can take venturis from 28mm to 36mm.
Solexes have 32 mm venturis. Ergo, clearly the Webers can bracket the Solex
any which way. Webers are DESIGNED to have their jets/emulsion tubes changed
easily, unlike Solexes. And those Ball Bearings DO make a difference- ever
hear of a Weber having the "worn throttle shaft" problem? There are many
happy owners driving around with Webers. Don't knock it until you've tried
it.
 
Keep the 356 Faith!
The Maestro
