Hello,

I recently happened upon a 64' 356C as a "gift" from my uncle.  The 
car has a high degree of rust, surprise!  The problem is that my uncle 
lives in Maryland and it would be equally difficult to return the car as 
it would be to tell him that I parted it out.  Thus, I am entering the 
world of over-investment in an older Porsche.  I have a reasonable 
amount of mechanical and body work experience (no expertise).  The car 
is very rusted underneath and is even difficult to jack up.  I have some 
of the factory sheet metal and can purchase the rest.  It would be very 
helpful to get some "positive" feedback and some recommended shops or 
people who do good quality cutting/welding work on the side.  I would 
appreciate any feedback.

Thanks,

Greg Gularte
