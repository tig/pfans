Glad it worked for you. The 912 has lots more space in the engine room than a
356; it was designed for 2 more cylinders. So you don't have to kludge things
as much to physically get the Webers in there under the lid. 

Webers have other idiosyncracies, like in the transition region. And like I
said they usually have smaller throats than the Solexes, which means lower
air flow and less power. You may shift the torque curve to the bottom end as
a result, so often customers subjectively interpret this as "better pick-up"
although a side-by-side test will show that the car is actually slower across
the board. 

If you DO put in bigger venturis, to at least get the same airflow, then the
throat-to-throttle ratio is considerably less favorable than on the Solexes.
Think of this as signal to noise ratio for the vacuum signal that the jets
get in order to meter fuel.

Bottom line, the Weber is a one-size-fits-all kit solution, not a factory
engineered system.

No flames. Like I said, glad it worked for you but in my experience, most
others aren't so lucky.

As for bushings wearing out, OK, given enough time, I suppose they do. But
I've got 6 years and 90K miles on the last overhaul done by Eurometrix, and
they're still running fine. If you look at the cost of a decent rebuild, and
the cost (and aggravation) of do-it-yourself engineering with Webers, it
works out to about the same.

Anybody else want to mention their experiences, pro or con, on the Webers vs
Solex (those selling either carbs commercially need not apply... and I don't
have a financial stake in this, I don't have any spare Solexes anyway).
