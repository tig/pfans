Hi, Charlie.

<< With all due respect to you, I hardly see how you have any place to
exclude
 someone from this discussion........ 

With due respect to yourself, likewise... A few words of explanation. This
probably isn't common knowledge because it isn't on the web page or in the
headers. But, well, uh, see, I started this list. I adminster the list. Such
little administration as it gets. When the server even runs, which isn't as
often as I'd like these days. I also do the other sections of PorscheFans. On
one rare occasion I threw people off (the 911 list). I even add people when
they don't know how to do it themselves. And I won't let this particular 356
list degenerate into an electronic soapbox for a couple of self-aggrandizing
egomaniacs. They can keep it over there on that other list.

My job is that of an editor. In this case, I'm trying to keep the editorial
content, which is generated by the list readers themselves, free of
commercial interests. Individuals selling the occasional part or car are OK
and very welcome. Commercial entities plugging their business, and in the
process disseminating negative information about competing products (i.e. new
Webers vs. rebuilt Solexes) are not OK and do not serve the interests of the
356 community. It is a clear conflict of interest. You wouldn't expect to
pick up a copy of Consumer Reports and find a comparison test of a Camaro and
Musting written by a GM marketing executive. In the same way, you shouldn't
expect to pick up a 356 magazine (or mail list) and find a column or posts
from a business putting down other businesses or competing products in favor
of those products which it just so happens to have on the shelf. Out of the
2000 or so members of the combined PorscheFans lists, I can't think of any
other commercial entity that does this.

My comment about people who sell carburetors commercially need not enter the
discussion was specifically posted because Pellow likes to take every
opportunity to plug his business. I hoped he would stay out of it this time
but he isn't capable of that, and his response came as no surprise. Everybody
else on this list seems to be in it on the consumer side; he's in it on the
commercial side. Infomercials are not welcome and have no business on this
list. 

Pete
