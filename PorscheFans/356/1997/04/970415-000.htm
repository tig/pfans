This is a easy repair if you can find someone to do it.  The problem is
your throttle shaft has worn an oblong hole in the body of the carb.  It
also happens to throttle bodies on 914s.  A fellow lister came up with
the solution, which requires machining and installing bronizeite(?)
bushings.  he was charging $45, for his service, but no longer does it,
unfortunately.  His name is Mike Cooley, and I have the directions he
published to the list about doing this if you want them.  I am sure you
can come up with a good machinists to preform this task for you.

Don't know which will give you better performance Weber or Solex, I am an
EFI nut and know I can out perform ether over a wider performance range. 
Which BTW, I know of a system that cost about the same as Webers and is
programmable, and easy to setup, and tune.

Take care,
