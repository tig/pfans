Jack Bronson raised question concerning vehicle 215039 with engine 710207. I
believe he misread data.  According to my info this is a Karmann coupe built
after July 1963 with a 'c' engine number 710207.  
I own 21050 with engine # 710104 and this unit was assembled 9 August thru 12
Aug 1963.  This was the "first C in the USA" and delivered to Porsche of
America Corp.  It was used by Eric Filius, Exec VP and as a PR car.  I
purchased it in August 1964.

I think there is no inconsistency.  Body numbers are assigned as built.
 Engines are built with there serial numbers and then blended on Zuffenhausen
floor for sales. My guess is the vehicle in question was assembled after mine
since the engine number is higher.  At 35 cars per day some of which were
SC's this could be 1 -2 weeks difference.

Porsche Cars NA could straighten out all the questions for there
certification fee.

Jack, do you have any hbistory on this car?
