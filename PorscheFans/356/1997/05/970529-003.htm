A big thanks to all who responded a while back regarding the 
"Solex vrs. Weber" debate.  I opted to send my Solex's into
Eurometrix and have the bottom halfs reworked.  When I got
them back (last Thursday), I reassembled them with new kits --
bueno!  :-)  :-)  :-)

Now for the questions --

Question 1:
The stock distributor (031, I think) is slipping timing.  The 
dwell is not changing, so I know that it is physically moving
in the shaft.  Could this be due to a worn clamp, or are the
bushings in the distributor bad and causing friction (it seems
to move freely).  How would I check either problem?  FWIW: I've
tried a 009 distributor, and didn't remember any problems with
it slipping timing.

Question 2:
Ever since my last oil change (my first oil change since I've
had the car), I've had a little smoke (mostly white -- hint of 
blue) that protrudes from the exhaust under ecceleration.  Could
it be (1) the previous owner knew of a smoking problem and put
motor honey in the oil to increase oil viscosity, or (2) there's
some magic oil out there that I don't know about so I just use
what the owner's manual recommended (Penzoil SAE30), or (3) I 
know that some oil has been leaking into the right hand heat exchanger
because every once in a while I see a little smoke come out the
right side floor vent inside the car.  Could this be smoke 
generated in the heat exchanger?

I did a compression test on the car, and found the following
results:  cyl 1, 2, 3 = 130-135 psi.  cyl 4 = 160 psi.  When I 
bought the car, I had the car inspected by a local Porsche 
mechanic, and he got similar compression except for cylinder 4 --
which now is higher.  I've been told that high compression
for a cylinder could be the result of carbonization.  Could 
running on worn solexs for a while caused cyl 4 to carbonize?
Can I use a gas additive to help the situation?  Or am I destined
to pull/inspect the heads/cylinders, decarbinize the heads
and valves, and maybe do a re-ring job?  FWIW:  the engine is 
supposedly a fresh 1720cc.  I've put about 1000 miles on the car
since I bought it.  Unless some rings didn't seat correctly, I'm
curious where the smoke is coming from.

Any help would be much appreciated.
