Last year we bought a 1956 356 speedster but the car has 2 different 
doors.
One door is of the original type, it is closed on the top side,      
it has an open inner structure and the doorhandle is in the 
centre of the door. So that's all ok.
The left door is also closed on on the topside but has the inner
structure of a normal door, so that the door handle is on the top
and not in the centre of the door. There has never been welded on the 
door and it's complete original.

My question is : Has anybody seen such a speedster door before ?
                 Did the doors change in 1957 when the high bow 
                 hoodframes were introduced ?
                 This Speedster was shipped to Japan maby that
                 this makes a difference.
                 

I'm looking forward  to your answers.
