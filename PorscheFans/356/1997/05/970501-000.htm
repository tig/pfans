Dear Terry:


         Yes, the Webers can be installed with either the Weber Manifold, or
with a Solex Manifold and the Weber Adapto-plate. However, no one's ever made
an Adapto to adapt Solexes to Weber Manifolds.

    No, a far, far better thing to do is to use Solex Intake Manifolds with
your Solexes
However, please check the Side Vertical Sheet Metal to see ifin someone
"trimmed" the sheet metal to fit the Weber Manifolds. If so, then the sheet
metal won't fit tightly around the Solex manifolds.  Fortunately, Side
Vertical Sheet Metal is available.

.. And  don't forget, you'll also need the  "Insulator blocks" for the Solex
Intake Manifolds, which for a  later 912's are Steel and no longer "insulator
blocks". 356's and early 912's used the Bakelite blocks which really WERE
insulators. 
   Oh, and if you're running the Vacuum Retard Distributor (the .061) and the
Throttle Positioner, then you need  the metal "insulator" blocks, two of
which must have the vacuum take-off lines attached.  

Keep the 356/912 Faith
Maestro



In a message dated 97-04-30 16:15:58 EDT, you write:

<<  fishing a new housing through the tunnel.
 
 2)  Somewhere in the past 29 years a PO installed Webers and I now want
     to reinstall the original Solex. It appears the intake manifolds
     are one piece, specifically for the Webers and do not just have
     Solex --> Weber adapters.  Are there indeed 2 ways to mount Webers
     (ie 1) using replacement manifolds; 2) original manifolds + adapters) ?
     If I have method 1 I'm certain I'll need to drop the engine (yecch,
     just did that last fall) unless Weber --> Solex adapters exist (?)
 
     (I'm not meaning to incite the Weber vs. Solex debate, my mind has
     been made up.)
 
 Grateful for your insights,
 
 --Terry--
