Experience with? You betcha! Had to drive home one night with one arm -
the other was holding the passenger door shut! You are definitely on the
right track suspecting the grease congealing. I have experienced two
failure modes that result in this symptom:

1.  The grease is dry/dirty/old/whatever, and the ratchet "lock" that
keeps the latch in the closed position does not spring fast enough to
catch the second tooth on the latch. It does, however, catch the first
tooth, which means the door will close (ajar) and lock. Solution: remove
the latch mechanism, and thoroughly clean and lubricate it. When I had
my car apart for painting, I put the latches through the dishwasher
(maybe this could be another topic for "the Kitchen Mechanic" ?!?).
Alternatively, you could remove the door panel and give the latch a good
soaking with WD40 or equivalent. You won't be able to get at the culprit
part without removing the door panel.

2.  The wire that connects the inside opener lever to the latch
mechanism has bent and wedged itself in the lever mechanism. I suspect
that the case with your car is my first scenario, because when scenario
#2 happens, you can't close the door at all. This is the failure mode
that resulted in an evening of one-handed driving. Solution: lubricate
the lever pivot and unbend or replace the actuating cable. 

I hope this helps you solve your problem. I know this type of problem
can be very frustrating because it is not usually described in
maintnenace/repair manuals. That's the beauty of this list!
