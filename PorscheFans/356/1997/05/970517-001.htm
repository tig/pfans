Hello all,

I purchased a set of chrome exhaust extensions from Stoddard. In their
catalog they proclaim they are just a force fit into the exhaust opening in
the bumper guard.

I have removed my rear bumper and exhaust funnels. I thoroughly cleaned
everything,  had the funnels sand blasted and I have just painted them black.
I am now going to reinstall all and at the same time install the chrome
extensions.

I must be missing something!! There is no way that you can force fit the
extensions into anything!! The extensions are oval on one end and round on
the other, also the diameter of the extensions are much smaller than the hole
in the bumper guard.  From looking at pictures of other 356's that have these
extensions installed, it appears that the round end is the one that protrudes
out from the bumper guard. There doesn't appear to be any way that the oval
end (for that matter the round end) can either surround the outside of the
funnel or fit into it. The funnel is oval but a thinner and longer oval than
the extension.

I need some help, please

Thanks,
