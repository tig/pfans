Over the last several months, I have asked questions and you have given me
great advice. I am nearing the point of painting my restoration project, a 64
SC coupe. All numbers match, only one previous owner, car was never in a
wreck. We did have to replace several rusted areas with new metal. The
original paint was completely removed. We are trying to do everything right.
I plan to keep the car forever. Now for the question:
The original color is light ivory. No offense to all of you with light ivory
cars, but it just doesn't do anything for me. I would have selected red if I
were the original purchaser. I do not plan on entering any serious concours.
Is it a mistake to change colors?
One obvious answer will be "It's your car, paint it any color you want". But
I would like to hear the arguements both for and against to help me decide.

2nd issue: Floor is solid, but someone got happy with a floor jack or it high
sided a large rock. Floor is distorted in the center near the front and the
back near the transmission. Should the floor pan be replaced? (ouch) or just
attempt to straighten it as best we can?
