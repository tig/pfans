Hi all,

Wondering if anyone can help with tracing the history of the following:

1964 356 C sunroof coupe
slate grey/red leatherette
chassis # 216607
engine # 712258

Car is now in Massachusetts and I have owned it for two years (1995-Present).
Car has been in New Hampshire (1992-1995), Pennsylvania (1988-1992). I have
PA title which shows a previous owner had titled it there in 1988. That title
indicates that the previous titled state was Georgia. I called GA DMV and
their records don't go back that far and couldn't confirm.

I have just received the PCA Certificate of Authenticity for the car and
everything matches; numbers, colors, options. It would be great to trace it
back to it's beginning. 

Any help or suggestions would be most welcome!

Thanks,
Bob Soldani
