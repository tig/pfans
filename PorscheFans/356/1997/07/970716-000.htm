I am presently restoring and doing 90% of the work myself.  I am
intimate with many places I didn't think I would be......

Questions:
.. I have catalogues from Stoddards and Tweeks.  Are there other good
sources.  The body shop did order parts from Tweeks and there opinion
was mixed.  Is one better than the other?

.. Is there a good source of a colored wiring diagram for my car?  I
presently have a green wire and 2 white with beige(?) strip that go
nowhere and stop in the battery area.  It apears that the white w beige
go to left and right somethings.

..  If I buy carpet sets from Tweeks/Stoddards should I have an
upholstery shop install it.  I also need a headliner that I would not
install myself.  So She would be at the shop anyway.  It there a better
source?

Thanx
.
