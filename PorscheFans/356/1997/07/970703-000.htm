Michel,

Well, it just so happens that I'm doing a full restoration on my 1967 912
and it's just been repainted to restore it to its original Aga Blue color a
couple of weeks ago!  Like you, I have a real hard time figuring out what a
car is going to look like based upon a 1x1-in color swatch.  I was
extremely nervous about going with the color, but I was committed to making
the car original, and now that I see it on the entire car, I think it looks
gorgeous! .  I made sure the bodyshop was very careful in matching the
color to the original color that had been undisturbed under the dash cover.
 So if you are anywhere near the San Francisco Bay Area let me know and
I'll give you directions to the shop where they're putting the finishing
touches on it (in San Jose).  

A word of caution if you decide to go ahead and paint your car Aga Blue.
The "Aga Blue" that Glasurit ships these days is not at all like the
original Aga Blue.  It's much too dark and washed out.  The shop that's
doing the job ended up sending the paint back, asked for new paint without
the black pigment, and then slowly added the black themselves to match the
original color under my dash cover.  It seems that the base for the paint
and the pigments they use these days are completely different from that
which they used back in the 60s (no lead, etc.) but they continue to use
the same formula.  Unfortunately, the formula doesn't yield the same color
with the new ingredients!

By the way, where did you locate a swatch sample???  My bodyshop swore that
one wasn't available.  The catalogs they have from that era merely give a
few standard color swatches and say something like "Aga Blue is a little
darker than xxx, more intense than xxx, and has a little bit of xxx added"!
