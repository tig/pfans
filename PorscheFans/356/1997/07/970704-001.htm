Well folks, installed the GT tank and got the A outlaw on the road for the
first time today. My goal was to give the old girl a 4th of July independence
day from the garage and jack stands. Our history  proves independence is
sometimes costly. Really cool until ride, good noises and stuff, and was
traveling at pretty good break in speed (read faster than needed), hit a bump
and BOOM, I suddenly had this really big black front braking air foil in my
face. Yep, the properly adjusted (?) hood latch popped and my beautiful
unrusted, undinked hood literally blew apart with a great tearing of metal
sound. Kinda gooned the cowl a little too, but all considered, things didnt
get worse (like compared to crashing and needing a whole car). So I unbolted
it, dropped it at the landfill and continued the test ride. Does anyone have
an unrusted, unrepaired, untweeked "A" hood for sale? Has to be a reeaaaal
good one & am willing to pay fair price. Or know of where one is? Oh, uh also
need a front hinge. Buy, trade. Please call George at 703 644-0025. Thanks
folks.
