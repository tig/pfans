Do not drive the car until you can determine what is wrong. The 912 case has 
very limited clearances, and anything comming apart inside could potentially 
destroy the case, crank, and other VERY expensive parts. 
First thing to check is the oil screen. (Drain oil, remove screen from 
bottom of engine) look for little shiny metal shavings. IF they are copper 
colored then it's likely a bearing failure. Next, check valve play, as if 
you were adjusting all the valves (Any evidence of a broken/bent valve will 
be apparent there). E-mail me if you need additional help, and I can put you 
in touch with someone that can help.

>I'm not looking forward to tommorrow morning.  A mile from my house

>Let me describe and I ask for any suggestions on what it could be.

>It initially sounded like a hole in a header.  However, it has more

>against the sheet metal.  But that's not it.  I'm really thinking
>it's like a valve hitting a piston or something making contact like
>that.  What would that sound like, anyhow ?  It persists with no
>load on the engine, but fades at idle.  I didn't get a chance to
>look any closer after parking it since I had to come back in to work
>tonight (where I am, with email access) (took other car) so I can't
>offer much else.  I'll probably end up popping the valve covers off
>and examining things there if the noise persists.

>What are the typical items prone to failure on '68 912 engines that
