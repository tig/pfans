>>Subject: Original Wood Steering Wheel??

>>Hi Guys,
>>   Anyone out there know if you could order a '69 912 with a wooden
steering
>>wheel. We just bought a '69 912 that had an engine fire. The car looks
>>excellent and has front and back chrome  nerf bars and an original looking
>>wood steering wheel that looks the same as an original one made of plastic
>>except the outer wheel is made of wood . Does anyone know if the steering
>>wheel and nerf bars could have been original equipment. 
>>Thanks Chrissy

OK, I Know this. Option #9265 was a peachy Wooden steering wheel. It would
set you back $37.50 US. My list of dealer installed options doesn't include
the nerf bars, but I'm pretty sure most dealers would give you one for some
price. Look really close at the chrome to see if the oxidation and finish are
the same as the bumperets.
I'm looking at an issues of "Excellence" from Feb. 1988 and from Dec of 1991,
there's a 1968 912 soft window Targa with nerf bar between the front
bumperetts. 
My bestest guess would be that nerf bar was not an option for the 1969 912
but, could be purchased from the dealer anyway.
Hope your get that smokey smell out and get that honey on the road real soon.
This will be my third summer with my 1969 912 and I smile every time I even
think about driving it. Visit your red line often.
