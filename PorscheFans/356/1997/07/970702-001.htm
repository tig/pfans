Aloha all!

First of all I would like that you folks for your valuable technical info! 
 Being on a Island with minimum resources, this list has given me an 
opportunity to dialog with a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable group that 
share my interest of the "TUB".

I have seen and read about gas tank cleaners/sealers.  It seams to be an 
option but I'm a little concern should rust return.  This stuff would be 
very difficult to remove or even impossible if the tank needs  to be 
retreated.  Any of you folks have experience with this process?

An after thought:

I'm cleaning up the engine sheet metal and planning to repaint.  First of 
all do I need to consider "high temp paint since some of the pieces are 
actually bolted to the engine and are near the muffler system.  What's the 
best way of prepping for painting.

Lastly...for economical reasons (and we really don't need  heaters in 
Hawaii), I'm replacing my leaking stock "J" tube with those plain third 


party "J" tubes.  I have noticed that the "flapper box" are bolted the stock 
"J" tube assembly.  So if I install the plain tubes there will be  no means 
for bolting on the flapper box to the J tube assembly.  What should I do 
with the flapper boxes, are they secured on the engine by other means, or 
are they critical to engine cooling... leave them on or remove?

Much Mahalos (Thanks)
