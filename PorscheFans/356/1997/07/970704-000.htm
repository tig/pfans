As an original owner of a '69 912, I know that the wood steering wheel
and nerf bars were not Porsche options, nor were they dealer options,
when I ordered my car from an Oakland, CA dealer in '68. The "Optional
Equipment" section of the Porsche Fact Book for that year includes
leather steering wheel and "rubber pads on front and rear bumper guards"
(standard equipment for 911 E and 911 S). 

The nerf bars were made by AMCO and sold for approximately $25 (rear)
and $18 (front). The teak steering wheel and dash insert were
discontinued either in '67 or '68, and unavailable as a '69 option. I
have a vague recollection, which may be wrong, that wood appointments
had been legislated out, or voluntarily discontinued, for a number of
years for safety reasons. 

If you would like a copy of the Standard and Optional equipment page
from the original Fact Book, send me your address and I will mail you a
photocopy.
