I am posting this for one of the local 356ers in our area. I haven't seen the
car nor do I have any interest in it. I am copying the ad.
 For Sale:
60 Roadster, 1600 Normal engine that is out and disassembled. The body is
solid overall. There are holes in the floorpan and one wheel well. Rust is
ahead of the doors and where the top hinges attach. The Longitudinals need
work. All crirical inner panels are solid, the battery area needs repair.
There is no evidence of any serious collision. The top is in good condition
except the window. The trans has two front mounts and the doors don't sag.
The asking price is $12,500 and the car is located in South Lyon, Mi. Ask for
Chuck Fretwell  at 248-486-0828
Chuck would like $5.00 for a complete set of pictures which will be refund
when the pictures are sent back. Good luck
