In response to some of your questions:

Questions:
.. I have catalogues from Stoddards and Tweeks.  Are there other good
sources.  The body shop did order parts from Tweeks and there opinion
was mixed.  Is one better than the other?

Other sources for 356 parts include Autos International, Automotion, Klasse
356 and Zims.  All but Zims have a web page I believe.  The links all can be
found on the 356 Registry web page. http://www.356registry.org/  If you have
not already joined the 356 Registry I would recommend it highly.  Their
publication has excellent information as well as several advertisers that
service the 356 industry. Information on how to join is on their web page. 
Otherwise send $25 and a note saying you wont to join the 356 registry to: 
Barbara Skirmants, 
27244 Ryan Road, 
Warren, MI 48092 

You can also buy (or thumb through) a copy of 'excellence' at your local
bookstore.  Several suppliers of 356 parts advertise in it.  Used parts are
available through several places on the web.  Aase Bros. come to mind at:
http://www.webworldinc.com/AASEBROS/ or (714) 956-2419 

Try this website for most Porsche links/info on the web.

.. Is there a good source of a colored wiring diagram for my car?  I
presently have a green wire and 2 white with beige(?) strip that go
nowhere and stop in the battery area.  It apears that the white w beige
go to left and right somethings.

I understand that Charlie White has colored wiring diagrams available at
reasonable prices.  He can be contacted via EMAIL at charlie@suncap.com  He has 
Workshop manuals and other good info available as well.
