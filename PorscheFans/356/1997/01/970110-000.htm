   I believe low oil pressure at idle when hot is both normal and
tolerable. At idle, there is not much load on the engines.  That is why you
see these advertisements for oil additives that show engines being run for
hours WITHOUT OIL -- they just run them at idle!

   As for temperatures, the US expert on Porsches, Bruce Anderson, has the
following policy:


>180 - 220 F: normal operating temp   (82 - 104 C)
>230: warm                             (110 C)
>240: hot                              (115 C)
>250: too damn hot                     (121 C)


   So it appears that your oil temperature really is too hot.  Sorry, I
don't have any advice that you haven't already thought of (blocked oil
cooler, car running way too lean, improper engine sheet metal, bad oil
pump, etc.)

Hope this helps,
