First, congratulations!!  I bought my first car when I was 15 1/2 and took my
drivers test in it.  Happy to see the youngsters getting into these passionate
little cars.

You couldn't have picked a better car.  There are absolutely no differences in
performance...only cosmetic, which I feel is BEAUTIFUL.  Many 356 owners leave
these for dead, but I  feel they're a wonderful looking car that will make a
comeback in the 356  market.  If the car you've found is a late '62, you're that
much better off.

Good luck and keep up informed...

ciao,
chris
