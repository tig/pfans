Not having owned that many 356's, (I have owned 3 356s since 1970, and 1 
911), I can only tell you my experiences.  You didn't say what part of 
the country you live in.  It does make a difference.  On the West Coast, 
where there is low humidity, generally, the cars are in better 
condition, insofar as the chassis/body/frame components go.  

My belief is that the chassis/body/frame should be as original as 
possible to get a good car.  Although expensive, the running gear 
(engine, tranny, suspension, brakes, steering, etc.) can always be 
repaired/replaced.  

My 1963B coupe body was in very good condition, but when I started a six 
year ground up restoration, I thought I would be able to restore the car 
with a minimum of expense.  Boy, was I wrong!  There is ALWAYS more rust 
than it first appears.  Since the unibody construction of the 356 is 
sheet metal welded together, there is almost always rust in between spot 
welds along an overlapped weld joint.  My suggestion would be to put the 
car on a hoist and look very carefully at the "X" brace in the center 
front (under the gasoline tank).  Also, closing panels to the rear of 
the front wheel wells, rocker panels, longitudinals, door bottoms, front 
of rear wheel wells (where the door striker nuts are), and any other 
area you can observe.  Repair of these places is most often done with 
repair panels sold by Zims, Stoddard, and others, but the main expense 
is LABOR.  If you can do it yourself, great!  If not, plan on spending 
anywhere from $29/hour UP!  It's not cheap to get it done right.  It's 
very expensive if it doesn't get done right and you don't find our until 
the very expensive paint is finished.  A word to the wise here.

I just completed my restoration a few months ago, and now I'm enjoying 
it!  Let me if this helps!
