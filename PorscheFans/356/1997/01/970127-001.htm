Kevin McNamara asks

>> I am a 17 year old trying to learn as much about the 356 as I can, and
 hopefully buying one soon.  My question is, What is a Karmann Notchback?
 They seem to sell for less than a normal 356 coupe, is there something
 mechanically different about them, or is the difference in the looks?
         I would really appreciate any help you could give.
 
There's nothing wrong with them, they just weren't popular when they were new
and they're not popular now. Basically, it's a Cabriolet body with the hard
top welded in place. If you've ever seen a 356 convertible (not a Speedster,
or Roadster, or Convertible D) with the optional hard top installed, now
imagine that hard top firmly joined to the body, with no gap visible, and
painted in the same color as the body, you've got a Karmann hardtop coupe.
Some say the outward visibility was a bit better than the normal, familiar
"fastback" coupe, because of greater glass area. 

If you want to read up on the history of the 356, the best book (if I do say
so myself, I did the translation from German) is Dirk-Michael Conradt's
"Porsche 356 --- Driving in its purest Form." Price is $65. Motorbooks has it
but the publisher, Brett Johnson, would be most grateful for any direct
orders (especially if you mention you heard it from me). Re the Karmann
notchback coupe, there is a photo on p. 142 that shows it next to a cabriolet
with hardtop installed. Tables at the end say 1846 Karmann hardtops were
built. The book is 263 pages, high quality paper and cloth hardcover, lots of
illustrations in b/w and color. The author based the book on his digging
through factory archives, records, meeting minutes, memos, and the like, so
it's as official as it gets. 

Brett Johnson told me yesterday that after Motorbooks ordered another large
shipment, there are only a couple dozen copies left in the warehouse. It
might be reprinted after it runs out, but it would be a good idea for anybody
who wants it to get theirs now. Brett Johnson ("Beeman Jorgensen") is at
1-800-553-5319.


>>Hopefully a 356 soon.
 
Go for it. You can get a high quality 356 (not a project, not a rustbucket,
not a beater) for about what you'd spend for a new Honda Civic. Now, what's
the Honda going to be worth in two years, and what will the Porsche be worth?
