Here's a thread from todays KG digest...
Personally, I powdercoat the sheet metal satin black, plate the hardware
with zinc, and have it finished in clear (an almost white or silver with
a touch of blue), black, or yellow, or combinations of these for contrast.
(Some original components were plated cadmium, which is a yellow color,
but cad is very un-friendly environmentally - Yellow zinc looks the same
and is actually HEALTHY for you and the environment! ...In one or two
cases I have left items in "original unrestored" condition as the 
"patina" is rather nice.

I also think "neat and tidy", without ANYTHING looking "added" is a big
plus. Some examples with wiring: NO wire ties, no electrical tape windings
(use black vinyl tubing instead), no crimp-on connectors and especially
not with insulators in red, blue, yellow, etc. Wires should be either stock,
or of the right length that they don't need to be wound up or what have you.

If you do add anything - quality is sexy!

.... I have an extra "rule" ... NO CHROME! Chrome is even worse for the
environment. It has a lot of problems mechanically - for example, it's
brittle, and it acts as an INSLUATOR of heat (a really bad thing), and
it makes the parts thicker, heavier, etc. Further, to my mind, spending
money on chrome just proves you don't care about engineering - "all show,
no go!" Usually, a really pretty engine means it doesn't run worth a damn,
and it doesn't make much HP... Surely not always true, but often enough.

Good luck.

Just to add that a good powder coat makes the engine so much easier to keep
clean
and a clean engine is a happy engine.
