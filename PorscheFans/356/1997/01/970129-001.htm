Krispin asked about getting power out of a 912 engine and Jay replied   
about why and turning oranges to bananas.

Kirspin, Jay is almost completly right.  I have done what you are talking   
about.  I went all out for power on my 69 912.  The price tag wasn't   
8ight but a good 6ix.  The final result is a very fun car but still not   
blindingly fast and an engine that needs to be taken apart every year.

So Jay does have a point.  Why?

It depends on the use you are going to put it to.  If you are going to   
track the car then a 911 would be a better idea.  The bigger displacement   
means the engine is not working so hard and also will have a better top   
speed.

If you are going to autocross then the 912 engine is better.  Your 912   
will be very close to a 914 for handling but will have more power and   
less weight.  I won our regions driving championship in an almost stock   
912 with a hot engine.  Actually for autocross you don't even need to hop   
up the engine.  The stock 912 has lots of torque and will rev quite high   
when you don't have time to shift.  Just make sure that you have the   
stock Solex carbs on it.  They work the best, they just need to be   
accurately tuned.

Anyway,  if you have money to burn then really jaz that engine up.  Vic   
Skirmants (spelling?) is a place to start.  You'll need:
Bigger HC Pistons with deep valve relief
Barrells to match
Cam
Intake valves
Porting
Exhaust
Larger venturies
Larger oil pump
Enlarge oils passages
Oil cooler (BIG ONE)
Bigger Clutch
Velocity Stacks
Lighten Flywheel
Better Ignition (CDS will do, no points, use Pertronix)
Balance
Dyno and jet carbs

(some more secret stuff)

and the result is an easy 140hp, possible 180hp (race fuel)

lighten the car and away you go.  I figure i'm getting about 165hp at   
7,700rpm.
It'll pull wheel to wheel with a stock 3.2 Carrera but out brake it like   
crazy.

It is fun to have a small engine wind up like that but it is also a lot   
of fun to drive my friends RSR!

To each his own.
