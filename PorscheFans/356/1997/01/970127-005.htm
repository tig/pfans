<< I am in the process of restoring a 356C. I will have several questions
along
 the way in an effort to do things properly. Any help will be appreciated.
 1. Is it ok to powder paint the engine sheet metal (black) vs wet paint?
Yes, IMHO powder paint is great.  Color?  Well you've got to check with the
PC (Porsche Correct) Police. You don't want it too shiny.  I'm going with
what my local powder painter calls Vulcan Black.
 2. What about the fan cover? Is there a powder paint that's the correct
gray? If you have the original fan cover try to eye match it with the color
chips the powder painter has. Don't obssess. You could get a spray can from
Stoddard and spray that on some metal-match that with the Powder Paint chips,
etc. The "correct" gray was probably never that, never controlled by color
code at the factory in those days. I don't know this, am just surmising it.
 So, close is probably good here as in horse shoes.
 Where do you obtain the correct wet color if that's the way to go?
 3.Air flapper boxes, black powder ok? Yes, I would think this would be OK
too.
 4. Can the wheels be rechromed without cutting and rewelding the centers? I
don't know about this.
 5. Are the Stoddard interior parts the way to go, or have an upholstry shop
 start from scratch? Any recommendations for shops on the "left" coast? >>I
had IMHO (again) a great job done in Mt. View (N. Cal. at Sids (see Hugo). I
understand Autos International in S. Cal. is very good. As for your local
shop, well, we don't know the first thing about them-could be great, could be
horrible.  Have they produced any concours winners, for example.
