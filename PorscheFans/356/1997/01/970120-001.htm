Krispin-
I am in the process of restoring a 68 912 softback.  I also autox a 914. 
Been in the Porsche club for years.  First question I have to ask is what
you are going to do with the car.  Being a racer and of racer mind,
everyday I think about putting a 6 in either my 914 or the 912.  But
everyday I talk myself out of it.  I am bumping the 914 up to a 2.0 from
a 1.7 but I decided that the 912 just has to remain stock.  I am not one
of these purist freaks, my 912 will have a Bursh exhaust, maybe larger
valves and the carbs tweeked a little but still the same size.  And I
have to have my CD player!  I remember a couple of years ago, a guy would
show up at the autox's once or twice a year, with a beautiful restored
67.  This car was all original, except for the shocks, bars, and exhaust.
 This car flew!  The weight balance on a 912 is fantastic, much better
than a 911.  The other part was the driver.  When I picture my 912 done,
this is the car I have in my mind.
Have you checked out the cost of new cylinders?  Holy Cow!  When I get to
that part I hope my P & C's look good enough to rering and I don't have
to drop the big bucks.  Right now, the car is slowly getting ready to go
to the body shop and get repainted.  I have a floorpan to replace and
rust under both headlight buckets.  The plan is to get the body done,
then the top and back window, then the motor.  I know how I am and if I
get the motor done first, I won't want to stop driving it to paint it!  I
have a couple of buddies with 912s in progress or complete.  They are a
great resource for hard to find parts, and ideas, but the Pfans list is
great!  I would be interested in sharing stories, parts sources, and
whatever else.  Keep in touch!
Talk to you later-
