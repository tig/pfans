<< Can somebody tell me what is the reason for the shape of the left side of
 the battery box on a T6 body.On the basket case I am restoring,this is
 completely corroded and is missing the round cover on the outer edge whose
 function is also a mystery.
  >>

That oval bulge is there to receive the optional (and rare) gasoline heater.
There is a small rubber plug (about 1 1/4 inch diameter?) in the center of
the bulge which is removed when the heater is installed, and the gas heater
exhaust pokes through there. 

The bulges are now available as repro pieces. I think Stoddard has them. Or
maybe it was Restoration Design in Michigan. On one of my cars, the bottom
edge of the bulge was corroded away where it joins the flat vertical panel,
so I fabricated a C-shaped strip of steel, bent into a corner angle and then
stretched to conform to the edge of the bulge. Carefully fit, MIG welded, and
ground down, it is invisible.
