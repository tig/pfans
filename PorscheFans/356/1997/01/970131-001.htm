Terry Derloshon asks

>>I would like to
 know what solutions 912 and 356 owners implement.  Hardened valve seats ?
 Lead substitute ?  Not-to-worry ?  

Yes, Not-to-worry.

>>I do use a spurt of lead substitute in 
 each full tank of gas in my '68 912.  After two years no obvious
side-effects
  - webers not gummed, plugs normal - but no idea about valve condition.
 
Not necessary. 

Porsche went from I think bronze valve seats to hardened ones about 1960.
Anything made after that doesn't care whether it's leaded or unleaded gas. 

Another factor in long valve life is the sodium-cooled exhausts as used on
the 356 SC and 912 engine. It's not a bad idea to retrofit these even on
non-SCs. I think all 911s used sodium-cooled valves. 

While I was working at Porsche in the 1980s, we had a customer (Porsche
designed a water-cooled four cylinder for them) who was concerned about valve
seat wear with the upcoming European low-lead and no-lead fuels. We had
designed ordinary modern hardened seats into their engine but tested it
anyway. I ran a prototype engine for I think 200 hours at wide open throttle,
alternating between max torque rpm and max horsepower rpm, measuring valve
seat recession along the way. There was no measurable wear attributable to
the lack of lead in the fuel. 

There is a lot of BS spread around these days about how bad modern fuel is,
how it has too low octane, etc. These stories are usually started by people
who want to sell you some magic additives or one of their "special" engine
rebuilds using their own, rare, expensive, custom components made just for
you, and just for these modern fuels. There is no problem with modern fuel
from an octane or lead standpoint. Owners in areas that have so-called
"oxygenated" or "reformulated" fuel may need to fool with the jetting a bit
to correct the deliberate leaning out that these fuels cause. These fuels are
the bureaucrats' way of leaning out your fuel mixture without ever touching
the carburetor. I have a 356 SC with 90K miles since I had the engine
rebuilt, running the entire time on 92 octane California "reformulated" fuel,
and slalomed on weekends, and I'm not worried.
