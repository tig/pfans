The most extensive studies I have seen about Valve seat regression in Older
engines was funded by the BMW Motorcycle owners club. They determined in
non-cast iron heads with separate pressed-in type of valve seats, Unleaded
gas posed no additional wear than its leaded version. Now in your Studebaker
flat 8, It had a cast iron block with the seats just ground out to the head
material was a candidate for rapid wear of valve seats from unleaded gas.
Since the precautions were made to install hardened seats in the head for the
first time,  save the money you been spending on lead substuite and buy
better gas instead.
