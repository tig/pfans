I earlier posted a query to the 914 group about identifying some heads I 
have.  I got some responses, but the heads don't seem to match 914 or VW 
specs exactly.  Could they be 356/912 heads?

The spot where the intake manifold attaches has two studs at each end and 
a hole in the center - which may have threads in it (I forgot to check).  
It does not have 4 bolts which I understand was from the VW or 1.7 or 1.8 
914.  The 2.0 914 has three bolts, I don't know if that would match what 
these have.

The exhaust ports are at the ends of the heads with long rectangular holes 
and two holes for bolts.  I understand this suggests back to the 
VW/1.7/1.8 - but it does not have the 4 bolt intake.

So, it does not meet the 914 2.0 specs or the VW/1.7 or 1.8 914 specs.

Lastly, the heads are very rectangular.  That is each of the sides are 
perfectly straight and the corners are just slightly rounded (like 1/4" 
deep).  I thought the VW heads I have seen were a little more rounded. 

Any thoughts?  Could these be from a 356?
