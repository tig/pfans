gordon moloney asked

could someone tell me if a 1961 356 porsche coupe super 90 is worth
restoring it's apparantly in a million bits and needing lots and lots of
work,or does someone out there know of a suitable car that I might be able
to accquire to work on myself as a first project? Hopefully an early model.

Unless you have personally inspected the pile of parts and are absolutely 
certain that everything is there and are buying it from a trustworthy 
person, I would hesitate to take over someone else's disassembled 356.  A 61 
Super 90 is definitely worth restoring provided it is not too far gone.  The 
problem you have, from my perspective, is that you have no way of knowing 
how much is missing from the pile of parts, and most parts are very 
expensive to replace.  Plus, you have the added disadvantage of not knowing 
how it all goes together in the first place.

You mentioned this will be your first project.  With a disassembled car you 
can't tell how bad/or good the car was maintained before disassembly and 
unless you've tackled a restoration before I'd run fast and far from that 
Super 90, no matter how much you want it.

Take it from personal experience, be careful about your "first" restoration 
 - spend a LOT of time planning, deciding on the type of car you want, the 
price you want to pay, how much you want to restore it and how much you can 
afford.  Do you want a concours level resto. or a daily driver that looks 
and runs pretty good, but is at best only a 2- to 3+ a on a five scale (1 
being the highest, concours level)?  A full restoration of almost any car is 
not for the faint hearted.  You are talking about what may turn out to be a 
multi-year, expensive project.  BTW, it ALWAYS costs more than planned, so 
plan it, then multiply the expected cost by a factor of about 50 percent to 
get the true cost.  I just finished a frame off restoration of an old 
Triumph Spitfire and that is a cheap, cheap cheap car compared to a Porsche 
and yet I still went over budget by a couple of thousand dollars (ouch).

You didn't mention your mechanical skill level, and I am assuming it is 
pretty much "shade tree mechanic" level.  You probably don't want to hear 
this, but I'd start off with a car that is running, needs minimal "heavy" 
mechanical work and is cheap and easy to work on.  Do you have all the 
necessary tools?  Do you have the necessary space?  A dismantled car takes 
up way more room than on that is still assembled.  Do you have a workshop or 
suitable place to do the painting, prep. work, subassembly work of major 
components?  There is a lot of stuff to consider before you leap into a 
Porsche restoration (or any other for that matter).  I didn't mean to put a 
damper on your quest, but it doesn't sound like you have a good idea yet of 
what you want to do.  Anyways, that's my $.02 worth.  Good luck.
