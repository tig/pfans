I've seen the same problem with Italian aftermarket oil filters twice now.
The filter cartons are labelled Universal Oil Filter or something like that,
and they come with a nifty looking rubber gasket instead of the somewhat
cheesy looking paper gasket that comes with Mann (German) or Knecht
(Austrian) filters.

The problem is, everything is fine after you put in the new thick rubber
gasket and check for leaks. The can is nice and tight. But only a short
time/distance later, the gasket leaks, allowing oil to rapidly pump out of
the filter can. It makes a mess in the engine bay to say the least, and if
it's not noticed until the oil light comes on you can easily ruin an engine.

This gasket failed on me once. Prior to a Zone 8 slalom in Phoenix, I had
replaced the years-old rubber with the new one, and got as far as Barstow, in
the middle of nowhere. On restarting after a fuel stop, oil poured out. There
was no oil trail leading to the fuel pump, so it must have failed right there
at the pump. Fortunately the car was just being moved over to the restaurant
next door so I saw it right away. I had kept the old gasket in the tool kit
"just in case," borrowed a wrench for the filter can, and put the old one
back in. It's still in there, 3 years later. It's at least 6 years old by
now. I also keep a couple of the paper ones in my tool kit, again "just in
case."

It happened again yesterday, to a friend. He drove his car from his own shop,
where he had done an oil change, to his house. Driving back the next morning,
he saw some oil drips when he got to work. Garage floor at home was clean
though, so it started on the way to work. I asked if he had used the new
gasket from the Italian filter. Yup. Started it up, and oil gushed from the
can. Put in a paper gasket, it was tight.

So, word of warning, don't ever use the rubber gasket that comes with the
Italian filters. They _usually_ work but they sometimes fail without warning,
and you may or may not catch it in time. Use paper gaskets or better yet just
buy a name brand filter.
