JimSue911 asks

>>1. Is it ok to powder paint the engine sheet metal (black) vs wet paint?
2. What about the fan cover? Is there a powder paint that's the correct gray?
Where do you obtain the correct wet color if that's the way to go?
3.Air flapper boxes, black powder ok?
4. Can the wheels be rechromed without cutting and rewelding the centers?
5. Are the Stoddard interior parts the way to go, or have an upholstry shop
start from scratch? Any recommendations for shops on the "left" coast?

Thanks

1 and 3. Lots of people powder coat, and it's great, tough, durable stuff,
but for the absolute show car purists, you can tell it's powder coated
(coating is thicker) and the originality freaks stay with sprayed-on paint.
It's not full gloss, a sort of semi-gloss. For me, powder coat is just fine.

2. I agree with Alan Henderson, there is no one "correct" color. It's a light
gray that varies from car to car. I've seen several different shades, all on
original fan shrouds. 

4. No, the centers have to be cut out to rechrome. They're welded back in
after chroming. You can't do it any other way because the acids used in
plating would otherwise hide in the joint and cause serious problems (like
corrosion and wheel failure) later.

A Stoddard one-kit-fits-all interior is your only choice if you don't have
access to a pro. It will never be as good as a kit that was trimmed to fit
exactly in YOUR car. Autos International is good but expensive. Others are
just as good and considerably more affordable. I know of two shops in San
Diego that do outstanding work at a very reasonable price: Thomas Auto Trim
and Ocean Beach Upholstery. Thomas gets all my business;
Thomas Pocius
3826 Sherman St.
Suite C
San Diego, CA  92110
1-619-299-1356

Ocean Beach is comparable, 
4838 Voltaire St.
San Diego, CA  92107
619-223-9797

I feel that the work done by Thomas and OB is so good that it's worth towing
down from as far as the bay area. I'm 90 miles N of Thomas and still take my
work down there.
