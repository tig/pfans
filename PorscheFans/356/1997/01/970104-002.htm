Jody,
I guess it's always possible that someone (turkey?) could have used 
loctite on the flywheel gland nut, but I believe that I would put just a 
little more leverage on the 36mm socket.  

You mentioned that you welded (?) a socket onto a 36" cheater?  I have 
used a 4' - 5' long pipe slid over a 1/2" breaker bar with good results. 
The use of the angle iron bolted to the flywheel is a good procedure.  
With the angle iron bolted to the flywheel, I would get about 4' - 5' 
advantage on the pipe and see what happens.  It's very likely that this 
will loosen the gland nut.  I'm interested in what you finally end up 
with.  Please let me know.
