Ross asked about factory manuals.  First, congratulations on the beginning 
of a long journey.  I don't have access to any factory manuals.  But, let 
me suggest that the biggest help on my recent restoration on a 
non-Porsche sports car was not the very good factory manual, but the club 
workshop manuals - where others who have already gone down the path of 
restoring the same car share their discoveries.  Factory manuals were not 
made with the restorer in mind. I would also suggest trying to get them 
from as many clubs as possible.  I know PCA has "Up-Fixing Der Porsche", I 
figure the 356 Registry has something really good too.  They are worth 
their weight in gold.

Good luck
