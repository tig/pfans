PORSCHING  by Chris Welty
Hudson-Valley Region, PCA

The Betrayal

Back when I was smuggling arms thru Costa-Rica to small time dictators
around the globe, it was not unusual for the phone to ring at 3 A.M.
Now that I had traded my Uzi in for a Macintosh (under the assumption
that if the pen was mightier than the sword, the word processor is
mightier than the automatic weapon), such an occurrence was rare.  When
it happened, I awoke dazed and confused.

"Hello?"

"Chris?  Is this you?" said a familiar, accented, voice.

"It's three o'clock in the morning!"

"No it is nine o'clock."

"Damn clock," I muttered and swept my alarm clock off the nightstand.

"Oh, ja, sorry.  You are right.  It is nine o'clock here, but for you
it is three."

I scrunched up my face in disbelief.  "How is that possible, what are
you on Mars or something?"

"No, Germany."

"Germany?  That's not on Mars."

"No.  But is is still nine o'clock here, and three o'clock where you
are."

I grumbled and made my apologies to the clock.  "Who is this and what
do you want at this....ummm.....hour?"

"Chris, this is Ferry Porsche.  Happy New Year.  I need a favor."

I was suddenly awake.  "Ferry Porsche, eh?  You expect me to believe
that?"

"Vell, ja, I do."

"OK, then, who won the world series?"

"The vaat?"

"Ah HA!" I exclaimed in triumph.

"Ah ha, vaat?"

"You don't honestly think that THE Ferry Porsche would have missed the
dramatic Yankee comeback of 1996?"

"OK. OK.  You are right.  The Yankees von the vorld series."

"Ah HA!" I exclaimed again.

"Vaat now?"

"I'm not sure.  Who is this again?"

"Ferry Porsche.  Chris, as you know I'm a big fan of your Porsching
column.  I read it all the time on Der Veb."

"You expect me to believe that THE Ferry Porsche would read MY
articles?"  I accused.

"Stop calling me `THE' Ferry Porsche."

"OK."

"Now, as I vas saying.  I know you are a stalvart 911 ... er, how do
you say ... bigot?"

"Hey there now, watch it..." I cautioned.

"Don't get me wrong, Chris, I secretly love it.  Of course as an
official representative of the company that I founded and that bears
my name, I can't say that in public.  And you can't reproduce that in
your column, either."

"Never, Ferry," I promised.

"You are known also to belong to the fanatical terrorist splinter
group, Baeder Airhoff, that believes real Porsches must have
air-cooled engines."

"How did you get that information?"

"I am a member myself.  And you can't print that either."

"Print?"  I laughed.  "No one prints this stuff!  Besides, only you
and my mother read it."

"Vell, my problem is this.  We at Porsche AG are getting a lot of
resistance from your group to our new water-cooled 911.  I am vorried
that violence may erupt."

"WATER COOLED 911?" I said, incredulously.

"Surely you've heard of the plans?"

"Well...uh...yeah, of course I heard about the plans, but I ... well ... A
WATER COOLED 911?"

"Yes."  Ferry paused.  "Chris, I need you to convince our fellow
Airhoffs that this is not an evil deed."

"But it most certainly IS an evil deed!  Ferry, how can you support
this?"

"It is necessary.  In order to increase performance and at the same
time decrease fuel consumption and noxious emissions..."

"WHOA!"  I interrupted.  "Ferry.  Buddy.  Although I am impressed that
the `plumbing' is still working at your age, I'm not sure I want to know
about your personal problems..."

"NOXIOUS emissions, not nocturnal!"  Ferry responded in haste.

"Oh.  Well then, I'm no longer impressed, but it's still not something
I want to know about..."

"From the CAR you idiot!"  Ferry sounded a little exasperated, but I
assumed at his age it was tough to wake up at three o'clock in the
morning. 

"Right, right, from the car," I soothed.

"These increasing demands, from the engine, have raised operating
temperatures beyond what air can effectively cool.  If we kept it
air-cooled, even casual cruising would require operating temperatures
that would melt the cylinders."

"And that would be bad, right?"

"Correct.  You and I understand that it adds unwanted weight and
complexity, not to mention that horrible smell, to something whose
simplicity was, at one time, a thing of beauty.  If you look at the
engine, now, however, it's clear we gave up on simplicity a long time
ago."

"Hmmmm," I grumbled.  "Sounds like a compromise to me.  I'm sure you
can get more performance out of an air-cooled engine."

"Oh, performance, yes - of course.  We have found no real barriers to
performance increases.  It is things like pollution control, muffling
engine noise, fuel economy, and other things that have less to do
with driving and more with the environment, for which the air-cooled
design can not function competitively anymore.  We must consider that
our customers expect performance in all these areas to exceed that of
our competitors."

I continued to grumble.  "Sounds like New Coke/Classic Coke to me."

"Chris, please."

"No.  I am unconvinced.  Ferry, you will have to change your name.
You are no longer a real Porsche."

"Chris, listen, despite your feelings, changing a car to water-cooling
is not worth violence."

I assumed the persona of my former occupation and said, coldly, "I
disagree." 

Ferry paused.  "Well then.  I wasn't expecting this to be easy.  In
return for your cooperation in this matter, I am prepared to give you
something very valuable."

"If you are going to offer me a new water-cooled 911, you're off your
flippin kilt."

"Flippin kilt?"

"That's the best I can do at three o'clock in the morning."

Ferry continued.  "I had in mind something I think you would find even
more valuable.  An inside scoop."

"Are we talking about ice cream?"  I asked, puzzled.

"No, isn't that a journalistic term?" he replied, confused.

"Oh.  Scoop.   Right, sure, that's a journalistic term."  I scribbled
that down on my notepad.  "You mean for Porsching?"

"Ja.  Exactly.  I have some top secret Porsche information which I can give
you for publication in your column.  Imagine all the hits on your web
site."

My eyes glazed over.  Web site hits.  "Yeah.  And I can add lots of
inane little icon images and get ten hits every time a single person
visits my site.  I'll have the most active page on the web!"

"Sure."

I got serious.  "Before I go and abandon all my beliefs and betray the
secret fraternal order of Baeder Airhoff, I'm going to need to know
what the information is.  If I think it's good, then I'll go along."

Ferry lowered his voice.  "Is this a secure line?"

I ran a few scans with a tricorder.  "Yes, we're clean."

"This is all very hush-hush.  We have been keeping this under tight
wraps for the past three years."  He paused for dramatic effect.  "We
are releasing this model year a new mid-engine speedster.  It will be a
small two-seater with an affordable sticker price.  It is all-new,
designed completely from scratch, we even went through the
re-invention of the steel alloy process."

"Wow,"  was all I could muster.  I was stunned.  "Ferry, this is big
news.   What's this new car going to be called?"

"The Boxster."

"Cool.  This is huge.  And this is a scoop for me?"

"That's right, no one else knows about it."

"Wow.  Can you give me some more information on the car itself?"

"Sure, there's a great article in `Road&Track' about it," Ferry
replied.

"Great," I said.  "Great.  This is fantastic.  This is going to mean
great things for my column.  OK, Ferry, I'll do it.  Consider the
Airhoff threat removed."  I thought for a moment.  "There is one
problem, however."

"What?"

"If the 911 is no longer air-cooled, and Baeder Airhoff has no
objection, what will the purpose of the organization be?"

"I though of that," Ferry replied quickly.  "Change your charter to
something like `Real Porsches have the engine in the back.'"

"Ahhhhh," I said with understanding.  "Baeder Rearhoff.  Perfect.
Thanks Fer."
