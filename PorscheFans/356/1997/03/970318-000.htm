Dear Tom:

        Sorry to hear about your Flywheel Ring Gear problem. If you'll
inspect the worn spots on the Ring Gear, I bet you'll find two places, 180
degrees out where the wear is the worst. There is, of course a Good
 Explanation for this. (and you oughta think about replacing the Starter too,
but at least check its pinion gear teeth. Oh, and  be wary of Starters these
days- as most ALL the "Porsche" Starters are but rebuilt VW's. And the VW
starter has a different placement of the solenoid that sometmes hits the
pan.)       

We have available both good, used 356 Flywheels, and  Ring Gears too, which
we can install for you. Please note that there are inferior ring gears Out
There that are rather  "skinny". We have the thicker ones available.

Keep the 356 Faith!
The Maestro

 I have a 61 356B Karmann Hardtop (the rare but valueless model) that has
 the Super engine. It has the 180mm clutch. The starter ring gear on the
 flywheel is boogered up pretty bad in some places. Does anyone have a
 used flywheel with good ring gear teeth or know of a place to get mine
 repaired? Thanks for any information. BTW, I am located in NW Louisiana.
