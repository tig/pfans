<I've recently purchased a '66 912 with a fairly new 1720cc
engine (<500 miles).  The engine runs OK but has had a 
backfire/miss problem that I've traced to a worn or 
malfunctioning Bosch 050 distributor.  Hence, the following
questions arise:

1.  If I'm going to replace the distributor, what's the best
    choice?  (Rebuilt 050 or New 009 -- I don't want to 
    afford a New 050)

2.  Also, I would eventually like to change out the points
    for something electronic (Ignitor or Allison/Crane XR700
    module).  Does anybody have experience with these 
    products and can give recommendations?>

Dear Jeff:

When I got my '66 912 years ago it has the big bore kit and the
original, but worn out 022 distributor (with two piece points, bad
design but original).  I installed an 031 distributor that had had a
similar performance curve and one-piece points.  It cost more than the
009, which people used on 914s, but the performance was worth it.  Don't
know about the 050.

Regarding the points, I never eliminated them, just put a Delta CD unit
on to prevent the points from pitting and to boost the spark voltage.  I
now have a Delta CD on my 1968 912 Targa.

Cheers,

Rick Becker
