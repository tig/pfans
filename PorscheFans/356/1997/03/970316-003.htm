While waiting for my '68 911 restoration ot be completed, I saw an ad
for a '63 356 1600S. It looks in pretty good shape, and has all its
parts in good working order.  It has been repainted (Yellow, not my
favorite color, but it looks pretty good), the seats have been
reupholstered, and it has new carpet. Started up and ran strong, but
with a strong gas smell on first startup, like it was running rich, or
getting incomplete combustion. The floor pan and suspension pan have
been replaced, and a good job of it done. I noticed one small bubble in
the paint, but could see no signs of rust looking under the car.
Question is: what sorts of things should I be wary of with the engine
and power train? 
Please reply direct to me, as I don't think I get the 356 posts now,
just the 911. I've never owned two P-cars at the same time before, but
just might if this one checks out at my mechanic's inspection.
TIA,
Luther
