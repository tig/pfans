Friends:

Just got back from a quick trip to Austria (where Nikki Lauda is still a
national hero) and a Surprise Porsche Lifetime Highspot--a visit to Gmund!

We were boogying along the autobahn south from Salzburg in a '98 Merc E320
wagon with V-6 and 4Matic and ESP and 17inch mags--cool--when we spot this
sign and see Gmund on the map!  We jump off for a trip to MECCA.!!  Helmut
Pfeifenhofer's Lil' Wooden Museum of Porsche, right there in this neat lil'
old town in the middle of nowhere in the Austrian Alps.  No wonder Dr. P went
down  there--somewhere way away from all the Late Unpleasantness.  Boy, it
got me all dewy-eyed just to be there, where it all began.

The museum is modest, but they have plenty of keen stuff--engines,
memorabilia from Dr. P's time with Daimler-Benz, Wanderer, Steyr, and more.
 Lots of old photos, a couple of winches he designed and a water turbine.
 356-wise, the body buck for the Gmund coupe, a tree stump and large wooden
mallet shaped suspiciously like a few of the curves on said coupe, plus 4-WD
Volkswagen, Schwimmwagen, the usual assortment of street cars, the 550 body
buck, a 906, 910, 959 rally car, 962, bunch of great early posters, and more.
 What a great treat!

They have a little store, and I found a cool book on Otto Mathe, but it's in
German (Peter--wanna translate it?).  All in all, the chance encounter of a
liftetime, and after 30 years of goofing around with these cars, a day I'll
remember always.  Maximum recommendation for everyone with a Porsche!  A
Great Experience!  Do It!
