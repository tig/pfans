Neil Worley asked

<< Restoring a 65 Coupe, should the license plate and bumper brackets be
 painted body color or black? Where can I find horsehair for interior sound
 deadening?
  >>

Don't know about the license plate bracket; the only ones I know are the rear
ones, and they come cad plated. I don't have front ones on any car I have. 

The bumper brackets were originally dipped in gloss black lacquer. You can
paint them gloss black or send them out for powder paint. Powder will
probably come out looking closest to the original dip finish. For concours
folks who don't want to powder paint, they'd have to prime, paint, sand, and
rub out (maybe several times) to get the original finish.

The sound deadener was not horsehair but jute padding. Bill Perrone at The
Parts Shop stocks the biggest supply of authentic repro sound deadener.
714-894-3112. He has all the possible engine and front trunk sound deadener
variations and perhaps can also make the interior stuff.
