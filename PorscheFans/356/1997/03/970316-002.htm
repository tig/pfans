Porsche Friends:

Just got back from a quick trip to Austria (where Nikki Lauda is still their
national hero) and have to tell you about a Surprise Porsche Lifetime High
Spot--a visit to Gmund!

We were innocently boogying sount on the autbahn out of Salzburg in a '98
(excuse the expresion, but Dr. P did work for 'em) Mercedes-Benz E320 Wagon
with 4Matic, ESP (but not ESPN), a V-6, and really cool 17-inch alloys when
we spot this "Porsche Museum--Gmund" sign.  So ff we jump for a trip to
MECCA!  Helmut Pfeifenhofer's Lil' Wooden Porsche Museum is in this really
quaint lil' town in the middle of the Austrian Alps--complete with B&B next
door and a cool abandoned castle that would make a fantastic resort hotel
(already the kid is thinking).  No wonder Dr. P went down there to escape the
Late Unpleasantness.  Anyway, it got all dewy-eyed there for a minute or two,
just to be there where it all began!

I was tempted to scoop up a handful of dirt, but I didn't (demerits?).  The
museum is modest but great fun.  They have plenty of keen stuff--engines,
memorabilia from Dr. P's time with Daimler-Benz, Steyr, Wanderer, and more.
 Great old black and white historic photos of the early cars and plant.  A
couple of old winches and a water turbine he designed.  356-wise, they
display the wooden body buck for the Gmund coupean example of said coupe, and
right between them a tree trunk and Big Hammer that look suspiciously like
the metalshaping method employed.  There's also a 4-WD Volkswagen
(ex-Wehrmacht), Schwimmwagen, a Steyr, some 356 production cars, the 550 body
buck (wow!), a 906, 910, 959 rally car, 962, and a bunch of early posters.
 What a fantastic treat!

In the little store I found a cool book on Otto Mathe, but it's in German
(Peter A--wanna translate it?).  All in all, for a serious Porsche goofer of
30 years' standing, this short visit was a Lifetime Highlight!  A day I'll
always remember.  Maximum Recommendation for any Porsche enthusiast.  Do It!
