Hi fellow 356'ers,

Will soon be receiving a used twin grill luggage rack that I have purchased
through an ad in the 356 Registry. Will install on my "C" coupe.

I wonder if anyone can help with some questions I have regarding the racks:

    What is the exact hardware used to install the rack? Are standoffs used
to raise the rack off the grills? What about the bolts?

    What are the differences between painted and chrome racks (outside of the
obvious :-)?  Different manufacturers?  Were painted racks AND chrome racks
available and used on the "C" models?  What was the original finish of the
painted variety?  Gloss?  Color?

    What about luggage straps? Can they be purchased separately from a
vendor? What about ski carriers for the racks? Again are these available from
a vendor?

Sorry for the number of questions, but I'm sure there are some Luggage Rack
specialists out there!!

Thanks very much.
