Are there any Speedster owners who can confirm or deny the presence of engine
compartment sound deadener in their cars? 

Conventional wisdom used to be that Speedsters had no sound deadener, but I
don't think that's entirely correct. See the Nov/Dec. Registry, p. 32, bottom
photo. That's factory tarpaper sound deadener in a Carrera Speedster.

Could Speedster owners comment? Also, the giveaway for whether the car ever
had sound deadener is the presence of small screwholds around the edge of the
lid opening, on either side of the latch. The rearmost vertical panel was
wrapped over the edge and held in by a few sheetmetal screws and finishing
washers. 

It would be interesting to see how many cars which presently don't have sound
deadener still have the telltale holes. Did all Speedsters have sound
deadener? Some? None?
