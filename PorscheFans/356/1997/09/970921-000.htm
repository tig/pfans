I will be receiving a 67 912 engine in the next couple of weeks, and it is
my plan to sell it. I am told that it is in running condition complete with
carburettors, clutch, and all exhaust parts. It is said to have been
"rebuilt" with 5,000 miles on the rebuild. I cant say to what extent it was
"rebuilt", but receipts on the rebuild will accompany the engine. When it,
and the receipts arrive, I will know more. I have been told the engine is
worth $1200 to $1800 dollars, but I truly have no idea. Can anyone out
there help me establish a ball park high and low value for this engine? Is
anyone in the market for one of these? Is there a market for this engine?

Thankyou in advance!
