     Recently purchased my first 356 and I have a few questions.
      
     First, can anyone let me know what is required to start a Porsche 356A 
     (1956) which has not been started in 3 months. The fuel was drained 
     from the gas tank 3 months ago. The engine is a 1958 rebuilt 1600 
     engine. Do I have to do anyhting special or just wipe the inside of 
     the gas tank to remove any residue and then just add gas. 
     
     Secondly, Is there a particular type of octane that I should use for 
     the engine?
     
     Thirdly, the fuel cock leaks and needs to be rebuilt. Can this be done 
     by the average home mechanic? 
     
     Also, need some advice on why the transmission will not engage into 1 
     and 3 gear.  2 and 4 gear do engage. I was told that may they switched 
     the pins? inside the transmission when it was rebuilt. Any suggestions 
     would be appreciated.
     
     Also, looking for a work shop manual for this car. Not looking for a 
     new one. Can be a good used copy of the original work shop manual for 
     1956A years.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Rudy
