Michel,

Here's info on the proper formula for Aga Blue using modern Glasurit
paint:

The Aga Blue that Glasurit currently ships does not match the Aga Blue
found under the dash cover on my '67 912.  The shop working on my car
ended up ordering Aga Blue from Glasurit with the Lamp Black pigment
left out and added 383.9 grams of Lamp Black to the mixture to get a
very good match to the original color.

	Glasurit's original formula for Aga Blue:

		Pigment Code	Color		Total cumulative weight 
						of paint with the correct 
						amount of each pigment 
						added (grams)

		21M 56		Dark Blue	1475.2
		21M 26		Lamp Black	2451.8
		21M 59		Purple		3129.4
		21M 5		Ochre		3597.3
		21M 60		White		3985.9

	This formula lists the total weight of one gallon of paint
	after each pigment is added. The weight list after each
	pigment includes all the pigment that was added previously.
	That way the painter just puts the paint on a scale and adds
	each pigment in turn until the total weight matches that in
	the formula.  Based on that understanding of the formula,
	here's how I think the formula should be modified to yield
	an Aga Blue that matches the color under my car's dash
	cover (but don't trust it, please check my math!!!):


	Modified formula to match the original Aga Blue found
	on the dash of my '67 912:

		Pigment Code	Color		Total cumulative weight 
						of paint with the correct 
						amount of each pigment 
						added (grams)

		21M 56		Dark Blue	1475.2
		21M 59		Purple		2152.8
		21M 5		Ochre		2620.7
		21M 60		White		3009.3
		21M 26		Lamp Black	3393.2


If you'd like to take a look at the Aga Blue on a real car in person,
just let me know.  I'll steer you to the shop.  It's in San Jose,
California.  And if you would still like a color sample, please send
me your address; I'll be happy to send one to you.
