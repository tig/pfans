Burt -

If the starter won't turn over the engine when hot, it's not an
ignition problem.  Nor is it likely to be the ignition switch,
although we can't rule that out entirely.

Do you get a click or clunk from the starter when you hit the start
switch?  If you don't, that indicates a weak starter solenoid
and/or high resistance in the wiring that goes to the solenoid.
Sometimes it is the starter portion of the igintion switch.  But 
the ignition switch is fed by a jumper from the light switch, so
it could be weak terminals in that line, under the dash.

The best way to find a problem like this is by use of a voltmeter.
While holding the key in "start" position, look at the voltage at
various points in the circuit and see where the loss is.  Sometimes
it's just an accumulation of high resistance in several or all of 
the connectors.  That can be fixed by cleaning, re-tensioning or
replacing the connectors.  As a last resort, it could be the starter
switch itself.  Again, checking with a voltmeter is the best way to
find the culprit.  The ignition switch can be dis-mounted and held
slightly beneath the dash to get at the terminals.  A wiring diagram
helps to identify the wires by color.

If the solenoid does click but the starter doesn't turn over the 
engine, that suggests a weak starter or an engine that, for some
reason, is too hard to turn.  If you have replaced the starter with
solenoid, that would seem to eliminate that possibility.

Another possibility in this case is that the bushing in the trans
housing is too tight a fit on the end of the starter shaft.  Of 
course, this wouldn't happen as a result of wear, but if the bushing
has been replaced with one which isn't that right size, that could
be a possibility.  It has happened.  Of course, the bushings used with
the 12 volt starter are smaller, but enough smaller that a 6 volt 
starter shaft wouldn't fit in at all.

Keep one thing in mind.  The car originally started when hot, so it's
not a desperate situation.  The problem can be found and fixed.
Concentrate on electrical if the solenoid does not click, or 
mechanical if it does.

Get back to me on how you make out.
