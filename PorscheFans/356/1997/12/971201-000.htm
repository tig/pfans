My 1960 356 has developed the following fuel problem.  When it sits overnight
it starts with no problem what-so-ever.  However, when it sits over the
week-end I must pour gasoline down the throat of (only) one carb, it does not
matter which, to get it to start. It is as if the gasoline has evaporated
 from the fuel chambers. The carbs have both been rebuilt and are in top
shape.  This problem has my  independent shop owner and me baffled.  I live
in the San Francisco Bay area and we are wondering if others in the Bay area
might be having this problem which would point to the new highly volitale
gasoline which has come on the market in the last year or so.  
I drive the car every day and have no other problems with it.  It runs like
the proverbial top.  We are toying with the idea of installing a electric
fuel pump but I would rather keep it 100% stock. Any and all ideas will be
appreciated.
