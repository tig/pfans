I'll try to keep this tale short, while giving the basic symptoms.
	I autocross Tubbie, my 1961 B coupe, in the summers.  Otherwise, it is
used infrequently (when I feel the need to smile).  In July after an
autocross, I returned to my hotel, had just switched off the ignition -
when BANG, the battery exploded.  After some very good samaritans helped
push Tubbie up onto my trailer, we all surmised that my misfortune was
probably due to the combination of hot day, racing, and an old car.
	A couple of months later: new battery installed and front end cleaned
thoroughly, and the car just won't start!  I have checked the obvious
(fuses, switched voltage regulators), but cannnot seem to find the
problem.
	Any help would be appreciated, but bear in mind that I am electrically
challanged, so you'll have to spell it out very clearly.  Thanks in
advance.   John Hayman@seidata.com
