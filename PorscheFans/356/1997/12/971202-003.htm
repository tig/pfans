My '67 912 is my first Porsche I have had it about 4 and a half months now
and I am in Love.  Sure, a couple of more cylinders wouldn't hurt, but I
love anyway.  The synchros in first gear are dead  and the paint has
spiderwebbed over about forty percent of the car but, until tonight in the
parking lot at work, the body was straight and damn fine to look at.  Some
clown backed into my right   front bumper/quarter panel.  Smashing the side
of the turn signal, pulling the wrap around part of the bumper down and away
from the quarter panel tin, the quarter panel itself buckled out a bit at
the top of the wheel well and in a bit at the front bottom of the Q panel
near the the bumper wrap around.  I am Crushed. 
I got the pertinant info from the other driver and  she works in the same
building.  I plan to contact her insurance tomorrow, but I feel as if I am
in shock.    
        Anybody have suggestiions about where to get the work done in the
Southern Willamette valley (Albany, Corvallis, Eugene), Oregon?  Should I
let the repair people try to hammer it out or demand a new Quarter panel?
and if I want a new quarter panel how do I get her insurance to pay for it.
The damage isn't terrible put it is apparent.  How should a body shop and or
a n insurance company approach the repair job and or bill?

        Thanks
