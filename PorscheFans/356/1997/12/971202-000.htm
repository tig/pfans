John-

The mystery of the evaporating gasoline is affecting most carbureted
cars these days.  I have it on an old Mercedes.  Must have something 
to do with increased volatility.  If you find out, let me know.

However, even with empty carbs the fuel pump should get gas to the
carbs within about 5 to 10 seconds of cranking.  If not, there's
probably a leak in the suction side.  That is, between the tank and
the inlet of the fuel pump.

By far the most likely spot is the flexible piece of fuel line that
goes from the chassis (under the car) up to the engine.  If this 
is the German fuel hose which is like braided cloth on the outside,
it cracks after just a few years.

If it were my car I would replace that piece of fuel line NOT with
more of the awful German stuff but with a length of regular American
fuel line, 5/16" size, from any auto parts store.  This fits
perfectly over the 8 mm metal fuel line ends.

That should get the pump pulling gas within a few seconds of cranking.
If not, better check the pump itself for good suction.  The diaphragm
may be cracked.

The thing about these leaks on the suction side is that they don't
usually let gas leak out.  Air is pulled in through a crack in the
flexible line, but gas does not escape, so you are not made aware
of a "gas leak" by the smell or a puddle of gasoline.

Let me know how you make out.
