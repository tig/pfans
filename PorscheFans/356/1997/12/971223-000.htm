Hi P-fans,

I recently put up a web site for Porsche fans to get together and chat.  =
I had posted the announcement on all the lists but recently was informed =
that only my 911 posts got sent due to not being subscribed to all the =
lists.  I have reattached the previous messages for your reading.   The =
site is growing everyday.  I have introduced contests and have plans for =
a vendors page and an e-mail directory of p-fans.  Please by all means =
surf on over and check out the site.  let me know of any suggestions you =
may have
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
I was thinking I might set up a web site where p-fans from everywhere =
could get together on a web based chat forum to talk in real time about =
interests, events, problems, and concerns. I would also like to have a =
links list of all who participate in this digest. With locations and =
e-mail and url address. There would also be an archive of previous =
digest issues on line for people to browse for any missed information. =
If anyone thinks this would be a good idea and would be interested in =
such a site please let me know on the digest or e-mail me. I wouldn't =
want to put up this site if it was in vain. I look forward to your =
input.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----------------------

A few days back, I mentioned that I was planning to put up a web site =
where people from this mailing list could get together and chat about =
repairs, experiences etc
Well the site is up!. It's called the Porsche Fans Lounge. I have set up =
a test site for now. The site is done in frames. The chat room is up and =
running. The room is linked up with another room for now so there is =
traffic there. I will be demerging the room in 1 weeks time. The=20
chat program is pretty versatile. You can change your text color,=20
include a picture. The refresh rate is quick and is easy to use. The=20
e-mailer and main page are also up. The links page needs some=20
additional links, if you want yours put there e-mail me with it. The=20
archives, and pictures pages have to be set up. I do have to make some =
finishing touches though. Please check it out, make any suggestions.  =
Hopefully We can make this site a place to get together to socialize and =
hav e good time!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------------
In reference to the site I have created called "The Lounge"
.. I am looking for someone to do weekly editorials about topics of=20
interest. Things like new models, repairs, experiences, events etc. So =
if you think you have something to say here's your chance. E-mail=20
me...... or go directly to the site and read the notice in the archives =
page. =20

have a good time. Here is the URL

I own a new shop called Trackside Products in San Diego. We've got a lot of
356 owners here (including myself). Another of our local shops (Personalized
Autohaus) is owned by a guy named Wayne Baker. Wayne probably needs no
introduction to most 356'ers. He's involved in vintage racing and has bought
several sets of BF Goodrich Comp T/A R1 tires in a 185/70-15. I have an oven
to heat cycle tires, which we did to these. 

The tire has worked extremely well both for track and street use. Wayne
recently drove a 356 from San Diego to Oregon and back. The driveability of
the tire in rain was excellent. That the tire was "fun" goes without saying.
We're waiting for some tires to wear out so we can more accurately determine
how much the heat cycling has decreased tread wear.

I have these tires available for sale if anyone is interested. Shipping is
free for non- heat clycled tires and would probably cost $7-10 for heat
cycled. Shaving is also available.

Does anyone out there have another tire that they have used successfully.
Since I sell tires I'm trying to learn more from the people using them rather
than from the people trying to sell them to me.

Any information is welcome.
