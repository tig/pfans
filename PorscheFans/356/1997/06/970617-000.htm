Would anyone happen to know how I can rent/beg/borrow a 911
or 356 cabriolet around Sept. in the Portland OR area (suitably
compensated, natch)?  A 550 Spyder would be best, but I might
have more trouble locating one of those..... =8^)

I need the car to use for driving off to the reception after
a wedding, and for taking some pictures before/after the
wedding.  So, probably for a total of about 4-6hrs.

Originally, we had planned to use the 914/6 I've been working on,
but it doesn't look like the car will be finished in time, and I'm
not too inclined to push around the car during the wedding.. =8^)

Any leads would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Mike

P.S.  A couple of buddies have already graciously offered the
use of their 914's, but sadly, I must say "no" to 914's because
it would not be *my* 914!  The frauline would be jealous....
