<<Subject: Sending units

I'm adding a full flow filter and external oil cooler to my '68 912 and 
removing the bypass oil filter. Will I get accurate oil temp & pressure 
readings>>

I'd say it'd be well worth your while to have the set-up tested with some
external gauges before you really put this 912 on the road.
Were you getting some hi temps with the stock set-up? The maechanic I WAS
using had been putting the wrong sive filter in my 69 912 resulting in some
very high temps. I took over the oil and filter change opperation myself and
have been running right in the middle of the gauge since. Verify that you are
using the right filter also.
