My thanks to all the folks who responded to my question as to whether to =
fix up my 912 in order to sell it.  The general concensus seemed to be =
that I should sell it as is and let the new owner decide for him/herself =
what to do with it.  So, here are the details:

1969 912.  Engine rebuilt by previous owner, about 20,000 miles ago.  =
Mechanically, the car is in good shape, has rebuilt Solex carbs and 5 =
speed trans.  The body is pretty straight except for the right front =
fender and a small dent in the front bumper.  The doors have some rust =
but I have another good set of doors that are included with the car.  =
Interior:  Sports seats (have the original seat also), driver's side has =
a couple of tears, passenger side is in okay condition.  Door panels are =
and carpeting are in pretty good shape.  Headliner needs to be replaced. =
 Dash is cracked but I have a new dash that is mint.  Momo steering =
wheel.  I'm asking $3,750 which I think is a pretty fair price.  The car =
is in Los  Angeles.
