    I just wanted to thank those who helped me figure out that I had
received the wrong generator when I sent mine in for rebuild.  It seems
as though I received a GR11X, 6-volt VW generator.  I'd also like to
point out that I am happy that the vendor corrected the problem with no
additional cost to me by providing me with a Bosch, factory-rebuilt
generator.  My guess is that the company took a loss on this particular
sale.

    I think it is important for me to mention that the company was
Automotion.  They handled the problem exceptionally well and have earned
the trust of one more customer.  I certainly will be more inclined to
throw money their way when I need parts in the future.
