Hank,
I have to add a bit:
I've owned a white 1969 912 since 1985, and drove it as is until 1993. I 
restored it (bare metal resto. in 1993 that took almost 2 years of my spare 
time/weekends etc...) This is where the car got interesting, I thought it 
was fun until I started autocrossing with PCA (Roadrunner region). Since 
then I've improved the car for autocrossing, and drive it often on the 
street (not quite daily) and you know what... It's become a BLAST. Yes it's 
a lot of elbow grease,a nd time, but I can truly say I enjoy 99.99% of every 
minute. The car is faster than a lot of 911's in autocross events. (If only 
I could say that of the driver ... but that's another story.)
Chris
