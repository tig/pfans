A few notes while we are on the topic...

1)	The P-901 (the 4 spoke early engine yoke) is not ideal for later
engines.  Re: There's no cut out for one of the DME sensors and the
factory claims that  the early yoke is not strong enough.  Also the
early yoke  appears to not be able to accommodate a dual mass flywheel.
On the upside I've had no trouble mounting my '96 993 motor w/o the
flywheel to the stand (I'm preparing .  For those of you putting
3.6liter engine in earlier cars (not using the dual mass flywheel) you
can get away with the cheaper earlier yoke.  You can buy the early and
later yokes from Braun Tools, I can give you contact information if you
are interesting in buying a yoke).

2)	The fit into a standard cheap-o engine stand (the type you buy
at CostCo) isn't completely optimal.  As you tilt the engine over, it
pivots on the stand as you would expect.  However there's a gap between
the flange on the yoke-shaft and the inboard edge of engine stand's
holder tube within which the yoke shaft is inserted, also note that the
engine is slightly angled upwards away from the stand...  As you rotate
the engine on the stand this gap reduces due to gravity.   Thus the
retaining pin holes on the yoke and the engine stand no longer align up.
Lifting the engine with a jack allows you to readjust the alignment of
the pin holes.  The long term fix is to use a spacer collar to fix this
problem (I plan to make one up on my lathe).

3)	For transmission jacks, I really like the Wudel creeper style
jack.  It's a little pricey but has a terrific range and is very easy to
use.  "Jacks" in Seattle sells them locally.  I do not suggest buying
the Porsche or VW adapter plate. re: I've never gotten either of them to
work correctly, just use two chunks of ¾ inch plywood mounted to the
standard plate works great (I can give you the dimensions).  Some people
add carpet to the plywood plate to give a better grip and trap oil
drips, I found this reduces the life span of the plate due to moisture.
On the Wudel jack I recommend you buy the lever style control/adjustment
handle.  The knob sticks and in hard to control (the one on my jack
actually stripped out).

		(continuing the cross-post on the chance that someone
may get something out of this.)

		I am borrowing an engine stand from a friend (Thanks,
Scott!!!). It is a combination of an inexpensive standard engine stand
and the P-901 (is that right?) Porsche engine yoke. The cylindrical
mount of the yoke fits perfectly into the engine stand. So, don't buy
the whole German engine stand, just buy the yoke and use a less
expensive stand.

		I also borrowed a transmission jack (Thanks, Leeds!!!)
which really eased the engine/transmission removal process. I attached
the yoke to the engine while it was still on the jack after removing the
tranny. The jack was able to lift the engine high enough to reach the
yoke mounting hole on the stand upright.

		I must say that having the engine on the stand make it a
real pleasure to work on. This is the first time I have adjusted 911
valves and I can't imagine what a hassle it must be to do it in the car.
And, no, I didn't pull the engine to adjust the valves. The tranny is
getting rebuilt and I am installing a new clutch and SSI headers. I
can't wait to get this car back together!

			(sorry for the crossposting, but I'm hoping
there's some cross-experience
			out here.  I'm not on the 356 list, so I'd
appreciate direct email from
			you guys.)

			Wel, it didn't take long for me to break down
and want to buy a 911
			engine stand..... =8^)
			With that in mind, does anyone have an Upfixin'
index (yep, that's
			on the buy list too) and can tell me which
volume has the article
			on building an engine stand.
			Also, does anyone know if the engine stand yoke
to actually hold
			the engine is interchange-able between all
Porsche air-cooled engines?
			A local parts place out here has an engine yoke
(with the semi-circle
			brace) that's made for VW T1 and 356 engines.
The counter dude said
			he thought it also handled VW T4 and 914
engines, though he didn't
			know about 911 engines.  I figured if the 914
and 911 (at least the
			2.4 I have) bolt up to the same 901 tranny, that
what would work for
			one should work for the other.  But I want to
make sure, as the
			yoke would not be returnable if I were to buy
it.....

			And while I'm at it (there seem to be many
ingenious people on these
			list), can anyone suggest a good way of lifting
a fully dressed 911
			engine onto a stand w/o a cherry picker?  I'd
like to get one someday,
			but I don't have the room right now.  I had
thought about using the
			tracks which hold up the garage door and some
come-alongs, but I could
			seem them start to buckle as I began the lift,
so I backed off.....

			Thanks,
			Mike
