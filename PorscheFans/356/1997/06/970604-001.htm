(sorry for the crossposting, but I'm hoping there's some cross-experience
out here.  I'm not on the 356 list, so I'd appreciate direct email from
you guys.)

Wel, it didn't take long for me to break down and want to buy a 911
engine stand..... =8^)
With that in mind, does anyone have an Upfixin' index (yep, that's
on the buy list too) and can tell me which volume has the article
on building an engine stand.
Also, does anyone know if the engine stand yoke to actually hold
the engine is interchange-able between all Porsche air-cooled engines?
A local parts place out here has an engine yoke (with the semi-circle
brace) that's made for VW T1 and 356 engines.  The counter dude said
he thought it also handled VW T4 and 914 engines, though he didn't
know about 911 engines.  I figured if the 914 and 911 (at least the
2.4 I have) bolt up to the same 901 tranny, that what would work for
one should work for the other.  But I want to make sure, as the
yoke would not be returnable if I were to buy it.....

And while I'm at it (there seem to be many ingenious people on these
list), can anyone suggest a good way of lifting a fully dressed 911
engine onto a stand w/o a cherry picker?  I'd like to get one someday,
but I don't have the room right now.  I had thought about using the
tracks which hold up the garage door and some come-alongs, but I could
seem them start to buckle as I began the lift, so I backed off.....

Thanks,
Mike
