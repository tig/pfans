Hank,
I have to add a bit:
I've owned a white 1969 912 since 1985, and drove it as is until 1993. I 
restored it (bare metal resto. in 1993 that took almost 2 years of my spare 
time/weekends etc...) This is where the car got interesting, I thought it 
was fun until I started autocrossing with PCA (Roadrunner region). Since 
then since I've improved the car for autocrossing, and drive it often on the 
street (not quite daily) and you know what... It's become a BLAST. Yes it's 
a lot of elbow grease,a nd time, but I can truly say I enjoy 99.99% of every 
minute. The car is faster than a lot of 911's in autocross events. (If only 
I I could say that of the driver ... but that's another story.)
