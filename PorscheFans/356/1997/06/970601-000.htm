Hello again,

Thanks again to all who had suggestions or stories about the installation of
the chrome exhaust extensions.

I evaluated all suggestions including the one to "forget it" and discovered
that I wasn't going to be able to force fit them into the bumper guards
without destroying the funnels (which I just sandblasted and painted). This
is what I came up with. I cut an "L" shape out of the chrome extension on the
top side of the oval end (end that goes into the bumper guard) and then was
very easily able to force fit the extension into the hole with no destruction
of the funnel. It actually surrounds the funnel on the bottom and buts
against the top part of the funnel. The cutoff section is entirely inside the
bumper guard and cannot be seen. The extension sticks out about 1.5 to 2
inches and looks great. They are in very snugly and do not move at all.

Thanks again,
Bob Soldani
