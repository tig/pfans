(continuing the cross-post on the chance that someone may get something
out of this.)

I am borrowing an engine stand from a friend (Thanks, Scott!!!). It is a
combination of an inexpensive standard engine stand and the P-901 (is
that right?) Porsche engine yoke. The cylindrical mount of the yoke fits
perfectly into the engine stand. So, don't buy the whole German engine
stand, just buy the yoke and use a less expensive stand.

I also borrowed a transmission jack (Thanks, Leeds!!!) which really
eased the engine/transmission removal process. I attached the yoke to
the engine while it was still on the jack after removing the tranny. The
jack was able to lift the engine high enough to reach the yoke mounting
hole on the stand upright.

I must say that having the engine on the stand make it a real pleasure
to work on. This is the first time I have adjusted 911 valves and I
can't imagine what a hassle it must be to do it in the car. And, no, I
didn't pull the engine to adjust the valves. The tranny is getting
rebuilt and I am installing a new clutch and SSI headers. I can't wait
to get this car back together!
