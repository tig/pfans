Anyone have some ideas? I have run out of causes for my ailing 912.  The
symptoms: 

	At idle it varies around 1000 rpm and has an erratic "miss"
resulting in a drop of 200 rpm for a moment. This miss seems to occur
only after warm up.

	At off idle (2000-3000 rpm) it stumbles during acceleration

	At highway speed (3800 rpm) power "seems" o.k. until you
accelerate, at which time it hesitates very noticeably.  Also, at this
speed a slow and consistant harmonic vibration occurs which is
definately from the engine, not the drive train

The things I've checked and re-checked include:

	fuel: overhauled pump, blew-out/rebuilt solexes, set float
level, adjusted accel. pump to 0.55 ml, syncronized throats, checked for
manifold/carb base leaks, tuned up

	ignition: installed/adj. 050 Distributor (made no diff), plugs
have normal brownish appearance, good strong spark (arcs 1/2" to ground)

	engine: compression is good (160,160,155,145), heads were
completely rebuilt by Compitition Engineering (CE) 4000 miles ago,
valves are adjusted to spec

I'm very familiar with my car, having done my own work for 9 years so I
don't think I've missed the obvious.  To cut to the chase, I think the
problem may be with the muffler because of the idle miss after warm-up
and the perculiar harmonic vibration at speed.  Also, after the CE
re-build, I installed the engine and mistakenly swapped spark wires
which caused a loud ( no explosive backfire) which may have damaged the
muffler. I suppose the other possibility is worn carb shafts, but they
worked fine prior to the CE head rebuild.

So, what do you think?  Are these symptoms consistant with a plugged or
leaky exhaust? Is there a way to test the exhaust theory w/o simply
replacing it?  I would really appreciate your opinion.  Thanks, Greg
