So, now we all have at least one reason to be optimistic about
government.

Don't get too comfortable Greg.  The only reason that this legislation was
passed was because a very imposing new Smog program was being implemented in
parts of N. Cal. that set new standards that older cars couldn't have met
when they were new.  

A Norcal conservative talk radio station started getting calls from people
about the beta testing and the fact that their cars were being lableled
"gross polluters" and were subject to being seized and crushed and the
resulting "pollution credits" sold to industrial polluters il lieu of
reducing their pollutants. Thr radio station crusaded against this program
and the crusade continues.   

After a year and a protest that drew 5000+ to the state house, the
government threw us a bone.  This was done because many of the protestors
were car club members, usually collector car types.  This is NOT an example
of a wise, benevolent bureacracy making an intelligent decision.  Rather it
is the result of the aggressive work and action of thousands of concerned
(acually enraged is a more apt description) citizens rallying against
irrational, bureacratically driven programs.......

I'll get off the soapbox now......
