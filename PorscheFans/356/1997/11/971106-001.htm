Greg,

	Sounds like fuel starving, and you seem to have checked just 
about all of the obvious sources, but you didn't mention fuel filters 
(one in tank, one in engine compartment) in your missive.  Don't know if 
you just didn't mention, or haven't checked this yet.  Another 
possibility is a clogged charcoal cannister (don't know if '68 912s had 
these) or a clogged fuel tank vent (do you hear a hiss when removing the 
fuel cap after driving a half hour or so?).

Anyway, just a few more obvious, inexpensive things to try before you try 
tearing down the Solexes.

Good luck,

>         At idle it varies around 1000 rpm and has an erratic "miss"

> 
>         At off idle (2000-3000 rpm) it stumbles during acceleration
> 
>         At highway speed (3800 rpm) power "seems" o.k. until you

> The things I've checked and re-checked include:
> 
>         fuel: overhauled pump, blew-out/rebuilt solexes, set float
> level, adjusted accel. pump to 0.55 ml, syncronized throats, checked for
> manifold/carb base leaks, tuned up
> 
>         ignition: installed/adj. 050 Distributor (made no diff), plugs
> have normal brownish appearance, good strong spark (arcs 1/2" to ground)
> 
>         engine: compression is good (160,160,155,145), heads were
> completely rebuilt by Compitition Engineering (CE) 4000 miles ago,
> valves are adjusted to spec
>
