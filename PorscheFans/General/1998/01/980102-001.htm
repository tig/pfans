well, looks like i'm getting a new car.  a 73 with turbo flares and 8&9x15
fuchs.  i'm gonna be mightily broke for a while, so i won't be able to
afford two sets of wheels (i don't know how i'd ever afford another set of
8s & 9s...).  i want a set of tires that will work everywhere--autocross,
driver's ed, and street, including rainy days--since it's going to be my
only car.

the only tire i can see that will do the job is the yokohama A302. 
they're stickier than street tires, but they have real tread, and they
last a good long time.  i've heard they're pretty noisy, anyone want to
confirm or deny?  any other comments on the A302's, i'd especially like to
hear from someone who's used them.

any other recomendations for multiple use rubber?

more news on the car itself once it's actually in my garage...
