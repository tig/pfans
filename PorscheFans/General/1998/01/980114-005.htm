Scott,

	Thanks for answering my e-mail, I'm new at this list stuff and I didn´t
know if my messages where getting to it OK.
	About your comments, I agree that Porsche can produce any kind o
vehicle, but the SUV market has been created and dominated by
experienced Americans companys, they have a great "know-how" on it. If
Porsche wants to get into this market, at least in the beginnig, it
should associate with some company which knows what is doing, so they
won´t have to pass through many stages in the hard way. I think that is
not a choice to get a partner... it´s a necessity! Like Porsche has
always "worked to other companies", it's time to be a little humble and
ask for assistance while still some time. Get someone that really knows
the stuff, show them what you want and if it's the right thing to do, go
for it. But we have to see that we are stepping on a new ground and we
are not used to it. "Prudence" is the word that has to be in mind. I
don't want to see my passion with the kind of trouble that Mercedes is
in (A Class turn over).
