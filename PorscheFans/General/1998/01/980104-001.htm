<<well, looks like i'm getting a new car.  a 73 with turbo flares and
8&9x15
fuchs.  i'm gonna be mightily broke for a while, so i won't be able to
afford two sets of wheels (i don't know how i'd ever afford another set
of
8s & 9s...).  i want a set of tires that will work
everywhere--autocross,
driver's ed, and street, including rainy days--since it's going to be my
only car.

the only tire i can see that will do the job is the yokohama A302. 
they're stickier than street tires, but they have real tread, and they
last a good long time.  i've heard they're pretty noisy, anyone want to
confirm or deny?  any other comments on the A302's, i'd especially like
to
hear from someone who's used them.

any other recomendations for multiple use rubber?

more news on the car itself once it's actually in my garage...>>

Hi Dirk,

Congratulations!

I've used Yokohama A008Rs and BFG R1s on the street for years. Both are
fine and I really like having the extra safety margin if things suddenly
get interesting. I even took my 951S skiing (literally) a couple weeks
ago when I drove it to Mt. Snow with used R1s. Anything short of that
they are just fine.

I'd stay away from Hoosiers on the street (Hooters if you are Scotty B.
White). They are reputed to have very thin walls. Speaking of Scotty,
I'll beat him to the punch and tell you that Kumhos would be a better
choice than A302s.

I've heard from everybody that the A302s are very noisy on the street.
They are great in the rain but they are slower than the other
performance tires in dry conditions.

Enjoy the new car,

Paul Foster
