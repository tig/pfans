So far, I have not seen anyone carrying a hatchet. This is a Porsche list
and it is fair to talk about Dr. Porsche and what happened to him after
WW2 was over. It is even fair to talk about his role in the German War
Machine. What we don't need here is some yahoo making judgmental
statements about Germany, Germans, or people "employed" by the Germans
during WWII. So far, this has not happened.

History will always be discussed in a free society and that is a good
thing. It is important to know where you have been as a race (in this
case, human race) so you know what to avoid in the future. Let's stick to
Porsche history here please....
