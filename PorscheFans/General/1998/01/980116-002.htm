P-fans
        =20
        I'm looking for some advise on rear end noise I'm experiencing =
from my 1981 931.  It makes this terrible clicking noise when in gear =
and the axle under any load.  I believe its the same axle as the early =
944s.  First thing that comes in to mind is them CV joints. =20
=20
        So I took my 931 to European Auto Service in city of Walnut (in =
southern Calif.) who said CVs need to be repacked, but also the rear =
bearings are bad-- but they did rear wheel bearings 15 months (15k) ago! =
 They charged me like $500 for that and its no longer under 12 month =
warranty!
        =20
    I also asked them to look into my morning smoke I've seen and they =
said that it needed CO adjustment which they did.  But now my car has =
very little power, hesitates, and poor throttle response.  It felt like =
my timing wasn't advancing. My 931 was had good power and response =
before this.  Please advise...
=20
        I took the car back today and they said come back in a few weeks =
for more CO adj and rear noise fix (CV joint repack and take apart rear =
wheel bearings to see if it needs replacement~ $400 labor only+ parts)  =
I felt screwed.
=20
        Needless to say "European Auto Service" in Walnut, CA is no =
longer my shop of choice.  Does any P-fans have recommendations via past =
experience for a reliable real P-car shop located in So. Calif?
=20
Any advise on 924-944 rear end noise,  Engine CO/timing adjustment, =
and/or good knowledgeable P-car shop would be appreciated.
=20
TIA
