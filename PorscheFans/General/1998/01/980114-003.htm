Daniel,
	I think these two things are completely different. When Porsche or any
other company puts its name on other kind of products (like t-shirts,
coats, perfumes, key-racks, hats) that are not their speciality, this
company is using these products to spread their brand with fans or any
person who thinks that is nice to have a brand on their chest. This is
used to spread the brand and not to get money directely. It's an
indorssement, the company is not manufacturing the good, the only thing
it does is verify the quality of these goods, so that they don´t hurt
the brand. To build Montain Bikes is necessary a kind of tecnology that
Porsche doesn't have for now (I'm not saying that Porsche doesn't have
the capacity to build them), some of these bikes uses compounds and
structures that are only seen in space-crafts. So what Porsche does?
Association! They develop the project together with some company that is
used with this product! So if the product is not good, they just take
their name off it or just leave the things in the same, because.... it's
not their speciality any way! In some cases, it cannot hurt the brand!
	That what they should be doing with the SUV's: not taking risks! The
Porsche brand builds sports cars and not SUV's, it´s too risky to do
things that you are not used to. Let's use another name and Porsche
gives indorssement, keeping it's name one step above the others like
always have been! (Except that little thing about building popular cars
in China a few years ago. Does anyone remember? I'd like to know what
happend since then...)
