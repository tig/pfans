to my knowledge there are NO current fonts that PCA itself uses... just a logo
art.  thats why I've been working on reproducing the PORSCHE font as well as
the Boxster name script... and maybe somewheres along the line tackle the older
model fonts... like those used on the 924/944... the 928 also... the 968 is the
same as the Boxster name script as is the new/old Carrera logo's... when i'm
done i'll inform the lists here on how to get hold of em.

if the demand is high enuff dont be surprised if i charge say 20bux for the
whole shebang...
