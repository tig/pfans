Forrest,

Yes, I also have been thinking about this for a while.  As you know the
"independence" of area is an approximation and according to my old
schoolbook it is not good approximation for rubber and plastic material.

I haven't met anyone who has been able to answer this question to my
satisfaction ... maybe someone here on the list can (hope so)

But, as you know from various motorsports ie. Drag racing and Formula 1
racing.  The racers like to have the tires hot.  This indicates that warmer
rubber is stickier ... therefore more road friction but, that doesn't
explain the physics behind wider tires (or does it?, because sticky things
are dependent on area)

Best regards
Runar

So much for theory.  Can some kind soul share the real physics behind this?

Thanks!
Forrest
