Some notes on switching to wider tires.  Hopefully my fellow mechanical
engineers will forgive that I'm going to speak from experience rather
than from my textbooks.

1.  Switching to sticky wider tires usually is accompanied by a decrease
in sidewall height - most people go +1 or +2 on diameter as well.  This
has a large effect on tire compliance - the ability of the tire to
maintain grip during transitions.  On a smooth track or on the smoother
streets of warmer locales, this only helps performance as the car takes
a 'set' in the turn faster and more predictably.  Steady state,
at-the-limit cornering is more predictable as well.  But on an old bumpy
track or in Pennsylvania, this sticky tire's limit of adhesion, while
high in steady state, is quickly exceeded by the rapid weight
transitions caused by bumps.  The tire also has a harder time regaining
grip because of this lack of compliance.  Don't go for 19" wheels in
Chicagoland!

2.  Obviously you can switch to wider tires without switching wheel
diameters;  with the right aspect ratio your sidewall heights don't
change much.  But it's still possible to not gain much on performance. 
A wider tire is much more susceptible to incorrect tire pressures and
bad alignments.  Bottom line is, for cornering speed to improve with
wider tires, you need to dial in both of these factors so you present
this big wide contact patch squarely on the road while in the corner. 
When I was at TrueSports in the 80's, for road courses we ran over 4
degrees of front negative camber on the Indy cars, which had a much more
racing-friendly suspension than any road car does.  That was what it
took to take advantage of that wide contact patch, along with careful
maintenance of tire pressures.

3.  There's a limit to how wide you ought to put on a given car.  A 200
horsepower 3000 pound car doesn't need more than a 255mm wide tire,
unless maybe Senna's clone is driving.  For hard driving, you want to
get some heat in the tires - you'll never do it unless you are causing
them to slide somewhat.  You won't get them to slide without a certain
level of both horsepower and weight.  I remember an 85-ish Celica GTS in
Stock 7 (I think) when I was running Pro Solo, and 100 or so horsepower
just wasn't enough to get heat into the big 235's he had on the car's
stock 7x15 rims.

4.  Another observation on sidewall heights would be that during a given
year Formula 1 races have been won by teams running 13" wheels and by
teams running 15" wheels.  The teams with 13" wheels (and the tall tire
sidewalls) would do well at the bumpy and street tracks, and the teams
with 15" wheels (and stiffer sidewalls) would do well at the smooth and
fast tracks.

5.  AND...  Drag racing tires are preposterously wide, but that's only
when they are standing still.  They've got big, floppy, patented, top
secret, magic sidewalls that are designed only for compliance and for
winding up like a rubber band at launch.  That first 5g launch is done
with tall, relatively narrow tires.  But I don't like drag racing...

Be smooth!
