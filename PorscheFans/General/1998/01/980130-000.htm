Regarding Mr. Porsche during WW II this remark. Yes, I think he was
quite naive in his work. But all engineers during (and before) the war
were quite naive. They were investigating and trying new techniques and
were very much doing the same as now e.g. scientist investigating
cloning. Scientists/engineers were and are most of the time a-political
and doing their research. However, some research is extremely dangerous,
unethical or very political.
Ferdinand Porsche was building cars for ALL the people of Germany; who
could disagree?? As far as I know Ferdinand was 'friends' with the
Nazis, but they happened to be the ruling government at that time. In a
recent BBC-series (excellent) it was proven that almost all the germans
at that time cooperated with the government, because it was the
government and if you didn't cooperate, they knew how to find you (or
the neighbours). 
Ferdinand was put in jail for some months aftre the war in France,
because of his extreme naivity towards the german army and government.
To resume, yes, I think you are right that you can't blame the son for
the sins of the father. I don't look back. We should never forget
however. For one thing I'm convinced the same could happen all over
again (look at Yugoslavia). Let's hope it doesn't.
I drive Porsche with pleasure (924/944). I can do that because someone
invented this magnificent car!

Best greetings,
Lucas Hartong.
