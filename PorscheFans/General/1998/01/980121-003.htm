Downward force IS a function of weight (here on earth, anyway) and can =
be expressed in PSI (pounds per square inch), but in an automobile, =
there are also lateral stresses that cause an increase in applied force. =
This is demonstrated everytime you turn a car. The weight (or inertia) =
is transferred to the outside wheels, the car rolls, the sidewalls flex, =
as the force increases.

Surface 'area' is just that, as measured by width and length. Hence a =
wider tire WILL cause surface area to increase. Air pressure only helps =
the tires support the vehicle weight, as well as maintain tire shape. =
Increasing air pressure will cause the tire to become more round, =
reducing the contact area. Just let the air out of your tires and =
observe what happens for a demonstration.

An increase in surface area actually causes there to be less PSI =
delivered. (Weight/Area) Try changing from skinny tires to wide tires on =
a wet surface for a demonstration of this.

So, why does everyone want wider tires? The ansewr is not friction. =
(resistance to motion) but one of 'stiction'. Believe it or not that IS =
an actual technical term for the force required to initiate 'friction'. =
'Stiction' is a function of surface area and weight, which is why we use =
rubber tires, and racers prefer soft composites on hard surfaces. Since =
tires are supple, they can conform to the road surface, thereby =
increasing contact surface area.

For a better description of 'stiction', check out a mechanical =
engineering textbook sometime.

This isn't meant as a 'flame' by any means, as I have pondered the same =
question.
(I know, I know, time to find a hobby!)

 When you did that experiment, there was only friction of two hard surfaces, a
 tire also has mechanical grip on the pavement, the relatively soft rubber and
 the rough pavement actually interlock giving better traction. If this were
not
 the case, drag racers wouldn't be able to accelerate as hard as they do.

Exactly.  There is also the matter of adhesion, which is the reason racing
tires get sticky.  Pure friction, as in the example Forrest gave, is only a
small piece of the entire picture.  Physics is generally about "pure" science,
and the real world is rarely pure!
