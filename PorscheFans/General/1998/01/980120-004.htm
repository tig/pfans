May I suggest that you post your query to the 928 list?

928@PorscheFans.com

I suspect that someone on that list besides myself may be able to give
you some advise.  It would also help if your email address got posted
along with your query - that way some one can email you directly.

Now, on to your query: if every thing is wrong with your a/c system
that _they_ _say_ is wrong - then yes, it's probably not an
unreasonable estimate; 928 parts are expensive.

However, I strongly suggest that you find a knowledgeable 928 mechanic
to diagnose the problem and based upon posts about dealers on the 928
list that mechanic should not be working for a Porsche dealer.  The
928 list members can help you find a good mechanic in your area.  They
may even be able to help you diagnose and fix the problem yourself.
