Dear  Tim C

I am curious.  Lets say that you designed a widget for a company that wanted
1% of a specific widget market, and if you altered it slightly, you also could
enter and profit millions from that same widget market.  Does a business grow
if it is not willing to change and adapt to a changing world market?  You are
correct in saying "Do what you do best and do what you have been doing well".
But there is not much difference between a 2 door automobile and a 4 door
automobile, nor is there a lot of diference between a all wheel drive 911
turbo and a lifted 1986 959 in rally form.   Do you know what a jacked up 928
is with 4 wheel drive and 4 doors is called?  Its a SUV.  Vorstand might still
shoot such a project down, but on the other hand.  Would you toss a $100 bill
out the window of your porsche?  Of course driving a 76 RSR and a 93 RSA,
maybe you can afford to.

Dear Alan,

     I appreciate your response to my post.  Concerning the Windward issue, I
guess you should know  we have a mutual friend, who shall remain nameless ( to
protect the friendship) and he claims you are a really nice guy, however
sometimes you have unrealistic expectations.  Well, I don't know about that,
as I do not know you . . . and I refuse to get into a P----ng contest with
you.   But, I will relate to you a story which you should find interesting, as
I believe you mentioned chips and chassis dynos in your post.

     Through our mutual friend (who will eternally remain nameless) I took my
car down to a place in Dayton Ohio called Howe Motorsports.  Could this be the
chassis dyno you are referring to?  If so, Read on!  They claimed to be
experts, and our mutual friend had let them do minor work to his Porsche . . .
and thought they knew what they were doing.  Prieviously, Eric Steinell had
done my work, but I was ready to try someone new and Dayton wasn't that far a
drive.  Our friend spoke highly of them and they had a great looking web page.

     When I went to see them, I took my RS, and two other chips.   The chip in
the car was an Authority Chip, which I felt was the fastest . . . and in a
box, I had a Porsche Carrera Cup chip, (Pursched directly from Porsche AG
while I was in Germany the month before, and a stock chip.  They put my car on
the Chassis dyno, and then ran it with all three chips.    Results?   the
Authority chip showed less than stock HP....the Porsche chip was a 3HP gain,
and then the guy, Rich I believe his name was, offered to let me try a in-
house chip which he said was a real barn burner.   I should have known better,
but I fell for it hook, line and sinker. And guess what?   The in house chip
showed a wopping 15HP increase on their chassis dyno.  Holy megabytes,
Batman!!!    OK, now I'll cut to the chase.  I bought the chip, got a valve
adjustment and oilchange and on the way home didn't feel that the car was as
strong as it was when I  had left that morning.   Two months later, I dropped
a valve, (bad valve adjustment?) and the motor needed to be rebuilt.    Now,
here comes the interesting part.   I sent the motor to Andial.  When they had
finished it, I flew to Calif, DME box and extra chips in hand.   Guess what?
We ran the motor on Andials dyno, and tested all three chips.  (I have the
dyno sheets to prove it also)  Guess who the top bananna was??   the Authority
chip.  Which made an honest 13 HP over the stock chip.   Second was the chip
from Porsche, (9 HP)   and last the Howe big dog chip,  honest, I think that's
what he called it......and that was a copy of an earlier Autothority chip . .
..MORAL of the story?   If you believe what you see on a chassis dyno, run by
someone who wants to sell you parts, you are being very foolish.  Only an
engine dyno, with controled conditions, duplicated the same every time, is
accurate....a chassis dyno is only a tuning measure, and not an indication of
true horsepower or torque, and the operator can make it read anything he
wants.....or does not want to.  And, by the way, I called Howe to complain . .
.. and was going to get my attorney involved, but it seems that they are now
out of business . . . I don't have the slightest idea why, do you??   So Alan,
not everything is as it seems . . . and experts are everywhere . . .you catch
my drift?
