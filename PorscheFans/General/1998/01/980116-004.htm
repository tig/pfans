Does anyone know if this is true?  There are conflicting reports on this
list and others about the FCC action.
We all need to know if lobbying here is necessary.

"http://www.fcc.gov/"  Federal Comm.Commission (FCC)
There is a very important matter currently under review by the FCC. Your
local telephone company has filed a proposal with the FCC to impose per
minute charges for your internet service. They contend that your usage
has or will hinder the operation of the telephone network.  It is my
belief that internet usage will diminish if users were required to pay
additional per minute charges.  The FCC has created an email box for
your comments, responses must be received by February 13, 1998.  Send
your comments to isp@fcc.gov and tell them what you think.  Every phone
company is in on this one, and they are trying to sneak it in just under
the wire for litigation.  Let everyone you know hear this one. Get the
e-mail address to everyone you can think of.
FCC e-mail----->   isp@fcc.gov
