My son and I went to the Detroit Auto Show yesterday and
as usual Porsche had a terrific display, right in the middle
of the action surrounded by Ferrari, BMW, and Mecedes Benz.
It seemed to me that the 3 German marques were getting the
most attention, but then you could actually touch them (but 
not the Ferraris). There were a number of the "New 911s" and 
about 4 or 5 Boxters but what I found most interesting was
the nice way Porsche displayed cut-aways of their machinery
for all to see. One was a complete watercooled 911 chassis/
engine/Tiptronic. Leaving aside the somewhat controversial
body design (in some eyes), the structure looked rock solid,
clever, and the drivetrain looked very compact. It was nice
to be able to see the 'works' like this since it's so 
hidden away in the whole car. There was also a cutaway
manual transmission. 

If you can make it, the show is terrific all around, and
of course the Porsche display will likely be the highlight
for you as it was for me.

<HTML><PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>Porsche's 50th Anniversary to Be
Celebrated Throughout North America

<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>RENO, Nev., Jan. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- A long
awaited anniversary of one of the world's most revered automakers will take
place during 1998.  Fifty years ago, on June 8, 1948, the first production car
to bear the Porsche name was completed in the tiny village of Gmund, Austria.

Created by Prof. Ferry Porsche and designated the 356, this initial sports car
launched the Porsche marque in the automobile industry.  As the first Porsche,
it also laid the technical foundation for many succeeding and highly prized
Porsche models.

Porsche's momentous 50th anniversary will be celebrated throughout the year at
numerous worldwide activities including many of North America's premier
automotive events.  In America, Porsche will be the featured marque at the
Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance (April 18) in Florida, the Meadow Brook Hall
Concours d'Elegance and Historic Races (Aug. 1-2) in Michigan and the Monterey
Historic Automobile Races (Aug. 14-16) in Northern California.  The Pebble
Beach Concours d'Elegance (Aug. 16), the National Automobile Museum (April
20-Aug. 9) in Reno and the Petersen Automotive Museum (Sept. 11-Nov. 6) in Los
Angeles will highlight special displays commemorating Porsche's golden
anniversary.  And Watkins Glen International will hold a unique Double Fifty
Porsche Celebration (Aug. 28-30) honoring both Porsche's anniversary and the
50th anniversary of the rebirth of American road racing at the New York race
course.

The Porsche AG Museum in Germany will provide a selection of outstanding
historic automobiles for these North American activities, several of which are
making their first appearance on the continent.  In addition, track events
will be attended by such famous Porsche race drivers as Hurley Haywood, Vic
Elford, George Follmer and Brian Redman.
