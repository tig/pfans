	I have to agree with this...
Porsche is known to build amazing sport cars and shift in their focus
can be a big mistake. Let´s take a look at the Mercedes case: they are
known to build great luxury cars, big and expensive ones... But now they
are trying to build a small and cheaper car: The "A" Class. What happens
then? In their first show to the media, the car turned over!! What
happend?? They shifted their focus and forgot that their "Essencial
Competence" is to build Big and Heavy cars! This can happen to Porsche.
I know that Mercedes has the "M" Class, but i just want to point an
example of what could happen to our loved Porsche. Maybe, if Porsche
REALLY wants to get in this market, they could use the same idea that
created the LEXUS, a new company that builds SUVs and other kinds of
cars with the great name of Porsche behind it. The Porsche name wouldn't
be jeopardized and the new company could use the benefits of having this
great name to approve their products.

Dear David,

    Saw your message to Alan, and you mentioned Rich Howe of the now defunct
Howe Motorsports.  Well, boy have I got one for you.  I also made the mistake
of taking my car there, a 944 Turbo which I have increased to 2.8 Ltrs.   All
I wanted was his dyno tuning and some suggestions.  6 thousand dollars and
much heartache later, I got my 944 back, with oil leaks, wrong parts and ill
fitting panels put back into the interior.  To make matters worse, the motor
was weaker than when I originaly brought it to them, with an additional 2
thousand miles on the speedo.  (we had to test it out throughly, his partner
said.)

     I also was going to sue, however they are now out of business.  Disturbed
as I am, if I knew where I could locate him, I think I would buy a gun.  It's
guys like Howe that make the Porsche repair business a very sharp learning
curve and makes us distrust anyone else who we go to.

     Guess I have joined the club.  
P.S.
     If you know anyone who knows how to reach him, please let me know.  I
have this really big, mean friend.

I wonder if Motor Works in San Diego did the engine work on that 928
