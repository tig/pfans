    Porsche has been building weirdo things for years. The English
magazine,911 & Porsche World number 36 has an article on Porsche tractors,
complete with photos and a "test run" with a1957 model. Ferdinand Porsche
began building tractors in 1914 and except for a couple of breaks, built
right through to 1964 when the operation was sold to Renault. There were 58
varieties and a total of more than 150,000 units sold.
    Excellence magazine June 1997 has an interesting article on the Paris to
Dakar rally. The Porsche team chase car for the 1986 event was a Mercedes
offroader fitted with a four valve 928 engine. Porsche welded 959 brakes on
to it (more spares). The engine was fitted to make it faster and test the
four valve heads. In the 1985 Pharaoh rallye the chase/offroader driven by
Kussmaul, came second when one of the 959's driven by Ickx caught fire. A
local,Saaeed al Hajris won in the other 959
