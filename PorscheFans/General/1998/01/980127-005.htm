I read the autobiography of Ferri Porsche about a year ago.  It's a good
Porsche history book, covers Porsche car business in great detail up to about 1970.
The Porsche family's involvement with the Nazi's that I recall from book was
the designing of military equipment such as Schwimmer, Kubelwagen, and
tanks.  The Porsche firm was strictly a design studio until after the war.
Manufacturing of Porsche cars started in Gmund while it was occupied
by US troops. 
Dr. Ferdinand Porsche was asked to come to France after the war 
to assist in designing a vehicle for France's government.
Dr. Porsche and Ferri Porsche were arrested when they arrived in France.
They were accused of something to do with selling parts to the Nazi's.
Neither were ever charged with any specific crimes.  Ferri was detained for
about 6-9 months.  Dr. Porsche was held for about a year and a half total.
Dr. Porsche health deteriorate during his detainment and died within about
two years after his release.
The autobiography of Ferri Porsche, I found it at the local public library.
Thanks for the bandwidth.

There is no Porsche script. It is a logo. I spent many hours, which included
calls to PCNA and other places trying to locate  the "font" that Porsche used
for their logo. The answer came from many sources that there was no Porsche
font, it was a logo created by a graphic artist.

Dear Weasel

Look for a bood called "Porsche-----When exelence was expected"  Very good
hystory book.  Dr. Porsche did spend some time in a French prison though was
not guilty of what he was charged. And in some books, backs up the not guilty
thery.   In brief, he was charged for spying, steeling, and giving Germany a
unfair advantage in the war. Though the books go into more detail on what and
how he was charged.  Also check out "Porsche--the art of the Sports Car"  Its
a new release and has some new and much more current info on some of the P-
cars.
