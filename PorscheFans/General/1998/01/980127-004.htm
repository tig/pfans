He was not convicted on any crimes. He was not present at the Nurenberg
trials. He was held in a French prison until the family could get enough
"ransom" together to pay for his release. He was never formerly charged
with anything by the Allies or the French.

Considering he was Austrian, not German, it is probably safe to say that
he was not likely to be a "Nazi" in the traditional sense of the word. My
Grandmother was a member of the Nazi party but was against a lot of things
that happened after 1934 that were beyond the control of anyone but a
select few.

This is ridiculous! He did not have a prison sentence. He had wanted to
produce his own "sports car" prior to WWII. He built plenty of two seaters
for other companies prior to WWII. I am pretty sure he never cared about
the golf bag directly. That was something his son, Ferry, and the design
team may of had an interest in....

Maybe it's time to read it again....
