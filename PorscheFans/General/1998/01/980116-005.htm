This is not meant as a flame and maybe this should be in the tavern list. 
I disagree strongly though with the comment above.  Porsche has been very
successful in selling its expertise for years.  For me, a few good
examples of Porsche getting involved in other products are the Mercedes
E500, the Spanish Seat Ibiza, the Polish Skoda cars and the Zil (or Ziv ,
sp?) Russian limousines.  In the United States, Porsche seems to be mostly
known for its sports cars.  In Europe it is known also as a source of good
consultants who know their stuff.  Most member of the VW group (which
includes Skoda and Seat amd Audi) have at some point used Porsche to
improve their products.  Zil asked Porsche to bail them out when they
realized their cars were such piece of junk they needed serious help and I
think one could hardly call the E500 a failure.  Porsche did also win the
contract for a mass produced car by the Chinese government, but I have not
heard much about it since then.  It may even be that their consulting
services helped Porsche stay afloat when the US sales nose dived and
Porsche was ready to close their doors when they could not sell their cars
in the late 80's and early 90's. 

I am not necessarily saying that Porsche should build an SUV.  It may
indeed be too late.  OTOH, Mercedes did come in late to the game and still
they cannot keep the ML320 on the showroom floors as they get sold so
fast.  Could Porsche build something priced reasonably?  I doubt it, the
Boxster and the 996 share a lot of parts which is what Porsche wanted all
along after the restructuring.  I do not see how their SUV could share
panels or many other parts with the other cars, thus I do not see it
materializing inexpensively.  Furthermore, a Porsche SUV would be pretty
much a car aimed only at the US market.  One would hope that Porsche
learned it lesson already and will not put all of its automotive eggs in
the US market again. 

Just my $0.02, no flames intended(but I am putting my Nomex suit on
anyway).
