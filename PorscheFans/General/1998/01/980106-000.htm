TO ALL SHARK FANS

I am trying to obtain details of a British limited edition (only 30
imported) for an article.
The model in is question is the 1988 928 S4 sport (a manual only model).
It is supposed to be 200pounds lighter than a standard S4, special seats
etc.
A friend owns one but knows zip.
It appears to be a forerunner of the GT. It has the same wheels etc.
I require as much information ASAP.

Thanks

Regards

Dear David,

      Read your recent posts about Windward, and wanted to share my
experiences with you.  Everytime I call Performance Products, A.J. Racing or
Automotion, I get put on hold, (Ignore, I believe should be the proper word),
and then have to wait . . .eventually have to either wait for the salesman to
call me back, or call again.

If a person expects the McDonalds treatment in the Porsche aftermarket,
(meaning super quick service with a fake smile and discount prices, then we
all are in a world of trouble.  It bothers me that it seems some people harp
about 'much to do about nothing'.  OK, Windward didnt return someones call . .
.. since when did we all become perfect?   In my business,  it occasionally
happens that I dont return every call when I am very busy . . . there are only
so many hours in the day.  And a few of the items I have read about, seemed to
happen at least a month ago, and people are just now complaining.    Looks
like a few of us have too much free time on our hands.  

     I can, and will share my experience with you.  I called, and these guys
pounced on my 951's needs, providing me with a very effective ,Bilstien based
,suspension
system and a bounty of original ideas.  Over the past three years recieved
only prompt, courteious and extremly knowledgable input from them and will
continue to call them first for my Porsche needs.   

     Not enough people say good things about someone when they do an
outstanding job . . .  and we are all too quick to fault someone when they
mistakenly drop the ball.    Just wanted you to know someone else was in your
court.

<HTML><PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>Porsche's North American Sales
Increase 87 Percent in 1997

<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>            Best Year for North American
Porsche Sales Since 1988

    RENO, Nev., Jan. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (PCNA)
and Porsche Cars Canada, Ltd. (PCC) today announced they have achieved their
best sales year since 1988, selling a combined 13,731 sports cars during 1997.
Due in large part to the 1997 introduction of the Porsche Boxster, the
company's entry-level model and first all-new sports car in 19 years, sales
figures reflected an 87 percent increase over calendar year 1996.  It marked
the fourth year in a row Porsche has realized significant sales increases in
the U.S. and Canadian markets.

    PCNA reported total 1997 sales of 12,972 cars, an 86 percent increase over
its 1996 figures.  PCC recorded 1997 total sales of 759 automobiles, a 110
percent gain over the previous year.

    Porsche expects to experience similar North American sales growth in 1998
with the introduction of the newest version of its famed Porsche 911 model
currently taking bows at the Detroit and Los Angeles auto shows.
