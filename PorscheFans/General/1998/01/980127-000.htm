Dr. Porsche and several of his family were indeed convicted of 'war =
crimes' at the Nurenberg trials, due to his involvement with the =
development of the Volkswagen in the late 1930's, which was one of =
Hitler's ideas (in so far as providing the masses with an inexpensive =
form of transportation).

Dr. Porsches involvement with the vehicle continued with the onset of =
WWII, and expanded into designing several military vehicles. This was =
viewed by the allies as him being a Nazi sympathizer. Just what his =
political views were, I have not seen documented. Whether he was a =
sympathizer, or just a lover of his country, right or wrong, I can't =
say.

It was after his prison sentence was completed that the good Dr. =
answered the question he apparently had time to ponder "What could a car =
be, if it only had to carry two passengers?", and the Porsche automobile =
was born. He later expanded this question to include "two passengers and =
a golf bag". (to this day, one of Porsche AG's design criteria)

This info is documented in almost every book about Porsche vehicles, and =
there are a number of them available. Probably the best to read =
regarding this issue is "The History of Porsche".

I reckon it to have been the same situation in this country, those who =
condemn him, need to ask themselves, "What did you do in the 60's?"

85 944 NA 'Cause it's the best damn car I ever drove (certainly not the =
fastest)
