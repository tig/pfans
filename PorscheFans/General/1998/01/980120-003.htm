Mike, it's probably an '87-'89 you're looking for.  Those years were the
last of the 3.2 Carreras and had the upgraded clutch and gearbox.  Some
(like me) consider them the last of the "classic" 911's.  '90 was the first
model year of the C2 model.  There was also a C4 in '89, but it doesn't
sound like that's what you have in mind.

There are some info-packed links at
http://www.haphazard.com/pcd/pcd_links.htm that will sort this out for you.
 You'll also find Bruce Anderson's "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook" and
Pete Zimmerman's "The Used 911 Story" useful.   Both are in their 2nd
edition and available through www.amazon.com and elsewhere.

Good luck,
