=46or an explanation of the above you should read what's on the Magnecor =
web
site at www.magnecor.com.  Admittedly, Magnecor does have an interest in
destroying the claims made by Nology, but after you read what they say I
think you might be a bit more skeptical of Nology.  I was, and I now have
Magnecor wires.  Too bad you didn't read the above web site info *before*
the show or you could have asked Ulf to perform the test recommended by
Magnecor...  might have been interesting.

Incidently, as pointed out by Magnecor, *no* wire can increase HP.  The
very best it can do is attempt to transfer the greatest amount of the
available spark energy.  Virtually any NEW set of wires will do that.  =
But
normal carbon wires break down quite quickly, and that's why you want
something better that will last and won't generate EMI and RFI problems
with your computer controlled vehicle.
