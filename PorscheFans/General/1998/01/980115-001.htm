Who ever said the Porsche SUV had to have four doors?

Personally, I think that a Porsche+partner SUV entry would be an unwise
strategic decision at this time.  The off-road market is glutted with every
conceivable (and preposterous) variation of the SUV concept.  From the Kia
Sportage to the Ford "Behemoth" Expedition, I don't see a lucrative niche
for Porsche.

I've read that demand for SUV's is already waning.  The U.S. automakers'
response? "We'll build bigger SUV's" (no joke).

If Porsche built an AWD 996 with 20" clearance, huge, high-profile, knobby
tires and brushguards I would go drool on it at the dealer, but I would
never buy one.

There are only so many oil sheiks with the means and a dire need to careen
across rough terrain at 120mph, and they probably already have one of those
Lamborghini tanks.

Besides, there is no demand for serious performance AWD cars as demonstrated
by the meager sales of the Ford Cosworth RS Turbo (still raced in the WRC
but no longer produced for street use), Subaru Impreza WTX, Mitsubishi
Lancer Evolution and Lancia Integrale.  None were/are even ever offered for
sale in the U.S.  Now those cars are the true SUV's.
