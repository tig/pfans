	I just wanted to clear up any confusion I may have caused by
asking about Dr. Porsche's involvement with Nazi Germany.  I wasn't trying
to stir trouble, condemn or applaud anything he did.  Nor was I trying to
make any comments about Porsche as a company.  I keep both things quite
separate in my mind and I would never persecute the child for the sins of
the father.  Besides, I'd be quite the hyprocit because I really like my
911.  However, I live near a rather orthodox jewish neighborhood that
tends to look down upon my German cars (curiously, they have no problem
with Japanese cars).  So I was just hoping to arm myself with the truth so
when the inevitable discussion occurs, I would have something intelligent
to say.
