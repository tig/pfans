with=0Amany major design changes. Since the engine could not be certifica=

To clarify, the off-road 4wd stuff WAS only to test and refine the systems for
the road cars. Porsche doesn't rally for fun. If they could beat the hell out
of the tranny in the Paris-Dakar rally and place 1,2 and 6 (?), it was
dependable enough for the road cars, hence the 964 C4 and AWD Turbo.  The
system was also tested on race courses in the 961 prior to going into the road
cars.  And what has Elford in a 66 911 (2 wheel drive) got to do with 4wd
testing and refining? That was just another endurance test to show the world
the dependability of an existing design, not to refine a 4wd system that
didn't exist at the time.
   It's the same situation with the sportomatic. Before they put it into
production, they beat the hell out of it in the '67 Marathon de la Route .
Elford won with the sportomatic in an orange 911S, if I remember correctly.
Once it proved itself, they offered it for the '68 model year. They produced a
really bitchin' poster of it, too!
  And another thing......   The bikes (F and FS) don't seem to bother me. They
fit in with the Porsche image. Neither does the 3.2 Mooney aircraft because
that's a step up. So is the airship (zepplin ! ) with the Carrera engines.
However, I was shocked to read on a "Carrera Mail" poster that Porsche is
designing an engine for Harley-Davidson. If it leaks less oil than a tired ol'
2.7, it would still be an improvement over a Harley motor !    Anyway, dat's
da name o' dat tune. Baretta.    See you all over the road,  Tim
Love them Porsches.
