I read somewhere that virtually every dirigible in the U.S. is powered by a
Porsche flat-six.  Any truth to that?

Can anyone comment on just what kind of development Porsche has done for
that famous we-won't-say-the-name-but-we-all-know-who-it-is motorcycle maker?

I would like to remind everybody that Porsche is indeed a company that does
not necessarily restrict itself to sportscars.  While the company needs to
protect the integrity and strength of the brand and image, which are the
direct result of its sportscar production, the company also offers varied
design, research and consulting services.  I would like to refer to an
interview with Wendelin Wiedekind in the latest Panorama in which Porsche's
CEO declares that the company now offers corporate restructuring training
and consulting services (!).
