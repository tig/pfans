First, you should have written (mass x g) which will give you a force 
- weight already is a force. Second, that simplification completely 
neglects the structural characteristics of the tire carcass. The 
sidewalls and belts, especially in a performance tire, are load 
bearing structures and consequently the average surface pressure of 
the contact patch will NOT equal the inflation pressure of the tire. 
What this means is that I can have two tires, running the same air 
pressure, with radically different size contact patches.

You are right about altering the shape of the contact patch but
widening can also increase the area due to the fact that the tire is
a complex load bearing structure, not a uniform deformable cylinder.

That is only true for non-deformable materials with uniform surfaces. 
Tire compounds are highly deformable and concrete and asphalt are far 
from uniform.

Becuase of deformability and non-uniformity, there is a huge 
difference between felt on a desk and a tire on asphalt. The eraser 
experiment is not really relevant because the desk is far more 
uniform than a road surface and there is not enough downward force on 
the eraser to cause deformation to become a factor. Here's a better 
experiment: cut a 4"x8" piece of felt and glue it to a 4"x8" 
piece of stiff cardboard. Attach a string to the cardboard so you can 
pull it across a surface. Set the cardboard felt side down on a large 
piece of 40 grit sandpaper stapled to a piece of plywood. Set a brick 
on the cardboard and tie the string to a spring scale. Measure how 
much force it takes to make the cardboard start sliding. Now repeat 
the experiment using a 4"x4" piece of felt and cardboard.

Rubber on asphalt is like felt on sandpaper. The rubber "grips" the 
irregularities of the surface by deforming to match their shape. Any 
lateral load is going to be distributed evenly to all the spots where 
the rubber is "gripping". If you increase the number of gripping 
spots (by increasing surface area), the amount of force applied to 
each spot is reduced proportionally. If it takes X force to overcome 
the grip at all the irregularities and then you double the number of 
irregularities by increasing the surface area, it will now take 2X 
force to make the object slide. You eventually reach a point of 
diminishing returns (where surface pressure is not great enough to 
cause the rubber to deform) but up to that point, increasing the size 
of the contact patch will give you a corresponding increase in grip.

Now, keep in mind that this discussion has focused only on static 
behavior. The dynamics get much more complicated as you get into 
lateral deformation and slip angles. Despite the complications, the 
results remain the same: up to a point, wider is better.
