Using the Porsche powered Mooney airplane is a good example of Porsche
developing new products and branching out from their core business.  It
was a disaster.

The PFM Mooney (I believe this was its designation) was a technological
marvel in 1987? and significantly ahead of any other piston powered
plane on the market, however, it was a poor design and did not meet a
market demand.  The plane was easy to fly because it eliminated two of
the engine controls typically found on high performance piston aircraft
(mixture and prop controls), but the engine was way too heavy and
under-powered.  It was also expensive.  I believe the plane was only
produced one year and then yanked from  production.  

Also, Porsche did not build the plane (Mooney did, and Mooney is known
for their high-performance, efficient airplanes), but merely designed
and built the engine.  Had Porsche built the plane, I think we would all
be on a mailing list discussing a defunct company.  Almost no airplane
manufacturer escaped the 80's unscathed, and Porsche certainly did not
have the capital to invest in that sort of undertaking.

Just my $0.02.

Ps - the SUV thing is a stupid idea.  Too late, wrong image, too much
capital, too much competition...

-- There's an airship using Porsche engines too...

-- Hmm - didn't know there was a Porsche Mooney though. I've always
wanted
-- a Mooney! Hoping for that first big lottery win any day now... come
on baby!!!
