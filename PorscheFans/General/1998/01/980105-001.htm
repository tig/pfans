Hi, I was wondering if by any chance  anyone  might have info about smog 
testing from your past experiences before this year.

I have a 1974 911S.  It has standard CIS injection, but unfortunately, even 
though its 25 years old as of Jan 1 1998, it is not included in SB-42.   The 
legislation states cars 25 years and older, but for some reason it is for cars 
26 years and older.  I guess this is because when the bill was initially 
written up, 73's where 25, but unfortunately for any '74 owners, when the bill 
was passed a year later, there was no change allowing the '74's not to be 
smogged.  So now there are all these 1974's out there that were not originally 
required to be designed for emissions standards even Federally, not to mention 
the strict CA standards!!!!    The major dillema is that this is the last year 
of car manufactured with no cat, smog pump, or regulations to do so.   There 
was no "California" version of the 911 until 1975.  The laws at that time only 
came into effect as of Jan1 1975, so anything built previous to that does not 
have the necc. gear.


What do I need to do to my car to get it to pass?????

Are there higher emittance levels permitted for 74's???

It seems ugly to have to change headers, muffler, add cat or smog pump only to 
spend $1500, plus $300 for smog, and then end up losing power and reliability 
because the car was not designed to run with so much back pressure.

Please reply to doab@msn.com if you know anything that might help me figure 
out my dilema.  I am just moving to CA, so the car is coming from NYC 
currently.

thanks, Mike Serpe
