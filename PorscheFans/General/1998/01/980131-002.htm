The Indy 500 has been sold out every year since 1973.  There are well over
500,000 people in attendance including last year.  There are several places
to obtain tickets, however depending upon how much you are willing to spend
and if and where you wish to sit.  General admission tickets are available
at the gate for the infield the morning of the race.  Arrive early for this
option as I believe the gates open at 6:00 am.  The local PCA region
generally has some tickets available at cost for local and national PCA
members.  If not the local PCA will have advertisements in their monthly
newsletter for people re-selling tickets at a premium.  You may wish to
contact Harold Crane who is the local PCA Region President at 317-875-0922
or the VP, Chuck Langsenkamp at 317-251-3694. You should not that scalping
is legal in Indiana and you will pay a premium, whether in advance or
outside the gates, for premium tickets.  There is also a ticket reseller in
Indianapolis by the name of Tickets-Up-Front which deals in all local
tickets and will find you tickets and resell them to you again at a premium
(generally figure double).  Great experience if you haven't yet been there.
 Good Luck.
