When you did that experiment, there was only friction of two hard surfaces, a
tire also has mechanical grip on the pavement, the relatively soft rubber and
the rough pavement actually interlock giving better traction. If this were not
the case, drag racers wouldn't be able to accelerate as hard as they do.
