William,

Please see this URL:

   http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/ispfact.html

It has a Q&A that debunks this email. Specifically, there is text that
says this:

   Please Note: There is no open comment period in this proceeding.
   If you have recently seen a message on the Internet stating that
   in response to a request from local telephone companies, the FCC
   is requesting comments to <isp@fcc.gov> by February 1998, be aware
   that this information is inaccurate.

<HTML><PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>Porsche Cars North America and
Goodby Silverstein & Partners Agree to End Relationship

<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>RENO, Nev., Jan. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche
Cars North America, Inc. (PCNA), the exclusive importer of Porsche automobiles
and parts in the U.S. and Canada, and its advertising agency, Goodby,
Silverstein & Partners (GS&P), today announced they have mutually decided to
part company.

According to Richard Ford, PCNA executive vice president of marketing and
sales, the decision to end the relationship was due to differences over
account operations, not creativity.

"The advertising we have created with the GS&P people has served us very
well," Ford said. "Yes, sales are terrific and we are stronger than ever, but
we had some major differences on how to move forward from here and mutually
agreed that separation was the best solution."

"We have been very pleased with the work we've been able to create for
Porsche," related GS&P Co-chairman Jeffery Goodby.  "We remain friendly with
everyone there, but this seemed like a good time for both of us to move on."
According to Ford and Goodby, GS&P will complete existing projects.

"We envision the split and transition will go smoothly," added Ford. Joel
Ewanick, PCNA's marketing general manager, stated that the search for another
agency cannot move forward until PCNA concludes the move of its headquarters
from Nevada to Georgia.

"We won't be looking for a new agency until late in the spring after we have
completed our relocation to Atlanta," Ewanick explained.

In 1993, PCNA awarded the sports car account to San Francisco-based GS&P. The
agency worked on the introduction of the redesigned 1995 Porsche 911 and last
year's new Porsche Boxster.

The award-winning campaigns were aimed at positioning Porsche to a wider
audience for the entry level Boxster, which was designed to reach a broader
market, and the recently unveiled 1999 Porsche 911, the model's first complete
redesign in its 34-year history.

"We wanted the advertising to portray our sports cars as something more than
status symbols," said Ford.  "We wanted Porsches to be seen as less
exclusionary and far more than fast cars for wealthy people."

"We wanted to humanize them, to describe them as wonderful, handmade objects
that were the best of their kind in the world -- not just status symbols,"
added Goodby, "and together with PCNA, I think we achieved this goal."

"And we had fun doing it," Ford said in agreement.
