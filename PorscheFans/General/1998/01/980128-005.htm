MILLE MIGLIA
The Mille Miglia runs from May 14th to 17th 1998.  The Start/Finish is
in Brescia, Italy.
It is one of worlds most historic road races, running through
breathtaking Northern Italy and is unique in fact that you can drive
(please note we are not racing our selves) on the same roads (within the
race field) as the competitors (Gull wing Mercedes, Classic Porsches,
Classic Ferraris & Astons etc), while the event takes place.

It is the intention of a group of Porsche Fans (with cars of all ages)
from various European countries & clubs to travel to this event. Should
anyone else be interested in taking part with our group please contact
MICHAEL BREMER on Langheck@cww.de
