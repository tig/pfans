Hi P-fans,
I was at work today and one of my co-workers who has the luxury of =
coming in at 12pm told me that Speedvision featured a ducumentary on =
Porsche from the first car produced to present day.  Yeah...that's right =
I'm sitting at work at a computer terminal while a show on mine and your =
favorite car was on.....aaaargh!    I missed it. =20
My point to all this is that, I was wondering if anyone got a copy of =
this on video tape that would be willing to dub a copy for me.  I'm =
willing to pay a fee (obiously to outrageous).  I'll pay for the =
shipping involved. =20
So if you were lucky enough to get a copy and can help me on my quest =
please e-mail me.
Thanks again
Happy Porsche-ing

Hey there P-Fans

	For those list members who use Mobil-1 oil, Porsche does make a decal. The
decal comes on euro 993 models. It is a 2"x3" decal stating the following:

"Mobil-1"
"Porsche emphfiehlt"
"exklusiv Mobil-1"
"Erstbefullung"
"Mobil-1 Motorenol"
      -----
"Porsche exclusively"
"reccomends Mobil-1"
"Filled from new with"
"Mobil-1 engine oil"


	The decals Porsche part #993-006-544-00 and cost $2.

Hello P-Fans

Well - It looks like the SCCA will try to srew this race up too! But I am
keeping my fingers crossed.
