<<I would like to understand, exactly, why increasing the width of a
tire can
help to increase road friction (all else being equal).  The answer I've
gotten is "There is more surface area in contact with the pavement, so
there's more friction.  Duh."

To me this doesn't add up, for not one but two reasons:

Reason one: vaguely recalling my physics class, there's such a thing as
a
"coefficient of friction".  Given a block resting on a surface, the
lateral
resistance to force is proportional to the downward force applied to the
block by, for example, gravity.  As I recall, the area of contact was
not a
factor when calculating lateral friction, which indicates to me that the
size of the contact patch should not be a factor.

Reason two: A wider tire shouldn't increase the contact area anyway. 
Given
that the total area of the contact patch is a function of the downward
force
on the tire and the air pressure within it, making the tire wider will
serve
only to change the shape of the contact patch, not its area.

So much for theory.  Can some kind soul share the real physics behind
this?>>

Hi Forrest,

For 'real answers' I suggest you read "How to Make Your Car Handle" by
Fred Puhn, "Tune to Win" by Carroll Smith, and "Race Car Vehicle
Dynamics" by Milliken, et al. They increase in complexity in that order.

The short answers are these:

Reason one: A tire is not a block of wood. Doh! Because it is made of a
material that will distort, the grip is equal to the contact patch. (The
cF stays exactly the same as you mentioned.) For a practical
demonstration, take an eraser and stand it on it's end and move it
across the table top. Now put it on it's face and try the same thing. If
you don't have an eraser, try it with a tire. <g>

Reason two: You are dead on with your reasoning, but the shape is all
important! With a wider tire you have a wider contact patch transversely
and narrower longitudinally. Hence, it can grip better when subjected to
lateral Gs. Most vehicles cannot overpower the longitudinal grip of the
tires so that is typically not an issue unless you are a top fuel drag
racer. (You can experiment with your eraser / tire on this one, too! ;-)
) When you take dynamic weight transfer into account, the tires with the
most weight can have a _huge_ contact patch in relation to the
unweighted tires. "Bob Bondurant On High Performance Driving" has a good
chapter about "contact patch management" replete with pictures.
Unfortunately, most of the rest of the book is nothing but an ad for his
driving school including pictures of him with celebrities...

I hope this helps,

Paul Foster
