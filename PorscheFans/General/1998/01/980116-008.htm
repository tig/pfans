There was also the Porsche 597/LKW 0.25t military offroader from 1957-195=
8.
These are the forefathers of today's SUV's!  It never did go into regular
production, does anyone know?  Did they miss out on a large military tend=
er?
Not exactly pretty, kind of like a VW Kubelwagen with four wheel drive an=
d
looking a little more serious.  Wheelbase 2600mm, Length 3600mm, Width
1560mm, Height 1580 (no roof??)

Had this been produced in numbers =E0 la Land Rover/Land Cruiser/Jeep etc
militant originals, we might have a whole different view (and availabilit=
y)
of Porsche SUV's today...

No great loss.
