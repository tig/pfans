You know the one that comes with every Porsche. Mine stopped working after
using it for about 15 minutes. Let it cool down and tried it again the
next day, but still would'nt work. I had it hooked up directly to a spare 
battery so it's not the car's electricals problem. I don't see an in-line
fuse anywhere. Anyone fixed/dismantled one of these? Lemmy no, TIA

Many people have made many comments about the new SUVs as I have.  And some of
you might look at Porsche only as a great sports car maker and a image to up
hold as a great sports car maker.  But I also look at Porsche as a inventor,
and a place of ideas that can be put into a phyisical action.  But as Tim had
stated before,  "And the off-road 4-wheel drive stuff was only to test and
refine their 4wd road cars." is incorrect.  In 1966, Vic Elford helped start
Porsches rally programs by racing the Tour de Corse.  By 1986, Porsche had a
full blown all wheel drive 911 known as the Typ 959 Paris-Dakar Rally,
complete with what appears to be over a 18" of clearance.  No low profile
tires for this car and for those not familiar with the Paris-Dakar.  It is
14,000km or (8750 miles) of dirt, rock and sand in the middle of a desert.  I
wouldn’t worry about what Porsche is about to produce, for I’m sure they know
what they are doing.  But most likely, what ever they will produce will be the
best of their combined efforts.  As Porsche has stated, "when excellence was
expected".  If any one wants to see some neat pictures of the 959s, look for a
book by the name of "Porsche Legends"

Charles Broadfoot.

P.S.  What about the Porsche Mooney air plane?  That is not the first porsche
made air craft ether.
