sorry I'm replying to this message so late but I feel I have to add my 0=
..02
cents on this one... even tho this thread seems dead and buried...

A) Porsche has plenty of know-how many things they've forgotten other ca=
r
makers can only dream of EVER knowing... 
Look at the 959... car is 12 years old now... only now are cars starting=
 to
come out w/ automatic height adjustment... and only the most technologic=
ally
gifted car makers would even try it... Range Rover is doing super stuff =
w/ it.

what I will say as far as the partnerships thing is concerned... taking =
someone
on to guide them thru the woods if you will... Porsche could go out and =
buy one
of each of the best SUV's out there ... a Jeep Grand Cherokee(5.9 or not=
), a
Range Rover 4.6 (or 4.0), a Discovery, a Hummer... strip em to the bolts=
.... and
understand every mechanism... this isnt Toyota... this is the company th=
at
helps develop everything and anything on the road that we look at and dr=
ewl
over... Technologically speaking they are GODs... this is why we buy the=
ir
cars... it shows in their products... everytime you turn the ignition yo=
u know
your sitting in a car way beyond what else is out there.

B) Rumors of where Porsche's SUV would come from have been circulating f=
or
years... first it was the Mercedes partnership.. that the M-Class would =
be the
as is but the Porsche model would have a bigger grunt and better interio=
r...
then word had it that the partnership had failed... this one I thought m=
ade
sense... given Porsche's involvement in the E500 a second partnership di=
dn't
seem so far-fetched... and MB pulling the deal that would have left them=
 as
second fiddle doesn't sound to hard to swallow either...  in either case=
 that
DIDN'T happen...

the current rumor I'd read about was that Porsche was working w/ VW/Audi=
....
that the Audi model would be based on a VW engine and that the Porsche m=
odel
based on an Audi engine... this one sounds fishy to me... the engines pa=
rt at
least...
a partnership of VW Group and Porsche is not far fetched in any capacity=
... I
mean Ferdinand Porsche the GOD of our clan... created the Bug for god's =
sake
for VW before starting Porsche Cars... and everyone knows the VW Group v=
ia its
Audi distribution network had been importing Porsches for years before P=
CNA
really got the job... 

but alas at best these are rumors.. until someone inside can substantiat=
e them
that is...

C) If Porsche would go about getting someone to help them... I would ima=
gine
they would have a short list of candidates... Jeep, Range Rover, Hummer.=
... no
one else fits the bill

sorry to the Ford and Chevy fans... and all the Japanese trucks are crap=
 too

If Porsche made an SUV I would find it hard to believe they would go aft=
er the
Tahoe/Suburban/Expedition market... ugly and clunky...and no style what =
so
ever... plus no major technological advantages
and the Land Cruiser... its just as bad... and dont get me started on th=
e
Lincoln Navigator.

Porsche would be making something that would be light and nimble... and =
capable
to carry the crest or they simply wouldnt make on...

I could see Porsche making a truck w/ Range Rover's help... don't see th=
at
alliance happening cuz BMW wouldnt want the competition on its shores...=
 they
will have their hands full w/ their own SUV... and trying to compete w/ =
the
M-Class w/ it... But as far as Porsche is concerned I could see them goi=
ng to
Range Rover for advice... or Jeep (the grand daddy of em all)

Hummer would make good research but I dont see Porsche working in that s=
ize...
capabilities of the Hummer yes... size/gas guzzling ...no
