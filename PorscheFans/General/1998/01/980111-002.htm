eloquently stated:

>i see this name of a lot of race cars and was wondering who it was?

Drink up!  It's a beer.  In fact, it's the largest selling beer in
Germany.  I guess that makes it the Budweiser of Germany... tastes about
as bad too as I recall from the pint I had at Laguna Seca :-)

regarding on what jim stadter had said

I think if it was going to cost that much money to build up the mercedes, i
would convert the power plant from a 928 to the mercedes.  Wouldnt that be
cool, a porsche powered mercedes

Charles B,   Yeah, I see your point, but is making some more money on an SUV
worth diluting the Porsche image? I'm trying to figure out why this idea turns
me off so much...................Ah, I have it.
Purebred sportscars and race cars. That's what I think of when I talk Porsche.
Not Grand Cherokees.  That just rubs me wrong and somehow lessens the whole
mental picture I have of Porsche AG. I would argue that there is a huge
difference between a 2-door and 4-door design. And again, it's image. I don't
think it's healthy for Porsche to convey an image that they are a 4-door
company. And the off-road 4-wheel drive stuff was only to test and refine
their 4wd road cars. Right now, Porsche's image is, ABSOLUTE WINNER.  Building
a 4-door or SUV screams FAMILY.  Das geht nicht. It just doesn't go.  Now
there's nothing wrong with a family, or family sedans or SUV's.  And I'm not
trying to be a snob about Porsches.  It's something like this:  I like
sardines. And I like ice cream. But I never think of putting sardines on my
ice cream. The two don't go together and the thought of them together is
revolting ( there's probably some guy in Winnipeg right now saying, "Hey, I
love sardines on my ice cream!" But hey, there's no accounting for taste.  And
I'm not some rich guy who can afford to burn a $100 bill.  But there are some
things even I wouldn't compromise for $100.  Anyway, it's just one opinion.
Take care and have fun with your Porsche,  Tim

to us!

For those who have not attended Dixie-Tech in the past, the event is held in a
club members huge shop, so speakers and attendees can get "hands on".

Huntsville is in northern Alabama, about 90 minutes from Nashville and the

Space and Rocket Center), and the Army's Aviation and Missile Command at
Restone Arsenal.  For those famialy members who will be coming, but not
attending, Huntsville offers several malls, a historical district, the Space
