I would like to understand, exactly, why increasing the width of a tire can
help to increase road friction (all else being equal).  The answer I've
gotten is "There is more surface area in contact with the pavement, so
there's more friction.  Duh."

To me this doesn't add up, for not one but two reasons:

Reason one: vaguely recalling my physics class, there's such a thing as a
"coefficient of friction".  Given a block resting on a surface, the lateral
resistance to force is proportional to the downward force applied to the
block by, for example, gravity.  As I recall, the area of contact was not a
factor when calculating lateral friction, which indicates to me that the
size of the contact patch should not be a factor.

Reason two: A wider tire shouldn't increase the contact area anyway.  Given
that the total area of the contact patch is a function of the downward force
on the tire and the air pressure within it, making the tire wider will serve
only to change the shape of the contact patch, not its area.

So much for theory.  Can some kind soul share the real physics behind this?

Thanks!
Forrest
