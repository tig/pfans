Brainstorm on anti-pond scum actions in private Porsche parking lot in
central Cambridge :-

1. Secure the lot with a chain + lock. Only valid parkers get key.
2. Cover car with cloth/plastic cover. (Nuisance for you to remove,
etc.)
3. Complain bitterly to car park authorities and get them to light lot
when dark.
4. Dog in the car?
5. Get lot authorities to put notice on lot wall exhorting people to be
good parkers and be considerate/careful with their bikes.
6. Park elsewhere - but knowing central Cambridge a little I suspect
that means far away.
7. Erect barriers around the car.

Good luck ..... Chris

It upsets me when I hear of this but to set the record straight The family was
rather apolitical, they designed a number of military projects but were not
involved in any way with anything unethical, Professor Porsche was imprisoned
by the French until his family was able to come up with enough of the Ransom
the French demanded and he was tricked into coming to France where baseless
charges were leveled,  The Professor did not fare well in the dingy cold
dungeon the r French kept him in and returned to Germany ill and never fully
recovered from his ordeal, it was one of the greatest injustices I have ever
heard of but what do you expect from the country that killed Princess Diana
