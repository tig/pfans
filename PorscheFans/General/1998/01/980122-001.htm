Time to retake physics class I think.=20

>Reason one: vaguely recalling my physics class, there's such a thing as =
a

Downward force IS a function of weight (here on earth, anyway) and can =
be expressed in PSI (pounds per square inch), but in an automobile, =
there are also lateral stresses that cause an increase in applied force. =
This is demonstrated everytime you turn a car. The weight (or inertia) =
is transferred to the outside wheels, the car rolls, the sidewalls flex, =
as the force increases.

>Reason two: A wider tire shouldn't increase the contact area anyway.  =
Given

Surface 'area' is just that, as measured by width and length. Hence a =
wider tire WILL cause surface area to increase. Air pressure only helps =
the tires support the vehicle weight, as well as maintain tire shape. =
Increasing air pressure will cause the tire to become more round, =
reducing the contact area. Just let the air out of your tires and =
observe what happens for a demonstration.

An increase in surface area actually causes there to be less PSI =
delivered. (Weight/Area) Try changing from skinny tires to wide tires on =
a wet surface for a demonstration of this.

So, why does everyone want wider tires? The ansewr is not friction. =
(resistance to motion) but one of 'stiction'. Believe it or not that IS =
an actual technical term for the force required to initiate 'friction'. =
'Stiction' is a function of surface area and weight, which is why we use =
rubber tires, and racers prefer soft composites on hard surfaces. Since =
tires are supple, they can conform to the road surface, thereby =
increasing contact surface area.

For a better description of 'stiction', check out a mechanical =
engineering textbook sometime.

This isn't meant as a 'flame' by any means, as I have pondered the same =
question.
(I know, I know, time to find a hobby!)
