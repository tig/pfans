I just solved a problem I have been having with the list, I subscribed a
few days ago and have been getting the digests, but when I tried to post
messages, I would get a message that I was not a member. I tried to
re-subscribe and was informed that I was already a member. I got no
answer from the listmaster so I tried to subscribe one more time, but
this time I changed the e-mail address. Even though I changed it to the
same address it seems to have worked. Hope this helps some newcomers out
there!

Ken, I'm not so sure it's our D.O.T (Feds) suppressing the exhaust note of the
cars  as much as it is the strict noise pollution countries like Switzerland.
Remember the RoW (Rest of World) codes?  It's easier for Porsche to make one
system that meets the strictest demands while making the rest suffer.  Oh,
well..    Take Care, Tim Comeau
