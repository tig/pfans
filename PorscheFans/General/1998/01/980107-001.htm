The CIR 2nd Annual Chili & Dessert Cookoff !

Saturday January 24: Arrive 4:30, Eat 5:30
     Ladies  and  gentlemen,  start  your..chili? Yep, get your competitive
engines  revving  up  with  the  CIR 2nd annual chili and dessert cook-off.
Here's  the  deal:  make  up a big pot of your best chilli (preferably in a
plug-in  pot) and/or dessert and bring it to Joyce and Harry Crane's place.
A  panel  of  professional tasters will give awards for best chili in mild,
wild  and  no  beans  categories plus a best open dessert category. Judging
promptly  at 5:30. International rules apply.  If you are not into cooking,
that's OK too, come on down and join the fun.
     Beverages,  sour  cream, onions, shredded cheese, and crackers will be
provided. Cost is a paltry $5 a person to cover costs.  If coming, call the
Crane's ASAP (317-875-0922) and let them know how many will be there.

Directions:  Take  I465  on  the west side of  Indy to 86th Street exit, go
west  on  86th  about 1/4 mile to Green Ridge Drive and turn right into new
"West  86th"  addition,  follow Green Ridge until it ends and turn right on
Harmon Ridge Court, look for house # 6326.

Dinner at Gisela's Kaffekranzen

Saturday February 7: 6:00 PM. Sharp!
     Nestled  in  historic  downtown  Zionsville  is one of the area's BEST
German  restaurants.  For  many  years, the CIR folks have gathered at this
homey place for authentic German food and drinks. I spoke with Andreas, the
owner,  who  told  me  that they would have the buffet available, with such
delicious  choices  as  sauerbraten,  schnitzel,  pork roulade, veggies and
more.  Of  COURSE  there are desserts!  (Yum)
     Dinner  cost is a bargain at $15.95 per person, beverages and desserts
extra.  Space is limited, so please call Mike or Sandra Farr ASAP
at (317-299-3643) to reserve your place.

Directions:  122  South Main Street, in downtown "old" Zionsville. Gisela's
is up the stairs on the second floor.
