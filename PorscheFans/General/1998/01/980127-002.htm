> I was wondering if anyone knows if/how Dr. Ferdinand Porsche and
his company were with Nazi Germany?  I've heard that Dr. Porsche spent
some time in a French jail for selling parts to the German government, but
I really don't know very much about it or even if it's true.  Anyone have
a good head for Porsche history?
======================================================

The good Doctor was quite involved with Hitler. The Volkswagen was designed for
the Nazis and they built the plants for them. Dr. Porsche also was involved with
the design of at least 2 tanks - the Tiger I turret and the 'King Tiger' and possibly
the 'Elefant'. Porsche also modified the VW for 4 wheel drive to be used by the 
Werhmacht. 

Of course Ford, GM, Chrysler, et. al. were heavy into manufactoring bombers, tanks,
fighters, and jeeps for the American military for what its worth.
