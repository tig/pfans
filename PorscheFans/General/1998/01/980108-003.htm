This subject came up a few months ago.  I believe that Briggs and
Stratton did a study on some of these after market additives.  Don't
quote me, I am just going by memory!  Seems to me the jist of what they
found out was that these additive people are not telling the whole
truth.  They say that with just a bit of their treatment you can drain
the oil out of an engine and continue to run it.  Well, what they don't
tell ya is that you can do the same with non-treated motor oil and the
engine survives for the same amount of time and in a few cases LONGER! 
They seem to imply that you can't drain the oil otherwise, but noone
asks that key question!

Anyway, that is what I recall.  If someone has the facts from a
bona-fide lab test, I'd like to hear about it!

IMHO, the additive package in any good motor oil has never been lacking.
