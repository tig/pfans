I seem to recall that Dr. Porsche and his brother-in-law Anton (?) Piech
were imprisoned in France.

Dr. Porsche's involvement in the Volkswagen (then KdF Wagen) project
apparently garnered him a fair amount of public exposure.  In a VW
documentary shown on Speedvision there is a film clip of Ferry Porsche
driving Hitler in an open beetle at some event celebrating the development
of the beetle (Hitler never learned to drive).

It is important to place these events in context and to remember the role
that Hitler and the German government played in auto racing in this era.  It
was largely extensive government sponsorship that produced the epic
Mercedes/Auto Union battles of the mid to late 1930's.  Dr. Porsche played a
key role in the development of the 520HP supercharged 6.1L V16 mid-engined
Auto Union "P" car (check out the model in the Automobile Atlanta catalog),
and it seems logical that the Nazi leadership sought to appear to be
affiliated with such a figure.

>Considering he was Austrian, not German, it is probably safe to say that
>he was not likely to be a "Nazi" in the traditional sense of the word. 

Well, considering that Hitler himself was Austrian, what is the
"traditional" sense of the word?  (FWIW, after becoming chancellor, Hitler
attained German citizenship by modifying the constitution to require that
the chancellor be a German citizen)

Does the design of cars and tanks for the military of a (ultimately
defeated) nation constitute "providing an unfair advantage?"  Is this a
valid charge under international treaties or is this just something
ludicrous that the French cooked up?

Dr. Porsche's "Nazi involvement" boils down to this:  Dr. Porsche, an
apolitical man, contributed his expertise to government and military
projects, at a time when almost everything was connected either to the
government or military, and the Nazi leadership tried to exploit his fame
for propaganda purposes.

BTW, "two passengers and a golf bag" rings true because the original
marketing strategy for the 356 relied almost exclusivly on personal contact
with wealthy aristocrats and the "golf bag" alludes to the perceived needs
of the customers.  One of the primary criteria for the 911 was that the new
model be able to accomodate "two adults with two children OR luggage."  I
have a German Porsche book which contains an interview with Ferry Porsche in
which he essentially disparages the 914 because of "unfortunate design
compromises" and laments that "one could not even fit a briefcase behind the
seats."  So, don't laugh when people tell you that the accomodation of
certain pieces of luggage play an important role in the design of Porsche
automobiles!  (This brings to mind the luggage space requirement for Le Mans
cars.  Was it Nissan who, in a recent event, was on the verge of withdrawing
because their car did not meet this spec?  Imagine ten world-class engineers
sitting around a table at Weissach saying "we need to build a car that will
beat McLaren and that pesky Joest, can survive Bob Wollek and, by the way,
there has to be room for a mid-size Samsonite.")
