Folks,

I think you are forgetting that Porsche does a huge amount of work for
other automobile companies and at least one motorcycle company. Porsche
has the knowledge to produce just about about any type of vehicle they
want and to do a very good job of it. If they choose to do an SUV with a
partner and put the Porsche name on it, so what? It's not going to hurt
the image of the 911 or the Boxster one bit.
