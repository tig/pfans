  I talked to a elect. eng. friend about this a while ago when I was trying
  to figure out the best way to keep the battery charged in my 928.  He felt 
  that a 1 volt drop was too extreme before having the charger kick on.  The 
  1.5amp recharge rate wasn't a problem though.
  
  I know that a 928 will not start with a battery at 11 volts; not sure whether
  the 911/930 is as finicky.  I opted to use a Schumacher fully automatic
  starter charger (SE-5212A) that I just hook up to the jumper terminals 
  whenever I park the car.  This has been working great.  Check out

I am planning a trip to Indy this year to visit my son, who is working there
temporarily. I thought it would be nice to go to the Indy 500 while there,
since I was in the neighborhood. I find that tickets are sold out at the
Speedway ticket office.

Does anyone have any advice on where to obtain them?

I understand that there are travel packages from Calif, but as my airfare is
already paid, so that's not a good option.

TIA
