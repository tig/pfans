Living north of the Toronto area my 78 930 goes into hibernation from December to 
April.I have always left the battery in the car as I normally start and move the 
vehicle every few weeks so that it keeps itself lubricated.

Every so often I find that the battery just doesn't have enough cranking power  
and sometimes has gone flat.

I am considering purchasing a Mity Mite Battery charger that directly and 
permanently hooks into the cars battery.It only comes on when the battery drops 
by one volt.It then recharges the battery at 1.5 amps until the voltage is back 
to normal.

My question is with this small charger hooked up permanently to the battery will 
it harm any electrical/electronic components in the car while it is in charge 
mode?

The product is sold by Performance Products and this little charger is in their 
Porsche catalogue.I have called them and they say that due to the very low 
amperage of 1.5 amps it will not hurt anything electrical on the car.They also 
claim to have sold 1200 units in 1997.

Any feedback would be appreciated!!
