To the physics debate, I humbly submit the following:

If the tire pressure and weight of the car remain the same, the total area
of rubber touching the ground will remain constant, regardless of the width
of tires.  This is proven by a simple balance of force vectors:
Force of car (Weight x gravitational constant g) = Total Area of rubber x
Average Tire Pressure.

Therefore, mounting wider tires will only alter the shape of the rubber
patch, not the area.  The new patch will be more "rectangular," i.e. the
"long" side will be perpendicular to the primary lateral force exerted on
the road by the tire while in motion.

The coefficient of friction is constant for two surfaces, i.e. this value
does not change with force or area.  What this means for us is that changing
the shape of the rubber patch (at constant area) should have no effect on
when a tire begins to slip.  Furthermore, the Cf cannot be derived, but is
an experimentally determined value.  I am sure that the Cf will vary greatly
with temperature and, of course, if you use a softer rubber compound.
I also think that, from a physics standpoint, there is no difference between
the frictional forces acting on, say, a pad of felt sliding on a smooth desk
and a tire on asphalt.  I performed that oft-mentioned experiment with a
soft rubber eraser and the results were consistent with all other objects.

Consider this: At equal tire pressure, a wider tire needs to deform less to
achieve the area described in the first paragraph above.  At every point in
its rotation, the tire is "squashed" a fixed radial distance, and this
deformation is work: force x distance.  For a wider tire the force is
constant, but the distance is less.  This effect will mean less sidewall
flex, more equal weight distribution and better road position, but does not
explain greater resistance to slipping.  I think that this is the most
significant effect.  At hard acceleration or sharp turns, the car will stay
much more stable and return more readily to a steady state.

This really is a complex problem because there are so many transient
factors, and it becomes difficult to isolate the dominant ones.
