Thom:

We lived in that area for many many years before we moved to Florida a year
ago, and have a 34' Motorhome that we used. You can show up in a 34 footer
at any of the first four below.  I simply don't know about no. 5.

Here's some suggestions:

1.  There is an RV park right in Laguna Seca, called Laguna Seca Recreation
Area, part of the Monterey County Park system, with 100 sites, that
actually overlooks the course.  Phone no. is (408) 755-4899.  (This might
be an availability problem on a race weekend)

2.  Marina Dunes RV Park.  A nice RV park, right on the beach, about 60
spaces, 9 miles no. of Monterey, and 15 miles from Salinas (probably about
10 miles from Laguna Seca).  Phone no. is (408) 384-6914

3.  There's a very large KOA (230 sites) south of Santa Cruz, actually in
Watsonville, 35 miles no. of Monterey, it is just off Hiway 1, so good
access into and to Laguna Seca.

4.  There's an outstanding beach State Park at Seacliff, just so. of Santa
Cruz.  It's our favorite place - you park right on a paved area at beach
level at the base of the cliff and edge of the beach and the view of
Monterey Bay at cocktail time, with the sun setting into the west is
awesome.  It's a Calif. State Park, and you have to call well in advance to
get a hook-up site to (800) 444-7275 (it's REALLY hard to get through!!)
However, if you are self-contained, you can almost always get into what
they call the "Overflow" area, same ambience, same view, same beach, just
no hookups.  (But lots of "beach" restrooms adjacent).  To inquire about
overflow spaces, call (408) 688-3222

5.  A small (20 sites) place in Monterey itself, called Cypress Tree Inn
(408) 372-7586

We have been to and would recommend any of the first four above.  Haven't
been to No. 5.

Wish we were going to be there with you!

Good luck

Tony Cook
