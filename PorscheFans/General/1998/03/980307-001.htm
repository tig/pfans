 I see that Porches of all kinds share all the problems. Although I love my
928
 and the attention it gets (Which is why we really get them). I am tired of
its
 monthly upkeep. So with that said I am waiting for my ride because my true
 blooded porsche is waiting for a waterpump and is sitting there being a
 Porsche.        SAL >>

WAH WAH WAH

Yeah...Porsches are the only cars with water pumps that fail. How many miles
are on that ride?  Maybe you should find another shop that understands how to
keep your car in front of the "failure curve".

Something about your post (maybe the way you misspelled Porsche) indicates
that your a nimrod unworthy of anything but  "Poser" transportation. Maybe you
should sell your P car and get a good used IROC with all the boy racer decals.
Maybe that will give you the sought after attention.  

Crybabies like you should be driving Toyota's or Hondas or used IROC's.

Warmest regards,

Steve R
Drives an extremely reliable 944 turbo, and does not complain about the normal
maintenance or the supercar performance.
