928s aren’t real Porsches some people say, others say that 944s and the 924
aren’t and more so state that the 914 aren’t.  Me, I don’t really care.  My
-3- 914s to my understanding were built in the Volkswagen plant and every one
arrived in the states with a Porsche name plate on it.  I only have one
question.  Are they fun to drive?  Generally yes.  I have to date never driven
a car that bared the name "Porsche" that was not fun to drive.  The 928 in my
opinion is one of the company’s most refined automobiles and a complete
pleasure to drive.  One that you can jaunt to the store with, take a cross
country trip with, take to your local drag strip, autoX, or take to the big
road tracks so well known across the country.  So for those of you that don’t
believe that the 928 is a real Porsche, don’t take the fun out of driving them
from the owner, by telling them that their car is fake.  And for those who
have never driven one, try it, you’ll like it!!
