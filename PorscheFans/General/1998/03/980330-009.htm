>>      I live here! Right across the street, buddy!" (Yes,
>>      astute viewers will have
>>      noticed the For Sale sign on the house earlier in
>>      the episode.) Seems an NBC
>>      executive saw an old clip of Kramer on Murphy Brown
>>      and looked Kramer up for
>>      his own sitcom. With a sure smile Kramer says "NBC
>>      has an opening on Thursday
>>      night. If I'm not "must see TV" no one is!" Jerry
>>      reminds him he has a "New
>>      York State of Mind" but Kramer just says, "I still

>>      Final Scene: Jerry's kitchen
>> 
>>      Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer are hanging
>>      out when the conversation
>>      turns to how lucky they all are. Each has achieved
>>      what they desired most.
>>      Then they realize each has no particular plans for
>>      the evening and how about a
>>      movie Of course, there is the usual squabbling
>>      until they pick the theater
>>      and time. All is really the same.
>> 
>> 
>>      Closing credits: Jerry's California street
>> 
>>      The street is quiet except for a mail truck
>>      going slowly from mailbox
>>      to mailbox. As the camera zooms in on the mail
>>      truck, now in front of Jerry?s
>>      box, we see the laughing face of ... NEWMAN!
