I just read with interest the recent exchange on the subject.

I do not claim any competence on the subject: I was infected recently with the
Porsche virus, driving my friend's '92 Carrera Cabrio through the Mountains in
Switzerland and at 150 mph on the German Autobahn...

Now I commute to work in a recently acquired 928S4, having been convinced by
the same friend (who also owned a 928 for 14 years!!) and many others that the
928 was 100% pure Porsche bred too.

If anybody has any doubt on this, he /she should try to drive one...even just
for a few miles!

My 200 miles daily roundtrip (crazy, huh? I know!) is just plain and absolute
Porsche fun!

And just take a look at the shop manuals...that's what I read before going to
sleep...!
