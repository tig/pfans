Hello P-Fans
	
	PCNA has just released two new Porsche books. Get while they are hot off the
presses....

	"New '99 M.Y. 996 Service Information Booklet". Covers all the tech stuff on
Porsche's newest water cooled model. Porsche Part#PNA-499-921

	"New '98 Porsche Heritage Self-Study Book". This book is filled with all of
the landmarks of the Porsche family cars both for the street and for the
track!  Porsche Part#PNA-000-155

	I do not know the cost of these books since they were given to me by a friend
at the local Porsche dealer. It never hurts to have too many friends, ehh? I
think they are in the $10-$20 range. Just a note, some of the pictures are not
up to Porsche's past intro book quality. It kind of looks like they had
Kinko's do the color coping! But there is plenty of good information for the
Techno-head P-Fan....
