To all the 'in the know 914 people'
This problem has been answered sooo many times, yet I have failed to read
it since it wasn't my problem. 914 2.0 Tach that bounces along as I drive.
I know that the answere is simple and it is out there!! 
Next on the list. I have this hard to push clutch cable and it sounds like
it is binding at the tunnel or peddle cluster. Along with this is a
throttle cable that is also hard to push and also makes the same binding
sound. I have: Checked to make sure the cables are not crossed in the
tunnel.
               Rewelded a broken Bowden tube twice.
               Installed bronze peddle bushings. 
               Replaced both the cables.
When I release the throttle spring, the initial push on the throttle has
resistance. Once the cable is pulled in by the throttle peddle, the peddle
flops around freely(with the spring off) This makes me believe the problem
is not in the peddle cluster. Replace the spring and the throttle squeeks
with both the in push and release.Hmmmmmmmm.
Clutch cable squeeks and binds also. I'm getting tired of sighting down
the tunnel with a mirror and pulling the cables out to check for wear.
I enjoy flying along in the 914 and it is a joy to autocross. I like it
more than my carrera. But, I haven't been able to locate the source of
this problem and when the cables are working smoothly, they are so easy to
push and the car is great to race around in. Any ideas would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks,
                    Randy
