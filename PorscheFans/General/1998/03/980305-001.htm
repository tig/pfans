Hello Phil & P-Fans
	Have you seen the Dec., 1995 issue of Pano? Page 106, and I will quote: " In
Nov. '74, a year latter than originally planned, the 928 received final
approval - but only after the engine was reduced to 4.5 liters and 240 hp to
improve fuel economy".  Yea right! I know it was the height of gas crunch but
come on.... So the 4.5 liter engine got how many more miles to the tank? Maybe
2 mpg? Hah!
	I just read between the lines here. Maybe it was just for gas mileage, but
how come it took Porsche until '86 M.Y. to come out again with a 5.0 liter
engine? If it was just mpg, we would of seen a 5.0 liter plus design way
before '86 M.Y. . The only logical answer would be the Hp question! 

Just my 2 cents worth.
