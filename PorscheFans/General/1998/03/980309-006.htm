<<I have just purchased a 76 Carrerra 3.0. Last night it blew oil around the
motor and into the airbox,it was dripping from what seemed like everywhere.>>

As a new 911 owner, you may not know that the oil level is checked HOT, at
idle. If someone filled a stopped engine until the dipstick read full ( don't
laugh, I heard of Jiffylubes who have done this), you will probably have 17
quarts in an 10.5 quart system, with predictable results.

If you aren't sure, it may pay to drain the system (both drain plugs) and
refill. Use a clean container with a BIG opening and large capacity, and you
should be able to reuse the oil.

Upon refilling, I would put in 9 quarts, (10 less 1 for the filter that wasn't
changed), and then check the level with the engine at operating temperature.
The proper level is normally halfway between the 2 marks on the dipstick. Use
this level to calibrate your dash guage.
