I have just purchased a 76 Carrerra 3.0. Last night it blew oil around the
motor and into the airbox,it was dripping from what seemed like everywhere.
The motor is fresh. I suspect a vent line problem,any ideas? I tried to get to
the pressure switch and I believe it was dry ( it rained all day so I could'nt
get into it too much). I checked the breather hose adjacent to the oil
thermostat and it was tight. Do you think that it could be too much oil and
it's spitting out the excess?  While the rings are seating,is it possible to
have enough blow by to dump oil into the airbox?
         While driving,the gearbox makes a winding noise,it's constant after
2k rpm and up.? I checked the fluid ,it was good. The gearbox was rebuilt
recently.Backlash off? Any ideas?  Thanx for any help in advance! 
               PS. I did'nt get a chance to gunk the motor yet,in case you're
wondering.
