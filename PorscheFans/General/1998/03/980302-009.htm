Hello P-Fans

Since my first posting(s) got garbled (I'm going to dump AOL, soon!), I a=
m=0Aposting again to the list server.


Here is a listing of the landmark Porsche models that I know about. There=
=0Aprobably is some models that I left out. (?)  I did not list every sin=
gle=0Aderivitives of each model line; ie 944, 944S, 944S2. 

If anyone knows of a web site that shows a listing, like this, please e-m=
ail=0Awith the address. 

Please feel free to correct any mistakes that I might have made. ?
