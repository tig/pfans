Well, I can't quite believe it, but while cleaning out my shop I dicovered a
treasure trove of old manuals I no longer need.  I'll toss them out for the
group in case you other P-nuts are like me and into interesting cars beyond
Porsche's; sorry for the band width for those of you who arn't.   Hard to
imagine that every one of these has graced the garage at some time, but in
raising four boys, all of whom grew up to be car nuts, I guess eclecticism
just goes with the territory.  If you are interested, the prices are plus
shipping and go down as the quantity goes up.  I also have a bunch of Saab
specialty tools if any of you wrench 96s and 99s.
