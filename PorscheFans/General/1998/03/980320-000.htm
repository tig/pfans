Paul,
    If your working in America, your probably working WAY to hard, and there
are many reports that say the same thing.  We work harder and have less free
time than ever before, but look on the bright side I would rather be working
hard, than looking hard for work.  There is a reason why the stock market is a
high as it is, because millions of us are working are rumps off to keep up.  I
work 80-100 hours a week, and this doesn't include keeping up the homestead,
shopping, etc. etc.
Which leaves little time to do what I really want, which is drive my Porsche!,
but you need to get away for a day or two, no elaborate planning, just get in
the car and go, but don't take off to much time or the work will pile up while
your gone, and you will feel worse trying to catch up.  Remember you must work
to live, but you need not live to work.  
.
