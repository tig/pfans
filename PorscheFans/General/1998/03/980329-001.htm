The inly time i have driven in europe was ina Czech made Skoda ( which btw
in czech means " what a pity ", no joke.) but believe me tehre are plenty of
rads that are a real blast, but before we get tinto that. 

Crime,  wach your stereo, i have had about 9 stolen while travelling, two in
teh same day once. A club might be a good idea, but only to beat the head in
of a would be thief, there are pretty much worthless against an expierienced
thief. Berlin isnt really that bad ether.

Good road, in france the road from Nice to Monoco is absolutely fantnastic (
remember the opening seens to "Golden Eye" and then on to Ventimiglia form
monoco. Also an exceptionaly awsome road ( for beuty) is from Dresden to
Prague going through Decin. I know these two roads are far apart from each
other, but they are both well worth it.
