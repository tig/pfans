Hello P-Fans
	A friend of mine has a '94 US legal C-2 Turbo-S 911. The car has what is
called the "S-2" option. He says it has something like 485 hp!  The Turbo-S
had 381 bhp so what more has been done to the motor? I've seen two 911 (964's)
C-2 Turbo-S models and they do not look like my friends car. 

	My friends car Looks just like most C-2 Turbo-S except it has these 959-like
intake scoops on each rear quarter pannel, deleted fog lights with brake ducts
in their place, thin glass, 18" polished wheels, it has dual exhaust tips on
each side, each side tips are siemesed together. My friends car has the
regular front end, but he says they were something like 120 Turbo-S cars built
and only 23 did not have the slant nose option! 

	Can any one confirm these things for me? I have Paul Frere's Book: "Porsche
911 Story" and it says that only 81 Turbo-S C-2's were built. ??? My friends
car looks just like the car pictured on page #299 if it helps anyone? 

a curious P-Fan!
