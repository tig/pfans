Folks,
Sometimes vandalism is random and sometimes not.  If your behavior (on or off
the road) has offended someone who knows where you park your beloved P-car,
then the vandalism may not have been random.
Certainly this is a cowardly way to get back at you, and a person who chooses
to retaliate against a defenseless vehicle for the (real or imagined) offenses
of its driver is almost beyond our understanding.
But we must live in the world as it is, not as we would like it to be, and if
checking your 6 will help avoid future problems it can be a very cost-
effective tactic.
