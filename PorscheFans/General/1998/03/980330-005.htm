Hi Yall
This message is in reply to "BrianChiko"'s inquiry about where it drive
in Europe.I am sending to the General list because others who are
planning to visit the Fatherland to pick up their cars might find
something  that will be useful also.
I  was lucky enough to be able to spend 8 years living in  Germany (68
to 72,and 80 to 84),and therefore had plenty of time to explore the
roads and take in the glorious scenery,but I will try to keep this msg.
relatively short,and invite any and all who are going  over to email me
if they have questions-bearing in mind that the last time I was there
was in 1995 (on a vacation).
IMHO,the best roads/countryside to explore are mostly to be found in the
Black Forest and Sudbayern (south Bavaria).Fortuneatly,they are both in
the extreme south of  Germany,contiguous with one another. Shoot (below
4000 rpms,please)down the Autobahn from Stuttgart toward Karsrhue,then
stay overnight in BadenBaden (or NEAR it-it,s very expensive .Stay in a
German "zimmer frei",which are rooms available to travelers in private
homes.
Explore the Black Forest-this could take WEEKS-but the roads are quite
fantastic.I spent many happy weekends exploring the limits of tire
adhesion on them.
Take the Deutsche Alpine Strasse (German Alpine Road) from there
eastward to Oberbayern-south Bavaria,checking out castle
Neuschwanstein,Oberammergau,then to Garmisch/Partenkirchen.Ride the
cable car up to the Zugspitze,Germany's highest mountain-(if  it's a
clear day).
Continue on the Alpine Strasse to Berchtesgaden,then down  into
Austria.Zell am See-,the Porsche famiy's home ,is very close by.The
scenery is breathtaking.
In Austria,be sure to find and drive over the Grossglockner -this is
where you will discover what Porsche's do better than all the rest!High
speed mountain driving.
There is lots more I could share.but I've already used up  too much
bandwidth.
(My apologies to anyone who was offended by this).
Any one who wants to contact me may do so thusly:
cjohnson@supernet.net
Best wishes to all.,and remember that anytime you have 2 regular cars
driving in a row,that's all you have.Anytime you have 2 Porsches doing
it ,you have a FORMATION!
