David Jalai, 
the 1973 turbo 2.142cc (?)  Carrera was not the car referred to as "baby."
That nick-name was given to a 935 in 1976 or 1977 which had a smaller than
normal engine. If I remember correctly, the reason for the smaller engine was
so that it could compete with the BMW's in their class. Seems there was no
competition for the regular 935's, so they looked elsewhere for some ass to
kick!  "Baby" is easily recognized as a 935 but can be distinguished from
other 935's by it's different (lesser) bodywork. See "Excellence was expected"
or "The Porsche Book", great references for Porsche loonies like us.   Cheers.
