I assume this book is to the 996 what the "Boxster '97 Service Information
Technik" book was to the Boxster.

Here is something to consider:  

What people may not realize is that it seems Porsche only offers these books
when a new model is introduced.  The Boxster Service Information Technik
book is now out of print at (at the moment) Porsche apparently has no plans
to reprint it.

It seems the make it when the car first comes out so that each dealership
can buy copies.  After they think dealerships have all the copies they need,
the stop printing it.

I was lucky to just find a Boxster Service Information Technik book via the
internet (heard about it at a non-local dealer via Porsche Pete's Boxster
Board http://www.yardbyyard.com/boxster/) but I doubt there are any left to
be found in the country now.

So, plan to get a 996, you should probably buy this book now rather than
wait.
