If you stay in Hotels in smaller towns and villages there won't be a
problem 
and the prices and the service are also much better there.

The place is called Monaco (and not monoco), and that is indeed a
beautiful road.
If you are going in that direction you should also drive the "Route
Napoleon" from
Castellane to Grasse. This is also known as the Gorge du Verdon. When
you drive
down from Northern Europe you can also take the entire Route Napoleon
which 
starts in Grenoble and goes to Gap and Sisteron and then on to
Castellane and 
Grasse.
