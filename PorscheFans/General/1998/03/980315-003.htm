Hello Nill & P-Fans,
	I believe that all the 356 Polizie cars were cabriolets. When Porsche came
out with the Targa model, the German Polizie & Demark Police Depts.. switched
over to the Targa model. I remember reading about how the Polizie wanted a
high speed, high profile car, the Cabriolet & Targa models fit this to a bill.
I also believe the Polizie only assigned the Porsche Polizie cars to their
elite drivers. They had to under go special training to drive the expensive
Porsche's, especially  when it came to shifting gears.  Any damage to the
cars, and they were booted back to drive lowly Volkswagen/Golfs! Also, these
Polizie officers spoke at least five languages because they patrolled
Autobahns linking many counties together. 
	The Sept '96 Pano has a short one page blurb on the 356 and a new 993 given
to the Polizie as a gift of appreciation. The Pano story says that the
100,000th 912 Targa was made for the German AutoBahn Polizie, for the "Baden-
Wurttemberg" state (or part of Germany where Porsche is made). On July 15th,
1996, Ferry Porsche presented a 993 done up in all the Polizie colors to the
"Baden-Wurttemberg" state officials as a gift, celebrating the 1,000,000th
Porsche produced to date! 

Hope this sheds more light on the topic?

Good Luck
