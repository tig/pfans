V-16?? When did Porsche do one of those? They did do a boxer 16 for the
917 Can Am project but never did anything with it but run it on the
dyno.

Hello P-Fans,

	Ferdinand Porsche DID design the AutoUnion Grand Prix Cars! On Nov 15th, 1932
the design specs were drawn up. Hitler and the Nazi's backed the project for
German pride and properganda reasons. On Jan 12th, 1934 the car competed at
AVUS track. Ferdinand Porsche's mid-engine design caused a sensation! The
crankshaft (a roller bearing crankshaft design) had some 10,000 parts to its
design! Some of the latter models even had two tires on each side of the rear
axle (four on one axle) to aid with traction and grip. 
	Ferdinand Porsche has been quoted as saying the Beetle was more complicated
car to design and develop than the famous AutoUnion cars!
	The type "A" models had a 16 cylinder 45' Vee engine and had one camshaft for
each bank of cylinders, together with a supercharger, tubular frame,
innovative torsion-bar suspension. The type "A" with 4.35 liter engine
developed 295 hp @4,500 rpms, imitating just how much scope this engine
offered for development in the years ahead. Latter a 375 hp @4,800 rpms from a
4,951 cc displacement, called a type "B". 	On May 26th, 1935 Hans Stuck (Sr.)
drove a AutoUnion Grand Prix car at AVUS to a record the fastest lap of 260.53
kph! In March 1936 Stuck broke three world records and four international
class records. Over distances of between 50 kph and 100 miles he reached an
average speed of 269 kph! 
	The type "C", a had 16 cylinder producing 520 hp. In various races they were
clocked at 255 kph in qualifing, and in the a race lap time of 283.7 kph.
AutoUnion also had a "areo-body" (covered wheel openings) for this model that
broke all new world records. On Oct 25-29,1937 Rosemyer drove this model to a
new world class record of 406.3 kph on a closed course section of autobahn
just south of Frankfurt.
	In Nov, 1937 Mercedes-Benz announced that they would "conduct" tests or
attemps to break AutoUnion's world speed records. AutoUnion would no allow MB
"attempts" to go unchallenged. 
	AutoUnion came up with a 560 hp ( the old record car had only 520 hp!) for
the MB challenge. The body had less drag and lift. MB driver Caracciiola on
the morning of Jan 28th, 1938, drove to a new world record of 432.692 kph
(428.571 kph & 436.873 kph, average) average. Despite increasing winds that
day and warnings from the AutoUnion's engineers not to run, Rosemyer decided
to go ahead with his record attemp. On the first leg he clocked up 429.491
kph. On the return leg he crashed his AutoUnion. A side gust of wind caught
the car at the 8th kilometer, and tossed it to pieces. Rosemyer died. The
AutoUnion car was clocked at 430 kph at the 8th kilometer! He surely would of
broken MB previous run, but never finished the last leg. There is even a plack
on the side of the AutoBahn rest stop, just south of Frankfurt to this day.

	As for the 16 cylinder Can-Am engine (1969 & 1970), there were actually four
displacement sizes (from 6.0L to 7.2L's) developed by Porsche. The engines
shared the same basic components, such as cylinders, pistons, valves, rods,
bearings. Essentially a twelve cylinder with four more cylinders, except for
inlet tubes/horns leaned outward instead of flat like the twelve. Parts were
available to produce ten such engines. The 16 cylinder engines are on display
at the following Museums: Porsche Museum, Deutes TechNik Museum in Munich,
Rosso Binaco Museum outside Frankfurt, and at the Rennsport Museum at
Nurburgring Track. 

Output and Displacement of the 16-cylinder:

	a 6.0L: 5992cc 770hp@8400 rpms
	a 6.6L: 6543cc 800hp@8400 rpms
	a 6.7L: 6665cc 840hp@8300 rpms
	a 7.2L: 7166cc 880hp@8300 rpms
 
	There was even talk about a 16 cylinder turbo charged version having in
excess of 2000 hp!!! Talk about an unfair advantage! 


	Hope this sheds more light on the 16-cylinder cars.
