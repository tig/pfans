In my quest to reorder a P69 car I have come across several Boxsters
that are available for either purchase or  ordering.

This dealer has one on the ship due to arrive within several weeks:

Arena red,  full supple grey leather, P63, Heated seats, P15 (power
seats), Driver's Lumber and a hardtop. He is VERY willing to deal on
this car. Offered it too me at a sizable discount. It was not exactly
what I wanted, so I refused. He siad the  car could be shipped to me for
$1 per mile one way.

He has several  (2-3) in the build process with P63 (sports package) and
a  few low cost options (cd shelf etc) that he will have available.

And finally he has 1 May, 2 June and 2 July allocations to be
configured. He is caught up with his waiting list.

The guy with whom I spoke was very very nice and I am posting this
information as a favor to him. I offered to do this, and will receive NO
payback or reward, from the sale of these cars,  other than the pleasure
of knowing that I helped a nice HONEST dealer sell a car and someone to
car before the start of SUMMER.


You may e-mail me,  felker@tcsx.net ,  with questions  etc!

Or the dealer/salesmanager: David Ingram at: dallred@lwtcom.com or
