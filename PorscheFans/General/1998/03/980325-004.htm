Hi Ron,

As a club officer it strikes me that we have clubs/groups in many countries
all of whom have magazines/websites. A lot struggle to fill theirs as it is
invarably the same members who contribute articles time and time again.

WOULD ANYBODY BE INTERESTED IN "TWINNING" SOME OF THESE CLUBS WITH THOSE IN
OTHER COUNTRIES SIMILAR IN THE WAY THEY DO WITH TOWNS?

AS WELL AS HELPING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL CLUBS.

WE COULD HAVE A RECIPRICAL ARRANGEMENT TO ALLOW US TO USE ONE ANOTHERS
ARTICLES.

ASSIST EACH OTHERS MEMBERS IF THEY CAME TO VISIT OUR OWN COUNTRIES.

IT COULD EVEN BE THE START OF A SORT OF UNION OF PORSCHE CLUBS WHICH WOULD
HAVE WAY MORE CLOUT TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS SUCH AS OBTAINING SPECIAL OFFERS OR
DISCOUNTS.
