Dear Fellow Porschers,


The Passing of the legendary Ferry Porsche is indeed a sad and tragic event,
however, judging by the lengths that Ferry went to, to instill joy in the
driving public, he would want us not to weep, but rather rember with joy.  He
lived a good and productive life and we should never forget him.  So, in
keeping with the spirit that Ferry instilled in all of those cars in our
garages, we should try and enjoy our time on the road a bit more.  We should
remeber him as he would like to be remembered; along with out joy.  I like and
agree with the idea that we should drive this week with our head lights on.
He has taught us so much about what a car should be, what a driving experience
should be, and now he has taught us one more important lesson...Life is
finite...Get out there and enjoy it while you can.

Seth
