<< I'm wondering if I need anything else - for example something like the
"club" or something to deter theft. >>

The "Club" is a good idea...but spending the night OUTSIDE of major cities in
rural hotels (with usually a covered+ closed garage for the guests)  is an
even better idea!
It is also MUCH cheaper! Local owners have their pride in their establishment
and will make sure you enjoy your stay!
Germany, Austria and Switzerland have those kind of places  literally in every
village. You'll get personal service....and at least people will notice your
car and compliment you about it!!

<<Lastly, are there any great roads that you'd recommend driving in Europe -
perhaps you know of some particularly beautiful, curvy roads that would be
a fun drive.>>

Make sure you get yourself a good dose of German Autobahn (so at least you can
check what your car was designed for!!)

I have to share here how I got the Porsche "Virus": 

I drove my friend's '92 911 Carrera cabrio up the Gotthard pass in Switzerland
(the old road from Erstfeldt, over Andermatt, then  to the old refuge on the
summit) and on down South to Airolo.

DON"T USE THE the UGLY and BORING (60 mph) freeway and 10 miles long two lanes
smelly tunnel!!
Turned back and drove over the Nueffenen Pass to Bryg... 
Do it in the week (light traffic) on a nice clear day...and stop a few times
to smell the Alpine scents, admire the vistas...but also tolet you heart rate
get back to normal!!
Just watch for cyclists, they too are trying to have some fun, but only have a
0.3 HP engine !
Have fun...for yourself and all of us! And bring us a lot of great stories!
