356rs, 912rs, hell, Porsche ENTHUSIASTS

As a 912,914, 911 owner  (and 356 "wannabe" owner) I heard of Ferrys'
passing with sadness and joy together...

I trust Chris Stavros' comment is right about the last 993, the last air
cooler, rolling off the line on the same day, yes thats spooky...makes you
wonder if he didn't subsconsciously "time it" that way.  The thing that had
lately caught my attention was that his first "Porsche" (built in
conjunction with his pop) was a silver mid-engined 2-seater and that
(basically) the "last" car he'd ever see would be the fantastic
Boxter-another mid-engined two seater (most of 'em I imagine will be
Silver)...now, to me THATs an omen.  and thats' not all bad.

Without benefit of ever having met The Man...In my own twisted way, I sorta
understood where he came from. To me, he had always epitomized "The Art Of
Living", if only by building a product that none of us need but we all
covet.  I think to be honest and fair to his memory, we should celebrate
his life and go DRIVE, and take somebody with you at that...(and remember
to use the "Porsche salute"-flash the headlights @other Porsches
encountered)

Thanks Ferry

Cheers
Thom Kuby
