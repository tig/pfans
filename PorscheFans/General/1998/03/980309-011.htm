Just a little hystory

Some time ago, there was a mention of a V12 that had been mistaken for the
flat 12.  Many people had mentioned that Porsche had never produced a V engine
at all.  It appears however that there was a 1.5 liter liquid cooled V10 type
114 produced in 1938 as a prototype for the type 114 race car and a 15-liter
air-cooled V10 produced for the type 100 prototype tank that was never to be
put into full production.  Their reasons for the V10 were as stated "shorter
than a V12 and yet offering more power through higher speeds than a V8 of
equivalent displacement".

Just thought it was kinda cool, found it in a OLD book.
