    David:

    Porsche made them both ways.

    If you have a copy of Bruce Anderson's "911 Performance
    Handbook", you can see pictures of the two versions on pages 214
    and 215 [in the first edition, anyway; I don't know if those
    photos even appear in the second edition].

    No.  Brake cooling is generally accomplished by ducting air from
    the front airdam directly to the brake discs; the louvers in the
    fenders improve the car's aerodynamic performance by relieving
    the relatively high pressure that forms over the tires.
