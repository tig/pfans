I'm a new 912E owner (in fact, it's my first rear engined Porsche). 
Mine is a solid example -a strong daily driver if I wanted to use it 
as such. It has about 128K miles, so it has been cared for, but not 
coddled. Last weekend I took it on a "shake-down" cruise. I drove 
across Texas and back, to the tune of about 1,500 miles. I noted a 
few things (mostly things I already knew) that may need attention. 
I'm pretty green when it comes to the 912, so if any of you have 
comments, advice or tips about what I noted, let me know. I'm not 
mechanically inclined, but I am a slow learner (ha ha)! I've owned 
used Porsches before, so I'm not too freaked out by a few projects 
(just so long as it doesn't become a monetary black hole like that 
'84 944 was). 

1) The light lever must need to be replaced. It kept slipping from 
low to high beams. I've been told this is a common problem. I 
understand that Performance products carries the part. Let me know if 
you've replaced this switch, and how to go about it.

2) The speedometer is off. I think it's more accurate at low speeds, 
but is far too optimistic at higher speeds. When my wife can find 
some time, we'll pace it with her car. The speedo had me going "75" 
to "80" mph when I was probably somewhere between "60" and "70". 
Obviously, I don't have stock sized tires. It still has tires that 
the previous owner had put on, Michelin P205/70R14. Strangely, the 
odometer appeared to be accurate.

3) By the time I got to College Station I noticed that the throttle 
would sometimes stick at just above 2K rpm. A quick upshift and 
release of the clutch would bring the rpms down. Of course, I only 
noticed this in towns. The springs associated with the throttle 
appear to be doing their thing back there. A guy in College Station 
sprayed them with some toxic smelling stuff, to clean the gunk off. 
It helped, and I noticed the throttle sticking less. By the time I 
got home, I didn't notice it at all. If I observe it again I'm 
thinking the throttle might have some gunk on the inside.

4) I knew this before the trip, but I'll add it in here. The shift 
linkage has some slop in it. In neutral, the shift lever feels 
completely loose. Doesn't seem to be a big problem, but I have 
noticed that if you aren't gentle, there can be a pronounced "clunk" 
when you select first gear.

5) The thing that bothered me the most was the car's tendency to pull 
to the right. It seems to be worse sometimes than others. Texas has 
horrible crosswinds. The car appears to be sensitive to these winds 
or turbulence. The last 400 miles of the trip was particularly brutal 
because of this. I'm hoping a front end alignment will be the answer. 
My other guess is possibly some wear in the steering that allows too 
much play. To my knowledge, the car hasn't been in an accident. My 
buddy said the front end on his '88 911 tended to wander around too; 
but I don't think it was as dramatic as what mine did. This is one of 
those odd things, in that I don't notice it all the time. 

A note about my trip. I drove from El Paso to Texas World Speedway in 
College Station. The Lonestar Region of PCA was holding club races, 
and I thought this would be a good excuse to drive out there. A buddy 
of mine (who I haven't seen in seven years) said he would meet me 
there. I told him to look for a brownish (Peru Red) 912E. I said it 
would be "the only one there." Well, the first Porsche I saw when I 
drove up was a brown 912E. Not only was there another one there, this 
guy was the first owner, and his was in Concours condition. I thought 
mine was pretty clean until this guy showed me his; pointing out 
exactly which upholstery panels had been replaced on the seats. He 
was out of my league, but hey, I've only had mine a couple months. He 
has had 22 years to study his. His awesome 912E was made less than a 
hundred before mine (both being near the middle of production). The 
irony of the entire situation was not lost on me. I had driven across 
the huge state of Texas to the one place I would be guaranteed to 
have no-one fawn over my car. I enjoyed the trip, but have decided 
that was a little too far to go solo. Assuming the odometer was 
correct, I got 23 mpg on twisty backroads, nearly 28 mpg on the 
interstate. Thanks for any comments. If you're going to flame me, 
send to ELXN03B@prodigy.com (fifth figure is a number).
