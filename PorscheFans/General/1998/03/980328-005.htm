Hi folks,

I just found a great web site with the full contents of a book on driving
in Europe - it looks like it has all the information I need.  If you'll be
doing the tourist delivery I highly recommend you download and read the=
 book:

One specifically interesting quote:

hmmm... something to think about.

Brian.

If you plan to drive a BMW or the like, you may be justified in fearing the
criminals of Southern and Eastern Europe. As such, one compromise option
to consider in the initial stages of planning your journey is the
following: take
the trains in Southern and Eastern Europe and drive in northwest Europe. Not
only is crime more prevalent in Southern and Eastern Europe, but the train
tickets are much cheaper there as well. For example, the number of
kilometers you can travel per dollar in various countries or sections of
Europe
are as follows: Turkey=9740 km; Eastern Europe=9717 km; Spain=9713 km;
Italy=9712 km; France=9710 km; Germany=978 km; Scandinavia=977 km;
England=976 km. To take advantage of these price gradients, you'd have to
buy point-to-point train tickets or single-country passes instead of
inter-country passes. Besides the issues of crime and rail fares, there's=
 the
issue of language. The populations of Southern and Eastern Europe do not
speak English with anywhere near the frequency or skill as do the=
 populations
of Europe's northwest. In the northwest you can realize the full potential=
 of
your motor vehicle by getting out to meet and actually converse with the
people who don't see tourists very often. I've already mentioned that it's
better
to buy a vehicle in the northwest. Well, if you do buy, staying in that=
 region
with the vehicle will keep your fuel costs down, and if any problems
arise=97and they are less likely to arise in the more temperate,=
 industrialized
and Anglicized northwest=97you can deal with them much easier. Defining the
limits of your itinerary on a more geological basis, however, may be the=
 best
approach. Here's an idea: Don't drive south of the great mountain ranges=
 (the
Alps and the Pyr=E9n=E9es) or east of the former Iron Curtain. You'll want=
 the
motor vehicle in the mountains, however, to propel you up into beautiful
scenery and hard-to-get-at hideaways.=20
