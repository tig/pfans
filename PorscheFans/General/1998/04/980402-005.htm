My name is Simon Losel and I am a huge Porsche lover.I have a question 
that I am hoping someone could help me with because I haven't been able 
to find the answer to it.Here goes,I read that the Porsche 911 was 
origionally going to be called the 901, but wasn't because Peugot had a 
copyright on all 3 digit numbers with a zero in the middle right? But 
what about the Porsche models 904,906,907,908, and 909? Wouldn't these 
models be infringing on the copyright? Or is it because these cars are 
racecars, they are exempt from the copyright? Well I am confused and 
would appreciate any information that anyone could send me concerning 
the subject.Thank you.
