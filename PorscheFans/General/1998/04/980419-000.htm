>Can anyone recommend a good "Affordable" arc welder.
Forget it Mike - get a MIG welder.  They need less skill to get a =BD dec=
ent
job and you can get a 'gasless' one for about the same cost as an ARC
welder.  Practice on some small off-cuts before trying to patch your belo=
ved
Porsche though ;-)

>Not sure that I can afford or find a MIG welder that I can use on standa=
rd
>household current without putting in 220. Tips or suggestions?
MIG welders actually use (considerably) less current than ARC welders Mik=
e.
MIGs also create much less spread heat than ARC, making carpet fires, mel=
ted
door seals and general fires etc less likely (you still need to have an
extinguisher (co2 not water) handy and lift flammables out of the way whi=
lst
working of course) they can also be used without disconnecting that batte=
ry
and alternator (US - generator?).  If you use a gas MIG, don't attempt it
outside if there is any sort of breeze and this will destroy the inert ga=
s
cone around the welding tip and make your best welding efforts look like
bird droppings splattered on the metalwork!

Look at
http://webmaster.daytonatrophy.com/daytonamig/110%20Volt%20mig%20welders.=
htm
l to see sub $300 110v MIGs.  Also try the classified ads in trade magazi=
nes
and the like for second hand equipment for real bargains (always insist o=
n a
test and proof of ownership before purchasing).  Tools are a great exampl=
e
of you-get-what-you-pay-for!  Avoid anything new if it is *too* cheap.  I=
f
cost is an issue try somewhere like http://www.jclarmachinery.com/home.ht=
ml
as they supply used and bankrupt equipment.
MIG doesn't seem to give out as much UV either, so a 'mask flash' where y=
ou
don't cover your face with the mask quite quickly enough will not be as
painful! To avoid such problems you may want to look at
http://www.accustrike.com/mig.htm   -  I hope that this helps.
