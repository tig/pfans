Hello P-Fans

PORSCHE sells a small Tech-Bulletin guide book. Its the same size as the
technical specs book. It has a yellow 993 on the cover. It covers all cars
built to date arrange by number of engine cylinders! This is the KEY to
looking up ANY bulletin!!! The key the "Holly Grail" so to speak!

I do not have a part number for this book - yet, but I did order one from my
dealer last week. Try your P-Dealer or someplace like MY-Porsche to order one.

Good Luck
