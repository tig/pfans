told him, yep, the exhaust rattles now. Too bad. I had Autocar Sports

front rotors, transaxle oil, and checking the timing belts. $650

They found that the CO test pipe was broken (a normal failure and of =

consequence except probably at a concours) and capped, and that the =
dealer

had put a little ball bearing under the cap. It rattled. The ball =
bearing has=20

been replaced with a larger one and the rattle is gone. This is the

only case I know of where the muffler bearing was actually causing a =
problem.

Still have the 1987 phone dials and 1986 computers for sale.
