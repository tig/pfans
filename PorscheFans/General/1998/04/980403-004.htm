I know some people will SCREAM when they hear what i say, but even though i
LOVE my Porsche, and would not want to part with it any time soon.  There are
others MFGs that produce similer performance machines.  If Porsche doesnt want
to play, FU#K em and lets play with some one who wants the publicity.!!  GM
and Callaway produce a wonderful new Corvett with a transaxel and for the
budget minded people (like my self) the Miata and the RX7 are killer cars and
there are plenty of up grades availible for them.  Some people get all winded
up in a marque but its just a company that cares for one main thing,
,,,,,,,,,DOLLARS in their pocket.  

Just my two bits, please dont critisize me for my opinion.
