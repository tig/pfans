Hello P-Fans

Next months issue onVanity Fair (on sale today/Thursday in NYC and everyw=
here=0Anext week) has a photo of Jerry=92s RED 959 in thier article. I sa=
w this in a=0Apreview on Entertainmaint Tonight the other day. I also saw=
 Jerry driving his=0ASilver Boxster and a Grey/Black 993 (not sure if it =
was a Turbo) but it had=0ALightronic headlights! 

I also have a Porsche promotional tape that has Jerry talking about his P=
-=0Acars. It shows him a wharehouse (a very clean one at that!) with vari=
os=0APorsche=92s:  a red 356, green early 911 RS?, a white 911 S? a 964 o=
f some sort,=0Aand a white =9179 VW Beetle cabrio, lots of other cars too=
 in the couple secs of=0Atape....


>According to today's "Die Welt" (German newspaper, see 
>http://www.welt.de/980409/0409wi14.htm), Jerry Seinfeld got the very 
>final air-cooled 911, which came off the line at the end of March.

I wonder if Jerry is indeed buying the last 993 (silver?) if the story is=
 true=0Athat this car rolled off the assembly line the same day Ferry pas=
sed away?=0Aanyone know for sure?

The above plot does indeed have merit to it! Maybe Jerry=92s new advertis=
ing=0Aagency will be handling Porsche=92s US advertising and that is why =
Freb Schwab=0Ais on the show?
