I have had my share of 1st this last year.

First 911,  I have replaced the brake pads, then found the flexible
break lines were shot so replaced them with Stainless lines, and now the
break pedal doesn't return all the way so the breaks are still on.  So I
order the bronze bushings from automotion and a master cylinder rebuild
kit.  I carefully pull out the entire Pedal box and master cylinder.  I
sent it off to be hot tanked and glass beaded.  I started the rebuild on
the master cylinder only to find the do not include all the parts.
$49.00 plus shipping for a useless kit.  After several calls I was
informed that all the parts are not available so a complete rebuild kit
does not exist.  SO I call Porsche and find they do not have a rebuild
kit but they will sell me a new master cylinder for $101 after my PCA
discount.  Porsche is getting very competitive in pricing and gives a
two year warranty on the parts too.

My problem now is I have the master cylinder installed and am trying to
install the clutch return spring.  I cannot find a picture of how it is
to be placed anywhere does anyone know how to install this spring?  It
is a  coiled spring on one end with a long straight piece that ends in a
hook on the other.  I believe it goes under the clutch pedal shaft but
it doesn't look correct.  Any hints.
