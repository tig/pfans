There is a new event at the Glen for PCA Club racers where they will be able to race both in sprints and enduros.



Porsche/Watkins Glen Double Fifty Celebration

Hosted by Brian Redman, August 27, 28, 29 and 30th.



The weekend will be a unique celebration of Porsche's 50th birthday and the 50th anniversary of the rebirth of American road racing at Watkins Glen.



The two Golden Anniversaries will be celebrated in an unforgettable weekend of racing, a Concours d'Elegance, and a downtown tour.



Amongst the legendary Porsche drivers attending are George Follmer, Dickie Attwood, Hurley Haywood, Vic Elford, Joe Buzzetta and Brian Redman.



Fittingly the Porsche museum in Stuttgart is sending the first 356 built along with an RS60, Sebring winner in 1960 and a Gmund Coupe, the first Porsche to win at Le Mans (750-1100cc class). Also from Stuttgart will be a Le Mans winning Rothmans 956, the "Moby Dick" long tail 935, a 917K in the 1970 Le Mans winning colors of Porsche Austria (then driven by Richard Attwood/Hans Herrmann) and a 1971 Gulf 908/3. 



Four cars are coming from the Collier museum in Naples, Florida, including the Spa winning 908/01 Langheck coupe and an RS 61 eight cylinder. The dominating 917 series will be well represented by three John Wyer/Gulf 917K coupes, the Brumos 917/10 for Hurley Haywood, Mike Amalfitano's beautiful Interserie car and Dave Morse's legendary 1100 horsepower Penske/Sunoco/Donohue Can-Am championship winning 917/30. A Le Mans winning Rothmans 962 and 956 head the list of over a dozen of these superb long distance machines. Other racing Porsches will be well represented by examples of the 936, 935, 934, 924GTR, 910, 907, 906, 904, 550, RSK and more.



We invite all Porsche racing cars to compete in this extraordinary event. PCA Club racers-for the first time-will be able to compete at one of North America's finest circuits along with the many vintage racers in both sprint and 1 hour endurance races.
