Hi Juha,

Great idea about the European Club schedule on the web. Do think a separate
site would be best or incorporate it into Porsche Net Europe for example? I
would love to visit overseas club meets and would welcome visitors at our
own.

With regards to general club twinning I envisioned each magazine producer
sending copies of their respective magazines to one another. An arrangement
were we could use each others articles. Maybe a dedicated page in said
magazines with say the odd overseas running report to make it more personal.
Assisting each another to find the best sources of say club regalia and
spares in one anothers countries. Another benefit which is fairly obvious is
that we also each then have a vast pool of experience and talent to fish
into for advice etc.

Cheers

Stephen

Good idea, perhaps not so easy to implement.
I'm secretary for Porsche Club Finland and are open for all suggestions.

What we at least could do is to have an European Porsche activities
schedule from where could be seen what is going on and where.
This way if somebody is travelling he/she could contact local people
and possible participate.
