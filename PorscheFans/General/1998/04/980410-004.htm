  Based on another story I've heard, this may be incorrect.  When production
  of the 928 was scheduled to cease in '95, supposedly a prospective 928
  buyer went into a Florida dealership (Champion?) and ordered an outrageously
  outfitted 928 GTS complete with Perlglanz green paint (kind of yellow/lime
  green) and Plum leather.  The customer placed the order on the condition 
  that the car be the very last 928 ever produced.  Porsche went through
  great expense to create the car to the customer's specifications (including
  fines levied on the company for using paint containing a component that
  was banned in Germany) and finally delivered the car to the States.  When
  the customer went to pick up the car, he learned that it wasn't actually
  the last 928, but rather the second to the last 928.  Supposedly, the
  Porsche factory has a policy that states the last production car of any
  model is to be put in the Porsche museum when production of the model ends.
  
  Apparently, that Perlglanz green 928 sat in the dealer's showroom for a
  long time after the customer refused to take delivery!
