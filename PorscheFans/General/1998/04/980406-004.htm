RE: I will be going to Monterey (from Seattle) in August.  I am a long time (18
years and 6 cars) Porsche owner, but not a club member.  Can anyone advise of
any interesting Porsche events on Friday?  

There will be a number of things on Friday.  
1.  Practice for all vintage race groups at the track.  Some people think
this is the best day because it isn't to crowded and you get to see all of
the cars run.  My favorite day

2.  Usually MBR PCA does something for a get together BBQ the like.

3.  There will be a auction at the Doubletree.  If you are a car buff its
worth going.

4. If you know somebody who is racing, there is a steak BBQ at the track for
entrants and crew.  Tickets in advance.

5.  The biggest event going is the Italian Concour at Quail Lodge in Carmel
Valley.  There will be at least a 1000 cars there either on display or in
the parking lot.  There are car corrals for the non Italian marks and the
show is a very good one.

There will be tons of stuff to do.

As for the coral and parade lap, check with PCA.  They run the coral and the
display of cars in the turn 2-6 parking area.  That is where the parade laps
will come from.  Even if you aren't "clubby" accomodations are usually made
if you drive a Porsche.

Good luck,
