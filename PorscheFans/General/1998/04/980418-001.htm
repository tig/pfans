=46or anybody going to Peeble Beach this year, I think the factory cars
that were at Amelia Island this weekend are supposed to be there.  You
guys are in for a treat.  I was able to see with my own eyes cars that
I had only seen pictures of or heard about in magazines and books.
There were also some of best examples of the Porsche marquee that I
have ever seen.  Any PorscheFans that were at Amelia Island this
weekend I'm sure will back me up on this.  I've never been to Peeble
Beach or a Parade, so I can't compare this with either of those
events.  I came away in awe of the beautiful cars.
