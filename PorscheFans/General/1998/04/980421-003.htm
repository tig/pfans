Hello P-fans,

God (and grandparents) willing, my wife and I will ditch our little =
darling girls (of ages 2 and 3) for a week and a half of holidays this =
summer.  We have been hoping to travel in the UK for a few years, but =
for some (read: no speedlimits) reason we keep heading through Germany =
every time.  This time we thought we'd go for the drive in the UK.  The =
question we are now facing is whether to go by ferry/road/ferry with =
either the Carrera or the quattro, or take the easy way out and fly and =
rent wheels.  Herein lies the problem...

I will not ruin my bi-annual holiday of two weeks by having to drive =
some econobox, so what may my options be?  I know performance cars are =
rented in the UK, but at what cost?  I'll slip my Nomex on for the next =
idea - I thought it be kind of fun to rent a Lotus Elise for a trip like =
this (and travel light), as I most certainly could never be convinced to =
buy one.

How much of a hassle is driving with LHD in the UK?  Both cars are =
begging for at least one good outing this summer, this may be my only =
chance.  The other limitation to the drive/sail/drive is time, as we'd =
be spending the first and last two days of our trip in transit.

Sorry for the wasted BW, maybe some of our UK residents can give me =
pointers - or refer me to a super cheap place to rent a 993 Cabrio for =
two weeks ;^)
