Concerning all of the LoJack/Car Theft Discussions...

I am planning on living close to NYC in a few months, and I have reserched a
number of antitheft alternatives.

Supposedly, the toughest thing for thieves to get around is a fuel kill
switch. This can be in two forms...a racing type switch or a simple flip
switch. The flip switch is installed somewhere in the car, you simply flip it
over when you leave, and there is no way to start the car (unless they find
the switch!!).  The racing type switch is located externally...it works in a
similar fashion except that there is a removable key.

I think that a good alarm system with ignition kill...and the fuel kill switch
will stop  95% of car thieves (they would have to tow it away). For the other
5%...there is probably nothing that can be done.

Also...please note that I have heard of Air-bag problems developing from
installing aftermarket alarms on top of the Porsche alarm. Specifically, I
have heard that the airbags can deploy during heavy braking. As you all
probably know..this is an expensive repair (two bags...and a windshield).
