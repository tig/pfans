>Hi All,
>	Sorry it's taken a while, but as promised, here is a list of kits that I
>have compiled.  If anyone has any further comments or reviews to add, please
>let me know, and I will include them in the latest version.
>
>Model List
>
>Revision Date 2/2/98.
>
>As a bit of a model kit nut, having built over 30 1/24 Porsche cars alone
>(not including the other 30 assorted kits, and the 30 I have yet to start !),
>I feel that I can offer some advice on plastic kits, from a European
>availability perspective.
>
>356
>There are quite a few kits of 356's in various guises.  The main manufacturer
>being Fujimi of Japan.  I have two of these kits, and though now the majority
>are out of production, they are well worth getting hold of, given the chance.
> All Fujimi kits of the 356 are Enthusiast Models, which allow you to build
>two or three different versions of the same basic car.  For example, the 2000
>Carrera GS Cabriolet, my first 356 kit, enables you build the B or C
>versions, with both types of dashboard, headlights, wheels and other details
>provided (even down to the dash mounted handbrake).  The engine alone
>comprises of some 35 parts, so you can get an idea for the amount of detail
>included.
>
>911
>There are probably more 1/24 scale 911 kits produced than of any other car.
>The main problem is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get hold of
>most of  them.  The main manufacturers are Fujimi, Tamiya, Italeri and
>Revell.
>
>Lets start with Fujimi:
>The majority of  earlier 911 kits are of the Enthusiast Model type, with upto
>200 parts per kit, including 30-40 engine parts alone.  Talking from personal
>experience the earliest 911 kit I have built, so far, is the 1969 911S.  In
>my opinion, this is a superb kit, and gives excellent results, with
>everything down to the engine distributor being correct and in detail.  In
>common with other kits of this type, the engine can be displayed seperately,
>on it's own labeled stand.
>
>Some popular versions (e.g. 911 Turbo) have been produced in both Enthusiast
>and Real Sports Car type kits (the latter of which having less detail, and
>are consequently easier to build).  These include most of the Carrera 2/4
>derivatives, including 3.8RS, and the Turbo 2.  Again, though a simple kit,
>the results look good.
>
>Later 911 variants (993 Turbo, Carrera and Cabriolet) are currently available
>from Revell  and Italeri (I suspect that these are a joint venture, as the
>mouldings are identical, and the only difference is the colour of the
>plastic).  The unfortunate problem with these kits is the interior is that of
>the earlier impact bumper cars, so not really correct, but the door pannels
>and seats are easily modified.  To date there is no glass roof targa (I have
>corrected this oversight by converting a Carrera Coupe).
>
>914/6
>Revell produced a 914/6 kit in 1/25, but I have only seen this one for sale
>once, where I purchased it, this is a very rare kit.  This is a kerbside kit
>with a little engine detail.
>
>924
>The only 924 kit I have seen was a 1/18 1981 924 Turbo at a model show last
>year, it appeared to be motorised and have working lights !  If anyone has
>any further details, or knows the whereabouts of such a kit, I may be
>interested.
>
>928
>There are a number of 928 kits available, from ESCI, Fujimi, Airfix and
>Tamiya.  My favourite is  the now discontinued 1981 Tamiya 1/20 928S kit, as
>the engine detail is superb and the size is large enough to paint the Pasha
>trim pattern on the seats and kick panels.
>
>944
>Revell Germany produced a nice 1/24 kerbside 944S in left hand drive (There
>is a little engine detail, but it is a turbo engine, not the 16 Valve), this
>is readily converted into a 944 NA, but this has been discontinued for a
>while now, so if you see one, grab it ! 
>
>A better bet is the Italeri 1/24 944S, which is practically the same kit,
>again if you can get your hands on one, as this one has probably gone out of
>production too, but more recently.  The conversion should involve no more
>than extending the bumpers, and adding the larger front overriders and
>altering the wheels (teledials).  If you have cookie cutters, this complcates
>matters, as you have to alter the teledials to suit.  The auxillary indicator
>lights could be painted on for simplicity (I use a couple of coats of Humbrol
>Clear Orange painted over well dried Chrome Silver 191 for lights).  A
>sunroof can also be cut into the body, by taking measurements from the full
>size car.
>
>The Italeri 944 Cabriolet, is actually closer to the Cabriolet 'Studie'
>prototype, basically a 16V Cabrio, with the Turbo front end, with fuchs
>alloys.  This car was produced by Bauer, before the American Sunroof
>Corporation got the contract to build the production version.  To accurately
>complete the S2 Cabrio, add a set of  Fujimi 911 Carrera 2 Targa alloys (7
>spoke).
>
>Unfortunately, Fujimi never produced a 944 kit, but they have done a few
>928's and a large number of 911 variants (see 911 section, above).
>
>944 Turbo (951)
>Italeri, Hasegawa and Revell all produce, or have produced good kits of 944
>turbo's (951's) both road and Blaupunct Turbo Cup versions.  My favourite are
>the Hasegawa's, as these kits include fine engine detail, carpets (!),
>lifting bonnet (hood) and operating pop-up headlamps..
>
>968 
>Hasegawa produce excellent 968 and 968 Club Sport kits, these do have full
>engine detail, that can be added to if you feel that way inclined (so called
>'Superdetailing').
>
>
>
>Boxter
>The new Tamiya kit, which I have just completed, includes parts to build the
>open top, soft top and hard top versions.  A basic kit, but very high
>quality, and it looks great.
>
>
>Endurance Racing Prototypes
>
>Also available are the 911 GT2 racing variants (Taisan StarCard and Sogo
>Keibi) from Tamiya, and along with the excellent 911 GT1 kit.  Alternative
>decals are available seperately for both of these kits, so you can build the
>two factory cars from 1996, and the Marlboro GT1 from the 1997 Le Mans 24 Hr,
>and eight different GT2's.
>
>Other Racing Types
>
>There is a 356 Spyder version from Matchbox in 1/25, called the 'Porsche
>Speedster Racer' from the mid '50's, but this is a very basic kit.
>
>
>P.S. If any of you do build kits, and have any spare parts, keep them in a
>safe place, as these bits can be useful in converting other kits, space
>wheels, dashboards, etc.
>
>Hope someone out there can find this useful, if anyone has any more
>information on any kits I may have missed, please let me know, and I will
>revise this list.
>If you have any questions in relation to kit conversions, I would only be too
>glad to offer any advice.
>
