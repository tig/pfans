Donna, in reply to your question regarding VIN codes, the best advice I can
give is to pick up "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook" by (yeah you guessed it)
Bruce Anderson.  I loked for my first 911 for about a year, and was losing my
mind talking to folks about thier 911 for sale and what it supposedly was,
only to travel and find out they were wrong (I'm from Illinois, bought my
turbo from San Diego!) The book explains VIN's in detail. By the way people,
please stop calling them VIN numbers. You're repeating yourself, (Vehicle
Identification Number Numbers?). Bruce is truly a wealth of information. I
have used his code cracking system on numerous occassions for several friends
and  associates who were also searching, and have been right on the money
every time. heres a quick run down on 1981 and later.
First 3 letters (WPO) are the world producer code
Next 2 letters and first number are the VDS code
        first letter of these three indicates body series
         A-coupe
         E-targa,cab, or speedster
