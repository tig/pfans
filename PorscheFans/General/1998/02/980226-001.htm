Hi, all,

In response to Juha Vane yesterday, I wrote:

I happened to mention this in passing yesterday to my wife, who is a
horse person (no, dammit, I mean she RIDES horses ;^)

Lexol and neatsfoot oil have been staple supplies for maintaining leather
saddles, etc, which live in a fairly harsh environment.

She tells me that neatsfoot oil is not used by her circle of friends anymore,
the reasons being that it:

1 - leaves a greasy residue that WILL get on your clothes, and
2 - over time, though it keeps leather in good condition, it will
    promote rot in the stitching on saddles (and presumably car seats too!)

I personally use the Lexol cleaner and the leather conditioner, and it
works great.

Anyone wondering where to get stuff like this, incidentally, needs to look
only as far as the nearest horse tack shop. These places are always full
of leather care products.

Cheers!

Ross
