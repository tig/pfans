	Oh I understood the workings of LoJack pretty well.  What I was
concerned with was the idea that the car is stripped too quickly for the
utility of LoJack to be realized.  If the cars really are stripped in a
couple of hours, then LoJack is pretty much worthless if it's going to
take the police longer to get their act together and look for the car.  I
live in New York City and I worry that the police won't respond to the
call quickly enough for the system to be effective.  I'm curious to see
whether other people share this view, or if the view expressed by that web
page is unrealistic.
