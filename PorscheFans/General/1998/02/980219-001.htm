Hey there p-nuts,

My good friend is reluctantly selling his beloved 914.
He's a woodsculptor (and gearhead)  who needs to get back into a small
pickup.  He bought a good car to start with, and it got even better under
his care.  The car was a long-term project by the PO who put the newer
style bumpers (outer shells only) on it, replaced the entire interior, did
the major rebuilds (noted below) and painted it white.  Its not a concours
paint job by any stretch of the imagination (the PO actually called it
"temporary"), but it looks ok and this car is an EXCELLENT daily driver
candidate...It runs and drives real well and has about the tightest shift
pattern on any '14 I've ever driven...my '74 2.0 linkage is lumpy oatmeal
compared to his.
My friend performed the "next level" of maintenance; exhuast system, Turbo
tie rods, miscellaneous injection stuff, new windshield, and new tires...he
is asking $3500 for it.  He's a good listener, especially if you have a
decent truck to barter with.
If interested, Call or email me and  I'll provide a phone# for him.  PS; I
get absolutely nothing outa this deal...except maybe a cold one, if there
happens to be any in his fridge...This car needs to go to a GOOD HOME.
We are in Ridgecrest, CA - about 3.5hrs northeast of L.A.

cheers
