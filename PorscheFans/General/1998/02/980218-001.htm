Some time ago, I joined in on a Barrier bashing session. I was unhappy with
certain members of their sales staff and displeased with their service
because of several things that occurred, not the least of which was putting
non-synthetic oil in my 1997 Boxster at a routine oil change.

On Thanksgiving day of last year, I was putting up Christmas lights and in
order to get the ladder down from the ceiling of my garage, I started my
Boxster and pulled it out of the garage. Total running time was about 1
minute. Then, perhaps 15 minutes later, I pulled the car back in. Again,
total running time was about 1 minute. After getting the lights up, I
decided to pull the car back out so we could put the ladder back up on the
ceiling. 

Wrong!  At this point, my Boxster would not start. Then my son-in-law
decided to step on the accelerator (a definite no-no for injected engines).
That was it. When cranked, then engine spun like the heads were off. No
compression!  I had it trucked to Barrier for warranty service.  They told
me that I needed a whole new engine. At first I though they were nuts but
then discovered that Porsche had a technical bulletin requiring that engines
experiencing any internal failure were to be returned to the factory for
analysis.  So the wait began. The holiday season is NOT a good time to have
something as catastrophic as an engine failure occur. 

While waiting for the engine, I had occassion to discuss my various gripes
about Barrier with their General Manager, Michael Vena, their Service
Manager, and one of their Service Advisors, Gary Scheible.  They all were
very anxious to get everything resolved to my satisfaction. They truly went
out of their way to make sure I was a happy customer.  

I mentioned that I thought the shop had put some minor dings in the top of
my right front fender when they had installed my CD player. Of course, there
was no way I could prove they had done it, so I was resigned to getting it
repaired myself.  The General Manager immediately said that they would take
care of it. And take care of it they did.  Once I got the car back, they
sent an amazingly competent Dent Wizard to fix the problem. It took him
about half an hour to undo the damage and restore the fender to factory new
condition. No muss, no fuss, no paint, and no sanding. It was amazing and I
was very impressed. I'll be using the Dent Wizard for several other cars I
have.

In addition to that, I just noticed that they replaced the rear deck Boxster
script that I had managed to break while washing the car.

It took me two months to get my car back but I'm convinced that the delay
was at the Zuffenhausen end, not a local problem. Once the engine was in,
and back in my hands, the car has run flawlessly ever since. Of course, the
down side of that is that I have to break it in all over again. Oh well.

Anyway, since then, I've taken my Jaguar XJ12 there for warranty repair and
have been well-pleased with the repairs and their general attitude.  My
faith in the Barrier Motors service and parts departments has been restored.
I'll continue to take my cars there

My recommendation to those who may have a axe to grind with Barrier Motors,
talk to them. They're very accomodating. I think they really do want
satisfied customers and they're willing to go the extra mile to have them.
Oh, and I don't think I'll be having any further problems with regular motor
oil going in to my Boxster. It's Mobil 1 from here on out.
