There is only so much you can do really.  I have a very good VSE alarm
in my 944 Turbo with the factory alarm wired in with it for extra security,
I park my car at work in a well lit spot right near the escalator doors
(work in a building on top of a mall so car parks in the mall area) with
alarm blinkies doing their job and still some scum broke my window and
damaged the door frame for a C$199 CD player.

When talking to the security gaurd after the incident, he said I was
lucky that the horns and siren were fairly loud and probably prevented 
the thief from trying the ignition.  A Mustang 5.0L was stolen from this
mall even though it had two alarms, a pedal lock and a steering lock.
How did they take it?  By towing it!  Well, that's what they think 
anyways.

Also another note by the police when I was giving them my report, there
have been a rash of alarm thefts!  So, if you have a big dollar multi
thousand $$$ alarm in your car, don't advertise what brand it is on the
sticker because the theif may only want your alarm brain.

I live in a fairly decent city, crime wise, but have had over $10,000
stolen from me over the last two years, have had an intruder in my
bedroom at 3:30am and have had two unsuccesful attempts at getting into
my house and car, usually leaving behind broken glass or obvious theft
attempt marks.  Luckily, knock on wood, things have calmed down in the
neighbourhood.  The police feel that a group moves into your neighbourhood,
watch what patterns develop in the homes and then strike when the risk
is the least.  THey do this to the entire neighbourhood and then move
onto another area where they do the same.  When I met an intruder in
my house at 3:30am, my Porsche was parked in the garage and there was
visible life upstairs in the home, yet the thief managed to break a
deadbolt and get in and then had the nerve to enter my living quarters.
Quite a scarey experience, I still can't sleep facing away from the door :(

If they want it bad enough, they'll do anything to get it.
