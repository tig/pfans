This type of question has surfaced now and again so please excuse me if it's
way past the "oh no, not that again" stage....

I'm replacing my original Boge "sport" shocks in my '87 911 after 79k miles. 
I'm leaning to Bilsteins due to good reports on this list as being
teeth-filling-friendly but long-lived and great handling.  However, I have had
(from Bilstein, nonetheless!!!) inconsistent reports of whether I should go for
the HD or Sport shocks.  I'm hoping someone on the list here can provide some
real-life experience on this?

The car has a 100% stock suspension, and I have no plans to change that. 
However, it has been lowered a *bit* -- an inch, maybe 1.5", with fender lips
at 25" rear and 25.5" front (this year range car apparently came from the
factory *quite high*).  I do not detect obvious signs of bottoming but can't be
sure.

I use the car as the daily driver (city streets and a little freeway) so it
must be comfortable.  I do not mind the stiffness of the suspension as it is
today.  I believe I would find a *much* stiffer suspension too uncomfortable. 
I do a few DE and AX events a year; for fun, not for breaking records :-).

I posed this scenario to Bilstein twice recently.

Call #1 to Bilstein: they said "use the HD", noting that there was no height
difference between HD and Sport and so the suspension height will not force the
choice.

Call #2 to Bilstein (this morning, just paranoia checking): they said "you
should use the Sport" because the Sport is a shorter shock; at 1.5" lowering
the HD will run out of room.  Although I did get some interesting data on
damping factors for the two (the Sport and HD are nearly identical for
compression but the Sport is about 50% stiffer on rebound), the person I talked
to did not realize that my car doesn't have springs so I'm not sure whether he
looked up the right shock.  (I have a call in to the Tech Support people to
hopefully shed some more light on this.)
