	I just heard a commercial for LoJack, that car security system, on
the radio in New York today.  They were telling some story about a guy who
had his Porsche stolen even though he had the standard Porsche security
system.  I was horrified to hear them butcher the pronunciation of
Porsche.  I'd expect so much more from a company that deals with anything
automotive.  I felt obliged to drop them some email about it :)  But
regardless, has anyone had any experience with these?  I found this web
site about auto-security that suggested that any stolen car is either
wrecked or stripped for parts within hours after it is stolen so such
security devices are of little use if your car is stolen by experienced
thieves.  Of course, the dealership trying to sell me LoJack couldn't
disagree more.  I'm not sure who to believe, except that the website had
no vested interest in getting me to hold on to my money while the
dealership had interest in getting me to part with it.  Any opinions out
there?
