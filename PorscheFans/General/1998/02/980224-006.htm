When I went to my car audio dealer last (about 1.5 years ago) VSE looked
like it was going out of business.  The shop (the only one that had any
VSE units left) only had two units, both of which I bought.  I've had
Clifford, Alpine and DEI alarms in previous cars and hated all of them.
In my previous car, I installed the VSE Raptor, a very simple alarm with
very good, useful features.  Ever since then, I've become an avid 
supporter of these alarms.  They use some interesting configurations to
defeat thieves, like a normally open starting circuit.  Even if you disconnect
the alarm, the car will not start because the alarm has to close the
starting circuit before the car will start.  Most alarms use the other 
method of always have a normally closed circuit which the alarm then
keeps open while armed.  Disconnect the alarm and the car will fire up
right away.

Another nice part about the VSE alarm is the remote is very German like
in construction and tactile feel, very simplistic and functional.

The only mistake I think I made when getting my alarm installed was to
not use an external blinkie.  I'm using the factory door blinkies and
knowledgeable thieves think the car only has a factory alarm.  All
factory alarms I know of allow you to break the glass w/o any alarm going
off.  Only when a door, hood or trunk is opened do they go off.

If I see any units around, I'll let you know.
