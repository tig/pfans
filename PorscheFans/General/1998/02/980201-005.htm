   I've been winter storing cars for many years.  If you just let the
battery sit for the winter, you'll be lucky to get more than 2 - 3 years
life.  I'd suggest getting one of the small Schumacher automatic chargers
(about the size of your hand, and 1" thick) which sell for about $25.
Specifically designed for cars and boats.
   Rather than applying a constant trickle charge, they monitor the battery
voltage and only charge when the voltage drops below a preset level.  I've
got two of them, they work great.  The newer ones have an LED to indicate
full charge.

   By the way, everyone I've talked to has suggested you NOT start a winter
stored car, unless you drive it long enough to completely warm it up.
Better off just letting it sit (sigh) for the entire, never ending, bleak,
cold, dreary, winter.
