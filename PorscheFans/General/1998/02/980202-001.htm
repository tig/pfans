You need to ask the representative/salesman who claimed it wasn't
an additive...

My opinions:

1 - I don't care what is or isn't in it - if it doesn't come in the
    same bottle as your oil, then it's an oil additive.

2 - The lubricant/fuel companies spend a lot of time and money testing
    their products and developing an additive *package* which is always
    in their product.  How do the ingredients in Pro-Long react/interact
    with the oil and its original additive package?  Since each oil has
    a different additive package, has Pro-Long tested the interaction
    with each oil type?

3 - What perceived problem is Pro-Long supposed to solve?  Running a car
    on no oil is "neat", but how often do you run your car without oil?
