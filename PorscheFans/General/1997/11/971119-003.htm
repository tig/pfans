Subject: 	Porsche pre buy check

Rosaleen, 
	Sorry to hear or your dreadful experience with the 924: yours is a very sad 
tale! I had a friend years ago who had one, not sure of year ('80?), and that 
924 was trouble when only 3 or 4 years old. I hate to say it, but the 924 was 
not one of the best models Porsche has built. In some ways it is more VW than 
Porsche, as many parts actually interchange with VW's and/or Audi's. Yet even 
the VW's seem to be better cars....Sorry! 
	As to the pre-check, I have found this is a useful practice in general. That 
being said, auto dealers are used to servicing new and recent model cars. Most 
cars are not serviced at the dealer after the warranty period expires, as 
dealers often have expensive service rates. Dealers make a lot of profit, 
maybe most of their profit, from service. 
	I would recommend using an honest independent shop rather than the dealer, 
unless one has a new car under warranty. One can also have a personal 
relationship with a good independant mechanic, and I have found he will often 
do better work if he knows you and the car.  
	Seems that you have a lemon. Sell the car... But the dealer should certainly 
have noticed several of the things you mention, the most glaring being the bad 
compression in one cylinder. That is inexcusable, in my opinion. Also, brakes 
should have been easy to diagnose.... Seems that the dealer is incompetent, 
unscrupulous, or both....
	Porsches are not trouble free cars. But they are wonderful in many ways. I 
love my car, she is like a member of the family. I have had my '81 911 for 
almost 14 years now, and it has been an experience I would not want to have 
missed. However, my car nearly always starts up and drives off quite 
cheerfully.( If she heard me say that, the battery is likely going dead as I 
type this...).
	Better luck next time?  Best wishes, Warren.
