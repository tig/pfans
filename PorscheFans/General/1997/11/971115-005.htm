I admit that my experience with used cars is both limited and negative. 
But no mechanic can be expected to be clairvoyant, and there are all
sorts of things not related to the drivetrain that can disable a car.

Case in point:  I bought a car for my son to use, from my Porsche
mechanic, who has serviced my car for over 20 years, first at the
dealership, then as an independent.  It's an Audi 5000 turbo that
belonged to my guy's brother-in-law, that my mechanic "guaranteed" was a
good car, especially for the money.  The transmission oil is absolutely
clean, and after 145000 miles the engine neither burns nor leaks oil. 
But there have been other things--chasing a hydraulic leak that Audis
are known for, plus a radiator hose stub that literally broke off,
scalding my mechanic's forearm (a new radiator there), to say nothing of
binding power windows (a broken motor in one instance), climate control
system, etc.

And since the 924/44 series has more than a little in common with Audi,
I'm not venturing too far off topic.  Fact is, a used car is always a
used car, and you never know what's going to happen.  When you've owned
the car yourself, you always tend to be more generous:  there are things
you've grown used to (just like with people and houses), and you allow
that after a certain point there will be major repairs needed from time
to time.  A prepurchase inspection can evaluate performance and telltale
signs, but a complete teardown makes no economic sense--that's what you
do when something goes wrong.

The advantage of buying a car from a dealer is whatever warranty you get
with the car, plus the implied warranty of fitness for purpose that is
not expected of a private party.  The disadvantage is price--you're
paying top dollar in exchange for these protections.  With a private
party, unless you can prove out-and-out fraud, you've bought the car.

And I never forget, in my own life, that seven years ago I passed an
insurance physical (with resting EKG) with flying colors, only to have a
heart attack a month later!

It's the nature of the beast.  That's why I've always bought new, if I
could afford to.
