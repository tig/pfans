Hi All,

For years I've covetted a Porsche and maybe I'll finally get one in '98.
Finances beeing what they are, I'm looking at used porsches only. I'm 
interested in both the 911 of 1980's Carrera vintage and the 944 Turbo or S2
(the latter fit my budget a little more comfortably). Maybe even a 968 if
the price were right.

Anyhow, I've never actually driven a Porsche and the time has come to go
and test drive a few to see what I really like. I need to narrow down my
interests before I do some serious looking. Since I have no intention
of buying for a several months at least, I don't really want to annoy a 
private individual trying to sell his/her car with useless test drives.

So I'd like to find a car dealer with a decent (ie they have some) used 
porsche selection in the Washington DC Area so that I can test drive the
cars listed above. Living in N. Va, I've tried HBL and Heischmans (sp?), but 
they had no used porsches to speak of, at least not the ones I'm interested in.

Any recommendations?

TIA,

-Eric
