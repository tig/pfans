    Joseph:

    If it really is flooding (hard to believe with a Motronic
    fuel-injection system, but I guess it could happen), it fails to
    start because you've pumped gasoline into a cold engine.

    Since the intake manifold and combustion chamber are cold, the
    gasoline just condenses on the metal... Liquid gasoline doesn't
    burn nearly as well as gasoline vapor; worse, it can coat your
    spark plugs and keep them from firing.

    The "wait of 15 to 30 minutes" is necessary for the liquid
    gasoline to evaporate.

    Yes:

    Press the pedal all the way to the floor and HOLD IT THERE... By
    doing so, you'll make it easier for the liquid gasoline to
    evaporate.

    Wait a few seconds, then crank the engine again WHILE CONTINUING
    TO HOLD THE PEDAL DOWN... It'll eventually start, at which point
    you should release the pedal.
