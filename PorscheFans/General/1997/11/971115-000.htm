Sorry to hear of your misadventure.  It is just as easy -- perhaps easier --
to find an incompetent mechanic than it is to find a beat up Porsche
"headache-in-waiting."  You'll find them at both authorized dealers and
independent specialists.

There is almost no way a full pre-purchase check by a competent mechanic
would miss the impending-in-500-mile "cylinder head replaning, new valve
guides and one valve replacement" you mention.  A compression check,
leak-down test, examination of the spark plugs (all of which should be
included in a 100 Pound -- $170US? -- pre-purchase check) and, perhaps, a
sniff of the tailpipe with an exhaust gas analyser, would quickly reveal
impending doom (I am assuming, of course, that in your first 500  miles you
checked and did not run out of oil, water, etc.!)

You say you have needed a complete new rear brake system.  Even a forecourt
tire changer would be able to see if your rear brake pads or rotors were
within 500 miles of necessary replacement.  No "regular 12,000 mile service"
in the world requires new brake rotors or pads!  The subsequent "soft brakes"
you note are a clear indication of gross incompetence &/or fraud in the rear
brake repairs.

In the USA, what you describe -- assuming you've left nothing out -- would
represent actionable fraud, both in the pre-purchase inspection and in
subsequent work.  No authorized Porsche dealer would allow such incompetence;
sales here now are too good for Porsche, or its franchisees, to risk.

Now, no Porsche is going to run with the delightful boredom of your Toyota
diesel.  Weird electrial gremlins that occasionally fix themselves are part
of the territory, especially in a damp climate like Britain's.  It's not so
much that you bought a bum 924 but that you bought a bum mechanic.
 Fortunately, the mechanic has a boss  ~:^-)  Go for the jugular, Roz-grl!
