Thanks to all who gave me so much useful advice on my first DE.  It was
just as terrific as you said it would be.  Road Atlanta is a pretty amazing
course, and the 911 is a pretty amazing car.

I can't praise the Peachstate Region's organization and running of this
event enough.  Everything went off with military precision, so as many
people got as much track time as possible, with a very strong emphasis on
safety.  Well done, Peachstate!

I went in with three goals, and accomplished all three:  I learned a lot, I
kept it shiny side up and front end forward, and I had a tremendous amount
of fun.  There were a lot of high points, but definitely one of the most,
uh, exciting, was on the second run of the first afternoon when I came over
the rise in turn 11 and there was somebody doing 360's right in front of
me... yikes!

Can't wait for the next one.
