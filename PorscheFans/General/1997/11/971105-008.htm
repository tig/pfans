My roomate and I are a couple of Porsche nuts.  We are currently =
building=20
a doorbell system from scratch as a fun project for our dorm room.  We=20
thought it would be a really cool idea to have the sound be the=20
distinctive sound of the Porsche horn.  If you know anyone who has an =
extra horn, or can tell us where to find one please email me.  We also =
would like some information on the horn itself such as the voltage, etc. =
=20

I've heard that there are actually two horns (at different frequencies)=20
that make up the horn system.  Some info on this would be appreciated=20
too.

Thanks in advance.
