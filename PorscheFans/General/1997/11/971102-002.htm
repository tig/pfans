'Fans,

Below is a series of posts I have made to the Porsche Pete Boxster
board, BUT I want to get other Porsche owner's comments on the smoke
that I am experiencing on start up.

_____________


Does anyone experience smoke when starting their Boxster after it has
sat for a while after being run a few minutes, e.g. Pulling it out of
the garage, leaving outside in the driveway for a few hours and then
starting it?

I get blue smoke every time this scenario is repeated. The smoke is
expelled for 5-10 second then no more. The dash oil level indicator has
dropped to two levels above the "LOW" mark. I checked it manually and it
reads above the low mark on the stick. By the way, BE careful with the
drip stick, it is LONG and thin and easily bent, like I ALMOST did,
putting it back!

I have 5600 miles on him, in 5 months. I have video taped the smoke and
will be calling the dealer to discuss this. I wish I had a snappy to
DIGITIZE the video!

ALL input and discussion APPRECIATED!!

An update.

I watched the tail tipe on start up after My Boxster had sat for 5
hours. There was a significant amount of Blue smoke, which continues at
idle then Large amounts again with three "rev'ings". The smoke was thick
enoungh that I could not read the licence plate for the smoke!

I have heard this before, and understand "Why" a flat six will smoke,
BUT when is IT TOO MUCH smoke to be normal?  That is the question I need
answered.

The reason this has come up is I not that the oil level was "LOW",
actually below the "LOWEST" line and the disaplayed FLASHED, after
filling up.  I have 5500 miles on the car, should I be adding oil this
soon?  The blue smoke is clearly from the burning of oil!  I have video
taped the car twice and will show it to the dealer and ever given them a
copy to send to PCNA and PC Ag. (I used one of the 911 "brochure" videos
and copied the scene of the start up from my video camera)

I would like to hear what other Boxster/911 owners have to say and their
experiences!
