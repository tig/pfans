    ATLANTA, Nov. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Deloitte & Touche/Fantus Consulting
conducted the search for a new corporate headquarters for Porsche Cars North
America, Inc. (PCNA), Bob Farley, director of the Atlanta office of
D&T/Fantus, said today.
          Georgia Governor Zell Miller and PCNA President and CEO Frederick J.
Schwab formally announced the automobile importer's plans to relocate its
administrative headquarters from Reno, Nev. to metro Atlanta's North Fulton
County at a news conference this morning.
          Farley said New York, Chicago and Dallas were the other contenders
for the
headquarters location.
          He cited five key reasons for the metro Atlanta's win:
          -- Atlanta's location offers better access to the parent company in
       Stuttgart, Germany, which in turn allows for better company
       integration.
          -- The move places Porsche in "the new center of the U.S. auto
industry."
          -- Metro Atlanta offers good recruiting potential, which is
important to a
       growing company; an excellent business climate that is international in
       scope; and a superior quality of life.
          -- The Southeastern U.S. location offers potential for expansion,
with the
       added possibility of providing North American manufacturing capability
       for Porsche at some future date.
          -- Georgia is very responsive and supportive to the needs of
business.
          D&T/Fantus was retained in August 1997 by Porsche to conduct the
search
for a new corporate headquarters.  Final location recommendations were made to
Porsche in October 1997.
          Approximately 30 percent of Porsche's employees in Reno are expected
to
move to Atlanta.  Annual payroll for Porsche in metro Atlanta will be in the
range of $8 million, with an economic ripple effect of up to $30 million.
          Porsche expects to employ more than 90 at its Atlanta location when
it
begins operating from its new 32,000-sq.-ft.-headquarters site in early March
1998.  The new headquarters site is slated to be in Lakeside Commons (the
Georgia 400 - I-285 area off of Hammond Road).
          Note:  D&T/Fantus has four locations in the U.S.:  Atlanta, Chicago,
Los
Angeles and the New York metro area.  The Atlanta office opened in June 1997.
Since 1919, the firm has conducted more than 9,000 site location projects.
