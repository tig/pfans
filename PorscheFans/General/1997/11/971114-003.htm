Larry,

I hate to ask, but did you follow the "oil check" procedures in your
owner's manual to the letter? 911s are different from most cars in
having dry sump oiling systems and among other things, this leads to
different procedures for checking the oil.

That having been said, a new car of any variety will almost always use
more oil than normal at first as things bed in - after a couple of
thousand miles, oil consumption should slow down.

Cheers,

Ross
