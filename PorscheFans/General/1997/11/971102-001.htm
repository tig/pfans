I seem to remember that porsche does use wire connectors, Yes?
With this in mind one can purchase an electronics tool that is in one
version a strong thin hollow "straw", this is inserted over the pins in 
the plastic retainer housing releasing a small metal "ear" thus allowing
the wire and pin to slide out of the housing. Of course mark the location
 if colors change from one side of the harness to the other. I have never
 found it neccesary to cut wires, maybe an aftermkt stereo install, but
 not factory harnesses,Mon dieu :>)

In the field I have been succesful in tightening the large allen via a 
large screwdriver without total dissasemble of harness. Other worries
are the prying of the glass can result in A:bkn glass, B:bkn retainer pins.
And while you are at it buy the little plug for the allen that holds the mirror
 base on, that way it does not fill with water and rust. Also for those w/out
a pass. mirror, one can add it via the fact manuals with a template location.
Also you will need a new harness( bitch to get in across the heater ducts)
And the rocker switch to change power left to right. The power direction
control switch on the door panel may still have a decal with color code
position still on it, look for it if you completly dismantle.. :>)

Three paint jobs? Sounds like way to much product on top of each
other. From what I know in the auto body biz, I will paint atop factory
paint,thats it. After that strip it.  It comes down to dissimilar materials
and different rates of expansion and contraction via thermal changes,
resulting in cracks, poor adhesion relying on previous paintwork and 
bodywork. Time equals money, craftsmen cost money, porsches cost
money, cut any corners and you will suffer the consequences. :>)
Pardon my bad french and/ or poor humor I am reassmbling a Deux

Remember if they ran perfectly one might not know how it works. This 
way we get to explore, just like they do on the operating table!
