A few months ago I went through the exact same thing.  Dunlop
recommended the SP4000's as a more versatile tire and said it would
handle better in the rain.  I've been told the D40M2's were
discontinued, but they have lots of them left (this could all be a
rumor).  Anyway, on the advice of my mechanic I went with the D40M2's
and have been very pleased.  Previously I had Pirelli PZero's, which are
amazing tires, but way too expensive.  The D40M2's compare well and hold
a turn much better than other tires I have ran.  Hopefully this helps.
Supposedly the SP4000 are better in bad weather, but I don't have to
worry much about that.

good luck
