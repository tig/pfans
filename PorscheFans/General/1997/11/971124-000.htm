Hi Keith
Came in late on the request for info on Minilite wheels, the address you
were given here in the UK is incorrect. The company Midland Wheel
Supplies at Napton Warwickshire does NOT supply genuine Minilite wheels
only replicas.

For info there are a number of replica's that have been produced here
over the years. The genuine wheels were originally sold by a company
called Tech Del under the name Minilite and were made of magnesium. This
gave them a very light weight and were ideal for racing.

The company however went through bad times and the company and its trade
name`Minilite have been bought and sold a number of times over the
years. The problem seems to have been in finding a large enough market
for what have been quite expensive wheels. Add to this the manufacturing
problems of turning magnesium and the great care needed by the owner in
looking after them, then you can understand their difficulty.

However, I was speaking to the owner about two years ago and they have
now been making the wheels in either magnesium or aluminium depending on
the buyers ability to pay. Surprise surprise most of the magnesium
supply was going to Japan.

I digress, if you want to contact the company that has the licence for
the real Minilites they can be found at,
Minilite Wheels Ltd, Unit 2, Eversley Way, Thorpe Industrial Estate,
Egham, Surrey. TW20 8RG England.
Tel: +44 (0)1784 433446		Fax: +44 (0)1784 439547

Even this is a different address to where I located them two years ago.
Let me know how you get on, and if you need more help.

By the way, the easy way ro know if the advertiser is selling a replica
is the way they spell Minilite (the copies are shown as Minilight)
