Well I'm certainly no expert, but I did just go through this process myself
in buying a 911, including having one car looked at both by my independent
mechanic and by the local Porsche dealer.  On the basis of that experience,
it is my purely subjective opinion that an independent mechanic
specializing in P-cars is likely to do a better job of a pre-purchase
inspection than is a dealer, purely because the independent sees more of
the older cars than do the wrenches at the dealer.
