Larry,
My two cents is that your 993 came with the Mobil One oil and this stuff
is very, very slippery. Some owners often report very high oil
consumption...some until 15,000-16,000 thousand miles because the rings
aren't seating as they would with "regular" oil.  

I have an 84 carrera with 112,000 miles and my (knock wood) oil
consumption is very small.  But yes, in general 911's use more oil than
most vehicles.
