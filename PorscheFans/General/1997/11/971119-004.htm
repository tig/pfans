From Panorama, March 1985:

	Porsche traces the history of the 944 Turbo back to 1981 at LeMans
where, disguised as a 924GTP, an experimental racing version of the car
finished a credible seventh overall and won a prize for reliability
based on having spent the least time in the pits.  Last June, a
pre-production version 944 Turbo fitted with a standard catalytic
converter won the 24 Hours of Nelson Ledges with a 40 lap advantage. 
The car was so quiet that the drivers kept themselves alert through the
long hours by listening to the radio.
	The catalytic converter concept was part of Porsche's basic plan from
the beginning. (and the article continues)

This leads me to think that whoever says that you should punch out the
cat either has a faulty cat or a faulty set-up going somewhere along
the  line.  Is it possible that chipping the car is causing an over-rich
condition and too much unburned fuel is reaching the converter?  Are
people disconnecting the O2 sensor for increased throttle response?  If
it worked for the factory in '84 then the  current drivers must be
changing something.  The original concept worked. 
I love these cars!  How many 'Vettes have run at LeMans? 
BTW, does anyone out there know whether the 86 944 Turbo came with
Pirelli P7 tires or what?  Just a bit of trivia I'm interested in. 
Also, would anyone have info on what the competition at Nelson Ledges
was in 1984?  Was Ferrari, Chevrolet, or who running against the
Porsches? Were there other Porsche cars entered?  I know nothing about
the track.
Last (I promise).. Does anyone run Yokohama A509s?  The price seems
reasonable but you can't get them thru Tire Rack...

Later!
