Hi all,
     I just purchased a '93 968 Tiptronic with 27k mi. and the brakes are
very sensitive (grabs) at the very end of a stop.  My mechanic is telling me
that I need to get new rotors in the front as well as new pads if I would
like to get rid of the problem (glazing sp?).  It's about $400 for the front
and I wondered if replacement is is the best solution, or if there are other
solutions which might be less expensive.  Also, it seemed odd to me that new
rotors were required after only 27k mi, even if the car is 3.5 years old.
     Also, I was thinking of upgrading from 16" to 17" wheels and wanted some
suggestions from fellow porsche owners.  I'm trying to decide between the 993
17" porsche originals vs. some 17" twisted style (like the 911 twin turbo's)
imitations.  The difference is that the 993's are 7" up front, and I've been
told I should have at least a 7.5" - as on the imitations - on front engine
porsches.  
     Lastly, I've been looking at wheels from Ernie's in Florida and Robert
Wood in Los Angeles, and wondered if anyone had used either of them.  This is
my first post, and I look forward to seeing the responses.
