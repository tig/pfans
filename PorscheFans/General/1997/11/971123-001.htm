Hi Porsche Fans,

I travel to Germany a couple of times a year on business and have been since 
1990.  However I have never taken the time to go to the Porsche factory, that 
is until last week. PCNA will make a reservation so you can take the factory 
tour. I won't bore the list with all of the gee whiz's that amazed me but just 
let me say that if you're near Stuttgart (about 2 hours by train from either 
Munich or Frankfurt),  make the time to visit the factory.  The most amazing 
things to me were; the amount of hand work, the slow speed of the line (only 
140ish cars per day),  all cars built on the same line without any disruption 
of the speed, they are still building 993's (turbos, targas, coupes, and cabs, 
the sophistication of the assembly line handling equipment sometimes in 
contrast to the tools being used on the line.  If you guys or gals have any 
questions about the factory, transportation, hotels, I'll do my best to 
answer.
