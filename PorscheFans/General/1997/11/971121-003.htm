If it were my car and I lived in an area where it did not snow I'd go =
with
the SP8000.  This tire is a much, much better tire than the D40M2.  A set
runs about $650.  I've had both and the difference was dramatic.  I have
not used the 4000 and I'm sure it is good as an all-season tire, but I'd
never put them on my 951 as the dry and even wet handling would suffer =
too
much.  The SP8000 is excellent in the rain.

Dunlop may be correct in their recommendation of the SP4000 over the
D40M2.  I really hated the D40s as they had a nasty tendency to follow
ruts in the road.  Others have not had this problem so it may be =
alignment
or car related.
