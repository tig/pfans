	I had a set of 4000s on my VW Corrado.  They're pretty good tires.
	They lasted about 44K miles.  They're good tires to about 35K miles.
	Traction is pretty good in dry and wet pavement but it's not a snow
	tire.  Currently I have Bridgestone Potenza RE71s.  If I was going
	to get tires again.  I would get the Dunlop SP8000.  You would get
	about 1/3 less tread life on the 8000s than the 4000s but the 8000s
	have more Traction on dry and wet pavement than the 4000s.
