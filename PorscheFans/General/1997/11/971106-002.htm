Cory; this is the porschefans list - you're looking for the 
porsche_idiots list...!  Only kidding, actually it sounds like something
I'd do, and I may steal your idea for my house!

You should try looking in Excellence magazine - towards the back you'll
find some porsche junkyards (uh, if you call them that, they'll get upset,
call them *dismantlers*!)  - they may be able to help you..

Also, you may have to be creative with your power source - horns require
a lot of current - thats why they have relays - you may not be able to use
a wall transformer alone - maybe a 12v gell-cell alarm battery would do the
trick, or one of those monster capaciters that the stereo people use...

Also, have you thought about how load a car horn is indoors?  you may
want a nite-disable switch, esp if you live in a dorm like I used to!

Boy, I sure miss all those beer/vodka/substance induced ideas I used to 
get in college - keep us posted!
