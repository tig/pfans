A while back, someone was asking about a joke to respond to a Cobra
driver's joke: What's the difference between a porcupine and a Porsche? 
With a porcupine, the prick is on the outside.  Something like that. 
Anyway, the following could be modified to be anything.  This version is on
USC:

Two USC grads drove to a gas station for a fill-up because they heard about
a contest being offered by the station to patrons who purchase a full tank
of gas.  When they went inside to pay, the men asked the attendant about
the contest.

"If you win, you're entitled to free sex," said the attendant.

"How do we enter ?" 

"Well, I'm thinking of a number between 1-10.  If you guess right, you win
free sex."

"O.K. I guess 7, " 

"Sorry, I was thinking of 8," replied the attendant.

The next week, the two USC grads returned to the same station to get gas. 
When they went inside to pay, the other Trojan asked the attendant if the
contest was still going on.

"Sure," replied the attendant. "I'm thinking of a number between 1-10, if
you guess right. You win free sex."

"2" 

"Sorry, I was thinking of 3," replied the attendant. "Come back soon and
try again."

As they walked back to the car, the first SC grad said to the other, "You
know, I'm beginning to think this contest is rigged."

"No way," said the other. "My wife won twice last week."
