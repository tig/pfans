We appreciate all the help ya'll have given us so far.  A very generous =
man on this mailing list donated the horns from his '73 911E (being =
converted for racing) for our project.  These arrived last monday after =
a donation for shipping and a six pack.  We wanted to really thank =
everyone on this porsche fans list after being slightly discouraged by =
the lack of help from the alt.autos.porsche newsgroup.  We also want to =
thank Donald Bond of the Lone Star region porsche club for telling us =
about PorscheFans in the first place.   Donald also said our idea was =
going to go into the next Porsche Newsletter....any word on that Donald? =
 Maybe we'll be famous.

To all who think this thing is going to be way too loud (several emails =
were about this), we're planning on putting the horns in some sort of =
sound insulating box above some acoustic tiles that are near our door.  =
We're also going to include the very important tip of adding a "night" =
switch to turn it off while sleeping, thanks Chuck.  Chuck also said he =
might steal our "beer/vodka/substance induced" idea for his =
house......does the patent office have a web page?  Maybe he won't have =
to pay any royalties because of the night switch idea.  Wait till ya'll =
find out what we're using as switches for the push buttons.

Well, my roomate and I are going to try and start working on the power =
supply this week(end) and then we'll have everthing we need.  Ideas for =
this would be appreciated since I've got to appropriate all of my =
brainpower for a thermodynamics test on thursday.  Thanks again to =
everyone and keep the ideas coming.  Maybe we'll make a web page about =
this over christmas break.
