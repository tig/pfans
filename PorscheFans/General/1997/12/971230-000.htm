Where can I get more info on the DME adjustment and are its effects negated by
the use of a Carrera Cup chip which we already have installed?   Tim Comeau

A Porsche SUV? What a bunch of horseshit!  Porsche already wasted millions of
dollars on the 4-door 989 project, embarrassingly enough. There is a saying in
German that is translated, "Shoemaker, stick to your last."  That is, Do what
you do best, do what you have been doing well. Porsche is first and foremost a
research and development facility. They also build sports cars. Not 4-doors
and not SUV's !!  I hope the Vorstand has the good sense to shoot down this
silly SUV idea. It reminds me of the annoying fact that their cars are
becoming too tame.  Too soft, too quiet, too comfortable, etc.  I agreed to
instruct a student in his boxster recently at an autocross. When I got in the
car I had to push the gas pedal and watch the tach to see if it was running!!
Two customers have come into the shop with their boxsters shortly after
purchasing them. They changed the exhaust so they could enjoy some sound from
the flat six that they knew was in there... somewhere, they went to lower and
stiffer springs, put on bigger wheels with bigger,lower profile tires, etc.,
things that should have been done at the factory!  Man,oh man.... 
What do YOU think of when you hear the name PORSCHE ?
Build it, race it, sell it.  It works.  Shoemaker, stick to your last. Build
REAL sports cars, okay?  Sheeesh.
