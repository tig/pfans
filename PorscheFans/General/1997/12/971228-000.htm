When I did tests for Pirelli a couple of years back, the N designation
on the P0 meant that the sidewall was of a different "rate", the compound
was slightly different and in some cases, the quality was better because
they would make them in their best plant.  I'm sure these have changed now.

Another thing I noticed recently was the treadwear rating of the Bridegstone
S-02 on a local twin turbo is 120.  If you buy the normal ones, it's
something like 140.  I don't know if this is just on delivered p-cars, or
if it was from a certain batch, but I've seen a twin turbo around here with
120 rating S-02's and mine are 140 rating.  Probably doesn't make a big
difference, but the N tires might be slightly softer.
