Re Andy and Nill's question about the "Nx" code listed on TireRack's
website:

Funny you should mention it, and another reason to join PCA.  This
month's Pano has an article on tires, and the author mentions these
codes!  The N-designation is called the "Original Equipment Approval
Code."

The author, Kim John Crumb, writes:

"There also might be an Original Equipment Approval Code.  Porsche has
their own testing criteria...beyond the standard industry benchmarks. 
These tires may differ from typical aftermarket tires in subtle ways. 
How do you identify these special tires?  The current Porsche-approved
street tire fitments are Bridgestone (S-02), Continental (Sport
Contact), Michelin (Pilot SX, MXX3) and Pirelli (P Zero).  Look for the
designation N0, N1, N2 or N3 on the sidewall.  There may also be prior
approved fitments in those same four brands, plus BFGoodrich (Europe),
Dunlop, Goodyear, Toyo, and Yokohama.  These tires may still be
available on the aftermarket and will carry N0, N1, or N2 designation. 
These Porsche spec tires may be good choices for those who want to
preserve the driving characteristics of a Porsche just as it came from
the factory."

That said, I've never seen it in real life, but that's apparently what
it means.

Holiday greetings to all,
