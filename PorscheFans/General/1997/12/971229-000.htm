This Years calendar I got it.. its about the evolutuion of Porsche...
each month shows a current car and its direct or spiritual predecessor...
for example Boxster and 550 Spyder... 911 Dual Turbo and 930 Carrera...

Its pretty sweet. Porsche is realy working this Evloution theme this year...
they have the Evolution of 911 1:43 scale model set... for 195bux you get 
a '64(911), '74, '90(964), '94(993), '98(996)... all done in Arctic Silver over
Boxster Red...
pretty sweet... also in Europe they have the Evolution Downhill bike... then
there are the Evolution posters, t-shirts... this is the theme for 98...
boxster was 97...98 is Evolution.

as for Porsche Challenge... weissach is my best track times.. here's the key...
spend a lot of time in Time Trial mode w/ the ghost car on... the keys to the
turns are... once your in 5th... at first drop down to 4th to get the feel for
the turns... once you have them down cold... stay in 5th but lay off the gass
going into the turn and once you hit the appex hit the gas... this will achieve
the best times... my best track time is 39secs last time I remember...

also keep playing the game cuz there are some sweet surprises in the game...
like the extra track, extra driver... different views... some nice goodies.

Hello All,

     I wanted to jot down a few lines quickly to express an opinion.  I have
noticed recently all the conversation about Windward Performance.  Everything
which I have read has been negitive and I am wondering if perhaps someone has
an ax to grind.

     My experience with Windward has always been professional, courteous and
helpful.   Items which I have pursched have been correct, priced properly and
delivered in a timely fashion.  I have spent a moderate sum with Windward for
my 89 930, (headers, turbo and Intercooler).  Everything has been as
represented, and the experience has been pleasant . . . contrary to my
experience with some mail order Porsche establishments.   Obviously there was
a problem with communication, but I have never had that problem.

     Additionally, one of the loudest protestors I believe is Alan Coleman.
Well, Alan, I am not sure I would put merit into anything you discuss . . .
and here is the reason why . . . I also own a 93 RS.   I read your article
concerning adjusting the potentiometer switch on the DME box's.   Boy do you
have a wrong number!   Yes, that switch is adjustable, if you know which way
to turn it, and which number box you have....every series and year box is
different.  I.E., a 93 doesn not adjust as an 91 does, and so on.    To listen
to you, they are all the same.       hmmm.          .wrong move.  I am
wondering how many individuals have damaged their engines with this
misinformation.   Seems Alan, if you care to become the town crier and smack
someone down, he without sin should cast the first stone, and perhaps not live
in a glass house.   Just my thoughts, wanted to share them.

PORSCHE CAN'T MEET RUNAWAY DEMAND
Porsche just closed the books on a record 1996/97 business year, and is unable
to meet runaway demand for its Boxster and 911 models. The carmaker said it
faced severe production bottlenecks which would cap the pace of continued
profit and sales growth in the current year ending in July, Reuter reports.
Orders, the company said, far exceeded expectations. Porsche said that group
pre-tax profit tripled in 1996/97 to $93.4 million.

Although the company expects sales and profit to grow at least 10 percent
again in the current year, Porsche is still unable to build enough of its two
models to meet demand. Porsche made 32,390 cars last year, and expects to make
about 38,000 this year at its plant outside Stuttgart and through a
contracted-manufacturer, Valmet in Finland.

Porsche's production problems lie with its suppliers which account for 80
percent of production. That limitation makes it hard, but not impossible for
Porsche to expand production at Valmet beyond the 5,000 Boxsters that it
expects to have built in Finland this business year.

Production bottlenecks, however, are a far cry from problems Porsche faced in
the early 1990s when it posted huge losses and appeared on the brink of going
out of business. Porsche has slashed costs, reduced its model range to only
two cars and become one of the auto industry's biggest success stories.

The company said sales in the first four months of the 1997/98 year were up
13.2 percent, with production up 16.3 percent at 9,700 units.

The latest sign of financial health at the company is robust demand for its
new 911 model, a water-cooled, somewhat larger version of the previous 911
which had been Porsche's flagship for more than three decades. The company
said the new car, which is more comfortable and quieter than its legendary
namesake, will appeal to a wider range of customers, helping Porsche break
into new markets.

As Porsche fights to keep production up to demand, it is considering adding a
third car to its product line -- a sports utility vehicle which it hopes will
reduce its dependence on the often fickle sportscar market. Porsche expects to
make a decision on the project by Spring 1998. The company is talking with two
other carmakers about jointly producing the car.
