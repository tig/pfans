Dear Mr Mellor

THE 1998 PORSCHE OWNERS DIRECTORY

I am a solicitor acting on behalf of Porsche Cars Great Bntain. and
David Raggett has asked me to write to you with regard to the above.

Both myself and my clients have reviewed the draft of the Directory, and
we have a number ot points and quite serious concerns which regrettably
render the Directory unacceptable as it currently appears. There are a
number of specific points that we have as well as some more important
general ones regarding the use of certain of our clients marks. What I
propose to do is go through the individual points and then deal with
those of more general application below.

The particular detailed points that we have are as follows:-

1.      All references to "Porsche Directory" must be changed throughout
to "Porsche Owners Directorv"
2.      There must be a disclaimer on the front ofthe Directory which
states that Porsche will not accept responsibility/liability for its
contents and any advice given therein. There should also be a statement
that the views expressed in the Directory are those of the author and
are not those of Porsche Cars Great Britain Limited or Porsche AG.
3.      Please remove all references to Adrian Hallmark and Porsche's
address, telephone/fax numbers as we do not believe it is necessary for
such details to be included.
4       The term "Porsche Service Agent' which is mentioned on page 10,
is not acceptable unless it is used in reference to an Official Porsche
Centre in which case, this term must be used instead. As covered in
greater detail below, the term "Porsche Specialist" is not acceptable
and must be removed throughout the Directory. The terms "Specialising in
Porsche Cars~ or "Specialist in Porsche Cars" is the acceptable
alternative. "Porsche Specialist" is a trade mark of Porsche.
6.        The phrase "neck snapping acceleration" appearing on page 9 is
unacceptable given that Porsche only encourages the responsible and safe
use of its products whether new. used or "classic" cars.
7.      The entire "Driving Style" section that appears on page 53 is
unacceptable as it currentl\' appears being both pointless and
gratuitously graphic.  A general statement advising careful driving is
more appropriate.  In the same way, the statement in the second
paragraph to the effect that "the car has more than enough
acceleration... [and] allow(s) you to entertain overtaking manoeuvres
that other cars and drivers won't even think about" is highly
inappropriate for the same reason..
8.      The section "The Eyes Have It" on page 81 is inappropriate for
the Porsche protile and brand images. Please remove paragraph 4,
particularly the sentence "with a Porsche you get a look that says speed
and, often, aggression". In the same way, paragraph 6 on page 81 must be
removed in its entirety. Any statement that encourages, condones or
describes aggress] ve driving is inappropriate and irresponsible.
9.       The references to "Chalcroff Body and Paint" on page 88 must be
removed.
10.     Uhe Lamborghini reference for '~Panel Wise" must be removed;
page 90.
11.     The reference on page 93 to "Top Gun Refinishing" is badly
worded and therefore misleading. Please amend the same.
1 2.    Any reference to the "Porsche Enthusiast Club" must be amended.
There is only one official Porsche Club which is entitled to use the
words "Porsche" in its name and this is not it. The only Club that is
authorised in this way is the Porsche Club Great Britain.
13.     The term "Porsche Breaker" on page 98 must be amended throughout
to read "breaker of Porsche Cars".
14.     The references on page 98 to both "Lodge Porsche" and "Porsche
Spares UK" must be removed throughout.
15.     An' entrv for "Porsche Club of Great Britain" must be referred
to as such and should not he abbreviated. Reference to it as "PCGB"
leads to confusion with "Porsche Cars Great Britain".
I 6.    The entry for "Porsche Racing Drivers Association" must be
removed please.
1 7.    Please remove the sentence "it is the Porsche Cars GB - located
showroom of AFN Group   page 119.
I 8.    Any reference to the term "Porsche Insurance" must be  removed
throughout as this encourages confusion with insurance schemes offered
by my clients yourselves with those provided by third parties.
I 9.    Steve Kevlm  does not work for Porsche Cars Great Britain -
please delete the reference on page 168.
20.     The phrase on page 186 in the third paragraph referring to the
"same expertise" is a misdescription and misleading and should therefore
be deleted.
21.     The reference on page 200 describing "Safe Drive" as a used
Porsche dealership should he deleted.

"Porsche Specialists"

Throughout the draft manuscript, there are references to the term
"Porsche Specialists", "Porsche Dealer". "Porsche Trained Technician",
"Porsche Service Specialists", etc. As I have already indicated above,
the term "Porsche Specialist" is an unregistered trade mark of my
clients along with the description "Official Porsche Centre".  Use of
other terms leads to confusion as the public tend to believe that there
is a link between independents using such terms and Porsche. 

Use by independent specialists of the trade marks "Porsche Specialist"
or "Porsche Specialists" is unregistered trade mark infringement and you
may be aware that Porsche, along with other trade mark proprietors has a
continuing programme of policing its trade marks.  We have therefore
been in contact with a considerable number of specialists who use the
"Porsche Specialists" trade mark.  Needless to say, the use of my
clients trade mark to describe independent traders should therefore be
deleted throughout the Directory. In the same way. any independent that
describes itself as a "Porsche Centre", or "Official Porsche Centre" is
likely to he infringing my clients unregistered rights in the "Official
Porsche Centre" trade mark. Consequently. references to independents
describing themselves using these terms should be deleted from the
Directory. The correct term for independent traders, is "XYZ
specialising in Porsche Cars". This is a purely factual description. Any
trader who uses any of the Porsche trade marks in its business name is
infringing my clients rights.

Correct Use of Porsche Trade Marks

Porsche trade marks should. as far as possible, be distinguished from
surrounding text by for example. the use of different script, font or
colour. At the least, words which are trade marks. sl~ould have a
capital initial. or better, appear in capitals throughout. or in
quotation marks. Trade marks should not be used as nouns or verbs, only
as adjectives, eg "a PORSCHE car" not "a PORSCHE". Trade marks should
not be hyphenated. pluralised or used in the possessive form. Such uses
encourage the view that the mark is a generic name.

The style and appearance of the trade mark should not be varied. Porsche
Ag is the proprietor of a large number of registered and unregistered
trade marks - you will be familiar with the form of ~e Porsche shield
and the Porsche script. The spelling and design of such marks should
never be embellished or altered. In the event that you intend to use any
pictorial representations of the Porsche shield. I would be grateful if
you would let me know as any colour or colours that form part of the
identitv of a trade mark should be reproduced correctly to ensure that
the right shades are used. We would also be concerned about the context
and way in which this important trade mark is used.

I have already referred above to the practice of a number of traders
using the trade mark "Porsche" as part of their trading or even company
name. This is most certainly trade mark infringement. The only entity
that is allowed to use the Porsche trade mark in this way are my
clients.

The Directory should also carry a statement at either the beginning or
end which indicates that those of mv clients trade marks that are
registered or unregistered are the property of Porsche Ag.

Please send a revised draft of the Directory to David Raggett at Porsche
Cars Great Britain limited. In the event that you have any questions.
please feel free to contact me.


Yours sincerely
