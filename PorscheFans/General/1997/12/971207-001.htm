This is a one time message to promote a charity fund raising project
being sponsored by the Florida Citrus Region PCA.  This is the same
calendar that was advertised in Pano and Excellence.

what day it is next year, and simultaneously be reminded of Porsche
cars?  Florida Citrus Region PCA and Big Brothers/Big Sisters are
sponsoring a full color 1998 Porsche calendar.  Production expenses
and effort have been underwritten by contributing sponsors and our
Region, such that ALL PROCEEDS GO TO BIG BROTHERS/BIG SISTERS (Checks
are made out to them).

The calendar features 13 professionally and creatively composed
Porsche photos ranging from 356's to a 906 and Boxsters.  Calendar
size is 8.5x11 spiral bound. The price is $15 plus $1.50 postage.
Quantity discounts.  You will not be disappointed in this product!
