Hello P-Fans
	This year I had the chance to attend a few World SportsCar GT-1 races. While
Hans Stuck is a very nice person - the "common knowlede" is that he is fast in
any car but is very hard on the equipment! When Hans steps into a race car he
will tear up the gearbox and brakes in just a few laps. There are quite a few
drivers just as fast Hans Stuck, but are not as hard on the car. Hurley
Haywood, Alan McNish come to mind, they could be in a car for hours and the
car is in perfect shape. Perhaps this is why his contract was not renewed?
