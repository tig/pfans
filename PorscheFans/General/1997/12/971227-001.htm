A while back Andy asked about 'N#' designations on the tire rack web
page. Since the webmaster is a member of team.net, I forwarded the
question onward to Bill Ozinga. So here it is straight from the horse's
mouth...

The N# designations are used on OE Porsche tires. Typically Porsche will 
work with the manufacturer to fine tune an existing tire to fit their 
requirements. The OE version is then called the N0. If the same tire is 
later updated, or reengineered for a different model of Porsche it's
then 
called an N1, then next time around is the N2, etc. This is the first 
time I can recall an N3 designation being used. Usually there aren't
that 
many revisions before a change in the tires model name.

If the tire does not have the N# designation, it's the standard 
aftermarket replacement version.
