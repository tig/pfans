My copy of the new Brian Long book "Porsche 914 & 914/6" arrived from
Amazon.com on 12/24. (ISBN 1-874105-84-7, list $39.95, Amazon.com $27.95)

The book is very good. 160 pages, mostly B&W photos, but with a color photo
section in the middle. Of particular interest is that essentially all the
photos in the book are authentic historical photos from the late 60's
through the 70's -- not modern photos of restored cars.

It has a lot on the early history of the car, including many photos of the
pre-production and test cars. Then it goes into great detail of each model
year. Also includes a good section on the 914 as a race car. Has a section
on other cars based on the 914 chassis, and appendicies of specs, details,
original prices and options.

Another big plus is that is has a very positive view of the car. Describing
it as the "Cinderella" Porsche -- that wasn't as fully appreciated for its
merits until after it was discontinued.

Overall, I'd rate it well worth the cost, and an enjoyable addition to a 914
owner's collection.
