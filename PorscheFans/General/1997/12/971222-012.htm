Hi P-fans,

I recently put up a web site for Porsche fans to get together and chat.  =
I had posted the announcement on all the lists but recently was informed =
that only my 911 posts got sent due to not being subscribed to all the =
lists.  I have reattached the previous messages for your reading.   The =
site is growing everyday.  I have introduced contests and have plans for =
a vendors page and an e-mail directory of p-fans.  Please by all means =
surf on over and check out the site.  let me know of any suggestions you =
may have
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---------------------
I was thinking I might set up a web site where p-fans from everywhere =
could get together on a web based chat forum to talk in real time about =
interests, events, problems, and concerns. I would also like to have a =
links list of all who participate in this digest. With locations and =
e-mail and url address. There would also be an archive of previous =
digest issues on line for people to browse for any missed information. =
If anyone thinks this would be a good idea and would be interested in =
such a site please let me know on the digest or e-mail me. I wouldn't =
want to put up this site if it was in vain. I look forward to your =
input.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----------------------

A few days back, I mentioned that I was planning to put up a web site =
where people from this mailing list could get together and chat about =
repairs, experiences etc
Well the site is up!. It's called the Porsche Fans Lounge. I have set up =
a test site for now. The site is done in frames. The chat room is up and =
running. The room is linked up with another room for now so there is =
traffic there. I will be demerging the room in 1 weeks time. The=20
chat program is pretty versatile. You can change your text color,=20
include a picture. The refresh rate is quick and is easy to use. The=20
e-mailer and main page are also up. The links page needs some=20
additional links, if you want yours put there e-mail me with it. The=20
archives, and pictures pages have to be set up. I do have to make some =
finishing touches though. Please check it out, make any suggestions.  =
Hopefully We can make this site a place to get together to socialize and =
hav e good time!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------------
In reference to the site I have created called "The Lounge"
.. I am looking for someone to do weekly editorials about topics of=20
interest. Things like new models, repairs, experiences, events etc. So =
if you think you have something to say here's your chance. E-mail=20
me...... or go directly to the site and read the notice in the archives =
page. =20

have a good time. Here is the URL
