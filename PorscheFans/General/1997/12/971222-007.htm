I really was joking when I said, "Hope this doesn't turn into a repeating
email."
Unfortunately, of all the times in the last year I have posted to multiple
lists at once, this is the time
that the message bug has caught up to me, apparently.  Thanks to all the
people
who have written me and expressed their feelings in detail, I love you too.
Perhaps this is the way the people of the City of Constantine felt when
they first saw
the Crusaders at their gates.  (We're all Christians  here, we all want the
same things, maybe they just want to be our friends!)
