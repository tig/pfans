Hi Steve.  I recall reading the article now that you and someone else
mentioned it.  I've also never seen this N designation in real life.  I notice
Tire Rack sells the S02's that fit my car (205/55 ZR16 & 225/50 ZR16) in both
non-N and N3 rated.  Same price too.  I wonder if there is some kind of
difference, I would imagine not since they are the same tire.  Now that I
know, I think I'll request the N3 ones just for the heck of it. :)

Happy Holidays,
