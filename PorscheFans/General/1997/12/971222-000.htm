Just a FYI post:

 I had took my car to the Wheel Works in Santa Clara, CA
to have new rears mounted. When I got home and looked at the
rims I have a scratch that runs around the rim edge and a gouge
in a spoke. (both sides). So I returned to the shop and showed
them the problem. First they said they would take care of it. Then I
was told to call back at 3:00pm (friday) which I did. The shop manager
told me to come down on Monday. I showed up and he looked at them.

 From there he (fred) said his best guy worked on it and that I was
trying to get my rims fixed for free. Basically call me a Liar. I should
of told him first that these are scratch free rims (he said this). Very
unprofessional. I have called the main office and filed a complaint.

Bottom line: Beware and watch those guys like a hawk. I will file a 
complaint and a claim on my insurance, I will never use them again. 

Now the choice is yours.

The idea that Hans is hard on equipment doesn't make sense given the fact that
the factory has chosen him so many times to drive at endurance races like the
24 hours of Le Mans, Daytona and the 12 hours of Sebring. I would question who
you heard that from. Why would the factory chose someone who they thought
might use the car up in a short time or break it?  Ich denke nicht.

I was told by a top private team running WSC (old IMSA). This team has to pay
for their equipment! Hans is very quick - buy is brutal on the equipment!

You obviously knew enough about what causes the repeating messages to know
there was a risk in whatever it was you were doing.  

Therefore, there isn't any goddamed excuse for it.

Your message is now repeating.  Your hopes didn't do any good.  Next time post
individual messagesto the lists, not cross posts to many lists.
