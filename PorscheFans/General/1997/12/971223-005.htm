<HTML><PRE><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=5><B>Dolphin Track Test Will Showcase
Dolphin Pulse Charged High-Power Engine in Super-Fast Sports Car

<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3></B>    BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec.
23, 1997--BAT 
International's (OTC:BAAT) subsidiary, Dolphin ACI, has decided to 
showcase a high-power Dolphin Pulse Charged engine now in its Magnum 
sports car in the super-efficient vehicle test run on Jan. 15 at 
Capitol Speedway in Fontana, Calif.

    Dolphin announced in a Dec. 12 news release that it will be 
completing a track test on Jan. 15, 1998, to demonstrate the fuel 
efficiency of a newly completed super-efficient engine in a 
four-door Geo Metro.  The company is anticipating reaching at least 
80 miles per gallon at 60 mph as a result of Dolphin's proprietary 
Pulse Charge technology.

    The same technology that provides high efficiency can also 
provide very high power.  The company is planning to allow celebrity 
race car drivers to test the new high-power Pulse Charge engine 
technology in a Magnum Sports Car at Capitol Speedway to demonstrate 
how it can impact speed and acceleration in vehicles.

    Dolphin owns Magnum Car Co. (formerly owned by Sumitomo).  
Several of the chassis have been used to test Dolphin Pulse Charged 
high-power engines.

    Recent informal road tests of a Pulse Charged 2.3-liter, 
4-cylinder, Type IV Porsche 914 engine in a Magnum resulted in 
acceleration of 0 to 60 miles per hour in only 4.2 seconds.  This is 
faster than some of the finest sports cars, including Lamborghini and
Ferrari, that use very expensive 12-valve engines.  Dolphin technology 
is both very high-power and very inexpensive to manufacture.  
Little retooling investment is needed to bring it to market.

    Dolphin has tested Dolphin Pulse Charge technology in 
approximately 20 different race car engines.  Power improvements of 
30-50 percent have been achieved as a result of Dolphin Pulse Charge 
technology.  The most surprising result is that Dolphin Pulse 
Charging can improve both power and fuel efficiency.

    In one recent test by an independent racing group, a Dolphin 
Pulse Charged Porsche engine was able to achieve both a 25 percent 
improvement in power and 30 percent improvement in fuel efficiency 
in dyno testing.  A summary of recent test results is as follows: 
-0-
*T

Engine                HP before   HP after   Fuel efficiency gain

Porsche 3.8 L 911
 RSR Race Engine         340        380      33 percent (first test)
Standard Porsche 
 3.2 L Carrera Engine    220        330      30 percent (estimated)
Modified Porsche 914,
 2.3 L Race Engine       160        235      30 percent (estimated)

*T

    BAT is planning to license a whole array of engine technologies 
to major auto manufacturers immediately after the demonstration run 
in January.  The ability to provide engine technology that can be 
both very-high-power and very-high-fuel-efficiency will be very 
important in these license discussions.

    BAT is also discussing with several overseas companies possible 
joint ventures to enter into production of high-power, high-speed 
sports cars using Magnum chassis technology.

    According to an editorial in November 1997 in Automotive 
Industries, Jac Nasser, president of Ford Automotive Operations,
recently gave a speech to the auto industry that low price/earning 
ratios and return on sales were the result of a lack of inventiveness
and integration of new technology to remain competitive.

    He was paraphrased as saying, "He was advocating a new world order
where suppliers come forward with new, wild ideas, things that have 
never been tried, and the automakers listen."  Dolphin is prepared to
bring the next generation of engine technology to the auto industry 
in January.
