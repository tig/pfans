Yes, it does on the CIS system. There is a book entitled 'Bosch Fuel =
Injection Systems which gives a thorough explanation of how all Bosch =
systems function, from the L,K, & CIS injections systems thru Motronics. =
You might also want to check that your injectors are not leaking.
You might want to post e-mail on the 924/944 page as well.

There is, NO SUBSTITUTE!!!

Hello P-Fans
	There are only so many components, that can make your 928 use excessive fuel
and flood out. The first thing you should do is check the fuel system
pressure.  Since you have replaced the fuel damper, fuel pump (?), and the
fuel pressure regulator - that only leaves a few components left. I suspect
that the system pressure is sky high. This can be caused by the fuel return
line being restricted. There is a "check valve" either built into the fuel
pump or right before the pump, where the fuel return line goes into the fuel
tank. On 944's the check valves part number is: #944-608-951-00  $10, and
attaches inside of the fuel supply line just before the fuel pump. 
	On  most cars, the fuel pressure regulator fails intermittently, since the
regulator is mounted on the return side of the fuel rail, this can cause the
fuel pressure to go sky high as well. The coolant temp sensor(s) could be bad.
There are usually two sensors on CIS cars. One is a basic sensor, the other is
usually called a 80% switch. The 80% switch would also be a likely suspect for
a overly rich running engine. The air flow sensor plate height could be out of
adjustment. A vacuum leak could also cause a overly rich running engine.
				

							Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

For many years I was a corner worker for IMSA and SCCA races in the
Southeastern US.  In 1979 I came into possession of a BBS modular racing wheel
and tire that had come off of Peter Gregg's 935 at the Daytona midnight race
on July 4th.  Eventually I made a coffee table, using the wheel & tire and a
40 x 40 sheet of half-inch scratch-resistant acrylic, with rounded corners and
polished edges.  This is RSA, or Rubber-Strengthened Acrylic, and to this day
does not have a single scratch on it.

I got married a year ago, and the decor in my living room has slowly evolved
from racing posters, car models, and piles of Road & Track to Matching-This-
and-That and glass and wrought iron tables and genuine framed prints and stuff
on the walls.  Alas, the Porsche coffee table must go.  I am asking $250,
which is pretty firm if I must pack it and ship it cross-country.  If you can
pick it up, we can talk.
