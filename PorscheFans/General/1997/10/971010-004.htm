Well...I don't exactly drive the hottest Porsche ever made, but she is a 
pretty looking car.  Yeah, I flash lights, and even sort of 
embarrassedly wave at other Porsches here in Europe.  The other day I 
got to drive my car for a couple of days up and down the Domiziana, 
along the Tangenziale in Naples and gee whizz, a newish 911 Carrera 2 
comes zipping up alongside.

The driver was greying, sort of 'executive' looking in the Italian 
manner, and wholly enthusiastic about my car- swapping lead, zooming 
about-  probably both pretty stupidly.  We honked, we waved, and 
shit...I was really pleased and embarrassed- like one is, I suppose.

Good deal for Italian P-fans, doing it right.  They ALL wave!!  So now 
you know-  drive here!!

P.S.  Extra pleasure as I was supposed to be in car-less Romania at the 
time!!

Yeah, yeah...it's not the model, it's the MARQUE.
