Nill - the most important thing to take to your first drivers school is the
proper attitude.  I always tell my students to relax, enjoy themselves, set
goals for the weekend, set goals for each driving session, and remember that
they want to drive the car home in the same condition that it began the 
weekend.  If you damage your car, it's very likely that you'll never drive
on the track again.  There's no reason to push to the very limit - keep a
little in reserve and drive only as fast and as aggressively as you and the
instructor both feel comfortable with.  Remember that the instructor is there
for a reason - usually because he or she is very experienced, knows a lot
about high speed driving, and enjoys teaching these skills to others.  Pay
very close attention to what the instructor says.
 
Specifics related to your car and Road Atlanta:
1.  Road Atlanta is a high speed and unforgiving track.  You do not want to spin or
go off the track, especially at turn 5, the "dip", turn 11, or turn 12.  The last
drivers school I went to a few weeks ago there saw four cars wrecked on Saturday
alone - two at turn 11, one on the front straight (on its roof), and one at turn
five.  So behave yourself at Road Atlanta.  Having said that, you will find that
it is incredibly exciting to drive, with the elevation changes, challenging turns,
blind turns, and high speeds.
2.  Make sure you have good brake pads (not nearly worn out), NEW brake fluid,
a firm brake pedal, a good fan belt properly adjusted, secure battery, working
brake lights, and no major oil leaks at the engine.  Front wheel bearings 
should be tight but not binding.  Obviously your seat belts and other safety
related items need to be in excellent condition.  Tires should be in good
physical condition but not brand new - the car will handle worse with full
tread depth because of squirming tread blocks.  This is why racers shave their
street tires.  Be cautious of your tires until you get them well scrubbed in at
the track.
3.  Use the pressures that Porsche recommends for high speed driving on your
car - probably about 4-6 PSI more in the rear than in the front.  There will
be lots of other 911 drivers there to give you advice on tire pressures.
4.  The 911 is challenging to drive fast and very rewarding when you get it 
right.  Pay attention to the transition from understeer to oversteer that you
will begin to notice, and the effect that weight transfer and throttle position
have on the handling balance of the car.  If you don't know what I'm referring
to, ask your instructor to help you with these things.
5.  Helmet - Snell SA95, make sure you try it on before you buy it, several
places in Atlanta including the pro shop at Road Atlanta itself.
    Numbers - White shoe polish is the easiest and cheapest.  You can get some
eight inch high vinyl stick on numbers from any sign shop for a few bucks, but
be very careful when you peel them off after the drivers school - you don't want
to peel the paint off with the numbers.
 
I hope this is helpful to you.  Have a great time!
