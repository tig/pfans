I'm going down from Marin county both Saturday and Sunday...driving my 951.
I haven't heard of any special parking arrangements, but that sure would be
nice considering Porsche is a sponsor of the event. I'm a GGR member but
haven't heard about any PCA-related activities--just received the latest
Nugget a few days ago and there was no mention of the race.

For those of you who haven't heard, the weekend features both a FIA World
GT race and the Exxon Supreme GT race (GTS-1, -2, and -3). Porsche's new
GT1 car will be present, including two factory entries; you'll have the
opportunity to see cars and teams not often seen on this side of the pond.
Of the 42 cars on the provisional entry list, 17 are Porsches.

Monterey is a short distance from the Bay Area, and it's a pleasant drive.
Come out and support your favorite marque and professional sports car
(capitalization intentional) in the US!
