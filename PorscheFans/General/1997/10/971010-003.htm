Also consider replacing the rear glass as well. Rear glass is changed a lot
less often than front and the gasket can get old. In my car it allowed water
to seep in and  eventually I got rust underneath the right rear seat which
meant R&Ring the motor and buying a rear clip to get the panel I wanted. It was
a huge project for the small amount of rust involved.

The punishment seemed far worse than the crime, but rust is not
fair and it never sleeps.
