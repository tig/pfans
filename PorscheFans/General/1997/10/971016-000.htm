I wasn't in that group yesterday morning, but what you describe is fairly 
common. One day I counted fifteen P-cars on the bridge, although not all 
moving in the same direction. I frequently travel in groups of three or 
four during the evening commute--last week there were four of us across 
all of the Northbound lanes: two 911s, a 928, and my 951. Talk about 
representation of the marque--it must look like a parade!

See you on the bridge.
