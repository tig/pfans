About ten years ago I decided to do a complete paint job on my 73
coupe.  I decided to do a lot of the work myself and proceded to take
the car apart, even removing the engine and then deliver it to my
painter.  the painter took three months to complete the job and it was
better than new, always drawing attention because it looked so good.  
Well two month's ago I rearended someone, did a number on the hood, left
front fender hood holdown pannel, bumper, basically tor the front end
off my car,  when we removed the left front fender I was shocked to find
rust between the body and the fender, especially up near the windshield
cowl.  I thought I had done a great job when I had the car painted ten
years ago.  I then decided to take off the right fender and rust was
present there also.  The moral of the story is, If you have an earlier
car that is not galvanized, you are thinking about doing a complete
paint job,  DO NOT HESITATE TO TAKE OFF BOTH FENDERS.  If you don't you
are doing yourself an injustice.  I live in Northern California where
"we don't have rust"  don"t be fooled.  My car is always garaged and
kept immaculate.  the other advice is when you replace your windshield,
make sure you use only OEM rubber and fit the glass to the gasket. 
Another place where rust can ruin your precious car.
