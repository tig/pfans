Hi Lon,

I rebuilt both of my mirrors for my '82 SC in about 3 hours.  I have power
mirrors and the worst part was having to cut the wires to get the entire
mirror off the door.  Just make sure that you write down which wires go
where if they are not color coded.  Of course, taking the mirror off was
easy because I already had all of the door pannels off, etc.. 

What has happened is the 'bolt' has loosened and no longer compresses a
spring within the mirror assembly.  This spring allows the mirror to rotate
on the post if it gets hit while also keeping the mirror stable for regular
driving.  Unfortunatly, the wires run through a hole in the middle of this
'bolt' which is also where the allen wrench goes to tighten it.  In effect,
you have to take the whole mirror apart to tighten it.

The first thing you have to do is gently pry your mirror glass off of it's
mounting plate so you can unscrew the power mirror motor from the cast body
part.  Once you take out the motor and wires you can disassemble and clean
the 'bolt', spring, and any nylon parts that may or maynot have been there.
I used a good spray of WD40 to get all the grime off and then wiped
agressivly with a rag.

When you are ready to put the whole thing back together put some all purpose
greese in it so it can rotate freely.

It is also good to have two new mirror to door seals on hand in case the old
ones are crap.  In my case, both had been cut so the car could be painted
and tehy did not fit well or provide a good seal.  You might also think
about rplacing the allen bolt used to secure the mirror to the door if it
has gotten a little rusty.

I have left out a lot of the details because it is a very straight forward
task that any p-fan could do.

Have fun!
