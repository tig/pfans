James:

Every time a cylinder in your engine fires, some combustion
by-products blow past the rings into the crankcase.  In order to
keep the crankcase seals from bursting under this pressure, the
crankcase must be vented.

In cars that aren't subject to emissions-control rules (and -- don't
tell anyone -- in my car), the crankcase breather is just vented to
the atmosphere through a catch-bottle which captures any liquid oil
that happens to be blown out along with the vapor.

In all other cars, the breather hose is routed into the air
cleaner... The idea is that the petroleum vapors will be recycled
through the engine and won't escape into the atmosphere.

When you see engine oil in the air cleaner, it nearly always came 
from the crankcase breather... It IS possible that your engine was 
overfilled, since that might allow liquid oil to splash up into 
the crankcase breather.
