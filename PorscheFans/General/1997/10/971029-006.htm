Hi,

I haven't seen too much written about the FIA GT and WSC races at LSRW
over the weekend, so I thought I would give my perspective as someone who
hasn't seen this type of racing in quite awhile.  One word is all that is
needed: AWESOME!  Ok... I'll write more...  it could get long...

We spent all day Saturday and Sunday at the track and it was by far one =
of
the greatest racing weekends I can remember since the "good ol' days" =
when
I used to watch CAN-AM racing at Road America.  Why an event such as this
doesn't draw the huge crowds like the CART guys do is beyond me.  There
was a terrific amount of racing action and the sounds... oh, the sounds.
They were really incredible.  Here's my impressions.

*  Most Raucous Power Sound: Panoz GT with mighty Ford V-8

You could  *feel * as well as hear this car coming long before it was in
front of you.  Hearing them fire-up in the Paddock to drive out to the
grid was quite a thrill and not for the faint of heart!  I expected the
huge Viper V-10 to sound like the Panoz, but it had a much nicer, throaty
sound, as opposed to the "in your face."

*  Sexiest Loud Sound: BMW V-12 engine in the McLaren F1 GTR

This was a truly amazing sounding car.  It was SO loud, but at the same
time, very sexy sounding.  I had the pleasure (?) of standing directly
behind one in the Paddock as it fired-up.  The instant crack of the
exhaust note is something I won't soon forget.  Fantastic sounding
downshifts too.  My favorite overall.  The BMW M3 GTS-3 car also sounded
great.  BMW does know how to make them sound great.

*  Sexiest Not-So-Loud Sound: Ferrari V-10 in the 333SP World SportsCar

Pure silk.  Smooth and powerful, but not too loud.

*  Fastest Car With the Lamest Sounding Engine:  AMG Mercedes V-12 CLK =
GTR

I suppose Mercedes engineers should get some kind of award for being able
to design a 6 liter V-12 that has almost no sound.  You almost thought it
was turbine powered.  Not my cup of tea.

*  Best Sounding Turbo Car:  Porsche 911 GT1

The Porsche turbo was quite a bit louder than the Mercedes GTR and it
sounded very smooth and powerful.  Still no match for the normally
aspirated BMW though in shear excitement.

Now, on to the GT1/GT2 race, which was the featured 3 hr Sunday race.

At the end of qualifying it looked like the Mercedes team would clean up
in GT1 as all three of their cars were on top, followed by a couple of
Porsche GT1s, a BMW McLaren or two and another Porsche GT1, plus other
assorted contenders such as more McLarens, Lotus Elise GT1s and Panoz =
GTRs
(as I recall).  There were about 20 GT1 cars and 20 GT2 cars in the race.
Leading qualifiers in GT2 were the Vipers and the many Porsche 911s.

We were very fortunate in our choice of seating position for the start of
the race as we chose to sit in the grandstands by turn 4.  From there you
could see the cars at the end of the front straight, some of the hairpin,
and most of turn 3, all of turn 4 and a lot of turn 5, where quite a bit
of passing took place under heavy braking.  Sometimes the cars were three
abreast as they approached the turn.

So, the race is on and at the end of the first straight going into the
hairpin it was apparent that the leader was one of the Mercedes GTRs.
Much to our surprise, one of the Porsche GT1s out braked the two other
CLKs and dove down into 2nd place entering the hairpin.  Then as the cars
started to exit turn 3 the leading CLK, driven by Bernd Schneider and
Klaus Ludwig, swung a bit wide and got one rear wheel off into the dirt.
That was all it took for the #47 Porsche GT1 of Allan Mcnish and Ralf
Kelleners to take the lead.  The crowd cheered as they went by turn 4.  =
We
loved it!

The #47 Porsche continued to pull away and seemed like it would be in
great position to win, however, an unexpected pit stop later in the race
cost them a minute and the win.  But for the first 10 laps or so it was
Porsche #47, Mercedes #11, Porsche AG #7, and Mercedes #10 and #12.  They
all circled within a car length or two of each other with the Gulf Team
Davidoff BMW McLaren F1s not far behind.  The Porsche AG GT1 #6 car with
Hans Stuck and Thierry Boutsen was well up in the pack also but it was
involved in an early altercation of some kind and passed us with its =
right
front fender decorating the windshield.  This put them out of contention
to win, but they still managed to finish 5th after replacing the front
nose section.

After the impromptu pit-stop Porsche #47 tried their hardest to come back
and still managed a very strong 3rd place finish.  If the race had lasted
30 minutes longer they might have won as they were gaining ground at the
end.  Meanwhile the Porsche AG car #7 with Yannick Dalmas and Bob Wollek
at the wheel had worked its way solidly into a 2nd place finish.  After
qualifying 1st and 3rd, the #12 and #10 Mercedes CLKs finished a
disappointing 7th and 8th.  Gulf Team Davidoff BMW McLarens nailed down
the 4th, 6th and 10th positions.  The Panoz GTR #5 finished 5th, and a
Lotus Elise was 9th.  Team BMW Motorsport was back there somewhere...

Other impressions in no particular order...

The AMG Mercedes team oozed money.  Nothing but the finest, from the
unbelievable team car rig to the equally impressive 18 wheeler that
supplied the filet mignons and other amenities for lunch.

Gulf Team Davidoff had the sexiest,  friendliest, "female PR person."  A
real English delight.

Peter Kox of Team BMW Motorsport was the cutest driver according to my
wife :-)

These cars have impressive braking capability!  Going into turn #5 the
discs on the Mercedes, Porsche, and McLaren cars glowed red hot as they
wretched all the stopping power out of the tires and pavement!

All the teams were very accommodating to the throngs of people in the
Paddock, especially on Sunday.

Bottom line:  if you have a chance to hit Sebring or Laguna Seca next
year, do not miss it.  You will see the best in the world and have a =
great
time doing it.  Oh yeah, the 75 degree days and clear blue skies in the
Monterey area didn't hurt either.  Unfortunately, I'm now back in dark =
and
wet Seattle :-(

Til next year,
