              was NOT involved in a accident!

Dear Mike & P-fans
	I do not mean "flame" or "ream-you -out" but You are Wrong! 
	Rohr racing did not race their GT-1 car nor their GT-2 car at Laguna! Mike
you said and I quote: "Guess there was a multiple car incident on Thursday
which the Rohr car was involved in". 
	The FACTS.	 The Rohr Racing team clinched the championship manufactures
title at Sebring. Rohr did not need to run either car at Laguna Seca. Why
risk it?  Since Rohr Racing made Porsche AG proud - they were invited by
Porsche @ Sebring to campaign the Factory FIA GT-1 for the Laguna ( Porsche
team car #47 ?) Seca Raceway Race. The Rohr GT-1 car was not involved in any
"accident" @ Laguna!  
	We/Rohr were involved in a "little" body contact @ Sebring - on the last
lap, third turn to the Checker flag! Seems the Panoz team was behind the Rohr
car and did not have enough power or time to get around us. The Panoz car
simply "bunted" the Rohr car in the "butt" and spun us out their way! Very
much a Dale Earnhart move! The Panoz car took the "checkered flag". Rohr car
finished 2nd in GTs-1. But the officials placed a 30 second penalty to the
Panoz car - bumping them to third in GTs-1. The Rohr Porsche finished 1st
overall at Sebring!  The Rohr car only needed to finish 2nd at Sebring in
order to clinch the manufacture season championship! 
	I know that all of this is true because I was there. I was a crew member for
Rohr Racing in the last few races this year. Look us up next year at 24 Hours
of Daytona!  We hope to win Daytona again in '98!  For all of you Porsche
fans out their the team is very low key. We did not have those crushed velvet
barriers to keep the fans out! Plenty of people got to get right up to the
car in the paddock and touch Porsche Newest Car - 911 GT-1 Car! We even had
plenty of freebies (posters and post cards) for the fans signed by the
drivers. Most of the other FIA cars kept you back 10 meters at least! Hope to
see you at the races next year! 
	By the way the GT-2 car is for sale - first $250K takes it! See Northland
Porsche web site for more details!
