This should be on the FAQ or a prominent Web page, but I can't seem to find it again.

Some time ago I ran across a reference to the details on how to order the Cardex for a Porsche. If you don't know, and as I understand it, this document originated with Porsche AG when they built any given unit and detailed every option that was factory installed.

Whatever it was I read/saw/heard, the indication was that PCNA had given the task of fielding requests for all cars up through a certain year to some company in Utah or Nevada. You had to supply your VIN and about US$30, and in return they'd mail you the document in a few weeks.

Far as I can see this ought to be on somebody's list of frequently asked questions but I can't seem to find it a second time. If you know, please help.

Thanks,
--Steve.
