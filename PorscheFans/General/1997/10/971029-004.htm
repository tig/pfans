Many years ago I worked at the EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Laboratory in Ann
Arbor, Michigan.  The lab tested emissions and fuel economy on all vehicles
before they could be certified for sale in the US.  Most manufacturers would
'hand build' prototype or the next years running train and install it in a
car body from the current year.  We would see 1979 Porsches with 1980 or even
1981 running gear.  After testing was complete, PCNA (at that time a part of
VOA and run out of the Detroit area) typically sold these cars through the
local Ann Arbor Porsche dealer.  Other manufacturers had other ways of
disposing of the vehicles, ranging from destroying them to selling them to
their employees.  Porsche fans on the staff considered these prototypes to be
very desirable as they were 'custom built' vehicles.  Thus, there are a few
Porsches out there with later year, or possibly confusing serial numbered
engines that were the certification prototypes.
