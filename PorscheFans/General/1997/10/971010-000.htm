Anyone need 356B or 924 Sebring literature?

The 356B catalog is the Ken Purdy brochure featured in the latest issue of Der Sammler.
I have a few spare copies of this 8 page color catalog from 1963 ("...delivers more sheer

sensual pleasure than anything else on wheels"). For those too young to have known
the many wonderfully literate automotive articles Ken Purdy published during the '50s

and '60s, lets just say few could touch him on words. P. of A. commissioned Ken to do
this catalog,. I have a few excellent copies. Will trade , or $20 plus $2 post.


Going back a few issues to Der Sammler Vol. 1 no. 5, the 1979 924 Sebring color folder
was described. This one has lots of wonderful color photos of racing 924s AND 935s at

various tracks. I have a few of these (W73-769-6020) in excellent condition. Will trade, or
$12 plus $2 post. Please email to reserve first.

Don't know Der Sammler? If you care about Porsche paper you NEED this most-

specialized of niche magazines, now with color. Email the editor, Tim Comeau, for info 
(AntaresTC@aol.com). No, I don't get paid for this; just a happy subscriber.

Brochures I need:

1965 911 "Makers of cars for the individualist", 12 pg catalog, orange car on cover.          
1970 911 T/E/S "No matter which Porsche you get, it's got it's own story", folder.

1972 911 "Once you buy a Porsche, there is no other kind of car", 16 pg catalog.
1975 911 S/Carrera "Porsche. There is no substitute", 34 pg catalog
1976 911 S/Turbo Carrera/912 "Porsche"   

Posters I need:
1969 Spa
1970 Targe Florio
1970 Spa

1976 Vallelunga

I also need Porsche racing team apparel. 

Send me your list of Porsche paper.
