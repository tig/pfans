Hi,

I'm seriously looking at an out of state purchase of a 1989 944 Turbo =
that
is offered for sale at a Porsche dealer.  The car in question is Azure
Blue with Linen interior and partial leather front seats.  Mileage is
66,233 and the car was sold and maintained by this dealer for all of its
history, which is 3 local owners I believe.  I don't have a list yet of
the services that have been performed, but the salesman implied that
"nothing major" has ever been done.  I would take that to mean that the
car has the original clutch.  This Pcar was traded in on a 1986 911 Turbo
and has been on the dealer's lot for about 6 weeks, so I would assume =
they
would want to move it.  I also believe this 951 has an aftermarket
stainless exhaust and some kind of cone air filter.  The salesman is
checking on these items.

Since I have never purchased a used vehicle from a dealer, I'd like to
know how much negotiating room I might have.  The asking price is =
$19,995.
Depending on whether I look at Edmund's or Kelley, the retail "book" =
value
(which probably does not apply for a car such as this) is anywhere from
$15,900 to $19,000 based on the substantial mileage adjustment =
recommended
by Edmund's.  Trade-in value was probably much less than $13K.

Bottom line:  What would any of you offer for this car?  I'm thinking
around $17,000 if it is as nice as they say and I can determine that the
clutch is original.

Also, since this car is at the only Porsche dealer within miles, should I
just go by their service records to decide its condition, or should I try
to arrange for an inspection elsewhere (which I think would be a waste of
time and money).  I've already talked to the service manager, and he says
it is a really clean car that was owned by a Porsche fanatic (is there =
any
other kind!).  The dealer took some pictures of the car today and is
sending them ASAP.

Thanks for any advice.
