Kevin,
This is why anti-seize compound shoulds ALWAYS be used on threads,
particularly
of unlike metals.  I had a similar problem with the Nissan Sentra that I
bought
for my son.  Blow around the plugs with compressed air to remove any
road dirt, stones,
etc, that may have accumulated over time around the plugs.  You don't
want it 
falling in when the plugs come out. Next, Lots and lots of WD-40 and
TIME. Soak the
plug/engine head area with WD-40. When you unloosen 1/8 turn, respray
WD-40  and turn 
the plug back in.  This will help the WD get to the uncoated threads. 
Then turn the plug
out till it binds, re-spray and turn back in again.  Keep repeating this
process til the
plug can be removed without forcing. It will take some time. When
putting in new plugs..ANTI-SEIZE!
Regards,
And good luck.
