Hello

I was at Bridgehampton for three days this past weekend with Metro PCA.
I was driving my 89 951 for what might have been the last time ever at
the Bridge.  Here are some mostly random notes from the event. This
will probably be a little on the long side, so delete it now if you're
not interested.

Maintenance Problems:

This event saw a lot of minor and not so minor mechanical problems. 
There are always going to be some problems, but at this this event 
I had my fair share. That's sort of strange for me, because I've been
real lucky so far. Perhaps my luck is running out.

Friday morning one friend discovered that his batter was dead. He had
Napa deliver a battery to the track, and we install it in 10 minutes.
No big deal there.

My problems started Friday afternoon when I saw that I was leaking
coolant from somewhere. It was a tiny leak, but I could smell it and
see traces of coolant in the engine compartment. I couldn't ID the
problem at the track.  That night (I live 50 miles from the track, and
drove home each night) I pulled the airbox cover and saw that one
corner of the airbox cover was rubbing against a hose and wore a
pinhole leak in it. I patched it and put it back on. Of course,
Porsches being Porsches, it was a real pain to get to the hose. One of
the clamps must be oriented a certain way to allow everything to fit.

Get to the track the next day. Remove stuff from car. BS with some
people.  Return to car to find a puddle of coolant under car. DAMN!
check it and find that I didn't tighten one clamp enough. Of course,
it's the clamp that's the pain to get to. Remove parts that are in the
way. Try to find the right collection of tools in my track tool box
(minimum amount of tools). Burn my fingers on hot parts but finally get
everything together.  No more leaks.

One guy at the track is looking for some tools and advice. He has a new
911TT, and one of the brake dust shields was loose (what is the purpose
of those things anyway?). I loan him a jack and jackstands, and my
toolbox. Of course, he doesn't even know how to jack the car up, so I
give him a hand.  We remove the wheel, then find that we have to remove
the caliper and brake disk to get at the cover. There are four bolts
that hold the cover on. Two are gone, and the other two are almost
gone. At this point I am busy working on my coolant problem so one of
my friends helps him finish the job. You know what, I never even heard
the guy say "Thank you" for the help!

More problems Saturday morning. Another friend takes his car for a lap
and hears the CV joins click. He decides to flip them and see if he can
finish the event. He has tools, but no jackstands or the magic 12 point
tool. I loan him mine, and he removes the CV joints in the sand of
Bridgehampton. The grease was completely dry in the inner joints of
both axles. One of the races was pretty beaten up, and both joints
should be thrown away, but with some new grease and the new
orientation, the car ran fine and didn't make any noise.

Still one more problem. Saturday afternoon I am sitting on pit road in
front of all my stuff.  I go to start the car, turn the key, nothing
happens. Crap.  Is my battery dead? I don't think so. Perhaps it's the
starter. Get a push start, then spend the rest of the day parking on an
incline so I can pop the clutch. The cast started a few more times, but
that night it refused to turn over. I check the battery and it's OK.
I'm too tired to get under the car so I figure I'll continue my incline
trick for Sunday.  Get to the track Sunday and tell some friends that I
think my starter is shot. I'm going to call George B on Monday for a
rebuilt. One friend descides to take a look at it. He reaches
underneath and discovers that a wire has come loose. Oh, that makes
sense. By now I'm supposed to be on the track, so I pop the clutch and
drive the session. The run ends, so I decide to jack the side up and
put the wire back on. On pit road I jack the car up, and crawl
underneath.  I put jackstands under the front and rear, but I can't
crawl under the car with the jack and stands in place, so I remove the
front one (dumb, I know).  Kevin Gross comes by and remindes me to put
jackstands under the car. Hint - when you are under a car with a hot
exhaust pipe, and someone talks to you, DON'T lift your head to see
them. You'll burn your forehead on the exhaust pipe. Don't ask me how I
know this. I properly put the car on stands, borrowed a bolt from Kevin
-Thanks again, (I bring tools but no hardware to the track) and bolted
the wire back on.

Driving. 

Oh yeah, I did some driving too. Three days worth, about 300 track
miles.  The car never skipped a beat. It's always smooth and fast.  I
took my older brother for ride on Friday, and my sister in law for a
ride on Sunday. Both were very impressed, and want to get into this
stuff. I warn them that it's very addidctive.

The actual driving was great. There were a lot of people in my group,
but most were the same speed, and people give the passing signal
quickly, so traffic wasn't a problem. I turned my fastest lap time ever
on Sunday morning, a 1:54. There were some real real REAL fast cars
there. One was a stock bodied 993TT. It was modified, I don't know how
much, and lapped in the 1:45 or so range. That's just about the fastest
car I've ever seen. There was another real fast car, done in Martini
colors, that sounded great, and was real fast.

Finally, there was a club racer there who I met in Pocono. Bruce (I
forget his last name) has a 911 that runs in E stock, the same class as
me. He got punted off at Pocono and didn't finish the race. Anyway, he
was faster than me all weekend, and that annoyed me.  No matter how I
drove I just couldn't run with him. He would pass me I would drive real
hard to try to keep up, and he would slowly motor away from me.  With
the 993's moving to D next year (I hope), Bruce is definately going to
be front runner.

I had a number of students on Saturday, including a novice in a new 993
cab. Metro PCA runs an event called a novice day. All safety requirements
are waived - no fire exstinguiser, no roll bar for cabriolets, no helmet
required (we provide loaners), and speeds are limited to 75 or so on the
straights. The novices get a classroom session where the basics of track
driving are explained, two on-track sessions, and they can ride in an
instructors car. I drive the first two laps in his car, and explain the
line and the concepts. What a fantastic car. Too bad I don't have 60K to
get a nice one, it was really a tremendous car. Anyway, this guy made me
nervous. He had to slow for the straight! The car was as stock as could
be, and it had a LOT of power and much more grip than I expected.
Very, very nice.

Sunday was the last day of the year for me, and possibly the last 
day ever at Bridgehampton (the track with nine lives). I drove as 
much as possible, and had a great time. The day ended with me leaving
the track as the sun set.

One final note, two people got married at the track on Sunday Morning!
The track doesn't open for cars until 1:00PM, so they got married at
the start - finish line. Congratulations to Sue and Dale Smith!

I told the track GM that he should put together a special wedding package.
You know, one price gets you the track for the day, and a Justice of
The Peace. For an extra fee, he could provide entertainment, perhaps
a tape of race motors.
