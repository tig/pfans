Nill,

I haven't done any PCA events yet, but have some advice on your choice
of helmet from a vintage racing perspective.

Get a helmet that is rated Snell SA-95.  The SA says that the liner is
either fire proof or fire resistant.  I'm not sure which.  A motorcyle helmet
does not have this rating and is unacceptable in the vintage world.  

The 95 indicates that it was tested to the 1995 standard.  Most
organizations limited the number of years that a helmet can be used.  In
RMVR, a Snell-85 helmet is no longer legal (even if bought in '89).  The
helmet that is a deal but has a Snell-90 rating may be obsolete in 2000.

As to brands, you may find a very limited choice available with the SA
this time of year.  I prefer Shoei helmets from my motorcycling years. 
However, I've been told that they import a fixed number early in the year
(Feb?) and when they run out, so be it.  I was shopping in August under
a time crunch and ended up with a Bell which I don't like as much, but
have gotten used to.
