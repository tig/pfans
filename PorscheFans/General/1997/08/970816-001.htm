Woof!!  I'm a dog owner, and really fond of my 912E.  Not because I 
haven't had or driven other P-cars, which were very nice thank you, but 
because this is what I fancy right now.  I don't know if costs 
(insurance, purchase price, servicing, spares and disaster contingency 
money) are a consideration, but they might usefully inform the decision 
of someone looking at their first P-car.  Perhaps Todd would be better 
advised to try a couple of differing models in his price range?  I 
recall a red 944S that I used to drive kicked some ass, but I drive a 
'doggie' now!!  I also remember a white 924S that was quite 
entertaining, but I don't see that in my drive anymore!!  My '65 912 was 
a lot of fun, and led to the 912E I have at home today.  It's not just a 
choice between 12's and 11's I don't think-  I have several friends who 
did a good job smashing their 911's (cuz they could go real fast...Er, 
until they crashed!)

My advice Todd, look around, don't be in a hurry, look very hard at what 
you can afford to do (because you'll want to do it properly) and if you 
can enjoy the limitations of a 4-cylinder P-car (Woof!), go for it!!  If 
not...there's a bunch of excellent alternative models-  including some 
seriously good early 911's for not a whole bunch more (initial) money.

Good Luck!!  P-fan debate rules!!

R/Dave Lovato

'76 912E
