Hi Wes,

  PCA-Germany Region publishes a newsletter, "Das Blinkin' Blatt" in 
English. Virtually no tech info though, more of what's happening 
within the club type stuff. Nine pages every month, 11 issues a year. 
You can check it out on our website: 
http://platz.com/pca/germany/pcagrhm.html
the current issue of the newsletter is there.

  Benefits to joining us, none really. Cost to join us is $12.00 a 
year, which also gets you the Blatt mailed to wherever you are. ( We 
have a member in Hong Kong I mail a Blatt to!) Of course if you are
in Germany, you may attend any of our events/functions at the
members rate, instead of the non-member rate. 
  As a matter of fact, PCA-GR is going to Alois Ruf's shop in 
Pfaffenhausen on Saturday, the 23rd of August, for a BBQ, Concours 
and a tour of his entire facility, to include various areas such as: 
fabrication, engine, paint, engine/chassis dyno and developmental. 
We'll also see his new CTR other exotic things on his shop 
tour. Cost of this "Open House & Street Concours"  is $5.00 for 
members, and $10.00 for non-members. 

  Anyone out there interested??!!
