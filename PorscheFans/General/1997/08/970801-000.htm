After three years of glorious service to me, and 22 years to the greater 
Porsche world, the Spam Wagen is tired.  Rather than spend the next 
eternity in the garage doing an engine swap, brake upgrade, paint job, 
etc. etc. etc., I've decided to move on up to a 3.2 carrera.

I'm looking for an '87-89 coupe (though I may consider a targa, depending 
on the market), less than ~140K miles, at least some records, and few if 
any luxury options.  Appearance is less important than function, though I 
don't want another anti-concours car (BTDT), and I really want to avoid 
Guard's Red.  Things like leather, heated or electric seats, fancy 
stereos, perfectly preserved interiors, and aftermarket wheels don't 
interest me.  On the other hand, spoilers, sport shocks, and 7&8x15 
Fuchs do interest me.  I'm going to be autocrossing the car, and taking 
it to the track to play--you get the idea.

I've got around $20K to play with, and I don't want to go outside of 
California (ideally I'll find something in the Bay Area).  If you've got 
any leads, let me know.

Thanks,

Dirk Bergstrom   --  '75 911S Brick Shithouse Red "Der Spamwagen"
