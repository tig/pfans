<< Dear Autoweek:
 
 Why are we comparing a car with a tail that looks like a kit car from a
 bad B-Grade sci-fi armageddon movie, a suspension copied, probably
 poorly and 20 years late, from the Porsche 944 or 928, lousy panel fit
 and finish (my observation), and no convertible option, to a sports car
 like the Porsche Boxster?  
 Looking at the road tests over the past year between BWM, Porsche,
 Viper, Ferrari, Corvette, it looks to me like Corvettes are always
 coming in last to the old 911 design.  GM, with all its resources can't
 beat a 50 year old design that stated with what was basically a Beetle,
 and they aren't anywhere near the Boxster in beauty of design or
 handling, only in getting 60 horsepower and 24 mph more more out of a
 much larger engine.  
 Considering the GM experiences with aluminum engines, service, paint
 life, honesty, design flaws and the dealer network, if I want a sports
 car I'll take the Porsche.  If I want a great stereo and a car to take
 down to Indianapolis Raceway Park for the Tuesday drag races I'll buy a
 Firebird Formula with the Corvette engine.

1)  You begin comparing the boxter to the corvette.  (same price, 'vette is
much faster.)
2)  You end up comparing the vette to a 911 ($30k cost difference, about the
same speed, for $68k you can get a 192mph Lingenfelter 'vette)
3)  The drive trane may have the same layout, but the suspension is NOT even
close to the 944/928.
4)  This is the Porsche General information list, not the 'Vette Flamers (no
pun intended) list.
