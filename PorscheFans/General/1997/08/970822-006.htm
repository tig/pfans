I've looked at a 1988 911 sunroof coupe that's been put up for sale.  Second
owner, the car has about 70,000 miles on it.  The car looks good, seems to be
straight.  Owner claims it has never been in an accident.  Has had some very
minor paint work.  I'm trying to track down the original owner to get service
history info. 

What should I be looking for in a 1988 car?  Any common weak points?  Any
costly repairs or replacements that are to be expected with this particular
model year or the 1986 through 1989  normally aspirated 911s?   Also, any
modifications or upgrades that are routinely made?

I'm looking for a car to use frequently, though not daily, on the street and
to drive in PCA and other club "educational" track events.

Your comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail me.
Thanks in advance.

Richard Kessler
