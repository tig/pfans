Hello Im new to this list from Denver.  I have just recently accuired a
86 red 944 Turbo .  It has 111,000 Miles on it but runs very good.  I
have no Idea who the previous owner was on it since I got it from a
dealership.  The wierd thing is That I have two different VIN #'s.  The
VIN# on the passenger Firewall says WPOZZZ95ZGN151319 and the VIN number
on the A-Pillar says WPOAAO95OGN151319.  Can anyone tell me what info is
in my vin #?  My option code is C02, 182, 220, 431,526,533,650,666,900.
I found all the codes except for 182.  Does anyone know what 182 is?  I
know what option code 900 Tourist delivery means? My Engine /
Transmission # is 51 5R- any info ? And does any one know what
production number mine is? Also I have found some new Bosch 3 pronged
Supers.  Does anyone have any experiannce using this plug in their 944?
Would someone be able to tell me where the fuel filter is located at?
And what is the approximate labor time needed to change the rubber
intercooler hose which goes to the turbo?  And would it be better to
change my fuel filter before running a Can of BG44K or should I add the
can first?  And what is the proper weight of the transmission fluid? I
will be changing it out with redline.  Someone told me you have to glue
the rotor on to change it (Distributor) is this true?  My wife and I
will be moving to Germany before the end of the year and will be takking
the car with us so I will probably have many questions to get it ready.
Thanks for everyones help.  Also someone mentioned the lighted rear
PORSCHE Display between the brake lights.  Mine is lit , is this
standard? Also I am able to leave the right or left parking lights  on
when I park the car.  I have seen this on alot of cars in Germany, Do
all Porsches come to America with this feature? Gotta Run-
