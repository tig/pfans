I am just about to Rcv my 911 S4 here in Dubai in the Middle East and
was thinking how to avoid speeding tickets. This may not be a new idea
but I had never heard of it until my mind got to thinking about it. 

You buy yourself a nice handheld GPS  $300 to $400. Learn how to use it
which is fairly simple and then every time you pass a fixed speeding
camera or notorious speed trap place you store it and make it a
waypoint.  Then you set your waypoint alarm to say 500 meters and hey
presto when you approach a known recorded camera you get an alarm and
basically a reminder to boot the brakes. A couple of times in the past I
have forgotten that there is a camera and this acts as a fairly non
intrusive reminder. Mine works fine on the dashboard and I do believe
its legal.

The neat things is that you can share your way points with your buddies.
Maybe even post them on a web page somewhere for every body to down load
before traveling to new territory . Has any body else tried this. !!!!.
You could be saving on Tickets and Insurance.
