Having recently considered the new Corvette - which would have been less 
expensive to purchase than the '95 993 I purchased instead - we do have to 
give some credit to Chevy for producing a pretty darn good car.  However 
neither the cars nor the resale value hold up well over time.   Having 
previously owned a '68 911 and a '74 Vette (purchased after I got tired of 
rust repairs on the 911 and I needed something "cheap")  there is no 
comparison in my mind.    I would not even have looked at the new Vette 
except it does seem to be initially a good value for the money and the 
numbers - which indeed blow off a Boxster (which is part of the reason I did 
not buy one).     On the other hand If you want something real fast and 
don't care about much else 
buy a bike.   

As my biker  brethren say,   "Keep the rubber side down".

Cheers
