Todd, I'd get a 911. The 912 is a dog and does not hold its value as well.
Also on resale not as many people are interested. The body parts are mostly
identical but the mechanical parts are not and therefore not as plentiful. My
experience is that most people want to make their Pcars faster and handle
better. So why start with the slowest Porsche made in the last 32 years? For
the same price or slightly more you could get an identical 911. For what it's
worth the 912 was first introduced in 1965. To lower the price Porsche put in
the old 356 4 cylinder which had only 90 HP whereas the 911 had 130 for the
same year. The 912 was made 1965-69 and reintroduced in 1976 with a VW
engine. 76 was the last year. I'd stay away from the 76. Two books to
consider are Bruce Andersons "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook" and Dean
Batchelor's "Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide". Bruce is a Porsche fans
subscriber and his book is the benchmark for 911s. There is a chapter on
buying 911s which would partly applicable to 912s. Dean's book is a general
overview of all the Porsche lines complete with specs as they changed thru
the years. In the back of both books are biblographies for other
publications. Good Luck
.
