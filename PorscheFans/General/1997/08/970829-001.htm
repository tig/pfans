Hey Dana, sorry about stirring all guff on the Vette issue, but in answer to
your question. Yes police officers have to follow all traffic laws when not
on emergency calls. But there are so many exceptions. Usually the calls we go
on are not life threatening but there is a hurry up offense sort of mind set
that goes in. You may be doing a back up for a fellow officer but in his
voice you hear he wants you there quicker. So you pick up the speed. Most of
us are excellent drivers and can handle the extra MPH. All of our times are
logged and responce time is very important issue with the public. They dont
like to wait for anything. Hope this helps. And my 928 is STILL broken. My
mustangs never did me like this. But I love my Porsche anyway.
