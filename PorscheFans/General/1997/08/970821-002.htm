I brought a 81 924 porsche on the spur of the moment. As evidence of it
being spur of the moment purchase, it was a 924 Porsche as I have been
subsquently told many times "not a real Porsche but an Audi or VW
Porsche." I asked a porsche specialty shop to do a prepurchase
inspection on another porsche when the manager informed me of a porsche
they have inhouse for sale which could outperform the former and offered
a warranty.  I subsquently purchase their 924 with a rebuilt engine,
converted from a fuel injection system to a carb system, italian
(Macconi's), new upgraded exhaust system, etc.  I paid 4K for the car. 
The shop is located in the state of Virginia.  I am a resident of the
state of Maryland.  After at least 3 false start with this car break
down as a result of an electrical shortout of the system, to broken fan
belt which caused a coolent bust, etc. It was not able to pass the state
of Maryland inspection test.  The biggest issue was the state of
Maryland does not allow headers. In order for this vehicle to pass the
manifold/exhasust must be replaced to original specifications.   I had
to take the saler to court to get him to agree to replace the exhaust. I
was successful.  The work is about to begin as the part is coming from
California.
I have heard that I am going to lose significant power a result of the
manifold/exhaust system downgrade?  Give me some feedback.  The interior
of the car is shot where can I find replacement parts as junk yards in
this area don't have much?  Are there any fans of the 924?  I understand
it to be a good solid reliable water cooled engine with very little
problems? Am I mistaken?  An option currently is to keep the car as is
(manifold/exhaust intact) and get it registered, titled and insured in
the state of Virginia.  What do you think?  Another option is to (thru
the civil court) try and make to saler take the car back and get my
money back and buy a "Real Porsche"?  How do I make the best of this
tough situation?  Email if you like NASAUN@EROLS.COM
