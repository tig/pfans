I bought a 930 with 32,000 miles on it about a year ago.  Have some
history of the car; it had only had 3000 miles on it in the previous 5
years.  No oil leaks when parked.  

In the city, (big time start and stop, short trips) it uses a quart
every 400 - 500 miles. On the road, it probably goes up to 700 - 800
miles for a quart.  Car doesn't smoke, other than puff at start up
(occassionally big puff at start up, particularly if parked on a slope)

My mechanic thinks it is valve stems and guides, and suggests a valve
job.  Someone tell me if the following points to something else.  

When I drive, never a touch of burning oil smell, EXCEPT, if I hit the
brakes hard coming to a stop, cockpit is filled with smell of burning
oil, which dissipates withing 30 seconds or so.  However, I can only do
this once.  If I try at the next stop sign, no smell.  I cannot figure
out how, but is there any way the engine (or something else which is not
so hot) is pooling oil on top, but then I am sloshing it onto the
headers or something else hot when I do a very hard stop?  My hope is
that I may have a weird oil leak rather than needing a valve job.  Even
if I do need a valve job, what would cause the burning oil smell at hard
braking?  It does it whether Just warming up or full operating
temperature, and does it whether the oil is at the top of the range or
at the bottom of the range.
