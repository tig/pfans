Dana,

You may not like the new Corvette and it may not fit your criteria for a
sports car, but sending email like this to Autoweek makes you (and
Porsche fans everywhere) look bad.

The suspension was not copied from any Porsche.

A convertible is available.

The car out performs the Boxster and the 911 Carrera and handles about as
well.

I certainly don't think the new Corvette is what I would buy, but I can
appreciate that it is a nice car and not one I would be embarrassed to own
or drive. It is certainly a better car than the Boxster or 911 Carrera
dollar for dollar!

That being said, due to what I look for in a sports car, I would buy a 911
Carrera before I would buy a Boxster or Corvette, regardless of the price
issue.
