Lon and others:

As most of you already know, the stock Fuchs as well as many of the pre-1990
or so Porsche factory wheels, were anodized.  Anodizing is a form of chemical
protection but is not like painting.  The anodizing process forms an aluminum
oxide coating that is very easily ruined by car washes, dogs, abrasives, many
stronger cleaners, etc.  The best way to wash and maintain anodized wheels is
with a product desigend for cleaning them.  Porsche and others make such
products.  Steel wool will destroy the finish.  At this point Lon could get
his rims polished (yuch!), painted, or refinished by one of several reputable
companies who advertise in Panorama and Excellence.

I believe the newer Porsche rims as well as the phone dials and some others
are painted silver and then clear coated.  The painted finish is not as good
looking as the anodized finish, IMHO.
