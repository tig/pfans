Contrary to Powderdude's opinion, there ARE positive reasons to consider a
912.  Yes, the resale price is low, but they aren't dropping.  The 912 has
less low end grunt(the horsepower CAN be enhanced, if you want to), but is
easier to throw around in the twisties, and more forgiving than a 911: over
200#  less weight hanging over the rear axle.  Mechanical parts for the 912
are no problem as far as my experience has been.  Operating costs are less
for a 912:  better gas mileage, cheaper tune-ups, no need for a whole case
of oil for an oil change.  I recently offered my son an exchange for his '68
912 targa, a pristine '73 911T targa I picked up "right", and he decided to
keep his 912.  It's all in what you like.
