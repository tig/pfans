Dear Nathan,

If I were in your situation, I'd cut my losses.  You're talking big
bucks and lots of headaches to correct what's wrong with a car that
you paid too much for to begin with.  I don't know the particulars of
your state, but the red flag in CA would be the carb conversion--a
definite no-no, and putting the fuel injection back in is worse than
reversing a vasectomy.

The limit for small claims in CA is $5000--don't know what it is where
you are, but you have to file in the county where the purchase was
made.  If it's a dealer or a repair shop that sells cars, there's an
implied warranty of fitness for purpose--the one advantage that you
don't have with a private party.  I imagine a judge would be
sympathetic to your case and would find in your favor, and recovering
from a business with, presumably, assets and money coming in would not
be as hard as from an individual.

A used car is a gamble in any circumstance, but one so fraught with
problems is out of the ordinary.  Even selling it off for parts would
be better than throwing good money after bad, but I'd try the small
claims suit first.

Good luck.

Steve Gilbert

P.S.  My barber has a nice 944, '86 (I think), with original red paint
and mileage in the 70s, for which he's asking $6500.  Just for
comparison, and if anyone out there is interested (I get no
benefit--just FYI).
