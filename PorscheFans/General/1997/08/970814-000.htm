MY (capitals, may stand for something, but cute) Porsche (also MY
Audi, MY BMW--different license frame for each marque) is the
successor dealership to Wester Porsche-Audi, whose former owner, Don
Wester, was active in Porsche racing.  I bought my car there 22 years
ago, and when my clutch cable broke at Laguna Seca (most
embarrassing--it was at a 30-year celebration of the 911 in '93) I had
to leave it there.

Lo and behold, the same head Porsche mechanic who gave my car its 1000
mile service was still there.  They service Porsches in a separate
shop within the larger service area, and Pete Sandholdt is definitely
good at what he does.  He calls his own shots over there--family owns
major real estate in the area--and really likes his work.  My guess is
he's still there, and I'd certainly trust my car to him.  Prices
aren't exactly low, but they did detail my car for no extra charge.
(It not only had to be towed from the track, but hoisted out of a
gravel runaway ramp).  My one request, that they clean up my car
before I had to see it again, was filled, and I even volunteered to
pay extra, so they were nice besides.  Taking the Greyhound back there
was a humbling experience.
