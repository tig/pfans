There is a line from one of the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" books
by Douglas Adams.  I think it is from "Restaurant at the End of the
Universe":

Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy is thinking of stealing a
car from a parking garage (well, actually it is a spaceship) when he
spies this really froopy piece...  I don't have the book in front of me,
so this is going to be a "close" translation.

....so I was out cruising in my spaceship one day when one of these
froopy numbers just blazed on past me, star-drive barely ticking over.
A few seconds later it smashed straight into the third moon of
Jaglan-Beta.
Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow...

There cannot be a more apt description on record of what I think of GM
products in general.  Not all GM equipment is junk, I love Saturns,
Firebird Formulas, Cadillacs with the Northstar System, Oldsmobile
Aurora, Buick Riviera, but the latest Corvette is one of the ugliest
Frankenstein's monster of a car I have ever seen.
