     Porschefans, Dana,
     
     
     In New Jersey, there is a 1920s law that explicitly prohibits 
     motorcycle police (and presumably all patrol vehicles) from exceeding 
     the speed limit if not in active pursuit of a violator, or on the way 
     to a crime or emergency scene.
     
     Thus, if a patrol car is cruising at high speed (say 90), in order to 
     discover a speeding driver (say doing 70), that officer is breaking 
     the law in order to discover an infraction (i.e. has no probable 
     cause) and any summons issued as a result of such action should be 
     dismissed.  Of course a cruiser doing the limit, will depend on a 
     speeder passing him/her in order to discover a speeder, not very 
     promising for a marked vehicle.
     
     That said, it is not unusual for police to bend the truth in order to 
     support a citation.  If they know the law, they may say that they were 
     sitting in the weeds when they observed a vehicle pass them at a great 
     rate of speed (probable cause), and they then started their high speed 
     pursuit from a stop [which could last several miles].
     
     Happy Porsching
