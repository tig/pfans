An Interview with Hans Stuck


The following is an interview I did recently with great Porsche
driver, Hans Stuck.

CW: Hans Stuck.  I'm honored simply to be talking to you.  Thank you
    for granting me this interview.

HS: No problem.  I'm always happy to support Auto Week, it's a great
    publication.

CW: Sorry for the confusion, but what I said was that I represent
    Otto Veek.  He's paying for my trip here to interview you.

HS: Auto Week is a person?

CW: No, not Auto Week, Otto Veek.

HS: You are sure?

CW: Anyway, Hans I just wanted to say that I've followed your great
    career for years now, and I'm quite awed by your presence.

HS: Otto Veek.

CW: You have acquired over time the nickname, "The Wetfoot".

HS: Heh heh heh, yes Otto, I have.

CW: This is some kind of fungus?

HS: Fungus?  I don't think so, I seem to drive well in the rain.

CW: Congratulations, but I was talking about your feet.  Why are they
    wet?

HS: No, they are not wet.  I am called that because when the track is
    wet, I drive very fast.

CW: You don't drive fast when the track is dry?

HS: Heh.  Yes, of course I do that as well.  But rain, you see, it is
    called the great equalizer.  "Sauce for the goose".

CW: Whoa whoa whoa.  Slow down here Hans.   Let's stick to one topic.
    We can talk about stereo components and cooking later, right now let's
    get back to this athlete's foot thing.

HS: I think perhaps we have some sort of language problem.

CW: Very well, if it's too personal, we can talk about something
    else.  You had mentioned geese, I didn't realize you were also a
    gourmet.

HS: No no no.  "Sauce for the goose" is an expression.  It means
    making all things equal.  Rain does this, you see?  Horsepower doesn't
    matter as much in the rain.  The car becomes secondary, and the driver
    becomes primary.

CW: I see.  I see.  Amazing.  

HS: So you understand?

CW: Of course.  Completely.  And this helps with the sauce, I
    assume.  Interesting.

HS: What?

CW: My next question regards another of your nicknames, "Stuckie".

HS: Yes.  I suppose that's what you would call a term of endearment.

CW: I assume this derives from your lankiness.

HS: No, I believe it derives from my name.

CW: How do you get "Stuckie" from "Wetfoot"?

HS: No, Hans Stuck.

CW: That's what I mean.

HS: Huh????

CW: I will never forget, of course, that immortal picture of you, a
    year or two ago, sideways in a 911 turbo wiping the fog off the
    windshield with one hand and driving with the other.

HS: Ah yes, that was pretty impressive photography, don't you think?

CW: Pretty impressive driving as well.

HS: Thank you.

CW: I imagine your hand got a little wet, too, wiping off the
    windshield that way.

HS: Errr...perhaps...I do not remember that part...

CW: Yet you are not called "The wethand"?

HS: Are you nearly finished with your questions, I am beginning to get
    a little headache.

CW: Or "the wethead"!  Why don't they call you that?  

HS: Please, let us talk about racing. 

CW: Right.  Racing.  Hans, or should I call you "wet"?

HS: ....Hans, please.

CW: Sure.  Hans, you drove recently at Glen Mans.

HS: Excuse me?  Do you speak English?  Or German?

CW: Ah yes, you probably know it as "LE" Mans.

HS: Le Mans? Oh, OK.  I drove the Porsche GT-1 works entry with
    Boutsen and Wollek.  It was a very exciting race.  Le Mans is the most
    thrilling, exhausting, wonderful, and exasperating experience in my
    life.  This year we were in first place for much of the race.  The
    Mobil One Warsteiner team really pulled together and did a great...

CW: Cut the bull, Stucky.  You lost.

HS: Of course, that is Le Mans.  It can reward you or it can...

CW: This ain't no ESPN interview, Hans.  I want the real truth.
    Weren't you pissed?

HS: Pissed?  No, I was of course disappointed, but ...

CW: Well I was pissed!  You guys had your eyes on the prize!

HS: It is no used crying over spilt...

CW: But that moron Wollek put the car up on the curb!

HS: It could have happened to anyone you know, that is racing.

CW: Come one Hansy.  If you had been driving the car, would you have
    tried to pass that McLaren at such an inopportune time?

HS: Well....perhaps if it was raining.

CW: It wasn't raining.  You guys were in the lead, and then suddenly
    Wollek breaks a half-shaft and the whole thing is over! All that work!
    All that effort!  FOR NOTHING!

HS: OK!  I admit it!  I almost killed him!!!!  Why couldn't I have
    been driving!!!  We could have won Le Mans!!!!!  That dumkopf!!!!!!!!!

CW: Hey, calm down there Stucko.

HS: But you make me very....

CW: There's no need to get all worked up over it.  You don't want
    people to start calling you "The Wetcheek" or "The Wet Blanket"?

HS: You won't print what I said, will you?

CW: Of course not....how do you spell dumkopf?

HS: I believe this interview is over.

CW: OK, just one more question Hansel.  You've been racing cars, some
    Audis and others but mainly Porsches, and mainly 911s, for many many
    years.

HS: Yes.

CW: You are one of the best known drivers in road racing.

HS: Well, many people know me, yes.

CW: And with all the success you have had, you have never driven in
    Formula 1.

HS: I am too tall for Formula 1 cars.

CW: Too tall?  Give me a break, did you see the job Williams did on
    that Renault to fit Mansel in a few years ago?

HS: I don't remember the ...

CW: They added like two feet to the cockpit so Nigel could get his
    big fat lazy butt into it.  You telling me they couldn't do that for
    you?

HS: My butt is not that big.

CW: Hmmmm....true.  So much for that idea.  Well, Hans, it has been a
    pleasure and an honor to talk to you here today.

HS: I wish I could say the same.

CW: The next time you're in town, look me up and we'll have a beer and
    talk over old times.

HS: What "old times" are you talking about?

CW: This time, right now.  We can talk about it!  So long for now,
    and good luck with that racing career thing.
