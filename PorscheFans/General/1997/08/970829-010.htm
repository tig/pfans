Well I am still hopping mad (or at least still sighing, sigh...) over the 
story in the San Jose Mercury News a while back.

A subscriber wrote to the weekly column, Road Show (driving-related stuff) 
about seeing a CA Highway Patrol car in the carpool lane (min. 2 people, 
min. $287 fine if caught) during rush hours with only ONE cop in the car. 
 The writer even noted that the emergency lights weren't on, the officer 
wasn't in a hurry, and he asked whether cops had to obey traffic laws if 
they were not responding to emergencies.

The columnist, Mr. Road Show, posed this question to the local office of 
the CHP, and this was the response (from a CHP sergeant):  "The officer was 
most likely following a traffic violator in one of the other lanes, and he 
had to drive in the carpool lane in order to gather evidence.  This 
constitute an emergency, and even though he was not in a hurry or driving 
with lights and siren, he is allowed to disobey traffic laws, including the 
carpool law."

GET THAT!!!  In my opinion when the sergeant is *speculating* on the 
justifications for the officer breaking the law, and sounding righteous 
about it, he is clearly abusing his authority.

The sergeant could have added, for example, a humble statement like "if the 
squad car number was known and if the officer in question was not gathering 
evidence then he will be reprimanded" or something similar.  After all, 
aren't these public SERVANTS and not high gods of the highway?

I forget the Latin phrase for "Who will watch the watchers?"

I you might guess, this has been challenged in the past.  Case law here
in the People's Republic of California recognizes the need for speed
(heh heh) in order for an officer to do her/his job.  A former
profession I sometimes, but not often, miss.
