Powderdude and Others Who Doubt the 912:

Whoa!  Hold On Thar!  Bad-mouthing 912s is dangerous around me, and no doubt
around a few other experienced owners.  Having bought mine in 1968, driven it
at least 150,000 miles, restored it twice, and time trialed and autocrossed
it from day one, I can assure you it's no dog.

Sure, it has the "old" 356 engine, but before you condemn that, try driving
one on a track or at an autocross!  I guarantee you that on a track without
looong straights or in an autocross, I can beat a good number of the 911s
present.  Why?  Because it weighs just 2,030 lb with half a tank of gas.
 Because it's better balanced.  Because it has shorter gears.  OK, my car has
22 and 28 mm torsion bars, 911S brakes,  and 7-inch mags with 205/50 Comp
TA's, but the engine is just a 1,720-cc otherwise stock unit.  Come to the
'98 Parade and see it.

The 912 is a great "entry-level" Porsche--simple to maintain, easy to buy,
fun to drive.  Learning to drive in a low-ppowered car can help a lot when
you move to a 911 (notice that I didn't say "step up").  Try one and see!
