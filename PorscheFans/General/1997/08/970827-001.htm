I just read the comparison of the Corvette and Boxter. And although I am a
Ford fan I have to admit that the Vette would kick the tail off  of the
Boxter. I agree that the Boxter is a nice car but the Vette is also a proven
winner, even though it has a front end like a Mazda. Which is also a very
serious car and would also kick the tail off of a Boxter without thinking
twice about it. So I hope I did not do anything against Porsche law, but
facts are facts. I am the proud owner of a beuatiful black 928 that I have
not been able to drive for 6 weeks, but that in no way influenced my writing.
Till later Porsche fans, SAL.
