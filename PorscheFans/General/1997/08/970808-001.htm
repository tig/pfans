I've had the same problem going from the excellent pedal setup of Japanese 
sports cars (300ZX TT, Supra TT) to my 993, and to compensate I've used the 
Third Foot pedal advertised in Excellence with good result.

I tried both the Standard and Extra Wide versions and found the additional 
"lip" on the XW to help in heel-and-toe, at least in the side-to-side 
rolling motion that I use.  The bottom left extension on the Third Foot 
pedals (both versions) has caused me to slightly rev the engine under hard 
braking, but so far this has not caused any performance problem (guess the 
brake is better than the engine!)  I've been thinking about getting this 
left extension sawed off just to make sure.

HTH,
Bob

I've gotten back to a 911 after too many years driving a Japanese 
sportscar.
 However I had forgotten the problem that I used to have in my '68 911 in
trying to heel and toe.   I've seen the larger plates offered in Excellence 
but they look potentially problematic since there is some possibility that
you might hit the throttle when you intend on hitting the brake.

I love my 993 except for this one foible.   Does anyone have any solution?

Thanks.
