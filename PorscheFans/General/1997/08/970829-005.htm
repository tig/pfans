     Pfans,
     
     A couple of months ago I read an Excellence article that was an 
     interview with a Highway Patrol officer (I believe California).  Among 
     other things in the article, he said he appreciated the rare motorist 
     he pulls over who honestly answers the obligatory: "Do you know why I 
     stopped you?"  (BTW "No" is not considered an honest answer.)
     
     Having a poor (but never license threatening) history of being stopped 
     for speeding, I decided to try a new approach the last two times I was 
     stopped.  I answered that I thought I was being stopped for excessive 
     speed, and responded with a bit of surprise when informed just how 
     fast I was going.  The first time I tried this  approach I received a 
     citation for not wearing a seat belt (low cost, no points, no 
     insurance impact) and a written warning for obstructing traffic 
     instead of a ticket for doing 74 in a 55.  The second time (57 in a 
     40) I received a verbal warning.
     
     Now your attorney (also NMA and RADAR) will tell you to admit nothing 
     to the officer, and say as little as possible.  This is true if you 
     actually receive the citation and intend to fight it by yourself.  
     (Your lawyer will often rely on some personal relationship of his to 
     improve your outcome).  However, if being truthful can improve your 
     chances to avoid the citation to begin with, I think you're better 
     off?  Besides, you can always say that you believed you were being 
     stopped for excessive speed, when in fact you weren't speeding (you 
     saw the big truck going fast in the opposite direction, and that's 
     what the radar unit must have picked up).
     
     On the other hand, the time before that, I said I didn't know why I 
     was being stopped & just got a warning.  The time before that when I 
     said I didn't know why and I got a speeding citation (from the kind of 
     authoritarian expulsive orifice that would have given me a citation no 
     matter what.
     
     Anyway, that's my experience, FWIW -- hope it helps some of you dodge 
     some bullets.
     
     --Bob
