<Robert.S.Didner@MARSHMC.COM> so eloquently stated:

I have been pulled over a few times, yet I have never gotten a ticket in
my life (statistically i'm gonna get one soon though:) I'm in the
military, so i had plenty of training at the air force academy in acting
subordinate to somebody and calling them "sir" - and that's what i always
do when pulled over.  By being very courteous and not acting upset helps =
a
great deal - i also admit that i was probably speeding, but that i wasn't
paying attention to how fast I was going and that I really should have
been more careful about it.  So far that has worked wonders and is
probably much better than a person who is rude or evasive to the officer.
Also, for those in the military I think it helps to give them your
military i.d. when you give them your license - i was doing 75 in a 55 =
and
got pulled over, gave him my id, and he asked me if i was on leave, if i
was enjoying it, where i was based, etc.  Many policemen are ex-military
so there may be some connection there.  Anyway, good luck to anybody who
gets pulled over!
