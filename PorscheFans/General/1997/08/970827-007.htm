We are such SNOBS!!!!

This discussion reminds me of one the intelligence community yakked about
way back when a Soviet pilot defected with a Foxbat fighter (MIG 25??).   The
NATO teckies took a hard look at the machine and pronounced it primitive and
inelegant and generally bad-mouthed it.    

It was a full mach number faster than ANYthing we had (or have) in the
inventory.

Any way you cut it, a Vette generates some fine numbers.
