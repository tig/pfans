Thank you!

Earlier, I sent this to Todd. Since there seems to be some more interest,
I'm posting it here:

I actually remembered to look in some of my books for the tire information.
I found three books that addressed the subject of slip vs grip for both street
and track tires.

From page 55 of "Sports Car and Competition Driving" by Paul Frere:
"With narrow road tires, the transistion is rather progressive and quickly
increasing slip angles give the driver a fair warning that the limit is
near and slide is going to take over from slip. The transition is much more
abrupt with high performance tires,  which tend to hang on, generating
comparatively small slip angles until the limit is reached, and slide
takes over with little warning, calling for quick reaction from the
driver."

From page 38 of "Winning A Race Driver's Handbook" by George Anderson:
Breakaway:
   "Street tires break away more gently than do race tires. This 
means the the edge is sharper on race tires; street tires
are more forgiving, more tolerant of mistakes."
   "The slower breakaway characteristics of street tires make them
an excellent choice for driving schools. Students can explost the 
limits of adhesion more completely, with less downside risk."

Page 39 contains a nice graph of lateral force vs. slip angle for
race and street tires. I would be happy to fax it to you.

Finally, on page 23 of "Performance Handling" by Don Alexander,
there is another graph of slip vs grip. This chart compares the
grip of high performance street radials and racing tires. This graph
isn't as clear as the one from "Winning..." but shows the same thing.

That's all I have. Since most of this is subjective, we could go on
forever. One problem that we might be having is that an R1 is not a 
true "racing tire" as referenced by the authors. That will narrow the
gap between a real good street tire and the R1 type tires.
