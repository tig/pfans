The water looks nice, so I thought I would jump in.

There seems to be two discussions going on here:
1) Best tire for novice drivers
2) Rain traction

I'll keep the two subjects seperate.  It's nice to see we can have a
"spirited discussion" without having to trash the authors.

Novice Drivers:

I am in favor of novice or beginning drivers using good street tires for
their first few track event.  Because the street compound tires do not
have the grip of a race tire, you have to be more precise and smooth to go
fast  The student needs to spend more time learning the line and the
smooth application of brake and throttle.  There is also a safety factor.
Since speeds are down, an agriculture experience should not be as severe.

As an example, when I first got my 911 track car, it already had 008rs
tires.  I had been driving an Eagle Talon for several years, as well as
completeing two SCCA driver schools.  So I thought, I'll keep these tires
on and be ready to go.  I did pretty well, but not as fast as I was in the
Eagle.  After awhile I got another set of wheels so I would have a set for
track tires and street tires Since this car is not an everyday driver, I
got a pretty cheap set of street tires.  After driving on these tires for
awhile and feeling how the car would slide in a corner, I got a better
understanding of how this car should feel at the limit.  When I got back
to the track with the race tires, I was immediatly quicker.  If a student
driver can get this feeling at slower, safer speeds then when they make
the transition to race tires, they will be comfortable when the car starts
to slide at the higher corning speeds. 

Part of this question also delt with traction falling off when you have
gone past the limit.  What I have seen is that the different tires have
different characteristics.  The Yokohamma's seem to fall off more
gradually then the R1's.  But the R1's will maintain their traction better
until the line has been crossed.  Other than slicks, these are the only
race tires I have driven.

Wet weather traction.

Living in Florida, this is a near and dear subject.  The R1's work well
wet or dry, as long as there are NO PUDDLES.  I had a set of the new A032
at the PCA race in Sebring and they were fantastic in the rain.  I wish
they were that good in the dry.  The softer compound in race tires does
help with wet conditions.  In heavy rain, a street tire will outperform a
race tire.  For cars that run slicks, the compound on rain tires is very
soft compared to the dry tires.  We only need to use the rain tires if it
is raining hard and causing puddles on the track.  Otherwise we leave the
slicks on and adjust as necessary. 


I think this will be a good debate, as long as we respect each others
opion.
