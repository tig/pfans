Hey Barry and Todd,

First let me start by saying this is a great topic and both of your opinions
are ones that I highly respect.  I've followed Todd over the from RX-7 list
where he used to give great advice and Barry as everyone knows has immense
knowledge too.

I'm not going to address each person's comments as that is the easiest way
to start a flame war.  Instead, I'll give some of the results we had for
a tire test a while back.  I was the lucky person who was chosen for a
Pirelli tire test.  We got to try all of the new sticky tires (including
the Hoosier A3S02) and all of the latest gen street rubber.  Pirelli
does this every year (this year, either I was not invited or it didn't
happen).  I am no longer sponsored by the local Pirelli dealer so that may
explain why I did not get the chance this year.

Basically, we used a g'analyst to determine the actual forces generated.
The car used was my race Talon.  The car was consistent from run to run
and controls were used at the beginning and end of each tire sessions.

What Barry says pretty much plays out true from the data gathered.  But, there
are exceptions.  When the race tire would reach it's peak (usually around
1.2g), it would drop g's very, very quickly.  When using the traction circle
on the g'anaylst, you'd see the line come in from the outeredge dramatically.
The worst tire for this was the Hoosier which broke away very suddenly,
next was the R1 and then the Yokey which was more progressive than some
street tires!  Of the street tires, the Dunlop SP8000 most closely resembled
a race tire in break away.  Once sliding, they would make the car really lose
grip and fly all over the place.  The head tester was running a RWD modified
BMW and the SP8000 would send him into wild spins when they broke loose.
He was a bit of an exuberant (sp?) driver though.  Of the street tires,
the most racy to everyone's surprise was the AVS Intermediate, but that wasn't
from overall grip (that went to the S-02), but rather the response and what
felt like stiff sidewalls.  The Pirelli's did quite well, but were outdone
by the S-02 and even the Dunlop's, much to the shop's dissapoinment at the
test.  The shop did feel that if it were wet, the Pirelli would have done
much better.

As for rain driving, the general consensus among race drivers is that the
race tire is still faster than a street tire as long as there is no standing
water deep enough to make the car hydroplane.

Just a bizarre note, Hans Stuck wrote an article once or was interviewed in
an article I have where they were doing testing on a 993, selecting compounds,
etc.  He stated that when driven around the skidpad, the 993 on street tires
was faster with the tail end hanging out all the way around the skidpad (much
to his surprise) and the race tire equipped car was faster with a bit of
understeer and no tail out sliding at all.  Make what you want of that, just
thought I'd throw that in.

If you want the exact "g" results of the tire test, I'd be happy to post them
as long as it doesn't start a huge "my tire is better than your numbers say"
flame war.  We did this testing for three years straight.  The last year
I did it was the first time the PZero did not eclipse the other tires.

Farzaan.
