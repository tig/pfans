I have to agree with Barry.  Check out the books "How to Make Your Car
Handle" or maybe it was in "Porsche High Performance Driving" or
something
like that but anyway there is a graph comparing Track Vs Street tires
which
shows just the opposite of what Todd was saying.  Track tires have a
much
steeper slop in the region between traction and slipping.  True, track
tires have 
more ultimate grip than street tires but the street tires should have a
more gradual
brake away.
