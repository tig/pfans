This is not the way MY street tires have behaved. Before I moved to
competition tires (BFG R1, Yoko A008RS, Eagle GS CS) I used street
rubber that came on the car (BFG Comp T/A VR, Dunlop D40 M2, Dunlop
SP8000).

I found the street tires were much easier to drive at the limit than
the track tires. The street tires provided much more feedback (via
squealing, rolling onto sidewalls, etc.) that they were about to let
go, and the transition from stick to slide was much more gentle and
easy to control than the competition tires. With R1's, there is not a
lot of difference between stick and slide. IMHO, a novice would have a
very difficult time learning where that line was, and would cross it
too many times. In fact, only a fool could get in trouble with the
D40 M2's. Those things squeal so loud at the limit that you would
probably deafen yourself before you ran out of track.

I have not found this to be true of the competition tires I've
driven on. IMHO, the transition from grip to slip is relatively
sudden, and the grip also falls off fairly quickly.

It seems we have some disagreement here. I am very interested in
what others have to say on this. Is there anyone out there who has
recently switched from street to track tires are would care to 
comment? It's been a few years since I've been on street tires.

I'm not surprised that they are glad they did. However, I think those
drivers would have been better served by spending the money on more
track TIME instead of track goodies. Once again, the best way to
improve your on track performance to get out on the track and drive.
Instead of buying a [chip, camber brace, special brake pads, stiff
swaybars, etc.] get more seat time  and learn to drive the car you
have. Once you have mastered that, then you can add goodies and move
up. Of course, this advice does not apply to safety equipment like roll
bars and harnesses. Can't have too much of that.

Me too. Only I think you have posted the confusing information! I completely 
agree with Dodge.

IMHO, full tread depth R1's are GREAT in the rain. It's because the tread
is soft and will come up to temperature even on a wet track. As Dodge stated,
they don't work AT ALL in standing water, so if the track puddles, watch out.
However, if the track is wet, a car on full tread R1's will be faster than
a car on full tread street tires. 

When I bought my first set of R1's I went to Lime Rock for a Time Trial. The
practice sessions were dry, then it poured for the TT. On the way home [I don't
have a trailer, so I was driving home in the car, with the R1's on] I
was paranoid about driving in the rain on R1's. To my great surprise, I have
never had a tire that handled as well in the rain. Unless I went through a 
puddle, the tire gripped and gripped and gripped.
