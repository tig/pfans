I just got back from a drivers ed event with the Mazda club
at Mid-Ohio, it was awesome!!!!!  This was my first ever track
event and man did I love it.  I learned a ton, never knew how
hard it was to drive properly on a track.  Learn the line, braking
points, where to turn to hit the apex's, ect...  Mid-Ohio is a 
very nice road course and I am really pumped to do this again
soon! 

My instructor had a 1996 993 Turbo Black that was lowered
with chrome rims and an RS 3.8 aftermarket wing.  Very nice
car, plus he added the Autothority kit although it was not working
and has not worked yet???  This guy could drive, he took me out a
couple times in his car, WOW!!!  

I also met Peter Farrell (sp)
who has raced RX 7's professionally and also sells aftermarket
parts.  He took me for a ride in his race prepped RX 7 what a rush,
probably the most fun I have ever had in a car.  He really knows
how to drive, he then took me in my car on the track.  Let me tell
you the driver makes all the difference in the world.  

Peter Cunningham with the RealTime Racing NSX was also there
and was real eager to help out!  I had a blast and can't wait to get
on the track again!!!!!

Buddy 

ps:  I spun my car three times!  Woops!
