The codes are placed by the tire manufacturer on Porsche approved specific=
 tire models and sizes. The March 97 issue of Christophorus (#265) has an=
 article on page 36 describing Porsches testing program and listing approved=
 summer tires for 1997 for Boxster and 911 models. I'll quote extensively:

"...] tires are an important design element, particularly for=
 high-performance sports cars where their properties are co-determinant for=
 the character and handling. This demonstrates one basic reason for the=
 extensive tire tests at Porsche. They are the only way to permit approval=
 of products whose properties are suitably vehicle-specific. [...]=20

Only tires identified on their sidewalls as Porsche tires (N0 to N3)=
 absolutely guarantee original equipment quality under aftermarket sales=
 conditions. In addition, there is no legal definition for a high speed=
 tire(apart from measurements with tolerances and speed categories) and=
 certainly not for handling. Marque ties for Porsche deliver other=
 advantages as well. For all wheel drive models, for instance, dimension=
 constancy in tires is exceptionally important so that larger revolution=
 differences cannot appear in the course of time between front and rear=
 axles, since these can overload the drive system."=20

The Christo article lists Bridgestone Expedia S-01 and S-02, Continental=
 Sport Contact, Dunlop SP 8000, Michelin MXX3 Pilox SX, Pirelli Pzero Asimm,=
 and Toyo Proxes F1as approved summer tire makes for Boxster and 911 series,=
 but distinguishes specific tires for each Porsche model and rim size.

Putting Porsche approvals aside for a bit, personally I'm using the SP8000s=
 and am very happy, and have used and love the S-02 (but they're not in the=
 right size for my C4). Others have suggested using BFG R1 tires during the=
 summer for road and track. They're certainly sticky and work OK in moist,=
 not wet, conditions. Comfort may be a factor and, of course, YMMV <g>.=20

I don't know the "meaning" of N0 .vs. N1 .vs. N2 but the table in Christo=
 for 17" rims on 911 series suggests:=20
N1 - Bridgestone Expedia S-01=20
N1 - Continental SportContact
N0 - Dunlop SP 8000
N0 - Michelin MXX3 Pilox SX
N2 - Pirelli Pzero Asimm
N0 - Toyo Proxes F1
The N2/Bridgestone S-02 and the N1/Michelin MXX3s marked tires are approved=
 for the Boxster on 17" rims .=20
