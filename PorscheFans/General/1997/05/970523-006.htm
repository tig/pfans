Hey dudes,

I managed to dig out as much info as I could from that tire test.  I
can't find any of the subjective comments we had though :(  It's too
bad because I feel that's more important than the objective numbers
below.  If I find them on my home email system, I'll post them, but for
now, you'll have to do with the numbers only:

>All G-figures measured with a g'analyst made by Valentine.  This unit

>Pirelli PZero           1.05g
>Dunlop SP8000           1.01g
>Pirelli P700Z           0.98g
>Yokohama AVS-II         0.95g
>Potenza S-02            1.03g
>Potenza RE71            0.92g
>Goodyear GT+4           0.90g  (not bad for an OEM tire eh?)
>Goodyear ZR50           0.91g
>Pirelli P210 Snow       0.80g
>
>Yokohama A008RS-II      1.12g
>Hoosier Radial          1.29g
>BFG R-1 230 compound    1.22g

Hmmm... I recall the PZero being beat by the S-02 and the SP8000.  I guess
in the subjective portion the SP8000 and S-02 outweighed the grip of the
PZero in the objective tests to take the first two spots away from the
PZero.  After the test, I immediately bought a set of Dunlop SP8000's
for the Talon and I recently re-purchased them for my Porsche and I think
I'm going to go for another set when these wear out.  Paul has the S-02's
on his car and don't seem to be as sharp as I'd like (our alignment is
identical) althought they are faster around bends.

I wish I had the subjective stuff here because it had details on how each
tire reacted to changes in camber, etc.  I should tell you what kind of
car it was on.  We ran a 1992 Talon AWD with a beefed up motor (~300hp).
The car had a custom made RalliArt suspension with really stiff springs
and stiff shocks.  The car was lowered 4".  Front camber was set at -3.0
and the rear at -4.0.  Bushings were all polyurethane.  Wheels were 16x8 and
tire size was 245/45R16.  The only case where they were 225/50 was the
snow tire (which we threw in just for fun).  The other car used in the test
was a BMW 635 (ci or something like that).  I wasn't in that area so I don't
have the figures for it, but I do remember that the P700Z and S-02 were
faster than the PZero on that car (less camber, less ideal camber curves).
I also remember that the GT+4 did not come even close to the g's it did on
the Talon (could be the AWD masking the tires inabilities).  The AWD platform
made it easy to get consistent numbers, whereas the BMW dude kept spinning
out all the time.

If you have a problem with the above numbers, I'll gladly pass your comment on
to the g'analyst :)

Farzaan.
