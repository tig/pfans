I recently purchased a 911 turbo that turned out to be a lemon. I have talked
to many 
members from the fan club about my problem. They were very helpful.
Unfortunately
Porsche Cars North America lied again (John Crowe and Pat Hogan). They
offered to buy the car back through the BBB autoline. The next day  they
declined to honor the offer because I would not sign my legal rights away as
a citizen. When you file charges with  the BBB you can only address
manufacturers defects. Porsche was aware of this fact and so was I. Why did
they ask me to sign a document that addressed issues with the dealership,
personal issues, the tow truck problem? I will
not allow this organization to bully me. If any of you have problems with
your car and have to go through the BBB be aware this Porsche Cars North
America does not care about your problems or concerns. The BBB also told them
they could not make me sign the document. You can also talk to Ann at the BBB
at 1800-955-5100 ext. 513. I gave her permission to release info.. One day
you could be in my position. I hope not.

Now I have sue Porsche for breach of contract. The car is leaking oil in my
drive way
and I have to go back to the hearing June 1, 1997. If you would like to hear
John Crowe side of the story call him at 702-348-3080. Remember, he speaks
with fork 
tongue.I have documentation. I am not bitter I am appauled.
