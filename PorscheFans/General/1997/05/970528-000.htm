On the local radio (BBC Radio Cambridgeshire) news this morning, they said
that Benetton were planning to withdraw from F1 due to the high cost
involved, and that Porsche, Audi and BMW were interested in buying the
team.

I have seen at least one post on the F1 newsgroup which claimed that
Benetton had refuted this, so don't take it as gospel.

While I would *love* to have a Porsche to cheer for at F1 races
(especially if Schumi, M was driving it), I fear that their previous
disastrous forays into this arena don't bode too well, and that Porsche
would be better off concentrating on areas in which racing versions of
their road cars can compete ...

And on the subject, is anyone else going to Le Mans this year?
