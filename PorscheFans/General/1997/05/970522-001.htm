     On 5/22/97, responding to my comments on R1's and the advisability of 
     novices learning on them, Barry Lenoble wrote:
     
This is not the way MY street tires have behaved. Before I moved to 
competition tires (BFG R1, Yoko A008RS, Eagle GS CS) I used street 
rubber that came on the car (BFG Comp T/A VR, Dunlop D40 M2, Dunlop 
SP8000).
     
I found the street tires were much easier to drive at the limit than 
the track tires. The street tires provided much more feedback (via 
squealing, rolling onto sidewalls, etc.) that they were about to let 
go, and the transition from stick to slide was much more gentle and 
easy to control than the competition tires. With R1's, there is not a 
lot of difference between stick and slide. IMHO, a novice would have a 
very difficult time learning where that line was, and would cross it 
too many times. In fact, only a fool could get in trouble with the
D40 M2's. Those things squeal so loud at the limit that you would 
probably deafen yourself before you ran out of track.

     Barry:
     
     I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.  I've driven on various 
     R rated tires and street tires for the last 11 years, and my 
     experience is completely the opposite of what you describe.  No one 
     should judge the limit of traction by the squeal of the tires.  The 
     only appropriate gauge is (non-audio) feedback from the car.  Many 
     tires start squealing and have a traction left - that's just their 
     particular characteristic behavior.  As for R1's just gripping and 
     then quickly slipping, I'm really at a loss to understand your 
     experience, because I drive mine on the track through a large "zone" 
     of traction loss, sometimes semi-sideways just for fun.  Yokohama 
     008RS's, the tires I used to drive on, were the same way.

I have not found this to be true of the competition tires I've 
driven on. IMHO, the transition from grip to slip is relatively 
sudden, and the grip also falls off fairly quickly.
     
It seems we have some disagreement here. I am very interested in 
what others have to say on this. Is there anyone out there who has 
recently switched from street to track tires are would care to 
comment? It's been a few years since I've been on street tires.
     __________________________________________________________
     Obviously, we have definite disagreement, but at least we can express 
     our opinions without devolving into a flame war (although your 
     comments below are a little aggressive, but that's ok - I can handle 
     it).  I too would be interested in what others have to say.

I'm not surprised that they are glad they did. However, I think those 
drivers would have been better served by spending the money on more 
track TIME instead of track goodies. Once again, the best way to 
improve your on track performance to get out on the track and drive. 
Instead of buying a [chip, camber brace, special brake pads, stiff 
swaybars, etc.] get more seat time  and learn to drive the car you 
have. Once you have mastered that, then you can add goodies and move 
up. Of course, this advice does not apply to safety equipment like roll 
bars and harnesses. Can't have too much of that.
     _____________________________________________________________
     Your comment assumes that my participants got R rated tires to the 
     exclusion of going to other events and getting more track time, which 
     is not the case.  The simply enjoy their track time more on R1's, in 
     part because they go faster and in part because it makes it easier for 
     them to learn (their comments, not mine, in this case).
     
     
Me too. Only I think you have posted the confusing information! I completely 
agree with Dodge.
     
IMHO, full tread depth R1's are GREAT in the rain. It's because the tread
is soft and will come up to temperature even on a wet track. As Dodge stated, 
they don't work AT ALL in standing water, so if the track puddles, watch out. 
However, if the track is wet, a car on full tread R1's will be faster than
a car on full tread street tires. 
     ______________________________________________________________
     Once again, we disagree.  While R1's are better than slicks in the 
     rain, they aren't great in the rain compared to a full treaded, well 
     designed street tire, for a couple of reasons.  One is that they only 
     have tread pattern on 2/3 of the tire - not great for displacing 
     water.  Second, even full tread R1's have less tread depth than your 
     average full tread street tire.  Further, your comment about the soft 
     compound enabling the R1's to come up to temperature easier in the 
     rain is mystifying.  Yokohama A008 RS's are also a soft compound R 
     rated tire, and they don't come up to temps nearly as quickly as R1's 
     on a dry track.  Street tires, on the other hand, are designed to work 
     at lower temps, which is why they "come up to temp" faster on a dry or 
     wet track.  That's why street tires are "safer" for the novice on the 
     street, because he/she need be less concerned about them sticking 
     through the first couple of turns on the Angeles Crest Highway (or 
     other twisty road). 
     
     
     
When I bought my first set of R1's I went to Lime Rock for a Time Trial. The 
practice sessions were dry, then it poured for the TT. On the way home [I don't 
have a trailer, so I was driving home in the car, with the R1's on] I
was paranoid about driving in the rain on R1's. To my great surprise, I have 
never had a tire that handled as well in the rain. Unless I went through a 
puddle, the tire gripped and gripped and gripped.  
     
     
Any other comments?
