I travel to Stuttart, Germany often with my work.  To rent a 911/Boxster
contact Avis at an airport, such as Stuttgart in advance.  Rates for the
911 are DM250 per day, with a 500 free kilometer limit.  If you try to rent
at a rental agency in the city such as Roesch in Reutlingen, a 911 costs
DM1000+!!!.  Go to the airport in advance!!!!!  To visit the Porsche Museum
it is open seven days a week 9-12 and 1300-1600.  To tour the factory, you
must reserve in advance with Frau Ina Schlegel at Porsche AG.  Her address
is Frau Ina Schlegel, Offentlichkeitarbeit, Porsche AG, Porschestrasse 42,
7000 Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.  You can call her, She speaks excellent
English at +49 711 8275384.  This must be done in advance!!!!  If you're in
Southern Germany don't miss it, you regret it.  Also you can visit the Taxi
Manufacturer's museum at Mercedes-Benz too.  That is also excellent and
covers a widerange of great Mercedes race cars, etc.  Sorry I don't have
the address, but they're in Unterturkheim and are near the Daimler Benz
Stadion.  Dont miss it, it is free, but is closed Sundays and Mondays.
Have fun.  and leave your wallet at home unless you want to bankrupt
yourself with goodies.
