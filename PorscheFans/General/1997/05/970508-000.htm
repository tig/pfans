I dropped my '97 C4S at the dealer yesterday to fix two problems:
squealing fan belt, and 'groaning' windshield/dash.  

The first problem has been discussed on the list, and the service rep I
talked with indicated that Porsche has asked the dealers to tension the
belts as part of the pre-delivery prep.  That hadn't been done for my
car (picked up in CA, driven to WA).

The second problem was mentioned briefly in a post a few weeks/months
ago.  The problem is characterized by a groaning/creaking sound coming
from the dash at slow speeds.  The earlier post indicated that 'all 993s
do this'.  Well, mine doesn't any longer.  Apparently in the original
design, at the point where the windshield seal and the dash meet there
was metal to rubber contact.  The 'new' design puts a felt gasket on the
metal to prevent the noise as the body flexes.  When the 'new' design
was implemented wasn't clear, hopefully it's being done at the factory
now instead of at the dealer.

On a side note, I checked out a copy of "Lean Thinking" by J. Womak and
D. Jones, mostly for the chapter on the rebirth of Porsche.  Very
interesting reading--I highly recommend it.

Cheers,

Marc
