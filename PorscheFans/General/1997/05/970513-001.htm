	Well, here it is. My long post detailing my wax experience. 
Delete now unless you really need to know details about waxes and waxing or 
are a masochist. Thanks go to Wes Shew for reminding me that I was supposed 
to get this out like a month ago :)

Basically, I followed the instructions that Larry Reynolds wrote about waxing 
and cleaning. You'll find these on the Sacramento Valley Web Page 
(http://www.vpm.com/pca-svr/tech.htm)
You can reach Larry at Car Care Specialties (carcaresp@aol.com). He'll have 
all the supplies you need (he's also a great guy and we owe him one for all 
the valuable info in his instructions). This was important for me because I 
couldn't find half the stuff locally. I used 3M Imperial Hand Glaze and 
covered that with One Grand Blitz Wax. Previous to this job, I used Mequiar's 
No.7 Glaze and No. 6 Cleaner/Wax last October. The car had not been done 
since then. The Mequiar's did a pretty good job. The paint 
still had a significant amount of "depth" to it and dirt and grime still 
rinsed off fairly easily. I switched to the 3M and One Grand based on 
Larry's recommendation and it was well worth it (but more on that later). The 
following are things you'll need to complete a thorough wax job:

lots of time (it took me about 7 hours from start to finish)
10-15 clean, 100% cotton towels, dish towel sized (you can't have too many)
1 spray mister
a wax and a glaze of some kind
endless patience
sunblock

First, clean the car *thoroughly*. If you wax the car with dirty, you can 
easily wax a scratch(s) right into the paint. I used Sonax myself but there 
are lots of good car washes. Once you have the car completely clean and 
dried, park it in the shade somewhere to do the actual waxing. Note: It's a 
good idea to start very early in the morning if you don't have a garage or 
shade readily available. You don't want to wax the car in the hot sun so you 
need to get the hood, top, and trunk done before the sun really gets going. I 
started at 6:30 am (my s.o. thinks I'm crazy). Now that the car is unexposed 
to the sun in some fashion, you can start applying the glaze. Put a little on 
one of the dish towels and rub it into a selected body panel in a linear 
fashion (back and forth , that is). Don't rub hard! This isn't a muscle 
contest. Just make sure you're getting the entire panel covered. Do one panel 
at a time i.e. hood, top, trunk, left fender, right fender, etc. and stop 
after that panel is covered. Let the glaze dry for a few minutes and take a 
break. After it's become "hazy", take a new towel and *gently* buff the 
glaze off. I can't emphasize the word gently enough. You can do some real 
damage to the paint especially on edges if you buff hard. Remember, this 
isn't a muscle contest, it's more of a chess match. You'll need real patience 
to buff the car slowly and thoroughly but it's the right way to do it. Just 
relax and try not to think about how long it's going to take. Once you've got 
the dried glaze completely buffed off one section of the car, apply the wax 
to that same section. In his article, Larry recommends you do this using your 
hand as the applicator pad. I thought this was sort of weird but I said what 
the heck, I'll try it. Now, I'm convinced it's the best method. First, if 
you're using carnuba-based wax, your body heat does help melt the wax and 
make it easier to spread. Most importantly, you can use your fingers to feel 
how much wax to spread. That is, it's very easy to tell when you've got too 
much in one area and you should spread it around. This is very important with 
carnuba wax because too much means you'll spend years buffing it off. It's 
gross, it's icky, but it's well worth it. Once the wax dries to a haze, 
*gently* buff it off with a new towel.Remember, gently. Carnuba wax takes 
forever to buff off so just be patient and go slowly if that's what you're 
using. As your various towels become too soiled to use, replace them with new 
ones from your stack-o-towels. Now comes the real pain in the ass part. You've
glazed the hood and buffed it, waxed the hood and buffed it, it should look
awesome, right? And it does...except for those big streaks running through it.
Don't panic. The first time this happened to me, I nearly had a heart attack 
because I thought I'd done something to the paint. Just relax and draw on that
infinite resolve of patience again. Take the spray mister and squirt some 
water on the affected area. Buff this area with a new towel until dry. 
Repeat as necessary until the streak is gone.Prepare yourself for this could 
take a long time. I spent 3 of the 7 hours that my wax job took simply buffing
the streaks out. This problem seems to be worse with dark colored cars so 
hopefully, yours is white or something like that. Eventually, you will get 
those streaks out. Once you've got them out, just move on to the next section 
of the car and repeat: glaze, buff, wax, buff, buff streaks out (if necessary).
Repeat for every section of the car until you're done. Some things to remember 
in conclusion; go slowly! The tortoise wins this race, not the hare. 
Toss your towels when they get dirty. Clean towels are easier to buff with. 
Too little is better than too much where waxes and glazes are concerned. 
You can always add a little more if you need to but removing the stuff is 
hell. Trust me. Now for the finished product...

My car looks *beautiful*. It has a really incredible shine. In fact, when 
it's sunny outside, the car is actually hard to look at because the 
reflection of the sun is so bright. At night, the car looks like liquid, 
black glass. You can literally fall into it forever. When the moon is
full, you can read by the reflection off the hood or top. It is a truly 
outstanding shine and very noticeably better then the Mequiar's products. One 
more thing; if you don't have a garage or park your car out in the sun during 
working hours, I urge you to get a car cover and use it. Not only will it 
protect your paint, but it will also protect your interior as well. Hope all 
this is of help to someone and feel free to email me with questions if I 
didn't cover something. Good luck!
