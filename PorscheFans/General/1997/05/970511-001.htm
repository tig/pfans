Hi all ... 

I'm looking to purchase a '86 911 cab from a local Porsche dealer.  I 
don't know much about the 911, and was hoping someone could send me or 
point me to some info/advice on this model Porsche.

I would like to know what this model's reliability is like, and what
issues I would look for or ask about before purchasing this vehicle. 
Also, what problem areas does this vehicle have, and which repairs are the
most common? (like, is electrical a problem, or do pumps regularly burn
out, etc.)

Vehicle looks very nice (white exterior, black cloth top, black leather
interior). Inside isn't perfect, but it looks good for an 11 year old car. 
Vehicle has 60k miles, and seems to drive pretty well.

Also, this Porsche dealer is said to have "a good reputation" -- but they
are only offering a 1yr/1,000mi warranty on the powertrain.  Is it
reasonable for me to think I should get a better warranty than that (like
something for 1yr), or should I just be thankful they are giving anything
at all? 

Thanks for any help!
