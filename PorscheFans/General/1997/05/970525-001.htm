I have to admit I am a babe in the woods when it comes to porsches .. this
will be my first purchase of one and I would love anyone with some
experiance to give me some insight in to the purchase.

I have two that I am currently looking at .. 

1. Porsche 924 - 1978 - Auto Trans, mechanically well maintaned (Spoke to
the mechanic) but needs to be stripped and painted and the interior needs
overhaul. asking price is $1350 but they are very flexable .. might get
them down to $900 .. 

2. Porsche 914 - 1972 - 1.7L I have yet to see this car though the 914's
intrique me. I have to wait for the owner to return from a trip. But a
mutual friend looked at the car and said it was in pretty good shape (needs
a good cleaning) .. but there was apparently a brace system under the car
that was added and then the car was undercoated... which is concerning to
me.. Price as of now is unk .. but was told to figure under $1000 .. 

Now I know these are low low end porsches .. but for me .. it's a start ..
any insight would be greatly appreciated ..

Rich
