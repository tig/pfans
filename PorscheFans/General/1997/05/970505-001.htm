    RENO, Nev., May 5 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of a company-wide
reorganization
of purchasing activities, Dr. Ing.h.c. F. Porsche AG has opened a North
American procurement office in Troy, Michigan.
          The task of the new purchasing office is to source goods and
services
throughout the entire North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region.
Porsche is intensifying its efforts to obtain automotive components for new
vehicle production and replacement parts, as well as tooling, machinery and
automotive accessories from the North American market.
          The move comes as part of an overall restructuring of Porsche's
purchasing
activities.  Greater emphasis will be placed on global sourcing, new
purchasing strategies, and increased support of Porsche's research,
development and consulting projects for outside clients.  Purchasing will be
divided into two sections, known internally as FE (operations purchasing) and
FS (strategic purchasing).  The U.S. office will work in parallel with these
organizations to ensure that Porsche's high standards of quality and
technology are maintained with any new sourcing initiatives.  The office,
which is located in Troy, Michigan, has been active since the beginning of
March 1997.
          Mr. James T. Watson has been named Vice President of the Porsche
Procurement Office.  He comes to Porsche after extensive experience in the
American automotive industry, having previously served as Director of
International Procurement and Supply for Chrysler Corporation.
          Mr. Watson will be joined by two purchasing officers from Porsche's
main
office, located at the Research and Development Center in Weissach (near
Stuttgart), Germany.  Mr. Steffen Spreiter takes up his American duties in
August 1997, and the second purchasing officer is expected in early 1998.
          Suppliers who have world class quality and technology capabilities
can
contact the named representatives at:
          Porsche Procurement Office
    1965 Research Drive
    Troy, MI 48083
    U.S.A.
