US spec airbags are designed to be used in conjunction with seat 
belts.  Air bags are only designed to deploy with a front end 
collision.  Seat belts protect the driver from hits on all four 
corners.

I believe that all of the deaths attributable to air bags have accured 
with passenger side bags.  Drivers side bags are much safer than 
passenger side, due to the close proximity to the driver.

I have only seen one fatality where an air bag deployed, in that accident the 
driver was not wearing a seat belt.  He slipped underneath the bag 
and was crushed by the fire wall.  Had he been wearing a seat belt, 
the air bag and belt would of saved his life.  Of course, he would 
have had serious leg injurys.  In my experience with high speed 
crashes (closing rate of 80+, no air bag) with all occupants wearing seat belts, 
passenger is fatal.  Driver is almost always fatal.  Rear seat 
passengers will survive a much more serious crash than the front seat 
occupants.

US air bags are attributed to have saved 7500 lives.  It is
unfortunate that those lives are forgotten in the light of the 50
that have died.

My understanding is that the low power versions come out in
'98.  I have not heard anything about smart airbags.  I have heard
that the low power versions will only be for passenger side bags.

Yes, it is a big pillow with an explosive charge behind it.  The 
explosive is the only way known to deploy the bag, before the occupant 
eats the steering wheel and windshield.  I have heard that taking an 
airbag hit is comparable to a shot from Mike Tyson.

Please do not get lulled into the belief that seat belts are the 
know-all, end all in safety.  In high speed crashes, I see serious 
seat belt related injuries.  These include; crushed pelvis, abdominal 
injuries, crushed chest, and collar bone fractures.  Of course all of 
these injuries beat being dead.

Take Care,
Ken
