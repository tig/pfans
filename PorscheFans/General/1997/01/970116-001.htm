Qualification: I am NOT a spark plug expert, nor combustion engineer,
just a self-proclaimed normal guy with a bit of physics background. And,
these are just my modest opinions about product claims I reject.

Yes, the spark(s) origin(s) extends from the center electrode in one
spark
to one side of the split and a second spark to the second side of the
split simultaneously (in ideal splitfire operation).

The way I see this is that the split is effectively increasing the
capacitive surface area of the (an/cath)ode.  In order to get a spark,
you need to build up a minimum capacitive charge density.  And, the
higher the charge density the hotter/bigger the spark.  So, IMHO,
under normal design conditions, with the splitfire you would get
two smaller/cooler sparks.  Or one larger but cooler spark.  However,
under sub-optimal conditions, like low-voltage idling (alternator not
up to full output), it seems possible that the charge density may be
near the minimum (diluted by the larger capacitive area), and the
plugs would tend to misfire more readily.

Perhaps this is what you're experience shows?

BTW, if you come across a better physics basis for the splitfire claims,
I would be quite interested.  As I said, I could be full of it.
