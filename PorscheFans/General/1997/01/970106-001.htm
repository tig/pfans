A friend of mine sent me the enclosed note, and I found it to be one of the 
more complete lists of upcoming track events.

David,

Hi!

As "threatened", I've collected a schedule of all marque club or public
(eg commercial) track events that I could find.  The schedule, posted at
http://www.pit-stop.com/trackevents/trackevents.shtml is currently still
evolving at a rapid pace as events are confirmed, rescheduled or added
or as my input errors are corrected.  At some point in the future, once
the schedule ceases to change for about two weeks in a row (??? maybe
around mid-February), the schedule's version stamp will change from "0x"
to "1x".
Still to be added are each event's registrar.  Oh well, maybe within a
few weeks.
For those of you who contributed events or contacts - THANK YOU.  Please
remember to try to notify me of any changes.

One good turn deserves another,
Dale Smith

Keep On Track
