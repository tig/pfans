Yes, accounts of personal experiences (good or bad) help us
all make better choices.

I'm somewhat surprised.  I've ordered alot through Vertex and,
except for one incident with rebuilt alternator, I've been
generally quite satisfied.

BTW, the alternator incident proved to be very costly, but Mike
@ Vertex was very accomodating in resolving the issue, and
I was relatively satisfied in the outcome.  I think the problem
had more to do with the quality control at the alternator
rebuild shop they use?

Keep Porsching,
