Leland West are brokers who offer auto insurance to PCA members; they
currently use American Modern Insurance Company to provide coverage.  Their
premiums are cheap, as they should be, given the stringent underwriting
criteria.  How do they (American Modern) do when there is a claim?

So far, not so well.  My 86' 928S was (gently) rear-ended on December 24.
Damage was limited to a torn bumper cover and a scratched/punctured panel
below the hatch door.  It required 3 days to reach a human being to report
the accident.  On January 2 a local claims adjustor was apparently FAXed
and asked to call me.  This has not yet happened as of Tuesday, January 7.
Fourteen days (and counting) seems a long time, even with holidays
intervening.  Would they do better with a more serious claim, or would you
simply suffer worse consequences?

Have others had favorable or unfavorable claims experience with American
Modern?

I will post a follow-up on how this turns out.
