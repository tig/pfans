>     An old friend came into town and we decided to do a little new car 
>     test driving.  Stopped by the Mitsubishi dealer- they blew us off 
>     (should have put on one of my suits!).  I did get to sit in a nice AWD 
>     3000GT, didn't even come close to fitting (I'm 6'7").  I told the 
>     salesman I was very interested in purchasing a sports car and he told 
>     me the only one I would fit in would be a Porsche.  Imagine that, must 
>     be a German/Asian thing.

>     We did manage to do some very "spirited" driving in a Subaru Outback 
>     (the rather green faced salesman kept muttering, "...its no sports 
>     car, but...").  Now that's one really fun car for the money.  Great 
>     pep, all time AWD, and very impressive traction control.  I did a 
>     straight line braking test with half the car on gravel and half on 
>     pavement- perfect response.  The suspension on the car was excellent 
>     as well- I would like to try one in the cones.  Might even be worth 
>     renting for the day, beats Disneyland!
