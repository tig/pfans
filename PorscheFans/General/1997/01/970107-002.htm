We are used to hearing rave reviews about claims service, and are
upset you had the problems related to us over the phone (and also via
email) today.

From what we have heard so far, the adjuster *apparently* lost the
fax from American Modern authorizing them to begin work.  We called
the adjuster, who professed ignorance.  They in turn called American
Modern, who immediately re-faxed the order to begin work.

The adjusting firm has told us that, as a result of receiving the
order, Michael Wu will be contacting you within 24 hours to adjust
the claim.  If the matter is fairly straightforward, which it sounds
like, You should be receiving a check shortly thereafter.

It is important for you to understand it is our job to help you when
problems occur...  but you have to let us know.  The issue appears to
be resolved now, and we heard about it roughly *two hours* ago.  THAT
is the kind of service we provide in this program.  If you get
anything different, give us a ring and we'll fix it.

Finally, FYI, let me say a bit about claims in general in the Select
program.  We have one, single individual dedicated to handling
program claims.  The benefit is that you have an individual who knows
Porsches, and works with them daily.  You won't have to explain that
a duck-tail is not a replacement part on your Weissach 911, or that
H1's really, really do cost that much to replace.

Where does the car get fixed after an accident?  Well, where do you
want it fixed?  We know we aren't insuring Yugos, and owners are
particular about who works on their car.  While American Modern *may*
suggest a repair site, they will not require one if you prefer
otherwise.

You also get an agreed value in case of a total loss.  That means if
the car is totaled or stolen we cut a check for the agreed value. 
Period.

We're here to do one job, and do it well.  If you have any questions
on these or other related matters, feel free to drop us a line.  Our
web site is also loaded with details on the program, so any questions
you may have might be answered there.
