        I have had a request to state why products like Slick 50 and others 
     are not recommended for use in cars in general and Porsches in 
     particular.
     
     To that end, I have decided to post a copy of that initial post I made 
     to another list for your review.
     
     I should also mention that many of the after-market oil additives have 
     properties that are claimed to reduce friction by coating engine 
     parts.  In part, there exists some dangers with this practice.  The 
     major downfall is the entrapment of the acidic byproducts that are 
     normal to combustion engines on our internal bearings and seals.  
     Teflon is also thought to be a contributor to both this coating and 
     the production of hydrofluoric acid.  It is for that reason that 
     products that contain TFE be avoided.  I would also recommend avoiding 
     the other additives as they may have unwanted side effects as well.  I 
     recommend the "Golden Rule" of oil to be followed (if it really works, 
     The oil companies would use it) when considering dumping additives in 
     your expensive machines.
     
     The following was a response to someone's question.
     
     I would appreciate any responses (positive and negative) to this post, 
     please send them to my home E-mail if you would:

     I agree that a lot depends on how you drive.  However, as you stated 
     that the "real data" may not be there to back it up, I must point out 
     that your two cars can not be used as dependable evidence that the 
     10,000 mile interval is the correct interval.  The sample size is just 
     too small, and unless you have done an engine tear down, you can't be 
     sure what the 10,000 mile intervals are doing for or against you.  
     Granted, with cars getting above the 313,000 mile mark, there is some 
     evidence that the 944 motor (as with many newer cars) is a robust 
     engine.
     
     Some of my data comes from the article in Excellence magazine by Andy 
     Saunders (Excellence, May 1994, pp. 81).  Saunders does not make claim 
     as to what intervals should be used, but does point out why oil should 
     be changed.  Sauders cites "The most important duty of detergent 
     additives is to neutralize acid combustion byproducts, preventing all 
     kinds of wear" [pp. 82].  His point is to reduce the concentrations of 
     acids that build up over time.  That is why I recommended the 3 - 4 
     month interval if you do
     not drive often.
     
     Another common problem is low mileage driving.  If your trips are 
     short, you add further risk of the acid build up.  Saunders last quote 
     "In adverse conditions, oil should be changed frequently. Cars driven 
     for short distances in town - particularly cars with 11 quart oil 
     tanks - take time to warm up.  If oil is not allowed to attain a 
     temperature of 90 degrees C, corrosive acids build up, leading to 
     sludge, a milky coating on the oil cap, and rapid internal 
     corrosion"[pp. 84].
     
     Lastly, Saunders makes a reference to the Teflon additives that are 
     found in products like Slick 50.  "DuPont, the developer of Teflon, 
     stopped supplying oil companies with the slippery stuff in 1980. Since 
     then, other suppliers have stepped in and Teflon remains on the market 
     although its claimed advantages are unsupported by test results.  Oil 
     companies are unconvinced of its value, suggesting you consider what 
     happens if you use a metal spatula on a Teflon pan.  They also point 
     out that above 400 degrees C - a temperature easily exceeded in the 
     combustion chamber - Teflon breaks down to form hydrofluoric acid, one 
     of the most reactive acids known, capable of causing extreme damage to 
     thermal reactors, catalyst, and exhaust system"[pp. 83].
     
     I am sorry that I do not have other sources at my finger tips, but my 
     time is short.  For me, I will pay the, price of oil changes.  For 
     regular Castrol at $1.00 a quart, at 24 quarts per year, for ten years 
     is $240.00. That is far, far less than any engine rebuild.  Even 
     adding filters at four per year, at $5.00, or $20.00 per year, the 
     total of $450.00 over a ten year period is pocket change (less than 
     $1.00 per week)!
     
     The prosecution rests, I will let the jury decide if the 3,500 mile 
     interval is "extreme overkill".  It's your engine though.
