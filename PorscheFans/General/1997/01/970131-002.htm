William Spiegel asks

>>In reading the [Boxster] manual several questions arise.
I hope some of you can enlighten me....

>>1) What RPM would be considered luggung the engine? Is this entirely
by feel? I will be using this car as a daily driver and 
probably will not be screaming at 5000 rpm in heavy
traffic.

It's a guesstimate and varies among car designs but say below 2000 rpm for
most, although some cars are perfectly happy to cruise even lower than that
in sixth gear (when they have one), etc. Certainly below 1500 is considered
lugging on just about any car. For some "peaky" engines, full throttle below
2000 is a bit too much to ask.

The Boxster is a bit on the "peaky" side, with maximum torque coming at a
relatively high 4500 rpm. Compare that to large American V8 engines, which
won't rev much above 5000 rpm, and you can guess that the American engine
will be happier at low revs than the Boxster. 

>>2) There is a break in period of 1000 miles where the
engine is not to be taken over 4200 rpm.  This seems
very low!! Not even up to the torque peak! I thought that
Porsche engines are redlined at the factory as part of
initial testing.

The breakin period won't hurt but I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
Manufacturers always put these clauses in there even though they've already
tested or driven the car well beyond those limits. Porsche especially will
test the car on the dyno and again on the road. I just tested a Boxster from
the press fleet with less than 400 miles on the clock, and apparently the
folks who manage the fleet had no second thoughts about letting one out for
drag strip testing. My personal record for low mileage on a test car is 80
miles, on a Toyota of some sort.

[Later] Bob Hill said >>Notice I said "occasional". Don't run the thing at
6500 RPM
  for 2 hours. Vary your road speed and engine speed during the 1000 miles.

Good idea. Nothing bad will happen if you go above that 4200 rpm
occasionally, but for your own peace of mind just take it easy and then
you'll never worry about it again. 

I can't help on the other questions.
