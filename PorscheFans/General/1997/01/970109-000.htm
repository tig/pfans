David,
I would guess, that they have their sale in January, to increase sales 
volume in a notoriously slow month.  I just picked up an order from 
them using the summer catalog.  I was happy and surprised to find out 
that the prices on many of the items I purchased have gone down since 
the summer catalog came out.  I find performance very competative on 
most parts.  Stoddards seems to be cheaper on factory parts, but then 
performance will always match any catolog price.

Take Care,
Ken
