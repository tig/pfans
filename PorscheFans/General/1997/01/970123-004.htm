Hi,

I own a '79 930. About a month ago I started experiencing
this weird problem. As I would come on boost the engine
would momentarily bog down. It felt as though the fuel
pumps shut down. If you've ever had your boost turned
up too high and had your pumps shut down, you'll no what I'm talking
about. This happened on 4 seperate occasions. All more
than 1 week from the next. Finally, my car stalled on 
me one day. I brought the car to the shop figuring they
would solve my problem. The diagnosis was an alternator
charging at only 12 volts. I was told that with the low
charge, the load from the fuel pumps was too much and 
so the circuit shut down. Ok, I thought. My hope was that
my other problem was a symptom of this alternator prob.

I picked up my car and drove for a good 15 minutes, so
the car was nice and warmed up. As I got to highway
speeds and started to accelerate, the problem started
again. This time it was worse however. Now it appears 
as though anytime the car is warmed up (and only when
warmed up) and when I start to come on boost, the engine
bogs down. This is very disconcerting to say the least.

My question, has anyone out there experienced a similar
problem?

In talking with my mechanic, he felt that it was not
a fuel, nor an ignition problem. He felt that somehow
I was losing boost pressure. His suggestion was to take
off the intercooler and take a look at a valve, located
inside the intake manifold. I guess this valve is
supposed to open under boost and close when off boost.
His remark was that in 25 years he's never seen this
problem and he's never seen this valve fail. 

Anyway, that's where I'm at. And, my car sits helplessly.
I'm leary to try this fix as even my mechanic feels that
it probably won't help. His last words to me were, 
"this is one of those kinds of problems that are hard to
diagnose and could be very costly to try the individual
fixes". 

I'd really appreciate any help or thoughts.

Thanks,

Erik
