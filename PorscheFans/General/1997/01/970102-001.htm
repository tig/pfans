I was e-mailed this and passed it on as requested.

>>
>>      Subject: Consumer Fights Back!!!
>>
>>      My daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in
>>      Dallas & decided to have a small dessert.  Because both of us are
>>      such cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie".  It
>>      was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and
>>      the waitress said with a small frown "I'm afraid not."  "Well" I
>>      said, "would you let me buy the recipe?"  With a cute smile, she said
>>      "Yes". I asked how much and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a
>>      great deal!"  I said with approval, "just add it to my tab".
>>
>>      Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus
>>      and it was $285.00.  I looked again and remembered I had only spent
>>      $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at
>>      the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00".
>>      That's outrageous!!  I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them
>>      the waitress said it was "two-fifty", which clearly does not mean
>>      "two hundred and fifty dollars" by any POSSIBLE interpretation of the
>>      phrase.  Neiman-Marcus refused to budge. They would not refund my
>>      money, because according to them, "What the waitress told you is not
>>      our problem.  You have already seen the recipe - we absolutely will
>>      not refund your money at this point."  I explained to her the
>>      criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer
>>      them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General
>>      for engaging in fraud.  I was basically told, "Do what you want, we
>>      don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your money."  I waited a
>>      moment, thinking of how I could get even, or even try to get any of
>>      my money back. I just said "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm
>>      going to have $250.00 worth of fun."  I told her that I was going to
>>      see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail
>>      account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.
>>      She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this."  I said, "Well you should
>>      have thought of that before you ripped me off, and slammed down the
>>      phone on her.
>>
>>      So, here it is!!!  Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you
>>      can possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this ... I don't want
>>      Neiman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this recipe ...
>>
>>      (Recipe may be halved):
>>
>>      2  cups butter
>>      4  cups flour
>>      2  tsp. baking soda
>>      2  cups granulated sugar
>>      2  cups brown sugar
>>      5  cups blended oatmeal
>>      (measure oatmeal and blend in blender to a powder) 
>>      24 oz. chocolate chips
>>      1  tsp. salt
>>      1  8 oz. Hershey bar (grated)
>>      4  eggs
>>      2  tsp. baking powder
>>      3  cups chopped nuts (your choice)
>>      2  tsp. vanilla
>>
>>      Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together
>>      with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add chocolate
>>      chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches
>>      apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.  Makes
>>      112 cookies.
>>
>>      Have fun!!!  This is not a joke - this is a true story ... Ride free
>>      citizen!
