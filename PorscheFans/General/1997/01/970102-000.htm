Hi.

I put my name on a list at the S.F. Moscone car show for one of those
"Citicars".  Just saw one on the road the other day.  It is a very
compact thing, like a coleman cooler with wheels.  'Cute' and urban
looking in that plastic cooler kinda way.  The funky green color made me
think of the movie  Soilent(sic) Green, remember it?

On the questionaire I put down $15k or less as a selling point, since
it's made up of mostly recyled plastic materials!  I think the electric
car is ideal for single person type of short commuting in densely packed
cities (or smaller areas within) like S.F. but safety might be an issue
ie. red light runners.  Oh well, the city just announced the desire to
add 200 more camera equipped intersections but that's after the fact of
an accident anyways.

I've seen photos of the GM car and it is ugly.  I cannot believe the
performance is so poor too from GM, electric or otherwise.  $35k?  Who
are they trying to kid?  It is a loser already.

 Wow, it looks like this generation is going to see the first real wave
of electric cars hit the public roads.  I will not give up my Porsche
though.

Phil
