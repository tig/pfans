Congratulations!  I guarantee you will love it.

I only have about 300 miles on mine so far so I've been trying to
follow the breakin instructions.  I try to keep it above 2K rpm, but
it doesn't make lugging noises even when I drop down to 1700 or 1500.
It seems like there is a pretty big low end.

When I was at the factory ten years ago, they would take each engine
and test it on a test stand for some period.  Part of the test was
running at redline for some period.  Because of this, I'm not sure it
is that important to keep the revs low for the first 1K miles, but I'm
trying anyway.  I think most modern engines don't really require much
breakin.

As above, I'm not sure its a big deal.  However, even when I keep it
below 4200 the car is very pleasant to drive and feels spirited.  It
accellerates fine and doesn't feel like a burden.  Probably after
breakin, most boring around town driving will be done below 4500
anyway.

Good luck with your new car,
