Just a quick one:  Don't believe UPS or whoever will get your order to
you in a shorter time just because you're in the same state!  I believed
my salesman that, "oh you're in California too? It'll be there in 2 days
without spending for 2nd day air..."   If you need it, pay for the
guaranteed expedite.

On another occasion, I ordered lots of stuff with 2 weeks of advance for
my deadline.  Standard ground is 5 -7 working days.  WORKING days.  That
meant my cushion had deterioted by the time I got around to checking
with the mail order company.  Short story is, they NEVER shipped the
goods to begin with for some strange reason.  I canceled the entire
order and probably will never do business with them ever, especially
since they went ahead and charged me anyways.  It's cleared off finally.

Other than those two examples, I have a great time shopping by phone.  

Phil
