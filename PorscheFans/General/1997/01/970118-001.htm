The Western Washington Porsche dealers have received one red Boxster each.
The people with deposits are driving them this week. I was able to sit in
one, start the engine and put the top up and down.I am surprised how noisy
the engine is. It sounds just like a 911, in fact reminds me of my old 914-6.
The seats are firm but fairly comfortable. The door openings with the top up
are fairly low, whacked my head. The front trunk is surprisingly deep. The
rear less so. If golf clubs are to fit in there, they would have to fold in
half. Even though the price right now is "low", the prices of all the extras,
a mile long list, are sky high. For example, some kind a light to illuminate
the console, $241.00. If you want a full leather interior, it's going to be
lipstick red or green. For a more less full list of options on all models,
take a look at Porsche South Africa's homepage. There are links to all
models. Keep in mind that these are options and price indications for that
area and may not be totally accurate for US models. Makes interesting
reading.
