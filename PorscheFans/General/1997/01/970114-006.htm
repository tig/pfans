	This should all be covered in your owners manual. If you
	don't have one, you need to get one. The 944 doesn't really
	need a "tune-up" like old American cars. Just replace the plugs
	and various sensors and filters when you're supposed to and
	you'll be okay. The timing belt should be replaced every 30K.
	Follow this religiously or you may be very sorry. In addition,
	the belt should be re-tensioned at the 2K mark after replacement.
	Keep an eye on your water pump. If it starts leaking, replace
	it immediatly as catastrophic water pump failure can lead
	to catastrophic timing/cam belt failure. Also, when doing the
	belts, make sure the belt rollers (there are 5) are in good shape.
	Replace the air filter when it's dirty. This varies depending
	on how and where you drive. I see you're at the 80K mark. If you
	haven't done any of this yet or don't know when it was last done,
	see to it asap. Good luck!
