Multiple points of ignition can help overall combustion, but
for 99% of all combustion processes, the multiple sparks
need to be much farther apart than the 2mm distance between
the split electrodes on the split-fire plug.

I would like to add a few words to points below:

The multiple plugs don't keep it from exploding, they help
control where/when the explosions take place.  The combustion
process is very fast, but in ultra high performance applications,
with ultra precise design of the combustion chamber and/or
desired combustion event, the flame front and subsequent propogation
can be somewhat tailored by initiating sparks in different locations
and/or at different times.  If the goal is to accelerate the overall
combustion event, multiple simultaneous sparks in different parts
of the chamber (ie. multiple plugs) will initiate multiple flame
fronts and therefore accelerate the overall combustion.  Also,
if the sparks are spaced in time, you can mildly tailor the
pressure distribution caused by the multiple flame fronts.

I would guess that at 11,000 RPM, they wanted the fastest complete
combustion event possible.  So, starting the fire at three different
points in the combustion chamber simply helped do that.

Of course, I could be full of sh*t.
