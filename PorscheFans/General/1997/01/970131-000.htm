I just thought You might be interested in this:

Porsche Boxster's will also be made in Finland!

There was a story in papers today, 31/01/97, that Porsche has made 
a 2 year agreement with Valmet Uudenkaupungin-autotehdas, quite a
word, to make the new Boxster also in Finland. The waiting time for a
new Boxster is even over a year, so this is the remedy.
Anyhow this is the only car factory in Finland that make passenger cars, 
no "own models", but they make Saab convertibles, Opel Calibra, an 
European part of GM, Calibra is a sleek sportscar. If You have followed 
the DTM / ITC races, You have seen the bodystyle. Also they make a
Russian car, Lada Samara to something they call EuroSamara.
To my knowledge all Saab convertibles are made in Finland, factory 
suitable for small runs, and this makes me proud, better quality. 
Check under the hood of a Saab cabrio, there should be a sticker on 
the driver side fender, Made in Finland.

According to press release the production will be 5 000 - 10 000 cars/year.
Valmet (the long word) was chosen because factory has shown good
quality and ability to keep production schedule. 

The Finnish ex-Porsche dealer has sold one Boxster as a tax free car, 
no street price for the Boxster, but it would be about 105.000,-USD.
Sales tax 22%, car tax is also something unbelievable.

About 1 000 Porsches here, mostly 944 models, the Porsche dealer
in Finland quit, Porsche is working on getting a new dealer here.

Im not on the Boxster list, so if any comments & questions, please
E-mail directly or to General list.
