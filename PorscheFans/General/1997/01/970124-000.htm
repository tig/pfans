Erik Johnson wrote a discription of the problems associated with his
930 shutting off from boost that are almost identical to the problem I
had a couple of years ago with an '82 931 (aka 924 turbo) that I used to
own.  The problem with my car was a ruptured waste gate diaphragm.  When
the diaphragm ruptures it allows to boost to surge until the fail-safe
electric fuel pump cut-off switch is activated.  This stops you immediately
until the boost pressure drops again to below the shut-off point.  As I recall,
my 931 had a huge amount of power until that point was reached.  I understand
that the 931 and early 930 boost systems are almost the same, so this story
may be relevant to diagnosing the present problem.  You can buy new diaphragms
from suppliers such as Andial, EBS,,etc.  I'm not sure if PCNA sells just
the diaphragms or wants you to buy the entire waste gate.  Anyway, I got my
part from a non-PCNA source.  Good luck.
