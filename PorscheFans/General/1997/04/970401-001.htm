Hi all,
  I am just about to by a second hand 911 and have come across what 
appears to be a completely original 1981 SC in excellent condition. My 
only worry is that there is a small spot of rust (2" square) below one of 
the headlamps. I was under the impression that Porsches only rust if the 
body suffered some serious scraping, am I right? 

The guy selling it suggested that it was caused by a stone chip, and I 
noticed that the headlamp glass above it has a tiny hole in it, which I 
would guess did come from a stone.

Porsches are quite rare over here, so I don't really have an oppurtunity
to check any of a similar age, so any advice would be appreciated - should
I be suspicious of it, or am I being over cautious? 

Thanks in advance,
Conor Ryan.
