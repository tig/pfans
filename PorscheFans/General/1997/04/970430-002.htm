I was told the Simpson helmets did not undergo any changes to meet the
SA standards besides the nomex liner.

I understand the difference in the Snell specification between the M and
the SA rating.

That's what makes the obligatory use of SA helmets at the Parade
autocross so ludicrous. Unfortunately, the local regions are mandating
the same for their autocrosses since they are probably worried about the
legal implications of someone getting hurt with lower standards than
those used by the national organization. I'm sure any lawyer could get a
lot of mileage from that. 

If M85 is good enough for SCCA Solo I (which also requires a roll bar,
window net, kill switch, and full driver's suit to compete), it is
certainly good enough for PCA drivers ed.

Thanks! I'll respond privately with my address.
