Paul,

I beg to differ with you on that helmet not changing.  It may me true
that the M85 and M90/95 helmets have not changed, but I know for a
fact that there was a major change to the interior of the helmets
starting with the SA90's.  As a former SCCA scrutineer, and last years
safety chairman for our PCA region, I have done a little investigating
on helmets.

The difference in the M rated helmets and the SA rated helmets is the
impacts they are designed to withstand.  Typically a motorcycle helmet
is designed to protect the rider from glancing blows to different
parts of the head as the rider slides down the road.  An automobile
helmet is designed to withstand multiple blunt impacts to s single
spot.  I.E. your head bouncing off a roll bar in an accident.  The
nomex lining is just an added extra.  In fact, years ago you used to
be able to buy both S and SA helmets.  The only difference being the
nomex liner.

It's the inner liner, not the outside shell that is protecting your
head.  That's why many PCA regions are requiring SA helmets for their
drivers ed events.  Your current helmet should be OK for autocross
events.  Last time I checked, you could still use M/S/SA 85 helmets
for SCCA Solo I events.

Somewhere in this house I have the information sent to me by the Snell
=46oundation.  I'll find it and send you a copy if you want to see it.
