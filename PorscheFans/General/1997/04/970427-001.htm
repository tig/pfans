I FEBRUARY  1997I PURCHASED A 911 TURBO. MY CAR HAS HAD TWO ALTERNATOR BELTS
BREAK ONE WHILE I WAS DRIVING ( I ALMOST CRASHED), ONE ALTERNATOR BELT PULLEY
REPLACED, FRONT END WORK,
ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, SUN ROOF WOULD NOT CLOSE, CAR TOWED FOUR 
TIMES, THE TRANSMISSION HAS TO BE REPLACED, AND LAST PORSCHE 
ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE DRAGGED MY CAR ON THE GROUND AND DISTROYED MY FRONT END.
PORSCHE CARS NORTH AMERICA DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I DO NOT WANT THIS
$120,000.00 LEMON. IF YOU WANT FURTHER INFO. PLEASE CONTACT JOHN CROWE AT
PORSHE 702-348-3080. 
YOU E-MAIL ME AT CHENDER226@AOL.COM AND ASK FOR CURTIS HENDERSON. 

PLEASE UNDERSTAND DISPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR I AM A LOYAL 
CUSTOMER TO PORSCHE. THAT IS WHY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE MANAGEMENT AT
PORSCHE IS NOT HELPING ME SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF WE DO NOT CORRECT PROBLEMS
LIKE THIS ONE DAY YOU COULD BE IN MY POSITION. THIS IS MY SECOND 1997 911.
