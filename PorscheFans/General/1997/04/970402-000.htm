Catching up on previous subjects, I notice quite some heat over the cost 
of maintenance of a Porsche, and discussion along the lines that if you 
can afford a 993, then you can afford the maintenance.

I have a 993 (I am trying to afford it!), and I take the view that 
maintenance is a part of the cost of ownership just like insurance and the 
monthly finance payment.  I guess I have an expectation that maintenance 
will be costly for a high performance machine, and I expect I should spend 
money on keeping this wonderful piece of engineering in good shape.  
Parting would be agony, but the pain would be greater if it sold for less 
than what it should due to poor care and feeding.

I have waited over 25 years to fulfil this dream.  Back in 1970, when I 
thought the 911E was the ultimate machine, all I had were the magazine 
articles.  Now I drive something that exceeds those dreams and while I 
don't desire to be ripped off, I realise that this technology is expensive 
stuff and is supported by more expensive technology.

To sum it up, I look at the bottom line, not how it gets there.  My 993 is 
ourageously expensive to acquire.  I can't get upset about the cost of 
maintenance and not the purchase price!
