There are some companys that will create an injection system for you and
at a reasonable(?) cost. AirSensors built one for me and I have been
pleased with it. It is a constant flow system that uses a hot wire. I
think they are out of California now. 
	On the Porsche cost question; If it can't be kept up reasonably well it
may be better to go with something else until things change. As a drag
racer of American machines for many years it was difficult for me when I
got an older Mercedes and had to put a cam and rockers in it. I could
have replaced the whole engine in a Chev for what those parts cost me!!!
But when it was done, man, what a machine! The same goes for the '77
911S we have now. We bought it and put a new engine and trani in it.
Expensive? You bet! Worth it? No question about it. The only bad thing
is the addiction. I want another one. And an oil cooler. And bigger sway
bars. Wait! Maybe I should sell the house and buy a new one! It would be
easy to get carried away. As a family with a middle income it hasn't
been easy at times when the wallet opened and the seemingly endless flow
of cash begin, but we have no regrets about it. For my wife it is a
dream of 20 years fullfilled. For me it is a precision finely crafted
performance car that can cruise or attack the road with equal ease.
Great fun these Porsches!!!
