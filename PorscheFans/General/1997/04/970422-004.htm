Hi,

There's a shop in Vancouver, B.C. with a '93 RS America for sale
if anyone's interested. I just had a (brief) look at the car... here's
some particulars...

Colour:    silver, black interior
Mileage:   about 25,000 km
Condition: some MINOR damage to left rear quarter panel which is being
           repaired by the shop. Otherwise (from what I could see)
           excellent.
Options:   Don't have full list. The car does NOT have A/C or a sunroof,
           does have a radio and possibly limited slip. No power steering.
           cloth seats.

Asking price is $62,900 CDN.


I have no connection to this car or to the shop in question... contact
Tim Walker at Weissach Performance, (604) 738-3911 if interested. Tim
knows me, so you can drop my name if you want but it probably won't
buy you anything ;^)
