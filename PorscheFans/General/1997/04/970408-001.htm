Hello Everyone,

I have Recently gotten my first Porsche...A 89' 944S2....and at first it
seemed fast enough.....But then I caught this disease that made my car
feel slow. I have been told this disease can be very hard on the wallet
and on relationships...  I have found treatment ( Not Cure, Mind you...)
in "Excellence" Magazine. My Problem is this......It Seems that all the
modifications for killer performance are based around the 944 Turbo...
and I am wondering if  spending the money on tinkering with my 16 valve
is worth it or should I wait and spend the money on getting a 944
Turbo?  If I do Tinker with my S2, what is a good place to start and
what will give me the best bang for the Buck?  Any help you can give me
would be greatly appreciated..... Also if any one knows of a good =
performance shop in the Atlanta area I would like to find some one I can =
trust..

PS: I am a Software Engineer and Web Developer for Intuitive Technology
Consultants, Inc. and I have started work on a web site that should do
justice even to Porsche... I would love some suggestions for content.
Thanks!
