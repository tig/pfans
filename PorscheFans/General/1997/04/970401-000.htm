Hi,

I'm new to this list, as I haven't owned a Porsche, but have been
thinking/looking/reading/drooling for a couple of years now.

I finally dropped by the local Porsche dealer to take a look at the
Boxster.  I am soooo depressed.  Climbing into the driver's seat, I found
my scalp pasted to the roof.  Taking a seat in a new 911 next to it, I
found even less head room.  I am 6' 3" tall, and apparently that is too
tall to sit comfortably in these cars.  Am I missing something?  Any tall
Porsche owners out there?  Any models or years which provide an inch or two
more room?
