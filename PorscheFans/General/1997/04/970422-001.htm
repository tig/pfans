I am finally doing it.  I have put it off for three years.  Has anyone ever
heard of Horizon Motorsports driver training program?

They put you in groups based on experience, either novice (no experience), or
rookie (some kart racing / lapping / or one solo school).  The best finisher
in these groups wins a series of 12 races in a summer F2000 series.  

The first day is spent in a Z-28 Camaro for training, and the second day is
spent in an F2000 race car for testing.  You are compared with a pro
benchmark, through a formula that uses fastest laps.  If you win, and one
from each group wins, you get the summer series paid for.  If you win in the
summer series, you are eligible for 1998 sponsorship test. 

In any event, even if you don't win you had two fun days of racing school.
 Price is $1495 for remaining seats.  Regular price is $2000.  School is
close to Belleville (outside Toronto), at the Shannonville racetrack.  

Two years ago when I first thought about it the odds were 1 in 25, last year
when I thought really hard about it the odds were 1 in 20, and this year they
announced that the odds would be 1 in 16.  However, they didn't get enough
entries this year, and the odds have dropped to 1 in 10.  I couldn't wait any


longer.  There will be a guaranteed six prizes awarded, and the enrollment is
now capped at 60 total.  10 in each test group.

They still have three dates available if anyone is interested:  May 15/16,
 20/21 (the date I picked), and 29/30.  If you want anymore info you can
email me or contact Charlie Goodman at (352) 596-5021 until April 28, and
then at 613-969-0334.

It would be cool to see some other 928's at the track, or at the least have
someone else try the school out.  I can't wait.
