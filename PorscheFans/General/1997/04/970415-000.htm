Troy,
Are you aware that the CEO of Porsche Cars of America is on record as
saying that Porsche would cut off the supply of Boxsters to dealers that
charge over the MSRP for the car? I think a couple of well placed calls
and complaint letters  to the corporate headquarters might help you out.
He can't engage in price fixing, but basically he said something to the
effect of "You know how supply works and I know how supply works, and it
can be made to work very slowly!" Give it a try, and let us know how it
goes.
