Due to what I consider to be overwhelming irrationality, I find myself
in need of an SA90 or SA95 helmet in order to enter driver's ed and
autocross events with the local PCA chapter.

I have a perfectly good M85 helmet from Simpson (the one that makes you
look like Darth Vader). It is EXACTLY THE SAME as the SA90 and SA95
models except the lining is not Nomex. They have not changed a thing
about this helmet in the last 12 years. Ask them yourself!

If I was required to wear Nomex clothes, shoes, and underwear to enter
these events, I could understand (to some extent) why the Safety Nazis
would require this additional expenditure. 

The only explanation I have heard (from people making speculations why
this decision was made) was that helmets have some sort of inherent
shelf-life before they decompose and are no longer of any use. I claim
this time period can be measured in Millenia. It consists of plastic and
styrofoam. As any garbologist will tell you, these do not decompose!

Don't get me wrong. I am all for safety when it has some useful purpose,
but I have to consider this a knee-jerk reaction. 

Wanna buy a Simpson M85 helmet cheap? Any leads on where I can find a
bogus Snell SA sticker and some blue cloth (Nomex optional)?
