Sorry for the bandwidth,  but we are trying to get the word out about this
exciting driving event.

On June 13 & 14 1997 the Lone Star Region Porsche Club of America will be
hosting a Porsche Club Race at Texas World Speedway - 'Deep in the Heart of

Texas'.  Located between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in Bryan/College
Station TX.  (Proud home of Texas A&M Aggies)
TWS is one of the fastest, if not 'the' fastest oval in the U.S.  It is
built
with a surface "as smooth as a baby's bottom", too.  (Modeled after
Michigan.)
The 1.8 mile road course we will be using is located between the steep 2
miles
of bank and utilizes the front straight for added thrills and excitement.
Dropping into turn one can be VERY exciting! Just ask the IMSA guys that
race
there.
This Porsche Club Race is open to all PCA Club Racers and will be held the
weekend prior to this years Parade in San Antonio TX.  As is the tradition,

the event will be on Friday and Saturday before Sunday's Parade kickoff the

15th.
An open Drivers Ed day will be held on Thursday the 12th.  This Drivers
Education day is open to all drivers.  (PCA Club Race License not required.
However,  some experience required.  Call for details.)

The anticipated cost are:
 $80 for Drivers Ed (lapping day - optional, of course)
 $250 for the race (Friday & Saturday)  $200 payment made before 5/15/97
As always- great racing, great friends, great food & GREAT FUN.
