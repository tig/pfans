Hello all you Porsche Fans,
 I am having trouble deciding which Porsche I should purchase. I really
love the 911, but it is to expensive..but I could buy an old one. Then I
looked at the 944, and liked what I saw, at a good price. At first I
didn't like the 928, but I am now considering it. I am only 17, and plan
to buy in the next year or so. I need something that can be used as a
daily driver. I don't want a car that is always going to be in the shop.
Oh yea, can a general repair shop work on Porsches, or should I take it
to a Porsche shop. Could someone please tell me which car would be best
for my situation.
 Thanks, Steve
.
