Dear Mr. President:

The following MUST stop.  Somebody must develop detection devices, and the
public must be told how to prepare NOW so that not one life is lost.  Please
 get somebody on this immediately.  Thank you, sir.  Also, please read the
following .............

To:     All Observers  

From: Tetrahedron Incorporated
 
Topic: Larry Harris, Biological Attack, and Psychological Warfare on America

Numerous questions have arisen regarding Larry Harris's credibility and his
predictions and prescriptions for biological warfare aimed against the United
States and our people. I am extremely suspicious of Larry Harris for at least
six reasons:

1) Mr. Harris is virtually practicing medicine without a license on a public
health scale as he has recommended that people go out and buy antibiotics to
be taken at the first sign of trouble. I am not opposed to stockpiling and
refrigerating antibiotics as a preventive measure, but before treatment is
initiated, diagnosis is critical. Many antibiotic resistant strains of
bioweapons have been produced making one's choice of antibiotic moot in the
absence of laboratory analysis.

Moreover, on occasion, Mr. Harris has prescribed antibiotic dosages that may
leave many people suffering from nerve damage or other illnesses. The correct
human dose of tetracycline is 250 to at most 500 milligrams per day for ten
to fourteen days. One gentleman personally informed me he was instructed by
Mr. Harris to take three times that dose for a month--clearly a toxic
prescription. 

2) Mr. Harris has been called by some "a fraud" and others an "expert
scientist." Wherein lies the truth?

Months ago I was sent Mr. Harris's resume' along with portions of his book. I
was unimpressed. The many spelling and grammatical errors found clearly
reflected an
educational and professional deficit. I'm reminded of the phrase "real men
don't eat quiche." Real scientists know their publications, particularly
their curriculum vitaes,
are a measure of their professional integrity.  Legitimate scientists would
be aghast to have such a mistake-laden reflection of their work circulating.

Likewise, the poor content in Mr. Harris's audio and video presentations, as
discussed below, reflects a possibly sincere laboratory technician, and
superficially
credited microbiologist, but not a highly or even well-credentialed man of
science, health, or bioweapons research.

3) Mr. Harris alleges to have been a CIA agent with CDC bioweapons laboratory
experience. CIA agents have been known to be notoriously unreliable and
sources of
counterintelligence propaganda. If Mr. Harris's connections to the CIA are
true, and I don't doubt Mr. Harris's sincerity in believing his reports and
CIA connections are, then given the nature of his information, and the
social/political context in which it is being disseminated, I must conclude
Mr. Harris is being used by elements within the CIA as a counterintelligence
propagandist.

Case in point, weeks ago when Associated Press announced Mr. Harris's guilty
plea to fraud charges, it was predictable this would further endear Mr.
Harris in the hearts and minds of many people on the political right and well
as anti-government groups. It was likewise predictable Mr. Harris would then
be additionally useful in discrediting
certain "fringe" elements who favored him or his arbitrary health and safety
prescriptions. As the attachments show, this has all come to pass.

Regardless of Mr. Harris's personal intent, he is now functioning as a tool
for propagandists, and the public should be forewarned.

4) Mr. Harris recently pleaded guilty of fraud in a plea bargain regarding
the illegal storage and transportation of pathogenic microorganisms. Had Mr.
Harris been a legitimate scientist, he might have arranged to have his
experimental material
shipped more safely and legally.

5) The story of Mr. Harris's friend "Miriam," a Muslim woman who, along with
alleged allied terrorists, are preparing to release bioweapons on American
populations, entirely self-incriminates Mr. Harris.

First, this story is consistent with another CIA affiliate and government
propagandist, best selling author Tom Clancy who, in his recent book,
presented the same thesis as Harris.

Next, Mr. Harris's expressed personal knowledge of "Miriam" includes granting
her a three-day head start to "get away" from federal authorities. If this
were true, then Mr. Harris would be guilty of treason, and aiding and
abetting in a conspiracy that, according to Harris, may kill well over 150
million Americans. Is it reasonable to give trust to a man who gives such a
terrorist three days to escape thus jeopardizing the continent of North
America and beyond?

Furthermore, as advanced by pharmacist, attorney and biowarfare researcher
Lawrence Joyce in "Lessons From Dugway" [(773) 286-7986], it would be counter
intelligent for Muslim terrorists to perform as Mr. Harris alleged. In
Joyce's well considered words, "you can get more bang for the buck by getting
the world's
largest economic and military power to concede to your demands than you can
by destroying it. After all, you can't control and manipulate dead people,
and you gain
no power by gaining control over a wrecked economy; you gain power by
dictating the course of the lives of people who are part of a strong economy.
The tail will
always jump at the chance to wag the dog."

Joyce details additional reasons why a Harris scenario is counterproductive
and unlikely for terrorist organizations. Moreover, common sense would tell
you that even Muslim hate/extremist groups would not be inclined to attack
urban areas of the U.S. wherein the vast majority of their support emanates.

My research indicates Americans, and others worldwide, are at far greater
risk of bioweapons attack by a rogue element within our own CIA than from
anyone else.
This must be understood in light of America's principle national security
interest (and clearly articulated motive) -- population control, the
purveyors of which now focus on reducing the U.S. population by approximately
125 million, and they have the means
to do it.

The world's leading biotechnology laboratories and chemical and biological
weapons (CBW) contracting firms are ours, including institutions such as
Merck, Sharp &
Dohme, Litton Industries, Dow Chemical, and others.

As documented in "Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola -- Nature, Accident or
Intentional?" [Toll free (888)-508-4787], the insidious nature and
international extent of the military-medical-industrial bioweapons complex is
shocking to say the least.

It should be recalled that the Bush administration supplied Sadam Hussein
with military and biological armaments up until two weeks before our vets,
now many ailing from Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), invaded Kuwait. U.S. Government
celebrated and promulgated vaccines, some produced by Tannox Biomedical
Systems, co-owned by Bush's Secretary of State James Baker III, continue to
plague our vets
and jeopardize the public's health while federal authorities turn a blind eye
to the true hazards of deadly vaccine contaminations being given even today
to America's children.

Thus, Mr. Harris's and other propagandists' blaming political enemies, and
the victims of biological attacks (as was recently the case when parents were
blamed for
not getting their children vaccinated in lieu of a hepatitis A outbreak
associated with U.S. Government produced and distributed contaminated
desserts, or decades ago
gay men and Black Africans were blamed for initiating the AIDS epidemic, when
contaminated vaccines were more plausibly the cause) is convenient chicanery,
insulting to all who see through the ruse. Unfortunately, too few do.

And with more and more conflicting messages being passed by people like Mr.
Harris, or his handlers, it becomes harder and harder to see the forest of
legitimate threat through the trees of disinformation and counterintelligence
propaganda.

6) Mr. Harris has also endorsed certain antibiotics, including colloidal
silver, and certain manufacturers and distributors of these products. I
believe that this is a questionable and perhaps unethical practice. Though I
too favor proven safe and
effective doses of alternative therapies for specific illnesses,  I have yet
to read one convincing scientific report to substantiate Mr. Harris's claims
regarding colloidal silver as a universal antibiotic and antiviral. Clearly
more research needs to be done
in this area.

In one advertisement on short wave, Mr. Harris was said to have found
colloidal silver effective against 600 different types of microorganisms. By
1970, the World Health Organization and domestic biological weapons
establishment had "isolated" more than 70,000 different strains of viruses
alone. Moreover, Mr. Harris's promoters have recommended daily use of this
antibiotic without citing its undesirable effects on the
normal intestinal flora. All of this at the time the FDA -- America's medical
mafia -- is treatening to regulate colloidal silver and other potentially
useful, low risk and cost alternatives to expensive and toxic, but patentable
pharmaceuticals.

Here again, Mr. Harris is playing right into the hands of our shadow
governors, pharmaceutical industry barons,  and their propagandists.

In concluding my remarks re: Larry Harris, I would urge caution in matters
concerning public health and biological warfare as articulated by him. He may
well be, as he claims to have been, an agent for the CIA, though much of his
information
appears to be counter intelligent in nature.

I have no doubt that we will have increasing numbers of small to medium size
outbreaks of infectious microorganisms like E. coli 157, flesh eating
bacteria, meningococci, new viruses like AIDS, Ebola, Hanta, hepatitis C, and
others that CIA
bioweapons contractors investigated (if not developed), and further
dispersed, during and after "Project: MKNAOMI," that are now associated with
widespread illness. These outbreaks will parallel rising mortality rates from
virus-linked soft tissue cancers, including prostate, breast, and lymphomas,
and from increasingly common exposures to various chemical and environmental
pollutants and manmade toxins. Some, if not most of these exposures will be
intentionally and covertly administered
such as the recent CBS News televised spraying of the human carcinogen
malathion (and possibly additional toxins) from black helicopters over South
Florida and Miami beach (allegedly to counter a fruit fly infestation). Such
activities and exposures may well serve a clearly articulated and well
documented population control agenda now targeting the United States
population as others have been targeted in years past.

Moreover, the mainstream news media will continue to ignore, and in many
cases, obscure the facts.

The new terror fear: biological weapons
>>Detecting an attack is just the first problem
>><GRAPHICS/x31918.cap>
>>
>>BY NICHOLAS HORROCK
>>
>>America is stepping up preparations to cope with biological warfare. This
month, at undisclosed locations in Denver, medical and weapons experts will
begin to assess the city's ability to contend with terrorists using
biological, radiological, or chemical weapons of mass destruction. Denver
is the first of 120 cities where federal authorities will evaluate
emergency capabilities under a $42.6 million Domestic Preparedness Program
that is the largest civil defense initiative since the Cold War. This
program begins two weeks after the Pentagon granted the first contract in a
possible $400 million program to develop a detection system to sniff out
deadly airborne microbes spread by an enemy.
>>
>>Three events have created the new urgency: Iraq deployed missiles bearing
anthrax germs, botulinum (a toxin that spreads the deadly disease
botulism), and aflatoxin (a poison derived from mold) during the 1991
Persian Gulf war, and its biological weapons program continues, according
to intelligence experts; a 1995 Tokyo attack in which the cultlike
terrorist group Aum spread nerve gas in the subway system killing 12
people; and a little publicized conviction in Ohio last month of a
microbiologist named Larry Wayne Harris, who pleaded guilty to fraudulently
obtaining bubonic plague cultures. Harris, who has ties to right-wing
groups, was sentenced to 18 months probation and community service. The
plague cultures were obtained by Harris with such ease that in 1996
Congress tightened laws on commerce in deadly biological materials to make
sure they were ordered for legitimate medical and scientific purposes.
>>
>>Poor man's nukes. The CIA now says Iraq has been joined by North Korea,
Iran, Libya, Syria, and even China in the quest to make biological weapons.
Their motive is simple: Biologicals are cheaper and easier to make than
nuclear or chemical weapons, and they can be equally as devastating. The
U.S. Office of Technology Assessment once estimated that a small private
plane, with 220 pounds of anthrax spores, flying over Washington on a
clear, windless night, could trail an invisible, odorless mist that would
kill between 1 million and 3 million people.
>>
>>However, retired Army Col. Karl Lowe, an arms-control expert, argued in a
recent essay that it would be very hard for terrorists to carry off a
biological attack. Many biologicals can be dissipated by wind or rain, or
must be ingested in such enormous amounts as to make their use as a weapon
of mass destruction impossible.
>>
>>Though difficult to execute, a biological attack would be virtually
impossible to detect in its early stages. "Ideally we would like to develop
a detection system using something remote, like a laser beam that could
detect and identify a biological agent at standoff distances," says
Assistant Defense Secretary Harold Smith. But that prospect is years away,
so the Pentagon is trying to develop a "point detector" that could be
mounted on a remote-controlled vehicle. It should be able to sniff air
samples and determine within 15 minutes whether any of 26 dangerous agents
are present, according to Brig. Gen. John Doesburg, whose command awarded
the first contract for such a vehicle last month.
>>
>>The best detector now is a Humvee mounted with what appears to be a small
Hansel and Gretel house with three chimneys, named in the Army's cumbersome
fashion the Biological Integrated Detection System, or BIDS. The problem
with BIDS is that it takes two persons to operate, requires 30 to 45
minutes to identify biological agents (an eternity in combat), and can
simultaneously identify only four. Next year, DOD will field a temporary
improvement, the Air Base/Port Biological Detection system, at bases in two
areas of high tension, like South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
>>
>>On the civilian side, a law passed last year requires DOD to go beyond
troop protection and assist in civil defense. An incident in Washington,
DC, last month added urgency to the effort. The headquarters of the B'nai
B'rith, the national Jewish service organization, received a package with a
threatening note and the laboratory words for anthrax on it. It turned out
to be harmless, but had anthrax been loose in Washington's downtown, U.S.
readiness would have faced the supreme  test.

Subject: Update On Larry Wayne Harris - Direct From The "Horse's Mouth"

I logged off the internet at 2:30 am and logged back on at 6:30.  I had about
20 messages, most of whom had to do with Mr.Harris.  I read them all quickly
and then had to take my wife to the airport.

On the way back, I called Mr. Harris and confronted him with the allegations
raised by the Medical Corps and the Montana Militia.

Here is what he told me:

1.  The Medical Corps consists of a single former medical corpman with
absolutely no credentials other than his military training.  He makes his
living selling used Army manuals to the militias.

2.  The Montana Militia issued their statement based solely on the basis of
information they received from the "Medical Corps".   They knew him
apparently from manual deals in the past.  BTW, did you notice the thinly
veiled threats in the MM information?

3.  Mr. Harris is forwarding me the phone numbers of a group of scientists,
doctors, etc.  which can back up his dosage recommendations.  I will check
these out and get back to you with further information.

4.  The dosage recommendations of the "Medical Corps" will be insufficient to
fight off the disease and people could die from undermedication as opposed to
statements of the "Medical Corps" that people would die from overmedication
if they followed Mr. Harris' recommendations.

I think at this point, it is well established that Mr. Harris is an expert in
this area  (Remember that the original disinformation was that he was a
septic tank inspector and that he had no lab).

I think if the above information is correct, there can be no reliance placed
on the statements of the Medical Group and Montana Militia statements based
on information received from the Medical group.

I think it is also clear that something is wrong with the statements about
the charges against him which have appeared in various e-mails.   If he
really had gotten these biological agents and had no legitimate use for them,
do you think he would be walking around now?  (Yes, I used the wrong term
(Blue Law) but I think it was clear what I was talking about.)

It is clear from former Ex-Senator Nunn's statements that it was not a matter
of
"if" an attack would occur, it was only a matter of when.  Therefore, this is
not a matter of whether or not the threat is real.  IT IS.  The only question
is WHEN the attack will occur.  My point has been from the beginning that we
should get ready NOW.  Then if the attack is later, we will still be
prepared.

I am not sure I mentioned this earlier, but among items faxed by Mr. Harris
is a copy of a fax to the Governor of Arizona regarding Marshall Law
exercises about to be conducted in Phoenix.  It also indicates that these
exercises are about to be declared in several other states.  There also was a
press release indicating that on May 28th a convoy of 100 trucks, etc. were
deployed to Phoenix.

He also sent a copy of a document entitled "The Economic Impact Of A
Bioterrorist Attack:  Are Prevention and Postattack Intervention Programs
Justifiable.  This report was issued in the Spring Quarter 1997 issue of
Emerging Infectious Diseases and were written by three people from the CDC.

I also received an e-mail stating that this possible attack could not be real
because we would have no warning if it was real.   I totally disagree.  The
information was not released by the parties involved but was discovered
through various incidents.  There is no absolutely no guarantee that this
will happen.  However, the probability  IMHO is high.  I would rather have
egg on my face than anthrax up my nose.  Note that there has been massive and
instantaneous disinformation.  If this was purposefully planted or sent, you
can only conclude that someone is trying to confuse us and get us to stop
paying attention to this issue.

I also want to make it perfectly clear that I do not think that the Iranians
/ Iraqis / Etc.  are in this alone.  They were either intentionally provoked
by the Conspiracy or they have recruited these people to do their dirty work.
 One thing is clear.  There HAS to be a reason why those people hate us so
much.  That reason has NEVER been fully covered in the media.

I hope this helps you sort out fact from fiction.
