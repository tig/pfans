Tom,

I've been running the Electromotive HPV-I system on my MB 190E 2.3-16 turbo.
 It's done very well.  I've replaced the sensor once in two years and 15000
miles.  Not knowing the problem when the sensor failed, I flooded the
cylinders trying to start it.  Afterwards, with the new sensor and the plugs
cleaned, it did good.  However the plugs were pretty badly fowled and the
boost pressure was slow to rise so I knew the plugs had loaded up and were
too far gone.  I replaced the plugs it's running excellent again!

Another example, a Porsche that I know of with dual HPV-I and running
Webbers. As far as I know it's never had any trouble.

On the other hand the MSD system is more affordable and you'll probably see
similar results. But the advantage of the Electromotive is the adjustability
factor.  You can set the timing at 3 different levels of RPM.  You can retard
the timing on the top end.  And you can set the total timing to with-in a
half a degree with the crank pulley pick-up.

And finally, if I could do it again I'd go directly for the TEC-II.  The
higher level of Electromotive.  Fully programable for roughly $2500 depending
on the car/application.

Hope this helps,

Zane

PS. My Mercedes 190E 2.3-16 turbo is for sale.  The engine is very well
developed (278 hp w/8 psi) and performance is as good as a tweeked 944 Turbo.
 The car also has the Evolution II body-work.  It needs a good home where it
will be driven and enjoyed.
