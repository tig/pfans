	Bob, you suck. I don't know how we got on your list, but we'd
	like to unsubscribe from you. You're ugly and a jerk to boot.
	We don't know how we got on your list but we want off.
	We did all that unsubscribe crap but we're still stuck reading
	your messages. You don't work right and we're tired of you.
	Please take us off your email list.
