Hank Watts and Andy Warren have been worrying at the issue of just why 
it's better to brake hard and short, rather than long and light.  I won't 
repeat the whole discussion here, but I think I have a view that will 
help illuminate things:

The real issue here is not the temperature of the rotor, but the temp. of 
the caliper, since that's where the fluid is, and it's the temperature of 
the fluid that really matters.  Radiant and convective heat transfer from 
the rotor to the caliper is probably not significant compared to direct 
heating of the pads, so we'll leave it out for now

When you brake, you're generating heat at the pad/rotor interface.  This
heat has to go somewhere (you want it to go away from the calipers). 
The rotor is metal (a good heat conductor, with a lot of heat carrying
capacity per gram), and a big hunk of metal at that, so a lot of the
heat will end up there.  The pads are relatively small, and relatively
poor conductors of heat (heat moves through them slowly), and they are 
made of stuff with a low heat capacity, so even if they get hot, there's 
not a lot of hot there.  The caliper is another big hunk of metal, but 
it's separated from the heat generation by the insulating bulk of the 
pad.

I'm assuming (correctly?  I think mostly) that up to a point, 
the pad/rotor interface doesn't really care how hot things get, so you 
can keep dumping heat into the rotor without greatly reducing your 
available braking.  On the other hand, the caliper/fluid system is real 
picky about temperature....

So we're looking at a system with a big heat sink (the rotor), an 
insulator (the pads) and another heat sink (the caliper).  The objective 
is to keep the heat in the rotor, and away from the caliper.  This is why 
you have big THICK rotors and ceramic-backed pads--lots of mass to store 
heat, and more insulation between that heat and the sensitive caliper.  
Big calipers are also helpful, since that's more mass in which to 
disperse any heat that does get to the caliper.

Now here's the important part:  Since most of the heat is in the rotor,
the only time you're heating the calipers is when the pads are in
contact with the rotors.  As soon as you let off the brakes, you've
isolated the caliper from the rotor (except for radiant/convective heat
transfer, which is much less effective than direct transfer).

So now we finally get to braking strategy.  If you brake long and 
lightly, the pads are in contact with the hot rotors longer, and more of 
the heat generated flows through the pads to the calipers.  If you do it 
quick and hard, the pads don't have time to cook the calipers.

OK, I think that was long-winded enough.  

Here's a metaphoric way to look at it:  You're thinking about heat moving 
away from the pad/rotor interface.  You want it to move toward the 
rotors.  You've got a sewer pipe between the interface and the rotor, 
and a garden hose between the interface and the caliper (the pad, which 
is an insulator).  The less time you spend with the garden hose hooked 
up, the better off you are.
