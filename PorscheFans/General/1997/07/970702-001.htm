It seems to me there was a thread a while ago about removing adhesives from
various places on our cars. I got a terrific tip, tried it and it works! If
you know of anyone in the medical/health care profession ask them if they can
get you PDI pads-Adhesive Tape Remover Pads. Apparently emergency rooms,
clinics and those type of facilities use these pads routinely to ease the
pain involved in removing bandages. My tipster works in a childrens hospital
and knew that these pads work-on the tender skin of children. 
I was checking out the door sills for rust; I pulled the rubber strip that
protects the sills and discovered a layer of adhesives which I needed to
remove in order to inspect for rust. I was getting nowhere fast untill I got
a bunch of these pads. They are small-look like those hand wipes-but smaller.
But they did remove all that old adhesive stuff. Next, I tried them on old
adhesives left over from balancing tires-on the inside. The adhesives
dissolved before my eyes. These pads are Cat No B16400 and are made by
Professional Disposables, Inc of Orangeburg, NY 10962-1376 and Mississauga,
Ontario L4T 1G5.
Be advised I have used them twice and have no indication that the paint under
the adhesives was damaged or negatively affected. No one, however, that I
know of has used these pads for an automotive application other than myself.
Be forwarned that I simply wanted to share this-standard disclaimers.
