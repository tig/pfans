As I recall several 911 owners on the list have installed the
Electromotive crank fired distributorless ignition system (HPV-1).  I'm
looking for feedback on the advantages/disadvantages of this system for a
non Pcar hot street V-6 application running Webers.

One of the local independent Porsche shops here in the Seattle area says
the magnetic sensors fail quite frequently and that he buys them 10 at a
time.  Other than that the system makes better power than stock on his
twin-plug engines.

Another shop says the sensor failures are a thing of the past and the
units are very reliable, but that the units won't clear a fouled plug.  =
On
engines running Weber carbs you have to be very careful in your starting
procedure or you can foul a plug.

The technical benefits of a crank fired distributorless ignition sound
impressive on paper, but I'm wondering whether there are any real world
benefits that owners have seen.  The units don't look all that swift in
construction quality compared to most mass marketed ignition systems such
as MSD, Crane, etc, especially for $469.  I guess this is secondary if =
the
units actually work as advertised, which would be a rarity these days.
I've heard hot 911s with the Electromotive system on the track and they =
do
sound sweet.

Thanks for any info on performance and reliability.
