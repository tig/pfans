Hi Porsche Fans,

It has been a while since I have spoken up, but we have a "situation" here in
California that cannot be ignored.

There is a bill SB 42, regarding automobiles over 25 years of age, that went
to committe and was suspended. Which is not good news for classic cars
owners. 

I need the help of Californians to contact your State Senator and
Representative and anyone you can think of to help us out the "fire" back
into this bill. Time is of the essence, we only have until the end of this
month to unsuspend the bill.

Here are the Web Sites where you can:
a) Get information on SB 42
b) Contact your State Senator
c) Contact your State Assembly Representative.

If you would like to see SB 42 Bill Analysis, you can do this one of two
ways:

1) Go to: California Senate bill SB 42 - Air Pollution Bill

http://www.sen.ca.gov/htbin/ca-billpage/SB/42/GOPHER_ROOT2:[BILL.CURRENT.SB.FR
OM0000.SB0042]

2) Contact me and I will forward the contents of the analysis which is
downlaodable from the Web Site.

Thank you in advance for your help and I apologize to the Non-Californians
for the bandwidth.

Regards
