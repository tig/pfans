while i certainly appreciate captain chaos' frustration and desire to 
punish bobzar@aol.com, i wanted to point out a something:

people can be subscribed to this list without their consent.  so, 
regardless of whether or not bobzar originally signed up himself, it's 
possible that he has been resubscribed against his will.

if you've followed the thread from the beginning, he simply wants off 
the list.  if i was feeling malicious, it'd be very easy to simply 
resubscribe him as "punishment" for making snide remarks to begin with.  
then he tries to unsub, and somebody else who's been miffed decides to 
resub him.  and the circle continues.  the best thing (IMHO) would be 
for bobzar to simply ignore the p-fans mails for a week or so then try 
to unsub via the proper channels (either web or email) and for everybody 
else to remain level-headed and wait for this to blow over.  if you're 
lucky enough to be checking this list using something other than hotmail 
(such as eudora, etc.) set up a filter and you'll miss all the bobzar 
posts.  in a few weeks you can kill the filter and (hopefully) 
everything will be back to normal.

just my 2 cents :-)
