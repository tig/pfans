Subj:	Re: Part 1, CHEMOTHERAPY: Deadly Cancer Treatment Yields Lively Profits

WHO CARES?

 Nobel Laureate, Paul Samuelson describes the
Federal Reserve as an "Omnipotent Counterfeiter"
in his textbook:   ECONOMICS, FOURTH EDITION

With healthy counterfeit being of paramount 
importance to healthy people, the Fed published
a booklet titled KEEPING OUR MONEY HEALTHY
where they said their system "works only with credit"
(making the payments of debts and taxes illusions)
and they said their unlimited counterfeit would keep
its value "if there were fewer people bidding against
each other".

Cancer and AIDS leave fewer people to bid.    IRS
gets the counterfeit out of circulation to prevent
our bidding it for our own production.   

If we were permitted to spend all of the counterfeit
that we get, consumption would exceed production
and their system would collapse. Collapsing faster than it is now.  We'd be
free!!

The suppression of a cure for cancer has NOTHING
to do with the profits in treating cancer,  it is all a
matter of population control.  Former Secretary of
Defense, Robert McNamara said: "There are many
ways to make the death rate increase".

Who will bother to understand and pass this on?

Merrill M.E. Jenkins (1919-1979) was the first Monetary
Realist.  He wrote 7 books on this subject. He invented
the currency changer.  Where "money experts" write
without definitions, they contradict themselves, Jenkins
defined his terms.  Send PO address for catalog.
