Sorry for the longish quote, and for mail from somebody not actually on
the Porsche mailing list. My wife (Laurie) asked me (Rusty, rgs@rgs.com)
to take a look at this message, and asked me to respond. I'm responding on
her account, with her permission, since I'm not subscribed.

I have to absolutely disagree with you here, an IPX can easily handle a
2000 user mailing list, and without breaking a sweat even. I know this
because I use an IPC (which is an IPX without the integrated GX graphics
card) at work to serve a 950 member mailing list, a web site, an irc
server, and (in its spare time) works as my workstation to do work related
functions.

Close, mine at work has three banks of 4 meg sticks installed, for a maximum
of 48 megs. Yes, it gets very swap bound, but it's still usuable. It just
takes a few seconds to "wake up" in the morning, since I re-index the entire
web site every night for the search engine database.

What software were you using to sevice your list? I'm using Listproc 6.0c,
and it has no problems at all. Listproc forks off multiple sendmails, and
batches users together for faster delivery. I have my batch size set fairly
low (5 users per sendmail), which increases machine load but improves
message latency.

My list is currently 90% digest readers, so obviously if the Porsche lists
are more like 90% non-digest your mileage may differ there. But honestly, it
only takes 5 minutes to send out the 800+ messages (in 160 individual
sendmails) even when a digest goes out. Digests go out every 500+ lines
of text (typically 10-15 messages for my users), and normally I process
from 2 to 8 digests a day. One time, (owing to a stupid user) I ended up
processing 3 digests of input in a half our period, the machine had no real
trouble keeping up with sending out the messages (although it wasn't much
good for anything else at the time).

The largest single load on the machine when mail comes in is that I archive
every message in a monthly indexed HTML file for the web server. The index
towards the end of the month grows into the 200+KB range, and an IPC running
perl is not a pretty sight. That my AOL users like to flash upload 4-6
messages in a 15 second period doesn't help. But the machine still handles
it.

If the machine were just running a mail server I don't think it would ever
really get loaded up.

I believe MajorDomo (and it's been years since I researched this, so I may
have the name wrong) has added multiple sendmail support recently (like,
in the three years since I looked into it). It used to hand everything off
to a single sendmail invocation, and that was pretty bad on big lists, as
you say.

I'll admit I'm using a T-1, so it's not quite the same. But I've checked
when I'm sending digests out, and the link is a long way from the bottle
neck. I think I average a few hundred kbps if I remember correctly, and
increasing the batch size could easily reduce the time I'm doing high
bandwidth. And if you're ISDN has data compression (my home machine
uses Ascend gear, with STAC compression) I don't think bandwidth would
be a problem at all. Text e-mail is rather compressable.
