DON'T SHOW FAVORITISM                      Monday - July 21, 1997
                              	=09
"Then Peter began to speak: "I now realize how true it is that God does n=
ot
show favoritism  but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do wh=
at
is right." - Acts 10:34-35

Shortly after the Civil War, an ex-slave entered a fashionable church in
Lexington, Virginia one Sunday to attend the service.  As he approached t=
he
altar for communion, a rustle of shock and anger went through the
congregation.  A distinguished white layman immediately stood up and knel=
t
beside the black man.  The congregation was moved and soon turned to the
spirit of impartiality.  The older layman was former Confederate General
Robert E. Lee.

Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, recently said that "A simple "color
blind" test - a test that rules out race-consciousness across the board -
will not work." =20

It is only in Christ, with the Spirit of the Lord working in our lives,
that we can prevent showing favoritism, whether it be racism, sexism or a=
ny
other "-ism" that seeks to divide the church body.
Today in prayer, pray through today's verse above and the verses below th=
at
state the Lord does not show favoritism.  Ask Him to help you overcome an=
y
partiality in your own life.

God's Word: "My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ,
don't show favoritism." - James 2:1

"For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God,
mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.  He
defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien,
giving him food and clothing." - Deuteronomy 10:17-18 =20

"Now let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Judge carefully, for with the
LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery." - 2
Chronicles 19:7

"For God does not show favoritism." - Romans 2:11
=20
"Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no
favoritism." - Colossians 3:25

"Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live
your lives as strangers here in reverent fear." - 1 Peter 1:17    =20
