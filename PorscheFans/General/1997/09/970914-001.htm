Like many, I eagerly await the publication of the first in-depth reports on
new Porsches.

Thus when I received the Oct/Nov 1997 issue of Sports Car International
yesterday with the photo of the red Twin Turbo emblazoned on the cover under
the banner "VROOOOM!" and header announcing " FIRST DRIVE! Porsche's All-New
911", I thought I was in for a real treat!

I'm always amazed (and perhaps envious) of the expertise of these jet-setting
Road Warriors who know every aspect from NASCAR corner balancing to Michael
Schumacher's lastest techniques for F1 chassis setup at Spa; as well as the
opportunity to drive with abandon (unfettered by the financial cares of most
mortals) the latest exotic offerings in gorgeous locales.

Like some of the "tonier" publications, this magazine does not "clutter" the
article with the author's name, but after seeing in the Table of Contents it
was "Ian" Something I felt reassured with the ingrained image of european
competence.

The excellent all view photos of the blue 996 with it's Stuttgart plates
sitting in a field of sunflowers only whetted my appetite for the
journalistic insights to come.

After starting off with some of the "preliminaries" (drag coefficient,
windshield rake, etc) that I'd already seen before, the author reaffirmed his
credentials for the unwashed with "Porsche has plenty of experience with
water-cooling...The 956 and 962 race engines ran water-cooled heads...".

The next paragraph began: "Existing 911 owners who shudder every time they
flush out 16-plus quarts of expensive Mobil One synthetic oil will be pleased
to know that the new dry sump arrangement is full with only 10.8 quarts and
an oil change requires just 8.7 quarts".

16 QUARTS!!!!!!! (I readily admit that one of the qreatest inner secrets of
Porschedom is the oil capacity of dry sump production boxer engines with
reservoir, but 16 quarts means our friendly informant is adding 4-6 quarts,
perhaps for "weight and balance" to the windshield washer reservoir).

My faith "shattered", I read on lacking comphrension at other statements in
the article like "A standard, untweaked 3.6-litre 911 motor has a feeling of
greater internal inertia and more strain over 5000 rpm"...does he mean the
old air-cooled normally aspirated engines were "constipated"?

The article concludes with the "obligatory" comments that this newest 911 is
"the most complete, mature, and elegant 911...".  I wonder if this guy??
really attended the technical briefings or just grabbed the press package,
ate the free lunches, and took an extra case of Dinkel Aker to test the rear
"seating area" during the "First Drive" portion.

Perhaps I expect too much and don't understand the pressures of publication
deadlines (first on the newstand...), but I often feel that I've been
sideswiped in the tunnel of automotive lore by the Paparazzi of Print!
