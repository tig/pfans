Mike:

From your description, it sounds like clay... You spray your "clean"
paint with a lubricant (detailing spray works fine, or you can just
wash your car and leave the surface wet and soapy), then take a lump
of the clay, flatten it into a pancake, and rub it across the paint
to remove road film and other impurities.

The advertisement you saw may have been for Griot's Garage... You
can order clay from them (tel: 800 345-5789) and pay their outrageous
prices, or you can get it much cheaper from any automotive-paint
supply store.

On the offchance that your local paint shop doesn't carry it, you can
call one of the clay manufacturers and get the name of a local
distributor... These days, I'm using clay manufactured by Oltra
Corporation; their number is 800 249-4929 (and their part number for
the 100-gram lump of clay, if it helps, is 814114).
