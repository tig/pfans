A dyno can be dialed up to read whatever you feel like.  With a calibrated
brake, it's possible to get consistent readings, but the base reference is
the issue.  If Porsche is conservative, no surprise, but if the car is
generating 400hp at the rear wheels, that's amazing, since it's only rated
at the flywheel.  I presume a modest, single digit percentage energy loss
in the drive train.  Thus, 430hp at the wheels is not likely.  Then again,
I see very few companies advertising their ability to even dyno a Turbo or
C4S.  Sure it can be done, but I'm not clear on the details or the
calculation or especially if anyone really believes the numbers (speaking
of DIN and the engineering associations.)  If we have a knowledgeable
engineer in our midst, I'd very much like to understand the process for
putting four driven wheels on a dyno.
