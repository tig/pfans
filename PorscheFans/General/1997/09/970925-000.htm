I recently bought a '68 912 with about 10,000 miles on the rebuilt and bored
engine, and then had the engine fully tuned (new plugs, carbs & valves
adjusted, distributor components replaced, engine timed) to have it perform
well at the 6,200-foot elevation where I live.  The engine runs okay but
could run more smoothly, and it seems to take between 3 and 6 seconds to
start after repeated pumping of the accelerator (i.e., it doesn't start up
immediately).  Is this normal for this make/model?  Also, other than
replacing the twin Solex carbs with Webers (which I've been told by several
mechanics would be a good idea), what other COST-EFFECTIVE things can I do to
maximize engine performance?
