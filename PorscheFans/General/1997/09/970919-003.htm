    NEW YORK, Sept. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche is the first automobile

the classic 911 and new Boxster models, Porsche was chosen one of The Fashion
Group International's Masters of Design.
          "Porsche has endeavored to play a special role in the ever changing
design
process," commented Mr. Harm Lagaay, Chief Designer of the Porsche Design
Studio in accepting the award, "a role in which its design philosophy always
remains clear and consistent.  Therefore, our cars have a strong identity and
character.  Whatever models we create are perceived as unmistakably Porsche."
          Other recipients of the prestigious award this year were fashion
trend
setters John Galliano, Francois Lesage, Antonio Ratti, Yohji Yamamoto, Peter
Marion and Karl Lagerfeld.
