I believe I'm not a collect, but I would love to find somewhere about the
Bay Area with a decent collection of Porsche stuff.  I've heard of one
place (near Walnut Creek?) and obviously the local dealer has a range.

Any URLs or RRLs will be well appreciated.

I also appreciate seeing the 'Tequipment' catalogue (in English, please)
and I'd be happy to offer a scanning service if someone wants it up on a
web site (I can't provide the site.)

Cheers

Adam
ps. "RRL=reality resource locator" aka telephone, fax and street address.
