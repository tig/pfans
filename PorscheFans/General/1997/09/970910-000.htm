Hi, William.

A year and a half ago, I was looking at 850s, too... I was getting
tired of commuting to work in my 914/6 and wanted a car that was
sorta fast and nice looking, yet more comfortable than my car and 
available for under $50K.

I'd driven a friend's 850, and while it wasn't as fast as the 914,
it WAS "sorta fast" and it DID look real nice, so I started
seriously looking for one.

After test-driving a few and finding myself TOTALLY underwhelmed by
their lack of power, I discovered a small detail:  My friend's car
was actually an 850CSi, and the cars I'd been test-driving were all
regular 850i's... Compared to the CSi, they were REALLY slow.  Also, 
every 850i I found had an automatic transmission... Yuck.

Now that I knew I wanted an 850CSi, I started looking again... And
found that the CSi's are a lot rarer than the regular 850i's, and
they cost a LOT more... Fifty percent or more above the cost of an
850i.

So I bought an Acura NSX... And I have no regrets whatsoever.  The
NSX is faster than even the 850CSi, it FEELS a lot more agile, it's
just as comfortable and luxurious, and although I personally don't
think it's as attractive as an 850, it does seem to turn heads.

Mine's a '94, but I only chose that year because they made a handful
of dark green hardtops that year... Aside from color choices, the
'91-'93 cars are virtually identical to it, and these days, you can
pick up a '91 NSX with relatively low miles for arund $35-$40K.

Test-drive an NSX and see if you still want an 850... I have a 
feeling that you won't.

-Andy

P.S.  A past president of the local BMWCCA chapter owns an NSX...
      You may want to ask his opinions, too, since he knows a LOT
      more about the 850s than I do.  His name's Dan Tackett; you can
      reach him at tackman@adnc.com.

P.P.S.  And if you STILL want an 850I after all that, I have another 
        friend who's half-heartedly looking to sell his.  It's
        white, low miles, with an automatic transmission.  If you're
        serious, I can put the two of you together... Let me know.
