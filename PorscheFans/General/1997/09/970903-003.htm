I have tried this stuff out (paint cleaning clay), from Griot's Garage.  I am
definitely sold on it.  Have not used any other brand.

It takes some practice to use it well, but the instructions with it (as well as
in the Griot's catalog) are complete and work well.  It is the least difficult
step of a full wax job (well, maybe except for the washing).  The effect of the
clay is that it is somehow, through its stickiness I guess, able to grab the
very fine junk lodged in the paint that would otherwise require much elbow
grease and/or abrasive polishes to remove.  It leaves the paint surface ultra
smooth.  It's supposed to be used before each waxing (or polishing if needed). 
It adds maybe 20-30 minutes to a full wax job, and less if you get real
efficient at it.

I practiced on the 2 non-P cars before the 911, mainly to build technique. 
(Don't get the wrong idea; as long as the paint and clay are clean and you use
enough lubricant, the downside is you get some clay stuck on the paint which
takes a little polish or just rubbing with a clean soft cloth to get off -- not
a big deal.)

Summary: very highly recommended.
