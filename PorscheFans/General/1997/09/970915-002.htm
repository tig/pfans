True, the 993 will be on sale for some time and the factory delivers
various incarnations (and output levels) from the car.  I'm not arguing
about the relative vehicle performance of various normally aspirated six
cylinder engines -- it's just the insanity of bringing the new car to
market with any kind of deficit, especially such a simple thing as
horsepower.  I know they say that the car is marginally faster than the old
car by virtue of a few horses and a few less pounds, but on paper it's
missing easy points on comparison.

In any market that values measurable performance as a benefit (not just a
feature) there will always be "leap frogging."  As the various engine
builders release new ponies with better legs; it's the responsibility of
each manufacturer to bring out the next increment with the next car.  Thus,
Porsche is committing a terrible disservice to the marketability of the car
by letting it fall off the performance curve.

BTW, I just picked up the first US mag with a 996 review -- it's three
pages of 'soft' compliments and motherhood.  For whatever reason, they fail
to make any real assessment of the car, they just report the facts and
figures without real comment other than to say it's a better handling car
in terms of being less threatening and less frightening to an average
driver overstepping their limitations.  Good grief.

What sense is there in shelving the 993?  It's the best quality of
manufacture Porsche has ever delivered (thanks to Toyota as I recall for
rejuvenating their production line) and they can't build any given model as
quickly as it sells -- even with the Boxster eating out some of the
potential low end Carrera purchases (and the Carrera S is a simple and
elegant proposition to bring those buyers back) Porsche is selling the 993
like hot cakes.  Just try to take delivery of a C4S or Twin Turbo without a
months' delay or more.

I can't say just how disappointed I am to think that 'my' car, the car that
I have admired for as long as I've had enough sense to admire it, is once
more with a foot in the grave.  Porsche did this once before and somehow
they were whipped into sense and brought the car back -- can they recover
this time?
