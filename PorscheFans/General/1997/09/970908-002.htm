It does enhance the appearance of snobbishness of the club.

I can see a certain amount of 'event quality control' in preventing
non-Porsche owners from participating in the driving events. My local BMW
CCA chapter newsletter recently described one of their events where, as I
remember, only one of the cars participating was a BMW. Certainly the good
driving events would be coveted by owners of most sporty vehicles, and could
potentially run off many Porsche members. (I seem to remember something
about a Saturn infiltrating a Porsche event -- but maybe that was just a
tall tale....)

But I don't understand not letting potential Porsche owners from joining and
enjoying almost all the club benefits -- the magazine, newsletters, and
social events. How else do you find out how truly much fun a Porsche can be
without checking out the club that supports the marque?

Besides, having social events swamped by non-Porsche owners seems unlikely
to me. Given how many PCA members are experienced in giving 914 owners a
chilled reception, they should have no problem giving a truly cold shoulder
to the real Porsche wannabees.
