     Pfans,
     
     I just had my first dealer servicing of my Boxster, and it was a major 
     displeaser.  I just turned 2K miles, and despite the advice of the 
     manual and dealer to have the first oil change & service at 15K miles, 
     I decided that 30 minutes on a dynamometer is not adequate for shaving 
     off all of the initial metal filings, and the brake in oil should be 
     changed.  So I took my baby in for a $160 oil and (oil filter) change. 
     (Yes that's one hundred sixty US dollars for 9 quarts of oil, one oil 
     filter, a gasket, plus about an hour of labor).
     
     OK, I could have done it myself for about $35 - $40, next time I'll 
     know better; fair enough.  Now for the displeasers.
     
     I purchased an honest-to-god, genuine official Porsche factory bra 
     from the dealer, discounted at $114, only 40% more than a Colgan Bra 
     from Automotion, not too bad.  This bra requires the OWNER, to unscrew 
     two of the fender mounting screws under the front trunk lid, to 
     install two mounting clips.  Porsche provides the Torx wrench for 
     loosening the screw with the bra.  While using this factory tool to 
     attempt loosen the screw, I stripped the Torx socket on one side, (and 
     when the screw on the other side did not loosen readily, I decided to 
     bag the installation, and let the dealer handle it).  Apparently there 
     is a very bad combination of a SOFT sheet metal screw tightened down 
     HARD.  (BTW, I was told the mechanic had a hard time with the screw I 
     didn't strip).  The dealer had to drill out the stripped screw, and 
     replaced it (temporarily) with an ordinary slotted sheet metal screw.
     
     Now since I paid a premium for genuine Porsche aftermarket 
     accessories, and used on genuine Porsche provided tools for the 
     express purpose for which they were intended, why should I be saddled 
     with an extra $60 for the dealer to correct a problem caused by 
     either, a poor quality Porsche supplied tool, screws that were 
     installed to tight at the factory, or frozen in place by the paint, or 
     that were too soft to begin with, or a poorly designed after-market 
     Porsche product.  It's not like I sullied my Porsche with something 
     other than a genuine Porsche after market accessory (which in 
     retrospect I wish I had done.
     
     Now for a minor displeaser that was the result of good intentions.  
     This weekend I detailed my baby, washed and waxed the body and wheels, 
     cleaned the windows to streakless perfection, and even used the 
     special Meguars product for cleaning, polishing and protecting the 
     rear plastic windshield to clear perfection.  Well apparently the 
     dealer believes in cleaning the car whether it's needed or not.  I 
     found my front windshield streaked (not too badly) and the rear 
     windshield streaked (very badly, I just hope they didn't damage it).
     
     So what's the net-net?  If you want to pay a fair price for Porsche 
     service, do it yourself, or find a good reliable independent Pwrench.  
     Third party after-market products may be more trouble free than 
     Porsche provided products.  If you bring in a clean vehicle that you 
     wish to have returned in the same pristine condition, perhaps you had 
     best be explicit in telling the service department NOT to "clean" it.
     
     On the positive side: everyone I dealt with was very pleasant and 
     courteous, they offered me a loaner (even though I had not requested 
     one in advance, and they provided me with a ride to the nearest bus 
     stop in one of their own cars).
     
     Despite this experience, the Boxster still pleases.
     
     BTW, the dealer is Paul+Miller Porsche-Audi-Rolls-Landrover in 
     Parsippany N.J.
