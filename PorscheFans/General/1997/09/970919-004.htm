Japan has some government regulations which car makers have agreed to
follow) that limit the horsepower to something like 200 Kw.  So the
'Godzilla' GTR put out more like 300 Kw, but was 200 Kw on paper to keep
the government from 'outlawing' the car.  Second, Germany and some other
neighbouring countries enforce speed limiters at around 250Km/h.  So cars
like the 750 with a V12 that would push the car well over 300Km/h just stop
at 250.  Fast enough -- and a bizarre experience to feel a car pulling hard
accerlation at those speeds and suddenly feel like you've hit a massive
headwind gust.

BMW fits the limiter to all vehicles for all countries -- does Porsche?
