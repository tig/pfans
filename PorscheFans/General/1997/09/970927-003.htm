Hi folks,

I've been a Porsche fan since I was about 10 - and am seriously thinking of
springing for a new Boxter next summer for European Delivery.  I can't
think of a nicer way to spend a vacation than touring Europe in late
August/early September in a new Boxter.

I'm wondering if anyone has any tips out there on the European Delivery
aspect of it - any hits or suggestions on how to go about it?  I've
recently heard that they've added a 2% surcharge for European Delivery - is
this true, or just a dealer's attempt at a profit increase?

Also, any news on the new RS version of the Boxter?  Any chance of getting
one by late next August?

Lastly, does anyone have any hints on a general strategy for ordering
boxters -  should you call around in the entire state of California looking
for a dealer that has the smallest backlog, or is there some magical
allocation scheme based on the number of cars the dealership sold the
previous year, etc.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Brian.
