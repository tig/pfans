The figure Porsche gives for 400HP is the flywheel rating, not what you
actally put down on the ground.  The average loss from flywheel to the
pavement is what--about 15%?  If it dyno'ed at 400 rear-wheel horses, then
that means the TwinTurbo's HP figure would be rated at roughly 475.  That
seems pretty high, compared to Porsche's conservative rating of 400.

If it dyno'd at 430, then the printed rating would be about 495 on the
crankshaft?  I really doubt the engine has THAT much power.  

BUT, as we all know, you NEVER say NEVER when dealing with any 911...


WHICH brings up the top speed subject.  The factory claims 181, but I guess
thats for the 400 Flywheel HP.  If the TT's power was really more like 480
(which is reflected by those the dyno tests), then the top speed would be
over 190mph.  And isn't it funny how everyone keeps topping out at 192-195?
But every American Car lover's excuse (e.g. Motor Trend)? The speedometer
reads in error of up to 15mph!!  Yeah right.  I've seen at least 10 TT's at
over 190, and even have a home movie of one doing 190+.  Only you can
decide.......
