Car was put on PorscheFans website on 9/9/97.  SORRY; listed price was typo -
my apologies.  (You should have seen my email!  But really; $14000 for an
almost new 930!  If you really believed that, then I know "this bridge for
sale in New York..."  Some people actually offered me "less $," but only if
the car is "perfect.")
A new (detailed) description of the car follows.  

1985 Porsche 930
14500 miles (yes 14 thousand)
Estimated (by shop) at 420 HP
C2 turbo  and  C2 intercooler (oversize) set up "962 style"
Carbon fiber clutch disc and modified pressure plate
Custom designed stainless steel muffler and wastegate pipe
Turbo boost dialed in at 1.1 bar
Only run with 104 + octane racing gas (cleans engine)
5 speed transmission
Body redone end 1996 as C2 Turbo with original Porsche parts including
quarter panels (yes; fenders are slightly different), bumpers and lights
C2 windshield and lightweight RS side glass
New original rubber seals everywhere
New glasurit paint - 1992 special order Raspberry Red Metallic.  (See picture
under "classifieds" on www.porsche-911.com)
Interior redone with light grey leather C2 seats/panels and with new original
light grey carpet with special raspberry red Porsche crests and matching
black/raspberry red Momo wheel
CD player with all the good stuff
17 inch Borbet wheels (or Momo 3 piece) with 40/245 front and 35/275 rear
rubber.
Sell for best offer - looking for about $35,000. (need about that much to
finish my 962 race/street car)
Serious inquiries (not $ 14000 ones) to SNIJDERS@aol.com
Thanks (Emile Snijders - St. Petersburg, FL - 813.577.9520)
