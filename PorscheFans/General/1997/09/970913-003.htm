Porsche Colleagues,

  When something really good or something really bad happens you feel like
sharing it with others.

  I want to tell this group of my exceptionally GOOD EXPERIENCE with "BY
DESIGN AUTOMOTIVE" in Santa Monica, Calif.  My ordering involved both
"Jamie" and "Michael" at that company.

  I have been searching for a REASONABLY PRICED yet brand new 13 volume set
of the 911 & 911 turbo manuals from 1965 to 1989.

  After calling around to various vendors listed in Pano, etc., I became
quite discouraged at the financial outlay required to obtain these volumes.
I then happened upon an ad in Pano for "By Design," whose prices were so
reasonable that I was even a bit concerned about their legitimacy.  I
decided to take a chance and place a first order with them.  The order
consisted of the complete set of manuals, a Parts Price List, a case of
Porsche oil filters, and a Mahle fuel filter.  All but the '84 -'89 volumes
were shipped immediately.  The '84 -'89 volumes were back-ordered and I
have received them today.  Though their price had gone up, they honored
their originally quoted price to me (try to get that deal with Automotion
some time!) and they even picked up Fed-x charges for any waiting-time
inconvenience to me!  All this without my asking!!  Man, now that's the
kind of company I want to know and tell my friends about.

  If you're in the market for Workshop Manuals (or parts), I'd suggest you
give those folks a try.

Regards,

Mike Di Girolamo
'87 930 Dark Blue

BTW,  comments are strictly my own, I have no stock, relatives or financial
dealings with this company, and I stand to gain or lose nothing through
this posting.
