Bob:

The mechanical temperature gauges use Bourdon tubes; your engine oil 
doesn't flow through the capillary tube to the gauge.

Here's how it works:

    The capillary tube is sealed at both ends and filled with helium
    or nitrogen or something.  At the engine end, the tube is
    terminated in a bulb; at the gauge side, it feeds into one end of
    the Bourdon tube, which is just a thin, flexible, curved metal
    tube.  The other end of the Bourdon tube is sealed and attached
    to the gauge needle.

    Hot oil flows over the bulb and the temperature increases the
    pressure in the capillary tube... It's like a thermometer, except
    that the expanding medium is an inert gas instead of mercury.

    As the pressure increases, the curved Bourdon tube tends to
    straighten.  Since its sealed end is attached to the needle, the
    needle moves as the Bourdon tube unrolls.

    When the oil temperature drops, the pressure does, too... And
    the Bourdon tube rolls back up and pulls the needle down.

Now that you know how this Rube Goldberg contraption works, you can 
decide for yourself whether it's really "the way to go over 
electrical".
