Todd, there were several pieces of really sharp racing apparel being sold
last year by "MotorCars International."  One of them sounds like the jacket
you were describing. It was in their 1996 Special Issue. Their Customer
Service # is 1-800-977-9707. Hope that helps. If not, e-mail me directly and
I'll put you in touch with some of the memorabilia collectors I know. They
have some great racing jackets. By the way, **shameless plug** any of you
Porsche Fans out there who collect any Porsche stuff should be aware that
there is a newsletter (support group) for our form of sickness. I'm the
editor and the poster child. It's called Der Sammler. Contact me for more
info. **end of plug**                             Take care,     Tim Comeau
