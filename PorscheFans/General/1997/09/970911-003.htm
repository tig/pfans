Here's the Edmunds website review of the BMW 8 series. Not too good.


What do you get when you purchase a BMW 8-Series coupe? A car that costs 
way too much. Of course, BMW enthusiasts will argue that we are missing 
the boat, but we really have no idea who is supposed to buy this 
vehicle. 

The distinguishing feature of the BMW 8- Series is a noticeable lack of 
intent, a definite aberration in the standard order of BMW vehicle 
design. Initially developed as a luxury sports coupe, the 8-Series is 
now wallowing in a schizophrenic never-never land. Is the car sporty? 
Well its looks are appealing, but BMW's own M3 positively dusts the 
8-Series in the performance category. Is the 8-Series luxurious? Though 
filled with interesting and well- appointed accouterments such as an 
on-board computer, Nappa leather upholstery, 6-disc CD changer, 440-watt 
stereo and a heated driver's door lock, we think that it has a very 
cramped interior and don't feel that it is nicer than its competitors 
from Mercedes, Lincoln, and Lexus.

Unfortunately, BMW pulled the impressive CSi from the 8- Series lineup 
in 1996, removing the performance component that may have justified the 
exorbitant price asked for these cars. We feel that if you want a small, 
German sports car that costs between $70,000 and $90,000, you should 
look at a Porsche Carrera. If you simply want an exclusive luxury car 
that has a performance component check out the Lexus SC coupes; you'll 
be able to buy two for the price of one 8-Series.
