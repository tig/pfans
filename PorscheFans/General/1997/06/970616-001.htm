I recently just became a Porsche owner, I have always wanted to own a
Porsche but never had the oppertunities until recently.

I purchased a 1996 Carrea 2 coupe, with 5000 miles on it, I choose 1996
model year because the extra horse power and the new lifters which will
reduce the cost of ownership.

Since this is my first Porsche I have several questions see if anyone
can help me answer.

(1). Should the enginee under tray be removed for better cooling?  I
live in Atlanta, Georgia, things get pretty hot around here in the
summer here.  I have read somewhere that there was excess exhaust valve
wear from the heat built up in the under tray area.

(2). Will a 5 minite warm up in the moring bad for the engine?  I read
in the owner's manual that when you start your car in the morning just
go ahead and drive it right away, but keep the RPM under 4000, so is
there a problem to let the engine run for several minutes to warm it up
before start driving it?

(3). What weight of oil should I use?  I notice that all of the 1996
engines comes with Mobile 1 oil, what weight of oil do they use in the
factory? and What weight of oil should I use in the Atlanta, Georgia
area? 

(4). Is occasional white smoke from the tailpipe right after the engine
starts normal?  I have noticed several times that when I started the
engine there was a lot of white smoke that came out of the tail pipe,
and it stopped right away.  Am I under driving the enginee?  Or it is
normal for white smoke to come out of the tail pipe, the white smoke is
not like water vapors but seems like unburn fuel.  I gernerally drive
the car very soft, changing gears at around 3500 RPM, is this the cause
of the problem?

(5). I have notice the there is the ventilation opening on the engine
lid, and when it rains the water just goes right in the engine, would
the water damage the eigne?  In Georgia the weather is very
uinpredictable, sometime it could be 100 degrees and the next thing you
know it pours, if the engine is hot and it started raining, will the
rain water do damage to the hot running engine?

I would apprecited if someone can help me out on these questions, as you
can see I am a first time Porsche owner, I am trying to read and study
as much information as possible about the legend.

Thanks you
