    Only if you DROVE the car in that rainstorm, Bill... Generally,
    people who obsessively protect their cars from rock chips also
    avoid driving them in the rain.

    Yes... But if you don't want to damage your paint, it IS
    necessary to remove the bra when it gets wet.

    Left them off... Unless I'm driving across the country or
    something.

    Leaving a bra on all the time -- even if it never gets wet --
    can cause problems... The bra will scratch your paint if it flaps
    or moves around even a little, and if the car's parked in the sun
    with a bra but no cover, it'll develop "tan-lines".  

    Leave it off unless you're taking a long drive... Or buy one of
    those semi-permanent adhesive-backed clear urethane bras that
    Those Guys Graphics (800 350-4897) sells.
