Despite virtually the same sort of dire predictions that plagued
Riverside before it closed, I couldn't believe it when I found there
would be PCA events at Bridgehampton this year. After killing my
previous 944 at the same track in the spring of last year, I had said my
goodbyes to my favorite track thinking it would be closed at the end of
last year. I thought I would take my time to get a new car knowing it
would be this year at least before my finanaces would allow it.

When Barrry Lenoble told me the news that there would be events at The
Bridge, the search was on. After a month of looking around for a 944
Turbo S, I decided to purchase an '89 from my friend Corky Cartwright,
who is a professor at Rice University. A mututal friend of
ours, Wynne Dawson, was charged with getting the car to NY in time for
the Drivers Ed event last weekend. After being waylaid in Harrisburg, PA
with a faulty speed sensor, the car finally arrived last Tuesday Night.
On Wednesday morning it was delivered to Mark Tashjian to get the car
ready for the track. I picked it up on Thursday afternoon and drove it
back to Manhattan, thereby logging the second trip in the car with an
accrued 15 miles of experience with the car.

Early Friday morning Wynne and I left for Bridgehampton at the end of
Long Island, perhaps 100 miles from The City. By 8 O'Clock we had
reached the track complete with camping gear. I hadn't camped out since
I was a Boy Scout nearly 30 years ago. Be prepared we weren't!

The first session was a bit daunting to say the least. I had driven the
car a total of 115 miles and I was on the track after a year's layoff.
The car has been chipped and the turbo has been modified in some
still-mysterious way - still a K26 though. According to Corky, I could
expect around 300 HP - a little over twice that of my old 944. So I
decided to take it easy and learn the car.  Well, those two things
turned out to be mututally exclusive. The car required all my
concentration to drive because of the huge difference in
characteristics. Not only is this car much faster than my old steed, it
handles a lot more neutrally. The new BFG R1s didn't hurt matters
either. Leave it to me in the very first session to discover that I was
running out of 4th gear by pit out. That was limiting my top speed to
around 135. In the old car I was still accelerating at the bridge and
topping out 4th gear just before turn 3, which would be around 115 mph.
I was over 20 mph faster using 300 yards less track while carrying a
whole lot more kinetic energy down the hill. Wow!

On lap 3 a car went off in Echo Valley in a big way - there was a waving
yellow flag the first time I went by, and a premature checkered flag the
next time. The track chairman, Henry Hoeh, came up to me after the
session and asked if I was paying attention to the flaggers. I responded
that I thought I was. While I was hanging onto the bucking bronco, they
had been trying to black flag me to tell me I had left pit out with my
sunroof hatch
open. I just kept circulating around for 2 laps missing 4 black flags
from 2 separate flagging stations! I told him to yell at
me because I certainly deserved it. Much to his credit he didn't.

The second session went a bit more smoothly. I was still having trouble
with the much higher speeds on the front straight, the back straight,
and the east straight, but the Millstone straight was no problem after I
discovered my car doesn't share the same braking point as a race-prepped
914-6! The superb brakes (the same ones used on the 928S4 and the 993s)
still managed to haul me down to a
get-it-around-the-corner-without-crashing mode. Whew!

Before the third session, I went out for a ride with Barry Lenoble. At
last year's spring event, he had just been promoted from white run group
to black. Now he is an instructor! I found him actually chatty while he
was turning times in the 1:55 range with my excessive bulk taking up the
passenger seat. He has a very interesting way of taking the downhill
that involves heavy braking at the bridge and then accelerating through
turn 2 to turn 3. His line is extremely consistent from lap to lap.

During the third session, Barry went for a ride with me. Between the
ride with him and his in-car instruction, I got down to a very stable
1:57 by the end of the session. I was still having to pussyfoot at the
end of the front and back straights because of the incredibly scary
speeds, but by using 5th from pit out to the bridge I was getting up to
little over 140 mph.

I practiced my new methods and tried Barry's interesting approach to the
downhill in the fourth session while reminding myself that it was the
end of the day when very bad things have a way of happening and the deer
become more frequent.

Friday night brought the Constant Drizzles followed by the an hour or so
of the Great Rains. If there is anything you absolutely do not want to
happen to you on your first camping trip in 30 years is rain combined
with unseasonably low tempeartures in the 50s. Between the two I managed
to get perhaps 3 hours sleep.

Saturday morning was more of the same. The sky would get lighter for a
few moments only to rain even heavier. When it was my turn to get out on
the track there was a constant drizzle. I reminded myself of my human
fallibilities and pressed onwards. Most people hate driving in the wet,
but I love it. It is truly the great equalizer since raw horsepower will
only lead you to spinning your tires. Everything was great until I got
behind this 911 cabrio that wasn't coming within 3 feet of the apexes.
He finally managed to see in his rear view mirror 3 feet from his rear
bumper where I had been camped for over a lap. A few moments later the
brake sensor warning light came on. I had managed to go through a half a
stock brake pad on the left front in about an hour of track time!
Fortunately, I had a front set of Cool Carbons that Cork had included
with the car.

Everybody warned me to take it easy with the new pads since they could
be unpredictable until they bed in. I took my usual spot at the front of
the cars to leave pit out for the next session. (It is something I
picked up from reading about Ayrton Senna. He always made it a point of
being the first one out in practice sessions. If it works for him...
;-)) The car immediately behind me was one of the new C4S wide-body
911s. It has nearly the same horsepower without all the turbo-lag stuff
*and* it has the new suspension instroduced with the 993. So when he was
right on my tail after the warmup lap, I gave him the passing signal in
Millstone straight. Instead of backing off and following the advice of
my betters, I got the Red Mist and chased after him. This guy can drive!
His name is Ben Ohebshalom. I don't know where he got his experience,
but he is certainly consistent and quick. He pulled me a bit down the
straights and he picked up 1 or 2 car lengths consistently in the
lightbulb. But I hung on and  closed on him in the downhill and through
echo valley. We ran nose-to-tail for the entire session.

After the session I got a stern talking to from my mechanic and the
acting chief-instructor, Mark Tashjian (filling in for Nick Ventura). He
reminded me of the fate that typically befalls people who make progress
at the track too quickly.

The last two sessions passed with no major consequence. I don't know
what my times were on Saturday, but they must have been faster than
Friday. Once I get the car really set up, adjust to the different
braking points and shifting points, and get over my fear of falling off
the edge of the world at speeds faster than 120, I think this car is
capable of times in the low 1:50s. However, I'm probably going to put
the stock chips back in to increase reliability. But it was a blast to
have 300 HP at the disposal of my overly-heavy right foot.

I decided not to run on Sunday since it would entail another night of
little or no sleep in a wet tent. At least traffic was light until we
hit The City. I slept for over 12 hours while visions of Porsches danced
in my head...
