Steve:

Funny that this question came up right now... I've been talking about 
car books with another list-member in private e-mail.  Here's my 
recommended-reading list:

    Prepare to Win.
    Tune To Win.
    Engineer To Win.
    Carroll Smith's Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners & Plumbing Handbook [aka 
    Screw To Win].

All of the above are by Carroll Smith; the newest in the series is
over ten years old (and the oldest is nearly 25 years old), but
they're still the best.  If you're at all serious about racing, you 
MUST have all these books.

        A Twist of the Wrist.
        A Twist of the Wrist II.
        The Soft Science of Road Racing Motorcycles.

These three were written by Keith Code.  They're all allegedly about
racing motorcycles, but the lessons Keith teaches are applicable to
racing cars, as well.

Hell... The lessons are applicable to everyday LIFE; if you've ever
wanted to become good at ANYTHING, you should read "Twist of the
Wrist".  It absolutely changed my life when I first read 
it... I can't recommend it enough.

        The Technique of Motor Racing, by Piero Taruffi.
        Winning: A Race Driver's Handbook, by George Anderson et al.
        Secrets of Solo Racing, by Henry Watts.
        Bob Bondurant on High-Performance Driving.
        Sports Car and Competition Driving, by Paul Frere.
        Drive To Win, by Carroll Smith.

These books are about driving.  I happen to own all of them, but I
don't think I'd recommend going out and buying each one... Each has
a VERY different perspective; while there's unique information in
each book, I think you can safely buy just the ones that focus on
your particular interests.  To help you choose, here are some mini
reviews:

"The Technique of Motor Racing" -- A classic, written in the '50s by
one of the great racing drivers.  Taruffi was one of the first
drivers to analyze the behavior of a race car mathematically; while
a lot of the book is SERIOUSLY out of date, some of the information
is still valid and his first-person accounts of racing during the
Golden Age are pretty cool.  If the historical aspects interest you
or you want to impress your friends with your faultless taste in
racing books, buy this one; if you're looking for hard information
that's still valid TODAY, don't.

"Winning: A Race Driver's Handbook" -- An excellent, nuts-and-bolts
tutorial on SCCA racing.  The book packs a LOT of information into a
very readable package... It's written by an engineer who really
knows how to write -- a rarity -- and is supplemented by extensive
comments from Carroll Smith, Bertil Roos, Paul Van Valkenburgh,
Danny Collins, Dennis Eade, Tony Kester, and Charlie and Norma
Williams.  I'd recommend buying this one unless you're only 
planning on doing autocrosses.

"Secrets of Solo Racing" -- If you didn't buy "Winning: A Race
Driver's Handbook", you must buy this one... It's a VERY good
handbook on autocrossing and time trialing.  Great for beginners and
advanced drivers alike, it covers driving skills (everything from how
to hold the steering wheel to how to learn the racing line), deals
briefly with car preparation, AND explains exactly what happens at
solo driving events (from what you need to bring, through a
description of scoring and flags, to instructions for corner-working
and instructing).  The amount of information that Hank managed to
pack into this book is pretty staggering... And if he left something
out, you can always just ask him to eleborate; he's here on the PFans 
list.

"Bob Bondurant on High-Performance Driving" -- Some people love this
book; some hate it... I'm ambivalent.  On the one hand, Bondurant
really doesn't provide all that much technical information in the
book; most of it is devoted to overly (in my opinion) self-indulgent
reminisces about the good old days when he was a hot-shot racer.  On
the other hand, however, two pieces of information that ARE in the
book probably saved my life... See my dilemna?  The book's cheap, so
you can probably afford to buy it and see whether it does anything
for you; maybe you'll get more out of it than I did. [By the way,
the two bits of information were: "If the car's going off the road
into the dirt, straighten the wheel" and "If you've spun, are now
heading backward at 70 miles per hour, and want to turn the car back
around, turn the wheel TOWARD the object (wall, curb, or other car)
that you want to avoid hitting."]

"Sports Car and Competition Driving" -- Paul Frere wrte this book
much as Taruffi wrote his; it contains clear, easy-to-follow
mathematical analyses of car behavior, backed up by the experience
and knowledge of a master driver.  Like Bondurant's book, there's a
fair amount of reminiscing, but Frere manages to keep that part of
the book under control and it really doesn't ever get annoying.  My
only real complaint about this book is that there are a fair number
of errors in the math... But Frere's intent is usually clear enough
that they're easy to spot.

"Drive To Win" -- Sigh... I don't know WHAT to say about this book.
It's not really a "driving" book; it's actually about how to succeed
in top-echelon motor racing.  I'd guess that the book's only REALLY
useful to about a hundred people in the country... The others have
either ALREADY made it into the upper strata of racing or have no
chance in hell of ever doing so.  Carroll says as much in the book;
he CONSTANTLY reminds us that it's ENORMOUSLY hard to become a
successful pro racer.  On the other hand, the book IS written by the
God of racing authors, and there IS a fair amount of technical
discussion that builds upon and/or corrects information in his
earlier books (the ten-page section on shock absorbers, for instance,
is the best I've read ANYWHERE), so it's probably worthwhile.  I
don't know... If you already have his other four books, you might as
well get this one too, if for no other reason than to say you did.

    Porsche 911 Performance Handbook, by Bruce Anderson.
    Weber Carburettors, by John Passini.
    Weber Carburetors, by Pat Braden.
    Weber Carburettors Workshop Manual, published by Haynes.
    Porsche Factory Workshop Manuals.
    Porsche 914 (4-cyl) Repair Manual, published by Haynes.        
    Porsche 914-4/914-6 Handbook, published by Lash Int'l.

Anderson's book is a MUST-HAVE if you're running a 914/6.  Like Henry 
Watts, Bruce is on the Porschefans list.

If you have Weber carbs, you probably need all three of the Weber
books I've listed; they all overlap to some extent, but each
contains unique and necessary information.

The Factory workshop manuals are much nicer than the third-party
books, but they're also expensive (hundreds of dollars) so if you'd
rather not spend that much, you can get by with the Haynes and Lash
books (and help from friends here on the list).

    Inside Racing Technology, by Paul Haney & Jeff Braun.    
    Race Car Vehicle Dynamics, by Milliken and Milliken.

If you have any interest at all in what goes into the design of 
racing cars, these books are a good place to learn.

"Inside Racing Technology" is written for laymen and never delves
into any math... It's good if you know nothing at all about race
cars and just want a broad, chatty overview of the subject.  The book 
includes transcripts of interviews with real live race-car designers; 
it's an easy, enjoyable read.

"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics", on the other hand, is VERY technical;
it's a 900-page book that contains more-or-less the sum total of
everything that's known about tire and suspension behavior.  It's a
VERY tough book to read; the index is huge (34 pages long) but poorly
organized, so it's often difficult to quickly find information. 
Nevertheless, all the information IS in there somewhere; this really
is the most comprehensive book available on the subject.

Ok...

In addition to the books I listed, I believe that CATALOGS from 
the following campanies are necessary to have:

     Aircraft Spruce and Specialty (800 824-1930)
     AJ-USA (619 452-8900)
     Earl's (310 609-1602)
     MSC Tools (800 645-7270)
     Pegasus Racing (800 688-6946)
     Racer Wholesale (800 886-RACE)
     Small Parts, Inc. (800 220-4242)
     Tilton Engineering (805 688-2353)

WIth the exception of the Aircraft Spruce and Tilton catalogs, which 
cost $5 and $25 respectively (with corresponding rebates on orders), 
all these catalogs are FREE... Even the enormous (3300+ pages) MSC 
catalog!  Get them.

Oh... And you should probably get all the Porsche-specific catalogs 
from Tweeks, Automotion, Stoddard's, Auto Atlanta, etc., as 
well.

-Andy

P.S.  On the offchance that this messagemight have relevance to
      other PFans members who aren't on the "914" sub-list, I'm
      crossposting it to the "911" and "General" lists... Hope no
      one minds.
