I can help you with the first four questions, and if you get an answer for 
the fifth question through private email please let me know what the answer 
is, because I share your concern:  my first Porsche is a 1997 Carrera 2, 
 which is identical to yours.

By the way, from model year 1995-on the 911's are also called by their 
factory model number:  993 (which is the "cool" way of referring to them!) 
 You should also consider posting to the 911@porschefans.com group (see my 
address line) since those subscribers are dedicated, hard core (and very 
knowledgeable) 911 owners.

Now for the help (note I didn't use the word "answer" as these are not the 
definitive last words on 911s, just my own learning from the past few 
months of ownership; other P-fans please join in!)

1.  The engine undertray heat problem came from the previous generation of 
911s (the '89 to '94 models, aka the 964's)  The 993 undertray is 
supposedly better at removing excess heat, but Bruce Anderson (world 
renowned Porsche guru and 911@porschefans subscriber) said in a recent 
issue of Excellence magazine (a great Porsche educational resource) that he 
still recommends removing the undertray on the 993, even though there 
hasn't been enough data collected on the 993 undertray issue as there is 
with the 964.  (I am waiting to hear more evidence before removing mine.)

2.  I *think* the reason for no stationary warm-up is that with the 
air-cooled engine it is better to get moving ASAP to get moving air to the 
rear and help the fan cool the engine.  Anybody with a better theory out 
there?

3.  I asked the Porsche dealer about weight of Mobil 1, and he recommended 
using the "appropriate temperature range" oil, which here in sunny CA is 
the higher weight 15W-50.

4.  The puff of smoke is from oil in the cylinders.  Same dealer said that 
since the engine is a "flat" six that overnight oil seeps into the 
horizontal cylinders, and so you'll get the puff of oil smoke in the 
morning.  This is part of the reason why the owner's manual also said that 
the engine is designed to consume oil, and you have to add oil 
occasionally.  For comparison, my two Japanese sports cars never needed 
extra oil in the eight years I had 'em, yet my 3000-mile 993 needs an extra 
quart every 1000 - 1500 miles, sort of like the '76 Impala I once had with 
200,000 miles on it!

Some of the resources I use to educate myself on the marque include two 
magazines dedicated to Porsches:  Excellence and 911 & Porsche World, the 
occasional European Car magazine, joining the PCA, and of course this email 
group.

Have fun with your new 993, mine has been worth every cent!

Subject: 	Questions on a 1996 Porsche C2

I recently just became a Porsche owner, I have always wanted to own a
Porsche but never had the oppertunities until recently.

I purchased a 1996 Carrea 2 coupe, with 5000 miles on it, I choose 1996
model year because the extra horse power and the new lifters which will
reduce the cost of ownership.

Since this is my first Porsche I have several questions see if anyone
can help me answer.

(1). Should the enginee under tray be removed for better cooling?  I
live in Atlanta, Georgia, things get pretty hot around here in the
summer here.  I have read somewhere that there was excess exhaust valve
wear from the heat built up in the under tray area.

(2). Will a 5 minite warm up in the moring bad for the engine?  I read
in the owner's manual that when you start your car in the morning just
go ahead and drive it right away, but keep the RPM under 4000, so is
there a problem to let the engine run for several minutes to warm it up
before start driving it?

(3). What weight of oil should I use?  I notice that all of the 1996
engines comes with Mobile 1 oil, what weight of oil do they use in the
factory? and What weight of oil should I use in the Atlanta, Georgia
area?

(4). Is occasional white smoke from the tailpipe right after the engine
starts normal?  I have noticed several times that when I started the
engine there was a lot of white smoke that came out of the tail pipe,
and it stopped right away.  Am I under driving the enginee?  Or it is
normal for white smoke to come out of the tail pipe, the white smoke is
not like water vapors but seems like unburn fuel.  I gernerally drive
the car very soft, changing gears at around 3500 RPM, is this the cause
of the problem?

(5). I have notice the there is the ventilation opening on the engine
lid, and when it rains the water just goes right in the engine, would
the water damage the eigne?  In Georgia the weather is very
uinpredictable, sometime it could be 100 degrees and the next thing you
know it pours, if the engine is hot and it started raining, will the
rain water do damage to the hot running engine?

I would apprecited if someone can help me out on these questions, as you
can see I am a first time Porsche owner, I am trying to read and study
as much information as possible about the legend.

Thanks you

Please e-mail me back at robin@premiopc.com
