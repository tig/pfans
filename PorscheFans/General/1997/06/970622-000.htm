Re bras:

Yes, despite the hassles, it is in your best interest to remove it and
let it dry...the paint  could have a tendency to weather differently.  I
have been removing it on my 914 and another brand x sedan, and have had
no probs with the paint after doing it.  That is not to say it hasn't
been left on through rain and sun, though, like on long x-countries where
removal is impractical.  As with most things, a little common sense like
checking the paint underneath, and tightness of the install weekly makes
all the difference.

Have fun with your new Boxter!  Fly Navy!  Jim C.
