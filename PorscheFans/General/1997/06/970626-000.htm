Here is another thread that should spark a bushfire in PorscheFans.com.

As I understand it the importance of wheel design and the benefit of the
three piece design is the symmetry of the forging or casting process.  I
don't purport any expertise here, but I'd very much like to hear more on
the topic.  From my perspective, the lightest and strongest wheel is the
best.  Appearance cannot be discarded.  A three piece wheel may be
structurally sound and more durable and more easily repaired.
For all things striving for automotive perfection I look to
'pre-ball-breaking-rule-change' F1.  If an F1 car runs a given seat, seat
belt, brake pad material etc. then that is simply the best.  F1 wheels are
one piece.

Here's a thing.  I once had an extraordinary experience with unsprung
weight.  In a particularly light car (not exactly a Caterham or Lotus) but
light with manual steering, no air and strictly two seats.  Driving an MX5
(aka Miata) with factory wheels and tyres (according to Mazda both the
wheels and the tyres were specially built for minimum weight -- we all
understand the fundamental importance of reduced unsprung weight) and then
immediately after switching to after-market wheels and tyres.  The tyres
were weighed at the shop (a pounds or two kilos or so heavier each so no
big deal.)  But the glorious 17" wheels (unlike the factory 14" wheels)
where a surprising 8 kilos overweight (I don't know, something like 4
pounds heavier each.)  We were interested in unsprung weight because it's a
light car and Mazda raved about the advantages of their wheel and tyre
combination.  Incredibly, we drove the car out of the shop and we were
immediately impressed by the smooth running, sure footed control of the
car.  To a point.  As soon as road speed reached upwards of 80 clicks (80
km/h or roughly 50 mph) the car exhibited the handling characteristics of a
car with no traction -- front or rear.  In other words, it felt like it
couldn't keep the rubber on the road.  So.  Were the dampers (shocks) or
springs worn out?  No.  This car was a 92 model, practically new with very
few miles on the clock.  Were the tyres 'running on the nipples'?  In other
words, were the tyres so new that the manufacturing process leaves
'nipples' of rubber on the tread face.  No, we diligently scrubbed the
tyres in the first few miles to get a good tread pattern on the ground.
Braking and cornering were on rails like shit sticks to a blanket.  We went
back to the wheel shop and they arranged to check the suspension (that was
their defence -- "your shocks are dead, mate") but the car prooved to be
handling just fine up to about 50 km/h (30 mph) but it became "dangerous on
rolling road" and they didn't finish the test at higher speeds.

In short, we concluded that if the unsprung weight (really just the wheel
and tyre, because the suspension arms and the percentage of the spring and
shock moving with the road) changes too much, expect to change (and some
how recalibrate) your springs and shocks.  Ironically, if you're only
running on the track, you may not realise this dramatic effect.  So, with a
set of lowered, stiffer, non-linear springs, the car ended up handling fine
to the limit.  But we still question if it's really handling any better
than it did with the light, responsive (and wimpy, thin) wheels and rubber
from the ractory.  We could hardly make real tests of cornering G forces
etc.  Well,  if you're on the track, wind up the rubber, get wider rims,
but be cautious about upsprung weight.

Now let's hear some more about wheel manufacture.  I'm in the market for
some rims for a 94 RS A that I want on the track.
