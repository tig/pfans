Perry,
  I just finished watching 4 hrs. of taped highlights (mostly the last 3
hrs. of the race) my friend taped off his dish from speedvision.  The race
was very exciting, a lot of car problems and fires as you noted.  The in-car
camera of the Nissan's was most interesting, as they were often tailing a
GT1 car.  Another highlight was a Viper on fire, after a crash that took off
the rear end of the car, the driver decides to start it up anyways, and the
car explodes into flames with the driver barely getting out... quite
exciting coverage.
