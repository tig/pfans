hi Mark,

> what the heck are 3-piece wheels?  i see people talking about them all 

There are three different ways that a wheel can be built.

The simplest, and probably the most common, is a one piece wheel.  In
this case, the entire wheel is one assembly. The hub, and rim are made
at the same time. This wheel is either cast or forged. The problem 
with this approach is that a specific wheel must be built for
every size, and every offset.

The next type of wheel is a two piece wheel. The center section, or
hub, is made in one piece, the rim section in another, and then the two
pieces are assembled.  The reason manufacturers make two piece wheels
is for flexibility. The same 16" hub can be used for an 6", 7", 8",
etc.  wide wheel. The hub can be forged (stronger) and the rim cast
(cheaper), and so on.

The third type of wheel is the three piece. This has the center
section as one piece, and each rim 1/2 is a separate piece. To
make a complete wheel, you take two rim pieces, and assemble
them on a hub. Voila, one wheel.

Again, the reason manufacturers make three piece wheels is for even
more flexibility. The same hub can be used, as with a two piece wheel,
but the rim halfs can be customized to create wheels with different
widths and different offsets.  For example, I the 86 944 turbo uses one
offset (23mm?), the 87 944 turbo another offset (55mm?). The
manufactuer of a three peice wheel could make 1 hub, and 2 different
rim halfs to create wheels for both cars.

The absolute best wheels are forged 1 piece wheels. Compared to a cast
wheel, a forged wheel will either be stronger, or lighter, or both.
Compared to a multipiece wheel, a forged 1 piece will be lighter and
stronger (no fasteners to add weight or to break, etc.). 

Hope this helped,
