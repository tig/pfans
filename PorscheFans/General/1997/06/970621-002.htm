Hey, Bill...

>	Does this mean that one remover the bra after
a rainstorm?? That would seem like a monumental hassle.

Errr, you don't leave a bra on in the rain, or in a car wash, or any other
situation where it might get wet.  There is a small spot on my car where a
previous owner bra left on one time that caused moisture to seep under the
paint and turn the clear coat white.  You can also get color transfer from
the black vinyl or the felt edging, and also lots of grit and sand and
stones will get rubbed into your paint in a most disturbing fashion.  Kinda
like polishing stones on your paint job.

>	What have other P-fans done with their bras??
Left them on ??

No--only the one time I mentioned above.  

>	BTW since my 'Buzz Boxster' is now wearing a bra,
does that make him a transvestite??<G>

Cars belonging to guys are generally "she's" (just as mine is a "he"), but
yours might be an exception.  Are you trying to tell us something?
