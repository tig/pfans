This has *got* to be a popular question ad nauseum but I cannot find it
answered anywhere, so here goes.  My 911, which I purchased last year, needs
new tires relatively soon and I am interested in recommendations.  Parameters
are:

	- '87 911 with 16" wheels: 205/55-16 front, 225/50-16 rear
	- limited, non-competitive track driving but mostly "spirited" :-)
		around-town and backroad hills driving, so the better
		traction and handling the better, but not to any extreme
	- excellent wet traction/handling is a must
	- good ride quality and noise is a high want
	- longest tread life as possible given remaining constraints

Most of my tire ideas so far come from The Tire Rack's web site
(www.tirerack.com), which places these three in their top performance category:
Michelin MXX3 Pilot, Bridgestone Potenza S-02, Yokohama Nexus (PZero is also in
that category but is not available in the 225/50 size).  Of these, the S-02's
seem the best for my needs but are the most expensive.  All have treadwear
ratings around 140-160; what does that translate to in real mileage?  The next
category down includes others like Firestone SZ50 with significantly lower
handling ratings and price, and higher tread life (220).

To shed some light on where I am now, the car currently has Michelin XGT-Z's
and I think that the traction isn't all that great (seems that way; I have no
good comparison points), and the ride is fairly harsh, and they're fairly
expensive.  Just seems it could be better...

People at the last driver's ed event I was at were pretty split with no
consistent strong preferences except one guy driving a highly modified VW GTI
who insisted the Michelin Pilots were absolutely the best for what I was
looking for.  The guy with the fastest seeming laps in an essentially identical
('89) 911 to mine had BFG Comp T/A Z's, which are quite a bit less expensive
than the above Tire Rack top choices.  Of course it could have been the driver
(naaah...).

Thanks -- I'll duck if flames are thrown....
