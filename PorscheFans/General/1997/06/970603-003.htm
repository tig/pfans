I, too, tried out this on my wife's '77 924 this past weekend (got a
nasty sunburn to show for it, too). I wasn't able to get any of the 3M
products, but I used the same techniques with Meguiar's Deep Crystal
Polish (prepped w/ Paint Cleaner where necessary) and Mother's
California Gold pure paste Carnauba Wax. Wash, dry, polish, and wax _by
hand_.

The results are fantastic, especially considering that it's still the
same coat of paint from 20 years ago! It really gleams now! My summary
comments would be the following:

1) I really like putting on the wax by hand; I love the feel it gives me
for what I'm doing, along with excellent control. One downside is that,
with the paste wax, it takes a little longer to get the same amount of
wax on the car. However, aside from the excellent shine, it also means
you use a lot less wax, since there's no applicator to absorb it all up.

2) There's still some spots I'd like to go over with the polish another
time or two, to get them just as shiny.

3) Next time I'll wear a t-shirt!
