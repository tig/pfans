Jay,                                                                
                                                                    
Thanks very much for posting your waxing experience.  I followed it  
and I can't believe it's the same paint job.  I posted this article 
today to my compats in the 928 section, and I'll cc General too.
Well done!


                                                                    
The PO did not have a garage, and up here in the pacific 
northwest, that can mean bad news to a black '85 928 S.  
                                                                        
My wife, first skeptical, is now a Porsche fan                          
and has done a fantastic job of re-conditioning the leather             
interior, also black.  ALL of the techniques used were from             
suggestions from this porschefans list.  Excellent stuff people!        
                                                                        
Has anyone else done the glaze and wax treatment? 
(General section, May 13, 1997)  I did, and
the results are so spectacular!!!  It took a while to find 3M Imperial
Hand Glaze, but this stuff was well worth it for me. Carnuba alone
would not have the same effect at all; glaze is the key.  Couldn't find
the recommended carnuba, but Mother's seems to work quite well.
As the instructions indicate, take your time; I spent about 7 hours.
Results: rich, very deep black. Stunning.
Last month, I waxed our '93 Jimmy SLT with a liquid, and there
is no comparison; which means this weekend is booked.  Me, glaze,
hands in the carnuba, getting up close and personal with the wife's
truck.  But the rewards are worth it. ;)  If your finish has lost any
lustre or depth, try this glaze and wax treatment that is described in
the General section of this list, May 13, 1997.  Well, if you do it
any other way, you're wasting your time.  Do your significant other's
vehicle as well. disclaimer:Your rewards might not be the same as mine.
