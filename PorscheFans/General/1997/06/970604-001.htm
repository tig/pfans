I wonder if that damn commercial with the Saturns and Porsches has anything
to do with both achieving favorable results?

Subj:    J.D. Power and Associates Reports: Sales Satisfaction Improves for
Dealers  Acro
Date:    97-06-04 12:09:01 EDT
From:    AOL News

    AGOURA HILLS, Calif., June 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Saturn, followed by
Mercedes-
Benz and Porsche achieved top honors in the latest J.D. Power and Associates
Sales Satisfaction Study (SSI)(SM).  Their strong performances are the result
of high ratings in three areas: Better salesperson communication, the
convenience of the transaction process, and the confidence of better quality
vehicles.  These three issues contributed to the across-the-board sales
satisfaction improvements for the industry in the J.D. Power and Associates
1997 Sales Satisfaction Study(SM).
          "Customers are looking for guidance from their salesperson rather
than a
time consuming deal," commented Loretta Seymour, director of automotive sales
research at J.D. Power and Associates.  "To continue to increase sales
satisfaction, the industry must continue to focus on customer communication
and its role in making the entire purchase process easier," Ms. Seymour
added.
          Communication
    The importance of the salesperson's knowledge during the transaction is
perhaps more important than ever before as a result of ongoing improvements
in
the information available to consumers.  The five areas where salespeople
should be knowledgeable are in areas involving: competitive models, warranty
coverage, service requirements, financing options and the model's features.
By providing an opportunity for a smoother purchase process, the
salesperson's
job is also easier and gives the salesperson more opportunity to spend
quality
time with the customer.  For example, Saturn's no-haggle pricing makes the
transaction process easier for the salesperson, freeing him or her up to
better accommodate the customer's information needs and concentrate on
explaining the benefits of Saturn.
          Convenience
    The nameplates at the top (Saturn, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche) that have
shown the greatest improvement in sales satisfaction also understand that
time
is money, and are excelling in convenience-related issues.  These issues
include: the speed and handling of the transaction process as well as a
negotiation process that is more relaxed.  Satisfaction essentially declines
as more time is spent at the dealership on the transaction process.
Nameplates that can get customers in and out of dealerships quickly will
enjoy
higher levels of sales satisfaction.
          The study also points out that the sales process is viewed better
by
consumers during a leasing transaction rather than a purchase.  This can
partially be explained by the fact that salespeople and consumers have become
more comfortable with the no-haggle nature of a leasing transaction.
          Confidence
    The study also reveals that the quality of vehicles today can instill
much-needed confidence in the product for the buyer.  Quality improvements
(as
indicated in J.D. Power and Associates recently published Initial Quality
Study(SM)) that have occurred in the industry naturally help improve the
buyer's view of the salesperson and the dealer selling their vehicle.
          The study concludes that poor customer handling increases the risk
of auto
dealers ultimately losing the customer to the increasing number of
alternative
buying services available, such as the internet or superstores.
          The J.D. Power and Associates Sales Satisfaction Study(SM) is
designed to
provide manufacturers with important customer information on vehicle buyer
satisfaction, both with their vehicles as well as the sales and delivery
process.  Three measures that make up the Sales Satisfaction Index are:
salesperson performance (45%), delivery activities (25%) and initial product
condition (30%).
