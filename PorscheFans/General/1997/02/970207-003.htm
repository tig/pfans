    CHICAGO, Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Porsche's new entry level model, the
Boxster, is the winner of the 1997 MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Award for Best
Sports Car.
          The Award was presented Thursday at a press conference in
conjunction with
the 1997 Chicago Auto Show.  It acknowledges the industry's outstanding
automotive products and designs for the model year.
          The staff of "MotorWeek," television's nationally syndicated
automotive
program, selects the winners after evaluating more than 150 vehicles per
year.
Recipients are chosen in each of 16 individual classes based on a compilation
of criteria such as product integrity, performance, pricing, value and
purpose.  Only one vehicle is picked as the benchmark for each class.
          "MotorWeek's" Prize is the second North American award earned by
the
Porsche Boxster.  The editors of Popular Science magazine earlier presented
the model with its "Best of What's New" medallion for 1996.
          Introduced at North American Porsche dealerships in January of
1997, the
Boxster is the first completely new Porsche sports car in 19 years.  It
derives its name from its horizontally-opposed, six-cylinder 'boxer' engine
and its roadster or speedster body style.  Priced beginning at $39,980, the
two-seat mid-engine car is also the least expensive open-cockpit model
Porsche
has offered for sale in America in a decade.
