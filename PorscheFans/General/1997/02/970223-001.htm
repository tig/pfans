	Perry, let me tell you about my experience with the Porsche world.
	I am a reletive newcomer to the Porsche family having bought my
	87 944 from one of the other 944 list members. I didn't buy it
	directly from him, though, I bought it from the dealership where
	he traded it in on a 968. This was mid-May of 1995. The dealership
	I bought it from was Park Place Porsche in Dallas. This is an
	authorized Porsche dealership, of course. At this time, I knew
	as much about Porsche as most of us do astrophysics. I did a dumb
	thing; I bought the first Porsche I looked at without anyone
	checking it out (I presume the dealer did). I got lucky; the PO
	was wonderful to the car and it showed. Things could've been much
	worse for me. Like I said, I got lucky. But...there were some
	things that happened during the time of the sale that, had they
	happened to me now, I would've walked out the door cackling	
	without buying a thing:

	1. The salescreature kept referring to the car as a "Porsh".
	
	2. He did not inform me that I was able to buy a warranty
	from PCNA. This little "error" on his part would've saved
	me about $1400 later in the year.

	3. This one is ticky tacky but...I paid 12K for an 87 944.
	This is an immaculate car with only 63K but...that's way,
	way too high. I was uninformed and I paid the price which
	I deserved, but I'll be dammed if I ever buy anything from that
	dealer again. You see, right out the door, they've lost a
	customer. If they would have been informed, knowledgable
	about their product (at least enough to pronounce the
	name correctly), and not trying to make a slaughter on a guy's
	first Porsche, I  might've been a repeat customer. I'm 32 and my
	SO is well off. There's a lot more Porsches in my future that
	could've come from them but not anymore. But wait it gets
	better (told you this was long)...

	I received a flier in the mail from this same dealership last
	June announcing their free, special Customer Service Day where
	they looked over your car for problems (for free) and also
	gave you a certificate for a free oil change later on. I called
	down and made an appointment to come in. A few relevant, personal
	details on me...I am a stickler for details on this car. I don't
	tolerate funny sounds or smells, inconsistent performance and
	handling, etc. The car is maintained by a top-notch independent
	Porsche shop in Dallas that feels the same way about my car as I
	do. I didn't expect the dealership to find any problems with my
	car but guess what?? They found $700 worth of problems. What
	follows are the "problems" and their real world solution:

	1. Diagnosis of bad front wheel bearings by the dealership
	Cost: $350

	Reality Check: My shop and I raised the car off the ground
	and wiggled the wheels. About 2mm of play in each one side
	to side. We did a wheel bearing *adjustment* on them. Total
	cost: $29.95

	2. Diagnosis of bad/leaky transaxle seals (some Swepco
	on the transaxle case)
	Cost: $350

	Reality Check: My shop and I raised the car again and checked
	the tranny fluid. It was full. Drove it another week and checked
	again, still full. I've been driving it since last June and not
	*once* have I needed to add *any* fluid. My shop says that after
	a number of years, the 944 transaxle seals will seep just a tiny
	bit (enough to get on the transaxle case) but won't really leak
	anough to need replacement. Still, we check it every time I'm in
	there. 
	Total Cost: $0

	This explains why the PCA regional clubs bring in their
	own, independent shops to do tech seminars. Because the
	jokers employed by the dealerships don't know what the
	hell they're doing. The independent shops are around because
	a substantial number of Porsche owners don't trust the dealerships
	as far as they can throw them. If the dealerships were places
	of quality and trust, there would be no (or little) independent
	shops.

	This dealership, either through incompetence or direct malice,
	tried to screw me out of $700. In addition to the gobs of cash
	they made off me from the sale! Either way, I don't want my car
	serviced there nor do I want to buy another from them. Maybe
	things would be different if Champion Porsche were just down the
	road instead of these yabos but I don't know. This latest 
	episode with Town North is just another notch in a long stick
	of notches for me as far as dealerships go. So. That's my take
	on the matter (boy, are my fingers tired!)
