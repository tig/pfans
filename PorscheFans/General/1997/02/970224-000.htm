Jay:

Sorry to hear about your bad experience and initial orientation to "Porsche
Buying and Service".

As a Porsche owner for over 35 years and one who grew up and spent many years
in the automobile business, let me suggest to you the following:

1. The greatest protection you have in purchase is to spend the time
beforehand to become "a knowledgable" buyer.  I think from your description,
due to buyer impulse, emotion, etc., you were not. (not a criticism, very
common).  While the purchase price seems somewhat high, the price was not (at
least 18 months ago) totally out of line for "superclean perfect" vehicles in
our area of the country (Western Illinois).

2. While most "enduring" (long in business) dealerships have at least a few
(1 or more) long term "professional" sales people who know the product and
customer, most of the automobile sales people (or *associates*,
*consultants*, etc as some are know today) are "floaters".  They go from one
dealership to the other particularly early in their "career", if they stay in
the business.  So you're somewhat lucky if your *creature* knew the physical
difference between a Porsche, a Porch, and a Peuguot, let alone the
mechancial details.   Manufacturers (and dealers) spend lots of money on
training materials, seminars, etc. for salespeople.  Sadly, some the the
"backs of the books" are never even broken open!

3. There are as many (or more) bad or disreputable "independent" Porsche
repair facilities (i.e. "Dieters Independent Plumbing and Porsche Repair") as
there are unsavory Porsche dealers.  The key is to find someone, through
experience or recommendations of others, that you can trust.  The Porsche
dealer in Dallas that offered you the "Free Inspection and Oil Change" with
recommendations on hundreds of dollars worth of service and maintenance that
was not required, gave you a product or service worth *exactly*what you paid
for it....nothing!   Certainly not unique to the automobile business.

4. However, the overall practices and your experience as a dissatisfied
customer should not be taken lightly.  Send a letter to the dealer principal
(owner).  I would also highly recommend that your both call the Porsche Cars
North America Customer Commitment Group (800-545-8039) and followup with a
letter to Fred Schwab, the President of PCNA in Reno, detailing your
experiences.  The manufacturer and their representative wants, and you
deserve, better treatment than you received from the dealer in Dallas. 

5. As always, the Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware) applies, particularly to the
often emotional purchases we make in buying and maintaining Porsches.
