Dudes:

A friend of mine needs to get rid of his magazine collection.  He 
has:

    Road & Track, September 1955 to present
    Sports Cars Illustrated, Sept 1955 thru March 1961 (end)
    Car & Driver,  April 1961 to present
    Sports Car Graphic, August 1959 thru June 1971 (end)
    Motor Trend, July 1971 to present
    Automobile, all issues to present

    Oh yeah, Porsche Panorama, March 1972 to present

The magazines are stored in a couple of dozen banker's boxes in a
vault in downtown San Francisco.  Buyer will have to come and pick 
them up or arrange for a moving or shipping company to do it.

He will not sell individual issues, but he will sell each masthead 
individually.

If you're interested, make him an offer.  His name is Harry 
Somerfield and his e-mail address is:

    somerfield@aol.com

Please do NOT respond to me or to the list.
