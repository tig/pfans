	I know I wasn't at the time. Thanks to PorscheFans, though,
	that'll never happen again :)

	I knew this at the time I bought the car. I was hoping
	Porsche was different, though. Apparently not.

	Now this is absolutely true! Some of the scariest places
	on earth are those Bob's Four-N Car repair places. But I already
	knew not to go there. Because it was an authorized Porsche service
	facility, I had my guard down. Frankly, in my opinion, one should
	not have to have one's guard up when visiting the dealership
	for service. That's just not right. I didn't exactly pay nothing
	for it, either. I wasted two hours of my time there as well. They
	already owe me for that.

	You're gonna kill me but I'm too lazy and I have too much to
	do to go to all that trouble. I've already "spoken" by letting
	my fingers (and pocketbook) do the walking and by informing
	anyone who'll listen on Porschefans about my experiences with
	dealerships.

	Right on, man...
