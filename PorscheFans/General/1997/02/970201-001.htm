Subject: Porsche SuperBowl Commercials

I was going to post this earlier, but forgot.

Was anyone else disappointed in the Porsche commercials
aired during the Super Bowl.  Porsche was cited as one
of the main sponsors of the Super Bowl, but I thought
the commercials that were aired were rather weak and
unimpressive.  Just no fun.  Very little footage of
high speed or technical driving on street, track or
otherwise.  Or did I just miss them?

Keep Porsching,

=========       
Wayne, I personally enjoyed the Boxster ad and got pumped about the car,
having been somewhat luke warm about it to date (I'm not convinced they
won't immediately increase the price in light of large back orders - they
did it before in the late 80's and almost killed the company)  I especially
liked the evocation of the spirit of the 550 in the ad.  However, with that
said, I do miss the ad with the engineer hitting the cash machine so that he
can get some more marks to "test" the twin turbo on the Nurburgring.  Bruce
