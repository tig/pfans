I read your reference to Lipshy and it caught my attention.  I new you were
in Dallas from some of your posts, but it hadn't occured to me to ask for
some help until I saw your latest post.  

Problem (sort of):

My most recent car was purchased in Dallas, and through some phone calls I
eliminated all of the local dealerships as having been the service location
of the car.  The car was purchased new in '89 by an MD in Ft. Worth, but I
couldn't find service records at the Ft. Worth, or Dallas dealerships, even
the one he traded it in at.  In any case when I flew down to drive the car
back home I noticed that there were plate frames front and rear from Lipshy.
Bingo-- I don't remember how long its been since they closed, but if you
know of any way to get access to thier old service files I would appreciate
knowing.  I was going to contact PCNA to see if they had any ideas, but
haven't gotten around to it yet.  

Any info at all would help, and thanks in advance.
