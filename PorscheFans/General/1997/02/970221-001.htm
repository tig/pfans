I am trying to get ahold of a friend I have in Jacksonville.  His name is
Keith Newcombe.  He drives a dark blue C2.  He was at the 48 Hours of
Sebring this past weekend, but I did not have a chance to see him before
he left on Saturday.  I don't have his phone number anymore.  If anyone in
the Crown region can tell me how to get in touch with Keith I would
appreciate it.  I will be in Savannah instructing at the Florida Citrus
Drivers Ed, so maybe I will see him there.

John

I tried this again, and realized that I was only partly correct.  WinZIP
will work only if the file is MIME-encoded.  Unfortunately, the PorscheFans
digests are NOT.  When I did this, I was looking at a digest (same NTMail
list server software) that has a file attached.  THEIR mail client hadn't
encoded the mime so that MY mail client would recognize it, but WinZIP did.

I received a suggestion a few weeks ago from James J Dempsey (a P-Fan) that
the digests be formatted in RFC 1153 format. I've sent this suggestion on to
the folks at Internet Shopper (that's who makes NTMail).  He uses the MH
mail reader, but I don't anything about this.

In short, we're still looking for a mail client that separates messages. 
Probably won't happen unless Internet Shopper changes the format of the
digests.

Sorry about the mis-information with WinZIP.  I should've double-checked. 
So much for being infallable (ha!).
