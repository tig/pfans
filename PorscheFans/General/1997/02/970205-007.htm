Chris: Today's brakes are all that you'll need to slow a car down. Use of
the clutch does help you slow down, but it will cost you more in the long
run. Engines are much tighter than in the "old days". They are designed to
go, not the slow. Brakes are easier and cheaper to replace than clutches and
piston rings. Save the clutch for shifting.

Also, use "heel & toe" for the down-shifts (and the up-shifts too if your
sycro's are going bad). If you don't know what that is, sign up for a PCA
Driver's Education event near you.

Please don't think I'm trying to be facetious. Too many people say they know
how to drive a stick, and yet they don't "heel & toe" while downshifting.
The technique of "heel & toe" will extend the life of your clutch, and also
reduce the wear on your rings. Your car will be happier and so will your
wallet.

Also, once you master the technique you'll impress all you friends.

Good luck and happy motoring.

Ed
