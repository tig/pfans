John,
I was curious as to the outcome of the now notorious "Lipshitz Fiasco", s=
o
I sent an e-mail to Lipshy  (@lipshy.com ) and asked them what had happen=
ed.
Initially, I was pleased to hear that they had "helped Eric get into a ne=
w=20
Porsche" and that they "think Eric is pleased with the outcome."

That sounded pretty good to me so I decided to e-mail Eric to get his sid=
e of
the=20
story.   His response was, let=92s just say, quite a different story.  He=
 also
seemed=20
pretty pissed off that Lipshy was telling people that they had helped him
out.

He said that Lipshy has done almost nothing for him and that they still s=
eem
to be=20
avoiding him and "draggin their feet".  Based on what he said, the only m=
oney

he has seen from them is a few hundred $$ for a temporary rental car.   H=
e
said
that the money used for a replacement car came from his own insurance and=
 his
own wallet.  He said he had to find it on his own too.

Eric and Lipshy are still  "negotiating" and he said he will let me and t=
he
rest=20
of the porschefans list know the outcome.

I myself am not from the Texas area so I have never heard about Lipshy ot=
her
than=20
what I have read about on this list.    Quite a fiasco indeed!
