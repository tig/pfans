<< Today was the Maverick Region new members party held at Town North
 Porsche in Dallas. I dropped by for a bit and was looking around the
 showroom at the rather pitiful collection of 993's they had when the
 salescreature nearest me picked up the phone when it rang. It was
 obviously a friend of his on the other end because of his relaxed
 attitude. Apparently, this friend asked him what was going on at the
 dealership because his response was "...oh, we've got this Porsche club
 new member's party today...it doesn't really do anything for us, but hey.
 maybe we'll sell something to somebody..." Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll never
 buy anything from Town North, that's for sure. Dealerships and associated
 salescritters give me the *creeps*!

Jay:

PCA sends out a "management ideas" newsletter called "Region Focus" (as I
recall) to it's regional officers.

A few years ago, they had a article on relations of PCA Clubs (applicable to
Car Clubs in general) with local dealers.  This article characterized many of
the Porsche dealers as believing that Club members were just a bunch of
"freeloaders" who never bought (or buy) parts or service at the local
dealership and just want to "hang around, waste people's time" and "demand
freebies" (posters, T-shirts, dealership "gifts" for events, etc.).  It
characterized the worst of the regions members as those who asked the dealer
to make his facility available for a showing or tech session (using the
service bays and dealers car) and then having "Dieter and Helga", from
"Dieter's Independent Plumbing and Porsche Repair Shop" giving all the
"helpful hints" to members and garnering potential new service customers.  In
essence, the dealer got "zip" out of his encounter with PCA and it's members.

The article gave suggestions for improved relations, some of which were just
"common sense" joint courtesies and recognition of the realities of relations
with firms who are in fact a profit oriented (vs enthusiast "gabbing")
business.

The bottom line is that there are some "sullied faces" on both sides of the
coin....
(BTW, not trying to minimize the "Lipshitz" (sp) dealer fiasco)
