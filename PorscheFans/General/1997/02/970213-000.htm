Hi,

I'm a new owner of an 89 Cabriolet who needs advice 
concerning tires. The car has squirly handling because of 
mismatched tires. While they're the proper sizes, 
the mismatch is Aquatreads on the front and Goodyear 
GT&4s on the back. 

I'm looking for good handling, but since this will be a 
daily commuter car when the weather gets nice, ride and
wet traction are important as well (with even the possibility
of being trapped in a bit of late spring snow). No 
autocrossing is planned.

My options:

1. Put on 4 Goodrich Comp T/A ZRs recommended by
a local Porsche mechanic

2. Install Firestone SZ50s. The Tire Rack web page 
gave them high marks, even better than the Comp T/As.

3. Buy just 2 GT&4s for the front.  This would be the least expensive 
solution, but I'd like to hear about your opinion of the GT&4 as a street tire
on a 911. . .good choice, mediocre, or don't do it.

4. Some other brand.

Would like to learn about the experiences of others, 
and apologize if this topic's been covered on the 
chatline in the past.

Email to: "email4me@hotmail.com"

Thanks, Bill
