I was catching up on some recent digests that I had gotten behind on when I
ran across the message from Eric Heneke in Austin (just up the road from San
Antonio) about the 911 that was totaled while being towed.   One word...LAME.

I too have had some bad experiences with towing my 911.  Twice I have had my
car damaged during a tow.   I agree that a flat bed is the only way to tow a
Porsche or any performance vehicle for that matter.  Unfortunately I was
forced to use the other type of tow truck both of these times and it was the
same thing...scrubbing the car on the road.  It's just too low.  

Of course, at least I still have my car!   I can't imaging what I would feel
like
if my car were actually totaled while being towed!   My condolences to the
former 911 owner and hopefully everything works out for him.

Being from San Antonio, I have had pretty good luck with the dealerships I
have taken my cars to (usually Porsche Volvo Center).   I have a friend with
a Porsche in Austin who tells me that Lipschy is notorious for being
difficult
to work with.  That's got to be frustrating too since they are the only
Porsche dealership in Austin.   My friend usually comes to San Antonio on my
recommendations.

Eric, if you read this message, let us know how things work out!!
