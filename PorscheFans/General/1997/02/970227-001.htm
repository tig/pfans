Now this is fine listmeistering in action.

It occurs to me that aside from the very annoying spammming
feature we seem to have gotten past, we have had an amazingly
efficient list which works well technically and is meisted
with  more or less an even hand.  Certainly an entertaining one :)

I don't remember when pfans started up exactly, but this is a thanks
to the co-listmeisters who have brought us into the post-Porschephiles
era with flair.  (can't wait for that search feature :)

Bummer that Stan crashed and burned.  He started a good thing
but could not keep up with it.   Great example of being your own worst
enemy I suppose.  Hope he is back on track wherever he is.

In the meantime, Go Porschefans.
