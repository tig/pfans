Just got the following from one of the mail servers along the way from
my domain to Porschefans.com...

What it means is that, although I only sent the message once (honest!!!)
it was unable to get it through to one of the users at Porschefans.com,
so is continuing to retry, despite its having made it to every other
user at Porschefans.com (multiple times...)

The lesson that this teaches me is that I will not address a message to
more than one user at Porschefans.com, unless I am willing to see it,
again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and
again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and
again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and
again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and
again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
and again, and again, possibly incurring the 
wrath, or at least the disdain of my many PorscheFan friends...

I will not make the same mistake twice...
