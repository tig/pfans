I'm looking for ways to keep my new Boxster new.  I want to get a car
cover -- one that will be good for keeping the car outside in the rain
sometimes.

People generally talk about Evolution-4 fabric, but I don't see anyone
that actually sells it.  When I look at catalogs like Automotion,
Tweeks and MotorCars Intl. they have their own designations for their
all-weather fabric.  What do people recommend for outdoor covers?  Do
you have any suggestions on how to use them and how not to use them?
Can you destroy your car's finish if you use a cover improperly?

I'm also thinking about one of these temporary garage structures.
They generally have aluminum frames and some sort of vinyl covering
with zippered doors.  I have a price list from Cover-It whose name I
got from Excellence, I think.  Does anyone have any recommendations
for this type of structure?  Other brands to consider?  Do they really
work well for keeping cars out of the weather?  What floor covering
should I use?  I was thinking of using crushed stone on top of a
moisture barrier.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
