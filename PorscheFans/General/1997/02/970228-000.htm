      FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - German luxury car maker Porsche AG
reported Friday higher profit and sales figures for the first half
of the 1997 fiscal year than it had given last month.
      The latest figures showed earnings of 38.4 million marks ($20.7
million) for the six-month period.
      The figure amounts to more than triple the earnings of 10.3
million ($6.13 million) in the first half of the 1996 fiscal year,
which ended July 31.
      Porsche said sales were 1.8 billion marks ($1.07 billion), a 26
percent improvement over the same period last year.
      Porsche said that better operational processes, and also the
stronger U.S. dollar, had boosted the performance of the company,
whose common voting shares are all held by members of the founding
Porsche and Piech families.
      In its January preliminary first-half report, Porsche had given
a profit figure of 36 million marks ($21.4 million) and reported
sales of 1.7 billion marks ($1.01 billion).
