IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN A GREAT DEAL ON FACTORY RIMS AND STICKY TIRES FOR
YOUR 944, 944T OR 968, PLEASE READ ON.

FOR SALE:
(2) 7.5 X 17 C2 TURBO STYLE RIMS, PROFESSIONALLY POLISHED, PERFECT 
(2) 9.0 X 17 C2 TURBO STYLE RIMS, PROFESSIONALLY POLISHED, PERFECT
(2) 235/45/17 TOYO PROXIS F1-SR DOT RACING TIRES, FULL TREAD, NEW
(2) 255/40/17 TOYO PROXIS F1-SR DOT RACING TIRES, FULL TREAD, NEW

RIMS ARE FACTORY 968, I HAVE THEM ON MY 1987 944T. THEY FILL OUT THE
FENDER WELLS NICELY AND DONT RUB, EVEN WITH  LOWERED SUSPENSION AND BIG
BRAKES.

THE TIRES WERE DEVELOPED BY TOYO FOR THE CARRERA CUP SERIES. IN MY OPINION
THEY ARE THE BEST DOT RACE TIRE ON THE MARKET. THEY ARE ALSO GREAT ON THE
STREET AND IN THE RAIN.

ALL TIRES ARE MOUNTED AND BALANCED ON THE RIMS AND HAVE BEEN HEAT CYCLED ONCE
( OFF TRACK). I FIND THAT IF YOU HEAT CYCLE THE TIRES BEFORE RACING ON THEM
THEY LAST LONGER. I BUY AND RUN THE
TIRES FULL TREAD AND THEY STILL STICK LIKE GLUE. I HAVE A LIMITED 
RACING BUDGET AND SHAVING THE TIRES CUTS THE USEFUL LIFE BY 50%.  

I KNOW THEY ARE SELLING THE C2 TURBO REPLICAS REAL CHEAP THESE DAYS, BUT YOU
ARE GETTING WHAT YOU PAY FOR. BESIDES, AT 165MPH  ON THE FRONT STRAIGHT AT
MOROSO, OR THE BACK STRAIGHT AT ROAD
ATLANTA, OR THE AIRPORT STRAIGHT AT SEBRING, IT'S NICE TO KNOW THE
FACTORY RIMS ARE UNDER YOU  AND THE TIRES WERE DEVELOPED FOR PORSCHE RACING.

I AM ASKING 2500 FOR THE SET, BUT WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER BECAUSE I AM
CURRENTLY BUILDING A NEW ENGINE AND REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

I ALSO HAVE LOTS OF OTHER 944/944T/968 PARTS FOR SALE SUCH AS;
944 TURBO RACE CHIPS FOR THE AUTOTHORITY MASS FLOW SENSOR, 23.5MM 944 TURBO
TORSION BARS, 26.5MM 944 TURBO AXLES WITH CV BOOTS, 944 TURBO REAR CONTROL
ARMS, 944 TURBO BEIGH LEATHER ELECTRIC FRONT SEATS, A SET OF (4) 968 3.0
LITRE  PISTONS AND RODS AND A 968 (BAFFLED) OIL PAN.

PLEASE EMAIL TO: ( MOROSO100@AOL.COM )
