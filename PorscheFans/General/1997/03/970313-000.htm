	I don't think so. I have some idea of what the bills would be.
	While it's true that general reliability among Porsches is
	good, there can be, and are, catastrophic failures that you
	should be aware of. In addition to these, there are very
	expensive 30K sevice intervals (try a $1000 each). Now price
	a clutch job or transmission job on a 993. Hell, price an
	*oil*change* on a 993. Regularly scheduled maintenance plus
	the potential cost of a real problem make this car a disaster
	for someone who's not in a position to bite a really big
	bullet...

	I hate this attitude, too, Wade (and I was the one who said it)
	but let's face facts; a 96 993 is gonna cost you upwards of 50K.
	You have two ways of buying this car; you can layout 50K in cash
	or you can finance the car with something like 10K down and
	monthly payments around $850. Monthly payments of $850 is more
	than what 70% of America pays for their housing cost much less
	*one* car. I am not an elitist. I am not a snob. I swear to god,
	I'm not. But facts are facts; if you can afford a new or almost
	new 993, then you're pretty damn well off compared to the rest
	of America. If you are that well off, it follows that you can
	probably afford the maintenance as well. I know that how much
	money each of us makes is probably a very sensitive subject on
	Porschefans, in general, because of the kind of cars we have and
	probably would make us pretty unpopular on an unmoderated forum.
	Lots of people see Porsche owners as nothing but wealthy snobs.
	I did at one time. The truth of the matter is, not all of us are
	(and especially not the ones on Porschefans) snobs, but (and this
	is a generalization so look out!) I think that Porsche owners as a
	whole have things a lot better than most people and are able
	to afford the recreation that these cars give us. I think
	(generalize) that this is probably even more true for those who
	can afford a new 993, a 962, or a 917. If you can actually buy
	any of those cars, then I think it logically follows you can
	probably afford the upkeep, too.

	Wow, what a digression! If I offended anyone, I didn't mean to.
	That's just how I see things in this world. And believe me, the
	last thing I would be caught dead at is being a snobby Porsche
	owner. Trust me. I'm copying this to general so follow-ups go
	there so Andy and Scott don't get mad at me :) Thanks for
	listening...
