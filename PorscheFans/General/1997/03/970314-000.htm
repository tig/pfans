	I wasn't aware of the 993 having a weak distributor problem...

	Hmm. I thought I'd said this above; regularly scheduled
	maintenance for the 993 is very expensive. Regularly 
	scheduled maintenance for all Porsches is expensive
	compared to "normal" cars. That was part of my orginal
	point; that you shouldn't buy a Porsche if you're scared of/
	unable to absorb expensive maintenance costs. This is
	especially true of the 993.

	Also, the potential of "owner failure" i.e. failure to
	operate the car properly. Burning the clutch (easy to do
	on a Porsche if you're not familar with them), clashing the
	transmission (see above), etc.

	Proper maintenance on the 993 is not theft or overcharging.
	The car is just very expensive to work on, it takes a great
	of training to do it right, and this leads to expensive repairs.
	But, we may just not see eye to eye on this point; I'm not sure
	how one could afford 50-70K for a car and not be in a position to
	also afford the maintenance on it. If there are any 993 owners
	in this position reading this, speak up!

	Not at all. If I were in your position reading my orginal post
	and not knowing me personally, I probably would thought the
	same thing you did. Let's face it; Porschefans is a nice, cozy,
	*moderated* environment where we all pretty much have the same
	excellent philosophy about these cars. Try posting your views on
	a unmoderated newsgroup and see how many people respond with
	"shut up you slimey rich Porsche owner". I like it in here, the
	weather is much nicer...
