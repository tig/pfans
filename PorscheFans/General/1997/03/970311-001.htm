Everyone,

I have an '84 944 with 160,000 on the clock(!!!!!!!!!!!!) and I now have a
couple of concerns:

1.  The power windows on my car work WITHOUT a key in the ignition, or the
switch being on.

2.  I am almost constantly losing coolant; I have the 160 degree thermostat and
thermoswitch on the radiator.  Maybe I am not bleeding the system correctly.

3.  The car has now developed a roar from the passenger side, rear.  Bearings,
possibly?  It occurs only under hard acceleration in first and second gear.

4.  The horn does not work with the wheel straight on, but turn the wheel a few
degrees either direction, and it works.  Ground/power issue?

HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Michael

p.s.  For those of you who wonder about high-mileage cars:  I bought my car 3
years ago, had no records, no clue about the maintenance, and a set of H rated
tires, good body, but poor paint job.  The only things that have happened to
this car are the clutch at 96,000, and a broken timing belt, associated parts,
and 4 valves, along with the head gasket at 144,000 miles.  The car has run
flawlessly since and between.  It now has a set of Dunlop D40M2s on it in
225/50-15, after having a set of Yokohama A509s.  The Yoko's lasted about 7
months.
