Hi all-
        I'd like to thank you all for the help with my previous post about
buying one of these cars.  Now, I've got another question: I'm about to look
at a car which was advertised as "minor front damage" - the damage was
supposed to be to the front spoiler.  The owner says the car looks fine, it
has been completely repaired.  That's all well and good but it's also
apparently got a "rebuilt" title...which means an insurance company deemed
it totaled at some point, thereby making the damage somewhat less than
minor, right?  Is there anything in particular with these cars that I should
check the damage on when I see it?  The owner has agreed without heistation
to let me take the car to a local Porsche dealer and let them look it over
for me, so I will make sure they check the frame and all.  Thanks in advance
for any help you can give on the subject.
