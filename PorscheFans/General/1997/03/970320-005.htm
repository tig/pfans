Dirk,

You can get GT1 in the 15 gallon drums.  I suspect that you would save
enough on the cost of oil to pay for the pump.  I'd consider just
getting one yourself, 15 gallons doesn't last that long... 5 oil changes
plus a little for topping off.  Scary to think about it that way, isnt'
it?

Bob Brewer
