Greetings from Los Angeles -=20

I have finally test-driven a Boxter today, after doing much
research and visiting many "hands off" pre-sold Boxters in
my search for the ideal color & options.=20

This is clearly a beautiful car, and a great value even at
sticker prices. I would like to point out that NO DEALERS in
the L.A. area were adding bogus "dealer packs" like $1,200
wax jobs at this point in time. I suspect that the wealthy
"gotta have it first" buyers have all picked up their
January - March cars, and the L.A. Dealers can no longer
gouge their customers with prices above factory sticker.

My previous Porsche was a then-new '84 944. Although both
the original 944 and the new Boxter have 2.5 liter engines,
the Boxter is more powerful, with a smoother and broader
power band. All in all, a much nicer car!=20

I also drove a 97 Carrera coupe, which has 282 hp, a 5.3 sec
0-60mph, and a curb weight of 3,064 lbs. In comparison, the
Boxter has 201 hp, a 6.7 sec 0-60 mph, and a curb weight of
2,755 lbs......=20

No surprise to 911 fans, but the Carrera puts out the
performance one expects from a Porsche. Although the lighter
Boxter had fabulous handling & balance, the damn 911 is
noticeably quicker, and this bugs me!=20

So, without comparing prices, apples or oranges, I just want
a Boxter that has more horsepower!

I've heard some RUMORS that the 1998 BOXTER will feature a
3.0 liter power plant, at about 240 hp. At the lighter curb
weight, this should compare much more favorably to the
heavier Carrera at 282 hp, although perhaps still not enough
juice.....=20

Then, of course there's the talk about turbos....=20

I need the REAL FACTS on the next power upgrade for the
BOXTER! What and when.....????=20

Since I'll already have to wait for several months, like
everyone else who orders a 1997 Boxter to their specs, I am
considering placing the order for the 1998 with the specific
power plant/aspiration option upgrade, and just wait for it.

I'd rather wait a year and get "the real deal", than buy the
last of the "wimpy engine Boxters" this year, and feel like
a sap with a four cylinder Z-3 NEXT YEAR....!!!=20

Any info will be greatly appreciated!

Many thanks in advance!=20

Don
