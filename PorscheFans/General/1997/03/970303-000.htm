I'm chipping in as we insure zillions (well... thousands, really) of
Porsches and this is an area we're concerned with.

As each state is individually regulated by its respective Dept/Bureau
of Insurance, *anyone* may or may not have such an exclusion in their
insurance policy.  Yes, it *is* valid, unless the company is
illegally including an unapproved form, which I doubt.  Also watch
out for a form entitled "Off Road Exclusion" or something similar. 
This may seem to only apply to RV's and four-wheelers at a glance. 
However, consider that if you're not on the road, you're off of it. 
When you're on the track, you're not on the road.  Zap... no coverage
on the track, at the gymkhana etc.

We don't cover track events etc. either, but we're up-front about it.
 More on that below.

You did the right thing in getting the underwriter's opinion
(although thats all it is) While this may offend some agents out
there, it is my advice not to trust an agent's word on technical
coverage issues like this.  I'll skip my justification for that
statement for the sake of brevity.

1.  READ your insurance policy (almost nobody does).
2.  Get responses to questions IN WRITING.  Preferably on insurance
company letterhead.  i.e. put the company on the hook, not the agent
who may or may not be properly covered for Errors & Omissions
(malpractice).
3.  If you don't like what you hear, talk to your state's Dept. of
Insurance and get their opinion, which is the one that really counts.
 Don't take it for granted an underwriter's opinion will hold up.  It
*may* not.

mph.  

Given the policy language you quoted, this is probably correct, and
you can expect no coverage of any kind.

It sure doesn't.  Thats a pretty bad attitude.  Here's why she said
it:  She's afraid in case of a catastrophe the company would get sued
anyway, and would have to defend, even though the contract expressly
stipulates no coverage and you'll lose.  Happens all the time.  She's
saving herself the potential bother by dumping you.  Nice.  With us,
you can drive the car on the track all you want... but its not
covered and you know it:  This exclusion (the exact policy language)
is right on the insurance app, and you must put your initials right
on it, indicating you're aware of and are OK w/the exclusion.  The
exact policy language is also found at
http://www.lelandwest.com/lpu.html and
http://www.lelandwest.com/concours.html).

State Farm CAN NOT legally cancel you during the policy period based
on driving the auto on the track.  They do have whats known as an
"underwriting window" in the first 10-90 days where they can cancel
for just about any reason.  Let me know what state you're in and I'll
tell you how long the window is.  Other than that, baloney... they
can't cancel, although they may do it anyway and see if you report
them to the state, then rescind and say "oops" if you do.  What they
*can* do is nonrenew your entire policy... in *many* but not all
states.  Again, I can tell for certain if I know what jurisdiction
the auto is driven in.

autocross,

If an off-road exclusion exists, Yes.  If not, Maybe and Probably
Not.  However, you might have to fight them over it, which may be
more trouble than its worth.

I strongly suggest you get that in writing from the insurance
company, and NOT the agent.  It may indeed be covered (make sure you
get them to expressly cite the policy provision extending you the
coverage).  I've seen instances where companies have gray area in
their policies and fight the claim.

Yikes!  Nothing personal, but thats why we can't cover this sort of
thing... the demand for track coverage (as a whole) is very low, and
the costs to us are huge.  We'd have to write literally hundreds of
insurance policies to cover just your losses.  Since we cover pretty
much only Porsche fanatics to start with, our frequency of losses
would be *way* over the norm.

We have one, and its approved and used in every state we do business
in (again, we go out of our way to ensure folks know what they're
buying in advance, and are OK w/this).  You apparently have a policy
that does not have such an exclusion.  Notice, however, that ***Mr.
Pultz is with the same insurance company you are***, and he has this
ironclad exclusion.

Why?  Could be a couple of reasons:
1.  He's in a different state than you are, and the exclusion is
filed in his state and not in yours.  The core policy is probably the
same, but the endorsements often vary significantly.
2.  Whether you're in different states or not, that exclusion may be
a new addition that you'll get saddled with the next time your policy


renews, or have now and just don't know it.  Have you read your
policy lately?  Have you saved *everything* you get from your
insurance company, and actually read it?  I don't say this to be
insulting.  Far from it.  Its just our experience that people don't
read insurance forms, and I want to take extra care to warn you that
something may have slipped past you.

To everyone else:  You *need* to read your policy and ask questions
to be sure you're also happy with what you have.
