      FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - BMW and Mercedes are already there,
Audi is thinking about it and now comes Porsche: The German maker
of luxury sports cars may build a plant in the United States.
      Porsche chairman Wendelin Wiedking, in a newspaper interview
published Sunday, said the company was looking not only at the
production costs, but also at the quality of the finishing and the
clients' attitude to the origin of the product.
      ``We see great chances in Europe, but also in the United States.
That's our biggest export market and the tendency of Americans to
buy products made in their country is very big,'' Wiedking told the
Welt am Sonntag.
      Porsche needs a new plant to accommodate growing production.
      Porsche's plant in Zuffenhausen, outside Stuttgart, was built to
make 20,000 cars annually; this year, Porsche plans to make 32,000
cars there.
      The company also has a plant in Finland, which is assembling the
new Boxster models.
      After plans to build a four-wheel drive, Jeep-like vehicle
jointly with Mercedes fell through, Porsche will develop its own
sport-utility vehicle, Wiedking told the newspaper.
      Audi, the luxury car unit of Volkswagen, said last week that it
is considering building a plant int he United States after the turn
of the century.
      Porsche and Audi would follow fellow German automakers BMW and
Mercedes-Benz, which recently built plants in South Carolina and
Alabama, respectively.
