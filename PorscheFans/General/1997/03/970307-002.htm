Not neccesarily!  Any time an insurance company takes title to a car they
will issue a rebuitl, reconditioned, frame damaged, totalled, or salvage
title.  This is true in most states if not all.  The brands on the title vary
from state to state and situation to situation, but they all mean the same
thing:  some insurance company has taken title to the vehicle at some point,
or the owner has purchased the car back at "salvage" price and fixed it
himself with the money from the initial settlement, or sold it to someone
else to fix.   

It could have been as minor as a complete paint job to make the car totalled.
If a vehicle is stolen and payed off, and then recovered after the payoff, it
is owned by the insurance company and they will apply for title with brands
and resell it.    You need to know how old it is, and what it was worth when
the damage occured.  It may be no big deal.  Body work is common, but really
good body work is not.  Have it looked at carefully and ADJUST the price
downward for the brand on the title regardless of how well the repairs look.
