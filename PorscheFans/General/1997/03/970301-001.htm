I don't know, but I also don't agree with the 3 second limit.
My understanding of the laser systems are that they are
'instant on' types and 'instant read' vi interferometry
  (well, 2*distance*freq/#periods-to-lock/speed-o-light)
  where the #periods-to-lock will still keep us in the
  sub-millisecond range.
So, information I've heard, and principles I know of, lead to
the conclusion that IF you've detected the laser energy, it's
too late 'cause you've been tagged.  The only exception is if
you've picked up some stray reflections from tagging a different
car.  .....IMHO

But, I've also heard that these systems require quite a bit more
training and technical capabilities than their radar counter parts.
Maybe that's where you're getting a break?

Keep Porsching,

PS. I responded to 'General@PorscheFans.com'  it's more appropriate
for this discussion.
