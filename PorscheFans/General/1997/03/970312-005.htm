Hi all;

I have a couple of general engine building questions
I need advice on.

1st.  If you use a gasket and it still leaks oil what
kind of sealer should be used along with the gasket.
Can I use Loctite Orange or is it just for gasketless
sealing?  Should I use some kind of gasket cement
to glue the gaskets in place before assembly or
should I avoid their use?

2nd.  How do you tell if a ball or roller type bearing is
bad?  If the center washer type things separate from the
bearing must the bearing be replaced even if it seems
OK when assembled?

3rd.  How do you tell if the wrist pin to piston fit is OK.
If there is any movement at all when the rod is twisted
is that too much?  If I have a machine shop replace the
bushings in the con rod where the pin goes through can
they get a tighter fit or will it end up just as loose as it is
now or maybe even looser if they don't do a great job?
Kind of the same question for valve guides as well?

4th.  when they say to measure the radial play and the
end play and the axial play just what do they really mean?
end float
end play
radial play
axial play
any others?

5th. What do you put in the strut tube besides the strut?  Like
oil, anti-freeze/water, or ATF, or nothing?

Sorry for so many questions at once.
