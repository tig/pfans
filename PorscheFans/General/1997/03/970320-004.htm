Long about my second or third oil change, I picked up a couple of those 
mythical four quart jugs of Kendal GT1.  Biggest pain in the ass I've 
ever gone through.  I found that I couldn't make things work with the 
funnel sitting right in the oil-filler neck (on a 911), so I had to run a 
tube down from the funnel.  That left me holding the funnel in one hand, 
and the five quart oil container in the other, waiting while the oil 
drained down the tube.  My arm about fell off before I finished, and it 
took a LOT longer than with the twelve individual quart bottles.  The 
other problem I had was judging how much oil I'd put in as I got to the 
end--the difference between 10 and 11 quarts was hard to tell.

I've given some thought to getting together with a couple of friends and 
buying a drum of oil and one of those pump-dispensers that shops use.  
That would be the ideal solution.  The only problem is where to keep 
it--someone has to put up with four or five people doing oil changes in 
their garage....  Any volunteers in the Silicon Valley vicinity?
