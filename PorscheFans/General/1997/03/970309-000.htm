     "There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and
     mountaineering; all the rest are merely games." 
 

But does anybody know where or when he said it? Nobody seems able to point to
a page in a Hemingway story and say "here it is." It is almost like an urban
legend. Everybody "knows" he said this but nobody knows where. If anybody CAN
find the original quote, puleeeeze tell us. I looked (briefly) on the Net for
Hemingway sites that might be searchable for text, but no luck. (A while ago
I did find the original source of "First thing we do, we kill all the
lawyers" -- I knew it was Shakespeare, but now I know it is Henry VI, Act 4,
Scene 2.)

-- [ From: Jim Bergman, PorscheFans Listmaster * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Howdy y'all,

Just wanted to give you an update on the list status.  We're still having
problems with the list software, and digests intermittently don't go out. 
I've tried all kinds of remedies, but it doesn't mask some basic bugs in the
software we're using - NTMail by Internet Shopper.

So this is the plan -- I'm on vacation this coming week.  When I get back,
I'll be finding a replacement mail/list server.  There are basically three
I'm looking at: software.com's Post.Office (with a shortly to be released
list server), Lyris, and the one's that's used by C|Net (don't remember the
name offhand -- it can send 100,000 messages an hour).

The goal is to have the system replaced by the end of March.

I appreciate the feedback and patience that you've shown.  I'm not making a
politician's promise when I say, "It will get better!"
