>1st.  If you use a gasket and it still leaks oil what kind of sealer =
should be used along with the >gasket.  Can I use Loctite Orange or is =
it just for gasketless sealing?  Should I use some kind of >gasket =
cement to glue the gaskets in place before assembly or should I avoid =
their use?

Depends on what you're sealing.  I use Loctite 574 (or equiv) with and =
without paper gaskets on aluminum and steel.  For magnesium (not my =
problem...), you need an RTV such as the DC730 stuff.  I assume you've =
done a fine job of prepping (deburring, cleaning) the surface you're =
sealing.

BTW, a friend from Loctite advises of a couple new wrinkles:

1) They have a Loctite 518 which he feels is a better substitute for 574 =
in Porsche aluminum engines, etc.  (And he owns and builds Porsches...)
2) They are evaluating a new product which will substitute for the =
expensive DC730 stuff.

>2nd.  How do you tell if a ball or roller type bearing is bad?  If the =
center washer type things >separate from the bearing must the bearing be =
replaced even if it seems OK when assembled?
Check the surface of the races for pitting and material loss.  If the =
pits are 1 mm or bigger, or there are a lot of them, junk the bearing.  =
Check the rollers/needles/balls - if they are brown or dark grey, =
they're junk.  On the races, an unpitted but matte surface is fine.
>3rd.  How do you tell if the wrist pin to piston fit is OK.  If there =
is any movement at all when the >rod is twisted is that too much?  If I =
have a machine shop replace the bushings in the con rod >where the pin =
goes through can they get a tighter fit or will it end up just as loose =
as it is now or >maybe even looser if they don't do a great job?  Kind =
of the same question for valve guides as >well?

I don't know of a spec, but I'll bet there's one somewhere.  (Nice thing =
about the 911s.  After thirty years, somebody's spec'ed just about =
everything.)  The wrist pin should be quite snug in the piston bore.  =
The conn rod bushings can be replaced by a machine shop, but that won't =
tighten up the piston-to-wrist pin.

There is a spec for checking valve guide wear - check your book.  You =
lift the valve a distance from its seat, then measure radial play with a =
dial indicator.

>4th.  when they say to measure the radial play and the end play and the =
axial play just what do >they really mean?

In what context?

>5th. What do you put in the strut tube besides the strut?  Like oil, =
anti-freeze/water, or ATF, or >nothing?

Same stuff they put in golf balls.  It's radioactive acid and it will =
kill you if you try cutting one open to find out.  Honest, this happened =
to a boy in my class!
