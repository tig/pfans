There has been a fair bit of talk over the years both on PorscheFans and
Porschephiles about films with Porsches in them, but I don't ever remember
a thread about novels mentioning P-cars.

Usually they only get a cursory mention, often to re-enforce that the
driver is a rich yuppie (!)

However, I've just finished read a fairly crap adventure novel called
_Cold Cold Heart_ by James Elliott (Orion, 1994, ISBN 1-85797-868-4) and
was impressed that the 911 which features (quite a lot) in it is correctly
described, including details like the back seats folding down to make a
shelf, etc.

From the book : "The 1967 Porsche 911S Targa was a real sleeper ... the
powerful six-cylinder sports car, the last of the Porsches to be equipped
with three two-barrel carburetors ..."

I have also read a couple of novels by Dan Binchy (an Irish novellist,
related to Maeve Binchy) in which an (unspecified model) Porsche feature,
but one of them has a drawing of a 911 on the cover but the car has its
engine damaged when it goes front first into a wall!!

Are there any other novels out there with Porsches in them?
