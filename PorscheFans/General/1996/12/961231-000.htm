Yesterday the flatbed truck delivered the worst excuse for a car I've ever
tested -- a GM EV-1 electric car. Forget about the 80 mile or whatever
claimed range. 45 is more like it under real-world conditions. Would you
lease a $35,000 Pontiac Fiero with a two-gallon gas tank that could only be
refuelled at your own house using an IV drip bottle? That's what it's like. 

But wait, there's more. No sooner did I park this thing, which looks like the
evil spawn of a golf cart and a Citroen-Maserati, than my fax spit out a
press release from Ford. I'm not making this up:

FORD NEWS RELEASE
ADVISORY
FORD UNVEILS 1998 ELECTRIC RANGER TRUCK...

This opens up a whole new field of vehicle model names. A highly placed and
completely unreliable source tells us that Porsche is working on a special
model, available only in Polar Silver Metallic, to be called -- THE ICE
BOXSTER. 

Sorry. Couldn't let that one go.
