A couple of drinking buddies, who were airplane mechanics, were in the
hanger at Algeria in Africa. It was fogged in and they had nothing to
do. One said to the other, "Mon, have you got anything to drink?" "No
mon, but I hear you can drink jet fuel and that'll kinda give you a
buzz."  So, Paul and Stephen drank jet fuel, get smashed and had a great
time. The following morning, Paul woke up and figured his head would
probably start pounding as soon as he stood up.  But it didn't.  He felt
good.  In fact, he felt great - no hangover! Paul's phone rang, it was
Stephen.  Stephen asked, "Hey, how do you feel?" "I feel great!" replied
Paul. "I feel great too! You don't have a hangover?" said Stephen. "No.
That jet fuel is great stuff - no hangover.  We ought to do this more
often!" said Paul. "Yeah, we could, but there's just one thing..."
"What's that?" "Did you fart yet?" "What?" "Did you fart yet?" "No..."
"Well, don't, because I'm in London!"

A woman answered the door to a market researcher. "Good morning madam.
I'm doing some research for Vaseline. Do you use it at all in your
household?" "Oh yes, all the time. It's very good for cuts, grazes and
burns." "Do you use it for anything else?" "Like what?" "Ahem.. err..
well.. during.. ahem.. sex." "Oh, of course. Yes, we smear it on the
bedroom doorknob to keep the kids out."

A wealthy man came home from a gambling trip and told his wife that he
had lost  their entire fortune. He told her that they would have to
drastically alter their lifestyle.
"If you will just learn to cook," he said, "we can fire the chef."
"Fine," she said, "and if you learn how to make love, we can fire the
gardener."

EXERPTS FROM STEPHEN WRIGHT ....

I used to work in a fire hydrant factory. You couldn't park anywhere
near the place.

I stayed up all night playing poker with tarot cards. I got a full house
and four people died.

Last week, I went to a furniture store to look for a decaffeinated
coffee table. They couldn't help me. 

What's another word for "thesaurus"?

When I get real bored, I like to drive downtown and get a great parking
spot, then sit in my car and count how many people ask if I'm leaving. 

When I was a kid, we had a quicksand box in the backyard. I was an only
child . . eventually.

I bought some batteries, but they weren't included. So I had to buy them
again.

For my birthday I got a humidifier and a dehumidifier. I put them in the
same room and let them fight it out.

I have a switch in my apartment that doesn't do anything. Every once in
a while I turn it on and off. One day I got a call from a woman in
France who said, "Cut it out!"

I replaced the headlights on my car with strobe lights. Now it looks
like I'm the only one moving. 

I wrote a song, but I can't read music. Every time I hear a new song on
the radio, I think "Hey, maybe I wrote that."

I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose. Now when
I get pulled over the cop looks at it (moving it nearer and farther,
trying to see it clearly) . . . and says, "Here, you can go."

I went to a general store, but they wouldn't let me buy anything
specific.

I turned my air conditioner the other way around, and it got cold out.
The weatherman said, "I don't understand it. It was supposed to be 80
degrees out today." I said "Oops . . ."

I put contact lenses in my dog's eyes. They had little pictures of cats
on them. Then I took one out and he ran around in circles. 

I spilled Spot remover on my dog. Now he's gone.

My neighbor has a circular driveway. He can't get out.

I bought some powdered water, but I didn't know what to add.

I put instant coffee in a microwave and almost went back in time.

I have an answering machine in my car. It says, "I'm home now, but leave
a message and I'll call when I'm out." 

I bought a house on a one-way dead-end road..I don't know how I got
there.

A friend of mine is into Voodoo Acupuncture. You don't have to go.
You'll just be walking down the street and . . . . . oohh, that's much
better.

I have a hobby. I have the world's largest collection of sea shells. I
keep it scattered on beaches all over the world. Maybe you've seen some
of it.

I Xeroxed a mirror. Now I have an extra Xerox machine.

Last week I forgot how to ride a bicycle.

My school colors were clear.

I stayed in a really old hotel last night. They sent me a wakeup letter.

I'm taking La maze classes. I'm not having a baby, I'm just having
trouble breathing.

When I was in high school, I got in trouble with my girlfriend's Dad. He
said, "I want my daughter back by 8:15." I said, "the middle of August?
Cool!"

My girlfriend's weird. One day she asked me, "If you could know how and
when you were going to die, would you want to know?" I said, "No."  "She
said, "Okay, forget it."
