A man goes to the Doctor the with a ring around his penis.
His friend meets him in the bar.
The chap is suicidal the Doctor has told him that his penis will have to be
amputated.

What! says the friend.
I had the same problem..
Went to a private Doctor. He looked it over. Rubbed with a special lotion
and it went.
Whats his number says the first guy.

The guy goes to the private Doctor who examines the penis.
The Doctor tells him that his penis will have to be amputated.
WHAT says the guy but my mate had the same thing and you wiped it off
lotion.
There is says the Doctor a difference between lipstick and gangerine!
