	Well the situation has gotten...interesting.  It seems Priya (the
one who houses the 911) has also taken advantage of our "see anyone" 
clause in our relationship.  Which I suppose is fair because I have too. 
One night she decided that she couldn't handle it and that I was so
difficult for her, etc. etc. and I got sick of hearing that she "doesn't
care anymore."  So we worked that out and she started to spill some of her
guts.  And apparently she hooked up with a friend of hers but claims that
she likes him but not nearly as much as she likes me and doesn't expect
that to go anywhere.  Somehow Sarah (the one who likes the car) came up
and then she turned from being cold and distant to being loving and
cuddly.  Very strange girl, that one.  I confessed that right then I
really liked Sarah much more because she's nice to me and that seemed to
excite Priya even more.  *shrug*  The girl is a nutcase :)  But last night
things seemed to take a turn with her.  She's suddenly become much nicer
and a tad more caring.  Of course now, I'm busy with Sarah...
	To further complicate matters, last weekend I went upstate to
visit one of my best friends, Liza, whom I've been crazy about for years
but has had a boyfriend for the last 4 years.  Recently she's been telling
me that he's more of a friend than anything anymore so I was getting this
weird mixed signal from her.  So I took a risk, and we kissed and we've
been talking about the two of us having a relationship.  Of course she's
aware of Priya and Sarah and I think that's her major hang up.  I would
glady dump them for her (this girl is really fantastic.  Well until I
remember why it is that we sometimes bicker :)  but I suspect that she
wants me to no longer care for them and then come to her.  But i feel like
it may be an opportunity that is slipping away and I don't want it to go.
Another problem is, we don't know _how_ to go from being friends to being
more.  It sounds simple but it's weird and awkward and neither of us have
ever done it.  She brought that up and I realized I really hadn't thought
things through :)  So that's my personal soap opera.  It's even more
complicated but I'm sure I'm boring the list enough! :)

	Unfortunately with the New york metro area, it seems like weather
prediction is difficult at best.  Sometimes I really think the
weatherpeople are just guessing....But that's not what the net is for!
don't pollute our network!! :)  I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that but I've
watched the gradual decline of the net over the past 6 or 7 years and
realized that it's just getting swamped.  We just need a bigger backbone,
but technology isn't keeping up with demand quite as well as I'd hoped it
would...
