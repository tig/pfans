Heck these days going for a haircut is a last resort for me.
I need all I've got left.

If estate agents in OZ are any thing like the ones we have in the UK.
They'll overvalue your property just to get you to put it on the market. Of
course the ones that get you to wait in all day and then not turn up at all
are the worst.

Hang loose and have another beer. The computer guys arrived to install some
new software on my computer so I'll be off line for a couple of hours.

If you want a chat tell me how to fire up a chat session - if you want

I went out for a while (hour and a half) - I went to get a haircut but
she was behind and said 20 mins so I waited 25 and then left and this
morning a real estate agent put a flyer in my letterbox saying how hot
he was in sales and listed his sales so I went to his Open and said come
over at 4:15 this arvo and value my house and he said OK but didn't show
up. Sheesh!!!

Now I'm having a beer and relaxing because I've been working really hard
and I can feel the stress just starting to go now - no bull.
