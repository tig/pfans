Hi Paul,

I'll stick to Cognac in future. The Brandy is not to bad. Being stuck in the
middle of nowhere make you appreciate the little things you take for granted
more.

Yes. I'm on contract out in Nigeria at the moment. On a refinery on the
coast in Delta State on  a 5 weeks on 5 weeks off rotation. I am driving a
CADD computer in the office apart from a day offshore every fortnight or so.
I am based on the coast at the Escravos refinery, the nearest town is 40
miles away by ......Boat. Luckily this place also has a Twin engined DH
OTTER, a PLATYPUS float plane and 8 helicopters. So the dugout canoes have
not been used...... so far.

Yes I gather the rand is low. The chap that takes my place (Colin) while I'm
on leave is from South Africa. I have been working oversea's a number of
years now. I am only a allowed a certain amount of time in the UK for Tax
reasons so I spend a lot of my leave outside the UK. For example. Myself and
bunch of mates are planning a river rafting trip on the Zambsee in July.

One of these days I'll great around to getting around to visiting Oz. One of
my best mates now lives in CRAIGIE, PERTH. I've also got relations living
over there.

Try Cognac instead.  Now that'll make those 2 weeks shorter for sure!

I think Brandy usually has a screw cap and cognac has a cork wih a
plastic end on it.  The cork seals quite well.

I don't think anyone tampered with your Brandy - they'd probably just
take the whole thing rather than hassling around with substituting the
contents - unless they were stark raving mad, of course.

Are you on a contract in Africa?  The Rand is low compared to the dollar
isn't it?
