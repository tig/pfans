Ladies and gentlemen:

We've all been whining about the lack of a searchable archive for the
PorscheFans mailing lists, right? Our listmaster doesn't appear to be too
interested in providing us with one, right? So what should we do about it?

Well I know what *I* did about it. I created a fully functional, rich, easy
to use full-text search engine for the archives for all of the PorscheFans
mailing lists. And I'm making it available to everyone. Why did I do this?
Because it was there and it was a challenge!

Please go to http://www.kindel.com/porsche/pfans and check it out for
yourself. If you like it, let me know. If you don't, let me know.

Please don't reply to this mail (this address is not monitored by a human).
If you want to provide me with feedback on what I've done, send mail to me
at ckindel@microsoft.com.

Enjoy!
