	Yeah I figure that the only people I really allow to drive my 911
is the dealership's service department and then only because I'm not
allowed to drive it through their garage :)  Although they do let me
wander through their garage and look at all the work they are doing on
other cars.  Sort of interesting to see since I never get to do work on my
car myself - just don't have a lift to put the car on.  
	Eventually I expect to move the car to a garage in Manhattan.
Assuming of course, that I can find one where I can park the car myself in
a safe location.  I guess for now, I'll just commute to New Jersey via the
NJ Transit.  At least I'm getting a warm reception for now...
