JULIE THE BLONDE (2)


Julie the blonde runs crying into the office.
"Whatever is wrong?" gasps her best friend Carol.

"It's my boyfriend Paul the PORSCHE DRIVER" gushes Julie. "He was working on
the back engine in the boot of his 911 when the lid came down and cut off a
finger!"

"My god" shreeks Carol. "It didn't amputate his WHOLE finger!"

"No thank godness" sniffs Julie. "But it was the one just next to it!"






THE PORSCHE DRIVER (1)

The PORSCHE DRIVER and his girlfriend Julie are on vacation in the states.
They decide to visit Yellowstone park. Wandering through the glades they
come across a baby skunk.

"Oh look at it Paul." Gushes Julie. "They're not the least bit like the
stories. They're all soft cute and cuddly. Can we keep him?'

"If you must." Sighs the PORSCHE DRIVER. "Good thing we've left my 911 at
home. We'd have never been able to fit both him and your vanity case in
that."

They are sneaking back to hire car when the PORSCHE DRIVER spots a park
ranger in the distance.

"Quick." He hisses "Hide the Skunk".
"There's nowhere". Gushes Julie.
Quick as a flash the PORSCHE DRIVER shoves the Skunk up the front of Julie's
dress. "Uuuuhhh." Whines Julie. "But what about the appalling smell?"

"The Skunk". Says the PORSCHE DRIVER. "Will just have to hold its breath".
