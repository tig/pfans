 check out that website. If I'm still sober enough to operate my PC.
 


The guy in Australia replies:

I reckon Australia must be god's country because we get pissed here all
the time!
In fact the local natives (aborigines) do it all day and all night on
their royalty cheques that they get because they were here first.  It's
quite a scene to behold mainly because of their facial features - it's
like being in that movie where that woman went into the jungle and lived
with the gorillas - oh yeah "Gorillas in the Mist".  They keep to
themselves but they live in the main street and in the mall and parks. 
The local supermarkets keep methylated spirits under the front counter
and you have to have a good reason to buy one.  I'm not being
anti-racial because I'm not but that's the way it is.  To them it's
god's country because there's an endless supply of money, which they
plough back into the local communities with great skill.

Anyone else experienced/experiencing that?
