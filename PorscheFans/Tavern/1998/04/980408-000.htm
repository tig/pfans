G'day Vijay,

Does this mean you're still with the same one?

How did your trip to the other one go?

And, re your email:
Well I know I'm jealous!
Yep - sounds OK to me too - wouldn't mind seeing a photo of that - the 3
of them sitting there strutting their stuff

My car is sitting an hour away from me in sunny edison, NJ while I sit
here at my desk in NYC.  I'm really looking forward to getting a hold of
it this weekend ... 
Yes, and it's Easter so you have four fabulous days of cruising (at
least) - I'm washing, polishing, maintaining and then cruising.

 ... if I can although I'm not sure I have a ride from the train station
to my car...Oh well, if the weather on the east coast holds up, it will
be well worth it!
You can check the weather by looking at the satellite pictures and also
getting the aviation weather forecasts (very accurate) and then you'll
have a fairly solid view of how the weather is going to behave - use the
Net to get that info, that's what it's for (partly)
.
