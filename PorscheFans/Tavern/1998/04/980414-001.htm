> THE NEW PRIEST
>
> A new priest at this first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.
After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.  The monsignor
replied,
"When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of
vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice.  At the beginning of
the
sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a
storm.
Upon return to his office after mass, he found the following note on his
door.
>
> 1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
> 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
> 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10
> 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
> 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
> 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.
> 7.  The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior
and Spook.
> 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
> 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say
he
was stoned off his ass.
> 10. We do not refer to the cross as the Big T!
> 11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "take this
and
eat it, for it is my body", he did not say "Eat Me."
> 12. The Virgin Mary is not referred to as the, Mary with the Cherry".
> 13. The recommended grace before a meal it not: "Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks
for the grub, yeah God!"
> 14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy-pulling contest at St. Peter's,
not
a peter-pulling contest at St. Taffy's.
>
> The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to
everyone who passes it on.  Forward it to your friends to whom you wish
good luck.  You will see that something good happens to you four days
from
now.
