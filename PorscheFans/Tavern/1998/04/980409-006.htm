BARBIE

Ralph was driving home one evening when he suddenly realizes
that it's his daughter's birthday and he hasn't bought her a
present.

He drives to the mall, runs to the toy store and says to the
shop assistant, "How much is that Barbie in the window?"

In a condescending manner, she says "Which Barbie?"  She
continues, "We have Barbie Goes to the Gym for $19.95, Barbie
Goes to the Ball for $19.95, Barbie Goes Shopping for $19.95,
Barbie Goes to the Beach  for $19.95, Barbie Goes Nightclubbing
for $19.95, and Divorced Barbie  for $265.00".

Ralph asks, "Why is the Divorced Barbie $265.00 when all the
others are  only $19.95?"

"That's obvious" the sales lady says.  "Divorced Barbie comes
with Ken's house, Ken's car, Ken's boat, Ken's furniture.
