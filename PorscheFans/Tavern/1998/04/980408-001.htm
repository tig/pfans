>The following is an excerpt taken from a Wall Street Journal
>article:
>
>An AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective
>diskettes.  A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along
>with photocopies of the floppies.
>
>Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to
>"Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any"
>key is.
>
>AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse
>was hard to control with the dust cover on.  The cover turned out to be
>the  plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.
>
>Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining
>that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old
>diskettes.
>After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the
>problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then
>rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.
>
>A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy
>back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to
>hold
>on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the
>room
>to close the door to his room.
>
>Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax
>anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician
>discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in
>front
>of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.
>
>Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no
longer
>worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap
>and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the
>keys and washing them individually.
>
>A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged
>because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid". The tech
>explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid" responses
>shouldn't
>be taken personally.
>
>A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He
told
>the technician that the computer had said it "couldn't find printer".
>The user had tried turning the computer screen to face the printer -
>but still said that his computer still couldn't  "see" the printer.
>
>An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her
new
>Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in,
>the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power
>button.
>Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing
>happens."
>The "foot pedal" turned out to be the computer's mouse.
>
>Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand new
>computer wouldn't work.
>She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20
>minutes waiting for something to happen.
>When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she
>asked "What power switch?"
>
>True story from a Novell NetWare SysOp: Caller: "Hello, is this
>Tech Support?" Tech:    "Yes, it is. How may I help you?"
>Caller:  "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty
>period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"
>Tech:    "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"
>Caller:  "Yes,  it's attached to the front of my computer."
>Tech:    "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, It's because I am.
>How did you get this cup holder? Did you receive this as part of a
>promotional, at a trade show? Does it have any trademark on it?"
>Caller:   "It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a
>promotional. It just has '4X' on it."
>At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't
>stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load
>drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the
>drive!
>
>Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang for
>support.
>"I put in the first disk, and that was OK.  It said to put in the
second
>disk, and
>had some problems with the disk. When it said to put in the third disk
-
>I couldn't even fit it in...
>" The user hadn't realized that "Insert Disk 2" meant to remove Disk 1
>first.
>
>In a similar incident, a customer had followed the instructions for
>installing software.  The instructions said to remove the disk from
it's
>cover and insert into the drive.  The user had physically removed the
>casing of the disk and wondered why there were problems.

Sneezing
 A man and a woman are riding on a plane next to each other in first
 class.  The man sneezes, pulls out his penis and wipes the tip off.
The woman can't believe what she just saw and decides she is
hallucinating. A few minutes pass. The man sneezes again.  He pulls
out his penis and wipes the tip off. The woman is about to go nuts.
She can't believe that such a rude person exists. A few minutes pass.
The man sneezes yet again.  He takes his penis out and wipes the
tip off. The woman has finally had enough.

She turns to the man and says, "Three times you've sneezed, and three
times you've removed your penis from your pants to wipe it off! What
the hell kind of degenerate are you?"

The man replies, "I am sorry to have disturbed you, ma'am.  I have a
very rare condition such that when I sneeze, I have an orgasm."

The woman then says, "Oh, how strange.  What are you taking for it?"

The man looks at her and says, "Pepper."

 ......................................................

 Shopping
 A man shopping in a supermarket brought his purchase of two cans of
dog food to the checkout counter. The cashier asked, "Sir, do you
have a dog?"

"Yes." replied the man.

"Well, where is it?" asked the cashier. "I left him home." he
answered.

"Sorry," the cashier said, "You can't buy the dog food if I
can't see the dog. That's the rules."

The next day he returned to the store and brought some cat food to
the checkout.

"Do you have a cat?" asked the cashier.

"Yes," he said, "but I left him home."

"Sorry," she said, "If I can't see the cat, I can't sell you the
food. That's the rules."

The next day the man walked into the store with a brown paper bag. He
walked up to the cashier and said, "Here. Put your hand in here."

The cashier put her hand in and said, "It's soft and warm. What is
it?"

The man replied, "I'd like three rolls of toilet paper!"

 The Husband
A man was approached by a co-worker at lunch who invited him out for
a few beers after work.  The man said that his wife would never
go for it,that she does not allow him to go drinking with the guys
after work.The co-worker suggested a way to overcome that problem:
"When  you get home tonight, sneek into the house, slide down under
the sheets, gently pull down your wife's panties, and give her
oral sex.  Women love it, and believe me, she'll never mention
that you were out late with the boys".

So the man agreed to try it, and went out and enjoyed himself. Late
that night, he sneeked into the house, slid down under the
sheets, gently slid down his wife's panties, and gave her oral
sex.  She moaned and groaned with pleasure, but after a little
while, he realized he had to take a leak, so he told her he'd be
right back, got out of bed and walked down  the hall to the bathroom.
 When he opened the door and went in, he was very surprised to see
his wife sitting on the john.

"How did you get in here?" he asked.

"Shhhhhhh!!" she replied, "you'll wake my Mother"!!!!
