     Teacher asks the class to use the word contagious.

     First kid stands up and says "last year I got the measles and mum said
     it was very contagious. "

     Next kid gets up and says " Nan says there is a flu going round and it
     is contagious"
     And of course little Johnny has to put his two cents worth in "Our
     next door neighbour is painting his house with a two inch brush and my
     dad says it will take the contagious."

     There was a City fan with a really crappy seat at Maine Road.
 Looking
     with his binoculars he spotted an empty seat on the half way line.
    Thinking to himself "what a waste" he made his way down to the empty
     seat.

    When he arrived at the seat, he asked the man sitting next to it,
 "Is  this seat taken?"

     The man replied, "This was my wife's seat. She passed away. She wasa
     big City fan."

     The other man replied, "I'm so sorry to hear of your loss. May I ask
     you why you didn't give the ticket to a friend or a relative?"

    The man replied, "They're all at the funeral."

     Two deaf people get married.  During the first week of marriage,they
    find that they are unable to communicate in the bedroom when they turn
off the lights because they can't see each other using sign language.

     After several nights of fumbling around and misunderstandings, the
     wife decides to find a solution.
     "Honey," she signs, "Why don't we agree on some simple signals?
     For instance, at night, if you want to have sex with me, reach over
     and squeeze my left breast one time.  If you don't want to have sex,
     reach over and squeeze my right breast one time."

     The husband thinks this is a great idea and signs back to his wife,
     "Great idea, Now if you want to have sex with ME, reach over and pull
    on my penis one time.  If you don't want to have sex, reach over and
     pull on my penis....... fifty times".

     A Briton, a Frenchman and a Russian are viewing a painting of Adam and
     Eve frolicking in the Garden of Eden.>
     "Look at their reserve, their calm," muses the Brit. "They must be
     British."

     "Nonsense," the Frenchman disagrees. "They're naked, and so
 beautiful.
    Clearly, they are French."

     "You are both wrong" the Russian points out, "No clothes, no
 shelter,
     they have only an apple to eat, and they're being told this is
     paradise. They are Russian."

     St. Peter is standing at the Pearly Gates one day when up walks a
 group
of forty scousers. St. Peter tells them that there isn't enough room for
them all and goes off to ask God him which ones he should let in.

     "Pick the ten most righteous. They shall enter Heaven !!" says God.

    Ten minutes later Peter comes back to God, "They're gone !!" heexclaims.

    "What, all forty ??" says God.
  "Not the scousers" says Peter "The gates....!!"

Two engineering students meet on campus one day.  The first
engineer calls out ot the other, "Hey-Nice bike!  Where did
you get it?"  "Well," replied the other, "I was walking to
class the other day when this pretty, young co-ed rode up
on this bike.  She jumped off, took off all of her clothes,
and said, "'You can have ANYTHING you want!!!'"  "Good
choice," said the first, "her clothes wouldn't have fitted
you anyway."

A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office.
After the check-up, the doctor took the wife aside and told
her, "If you don't do the following, your husbnd will lose
his will to live and surely die."
1.  Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast and send him
off to work in a good mood.
2.  At lunch time, make him a warm, nutritious meal and put
him in a good frame of mind before he goes back to work.
3.  For dinner, fix especially nice meals selected from his
favorite foods and don't burden him with household chores
or problems.
4. Make love with him several times a week and satisfy his
every sexual whim.

On the way home, the husband asked his wife what the doctor
had told her.  She replied "You're going to die".

Two missionaries in Africa were apprehended by a tribe of
very hostile cannibals who put them in a large pot of
water, built a huge fire under it, and left them there.  A
few minutes later, one of the missionaries started to laugh
uncontrollably.  The other missionary can't believe it!  He
said, "What's wrong with you?  We're being boiled alive!
They're gonna eat us!  What could possibly be funny at a
time like this?"  The other missionary said, "I just peed
in the soup!"

Two nuns are ordered to paint a room in the convent, and
the last instruction of the Mother Superior was that they
must not get even a drop of paint on their habits.
After conferring about this for a while, the two nuns
decide to lock the door of the room, strip off their
habits, and paint in the nude.  In the middle of the
project, there was a knock at the door.  "Who is it?"
called on of the nuns.
"Blind man," replied a voice from the other side of the
door.  The two nuns looked at each other and shrugged,
deciding that no harm can come from letting a blind man
into the room; they open the door.  "Nice boobs," said the
man.  "Where do you want these blinds?"

There was a farmer who grew watermellons,  He was doing
pretty well, but he was disturbed by some local kids who
would sneak into his watermellon patch at night and eat his
watermellons.  After some careful thought, he came up with
a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for
sure.
He made up a sign and posted it in the field.  The next
day, the kids show up and they saw the sign which read:
"Warning! One of the watermellons in this field has been
injected with cyanide."  The kids run off, made up their
own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign.  When the
farmer returned, he surveyed the field.  He noticed that no
watermellons were missing, but the sign next to his read:
"Now there are two!!!"

Pinnochio was receiving complaints from his girlfriend
about consummating their passions.  "Every time we make
love," she said, "I get splinters!"  So he went back to his
maker, Gipetto, the carpenter, to ask for advice.

"Sandpaper my boy, that's what you need," was the
carpenter's response.  A couple of weeks later the
carpenter saw Pinnochio again, "How are you getting on with
the girls now?"
"Who needs girls?" replied Pinnochio.

   The butcher dance.

     A middle aged socialogist has undertaken a lifelong dream to film
     every kind of dance to determine it's influence on society structure
     and evolution, whilst in Australia filmingnative dances he meets a
     young Aborigine in a bar.  After a few beers he tells the young man
     about his world wide travels around Europe, North America, South
     America, Africa, the Middle East and the Far East filming indigenous
     dances of all the different cultures and how he only now needs to film
     the native dances of Australia to complete his life's work and dream.
     The young man then says:-

     "Ah well have you seen the Butcher dance yet?"

     "The Butcher dance?, no I've never heard of it" he replies.

     "Well you can't leave Australia until you've seen it, it's the most
     ancient and sacred of my culture's dances!" says the Aborigine.

     "Look pal I've seen every kind of dance of every culture on this
     planet from the rain dance of the Apache of America to the courtship
     dance of the Zulus of Africa and I've never heard of any Butcher
     dance!, you've got to be pulling my leg!" replies tha man.

     "Nah, Nah man, I'm serious There's a village about 300miles from here
     that still perform the dance and I'm sure they won't mind if you film
     it, because it is an important part of Aborigine culture!" replies the
     aborigine.

     "Well if it's that important to the Aboriginal society I have to have
     to complete my life's work!, tell how to get there!"

     "All right, you take the road out of town south for 126miles untill
     you see a dirt road fork off to the left and then you drive down there
     for another 150miles unitll you reach the dead gum tree, you can't
     miss it it's the biggest tree you ever saw.  Then at the tree you dump
     your car, cos' from then on it's much too rough to drive and you walk
     south-west for one and a half days untill you reach a large smooth
     rock about 12 feet high then you go west for half a day to the
     mountain pass.  The pass is real rough and difficult to get through so
     be careful, it should take a couple of days to get through the pass,
     then once you're through go due south for 5miles and there's the
     village!."

     "Thank you!, with the butcher dance on film my work will be complete!"
     says the man.

     So the very next day he sets off in his car down the south road out of
     town, after exactly 126miles he sees a dirt track heading off from the
     road, the track is pretty rough so the car is only crawling down it.
     Eventually he reaches the dead gum tree and as the guide said it is
     far too rough to continue driving so he grabs his supplies and camera
     and sets off for the rock after two days of trekking through the bush
     he reaches the rock and seeing the mountains ahead he heads for the
     pass.

     As the guide said the pass is treacherous indeed and it takes him a
     long time to cautiously pick his way through the mountains, untill
     eventually he emerges on the other side.  Sensing he is nearly there
     he rushes the 5miles to the village.

     Upon reaching the village he meets the chief and asks

     "Is this the village where you perform the butcher dance?"

     "Yes!" replies the chief "But you're too late we held the dance last
     night!"

     "But I've come so far couldn't you just do the butcher dance one more
     time for my camera tonight as I need it to complete my life's work of
     cataloging all the world's dances?!" he pleads

     "Sorry mate but we can only hold one dance a year other wise the gods
     get very angry and will smash our village with wind, rain and
     lightning.  We have to perform the dance once a year to ask the gods
     to protect our village for a year but we can't do more than ona a
     year!" replies the chief.

     Dejected the man stays the night at the village and then after
     resupplying heads back home determined to return the next year to see
     and film the dance.

     Nearly a year later he returns to Australia with two crewmen to help
     him catalogue this important dance.  They arrive at the town two weeks
     early quite willing to stay at the village for a week just to be sure
     of filming the dance.  They set off, however when they reach the dirt
     track the elements are against them thunder and lightning roar as the
     rain pours down turning the dirt track into a mud soup that causes
     their offroad vehicle to get stuck every few miles.  After a long haul
     they eventually reach the dead gum tree and abandon their vehicle and
     set off on foot.

     The heavy rain and wind slows their progress to the rock and when they
     reach it they are so exhuasted they have to rest for a full day to
     regain their strength.  As they set off for the mountain pass they
     weather eases up and they reach the pass quite quickly.

     They begin to travel cautiously through the pass but as soon as they
     start the weather worsens terribly, howling gales and torrential rain
     beat them against the rock faces at times stopping their progress
     completely as it would be suicide to attempt to continue in the face
     of such elements.  At one point one of the crew slips and nearly falls
     from the mountain and is only just saved by the other crew man.
     Unfortunately he sprains his ankle in the slip which slows the others
     down to his pace.  they eventually emerge on the other side of the
     mountains with no idea of how long they were stuck on the treacherous
     slopes.

     With an incredible sense of urgency they race to the village in fear
     that they have missed the dance.  When they reach the village the man
     rushes to see the chief asking

     "The dance, the dance have I miss the butcher dance?"

     "No, no you're just in time we're holding the dance tonight just set
     up your equipment out of the way so that you don't interfere the
     ceremony!" replies the chief.

     Later that night the man and his crew set up their equipment knowing
     that they will be the first white men to see and film this incredible
     dance of aboriginal culture.

     There is a air of excitment in the village all day as people prepare
     for the dance, the women prepare their eloborate headdresses and the
     young men of the village adorn their bodies with white paint in
     intricate designs.

     A huge bonfire is built and lit in the centre of the village, the
     young men encircle the fire and then the women walk forward in a lin
     and encircle the men.  The women then walk in towards the fire and
     stand in the gaps between the men such that there is a circle of men
     and women alternating around the fire.  All appears to be ready, there
     is a deadly silence around the people.

     The man turns to an old aborigine besides him and asks when does the
     dance start.  The old man says:

     "SHHH!, quiet don't interrupt the dance or you will anger the gods.
     The dancers are redy but the chief must direct the dance to tell the
     gods what we need in the coming year to preserve our village, he will
     tell the dancers how to dance and they will follow, just keep filming
     and you will see the spectacle of the butcher dance!"

     The chief emerges from a large hut nearby, adorned in warpaint and a
     huge headdress, escorted by four large warriors.  They walk up to the
     fire and the chief begins to chant quietly to himself at first then
     louder and louder untill eventually he stops and calls out:

     "You butcher left arm in, you butcher left arm out.........!"
