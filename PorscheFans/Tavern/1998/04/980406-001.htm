> A magazine ran a "Dilbert quotes" contest.  These are actual quotes
> from managers out there.
> 
> ===================================================
> 
> As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building
> using individual security cards.  Pictures will be taken next
> Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks.  
> (This was the winning quote, from Charles Hurst at Sun Microsysytems.)
> 
> What I need is a list of specific unknown problems we will encounter.
> 
> How long is this Beta guy going to keep testing our stuff?
> 
> E-Mail is not to be used to pass on information or data.  It should be
> used only to be used for company business.
> 
> Turnover is good for the company, as it proves that we are doing a
> good job in training people.
> 
> This project is so important, we can't let things that are more
> important interfere with it.
> 
> Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule.
> 
> No one will believe you solved this problem in one day!  We've been
> working on it for months.  Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I'll
> let you know when it's time to tell them.
