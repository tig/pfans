An elaborated version of this is on Ed Yourdon's homepage at:

His "Road Warrior" stories really hit home if you travel much (which I take it you do).

============================
BASIC RULES FOR DRIVING IN METRO ATLANTA
1-- A right lane construction closure is just a game to see how many
people can cut in line by passing you on the right as you sit in the
left lane waiting for the same jerks to squeeze their way back in before
hitting construction barrels.
2-- Turn signals are just clues as to your next move in road battle so
never use them.
3-- Under no circumstances should you leave a safe distance between you
and the car in front of you no matter how fast you're going.  If you do,
the space will be filled in by somebody else putting you in an even more
dangerous situation.
4-- Large SUV drivers think they're immortal, (especially if they have
4WD); don't succumb to the temptation to test this theory.
5-- The faster you drive through a red light, the smaller the chance you
have of getting hit.
6-- Never get in the way of a car that needs extensive body work.
(Remember no-fault insurance, he might not have much to lose, you do.)
7-- Braking is to be done as hard and late as possible to insure that
your ABS kicks in giving a nice relaxing foot massage as the brake pedal
pulsates.
8-- Construction signs tell you about road closures immediately after
you pass the exit before the traffic begins to back up.
9-- The new electronic traffic warning system signs are not there to
provide useful information, just to make Atlanta look high-tech.
10-- Never pass on the left when you can pass on the right.  It's a good
way to scare people entering the highway.
11-- Speed limits are arbitrary figures, given only as suggestions and
apparently not enforceable in the metro area during rush hour.
12-- Just because you're in the left lane and have no room to speed up
or move over doesn't mean that a Atlanta driver flashing his high beams
behind you doesn't think he can go faster in your spot.
13-- Please remember that there is no such thing as a shortcut during
rush-hour traffic in Atlanta.
14-- Always slow down and rubberneck when you see an accident or even a
person changing a tire.  It might be more interesting than the articles
in last week's National Enquirer.
15-- Throwing litter on the roads adds variety to the landscape, keeps
the existing litter from getting lonely and gives Adopt-a-highway crews
something to clean up.
16-- Everybody thinks their vehicle is better than yours, (especially
pickup truck drivers with stickers of Calvin peeing on a Ford, Dodge or
Chevy logo).
17-- Learn to swerve abruptly.  Atlanta is the home of high-speed slalom
driving thanks to GDOT, which puts potholes in key locations to test
drivers' reflexes and keep them on their toes.
18-- It is traditional in Atlanta to honk your horn at cars that don't
move the instant the light changes.  This is a drag race isn't it?
19-- When the light turns green, put the pedal to the metal; gas is
cheap in Atlanta, pollution is a myth, and this is a drag race isn't it?
20-- Seeking eye contact with another driver revokes your right of way.
21-- Never take a green light at face value.  Always look right and left
before proceeding.
22-- Remember that the goal of every Atlanta driver is to get there
first, by whatever means necessary.
AND DON'T FORGET!  YOU MIGHT AS WELL STAY AT HOME IF IT'S RAINING OR
SNOWING  - OR SUNNY FOR THAT MATTER!
