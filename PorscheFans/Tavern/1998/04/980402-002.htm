With two weeks left before I go on field break I bought a bottle of Brandy
to cheer myself up. Needless to say it was not from a shop as they aren't
any in the S***HOLE were I am.
When I inspected it the whole top unscrewed from the bottle.
On closer inspection it smelled weak.
On tasting it was both sweet and not quite as strong as I thought it should
be.
Though its not exactly weak as...'or like drinking piss'.
I can't get out of my mind the possibility that I actually have
been....................

Stuck in Africa.
Still........and not sure if I want to finish the brandy.
