1) Valet Parking

I NEVER trust Valet Parkers.  They are Road Warriors with attitude. 
Eddie Murphy said it in Beverly Hills Cop "... this s**t happened when I
parked here last time ... " about his wreck-of-a-car to a stunned-mullet
valet dude.  It was a gag in the movie but it illustrates a point, which
is why it was funny I spose.

So, Vijay, never trust those guys.  I don't even trust the Tyre Guys. 
When I got new rubber last year I said "I'm driving it on and off the
hoist myself" and they said (gulp) "OK".  I said I didn't trust most
people with my car and anyway they just play with the alarm - "VIPER
ARMED!", etc. I grew up in a quiet family so I can't relate to that at
all.

2) Black Eye

A friend met another friend who had a black eye.  He asked, "How did you
get the black eye?"  He answered "It was in Church on Sunday.  We were
all there and then it came time to pray so we all kneeled and prayed and
when we stood up to sing a hymn I noticed that the young woman in front
had got her dress caught in the crack in her bum, so I leaned forward
and pulled it out for her.  She turned around and socked me in the eye,
hence the shiner."  "Oh, sorry to hear that" and they went their
separate ways.
The following week, same guys met up, the one with the black eye had a
second black eye and his friend asked "How the geezus did that
happen??"  "Well, same church, same woman, we knelt for prayer, then
stood up to sing a hymn and the fellow next to me noticed her dress
caught in her bum and leaned forward and pulled it out and I know she
doesn't like that so I poked it back in and that's how it happened!"

3) Another Golfing Story

3 guys playing golf.  First one tees off and his ball goes into the
rough.  Second guy, his ball in the rough too.  Third guy, tees off, on
the green in one, struts down proudly, pops it in with a second hit and
waits for his 2 friends.  Time goes by and the 2 friends don't show up. 
He goes over to the rough and there they are, one on top of the other. 
He says in amazement, "What the hell is going in here!" The first guy
says "He had a heart attack."  The third guy says "You're supposed to
give mouth-to-mouth for that"  The first guy says "I know - how do you
thing this started!"
