Oh, ignore them .. they are just blowing hot exhaust through a
leak in their manifolds.

I have DSS, with Speedvision (the "why" I got DSS) -- which
comes only in the Sports Choice package -- which "Requires a
phone connection, or else ...". -- which I never got around to
wiring in.

For the last year and a half, my DSS set pro'lly is under the
impression that "something is temporarily wrong with the phone
line". But it has never once complained.
