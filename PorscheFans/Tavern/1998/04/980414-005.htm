	To add another tale to my ever tangled web of girls who do and
don't like my Porsche.  I spent the weekend in Baltimore, visiting Sarah,
the one who likes the Porsche.  What a beautiful weekend that was!  The
weather on the east coast was just soo perfect out there, save the
annoying pollen allergy problem :).  So I wrapped up that weekend, went
back to New Jersey to Priya, the one who houses the Porsche.  She just got
her BMW 328i convertible back from the shop (some guy rear ended her car
at about 50mph in January and just WRECKED the backend.  It was only 6
months old too!) and shockingly, she didn't mind letting me leave my car
in her garage spot even though I fully expected to have to leave it
outside.  I think the only thing she was angry about was that I blew by
her on route 18 on my way in :)  I finally settled on a radio station,
shifted down to 4th and gave it a bit of gas.  It's funny how those things
just seem so comfortable around 90mph...:)  Of course I didn't recognize
that it was she whom I was blowing away on the highway.  I was just happy
to be driving.   Her parents having left for the month, she wasn't so
paranoid and was incredibly nice to me.  It's such a change!  For the past
3.5 months I've been struggling with what seemed to be a dead relationship
and now she's made a 180.  Then she decided to say "I want you to dump
Sarah and only go out with me."  woops :)  She's really pulling some power
moves to get me to pick her over Sarah, especially when it comes to who
visits next weekend.  Sarah and I have been talking about her visiting and
Priya has decided that she wants to visit instead.  It's almost like I
can't say no to someone who's been so nice to me but then I remember how
much of a pain she can be.  I figure I'll swing things her way on the
understanding that if she stands me up this time, she should never call me
again.  Of course, then I might want to find a new home for the
car...anyone know of a good garage in Manhattan that lets you park the car
yourself?  (I just don't trust the valets yet)
