	Not that it's my business but YACK!  Don't go BMW!!  I actually
have a BMW and a Porsche and the Porsche is so much more fun.  Of course,
the BMW is a more practical car because it is big and can haul a lot of
people and stuff, so if that's a concern, then obviously a little 911
isn't going to do you a lot of good.
