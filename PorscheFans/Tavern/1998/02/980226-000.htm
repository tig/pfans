Did you know that a picture of your Porsche isn't yours to do with as you
will? For 1998 Brown Trout Publishers, a West Coast company that
specializes in printing "theme" calendars (all one kind of cat, all one
kind of bird, car, etc.) published a Calendar entitled "Porsches". The
photographer, Dan Lyons, an Albany, NY-area guy, assembled gorgeous pix of
a dozen different Porsche models, all buffed to the 9s, including one of a
PCNA regional rep's car, and another which was supplied by PCNA itself. The
calendar is neat, a great way to celebrate the marque. It's available
through (at least) Borders Books & Music, among other places. (Besides
that, my wife's car is Miss May; I bought six, besides the one they gave me.) 

Now, the rest of the story. Porsche AG sicced its legal department on Brown
Trout, claiming it had made unauthorized commercial use of its trademarks,
namely, the car designs and the Porsche crest visible in the car shots!
Even though it didn't own the car any longer, it claimed that it controlled
the right to use the image for commercial purposes! I think that's outrageous.

Brown Trout tried to play good citizen, apologized and applied for a
license to cover production of the 1999 version, which goes to press at the
end of next month. Porsche AG, in a letter from one of its paralegals,
denied the application, and gave no reason. As a result, Brown Trout is
about to drop a very worthwhile product from its line.

One would think, although Porsche obviously doesn't, that a high-quality
publication featuring its products, widely distributed, and valued by
consumers, would result in enhanced visibility for the marque, wider
exposure to the general public, and an improved market climate. Wouldn't
you think so? This has to rank up there as one of the dumber moves made by
Porsche AG lately.

I found out about this when Dan Lyons called to ask for support from PCA.
I'm not part of the PCA leadership, but I gave him some names to call. If
you agree with me, e-mail/call/write Fred Schwab, president of PCNA, and
let him know your opinion.
