	Well..that's _one_ idea :)  I was thinking maybe something totally
non-criminal.  Depending on response of course...I'm thinking it might be
difficult to find parking for a lot of Porsches in NYC.  I'm still not too
thrilled about having a valet drive my car (in fact, I have yet to let
anyone else drive it :).  I live in Manhattan, although my car is living
in New Jersey right now.  Is there a track somewhere nearby?  We could all
go out to a bar or a restaurant in Manhattan.  I'd definitely be game for
that.  But we'd have to do something about parking I'm sure.  Although
right now, it's just the two of us, so maybe it won't be that tough :)
