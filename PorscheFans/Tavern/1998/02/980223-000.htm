Hey Vijay,

G'day mate.

" ... I'm curious to find out how many people here live in NYC?"

I don't.  (That's one you don't have to wait around for on the
night/afternoon.)

What will you do on that day when you meet in NYC?  If you get 50
responses (that would be BIG) then only about 20-30 will actually turn
up (still BIG).  Plus one or two strays.  Will you go to a Bar or a
Restaurant or a Speedway?  Or all of the above?  Might get a cohesive
bunch who just meld and go from there.

Anyway, why meet up in person?  It's easier on the Net.

But I wish you well in your endeavour.

Paul

P.S. Gosh, it IS quiet out there.


Additional Message:
I get people in other cars trying to drag me off at the lights.  I'm
into it though.  Even with full fuel (90 litres) I can take them.  BUT,
the big bikes cream me every time and they love it.  I console myself by
knowing if they have a wobbly then they're going to "grow" tarmac out of
their nostrils while I might screech and skid a little (just a little),
re-gain total control and composure and then roar off (you know the note
of the exhaust) to my desto.  (Hey, that desto could be the supermarket
but even a trip out shopping is a gas in a 911).
The other day I innocently pulled up at a red light int the left lane in
a 3-lane situation and a Toyota V6 was in the middle and a 5-litre
Holden (GMH) on the right.  I pulled away in the usual manner and the V6
was still there so I put my foot to the floor (still in 1st) and the V6
stayed a while then while his first "ran out" mine was climbing up thru
4,000 - 4,500 - 5,000 rpm and I kept it there until around 6,000 rpm amd
then selected second but by then the "competiton" was is my rear view so
I topped out and slowed down on the revs and then re-gained total
control and composure and proceeded to my desto.
Anyone else do that on a regular basis?
