I thought this was a forum for non-P related items

I have to say I am working my a... off these days (wish I was working my
stomach off!)

I heard some good Irish jokes the other day

Anyone feeling chatty?

My friend has gone to NZ to walk the Milford Sound and I'm REALLY BUSY
doing what I do so I'm back to batchelorhood momentarily and it has it's
good points too I suppose

Is anyone else's health suffering due to overwork?

Does anyone else cook their own dinner because the restaurants aren't
just what you'd like?

Is anyone else in the same kind of predicament?

Please respond if you've got time
.
