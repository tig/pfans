Just to let you know, and since I've been working my a.. off (wish I was
working my stomach off!!), someone sent me an invite to a Wine Options
night.  A team of 4, $15 each, NO lables on any bottles so it's "steady
as she goes" I suppose, and I don't care if there's a prize or not. 
However, I wouldn't mind winning.

I was invited to join the team and I'd say it's because I have had so
much experience with wines (a daily love affair) that I was considered
for a coveted position with 3 others.

It's the usual thing, is this red or white, is it a riesling or a
chardonnay, was it grown on the south side of the hill, did the
winemaker's daughter have big t..s, etc, etc, you know.  All those
things.

This relates to P-Cars because I'm going to leave mine at home and get a
Private Hire Car that night.  It's $8 from my house into town (3 miles)
but I always give them 10 and also last week I went on a bit of a night
out and "forgot" where I parked my car and phoned in at around 1am and
reported it stolen only to find it about 30 metres down the road (true)
and I felt like a #$#$#@(*&.

Then I got picked up by the local boys and breatho-ed at 7am Sunday
morning (yes, I was on my way to work believe it or not) and I
explained, etc and needless to say I passed the test.  It is good though
that they look after us, even people like me who suffer amazing losses
of memory from time to time about these things.  (First time, really!)

Anyhow, with the weather improving here rapidly it has become a paradise
once more.  Tomorrow will be 35 degrees celsius and that's how it'll be
for another 8 months at least.

Has anyone had any embarrassing moments where they've forgotten where
they parked and it's has had an affect on them??
