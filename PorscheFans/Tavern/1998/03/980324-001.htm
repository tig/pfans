	I find it hard to send messages here without it having _some_
reference to Porsche :)  So I'll just ignore that rule for the time being.
I'm happy to report that I've finally found a girl who _likes_ my Porsche
(or at least thinks it "pretty neat").  She doesn't like driving fast, but
hey you can't win 'em all.  At least she seems to like me :)  My current
girlfriend may not be too crazy about this, but I feel I have the right to
exercise the option in our relationship to do whatever I want to do.  Of
course, she does provide the New Jersey home of my car - her garage spot
at her parents' house.  Hmm...dilemma :)
	BTW, I'm sorry to those of you who mailed about meeting in NYC for
drinks or at a restaurant.  I sort of got busy and wasn't able to pull it
all together.  I'm still interested in doing it however.  Maybe next week?
Like friday or so?
