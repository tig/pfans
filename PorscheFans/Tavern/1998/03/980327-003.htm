	I definitely agree with the car-first theory of relationships :)
I figure I'll pick up another car and then sometime after the year 2k,
I'll think about that wife thing that people seem to be doing.  _just_ in
case it goes sour, I want my Porsche to be _my_ Porsche.

	Paul -
	You're not a fan of working things out?  See I'm a freak - the
second I get into a relationship with someone, I begin by asking myself
"could I marry this person?"  The usual answer is "no".  But then I
figure, I really don't know who they are and maybe stuff will work out and
even if it doesn't, maybe we'll have a lot of fun anyway.  
	To further complicate things, next weekend I'm going to go see one
of my best friends with whom I used to go to college.  She basically lived
with me for years (irritating me to no end for that first year) and I've
finally decided that I can no longer take the sexual tension between us :)
Maybe it's not the greatest idea, but I think I'm building up to a point
that's beyond tolerance.
	
	Anyone else in the Boston-Washington corridor?  It's a GORGEOUS
day outside.  I'm grabbing my 911 and driving it for four hours to go to
Baltimore from NYC and I can't wait :)

-Vijay
