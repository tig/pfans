	I'm a bit too young to be thinking too seriously about marriage. 
I'm 21 so I figure I have at least a few years in me before anything
serious occurs.  In fact, I'd need at least a few years to realize that
this was the girl to marry!  I think I tend to have problems seeing the
obvious when it comes to women so I might take a while to realize that
this is the one to marry.  I don't really want to get involved with a
starter marriage or anything.  I want divorice to be what the other guys
do.  Of course, I'm sure everyone does and sometimes stuff just doesn't
work out.  This is coming from a guy whose current 6 month relationship is
the longest of his life!  My real concern is whether the two can be
balanced until one of them falls apart :)  Acutally I'm semi-worried that
the girl in the longer relationship simply doesn't care anymore.  But
oddly, she called me last night from Florida where she is on vacation. 
Didn't expect to hear from her until she got back.  I wonder if my car
will be homeless if things get really bad between us...or if it will just
be better for us both if I moved it.  Anyone have any suggestions for
parking garages in NYC?
