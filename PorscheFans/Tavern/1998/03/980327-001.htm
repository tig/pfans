Hey Vijay

Don't try to work things out - save that delight for a later date.  Wait
till you WANT to feel wise.

If you have to ask yourself "is this the one" then she isn't.

Also, wait at least another 5-6 years which means you'll enjoy the
experience another 10-12 times (@ 6 mths a time) and then you'll be most
probably be an expert on the subject!

The trick is to know what the other person is thinking and the effect of
that.  Without listing off a whole lot of tired old words, it's the
trick.

Old Jungle Saying: "The Marriage Should Last As Long As The Matrimonial
Bed Does" 
And it is a jungle out there.  You might go shopping together for a new
one when you wear the first one out.

However, that logic doesn't cover other precious aspects such as
children, who are probably the best thing in life.

And, yeah, I reckon your girlfriend should love your car.  It's only
normal because P cars are beautiful.

I'd be suspicious of someone who didn't like P cars.
