Just thought i would share a little story that happened this past weekend.

Vandalism should be eliminated, but do think twice if you do come across some
one vandalizing your precious vehicle.  This past weekend, I had a couple of
friends at a party in the woods, a young man saw another vandalizing his truck
and went to confront the vandals with pepper spray.  As the vandals were being
sprayed, one took out a knife and a pair of scissors and stabbed the young man
in the back 4 times.  A second young man by the name of Mark went to his
friends side to help and was stabbed 22 times, 3 of which hit the heart.  It
would be nice if people would respect others property, but in all in all, it
is just a object and don’t let it risk your life.  The young man that went to
his friends side (Mark) died that night and the other is still in the
hospital.

When will the madness STOP!!
