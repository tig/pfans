I have to say I am working my a... off these days (wish I was working my
stomach off!)

ME TOO. I'M STUCK IN NIGERIA DRIVING A CADD COMPUTER 12 TO 14 HOURS A DAY
FOR 5 WEEKS WITHOUT A BREAK.

I heard some good Irish jokes the other day

WELL TELL US THEM THEN!

Anyone feeling chatty?

ITS SO BORING HERE I'LL TALK TO ANYONE

My friend has gone to NZ to walk the Milford Sound and I'm REALLY BUSY
doing what I do so I'm back to batchelorhood momentarily and it has it's
good points too I suppose

I GOT DIVORCED IT'S BL**DY GREAT.

Is anyone else's health suffering due to overwork?

YEP

Does anyone else cook their own dinner because the restaurants aren't
just what you'd like?

I EAT OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT NOT OVER HERE.

Is anyone else in the same kind of predicament?

LOOKS LIKE IT.
