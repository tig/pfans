let me have the 911 but it isn't that big a deal one way or the other, =
my oldest
daughter loves it and would go everywhere in it if she could, and my =
youngest
daughter hates it and will only get in it under duress (bribes work =
also). But then the younger one just remembers pictures of my last =

parts hanging off after it was hit on the highway %^(

Hi Vijay,

Go for the she girl that likes your both you and your PORSCHE. Should =
you
ever get hitched to the other one. (Girls with a ring on thier finger
metaphorpise into totally diffent creatures. Things which were =
acceptable
when dating become totally unacceptable once hitched)  If she regards =
your
metal icon as anyway a rival. You will be in a world of hurt.
