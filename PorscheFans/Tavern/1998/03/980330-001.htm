Hi Paul and PFans,

You were asking about people mislaying their cars?

I was once a passenger in my mates car when we came across a car park were
we discovered my own car (pre P'car era for me) parked. My little brother
had borrowed it. I had a set of keys in my pocket so I moved said vehicle
and hid it.

My brother appeared a short while later eating a bag of Fish & Chips (Frie's
to those in the states). Walks to where the car had been parked. Doe's a
double take. Spins around a few times. Throws lunch on the floor. Puts both
hands on head in total horror then spots my mates car with two people
creasing themselve's with laughter in the front seat. He was not amused.

Stephen (stuck in Africa)
