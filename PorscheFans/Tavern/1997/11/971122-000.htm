I drove a rental car for a week in Nova Scotia and PEI three years ago,
and that was my first exposure to DRLs on a large scale.  You do indeed
forget to turn the lights on at night.  When I first read of them in the
NMA literature, my initial objection--and one that I've never read in
any of the standard arguments--was that, in the case of a failing
alternator, you won't be able to run as far on the battery.

True, if everybody had those things, no one would stand out--defeats the
purpose with visual overload.  Same as with the high-mounted brake
light. Hank Watts took his off, I remember. The first version of the
light on 911 cabs and Targas looked like E.T.

I just wonder when the do-gooders are going to realize that there's no
way to make driving risk-free.  

Regards,
Steve Gilbert
