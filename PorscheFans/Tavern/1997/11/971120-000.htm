From the National Motorists Association web site:

DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS ARE MORE THAN A NUISANCE

As Americans take to the road they will be 
subjected to an increase in visual clutter which the National Motorists 
Association (NMA) says is a dangerous trend. Auto manufacturers such as 
General Motors and Volkswagen are producing more vehicles with 
hard-wired daytime running lights (DRLs) as a safety measure. However, 
there has been virtually no consideration of the negative effects of 
this trend, including increased driver aggravation and irritation.

In response to numerous complaints from member and non-member drivers, 
the NMA has submitted a petition to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) to prohibit hard-wired daytime running lights in 
all new vehicles.

The NMA has identified the following negative results from increased DRL 
use:

REDUCTION IN EMERGENCY VEHICLE CONSPICUITY: Concentrations of DRLs 
reduce emergency vehicle conspicuity, as well as conspicuity of funeral 
processions and other convoys that are not moving in sync with normal 
traffic.

REDUCTION IN MOTORCYCLIST CONSPICUITY: Motorcyclists, who have long used 
their headlights during daytime hours to increase the conspicuity of 
their smaller vehicles, will no longer enjoy this added security 
benefit.

MASKING OF OTHER ROADWAY USERS: DRLs dominate visual attention to the 
exclusion and disadvantage of pedestrians, bicyclists, highway workers, 
and other vehicles that do not have DRLs.

DISTORTION OF DISTANCE PERCEPTION: Some individuals believe DRLs make 
other vehicles appear closer than they truly are, while other believe 
the opposite. What is certain is that DRLs distort distance perception.

MOTORIST FAILURE TO USE STANDARD LIGHTS: Because DRLs provide a degree 
of forward lighting, many motorists fail to use their standard lights in 
low-light, low-visibility situations. This means the rear lights of 
these vehicles are not illuminated, increasing the risk of rear-end 
collisions. Interestingly, the potential for daytime tail light use to 
mask brake lights has already been recognized. This is supported by the 
fact that certain DRL circuitry excludes activation of tail lights.

OBSCURED DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS: DRLs are also blamed for reducing or 
obscuring the visibility of directional signal lights.

INCREASED VISUAL GLARE: Headlight glare from both oncoming and following 
vehicles is the most common DRL complaint registered with the NMA 
office, with GM vehicles cited most frequently. Some of the unsafe 
tactics motorists are using to deal with this growing aggravation 
include the use of nighttime settings on rear view mirrors during 
daytime hours, maladjustment of outside mirrors, and the use of 
sunglasses during low-light and cloudy conditions.

Rather than simply increasing conspicuity, multiple vehicles with DRLs 
are found to be distracting, while adding an element of confusion to 
otherwise normal traffic flow. The promotion of DRLs and their 
appearance on vehicles in the U.S. can be attributed to certain 
manufacturers who are trying to harmonize their product lines in 
response to misguided public policies in non-U.S. markets.

The NMA believes the continued and expanded use of DRLs is a wasteful 
and counterproductive practice that should be discouraged through 
vehicle equipment standards and public education programs. We are not 
dismissing the value of daytime headlight use for very specific purposes 
and during periods of reduced visibility. However, we believe the 
proliferation of hard-wired DRLs will undermine these advantages.

NMA's petition to NHTSA asks the agency to prohibit hard-wired DRLs on 
all new vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States, while 
requiring auto makers to add an on/off switch on existing vehicles with 
DRLs. The petition also requests a prohibition on the use of high-beam 
headlights as a component of a DRL system, and includes a requirement 
that any DRL system currently using high-beam components be recalled and 
disconnected, or converted to low-beam components.

Drivers are already subjected to a growing and never-ending array of 
distractions that require ever-increasing levels of concentration. What 
drivers don't need is a new source of visual clutter, especially when 
it's caused by a so-called "safety" feature.
