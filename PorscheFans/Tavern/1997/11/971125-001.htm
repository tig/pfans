I agree with the posting of material other that Porsche related topics. If I
have no interest I just skip past it like I do with Porsche related topics.
And I was in agreement with D Kalma on the behavior of motorcycles and cars.
There is a place for agressive driving. I will be the first to admit that I
open up my 928 very often. But it will be on a dry stretch of road. No
passengers and stop at the first sign of any other motorist. You never know
how they will react so it is not your driving in question. I have seen
motorcyles zip in and out of cars and the reaction form people is to
immediatly steer away from the unexpected sights and sounds into another car.
But for the most part they are very good drivers. And thank you for spelling
offence the way I do. SAL
