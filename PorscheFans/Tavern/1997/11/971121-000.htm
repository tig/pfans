Scott:

The National Motorists Association ignored the biggest problem with 
DRL's:  They look stupid.

    [Canadians:  The following doesn't necessarily apply to you,
    since your government requires the damn things.]

While it's appropriate for funeral processions, schoolbus drivers,
motorcyclists, and mommies in minivans to drive in daylight with
their headlights on, DRLs make all other drivers look meek and
terrified... As though they're the sort of people who wouldn't
venture out into the world without wearing a bright safety-orange
nylon vest.

I turn on my headlights (or driving lights, depending on what car
I'm driving) when I'm driving on very twisty rural roads.  I also tap
the horn before exiting a narrow alley and crossing a sidewalk.

Unless it was stupidly mandated by U.S. law, however, I wouldn't be
caught dead driving on open roads in sunny weather with my headlights
on, just as I don't really feel the need to warn other motorists of
my presence by sounding the horn continuously from the moment I leave
my driveway until I reach my destination.

Just my opinion; I could be wrong.
