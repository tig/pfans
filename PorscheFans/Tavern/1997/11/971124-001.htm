Other than having to work through the spelling misteaks, I got your
drift. If you are one of the rare motorcyclists who wears proper
equipment and drives reasonably, my apologies and admiration for you as
a rare breed. I have no concern about people using the performance that
the vehicle is capable of WHERE IT IS PRUDENT TO DO SO. My offence with
motorcyclists is mainly around those who are weaving in and out of
traffic at high speed where conditions most certainly do not support
driving 50% over the average speed of traffic flow, or, worse yet, down
my 50 kmh street complete with kids playing etc etc.....

Once one is in a less crowded area, I will be the first one to cheer
them on......beautiful machines that they are.......
