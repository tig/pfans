Personally, I think the idea of making motorbikes less visual is yet
another really strong reason why they should be made mandatory.
Personally I am pretty sick of motorcyclists who insist on removing
mufflers (and disturbing my peace), driving like fools in traffic (as
they are so narrow and "can") and those who somehow think it is their
dumb right to drive without helmets, leathers or other reasonable safety
equipment and thus increase my taxes in higher hospital bills and child
support when they split their heads open on the pavement.

Hopefully, in a form of Darwinian selection, the motorcyclists will be
killed off quicker with the advent of DRL's (with any luck before they
have been able to reproduce) and thus the gene pool will be further
improved.

It's 'cycle season!!
