Probably your well written note (no sarcasm intended, I was impressed)
describes the basic difference in belief and likely why I would not want
to be a citizen of your country.

One question though, I agree that historically speaking the right to
bear arms has had great validity when essentially the fighting equipment
of the citizenry was basically equivalent to that of the any potentially
threatening government (ie back in 1770 and probably up to recent
years). Hence at that time a group of well organised citizens could do
battle and successfully resist a threatening government as was done in
your revolution (shall we ignore the contribution of the French for a
while). Do you think that in this day in age when the weaponry available
to the government by virtue of its armoury (ie tanks, planes etc etc) is
vastly superior to anything the citizenry could even begin to muster,
that the right to bear arms as a means of deterring a bad government is
valid? Admitting guerrilla warfare has its place in terms of annoying
and encouraging an external occupier to depart the premises (as the Viet
Cong and Afgani's did in recent years) but is not likely to dislodge a
government who's residence is in same country as the guerrilla's.....I
think that the right to bear arms idea is seriously out of date.
My concern is more that the American public faces a violent crime rate
that is higher than any other place in the world (at least in G7 type
nations) and I do not believe that there is a greater population of nut
cases in the US....just it is too easy for them to kill someone by
virtue of the easy access to weaponry.

BTW, I have the book Starship Troopers (I assume you mean the Heinlein
one) and I guess I can really appreciate the point of view.....I just
don't agree, but I love debating it!!
