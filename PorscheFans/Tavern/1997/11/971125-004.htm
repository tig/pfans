Interesting point of view, quite characteristic of most folks I have met
from the US. Another point of view is that society, via the government,
is in place to put reasonable safeguards in place to protect us from
other's poor judgement, hence my comment on annoyance at having to pay
for the medical costs of motorcyclists who don't wear a helmet and thus
incur more severe injuries as a result. Basic view, one which I hold
dear regardless of the view of Mr. Henry, is that I am willing to
sacrifice a degree of my personal freedom in the interests of the common
good, and willing to trust that there is strength in democracy
sufficiently strong to ensure no severe abuses of governmental power
occur. If I think they have gone too far, I vote for the opposition and
if enough of my neighbours agree, then they are out and laws get
changed. In the mean time, I am willing to take the odd annoyance as a
personal price to pay for the common good.

In the case of DRL's, it is arguable, but the penalty/cost  is very low,
I would rather get rid of air bags (high cost, again arguable benefit)
and have strict laws on seat belt usage..........especially as I have a
4' 11" wife and need to disable the airbags so as to prevent her
decapitation in the event of accident....

Now if you really want to argue a contentious point, how about the
absurd right to bear arms in the US?? (Sorry....I have had many an
argument with my American colleagues, and I STILL can't resist the
temptation to poke at what I consider an absolutely insane point of
view)
