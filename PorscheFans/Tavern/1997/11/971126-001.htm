The government should only have three functions: provide national defense, 
affairs of state, and interstate commerce.  In your opinion, Dennis, the 
government protects us from poor judgement by legislating safety devices.  In 
my opinion, since vehicles play such a large roll in interstate commerce, I 
could almost allow the government to intervene -- but only to legislate 
education and training.  I think it is unfortunate that in the US driving is 
viewed as a right without any responsibilities.  Perhaps therein lies the rub.

I can't argue.  Absolutely insane.  My coworker's son was shot last week and 
has just left Johns Hopkins shock trauma unit.  The son is paralyzed from the 
bellybutton down.  I'd like to melt every gun and use the metal for more 
productive uses -- like making Porsches.
