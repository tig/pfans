Im sorry if this offended you, however this is the Tavern were things other
than just porsche stuff can be posted.  There are lots of diferent types of
humor out there as there is lots of diferent types of people and cars in this
world.   But just because you may or may not like a cirtain color of skin or
dislike a persons car for the make of it, It does not make you a better man
to tell me what i can or what i cant post on this forum.  So if ya dont like
it, dont read it!

As to the motorcycle issue.

In Washington state, helmets are a requirment and if the person dosnt have
the brains to use one, he probly didnt need it anyway.  You talk about how
motorcycles always drive recklessly.  Can you honestly tell me that you have
never opened up your porsche??  Untill you are perfect, dont critisize me,
for you dont have any idea how i may ride my street bike.
