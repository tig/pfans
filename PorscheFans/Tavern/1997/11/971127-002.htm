One question though, I agree that historically speaking the right to
bear arms has had great validity when essentially the fighting equipment
of the citizenry was basically equivalent to that of the any potentially
threatening government (ie back in 1770 and probably up to recent
years). Hence at that time a group of well organised citizens could do
battle and successfully resist a threatening government as was done in
your revolution ...

It is very true that the military of the US is vastly superior and
vastly better equipped than any private citizen can be.  In times of
war, however, you need to look at tactics, moral, supply, motivation as
well as numerical and tactical superiority.   For example, a
sufficiently motivated volunteer force would have access to modern
military-grade weaponry through theft, desertion and raiding parties as
well as foreign supply.  Presumably a smash and grab resistance would
have great, nearly impossible, odds against them in winning a war where
the government was popular and the military was loyal.  In this type of
case the rebels would be likely supported by a small base of loyalists
and would eventually be defeated.  If however, the military moral was
poor due to corruption, budget cuts and a conflicting set of values
(being asked to fire on their own civilian population), the
citizen-owned weapons would only have to suffice until a proper supply
of up-to-date weaponry was established, as happened in our American
Revolution.  No one expects to beat a government by private ownership of
38 Special revolvers.  The private ownership only buys time, harrassment
of enemy forces and the lowering of moral in enemy forces.  If every
high-rise holds a sniper, every wooded patch of land along the
interstates a few AK47s, every gas station a supplier of Molotov
Cocktails then the situation is less clear as to the final winner.  As I
recall, the rabble of France were able to defeat Louis XV1 (?) because
his own soldiers turned against him.  The Czar Nicholas was defeated by
returning and hungry and embittered soldiers. The Germans in Russia were
fought by peasants and the army.  China was not turned to democracy
because the students in the Square did not have the military on their
side, and had no weapons of their own.

PS:  I do NOT envision fighting a war against my government, I just like
to play war games in my head.
