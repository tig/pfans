What is all this talk about owning bear arms? What about the helpless
bears? What are they going to do without their arms?

What? The right to bear arms? Oh, well that's different. Never mind!

Ms. Emily Litella

BTW, I do believe the whole issue over owning weapons in the US was
primarily due to the pioneer's expansionism in the New World. In order
to keep moving west the settlers needed weapons to kill the original
inhabatants when they became unhappy over their new neighbors. The
British provided protection in the larger communities via their own
troops and militia, but they were understandably reluctant to give their
colonists the tools to overthrow the yokes of tyranny. So it was a
natural to include it in the original Bill of Rights...
