    Of course you wouldn't, Dennis... As a Canadian citizen, you
    enjoy the protection of the United States against foreign
    aggression (be it military or economic), but you neither have to
    pay for that protection nor deal with the difficult problems
    associated with ensuring it.

    Hell, _I_ wouldn't mind being a Canadian citizen, except that I
    don't think I could handle the weather, the multicolored money,
    the way you people speak, or the high price of cigarettes.

    You're right; the argument for private gun-ownership as a means
    of discouraging government tyranny is a little out-of-date... But
    we NEED guns, so we can shoot out daytime running lights.
