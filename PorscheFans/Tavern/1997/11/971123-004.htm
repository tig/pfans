Interesting topic for you all to raise, and interesting to see the
responses. As a rash generalisation, it is no wonder Americans are still
too silly to wear seatbelts and hence have forced those stupid airbags
on the rest of us.
DRLs have been testing in many countries around the world, and have been
adopted in legislation in countries that have particularly harsh weather
conditions. There is no doubt that it is easier to see a car with its
headlights turned on, and that does not matter weather on a long stretch
of highway in the desert (where heat haze can totally obscure on-coming
traffic) or on twisty roads during a storm. 
The basic fact is that most people driving cars have the hazard
perceptions abilities of a rabbit caught by a spotlight.
I don't know about you guys, but I don't trust those other cars on the
road, and I want to maximise my chances of surviving. Only problem that
I see with DRLs is that it is really not that useful in the city on a
fine day - but perhaps that is a worthwile sacrifice if the basic
population is too stupid to turn the lights on when they need them.
