Dennis Kalma,  Scotty and  Kincaid all have excellent points.  So is the
problem with the gun, the government that regulates the gun or the user o=
f
the gun.  Then could there be a possibility for change in gun policy due =
to
the area that you may live in?  I my self live in a very separated area o=
f
the country were the west side of our state wants to do away with guns an=
d
east wants to keep every gun available to every man, woman and child.  On=
 the
west side of Washington,(for the most part) the areas are in a way very
segregated.  There are bad areas that have a very high crime rate and the=
re
good areas with almost no crime rate.  Most of the people in charge of ma=
king
laws and enforcing them on the west side I assume live in a reasonably go=
od
area with a limited or no crime.  These people want to and put up a ballo=
t
this yr to put a mandatory gun lock on every gun and only the licensed ow=
ner
could operate the weapon.  For example, if you owned the weapon and your
spouse needed the weapon for self defense, he or she could be tried for
breaking the law and could face prison time.  On the east side of the
mountains, the bad sides and the good sides of town for the most part hav=
e
merged.  We have a very serious problem with youths with guns and a crime
rate per capita that is higher than even a metro area like Seattle.  Murd=
er
in this town unfortunately is not a uncommon thing for a town of 50 thous=
and.
 Living in Seattle and depending on the area I lived in, I would be quite
content with out a weapon.  But living in this city, its not a bad thing =
to
have.  You wouldn=92t go to Bagdad <(might be misspelled) with out a load=
ed
weapon would you?  I don't love guns, but I have one.  I don't love
Motorcycle Helmets, but I use one, and I don't like speed limits, but whe=
n
there is people around, I obey them.

:To John_b5@hotmail.com
It wasn=92t matter of racism, I was just creating a analogy.  Sorry for t=
he
misunderstanding.=20

:To Len and written by Len
>That extremely derogatory excerpt you called a poem was in very poor tas=
te,

>The fact that you find that kind of thing humorous actually gives pretty

Dear Len     I want to know who made you the god of what poor taste is.  =
And
for that matter, who gives you the right to judge if a person is respecta=
ble
or not.  By the way, you and the other 4 people that complained are only =
5
out of who knows how many members of the tavern. And if there was let say
only a 100 people that belonged to the list, even a number so small, that
still only makes you  5% of the voice.

:To Rich
Thank you for pointing out that my spelling needs work.  Constructive
criticism is never a bad thing.  Yet insulting a persons opinions, I don=92=
t
agree with.  And I am not blaming you for doing so.

::To everyone else that did or didn=92t like the poem that I send about a=
 week
ago.  The purpose of the poem was to make people laugh. Not to piss a bun=
ch
of people off as it did.  Every one else I sent the poem to loved it.  Th=
e
problem with this world is that most people don=92t ever compliment if th=
ey
like something.  But if they don=92t like something, then the letters sta=
rt
pouring in, like in this instance.  Once again, I will apologize for
offending the people that I might have offended. But its people like you =
that
complain when the coffee is too hot at Mc Donalds. And seem to think that
because you might have a higher education or that you have a white collar=
 job
that lets you afford the finer things in life.  You think you know what=92=
s
suitable for others to read, see, and hear. And to those who believe that=
,
and like my self, we are ALL entitled to our opinions.  My only suggestio=
n to
our group here is that if my self or someone else didn=92t like what was
published, do one of two things.  1) Keep your mouth shut.  Or  2) Simply
state that  ::I didn=92t like the joke.   That way, the opinion is stated=
 and
no ones feelings are hurt or opinion is insulted.   And now that I have
apologized once again, can we move on to a new subject.  This is getting
boring and like Larry Flynt, I don=92t keep quiet easy.       SORRY TO AL=
L.=20
