Now if you really want to argue a contentious point, how about the
absurd right to bear arms in the US?? (Sorry....I have had many an
argument with my American colleagues, and I STILL can't resist the
temptation to poke at what I consider an absolutely insane point of
view)

Dennis

Sorry to quote you Dennis, but our past history would have been very
different without the private ownership of firearms.  If the Militia under
orders of the Continental Congress had not had their own private weapons
the British troops would have certainly been able to hold the cities, and
better weapons and uniforms and mercenaries would never have arrived from
France and Germany.  Our future would have been extremely different, and
without continued ownership of private weapons our future may be very
different.  It has always been the ability of the people to fight back
against tyranny that has allowed Western Civilization to progress while
other cultures have stagnated and/or been forced to exist under kings,
emperors, dictators.  Some day it may become necessary to provide impetus
by force a change in the Federal Government;  I hope not, but without the
application of outside force entropy always increases in a system.

We exercise a small revolt against what we perceive to be an unjust or
unfair law even by owning a sports car that may exceed the legal posted
limits of highway speed by many times.  When we actually speed we break
those laws willingly, a blatant act of revolt. 

The "Common Good" is an extremely relative point of view, depending on
political, religious and personal viewpoints.  By the ideals of many, the
common good means closing the borders, expelling everyone who is not white
and having the One, True Religion taught everywhere.  By the government's
view, the common good means keeping the Union together, sacrificing the
few for the many and keeping their jobs.  My view of the common good is
that people should be first responsible to themselves and their families
first (God is in there also), then to their friends and neighbors then
to the State.  The ability to question the State and be willing to
sacrifice to make certain that the State does indeed in most cases support
a real common good dictates that weapons ownership remain in the hands of
the many.

Personally, I think that motorcycle riders, drug users, car owners,
weapons-holders should be able to do anything they wish as long as no one
is physically injured outside themselves.  Any country that can afford to
bail out half the far east, support military operations in half the world,
build innumerable prisons to house a third of one of its racial groups for
specious drug use instead of rehabilitating them and training them to be
useful members of society has no business telling me that I have to wear a
helmet on a motorbike.

Read a story called, "The Weapons Shops of Isher", sometime.  Read (the
original) book, "Starship Troopers".  Read!
