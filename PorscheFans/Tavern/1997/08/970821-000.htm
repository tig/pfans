I drive the hell out of my car when it is running which it has not for the
past 6 weks because it wont start. This is the first non Ford car I have ever
own. It is a 1980 gray market 928. Very very beautiful car. Black with black
leather in fantastic shape. It is an automatic though. Just spent more money
than I can afford to get the air conditioning working. It seems the guy who
had before me screwed me there. So the mechanic is coming by my home to see
why it wont start this time. It fires up but just wont start. I know that it
is a fuel problem, the damn gas just wont stay up in the motor for that first
spark. So drive your car more than once a month. I just wash mine everyday.
