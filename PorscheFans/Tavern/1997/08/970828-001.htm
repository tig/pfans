A true story.  A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam
for his graduate students.  It had one question: Is hell exothermic or
endothermic?  Support your answer with a proof.

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or
some variant.  One student, however wrote the following:


First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass.
If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass.  So, at what rate
are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving?  I think
that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will
not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.


As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different
religions that exist in the world today. Some of these
religions state that if you are not a member of their
religion, you will go to hell.  Since there are more than
one of these religions and people do not belong to more
than one religion, we can project that all people and all
souls go to hell.


With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls
in hell to increase exponentially.


Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states
that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same,
the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant.


#1 So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls
enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until
all hell breaks loose, meaning that hell is exothermic.


#2 Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of
souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell
freezes over, meaning that hell is endothermic.


So which is it? If we accept the postulate given me by Therese Banyan
during Freshman year, and take into account the fact that I still have
not
succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then #2 cannot be true.
Therefore, hell is exothermic.


This student got the only A.
