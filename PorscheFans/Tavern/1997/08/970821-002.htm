Well, John, I'm on the other end of the idiot scale.  I drive my car as often 
as possible.  I drive it every day to a where I work, which is a coal fired 
power station.  I live less than a mile from the Atlantic Ocean.  Hell, I've 
even drag raced the thing.  And I don't even have a garage -- let alone keep 
the car in it.  But when I think of the fun I've had in that car over the last 
11 years... I have to go now... I'm getting teary eyed.
