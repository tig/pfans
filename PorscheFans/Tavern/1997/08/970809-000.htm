>> If anyone likes cookies, otherwise sorry for the Junk Mail.
>> From a woman named Susan@premier-travel.com
>> This is a true story... Please forward it to everyone that you can...
>> You will have to read it to believe it...
>> 
>> My daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in
>> Dallas
>> & decided to have a small dessert.  Because both of us are such cookie
>> lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie".  It was so
>> excellent
>> that I asked if they would give me the recipe and the waitress said
>> with a small frown "I'm afraid not."
>> 
>> "Well" I said, "would you let me buy the recipe?"  With a cute smile,
>> she said YES". 
>> 
>> I asked how much and she responded, "Only two fifty, it's a great
>> deal!" I said with  approval, "just add it to my tab".
>> 
>> Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and
>> it was$285.00.  I looked again and remembered I had only spent $9.95
>> for two
>> salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom of
>> the
>> statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00".  That's outrageous!!! I
>> called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them that the waitress said
>> it was  "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "two hundred and
>> fifty
>> dollars" by any POSSIBLE interpretation of the phrase. Neiman-Marcus
>> refused to  budge.
>> 
>> They would not refund my money, because according to them, "What the
>> waitress told you is not our problem.  You have already seen the
>> recipe -we absolutely will not refund your money at this point."  I
>> explained
>> to her the criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas.  I
>> threatened
>> to refer them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney
>> General
>> for engaging in fraud.  I was basically told, "Do what you want, we
>> don't
>> give a damn, and we're not refunding your money."
>> 
>> I waited a moment, thinking of how I could get even, or even try to
>> get any of my money  back.  I just said, "Okay, you folks got my
>> $250.00,
>> and now I'm going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was
>> going to see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with
>> an
>> e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for
>> free.
>> She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this" I said,  "Well you should
>> have
>> thought of that before you ripped me off", and slammed down the phone
>> on her.
>>  
>> So, here it is!!!
>> Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can
>> possibly think of.  I paid $250.00 dollars for this...  I don't want
>> Neiman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this recipe... (Recipe
>> may be halved):
>> 
>>   2     cups butter
>>   4     cups flour
>>   2     tsp. baking soda
>>   2     cups granulated sugar
>>   2     cups brown sugar

>>   1     tsp. salt

>>   4     eggs

>>   3     cups chopped nuts (your choice)
>>   2     tsp. vanilla
>> 
>> Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together
>> with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add chocolate
>> chips,
>> Hershey bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a
>> cookie sheet.
>>

>> Have Fun!!!  This is not a joke - this is a true story...  Ride free
>> citizens!!!!
>> 
>> This isn't some stupid chain letter either.. pass it on.. if you
>> don't,
>> you won't die or get dumped.. you'll just do the world an in service
>> Have a nice day
