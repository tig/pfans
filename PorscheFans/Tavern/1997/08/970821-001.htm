Yah, I'll admit I like the effect it has on the fairer sex.  Problem is, it
the ones it affects are generally the ones I can't stand.  Hmmmm...what
does that say about me?  Either I'm just stupid or there's hope for me yet
;0)

I drive mine every single day, rain or shine, and wash it obsessively.  So
it does stay relatively clean, but I can't stop the occasional chip 'n
ding.  My thinking is that I bought it to drive and that's how I enjoy it.
Other people enjoy them in other ways -- it's what makes the world go
round!  :)

Incidentally, are people in Hondas invincible, or do they just think they
are?  Some moron in front of me in an Accord decided that she wanted to
turn the other direction and started backing up.  Since there was somebody
behind me all I could do was lean on the horn and pray.  Thankfully she
stopped about 1/2 inch from my H4.  This is the SECOND time this has
happened!  Maybe it's the Inviso-paint and stealth-mode radar warning
system...
