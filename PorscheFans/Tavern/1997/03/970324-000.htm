True story.  (Police Records & Los Angeles Times)
DARWIN AWARDS, which people get for doing something incredibly stupid.
*******************************************************************

Here's the winner: Larry Walters is among the relatively few who have = 
actually turned their dreams into reality.
His story is true, as hard as you may find it to believe.
Larry was a truck driver, but his lifelong dream was to fly. When he = 
graduated from high school, he joined the Air Force in hopes of becoming = 
a pilot.
Unfortunately, poor eyesight disqualified him. So when he finally left = 
the service, he had to satisfy himself with watching others fly the = 
fighter jets that crisscrossed the skies over his backyard.
As he sat there in his lawn chair, he dreamed about the magic of flying. = 
Then one day, Larry had an idea. He went down to the local Army-Navy = 
surplus store and bought forty-five weather balloons, and several tanks = 
of helium. These were not your brightly colored party balloons, these = 
were heavy-duty spheres measuring more than four feet across when fully = 
inflated. Back in his yard, Larry used straps to attach the balloons to = 
his lawn chair, the kind you might have in your backyard. He anchored = 
the chair to the bumper of his jeep, and inflated the balloons with = 
helium. Then he packed a few sandwiches and drinks, and a loaded BB gun, = 
figuring he could pop a few balloons when it was time to return to = 
earth.
His preparations complete, Larry sat in his chair and cut the anchoring = 
cord.
His plan was to lazily float into the sky, and eventually back to terra = 
firma.
But things didn't quite work out that way. When Larry cut the cord, he = 
didn't float lazily up; he shot up as if fired from a cannon! Nor did he = 
go up a couple hundred feet. He climbed and climbed until he finally = 
leveled off at eleven thousand feet! At that height, he could hardly = 
risk deflating any of the balloons, lest he unbalance the load and = 
really experience flying. So he stayed up there, sailing around for = 
fourteen hours, totally at a loss about how to get down.
Eventually, Larry drifted into the approach corridor for Los Angeles = 
International Airport. A Pan Am pilot radioed the tower about passing a = 
guy in a lawn chair at eleven thousand feet, with a gun in his lap . . . = 
now there's a conversation I would have given anything to have heard! = 
LAX is right on the ocean, and you may know that at nightfall, the winds = 
on the coast begin to change. So, as dusk fell, Larry began drifting out = 
to sea. At that point, the Navy dispatched a helicopter to rescue him, = 
but the rescue team had a hard time getting to him because the draft = 
from their propeller kept pushing his home-made contraption farther and = 
farther away. Eventually, they were able to hover above him and drop a = 
rescue line, with which they gradually hauled him back to safety.
As soon as Larry hit the ground, he was arrested. But as he was led away = 
in handcuffs, a television reported called out, "Sir, why'd you do it?" = 
Larry stopped, eyed the man, then replied nonchalantly, "A man can't = 
just sit around!"
