Bob H:

I think Andy's suggestion to try to keep this dialogue on comparisons to the
Tavern Digest is a good one and I've cross-posted this response to that list
as well as the Boxster list (hope I don't enter the "Devils Loop" with this
message!)  So forgive me this response to the 911 list primarily.  Perhaps if
this continues we can keep this on the Tavern List.

As noted, a comparison dialogue of this kind will never reach a logical (or
even rational) conclusion since the purchase of a Porsche is primarily (thank
God!) a personal emotional decision.  Further, we know nothing about your
preferences and driving habits or even experience with automobiles.  Some of
your posting comes across as rather flippant ("...debate to convince me to
come over to their camp....").  Your signature trailer as an owner of a
"Supercharged 318ti" (were you one of the folks who used to stick the
M-badges on theirs when I had a M3 and contributed to the never-ending
dialogue on the BMW list on how close and better value the "318/325" was than
an M3?).  Further, your comments indicate you need to do much more "personal
homework" on Porsches to be prepared to receive the "biased" comments we are
likely to give you.  If I'm wrong on this observation, please accept my
apology in advance!

Having owned Porsches, including every series except the 928, for the past 35
years, I'll offer the following for your consideration (as always with the
disclaimer it's only my opinion, whether "fact", "informed", or emotionally
"biased"):

1. Porsche traditionally always introduces a series of evolutionary changes
(both significant and modest design improvements) with each new model of a
series (356, 911, 944, etc) while sometimes adding "new problems" unique to
the new model line itself ("fix 3 add 2").  
In spite of our admiration for the marque, there are some traits of "Teutonic
Mentality" that continue "poor design features" (chain tensioners, head
studs, airbox design, etc) well beyond what should be tolerated as a standard
of "engineering excellence" with often stubborn refusal to incorporate
relatively "bulletproof" corrections until relatively late in the life of a
model series.

The latest cars in an engine related series are usually always the best
(81-83 911SC vs 74-77 911 2.7, 74 914/2 vs 71 914 1.7, 87-89 911 (Excluding
C4) vs 84-86 911, 85 1/2 944 vs 83/84 944 etc).  The differences range from
significant to minor, again based on your driving and usage preference.  In
stating this I recognize using the oxymoron disclaimer term "usually always"
recognizes the exceptions for suggested preference for 74 914/2's over 75-76
914/2's for example. 

With that, the current 96/97 (and the few widebodied C2S cars built as the
last 98 models) cars will be the "best" of the aircooled 911s.  The 986
Boxster, and the 996 (new evolution water cooled) 911 will have some "unique"
problems early in their series production.  What they will be and how long
they will persist no one to date knows for sure, but you can get an example
of some of these problems from owners initial reports on the Boxster list
(coolant levels dropping, diagnostic readouts, top retraction and fit, dealer
technician knowledge, etc.).  Some will be corrected early (with recalls) and
some will stubbornly persist as a Porsche "Feature" for years.  Over time
(again how long is anyones guess) the *new 911* will be a better automobile
in every respect than the current air-cooled series.

2. Early introduction cars of a "evolutionary" or "different" series will
depreciate more and not hold their value like the last cars of a prior
generation.  Compare the prices of well-maintained or original 356B/356C's to
early generation 911s.  The 1961-1965 356s bring a 40-50 percent higher price
(even higher for cabriolets) on the current market than most (exclude 72 S
and 73 RS) 911s of the 1966-1977 vintage.  (I would have been glad to trade
my then new 911 71T for a comparable 356SC based on happier memories of
ownership of a 62 Super 90).  You can also compare 76-77 924s (less the
cosmetic "Martini" model) to earlier 914s, for example.  As a "sidebar", I
was able to sell every Porsche  I bought new from 1962 to 1975 (including
some as much as 13 years old) for more than I paid for it when new.  Those
factors (dollar/mark changes, price escalations, etc.) which gave older cars
their retained price value no longer hold today.

3. With each evolutionary generation of cars (like the Boxster and the
forthcoming 996), be prepared for years of comments that "It's not a real
Porsche".  I heard many "derogatory" comments when the "new" 6 cylinder 911
was shown sitting next to the nearly last of the 356s at the Frankfurt Auto
Show in 1963.  The "grumbling" continued over the 914s life with the
protagonists sniffing that is was properly a "VW-Porsche" as marked and
marketed in Europe rather than a "true" Porsche (without recognizing that the
914 had a much lineage or heritage as the original 356s from the ubiquitous
"Beetle").  I found the 914 a delightful car, with a much different character
than a 911 and a delightful "driver's education" track car to drive nearer
it's limits than most of us "911 Street" drivers are capable of on a given
day.

The bottom line is than it is your preference and no one can argue with your
accepted rationale in purchase.  I noticed you also have a Miata.  We had a
90 model for over 6 years and found it to be a great little car (accepting
it's limitations for what it is, ...Sorry Pete!).  It was everything we hoped
an "evolutionary" 1990s 356 could have become (Sorry, everyone on the 356
list!).  We also had a Boxster on order, but after seeing them in the flesh,
driving one, (having also driven the BMW Z3), looking at the MB SLK, my own
emotional rationale was that "while a great open top tourer, they just
weren't that much *better* (careful, I'm giving away my preferences) that a
Miata at about half  percent the price of a Boxster". 

At least in my own mind, your requested comparison is "Apples and
Oranges"....the Boxster is a very different car than a 911...each with design
characteristics that for many of us define "greatness" (in the case of the
Boxster yet to be "earned") in a Sports Car.

As for us, remembering my regret when I was unable to buy the last of the
356C series in 1965, we dropped the Boxster deposit and happily (but with
holes in our pockets searching for every penny ) drove away in a 1997 C2
Coupe.

Without Regret....

Perry
