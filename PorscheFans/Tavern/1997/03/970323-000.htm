Hi P-Nuts,
FYI, there is a bill currently moving through the California legislature
(Senate Bill 470, sponsored by Senator Dick Rainey). This bill would
authorize traffic law enforcement by County Sheriffs. The purported
rationale is that "the Highway Patrol doesn't have enough Officers to
enforce the traffic laws". However, the real reason is financial. As
county funding sources are drying up, your friendly sheriff is looking
around for ways to make some money. 

If this bill becomes law, imagine trying to drive your shiney P-car in a
State where there are 58 counties with traffic law enforcement
authority, and 58 different interpretations of the Vehicle Code. I'm
sure that a bright red Porsche would be an attractive target. "You ain't
from around here, are you boy?"

I'm contacting my own elected representatives to persuade them that we
already have enough traffic cops, thank you very much, and that they
should vote against SB470.
