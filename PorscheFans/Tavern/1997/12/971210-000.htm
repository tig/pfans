I admit to doing some distracting things while driving (though never the
Porsche), but I too am dismayed by its prevalence.  I saw some lady in a
Jaguar sedan eating salad out of a Tupperware.  Not only gross, but
grossly PC.  The rule with my kids--no eating or drinking in the car. 
One time on the way home from somewhere in the Porsche I was starving,
stopped at a Taco Bell drive-through, and broke my own rule.  I learned
its wisdom when I started eating the burrito--from the wrong end.

That's why I say, when Porsche made cars without cupholders, they knew
what they were doing.  Like when you tell a tailor to put cuffs on your
tuxedo pants and he conveniently forgets--it means he's telling you
something:).

Regarding Mr Spalding

If she reads when driving, you would think that she might read the newspapers
too.  Last week, USA Today had a collum on driving schools.  I cant remember
for sure, but i think it said something about loosing 80 percent of your
consentration if doing something else while driving.  Even such things as
eating a cheeseburger, though i am guilty as charged for doing that.
