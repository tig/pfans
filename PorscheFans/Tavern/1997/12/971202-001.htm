If you live in a part of the world where you feel you have to carry
protection in the form of a handgun or rifle then I suggest you move to
a safer place.  Most parts of Australia are fine.

In Australia it's illegal to carry without a license and to get a
license is not so easy.

I'd hate to "carry" - I get hassled by my mobile phone, wallet, chunk of
keys not to mention the shopping bags, mail, things brought home from
work, etc - to add a loaded handgun to that would really ruin my day. 
If I had to use it I'd have to drop 2 handfuls of passive stuff, take
hold of the gun, take the safety off, point it, decide if I want to go
through 2-4 years of court cases before I pull the trigger, get a guilt
complex for having aimed and shot at someone and so on.

Not my speed at all.

But, if I was on a shooting range for sport and practice then different
story.  I know people really enjoy getting that bit of lead onto that
dot way off in the distance.  I enjoyed it when I got the Marksman's
Award when I was in school Army Cadets (back in time) for firing 303's. 
They can really hurt your shoulder unless you pull the butt in real
tight.  Especially when you're only a kid.
