Growing up in Detroit & hearing that bullsh*t all the time, I thought the
poem was pretty funny, (sad on how accurate it sounded), & passed it along
to some friends.  My thoughts are if you don't like it, after you read it
hit the delete button & forget about it.

How can you be mad at the poem?  They're teaching Ebonics in some schools!
As far as I'm concerned, it's their turn in the bag.  Just like men jokes,
women jokes, blonde jokes, etc.

Here's one to add to it:

No doubt some Bible societies will feel compelled to publish a new
translation of the Holy Scriptures in the newly discovered language of
Ebonics.

Here is a head start for them:
    
    EBONICS                              ENGLISH
   
Big Daddy's Rap                     The Lord's Prayer
     
Yo, Big Daddy upstairs              Our Father, who art in heaven
     
You be chillin'                     Hallowed be thy name
     
So be yo hood                       Thy kingdom come
     
You be sayin it, I be doin it       Thy will be done
     
In this here hood and yos           On Earth as it is in Heaven
     
Gimme some eats                     Give us this day our daily bread
     
And cut me some slack, Blood        And forgive us our trespasses
     
Sos I be doin it to dem dat		  As we forgive those who trespass
dis me					  against us
     
Don't be pushin me into no jive     And lead us not into temptation
     
And keep dem Crips away             But deliver us from evil
     
Cuz you always be da man            For Thine is the Kingdom,
                                    the Power and the glory
					  forever and ever
     
Aaa-men                             Amen
