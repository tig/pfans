$2 million?  Not my 928!  It's priceless!



ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.. (AP) New Mexico basketball player Kenny Thomas' 
skills are worth millions. 

That determination comes from Lloyd's of London, which insured him for 
$2 million in case he gets injured, the Albuquerque Journal reported 
today. 

"In car terms, he's worth about as much as a Porsche is worth," said 
Thomas' father, Calvin Thomas. "That's why I got that disability policy. 
They have him projected that he's worth $2 million." 

The Thomas family took out the policy with Lloyd's of London before this 
season in the event Thomas, a junior center, sustained a serious injury 
that keep him from playing in the NBA. 

Calvin Thomas said if something happens to his son, the policy could be 
worth as much as $4 million. To cover the policy, Calvin Thomas said his 
son will have to "pay $17,000 once he gets drafted."
