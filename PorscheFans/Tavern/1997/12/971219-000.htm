Daimler's Delay of Smart Car Seen as Sign of Times

Reuters
19-DEC-97
By Neil Winton 
LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Basic design flaws in automobiles were once 
discovered by consumers only after the vehicle they were driving spun 
out of control or blew up. 

But the recent decision by Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes to delay the 
launch of its innovative little Smart car only a month after it withdrew 
its recently relaunched and slightly bigger ``A'' class car from the 
market proves that the days of consumer road tests are gone, experts 
said. 

The growing threat of crippling law suits means car manufacturers cannot 
afford to cut corners. 

At the same time, the highly competitive nature of car markets adds to 
the temptation to do just that. 

Experts also said Mercedes' designers might have been under particular 
pressure because they were developing completely new cars. Car design is 
normally evolutionary, not revolutionary, they said. 

``Under the old system, car makers really used customers to develop 
their products. Cars would produce an assortment of dire defects which 
were actually found by people having accidents or breakdowns,'' said 
Karel Williams, a professor at Manchester University. 

On Thursday, Germany's Mercedes and its partner from Switzerland Sti 
Suisse Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie SA said they were delaying the 
launch of the tiny, two-seater town car until October 1998. 

Mercedes owns 81 per cent of the venture, SMH the rest. The Smart had 
failed the dreaded ``elk'' test, which was designed to show how cars 
handle sharp, fast, evasive turns. 

Mercedes is still suffering fall-out from its ``A'' class withdrawal. 
The ``A'' flipped over during the elk test, so named because 
Scandinavian car evaluators adopted it to see how cars reacted when 
required suddenly to avoid wandering animals. 

Mercedes' two withdrawals were prompted by the results of tests. 

``The Corvair had exactly the same problem. It didn't handle properly,'' 
Williams said. 

General Motors Corp's sold 1.5 million Chevrolet Corvairs before a 
devastating book -- ``Unsafe at any speed'' -- stopped it in its tracks. 
The book's author, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, pointed out that the 
rear-engined car could be lethal under vigorous cornering. 

At certain speeds the rear-suspension would collapse, causing loss of 
control, or a flip-over. 

GM only sold another 125,000 Corvairs, and it was withdrawn in 1969. 

Ford Motor Co introduced the Pinto in 1970, but a major flaw emerged 
later. Even the smallest shunt into its rear-end could cause the fuel 
tank to explode. Law suits abounded. 

The advent of consumerism, led by the likes of Nader, means that the 
costs of such failure now would be unacceptably high. 

``The background has changed now. If there was a law suit and an 
internal (corporation) memo showed they knew of the problem, the amount 
of damages can only be wondered at, especially if it was in the 
States,'' said Professor Garel Rhys at Cardiff Business School. 

``Manufacturers, especially makers of potentially lethal things like 
cars, have to be very careful indeed to show that they have designed 
everything right,'' Rhys said. 

``In a world where everyone is prepared to sue, you've got to get it 
right,'' said Rhys. 

Rhys said Mercedes' move into small cars was causing problems. 

``Moving down into pygmy sized vehicles was not as easy as they thought. 
The Herr Doktor engineers without experience are not finding it so 
easy,'' Rhys said. 

Gilly Filsner, analyst with auto industry consultancy Luwigsen 
Associates, said cost pressures in the industry were adding pressure to 
the development process. 

``Companies have all been trying to reduce the development time from 
concept to market,'' Filsner said. 

``Both these products were very, very innovative vehicles. By their 
nature these are new departures. At least they found out the problems 
early,'' Filsner said.
