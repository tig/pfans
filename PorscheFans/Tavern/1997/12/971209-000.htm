Hey pfans,

A small victory for those of us that think driving is a privelage and
not a right:

Going down 101 this AM in Silicon Valley (Bay Area)
Worse traffic than usual since there were two separate accidents,
one requiring 3 fire trucks :(
(But I digress).

Saw a not unusual sight:  Someone reading while in bumper to bumper
traffic.  Everytime I see this I cringe and grit my teeth and
wonder what goes through these people's minds.  Today, for some
reason, I got eye contact as we were side by side and gave her a
"what are you doing?" look with upraised hands.  She rolls down her
window, laughing and says "what can I say? too much work!!".

Oh yeah, this is the best part, she was not only reading but filling
out a form!!  With a Pen, against the steering wheel!

I continued my look of disbelief and incredulity which caused her
to say  "I'm watching the road!"  I had said nothing at this point
just shaking my head.  Finally she says  "Hey don't be an asshole!".

I thought to myself "what a perfect time to be an asshole".

I said  "How'd you get that big dent in your front fender?"

As it turned out she had a major indent in her right front fender
on her otherwise nice white Honda.  Who knows how it got there
but it was conveniant.

Needless to say she was pissed by now and ignored me.

I felt somewhat defeated in that the only outcome of the event in her
mind was that some prick in a Porsche was mean to her.  Perhaps
the learning opportunity was lost, but at *least* I got her to stop
filling out the form while she was driving.  And God forbid she
might have been so agitated by the exchange that she was even
less focused on driving, but perhaps eventually she will rethink her
position.

I wish I had dollar for everytime I find someone doing this on 101 in
the morning coming down the Peninsula into the Valley.

Bedard once wrote about this phenomenon in Car and Driver (many years
ago).  I found it too amazing to believe until I moved to California
11 years ago.  Now it's common.  Among other amazing feats of
natural selection which can be witnessed daily, this one amazes me
the most.
