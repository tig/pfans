I do not know about the truth, but according to a new book I have just 
received called "Porsche The Fine Art Of The Sports Car" by Lucinda Lewis 
(ISBN # 1-57145-135-8), there are three Auto Union Type C vehicles known 
to exist.

One is the property of the Deutsche Transportation Museum.  In 1982 it 
was brought to Leguna Seca, CA, and run at the track for a crowd of 
spectators.

Pages 32 through 37 were dedicated to this 1936 16 cylinder, 6330 cc, 520 
hp, 930 ft*lb, 2500 lb cigar on wire wheels.  It had a Roots supercharger 
set to 14 psi.  Brakes were standard drum.  However, the engine was in 
the rear and the fuel tank was located between the back of the driver and 
the front of the engine.

The pictures are outstanding in this book and it was available at Sam's 
club for $25.00.  Check it out if you can, it even has the Boxster 
featured in the final pages!
