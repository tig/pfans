This is quite strange. Today I phoned one person at the Valmet Automotive
plant that makes the Porsche Boxsters here in Finland. I was asking stuff
in general about the plant etc, and when I mentioned the 'net the person
almost freaked out. She said that do I know anything about a site that has
information how to tell where a Boxster is made. She also mentioned that
Porsche is giving them shit that they have told the info to someone. What
really makes this intresting, I'm the one that has the #VIN-info my site!
If someone from Porsche is reading this, I _DID_NOT_ get the info from
Valmet Automotive, but here from Porschefans!
  I just don't get why Porsche wants to keep this secret. The world
manufacturing code and the manufacturing location is simple to check. If
you want to see the page which is apparently making Porsche unhappy, check
out the Porsche Info -> Valmet Automotive -> 'Check where you Boxster...'
from PorscheHQ.

PS. Oh yeah.. The vice president of Porsche has said that the quality of
the Boxsters coming from Valmet are _AT_LEAST_ the same as the ones coming
from Germany.
