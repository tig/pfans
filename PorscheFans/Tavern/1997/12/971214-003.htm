Here's a copy of an email I received today. I thought it was amusing so I sent 
it to the list. It appears Santa's slay has more horsepower then all the 
Porsches ever created. Any way enjoy.

SANTA CLAUS: An Engineer's Perspective

I. There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the
world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish
or Buddhist religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of
the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At
an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per house hold, that comes to 108
million homes, presuming that there is at least one good child in each.

II. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the
different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east
to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This
is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has
around 1/1000th  of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the
chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree,
eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into
the sleigh and get on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these 108
million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we
know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of  our calculations), we
are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million
miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is
moving at 650 miles per second --- 3,000 times the speed of sound.  For
purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe,
moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at
best) 15 miles per hour.

III.  The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming
that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego set (two pounds),
the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On
land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting
that the "flying" reindeer could pull ten times the normal amount, the job
can't be done with eight or even nine of them --- Santa would need 360,000 of
them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh,
another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth
(the ship, not the monarch). IV. 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per
second crates enormous air resistance --- this would heat up the reindeer in
the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere.The lead
pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second
each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing
the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The
entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second,
or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it
matters, however, since Santa, as a
 result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would
be subjected to centrifugal forces of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which
seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015
pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a
quivering blob of  pink goo.

 V.  Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.

 Merry Christmas!
