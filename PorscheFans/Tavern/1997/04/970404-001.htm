     Peter Gregg was not killed in a racing accident but rather he shot 
     himself in his car.  His wife was still racing last I heard.

     Hi:
     
       Any folks reading this has to think of the following as if I've
been on the Moon for 10 years, and any responses should keep this in mind! 
     
       I don't want to make a big deal about this, but thought there
would be someone who could complete the picture for me.
     
       OK, I know that Peter Gregg was killed in a racing accident
several years ago, right? For a period of time the Atlanta Porsche dealer 
(Brumos) was open with his wife, Deborah (sp?) in charge. There was a big 
article in Car & Driver about her (not one she could be very satisfied 
with, ISTR).
     
       I don't get into Atlanta that often, but one day I was tooling up
Cobb Parkway and noticed no more Porsche dealer! Didn't think about it 
much at the time; I guess Jim Ellis picked up the business.
     
       So the only dealer at the present time with the name Brumos is in
Jacksonville (always has been?).
     
       My question is whatever happened to Deborah Gregg?
     
       TIA for any and all responses.
     
                                           Harold
