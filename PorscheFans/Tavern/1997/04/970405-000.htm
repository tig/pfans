Greetings,

For Harold Owen, et al

About P. Gregg and Brumos:

- Gregg shot himself on a deserted beach area...after suffering injuries in
a racing accident earlier that year, some people speculate that that
acident pushed the guy over the edge and he caved in. I don't have any
facts here...  I imagine someone like H. Haywood could shed some light on
that one...or maybe some old panorama issues-someone's had to have gone
here before!

- Deborah Gregg is now remarried and yes she was racing... A camaro,or
corvette or something with her husband.  I watched her at Willow Springs
about five years ago( I think) and she didn't do too bad.  I also saw an
article somewhere (car &driver? Autoweek? not sure) on her, where she made
it pretty clear that Gregg/Brumos wasn't a big part of her life anymore...I
seem to remember that she was pretty young was she married Gregg, which
would mean she'd have plenty of opportunities to "start over again"
According to this same article-She is still in Florida.

- I don't know exactly what the deal was with Brumos upon Gregg's death.
Seems to me that the Widow Gregg was in charge for a very brief period.
Brumos is now owned by Bob(?) Snodgrass and I think Haywood has a piece of
the company too.  (If not, then Haywood is still very active as a senior
manager at any rate...) I seem to remember that Snodgrass himself was
around while Gregg, and then later Haywood, were keeping Brumos very much
in the public eye.  Panorama has articles on Snodgrass/Brumos/haywood.  A
good Panorama librarian could help us out here..my own collection only goes
back to when I signed up in 90 or so...

I certainly hope this doesn't add to any confusion.  History fascinates me,
but unfortunately I am relying on what I've read a long time ago (versus
going to my bookshelf and looking all this up)

Cheers
Thom Kuby
