With the increasing popularity of SUV's (my own "other car" is a
Cherokee_), it's natural that every manufacturer, will at one time or
another assess the need to have one.  An interesting angle to Scott
Clapper's report on Porsche's forays into the area is that the Mercedes
M-class is built in the US, which differentiates it from the company's
other carlines.  It also makes it less expensive, and the backed-up
orders for the M-class indicate that it's a winning combination.

I'm just on the sidelines here, but Porsche always blunders when it
tries to market something that its followers don't consider a true
example of the breed.  Porsche affinities go deeper than, say, a Lexus
fan who's happy to purchase a gussied-up Toyota 4-Runner with a Lexus
nameplate.  A Porsche that can't be raced or autocrossed is, to me, an
oxymoron, and having a vehicle called a Porsche that's really something
else with a Porsche emblem stuck on it won't fool anyone.  It also won't
necessarily sell more units.

If you endow a sport-ute with racing characteristics, you lose the
capabilities that made it a sport-ute to begin with.  A few years back,
for example, GM made a specialty version of the Chevy Blazer/GMC Jimmy
and called it the Typhoon.  It was a neat car, but sat lower and had
high-speed tires.  Not a car for anything but a smooth road.  Not to
mention that racing trucks is a very American thing and not really what
one would associate with Porsche. 

Just my admittedly idle thoughts.
