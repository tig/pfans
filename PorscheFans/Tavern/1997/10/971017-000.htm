Porsche to Decide on Sport Utility Car

            Reuters
            17-OCT-97

            STUTTGART, Germany, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Porsche AG will decide this 
year if
            it will add a sports utility vehicle to its line of sports cars, a 
company spokesman
            told Reuters on Friday. 

            ``The decision on if, and with whom, we will build such a car will 
be made this
            year,'' the spokesman said. 

            Porsche, which builds only two models now -- the 911 and the 
Boxster -- has
            been looking for a partner with whom to develop a sport utility 
vehicle and is
            rumoured to be considering a link-up with Volkswagen AG . 

            The spokesman said if Porsche goes ahead with the project, it 
would like to
            begin building the vehicle by 2000 or 2001 and would eventually 
build 15,000
            units a year. 

            He said it was still an option that Porsche would develop a sport 
utility vehicle
            alone, but that it would prefer to find a partner. 

            The sportscar maker had been in talks with fellow Stuttgart 
carmaker
            Daimler-Benz AG to build a version of the new M-Class Mercedes, 
but the deal
            fell through earlier this year. 

            Porsche, which has seen demand for its two existing models outpace 
capacity, is
            anxious to diversify from the often fickle sportscar market with a 
sports utility
            vehicle -- the market which has boomed in recent years in the U.S. 


            Analysts expect the new Porsche might be four-wheel drive, but 
that it would be
            designed primarily as a car for the city, combining Porsche's 
sporty image with
            demand for a roomy alternative to two-seat sports cars.
