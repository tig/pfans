<< (But wait a minute, Pete, aren't you the one given 
 credit/blame for the BMW vs. Volvo wagon test?  Doesn't that count?) >>

Merely a consultant. I reports em like I finds em and I find the 850 Turbo
goes pretty good. And an 850 R will embarrass a lot of things that pretend to
be fast. The Volvo thing is just PART of an overall profile, not a
determining characteristic...  (whew, weaseled out of that one...)

>>I think I may have a shirt or sweater that says Eddie Bauer on the
label.  

Me too. 

>>(But at least I don't have one of Eddie's Ford Explorers.  
By my way of thinking, any city dweller who drives an SUV fits in 
your "Birkenstock" profile.) 

Yup. I have an idea for a franchise -- apply semipermanent mud splatters to
these urban cowboy cars.

>>But don't you think it's a bit unfair to blame someone for
their SO's name?  

No. Names like that are a warning, you proceed with a relationship at your
own risk.

>>And what if MY name were "Muffy" or "Binkie"? 

Then we on P'Fans proceed with this relationship at OUR own risk.

>>Say what???  My dog is a lab mix from the pound.  He's fairly smart,
but...  (I like golden retrievers, though; does that count?  I think 
your choice of dog should be some small, hairless/dustmop breed.  Or
how about cats?  Rabbits?  Weasels?)

A stoat? A ferret? Or the latest rage, iguanas?

I confess I also have an espresso maker.

>>BTW, 
I think I'd include Kenny G type jazz stations on your list.)

Exactly what I was thinking. What a wuss.

>>Sorry.  I've got a vacant lot in McCall, Idaho, though...

Oh, Idaho. You're one of THOSE...

>>>>> None of these things taken separately indicates a problem but if you
>>> match three or more, the PC Police will be at your door...

>>I guess I'll need to keep an eye out; I'm borderline according to your
criteria.

No, since you're one of THOSE, we're sending in the PC FBI, with
flamethrowing tanks and helicopters. Can't be too cautious...  And you see,
you were betrayed by the mere confession of wearing Birkenstocks. 

Pete
