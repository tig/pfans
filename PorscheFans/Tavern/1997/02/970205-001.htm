Pete--

You said:

I think your criteria need some tweaking.  However:

> Do you drive a Volvo?  

No, never!!!  (But wait a minute, Pete, aren't you the one given 
credit/blame for the BMW vs. Volvo wagon test?  Doesn't that count?)

> Wear Eddie Bauer stuff?  

I think I may have a shirt or sweater that says Eddie Bauer on the
label.  (But at least I don't have one of Eddie's Ford Explorers.  
By my way of thinking, any city dweller who drives an SUV fits in 
your "Birkenstock" profile.)

> Significant Other answer to "Muffy" or "Binkie" or something 
> similarly cute? 

No.  I don't think "Mary" quite fits.  (The Catholics seem to like it,
though.)  But don't you think it's a bit unfair to blame someone for
their SO's name?  And what if MY name were "Muffy" or "Binkie"?

> When somebody refers to "The Earth Muffin" do you instantly know 
> that they mean the S.O.? 

I'm not even sure I understand this one.

> Does S.O. drive a domestic minivan? 

Audi A4Q.

> Do you have a golden retriever who's more intelligent than your 
> S.O. and it was the retriever's idea that they go halvsies on bulk 
> purchases of peroxide? 

Say what???  My dog is a lab mix from the pound.  He's fairly smart,
but...  (I like golden retrievers, though; does that count?  I think 
your choice of dog should be some small, hairless/dustmop breed.  Or
how about cats?  Rabbits?  Weasels?)

> Do now, or have you ever, owned and used an espresso machine?  

Yeah, I got one for Christmas a few years ago.  I've used it 3-4
times.  It doesn't do a half bad job, but I prefer my French Roast.

> Do you have a New Age station (i.e. "The Wave") programmed into your 
> car stereo? 

Ugh!  (I'm still mourning the loss of San Diego's old KFSD, the
classical music station with the strongest FM signal in town, which 
became yet another "greatest classical rock of all time" station as a
result of new corporate ownership.  The replacement, located elsewhere
on the dial, with a much weaker signal, and dedicated to 
smooth-sounding syndicated classical jocks who play individual 
symphony movement instead of complete works, drives me crazy.  BTW, 
I think I'd include Kenny G type jazz stations on your list.)

> Do you own a piece of a timeshare condo? 

Sorry.  I've got a vacant lot in McCall, Idaho, though...

> None of these things taken separately indicates a problem but if you
> match three or more, the PC Police will be at your door...

I guess I'll need to keep an eye out; I'm borderline according to your
criteria.

At least you didn't sink into politics or OJ-mania...
