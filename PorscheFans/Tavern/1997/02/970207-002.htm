A penguin was driving through the desert when his car broke down. He
waddled to the nearest phone and called AAA.  They towed his car to the
nearest garage where the mechanic told him he would need a couple of
hours to check out the car.

The penguin, being a good natured bird, didn't complain; he wandered off
to find the closest supermarket.  He proceeded to the frozen foods
section and hung out near the fish sticks.  Later he got in the freezer
next to the vanilla ice cream and ate several gallons. Then he went back
to the garage, covered in ice cream.

The mechanic walked over to him wiping his hands and shaking his head
saying, "It looks like you blew a seal."

Blushing, the penguin said, "Oh no! It's just ice cream."
