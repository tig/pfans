            Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche chairman, attributed the strong 
results largely to
            the popularity of its new Boxster model. 

            "We thank above all the Boxster as the new second model, but also 
strong,
            unbroken demand for the 911." 

            Porsche said it expected to sell at least 38,000 units in the 
1997/98 business
            year as Boxster production starts at the Valmet Automotive plant 
in Finland and
            as Porsche launches a new 911 model. 

            The company said turnover climbed to four billion marks last year, 
incorporating
            a boost of 300 million marks from the consolidation of its U.S. 
and Spanish
            units. 

            Porsche, which makes only two models, the Boxster and 911, has 
been
            producing at full capacity at its Stuttgart plant and did not 
indicate if it would
            take further steps to increase its production potential. 

            With the Boxster selling well, Porsche will introduce the 
successor to its
            34-year-old 911 model at the Frankfurt car show on Tuesday. 

            The car, which carries a 911 badge, has been completely reworked 
and in a
            departure from its predecessor's air-cooled power-plant, will have 
a
            water-cooled engine.
