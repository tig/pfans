VULGAR LANGUAGE USED IN THE OFFICE

  It has been brought to the attention of management that some
  individuals have been using foul language in the course of normal
  conversation between employees.  Due to complaints from some of the
  more sensitive and refined workers, this conduct will no longer be
  tolerated.

  The management does, however, realize the importance of each person
  being able to properly express his feelings when communicating with
  fellow employees.  Therefore, the management has compiled the
  following coded list.  It is imperative that all employees understand
  and implement these phrases so the proper exchange of ideas and
  information can continue uninterrupted.

  me sooner?

  When the fuck am I supposed        Perhaps I can work late.
  to do this?

  Who the fuck cares?                Are you sure it's a problem?

  He's got his head up his ass.      He's not familiar with the problem.

  Eat shit.                          You don't say.

  Eat shit and die.                  Excuse me?

  Eat shit and die, motherfucker.    Excuse me, sir?

  What the fuck do they want         They weren't happy with it.

  Kiss my ass.                       So, you'd like help with it?

  Fuck it, I'm on break.             I'm a bit overloaded at the moment.

  Shove it up your ass.              I don't think you understand.
