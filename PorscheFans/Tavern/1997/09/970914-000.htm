Several folks politely questioned by position on this -- I neglect to
mention that I'm an Australian living in California for the past year.
Take car in Australia over AUD$60,000 (they're almost all imported with the
exception of literally no more than five Australian cars which are based on
$20,000 cars but with a nice engine and lotsa leather.)  Compare the entire
cost of parking that car in your driveway in Sydney or San Francisco.  In
round terms, using the exchange rate, it's twice as expensive and sometimes
three times as expensive.  If you adjust for average incomes it gets worse,
if you adjust for cost of living, it gets a little better (but not much)
and if you look at fuel, service, insurance and running costs (like tyres,
brakes, suspension) over a year or two, it looks terrible.  Fuel and
insurance (for prestige cars) are twice as expensive in Oz.  Ironically,
car insurance for base cars is outrageous in California, but as the price
of the car goes up, it balance out and from my '94 911, it's about half
what I'd pay in Australia.

My first year of ownership in California will be about US$50K or AUD$60K
exchange ballpark.  In Australia, I can't imagine paying under $100K for
the car.  Even a beat up '85 Carrera will go for AUD$60K.  My pristine,
10,000 mile, '94 RS would attract AUD$120K or so.

Sales tax is 8.25% in CA and something like 2% (just for used car sales)
variously around the states of Australia.  But given that the tax is on a
much larger amount, the difference is reduced.  Licence and registration
are relatively small hundred dollar amounts, but Australia has equivalent
fees and they're not cheap.

Insurance would be about AUD$5K (no joke, I had a performance car there
last year and I was paying AUD$2500 for half the value of car and I'm
paying US$1300 for the 911.)

Fuel is US$1.69/gallon and in Australia it's $.82c/litre (for premium 92
RON.)  1 litre = 0.264 US gallon.  So at US$.50/litre with the dollar
conversion or US$2/gallon, it's even a fair bit more expensive (15% or so)
for fuel.

I can only attribute the extraordinary different in retail prices to
government greed.  The fuel price is much the same issue but mitigated to
some extent by market volumes and corporate positions.

Performance tyres in Australia can run AUD$600 each.  A S02 for example is
more like US$220 for a typical front tyre of a 911 and maybe $360 for a
rear.  I can't imagine more than 12 months good wear out of a set of tyres
doing around 15,000 miles.  Aside from being illegal, R1s in Oz are nowhere
near the US$120 or so I've seen.

So, there's some room for trimming these numbers to reduce the gap on
operating costs of tyres, fuel and insurance but nothing escapes the notion
of paying more than twice the price for the car.
