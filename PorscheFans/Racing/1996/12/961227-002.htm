	You are not unique, I think thats why people buy Porsche.

	To race a car means that you will need to modify the car with 
basic safety equipment, and I would not race a car without a full cage!!

	On the track in a race people do strange things, and body damage 
is not unheard up. My first race at Lime Rock started off with the guy in 
front of me spinning into Big Ben. Only quick wits keep me and the people 
behind me from looking like a 7 car pile up.

	I have tought for 5 years before I started to race and it was a 
whole new ball game. Racing is Racing, drivers Ed is just driving fast on 
a track.

	I don't have a trailer I do drive in and back. But anything 
outside of a AAA plus tow limit I beg-or Rent one, you can not count on a 
return trip! Just as you have seen ar Drivers Ed some cars don't go home 
by themselves.

Funny thing is in a Race, you rarely push thuough traffic, the race grid 
is based on lap times, so the guy in front of you got there because he or 
she is faster than you, and the only way you get by them is if you out 
trick, out ball, or they make a mistake. Thats the fact ! 

I know I have driven 11/10 in a race which I could not have done in 
qualifying but I was lucky that my many years of track time keep me in 
one pot, not in a ball.

	After trashing a 944, I re-thought the deal and now have a 
dedicated 914 track car which is disposable. If you realy want to start 
racing, why not start with either a Rent-a-ride (Customer Driven runs 
cars at lime rock) or get a Toy car just for Track. My 914 cost me $1200, 
and then $1500 to get it race ready, then another $1600 for a rebuild 
that I did myself (thats just the parts and machine work). 

ALso plan on every race costing you $1000. (Entry 1/4,prep work 1/4, trip 
1/4, tires (R1's 3 races) Brakes (Cool Carbons ever Race), Rotors (3 
Races), Oil (Moble 1  2 changes a race weekend), food, lodging etc..)

Basicly its costly ! but fun (How do you make a million $'s racing ? 
Start with 5 and quit when you have one left..)

> So, do I go for it? 

Its your nickle and your life Barry, but your are driving a car that can 
get you and it hurt real bad, so if you want to do it, rethink the car.. 
Otherwise have fun.
