hi Guys,

I'm thinking very seriously of club racing at Lime Rock in April.

Is this a good idea?

I've always wanted to race cars. In fact, that's why I bought my
first Porsche - to drive on the track in driver ed days. Since then,
I sold that car (86 944) and bought an 89 951.

This is not a dedicated track car, nor is it my daily driver.
It's a weekend fun car and I don't want to destroy it.

I am in the process of installing a roll bar. I have a 5 point 
harness installed. How difficult is it to install a window net
that can be removed for non-track days, and still leave the 
interior of the car looking decent? Same thing for kill switch.

As far as experience, I drove 15 track days last seaon, all in the
black group (one group below instructors), and 12 days the year before
that, 1/2 in white and 1/2 in black. The year before that was my first
year, and I drove 4 days.

I don't have a trailer, and would drive to the track, race, then
drive home (same as driver ed day). I would not expect to win, or
even be competitive. In fact, coming in last wouldn't bother me 
(well, last place would, but not next to last). My primary goal
would be to bring the car home in one piece, and to experience some
real wheel-to-wheel racing, where the car in front doesn't have to
let me by, and I don't have to wait for a signal.

So, what's the general consensus? Should I race my car, wait until
I have a dedicated trackmobile, or just stick to driver ed events?

Other relevent (or not) information. At Bridgehampton, using stop-
watches, I run laps in the 1:55- 1:57 range. At Lime Rock, it's more dif-
ficult to get accurate times due to traffic, but I believe I'm in
the 1:06 range. I'm currently using either BFG R1's or Yoko A008 RS II's.
From the club race web pages, the Lime Rock times put me towards the
back of the pack. I plan on lowering the car (a little, don't want
problems with the A-Arms), and getting a better alignment. That should
help improve the times a little.

So, do I go for it?
