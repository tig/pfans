Monte,

I think I answered this or a virtually identical query before shutting
down for the holidays.  Just in case, and for your info as well, here's
the answer.

You can remove the cross piece and run stock, since you would no longer
have a wing (leading and trailing edge).  You can use any rear spoiler
(which will have a trailing edge only) stock or non-stock in configuration
and of any material at all, as long as you don't violate the size
restrictions which have been in the rule book since the beginning, or the
"aesthetically pleasing" provision that applies to anything you do to your
car.  Spoilers have always been free, it is only rear wings that are being
made an "improved" change for 97 and perhaps illegal in any stock class as
of 98 (and that latter is largely up to you racers and what we hear from
you at this point).

Thanks for the card and e-mail, Monte.  Glad you are enjoying the snow, or


at least the peace and quiet.  See you and Sue at Sebring.

Harry
