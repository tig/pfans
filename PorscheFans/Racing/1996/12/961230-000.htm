John,

I don't know of any add-on duck tails, but...



You could try calling Gary Kempton at "Made by Hand."  He hand forms a
fiberglass deck lid, with integrated tail, and attaches it to the steel
frame from a stock deck lid.  I hear it's a pretty good replica of the
factory '73 duck tail.

Expect to pay more than the all 'glass tails you see in the Pano or Ex
adverts.  But I suspect it's quite a bit less than trying to buy a
factory item.



He can be reached at 904-926-5722
