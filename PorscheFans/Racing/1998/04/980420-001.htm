Tory and P-fans

I just replaced my rear banana bushings with Weltmeister plastic ones. I
left the outer metal sleeve in the banana and sanded down the bushing to fit
inside. I discarded the inner metal sleeve as the bolt barely fit inside the
bushing by itself.

Seems to fit and work Ok, no wild suspension movement,  actually no sided to
side movement at all, smooth up and down movement only. However I have only
done one race so far with them, and perhaps with time they will wear.

That being said, I also have heard the same bad stories about plastic banana
bushings and bought stock replacement bushings to replace my Weltmeister as
insurance. I haven't done the work yet (I tried to do it without taking the
entire rear apart but couldn't, so I will wait until I need to do another
alignment before I do this work).

Along those lines, replacing the stock bushings looks like it may be a
fairly difficult task. The bushing actually comes as a three part assembly;
an inner sleeve/washer, a rubber bushing, and the outer sleeve. Getting the
old outer sleeves out of the banana will require some work, unless there is
a trick way to slide them out. Might also be a way to disassemble the new
bushing and slide the rubber bushing and inner sleeve into the old  outer
sleeve. Regardless, looks like you need to separate the banana from the
spring plate in order to be able to slide the arm out enough to replace the
bushing. (the pro's are probably laughing by now as I am sure I have
overlooked something)

Please cc me on any responses you get as I am also interested in this topic.

Subject: rear banana arm bushings

Hey all,

I know this is mostly a forum for race questions but I have
thought about this and really think you can help with it..

I am in the process of upgrading my suspension with Weltmeister
racing bushings. I planned on doing the rear banana arm bushings.
I just received an Email stating that some racers had trouble with
the racing bushings, causing weird rear end performance and
falling to pieces. To fix this they reverted back to the factory
bushings. Can someone shed some light on this? I trust the person
I got the formentioned info from but am the type that likes to get
a few opinions before I make my decision..

Thanks as always
