   Kewl, and I accept your *apology* ? I sure didn't wanna affect your sales or business in any way so I will offer this to you and maybe it will help me also. Could you please fax to me the dyno sheets on your 993 systems so I can substantiate the big hp gains you have been getting with your systems. When I see the *DYNO* reports then I can pass them along to whoever buys my used Fabspeed system for a 993 in stainless with the removable mufflers.

   With those *DYNO* sheets in hand I can also begin to try to understand why we haven't been able to reach the same kind of gains that you have gotten. Did you use a *varioram* 993 or a 95 993? Did you make any other mods besides the Fabspeed system?

my fax is 253-536-8442 Anxiously awaiting the *DYNO* sheets ;-)
