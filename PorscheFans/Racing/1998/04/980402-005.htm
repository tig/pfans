My $.02 on these two subjects.

The SCCA GCR says the shoes must have either Nomex or Leather uppers.  I
don't remember seeing the start of this conversation, but if it has to do
with wrestling shoes, the problem with those is that some have nylon as
part of the upper contruction.  This melts in a hurry and can cause severe
burns on your feet.  I knew of one guy that drove in his old leather
boots.  Athletic shoes, as long as they have all lether uppers are
perfectly acceptable.  I prefer real driving shoes, as they are a cut very
narrow and provide better feel on the pedals.

As far as towing goes, I remember being told that you DON'T want to use
any part og the car as a tie down that will compress the suspension.  You
want to let the car bounce freely to assorb the bumps with it's own
suspension.  I guess it's easier on the trailer suspension, I don't know
for sure.  I run the straps through the wheels.  I used to use the front
control arms and the bottom of the shock where it bolts to the banana arm
on the rear.  The only reason I switched is that I was tired of crawling
under a hot car to attach the straps.
