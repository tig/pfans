No, I don't think you are out of line.  I think there should be a rule =
that
there will be NO ADVERTISING allowed.  Violators should be warned then
prohibited from posting if they continue.  Sometimes the line between
answering someone's question and advertising can get a bit blurry.  My
feeling is that a commercial business that promotes their product over
another is advertising, not answering questions.

=46or instance, everyone on the 924-944 list knows George B. runs a =
business,
but you don't see him promoting it directly, he just answers a lot of
questions based on his expertise.  Others do the same and I don't have a
problem with that.  However, if someone says, so and so's "whatever" =
isn't
any good and that you should contact me for something better, that's
advertising.
