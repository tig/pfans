Hi Gang,

     I am probably out of line, and if so, please someone tell me so, but I
was wondering if anyone else besides myself is getting tired of reading the
Fabspeed
advertising weekly or even more often, in our porsche fans board.  Perhaps I
am being too nit picky, and I am sure Joe is a really nice guy, but if I want
to pay to read advertising, then I will pick up a copy of Excellence or Pano
or search the website . . . I have a limited amount of time to read this
material every day and it is bothesome to have to scroll down the list which
includes advertising.   I am sure that Joe is not the only one guilty, but he
just seems to pop up more than anyone else.

     And If I have offended anyone, please excuse, that was not the point . .
.. and as stated before I am sure Joe is a really nice guy, and Fabspeed is a
wholesome place to buy exhaust . . . the point is, I am not interested in the
advertising.  I will now don my nomex underwear and drivers suit, as I am sure
someone out there will flame my tail.

      David
