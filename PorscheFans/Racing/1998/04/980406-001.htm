From: Fabspeed@erols.com
	Someone wanted to add 18" wheels to a 993 cabriolet. I am reading from the
factory Technical Service Bulletin #9604 Part ID 4440 Group 4:
	Subject: retrofit of 18" wheels date of Bulletin 2/27/96
	Models affected: 1995 993 carrera and Carrera 4 Coupes
			1996 993 Carrera, C4 cabriolet
			targas not approved
My Summary of this 2 page bulletin:
	This was the info in affect at the time- 2 years has passed since the date
of publishing therefore I am quoting the info which may have changed.

	Porsche depending on Vin # and year added several parts to reinforce the
front end steering rack mounting points of 993s. Porsche continues and
states that this bracket is already installed on 1996 carrera Coupes and
cabriolets. Also approved besides the 1996 993s are 1995 993 Coupes after
VIN # 99 7 SS 323 614 These parts are:
				Support bracket # 993 347 131 02
				Allen Bolt M8*60 Quantity 2 #999 218 102 09
				Allen Bolt M8*80 Quan. 2 #999 218 103 09
		Torque the allen head bolts to 45nm or 32.5ftlbs.

	Porsche fans this looks like a simple bracket that spans between the
steering pump and rack and just needs longer allen bolts to replace the
shorter stock bolts. Looks as if it a simple retrofit. Since my Bulletin
was dated 2/27/96 and  2 years have transpired call you P car dealer or
independent shop and see if your targa or cabriolet was allowed and etc.

Also Joe Vatter in FL Techart Distribuitor,  a great guy, can shed light on
what the Germans are doing and common sense regarding 18" wheels and
empiracle evidence in Germany. I hope this info helps you.
