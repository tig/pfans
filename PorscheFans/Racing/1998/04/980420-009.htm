> 		1. lose the ZR1 tail on the end of your messages. Its childish and 	
redundant. Other P-Fans agree.
> 		2. I heard about your 993 that you wrecked on the track and converted
to a 2100lb 3.8L race car. Who did you hire to drive that was smoking
> everyone at THUNDERHILL and Sear Point?
> 		3. Lastly, my 993 systems are all T304SS. Fabspeed quality
> and performance has evolved- this is why the price has risen. If you had
taken your

of

> Also, my one 993 exhaust system has more Stainless Steel than all of your
> Chevrolets! Lets melt them all down and find out!
