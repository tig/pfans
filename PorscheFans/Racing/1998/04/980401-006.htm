Hi,

off? 

Yes I think so. It was a long tow and I had the straps pretty tight.
I didn't notice until I got home and checked the alignment.

It is a contant tug and vibrations might make it come loose.
Also my bolts were well worn which wouldn't help.

> Not much else to hook onto at rear, either.

I was running supertrapps so I had access to the center
area of the engine. On my '72 I enlarged the hole
in the rear of the engine metal under the fan crank pulley
area.  Bad explanation as I can't remember exactly but I think
it was a thick steel piece. I got one of the chain connectors that's
like a C with a screw-on closure on the open side, and
chained it to the trailer that way. I was able to keep the
chain tight and sometimes used slightly loose straps around
the wheels for extra protection. That worked well.

My '73 has a tow loop under one of the rear wheel
arches (and one in front near the front torsion bar mount too) 
which the '72s did not have. I have had a '73 E that had these
too, not sure about other years. I would like to weld another tow 
loop on the opposite side in the rear, then the rear and front will be all set
for safe towing (on my trailex facing forward as it's now set up for a 911!).
