Hey all,

Well as always once I start something I usually don't quit till I
get it, or beat it, or until it's really late that if I don't stop
I'll break something..

Anyways, After a couple of hours of struggling I got both A-arms
off and am in the process of removing the stuck sway bar mounts
and installing the U-Tabs. Also while I have the car apart I'm
installing race bushings and cleaning the undercarriage of the
car.

Now the fun begins trying to get the bushings out!! ICk that looks
like it's going to be a 6 pack of pepsi project for sure. Anyways
enjoy your weekend, and well if your in The bay Area guess we get
to suffer through another bleak weekend. 

Tory *Getting sick of California Weather* Blue
1974 911 Targa w/stuff and getting more stuff!!!

Also pretty happy with the suspension, rack etc's condition. All
the balljoints are good and tight, all bolts (except for  that one
shock bolt) took a lil tug and came out without a complaint.. It's
nice to have this kind of car to work on!!!
