My wife and I participate in several driver's ed events (she's the
instructor, I'm still learning) a season, sharing our stock powered '86
911.  On very warm days, we have experienced some increases in oil temps,
while running at Watkins Glen and other long tracks.   We have removed the
front fog lights to increase airflow to the front cooler, and this has
helped.   To enhance the flow of air through the cooler we are thinking of
attaching a piece of aluminum to the bottom of the front airdam, below the
fog light, (where the stock horns are mounted).  We feel this will force
the air to go through the cooler, as opposed to letting the air take a
course of less resistance, and flow out under the car.

Neither of us wish to remove the passenger headlight and drill holes in the
body.

Is this a sound idea?

thanks,
