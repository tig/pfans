	Porsche 911 seat belt bolts are SAE 7/16. Not Metric. You will be able to
pick up bolts at any hardware store. Ideally you DEFINETELY should get AN
quality bolts for seat belts and race harnesses. AN is an acronym for ARMY
NAVY and Military spec. Many Motorsport catalogues carry the AN, all real
race cars and aircraft utililize AN. AN have many grades up to
superhiquality 12points. AN bolts are without threads on all the length (
called grip length- same as Porsche) so the threads dont eat away at the
plates and whatever you are putting the bolt through. 
	Grade 8 is junk for seatbelt, rollcage, and critical installations.
Quality AN bolts are forged and then and only then are the threads colded
rolled onto the shanks. Grade 8 and others have the threads simply cut onto
the shank in a lathe which induces cracks and easily snap. This is why it
is almost impossible to snap or shear an AN bolt. Accurate Aerospace
610-566-8182 sells to all the race teams 
( Penske, Fabspeed, etc) and Boeing, McDonnel Douglass, Grumman, General
Dynmics. If you are ever in the area the owner is a racer and has the
wildest AN pieces to over $1000 Titanium 12 points. Its not geek shit but a
race emporium too.
