Well,

Hmmmm, I'm not impressed, but as always I'm impressed with how
Scotty handled your insults. I'm sure this is a pretty
professional group of subscribers, hell they have to be doing
something right to have these toyz, and bashing people or other
vendors is in bad judgement.
Sorry Joe I don't think you did yourself any favors with your ill
thought out reply. As one person told me, okay several, NEVER
EMAIL WHEN YOUR ANGRY! Or if you do, type all you want then hit
DELETE. It will serve you much better in the future.

Anyways, I wouldn't take scotty on in anything, even flame wars,
the "big" guy can handle his own. Also I wouldn't be one to walk
up to Scotty and call him fat. Although he might find it amusing.

I just think people should think and take some deap breaths before
spouting off with an Email..

Just my own "opinion" on this subject.
