Hi there, well I figured this subject had probably been flogged to death
numerous times so I tried Charlie Kindel's archive search app (cool! thanks
Charlie) and it didn't come up with as many articles as I thought it would.
(Apologies if my archive search string didn't return the correct data and
this subject *has been* repeatedly thrashed!)

So here's the background: 

I have a '97 C4S with RSR suspension that weighs ~3450lbs with driver and a
full tank of fuel. Camber is close to -1.5 degrees all around, front and
rear. I have R1s on the new Kinesis Supercup wheels (imo, looks sharp!) in
245/45x17 front and 315/35x17 rear. I've been told to run 28psi front and
30psi rear. Following BFGs recommendation would yield 34/36 front/rear
pressures. It was also recommended to run +1psi on the right side at SIR and
+1 on the left at PIR.

I did find this tidbit in my archive search: "I start my day with the tires
30 psi front /32 psi rear, and bleed them after every session to obtain 32
F/34 R hot. This seemed to work for me without too much wear. Occasionally I
would run them lower, but tried not to in order to make them last longer
(went through 4 sets last year anyway)." Apparently this is on a Carrera SC
running 245/45-16 in front and 275/40-17 rear.

Here are my questions:
1. What pressures do those of you with similar cars run for DE events?
2. Anyone ever tried the +1psi trick on tracks with the big, fast turns
being predominantly right or left? Does this help keep side to side tire
wear more even?
3. I would really like to run the R1s at PIR which means about a 600 mile
round trip from Seattle since I don't have a trailer (yet!). Will this one
trip use up the R1s?
4. Is the technique described above of bleeding the air pressure back to
+2psi of cold psi after each session a good idea?
5. Based on the wear pattern of my street PZeroes it looks like I will be
replacing the rear set twice for every one replacement of the front set. I'm
assuming this will be true of the R1s also. Accurate assumption?

I'm not interested in shaving the last tenth of a second off my time at the
expense of rapid tire wear, I'd rather have them last longer. It would be
great if I could hook up with someone knowledgable about R1 pressures at SIR
on 5/2 who wouldn't mind going over this with me.

TIA from a novice at this.
