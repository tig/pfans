Subject: Racing Shoes (fire proof)

Josh commented last time:

<<<<<
"Yes, they have better construction, and are probably more durable, and
certainly cheaper. But they are -not- fire retardant. And that is a
requirement in most road racing venues."
>>>>>

Steven Stomski responded:

<<<<<
Last I heard most (if not all) race shoes were NOT fire
"proof/resistant."  I have a pair of Simpsons that I am pretty sure are
just leather, without any Nomex, etc.  Wear Nomex socks and keep this
little piggy from going to the barbecue!
>>>>>

Many purpose made driving shoes use Nomex in their construction.
However, the SCCA only requires shoes with leather uppers, e.g. no
canvas or rubber. You could compete in a pair of Bally dress shoes if
you wanted and attend the formal dinner in your tux underneath your
driving suit - shades of James Bond???
