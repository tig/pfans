>>Along those lines, replacing the stock bushings looks like it may be a

an inner sleeve/washer, a rubber bushing, and the outer sleeve.<<

I got them assembled in one piece and installed them assembled.

I pried them away from the banana with a screwdriver and hammer
(like a chisel) then pried them out. Not too hard but a real pain.

>> Might also be a way to disassemble the new
bushing and slide the rubber bushing and inner sleeve into the old  outer
sleeve. Regardless, looks like you need to separate the banana from the
spring plate in order to be able to slide the arm out enough to replace the
bushing. (the pro's are probably laughing by now as I am sure I have
overlooked something) <<

I was able to do it w/o removing the banana the 2nd time but not much
room to work. maybe I had the engine out at the time.

 Also remember to jack up the banana to near normal ride
angle before tightening the banana bushing or it will bind.
Mine broke after a day of driving - the center bolt hole sleeve metal
part was welded to the end plate/washer but the weld broke from
the stress and sounded like a shotgun in the car! I did not
know what it was until I pulled the arm again and saw the
broken weld. But it works fine (better?) with the center
not attached to the end plates as it allows more freedom
of movement I think. So I left it alone.
