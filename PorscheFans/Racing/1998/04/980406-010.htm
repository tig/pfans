I purchased this car in July of 1997 and Immediately sent it to a buddy of
mine, Martin Plummer @ GENESIS MOTORSPORTS in Greenville, South Carolina for a
working over……unfortunately he found that it was in need of much work…so
thinking I wasn't ever, ever, ever going to sell it…I bit the bullet and did
much needed and unneeded work (totaling a bit over $7500) to the car b/c it
was going to be my daily driver….I started driving it in November of
1997…after a distressed Land Rover sale…anyway here is a list of the parts and
things done to the car:

The Parts listed above are for a complete service, transaxle rebuild, clutch
renewal, resealing front and rear of motor, reconditioning/ rebuild of Air
Conditioning, New Brakes, replacement of old vacuum lines and power steering
lines, replacement of exhaust manifold gaskets and seals, and Timing belt
replacement and retensioning, and other miscellaneous maintenance.  By the
way…the previous owner put in a new windshield due to a flying stone on the
highway….he also replaced the Front Wiper Motor and the driver and passenger
window motors.  The car also has a new set of Dunlop D40M2's (225/50 and
245/45)  I have put 7K miles on the car since the major overhaul and it is a
blast to drive and gets 25 mpg on the highway.  I drive regularly from
Birmingham, Alabama to Spartanburg, South Carolina on Weekends (330 miles one
way)

I have also upgraded the Sound System with an Eclipse CD Player, Coaxial
Eclipse Speakers in Factory Locations, Phoenix Gold Subwoofer Amp---and custom
unobtrusive Rockford Fosgate 10" removable subwoofer enclosure.  I also had an
Avital(Clifford) alarm system put in.  This was all done by a reputable, and
quality Audio Shop.

I am unfortunately selling this car due to the a need…I have to, must, gotta
have a convertible….I am asking $13,500, which is less than I have in it…and
with the work done to it…the car should last for another 100K miles…I am
however negotiable and will entertain trades of maybe a 944S2 Cabrio, 968
Cabrio, or maybe a 911 Cabrio, or maybe defect to a 94 BMW 325IC if anyone has
one of those.  I can be reached at home (205) 402-2002, please leave a message
if I'm not in, or via email..  NGS88@aol.com   Serious buyers only
please…thanks…Nitin G. Shanbhag
