Some of you may remember me asking last year where I could get those
cool PCA Club Racing stickers that adorn all the Club Racer's cars. Ted
Smith suggested I call PCA National because that's where he got his. I
finally got around to it last week. I spoke to "Ruth" (I assume that's
*the* Ruth) and I was told yes, that's where you get them but no, I
can't get any because they're only for the Club Racers themselves.

Huh? What? Does anyone know why that is? I mean, that doesn't make any
sense from my perspective. If I want a NASCAR sticker, I can buy
thousands of them without having to race in the Winston Cup. Ditto for
USA Cycling. You'd think they'd want to get Porsche people excited about
Club Racing and promote it rather than implying that if you're not a
Club Racer, you're not cool enough to have a sticker. Anyone interested
in sending me a couple of stickers if I send you some cash for them?
Thanks...
