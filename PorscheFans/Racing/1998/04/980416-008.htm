I'm confused. Most of us would like less understeer, but we don't want much 
more oversteer. Can we have it? Or must we walk some kind of a tightrope, 
reducing the car's desire to plow in sharp corners while increasing its tendency 
to fly off the course backwards in fast sweepers? 
We are told that for LESS understeer, we should mount smaller front 
springs/bars or bigger rears, or a smaller front sway bar (or adjust to lengthen the 
arm) & a larger rear, or we should add weight to the rear, or install softer front 
shocks & harder rears, or increase negative camber at the front & positive at the 
rear, or raise the front tire pressure & lower the rear, or widen the front track & 
narrow the rear, or even, gasp, install bigger front tires & smaller rears. For more 
understeer, we should reverse all this. Do some of these changes reduce 
understeer but hold oversteer constant, or decrease understeer but increase 
oversteer? 
Sorry for the bandwidth, but I suspect I may not be the only one who has 
wondered about this. Would someone with a lot more experience suggest how 
we should think about this problem?
