<pre>
autocrosses, and have the bug....
 
I just bougth a 1976 coupe to build a track car.  But would like to find out
more about the PCA club racing program.  As I have already meet with and know
all of the details of the local MC sports club car racing club.  I need to
find out the details of PCA Club racing so I can build the car up to the specs
that meet both groups but doe not classify the car into a class that is
outside my driving skills. 

Please let me know who I should contact or where I can find out more about the
"GCR" "General Classification Rules" for PCA Club Racing.

I planned on keeping the 1976S to a 2.7S engine/Webers, class car so I could
run non PCA events such as Vintage and Improved Touring in addition to PCA
Club racing.

Please give me your input and direction as I want to learn from this groups
experience and not spend money building a car that can not be used in the PCA
group.
