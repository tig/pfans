I've never run one in a 911 (I'm water-cooled, eh?) but they make a big
difference in other applications. Typically a wild V8 cam will actually
idle, chokes become almost superfluous, miss is greatly reduced,  basically
the engine is a lot less sensitive to mixture variations.

Supposedly the Crane is the hot ticket now, or the Jacobs, but I honestly
don't follow the hype.

Note to get the full effect of an MSD you need  a wider spark plug gap,
well-placed spark plug wires, and preferably a wide rotor and distributor
cap (look at a Ford system to get the idea). I don't know if such things
are made/adapted to Porsches. Most air-cooled folk around here go
dual-plug, which is the same sort of concept as MSD, only much better.
Also, make sure you mount the MSD where it will get cooling - heat burns
these things out *real* fast, especially if you use the rubber mounts.
