Nathan,

Based on your description, the first thing I'd want to know is: when you 
wiggle a tire fore-and-aft, does the opposite side move also?

Remember that the steering system is connected all the way across the 
car, from one tie-rod, through the steering rack, then through the other 
tie-rod.  If you've ruled out the tie-rods, you maay want to look at the 
steering rack...these have wear items, just like any other moving part.

If this were happening on my 911, I'd R&R or replace the steering rack 
and add turbo tie-rods.

BTW, you want to be careful about torquing too hard on the wheel 
bearings. This can cause problems.

I am in Long Beach.  If you continue to have trouble, maybe I can 
help...E- me privately.
