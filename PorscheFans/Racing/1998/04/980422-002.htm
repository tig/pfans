<<<Hmmmm, I'm not impressed, but as always I'm impressed with how
Scotty handled your insults. I'm sure this is a pretty
professional group of subscribers, hell they have to be doing
something right to have these toyz, and bashing people or other
vendors is in bad judgement.
Sorry Joe I don't think you did yourself any favors with your ill
thought out reply. As one person told me, okay several, NEVER
EMAIL WHEN YOUR ANGRY! Or if you do, type all you want then hit
DELETE. It will serve you much better in the future. >>>

Was Fabspeed's reply to Scotty public or private? If it was public he
deserves all the bashing you guys apparently feel he deserves. But if it
was private email that Scotty disclosed publicly then I have to say that
Scotty is guilty of a major netiquette booboo himself...

IMHO, of course,

Paul Foster
