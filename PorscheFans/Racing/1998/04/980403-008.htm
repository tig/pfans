George, I got these about 6 months ago on my '87 911 (all stock) and like them
very much.  The only other tires I had experience with on a 911 were Michelin
XGT-Z, and the Firestones are *WAY* better in all respects (handling,
especially the turn-in transient, noise, traction, road smoothness).  I also
went by the Tire Rack data and some first-hand info from Mustang and Corvette
owners in the respective newsgroups.  I have not been at an autox or DE with
them yet but plan to soon.  (I purchased the car in 8/96 and the PO had the
Michelins on them.  He said they were the worst of all the tires he'd had on
the car and himself recommended Yoko AVS Intermediates.)
