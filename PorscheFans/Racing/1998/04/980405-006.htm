<< 
 My brakes are the standard aluminum calipers with stock Jurid pads, no
 cooling ducts and still have the backing plates in place. I used Castrol LMA
 fluid. 
 
 I plan to remove the backing plates, go to a Performance Friction pad,
 either the D-80 or D-90, and switch to ATE Blue fluid. If this doesn't work
 then I will have to add ducts and probably will go with a new fiberglass
 valance with front oil cooler cut out. >>

The ATE will help a lot, I used that yesterday in my RS and the pedal got a
bit
soft at Lime Rock (pretty hard braking) after 2 sessions but was not bad
after all 4 sessions (plus 1 session the previoius week). The pads will
help a lot too as will the cooling ducts (I have both). 
My calipers were not even hot by the time I got back to the pits
after the cooldown lap!
 
> I ran my old 7" and 8" wheels with R-1's at 21 psi front and 25 psi rear.

I was running higher but tried low-mid 20s yesterday and felt better.
I started on 7 and 9 x 16 w/ 205/55 and 245/45 (3 yr old tires!) and changed
to 7 and 8 x 15 with 225/50 and 245/50 and liked the 15s much better
(maybe because newer tires - not used on the street and only a year or so
old).

>> I switched out the T-bars to 28 mm rear and huge 23mm front. I gambled a
 little on the front with 23mm rather than the typical 22 mm, but it seemed
 to work fine handling very neutral through a variety of turns. <<

I have 21 and 27 but felt a bit floaty on turn-in (w/ 2 year old Konis).
Steady state balance is quite good. Maybe I should try adjusting the Konis
or my Sport Bilsteins from the S.

>> AX'ing may be
 a different story as it may have a more noticeable push in the slower turns.
<<

Yes, probably.

>> I got pinched for time and cash and elected for the Weltmeister 22mm sway
bars. At the race I took a look at some Charlie bars and would definitely
put those on my Christmas list, they attach to the factory mounts on the
swing arms and appear to adjust in a much more user friendly manner. <<

I have the AJR bars and I don't like them much either. the Charlie bars mount
to
the stock ball on the bananas?

> Keep me posted on your progress
  
I started out cautiously and let everyone pass, but by the 4th
session there were only a few cars that passed as
I gained confidence in the car and tires. I still couldn't go
as fast as some cars (even I-stock class 924Ss!) in the fast turns
but still could pass them on the straights, and faster than
almost anybody under braking and slow turns (due to
autox I guess!). I still have a lot of work to do to get a few
seconds faster to keep up with D cars, maybe some Hoosiers
or at least fresh tires would help.

I'm having problems fitting any tires on the front with my '86 944
8 x 16 wheels - they rub at the top of the bumper/bottom of the
front fender join area. I moved the spoiler/bumper forward but now
it's still rubbing on the fender corner at 200 degrees steering lock
on the outer edge of the tire. I guess it's time for some bending/
grinding but I hate to do anything like that on this pristine car.
Anyone have any ideas on making room? Would maximum
caster help without hurting handling? Seems '74+ cars
have more room in this area due to fenders being cut off higher.

I also have to find and remove a dozen or so acorns that I hear
moving from side to side when I slalom! Maybe above and behind
the rear seats where there is a chamber that they could be hiding in...
I pulled several out of the pedal area and tunnel already!
