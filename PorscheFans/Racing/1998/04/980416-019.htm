	Those temps sound about what I get. Although I can get the temp up
to
	250 really quick at a time trial (like 3-4 laps at stapelton).

	Where in back? On the engine lid? Under the rear trunk?

	I put a hanger off the Transmission hanger off to the right
(Passenger side) I am running Kerby Hunter headers which move the heat to
left side. I let the hanger drop the cooler down low upright. No fan but it
gets air. I have been told the problem is the -10 line, I am thinking about
pluming it as follows:
1.	replace the sandwich plate with a in-line plate
2.	Install an oil thermostat so that the oil flows just through the
remotely mounted oil filter.
3.	When oil is up to temp. then move the oil through cooler and then to
oil filter


	I think I will put the oil filter on the trunk and keep the cooler
in the back. That will keep the lines safe and short.
	One thought was to put a small spare cooler in the drivers
compartment with a computer fan to blow some heat in the car in the winter.

	My friend Gary put a Mazda RX-7 cooler in the front trunk, it is
short and long with a thermostat built in. Then he just took the cap plugs
off behind the bumper, and put a pair of vents in trunk floor, it seems to
work well.
