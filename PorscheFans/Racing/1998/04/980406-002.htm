> I found the oversteer.  I went to an AX yesterday; new place.  It was
> a huge lot, about a 1min course (no double loops) and with several
> elevation changes.  On my second run I was coming up a hill into about
> a 60 degree box that led to a U-turn right before the finish.  There
> was about a 50-60 yard straight into the box and another 75-100 yard
> straight aproaching the U-turn at the finish.  Also, the first gate of
> the U-turn forced you to tighten your line (effectively a sweeper with
> a decreasing radius) after the box.  I came through the box probably
> at 50-55mph with the tail stepping out slightly, as I tightened up
> slightly for the U-turn (figuring I had enough grip left at the rear)
> the tail started to come around even more.  Uh-oh.  Time to correct.  
> 
> (Mind you, all my AX experience is an Integra GSR.  When the tail
> stepped out, a quick flick of the wheel brought it back in line no
> problem.  I soon learned that my experience in a FWD/front-engined car
> was not relevant.)
> 
> It is so much easier to follow your gut reaction than your brain's
> reaction.  At 60mph, I didn't even talk to my brain.  I immediately
> let off.  (OOOPPPPS).  Holy *&@$%!!!  I caught the spin with a quick
> reaction at the wheel.  However, rather than stepping back in line,
> the rear end just hung out like a cool surfer dude with his toes over
> the edge.  I proceeded to slide sideways for about 50 yards; smoke
> everywhere (tire fortunately). I ended up about 135 degrees off the
> direction I had intended to follow.  Well it was fun, nobody got hurt
> and I may have enough sense to listen to my brain next time (although
> I doubt it).  Anyway, my shenanigans were good for a deep belly laugh
> from the onlookers (especially the two more experienced 911 owners in
> attendance).
> 
> Actually, by far my biggest problem was with understeer.  There were
> three U-turns throughout the course, and I ended up coming close to or
> catching a cone at the far end of the corner in each case.  No matter
> how much I tried to slow down, left-foot brake or power out the front
> end simply refused to come around.  I was travelling at speeds that I
> know the Integra would have been able to handle.  Barring kitty litter
> in the trunk, is there any way to correct this?  It is a substantial
> problem and VERY FRUSTRATING!!  Maybe I just need to buy a softer (or
> even better- adjustable) front bar.  I don't want to do anything that
> will improve AX at the detriment of higher-speed (track) performance.
> Maybe a stiffer bar at the rear?  Maybe both?  For now and if
> possible, I would like a solution with the stock suspension.  Thanks.
