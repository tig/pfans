I am going to install stiffer torsion bars in my 82 911SC - 22
mm front, 29 mm rear.  I am planning to have the local Porsche
shop do the rears along with the alignment and corner
balancing.  I am looking for suggestions as to what camber and
toe settings to request for the front and rear.  The car is set
up as follows:

	Lowered to "euro spec" w/ bump steer corrected
	Bilstein sport shocks and struts in Bilstein strut housings
	225/50/15 front, 245/50/15 rear BFG R1s
	Stock swaybars

Use is about 75% street, 25% track (moving more and more
towards track use).

The current alignment settings are "factory", with about 1
degree negative camber in rear and 0 in front.  I have noticed
an extreme amount of camber change on the outside wheels during
cornering on the track that was easily seen in photos of the
car as it went through the corners:

Hopefuly the stiffer tbars will help with this but it is
unclear to me what the proper amount of negative camber will be
for the combination of stiffer tbars and R1s - anyone out there
w/ experience?

Thanks,
