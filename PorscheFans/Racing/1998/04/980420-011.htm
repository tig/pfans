Max, if it's any help, when I had my '76 with the 6x15 cookie cutters, I
went to 205/60X15 VR all around.  never had a problem, on track, 
autocrossing, or on street.  This was with several differnt brand tires, incl.
Yoko A008RS and BFG R1, as well as (as I remember) BFG T/A VR
and Michelin XGT VR.

In a message dated 98-04-20 03:02:17 EDT, you write:

 I am looking to replace the tires for my 1977 911s.
 The car has on now 4 COMP T/A 205/60 15" HR's tires.
 The rear of car however suggests to have 185/70 15" VR's.
 I would like to have 205/60 15" VR's. Can I go with a wider tire without
 changing rims !?
 Looking around for great tires at a good price.
 Please let me know if you can help or if I could use other tire sizes that
 you might have.
 Thanks ,
