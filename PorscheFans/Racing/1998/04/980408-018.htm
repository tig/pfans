   With the cars we drive, tire noise is not an issue ;-) HGowever
treadwear, stick and wet wheather performance is of utmost performance. We
have been running V-700s for 2.5 years with great success with many PCA club
poles and victories and many SCCA victories in both SOLO, Pro SOLO and club
racing. Wear is comparable to RSIIs and the stick is waaaaaaayyyyy better.
As far as wet wheather performance the only thing better is hand grooved
hooters ;-)

   Call Mike Taylor @ 1-888-77-KUMHO and tell him Scotty B sent you, he'll
take good care of you.
