   Hey joe, one more thing that might help you from being so unhappy. I too
have been flamed for responding publicly to posts inquiring about my sponsor
(kumho tire) and I have began responding privately (when i can remember to
do so)to these requests for information and letting the product speak for
itself as all good products do ;-)

   I also refrain always from bashing the competition (bfg,hooter etc...)
and that is recieved well. I guess I might be guilty of bashing your product
but that was not my intention. I meant merely to state a few facts that are
true as can be ;-)

C ya joe.
