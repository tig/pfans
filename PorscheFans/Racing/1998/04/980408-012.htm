You had mentioned webers - in PCA racing they will put you in the modified
class on a normally CSI injected 2.7. Only exhaust may be changed
in the stock classes.

Not a problem if it meets the weight for the car you want
it to be.
  
>  2) I want Slant Nose  Turbo Styling and fenders,  will this effect my class

To keep in a stock class with turbo fenders you will have to run it as 
a car that came standard with a wide body like a 3.2 Carrera turbo 
look (and would need to use that engine too). 
Slant nose would not be allowed though in stock class.

Slant nose is allowed in prepared class (one stock class
faster than normal class for your car), where you can also
run the wide body fenders on a car not normally equipped that way.
Then you could run it as whatever 911 came with your
type engine (i.e. run it as a 1976 911 2.7).

Stock class is 1" wider than stock, prepared is 2" wider
so 9/10s would only be legal if you run it as a prepared '74-'75 Carrera
(stock was 7-8) which would be in class F (bumped from G).

You need complete interior for the year/model you are running
it as, in addition to meeting minimum weights. Otherwise
you are in the mod cla$$.
