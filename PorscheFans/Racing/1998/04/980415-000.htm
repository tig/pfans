I too, have seen this done and it looks great.  There is a local PCA member
that has done it in chicago.

I also am just purchasing a tub from a gentleman that has it done.  The body
is in primer still, so you can see how it was done.

Apparently when you grind them off, it leaves a gap which then needs to be
filled with a "L" shaped replacement edge of metal.

If done properly it appears that it is just as strong as the original weld.

I assume that it may create some wind noise or whistling in the door / window
seals as there is no deflector now.   But at the same time with out any
deflector, the air flow will be cleaner (I am sure that is why the race teams
do it.)

Since I have yet to pick this car up I would appreciate any info or warnings
about such a modification to the chassis.
