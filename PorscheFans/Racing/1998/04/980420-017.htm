Jens,
Personally, I stay with the family at the Osthoff in Elkhart Lake. It's 
clean and modern, comparable to a Marriott Suites and there's a pool and 
activities for the kids. If you're coming with others than splitting the 
cost of a room might be one way to go. There is also Siebkins across the 
street which has ... character (some rooms with shared bathrooms :-) and 
more simple but hardly spartan accomodations. Both are right in town and 
close to the track.

One year I tried an alternative, checking into a local B&B called Beverly's 
Log Guest House in Plymouth. It is about 15 minutes south of the track. But 
I remember how beautiful and peaceful the drive through the back country 
was at 6.30am with the fog lying in the hollows of the Wisconsin farmland 
as the morraines rolled away on either side of the road. Bev got up early 
to make coffee and muffins. I paid $75 in 1995 and thought it was just 
fine. Her number is (414) 892 6064. The local chamber of commerce in 
Elkhart has a list of other B&Bs if you give them a call.

Cheers,
