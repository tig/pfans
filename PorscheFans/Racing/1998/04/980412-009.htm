Not at all! As a matter of fact it's commonplace.

If you're going to pinch wide tires onto 5.5" Fuchs alloys, you should
go with R1s. The very stiff sidewalls have the added advantage of
enabling you to pinch the tire onto rather narrow rims without
excessively rounding the contact patch.

I don't know about Kumhos on a narrow rims, I do know that people have
had good results with Hoosiers on the 5.5" rim, so maybe the Kumho would
work, but I do knwo that the R1 is just fine on a narrow rim.
