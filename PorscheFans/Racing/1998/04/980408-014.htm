I would like to second the suggestion made by Chip.

PMO's carburetors should solve all of the inherent design problems with
these carbs. Richard's design is quite sound and these should run very,
very well with almost any camshaft without displaying the low-speed,
small-throttle-opening types of drivability problems that Webers have
displayed in the past.

He is making these carbs in 40mm-46mm-50mm. This will be quite
competitive with any FI systems short of throttle slides.   :^)

FYI, we have used Webers on all sorts of 911's since 1977 and some of
them, including mine, havent been touched for over 10 years. The IDA 3C
series hold their adjustments quite well with the exception of  throttle
shaft and bushing wear that causes some rough idling.
I would characterize them as being quite reliable and trouble free. They
do require two things however, clean fuel and controlled fuel pressure.
The float level adjustment on these carbs is quite sensitive and very
time consuming to set.
Once done though, these carbs are quite reliable and need very little,
if any adjustment. If you have to constantly adjust these things, there
is another problem that needs to be addressed.

Weber spec's the float levels at 3.5 lbs of fuel pressure. We use a
low-pressure Holley regulator and fuel filters capable of removing water
as well as dirt, down to .4 micron. We have had very good luck with the
Racor #110 fuel filter/water separator. This removes 99% of dissolved
water and flows 35 GPH.

Dirt is the enemy of any carburetor, expecially Webers. Anyone who has
experienced the plugged idle jet phenomenon know what this fun is like.
Proper air and fuel filtering makes Webers VERY reliable and
trouble-free.
