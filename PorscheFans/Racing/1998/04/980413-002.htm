As Josh said, R1s will work perfectly in that configuration, not sure about
brand K but should be fine. Call Kumho, (C.U.T.) they will know the
recommended rim widths.

Yes that seems to be generally true.

They will be squeezed a bit but I would not worry about it.
Even before the current R1 people were running that size
on older BFG, Yokos, etc
on stock 914s and going REALLY fast. Maybe it would be a bit faster
on a 6" or 7" rim but you should be OK. You could try running
a few PSI higher that normal to keep the tire in shape.
