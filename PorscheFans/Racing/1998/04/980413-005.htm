Hey all,

About to go out and buy some stickies (Don't know if I'm going
Khumo, Scotty! Don't know if I want to be that cool yet).

Anyways Imy 74 has carrera flares and currently am running 205's
in the front and 245's in the rear. I would like to get the sizes
a bit closer, or just stuff more tire under there. I THINK my 16"
wheels are 7"fr and 8" rear but it could be 6"fr and 7"rear but
doubt it.. Will measure later. Anyways can someone give me some
ideas on how big people go with the carrera flares..

225 fronts  245-255 rear.

I know tire sizes really depend on the manuf. As a Hoosier 225 is
about as big as the 245 BFG (don't flame me, that is how it
appeared when I put them together)

Thanks for any insight..

Tory

Oh ya, Scotty if you kick down some used Khumos fir relatively
free so I can see if being cool is all that I won't have a problem
and your sponsor would appreciate another Khumo tire buyer/user

Remember the first  is one free then they get you hooked and you
then you have to buy them!!
