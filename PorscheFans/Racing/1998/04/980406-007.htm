Kieth - 

Like you, I wonder what parts of the rear of a 911 contribute to the
structure of the car, and what parts are just bodywork. The rear is
where removing weight pays large dividends. However, as to the
fenders it seems a fair guess that they don't contribute noticeably to the
car's general stiffness.  I've seen lots of cars with Dzus-on rear
fenders.  No support there.  

My '68 912 Targa race car has glass flares added well before she fell
into my hands.  They appear to have been rivited onto the steel about
half-way up from the wheel arch where the old "flares" were cut off. 
Some liberal  use of Bondo over the joint, maybe.  Have done very well,
considering.  No cracking at the joint.

So I conclude the fenders add neither to the vertical support of the
engine nor to preventing horizontal wracking of the engine's rectangular
space.  It looks like the inner fenderwell and edges of the rear deck lid
area may provide vertical support.  And the motor mounts serve as
gussets horizontally.  Maybe the fairly generous section of the rear box
longitudinals makes them strong enough to take all the loads by
themselves?  I haven't been willing to act on that thought, though.  I've
never noticed any structural analysis of the 911 unibody in any of the
ordinary literature.
