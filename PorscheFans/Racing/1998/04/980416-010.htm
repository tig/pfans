Hello Jim,

> more oversteer. Can we have it? Or must we walk some kind of a tightrope, 

You're a little confused :-). The goal of setting up a suspension is to
result in a car that has neutral handling. That is, it neither understeers
or oversteers. At the limits of tire adhesion, a well balanced car will
start to slide sideways, neither pushing off the track front first,
or spinning off the track rear first.

Typically, most cars are set up with understeer. That makes the car
easier to drive, and safer. When you enter a corner too fast, the car
will understeer, or go straight ahead. Ease up on the throttle, and
the car will start to turn. So, for the average person, an understeering
car is safe and easy to control.

For sports cars, understeer is not a good thing. It forces you to lift
off the throttle, and that costs you time on the track. A slight 
amount of oversteer is faster, as it allows you to stay on the throttle
and turn the car with either the steering wheel, or the accelerator.
However, it takes a lot more skill to control a car that oversteers.

What happens when you make modifications (if you are smart and do it in 
a series of steps) is that you move in the direction you are attempting
to go. For example, if your car's tendancy is to understeer, you would
make changes to reduce that tendancy. For example, you could mount a larger
rear sway bar. That would reduce the understeer. If the swaybar you pick
is too large, you will move right from understeer to oversteer. However,
if you pick the right sized bar (or pick an adjustable bar), you can
adjust the handling just the way you want, you can remove almost all the
understeer, leaving just enough to keep the car easy to drive. Generally,
if you want to improve the handling, you change the end that isn't working
the way you want. So, if you car understeers (not enough grip at the
front) you would want to make the front grip more, not the rear grip
less. Bigger front tires, stiffer rear bar (that will transfer more
weight to the front tires when cornering), stiffer rear shocks, wider
front track, and some of other changes would work. You wouldn't want to
install smaller rear tires because that would reduce the rear grip.

Of course, it's never that simple. You might find a car that understeers
at corner entry, but oversteers at corner exit. Changing the suspension
of that car to be neutral would be very difficult (at least for me).

Hope this helps,
