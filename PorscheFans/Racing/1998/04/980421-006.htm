Joe:  IMHO you were totally outta line in your response to Scottys comments
about his experience with your products.  I've been on this list and its
predecessor for several years and this is the worst example of an
unwarranted personal attack I've ever seen....At the very least, you owe
Scotty an apology.....in stronger terms, I'd be happy to see you dumped from
the list. I hold several competition licenses including FIA, PCA and Vintage
licenses and race a variety of cars including a couple of Porsches.  I will
never buy any of your products and when I buy another Porsche whether a
track or street car, I will remove any of your products it may have
installed.  I will also activly campaign against you and your products when
at PCA races and club events. I hope I've stated my feelings strongly
enough.  

Good bye and good riddance,

Ted Smith
