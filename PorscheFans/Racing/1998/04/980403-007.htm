I understand your though process however good luck finding a driving shoe
that isn't primarily (suede)leather.  If you check the current Simpson
catalog you will notice all five of their SFI & FIA approved driving shoes
only have Nomex fleece linings and the remainder of the shoe, except the
sole, is leather.

The ProEuro, Sparco, Stand21, OMP are all the same.  Even the SFI and FIA
approved racing gloves are at least half leather.

Just thought you might like to know...
