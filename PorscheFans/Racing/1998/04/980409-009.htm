Jeff:

I run -1.5 deg front and -2.5 deg rear camber; zero toe front and -15'
toe-in
rear.  My car is used similarly and I haven't seen any increased inside
tire
wear with the more aggressive camber and the car handles a whole lot
better in the turns.  FYI, I also have stiffer t-bars, R1s and bigger 
swaybars.

Hope this helps,
