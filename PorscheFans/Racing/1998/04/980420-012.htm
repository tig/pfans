   Hey joe, our point was exactly what you said. You repost *PRIVATE* mail
sent to you so you can solicit your wears. It becomes a little tiresome
especialy knowing what an opportunist you are (only show in town? double the
price, right?) and the quality of the product you sell along with all the
B&B bashing it is a little annoying and that was the point of the first post. 

I do not post blatant advertisements that are unsolicited
>> and/or are not for general information purposes. 

   Your posts that I have seen are completely unsolicited *publicly*.

Hey, at any event I am

   And that is great! We need more guys makin doo daas for the sport and
supporting the sport, kudos to you!

   Gee joe, I didn't realize I had made a personal attack, all I did was
state facts about your product and it's price structure (or lack thereof
;-)) But I wanna publicly apoligise for gettin you so wound up. I never
intended to get you so excited as to provoke such a response. I am somewhat
overweight I guess for my height (250lb 6'2") but I don't often get called
*fat*, maybe that has something to do with the way I carry my 250lb ;-) My
email address refers to the fact that I often pilot a ZR-1 Corvette and as
you might not know they are some 4" wider than the base Corvettes. They used
to be classed in ASP for SCCA Solo2 competetion and my email address was a
little stab at SCCA while campaigning to get the cars reclassed. But I still
drive a ZR-1 now and then and will be driving a ZR-1 for *PIRATE RACING*
(see *www.zr1.net/ZR1_pirate.html*) in the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge
series car #75, maybe you could stop by and visit us at Lime Rock? :-)

>> 		1. lose the ZR1 tail on the end of your messages. Its childish and 	
>redundant. Other P-Fans agree.

   Thanx for setting me straight on my childish sig. I sure wouldn't wanna
take up precious bandwidth that you could be using to sell mufflers ;-)  LOL!!

>> 		2. I heard about your 993 that you wrecked on the track and converted

>> everyone at THUNDERHILL and Sear Point?

   Gotta set you a little straighter her joe. The car weighs approx 3100lb
not 2100lb (i wish) and it has a totaly stock 3.6L varioram with a motor
sound airbox lid and a TRIAD exhaust system which works and looks very nice
at a much lower cost than your system. I am sooooo flattered that you had
heard about me and that someone thought I was soooo fast that they told you
I had a 2100lb 3.8L car but it just aint so joe ;-) I did drive the car at
Sears and Thunderhill and will be at Vegas weekend after next and again will
be driving myself. The car runs class C and does very nicely. As for
*wrecking* this car, well, uhhhh, I wouldn't exactly say one fender tap
about the size of a football was wrecking the car but hey, whatever ;-) The
car did get a little stronger tap in the front when it was new before I
owned it but it has a clean title as it was not hurt that bad.

   Well thanx for the suggestion joe but since a set that was $950 new and
sold for $400 after being used for 2 hours I guess that since I have to work
every day for a living I cannot afford that kind of depreciation, hell, by
tomorrow I will have to pay for owning them ;-)

   Wow joe, I am gettin the impression you aren't very fond of Chevrolets
huh?? C'mon joe, tell us how ya really feel ;-)

   Thanx for writin joe, hope to see ya the track sometime.

Giddyuuuup!!
