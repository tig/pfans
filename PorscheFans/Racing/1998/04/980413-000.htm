You have several options.  Every one is slow and tedious!  I have used
all and I'll list them in the Best to Worst order:

Best - Freeze and Crack.  This material will crack and break apart if
frozen.  You can just keep the heat off in the garage (here in the
northeast, anyway).  Smack the stuff with a small ball peen hammer and
it will shatter.  Vacuum up the pieces and use cold chisels and paint
scrapers (gasket scrapers work very well) to get it all out. 

Okay but Messy - Heat 'n Scrape.  Use a torch to heat the TOOL (not the
material directly!) and then remove with heated tool.  Works VERY well,
but be sure to have good ventilation.  Setting up a fan behind you
blowing away from you works well.

Okay - Scrape it out. Use cold chisels and paint scrapers to remove the
material.  The gasket scraper and hammer method can get do a nice job.

DO NOT TRY - Chemical Method - Paint Removers, etc have very little
effect on this stuff (I know) and just cause you health problems.

To finish off the removal use a modest amount of chemical (Wurth Cleans
All is excellent) solvent with a rag and the aforementioned enhanced
ventilation.  Using a wire wheel on a strong drill can work wonders
also.  Feel free to combine the methods as required.

Have Fun!
