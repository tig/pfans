   I have to agree with ya here! I am sooooo sick of hearing how some guy was soooooo fast after he spent $550 or $650 or $850 or $950 for two glass packs for his 993. I have in my posession a set of fabspeed muffs for a 993 that I bought used with 2 hours on them and the finish is ugly as hell. I called three times and taslked to Joe about buying a set before I obtained these, but the price went up each time I talked to him starting around $500 to a final of nearly $1000 in a years time. 

   I finaly decided to work with Dave Said at TRIAD in Olympia Wa. to develop some lightweight mufflers and they are awsome. The car went to Thunderhill and then Sears Point and was the fastest car all weekend both times. Dave's exhaust is wonderful but I do not think it was the sole reason the car kicked ass. The beauty is that the exhaust is about 1/2 of what Fabspeed gets and you won't have to listen to Dave pitching you every week ;-)

   PS, the *new 2 hour old* fabspeed muffs are for sale for what I paid and very close to what they are worth.....$400 plus shipping.

Lemmy no,
