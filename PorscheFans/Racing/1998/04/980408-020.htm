Please HELP ME!!!! I am completely frustrated after spending 4 hours in the
garage this evening attempting to set the ride height of my 73 911 RS clone.
The car has the standard 911S suspension..... I followed the Haynes manual and
raised the car and leveled it prior to adjusting. After setting the radius
arms to 37 degrees - as stated in the manual and the Spec booklet - I
struggled to get everything hooked back up and lowered the car back down. To
my horror the car is WAY too high in the rear. I am getting a measurement of
27 inches from the ground to the wheel well lip - considerably higher than hat
Bruce A. recommends. If anyone out there can give advice on what I may have
done wrong or an easier way to set the torsion bars I would gladly appreciate
it. After a LONG winter I am anxious to feel the pleasures once again of
piloting my Porsche!!!!!!!
