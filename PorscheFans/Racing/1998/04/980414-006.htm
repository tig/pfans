I got a copy of the PCA Club Racing rules from the national office just to
see what the requirements are and what the classification scheme looks
like, even though I am nowhere near ready to drive at that level and
probably won't ever be able to afford it anyway.  d:-)

Looking at the Stock class rules, it says wheels 1" wider than OE are
allowed.  I believe my '66 911 had 4.5" x 15" wheels originally, so are
5.5" the max for remaining in stock class?  Also, under tires sizes, it
says 195/50 and 205/50 are not allowed in any stock class.  Is that because
of the lower OA wheel diameter providing lower effective gearing? Just
before that it says any profile over 185/35 is OK.  I don't get it.  Why
the specific exclusions?

My car has a '67S 2-liter motor in it, so it appears that it would run in G
stock as an updated car, as long as I met the other specs for a '67S.
However, a PO installed the small flares from '69-73 on this car, and it
appears that flares are only allowed on Prepared cars.  Does that mean it
would move up ANOTHER class unless I put original fenders back on it?

It may be premature to be thinking about it, but I'm just curious.
Thanks,
.
