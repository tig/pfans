Having just completed this agonizing project on a 944, here is my suggestion:

Get a good heat gun and start on the tar pads located on the floor in front of
the seats.  These pads are very heavy (tar pads=50lbs on a 88,951).  Get the
tar pads warm, and then use a good, heavy duty paint scraper to remove the
pads.  This works pretty well.  I used a Snap-On gasket scraper on the smaller
sections. 

This will leave you with the floor looking like someone ate too much
chocolate, got sick, and tried to wipe their...never mind, you get the idea.
The tar residue is the issue.  I tried lots of different solvents.  I did not
want to remove the underlying paint and go to bare metal.  

Now no flames on this next bit, but gasoline worked the best.  It did not
remove the paint, dissolved the tar residue quite easily, and was cheaper and
worked better than anything else I tried.  I used a parts cleaning brush and
an old tee shirt to do the final cleanup. 

Remember to use the heat gun first, then roll the car outside, unplug and put
the heat gun back in the garage before you start with the gasoline.  I would
never suggest using gasoline as a cleaner, but this method worked better than
anything else I tried.   

This process worked great on the carpet foam (944/951) as well. 

Have fun and no smoking!
