Greetings from down under folks,

I was wondering whether any of you folk have had experience using 30mm =
hollow front and 20mm solid 3 way adjustable sway bars on a 951 or =
944S2. I am wary of Alwin Springer's note from Porsche Motorsport NA =
discussing the Porsche competition A arms. I have included the relevant =
part below.=20

<<<Neither set of arms noted above pose a problem, as long as:

1.The ride height is not lowered beyond the point which causes binding =
of the ball joint when the suspension reaches full travel,=20
2.The front sway bar is not greater than the M030 package sway bar in =
either 0.D. or wall thickness,=20
3.The lower bore in the strut is not worn out and 4) the parts are =
assembled following the steps outlined in the Porsche Service Manual. =
(Despite the fact that this may be slightly contrary to the Service =
Manual, it is imperative that the bolt and nut (original Porsche Parts) =
be replaced each time they are removed. >>>

I do have an uprated spring set up (250lb - 500lb) in the front so I am =
figuring that this would help balance the additional strength placed on =
the 'A' arm by the stiffer bar.

All experience and advice would be appreciated.
