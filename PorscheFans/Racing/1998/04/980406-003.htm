A bigger rear bar should fix this problem.  My '72 911T had the normal
understeer with both the Porsche 15mm it came with and an 18mm that I
believe was available for a '72 or '73 911S.  Anyway, that wasn't enough
to cure the problem, but upgrading to a Charlie Bar (1 5/8" I think) has
virtually eliminated understeer (when used with a good set of tires) but
hasn't IMHO made the car too twitchy near the ragged edge.  Of all the
suspension upgrades I've done to the car (wider wheels, torsion bars,
increased camber, adding front & rear spoilers), this one was the most
noticable in terms of feel of the car and lap time improvements.
