Hey all,

I know this is mostly a forum for race questions but I have
thought about this and really think you can help with it..

I am in the process of upgrading my suspension with Weltmeister
racing bushings. I planned on doing the rear banana arm bushings.
I just received an Email stating that some racers had trouble with
the racing bushings, causing weird rear end performance and
falling to pieces. To fix this they reverted back to the factory
bushings. Can someone shed some light on this? I trust the person
I got the formentioned info from but am the type that likes to get
a few opinions before I make my decision..

Thanks as always
