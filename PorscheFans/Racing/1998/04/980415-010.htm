It has been brought to my attention that my fuel pressure and not the Webers
many be the cause of all the smoke (spent fuel, not oil) coming out of my
exhaust.  I have a 76 911S with a 3.2 and 46 IDA Webers.  The car runs great
but I would like to reduce the amount of smoke exiting the rear of the car
during hard acceleration.  My fuel pressure is currently 7 lbs. and I've
been told webers should run at about 3lbs.  If this is the case how do I
reduce the fuel pressure?  I've been told to first reduce the fuel pressure
before reducing the idle jet size.  Can anyone help me with this?

P.S. I would like to thank everyone for all the info on where to get Weber
parts and  advise.

Thanks,
Dan Drabick
