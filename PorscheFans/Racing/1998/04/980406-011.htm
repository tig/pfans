Chuck:    Good to hear from you!   

My experience was with the Crane XR-700, photo-optical triggered ignition
system.  This goes back to my very first Porsche (73 911S), and "Golly gee
whillakers", did it give me some migraines!   I don't know which system you
have, but here is a quick list of some of the "voodoo curses" that I
encountered:

1)  When I shut off the car, (about 30-seconds later) and would casually walk
into a gas station, convenience store, etc., the system would discharge.
"Holy shit and run for cover, I think I've been shot!!",   No kiddin'...   an
"Earth shattering kaaabboooom!", and a 5-foot flame would blast out of the
exhaust.  I think one of the store clerks thought it was a robbery. (I am in
Michigan-Detroit is aka "Murder City")  So, I played it off like I was looking
for where the noise came from too.  Needless to say, I was very embarrassed
and the American car lovers loved to give  me a whole rash of grief.

2)  Despite the problems described above, I had a horrible problem with
intermittent missing and no spark.  But, I had some great adventures:  Let's
see...I got stranded on a 2-lane bridge and backed up traffic for about 3-4
miles,  got to know  Joe (the wrecker driver) on a first name basis,  AAA
cancelled my roadservice,  and my fiance absolutely and positively refused to
ride in the car ( I think that was the worst, it kind of hurt my manhood ,ha,
ha.)   Seriously, the thing wreaked havoc on my nerves.   I called Crane about
a dozen times, and they offered about a dozen "solutions", but all to no
avail.  

3)    This is my theory:  The problem seemed to stem from the vibration and
heat generated by my Porsche.   The optical trigger wheels, which are made
from thin plastic,  expanded  with the increased centrifugal force induced by
the higher revoultions of the 911S engine.  Most engines don't redline at
7200RPM (yes, I drove it hard) and the plastic trigger wheels are merely
pushed down over the distributor shaft with slight pressure.  When they
expanded, it would cause a slight shift on the distributor axis and would
cause a miss, just as if the points did not open.  Also,  the mounting bracket
for the photo diodes is a bit flimsy, made out of thin sheet metal.  Perhaps,
if they designed a cast or rigid bracket which was not so susceptible to
vibration they may work better.  When the engine speed reached moderate
levels, the angle of the slots in the trigger wheels became distorted and
where intermittently interrupted by the vibration of the optical mounting
bracket.   This gave the same effect as having loose or burnt ignition points.
I will not even mention the problems I encountered on rainy days, I think
anyone with any mechanical ability can figure that one out.   Finally, Crane
conceded that it (XR-700) would not work with my application and upgrade my
system to the HI-6 which worked great.

I hope I haven't painted too dim of a picture for you, but that is the truth
as I experienced it.   If you have problems after you install the system,
immediately contact the manufacturer and inform them of your woes.   I
personally like the HI-6, which uses the points as a microswitch.  The points
are only used as a switch to open and close a logic circuit in the ECU.   This
is a very, very small amount of current and the points last virtually forever.
Also, you do not need to set or readjust the dwell, as with the HI-6 there is
no need to do so.

If you need more info, or would need some help, feel free to e-mail me...I
would be glad to help!

Good Luck!
