That's a good point that I forgot about.

Right.

I believe this asterisk was added because a standard '74S and '74 Carrera
are the same car except the rear flares and bigger wheels
on the Carrera.

The '74 and '75 Carerra definately had 7 and 8 by
15" rims available, although only late in '74. the early '74 factory
manual does not list them but the late '74 does. I found out
by a protest in SCCA Solo-II in '91.

Anyway, if you force the '74 Carrera to run as "stock" in G then
nobody would run them as a Carrera, but would say it was a '74 S
that they flared and ran 2" bigger than stock 6" wheels. This
would also allow other prepared mods such as brakes etc.
So you might as well allow the Carrera to use prepared mods
as there is really no difference between a "prepared" 2.7S
and a Carrera. I do wonder about the wheel size however, as
theoretically you could run 9 and 10 as a prepared Carrera.
Maybe this asterisk should be clarified a bit unless these huge
wheels and other prepared mods are meant to be allowed.
 
I hope this makes some sense, I have always enjoyed
car classification and mods and working within (around?)
the rules.
