Hello,

Well, I don't like to air dirty laundry in public, but since you asked...

I believe BFG has a serious problem with quality control. I bought
a set of R1's at Pocono for the August Club race. To make a long story
short, 1 tire was corded after less than 150 track miles. The other
3 tires were fine, and I put about 600 miles on them before they 
corded. I've seen the same thing happen to others. A friend of mine
bought 4 R1's. He ran 1 day IN THE RAIN at Bridgehampton. When we
were checking the car before the next day, we discovered a spot,
about the size of a quarter, where all the rubber was missing. The
cord was exposed, and the tire was not safe to drive on. I've heard
of similar experiences from others.

Now, I realize no one is perfect, and sometimes bad tires can get
sold.  I called Dave Sanders (director of the BFG Team T/A program) to
talk to him about my situation. After being repeatedly told he would
call me back (he never did), I gave up and wrote a nice letter to him.
I explained what had happened, including my pyrometer readings,
pressure readings, lap times, and pictures of all the tires. I didn't
even ask for a free tire. I told him that since I normally get 8-10
days from a tire, I would like to get a replacement tire for 1/4 the
price (the tire lasted 2 days instead of 8, so I used 1/4 the tire). He
sent me a response that basically said it was my fault the tire wore 
out in 150 miles, and too bad on me.

So I have decided that I will no longer use BFG tires. There are a
number of other manufacturers of DOT legal competition tires. I'll
give my money to a company that either has better quality control,
or a more customer friendly attitude.

Some additional info:
I'm a Team T/A member, and I had been using BFG R1 tires for the last
few years, and I had been mainly happy with them. Like many people, I
have a fairly limited budget for my track events. I need a set of tires
that is both sticky, and lasts relatively long. Basically, I need to
get 7-10 track days from a set of tires. I've gotten 10 days from R1's,
and about the same from Yoko A008 RS. Yoko stopped making the RS, so I
went back to BFG. I believe I know what I'm doing as far as car setup.
I run the tires at the appropriate pressure. I measure tire temps,
pressures, I know what my camber is, etc.

I just feel BFG has a quality control problem, and when a customer
gets bad tire, BFG doesn't seem to care.
