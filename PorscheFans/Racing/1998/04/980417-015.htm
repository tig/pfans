PFans-

The recent thread on twin pluging 911s and HP increase prompted my response.

At the risk of offending the "most hated man on the Internet," I must disagree
with Steven Timmons (he might be hated, but I like him anyway).  I may have
missed some of the messages or not have gotten the full picture, but I must
say that just  twin plugging ANY 911 engine WILL increase the HP.  Perhaps in
a perfect world the twin plug option would not increase the HP, but my
understanding of the 911 combustion chamber is that it is less than perfect.
Meaning; when the spark in a single plug system ignites, the burn/combustion
is uneven and incomplete (unless you have a near perfect design and
combination of piston face and head to allow swirling and even, complete
burn).  When a twin plug system fires, it burns the fuel mixture more evenly,
more quickly, and more thoroughly.  Now, a quciker, evener, more thorough
combustion is definetly going to give an increase in HP.  So, if the only
thing changed in the motor is the the plug system from single plug to dual
plug, I maintain that there will be an increase in HP.  I also maintain that
the HP increase from twin plugging, by itself, is not worth the expense (and
may not be noticeable to the seat of the pants unless you carry your wallet in
your back pocket then you will fell a difference in the form of less money to
hinder your feel of the road!). 

BTW, I fully agree with Steve's position re twin plugging and increasing
compression and the obvious resultant HP gain.  

Any contrary or supporting postition is welcome.
