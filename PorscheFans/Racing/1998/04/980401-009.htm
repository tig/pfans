Hi Josh,

My name is Brian Keyes and I have a silver 1985 MR2 that I solo trial with.  I have seen your nice 914 and thought you might be interested in this.  I was out with a friend this afternoon and saw a beautiful 1973 2.0 914 at the Stevinson West dealership.  The car is being sold on consignment and the interesting part is that it has had a huge amount of restoration work done to it.  There is a printed sheet that lists all of the modifications and the dealer said the guy has about $20k in it.  It is nice straight, beautiful white paint, no rust, new interior, rebuilt trans and engine, suspension upgrages, Fuchs alloys, etc.  Apparently the guy was going to convert it to a 6 cylinder car and never finished.  They were willing to sell it to me for $6k but I am not really in the market for a 914.  In fact I am close to buying a friends (original owner) 944.  In any case, this may be worth a look for you or someone you know.

regards,
Brian Keyes
