Hello Greg:

I will try to answer your questions, regarding Webers, to the best of my
ability.

1) MFI vs Webers:

The MFI is a good system when it is in good shape and working properly.
Unfortuneatly, when it acts up it is very time consuming, a real pain in the
ass to repair, and very expensive.   A lot of racers (with deep pockets) who
are skilled, or employ skilled mechanics use the MFI and swear by them.
However, in my OPINION, they are a bit too quarkey and expensive ... I'll
explain as follows:  A)  They require too many specialized tools and equipment
to service them.   To set them up properly, you will need protractors,
micrometers,  dial calipers, and many other expensive precision instuments.
this is very time consuming.   The local Porsche dealer charges about 40 hours
(at $70 p/hour) to recondition the MFI sytems.  In addition, they should be
sent to a qualified specialty shop to be bench flowed and tested.   This is
very expensive, somewhere in the neighborhood of $1200.  Even alot of the
Porsche dealers sub them out for repair.   Recently, I had a customer with a
2.2L 911S with the MFI system and it was running extremely  rich.   I checked
out the basics,  such as the injection timing  on the camshaft and the heater
hose from the left heat exchanger to the thermostat housing....all checked out
OK.  Then, after  following the procedures oulined in the factory manuals (a
very lengthy process), I concluded that the MFI thermostat needed to be
replaced.   I double checked my findings with the local Porsche dealer, and
was stunned at the cost of the replacement parts....that is if they could get
them.   The total repair with parts would have exceeded $3100.    So,  my
opinion is that when the MFI comes into question and needs overhauled, it is a
good time to switch the system over to Webers.

2)   Webers:  Pros & Cons

Like the MFI, the Webers are a good system when they are in good condition and
operating properly.   However, they require a lot of maintenance.   A friend
of mine had them on a Ferrari 308, and had the car at the dealer more thatn he
drove it.   One advantage is that they are relatively simple and inexpensive
to repair.   The cost to switch your MFI system over to Webers is about $1900.
(Give or take a few bucks)   The set-up of the Webers also requires a few
specialty tools, such as:  a float level gauge, carb synchronizer (2  of them
is ideal), and a lot of patience.   Beware of buying used Webers. Some of them
are nearly impossible to get right when they are worn, and still will not
set-up and run correctly after a rebuild.  I experienced this first hand on a
74 911S.  I tried jetting, jetting, and rejetting.   Finally, as with the MFI
systems, I contacted the local Porsche dealer's mechanic for some tips.  His
advice was to buy new Webers, as he had experienced this same problem in the
past.   Another advantage is that they can be changed and fine tuned to obtain
higher power levels.   If you look in the PCA parade rules for autocrossing,
you will see that installing  Webers is considered a   horspower modification,
and can bump you into a higher class.  If you go to a track event, you will
see more Webers on race Porsches than you will MFI.   As previously mentioned,
the main disadvantage is that you will have spend alot of time farting around
with them to keep them in tune.  Also, keep in mind, that installing Webers
will most likely require you to install hotter spark plugs (I used WR7DP) and
a high performance ignition system (I used an HI-6000, with a PS-91 coil).

3)   Fuel Economy:

I really do not remember what my fuel economy was with the MFI or the Webers.
What I do remember was that it wasn't that great.   This was due in part to my
driving habits.  I  drove the car pretty hard, as loved to hear that GP sound
at the higher RPMs.   However, if fuel economy is a concern, the Webers can
(usually) be rejetted with smaller mains to decrease fuel consumption.   On
the other hand, the MFI system is not real user friendly for adjustments.

I hope this info helps you out.  If you need more info you can e-mail me.

Good Luck!!
