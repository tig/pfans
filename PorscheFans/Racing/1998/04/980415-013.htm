If purchased in the fall, you must have the R3S02 tires which I run 42 psi
front and 44 psi rear (hot off the track). Depending on your suspension they
can also handle lots of negative camber. The new R3S03 tires have a very
different construction so that they can be run at much lower pressures (~10
psi lower) reportedly because too much of the "DOT tire racing community"
(i.e. BFG R-1 types) couldn't handle the idea of running such high pressures
so were continually running too low a pressure subsequently destroying the
tires prematurely and blaming it on Hoosier. Hoosier evidently got fed up and
changed.  I expect the stiffer belt construction will make the Hoosiers hold
up better in high acceleration and deceleration forces (as in the heavier and
hi-torque cars) which many of us believe was a weakness. We'll see how well
the new ones do and what pressures actually end up being the best for our
individual applications. I hope to get some feedback ASAP as I start using the
new ones next week at Phoenix Int'l Raceway.

 Must confess to not knowing what they are. I took delivery at IRP this fall,
 so are they the new or the old?
 
 My exper is lots of pressure is needed. Camber etc... do not know but would
 like to know, if you would be kind enough to share insights?
