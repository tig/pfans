I'm looking at a 76 S coupe.The car has a glass slant nose,AIR w/ lighting in
front bumper,glass 1/4s ,9'' &11'' flares,fuchs 7/9 x 16 and C-2 T-bo reps w/
new Pzeros.Factory t-bo tail . Rebuilt engine w/ updates and rebuilt trans. No
rust and no mechanical work to speak of is needed. The interior is decent and
the car needs paint. The guy claims he added 20-25 hp with some head work and
higher comp pistons.     It still has the CIS . What kind of pistons /head
work could yield this kind of increase while retaining the CIS?  In Bruces
book he details an RS set-up but I doubt this is the case. I have not grilled
the owner of the car yet ,he was'nt around when I spotted the car. I want to
know if a lightened 2.7  car will stay up with the 3.0 cars,I want this car
for the track and I want at least as much "GO" as my 79SC.It all boils down to
this: If I lighten this car , and go out to run with the SCs and an occasional
3.2,will I be left in the dust or will it come down to driver skill??By the
way ,he wants around $6k for the car,good deal?     Any opinions will be
appreciated!!
