Hi Keith:

Here is our 2 cents here. There are many good opinions about all this but our advice is based on
lots of experience. :^)

Keep the stock rev-limiter unless you use different rod bolts or better rods. I might also
consider using Aase valve springs, just for a measure of over-rev insurance in this application.5R
case?. Personally, I'm unfamiliar with that one. We always try to use a 7R case. This is by far,
the strongest most rigid of the Mg cases. You can use the 4R safely with a 2.2,  we prefer the 7R
for 2.4 and larger engines.

> Time-Certs, are they necessary on a solid 2.4?
>

Absolutely!!. We consider them imperative for any Mg case engine.

> Oil-Bypass mod, do you have to change to an updated oil pump.
>

The oil bypass modification must be done if you use a larger oil pump such as an SC or Carrera
pump. On your stock 2.4, I wouldn't worry so much unless you update the oil pump.

> J&E Pistons, Do they fit with stock clearance or run loose for expansion.
> Any experiences?
>

We run the JE's at the same clearance as the Mahle's with no problems. They are excellent quality
items, and for performance use, much easier on the rods due to their lighter pins and piston
weights. The American rings also seem to reduce oil consumption somewhat better than the Mahle's.

> Dose the S cam make power past 7,300 RPM with the right muffler & air
> cleaner?

The "S" cam will rev beyond 7300, but it is beyond its power peak no matter which muffler you use.
Installing a good racing exhaust system will prevent the power curve from falling as fast. :^)

> Any other mods for power or reliability?
>

There are lots and lots of thing to do that will help. Compression increases, twin-ignition,
cylinder head flow work, a good header and muffler system, performance coatings, these things are
just the beginning.

Sure sounds like a fun project. Not too much of this is inexpensive. I hope this helps a little.
