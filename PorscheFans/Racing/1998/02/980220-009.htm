 	In 1997 Rafael using my SUPERCUP system  won PCA events at Road Atlanta,
 Road America, Pocono, and Roebling Road. He achieved 2nd places at Lime
 Rock and Summit Point. I received a 2nd at Pocono and customers Dave
 Montrois and Dennis O'keefe from Florida consistently finished in the top 5
 were they competed. Also Rafael was dominating and leading the Indianapolis
 Raceway Park race but received a black flag and was forced to pit. If he
 was given a simple "Stop and Go" he claims he was so far out in front he
 could have continued to win.  >>

Let me get this right; "He would have won at IRP if he hadn't gotten black
flagged (and the reason he was flagged was for passing under yellow as I
recall, which may explain why he was so far out front), and he would hve
placed highly at Sebring if he hadn't 13/13'd out before the race ever
started".  
Would appear obeying the rules would help more than lame excuses....

Jon Lowe
6 races, 6 wins in last 12 months; no DNF's, no DNS's, no black flags, no
13/13's.
