Is there anyone within an hour or two of Ann Arbor, MI, who could have a
look at my 914 and give me a (relatively) definitive answer on what PCA
club racing class I'll run in? I'll bring you the car and dinner.

I'm planning on going to the rookie school and the race at Mid-Ohio in
May. My car was not built to any class-based rules so I'm going to be
bumped up a class as "prepared" in the stock groups, at the very least
(for carbs). 

Now I'm worried I might actually be put in GT, which would be utterly
nuts, given my driving skills and vehicle. 

I know I won't be competitive, so as long as I stay in the H, I, J class
vicinity I should have someone to run with, which is all I'm hoping for.
Running with the GT folks would be a nightmare on wheels. Talk about
deerlighting.

The car is a '73 914 2.0. My goal is just to get out there; No call from
Penske on Monday expected.

I've been DTFR (close relative to RTFM--Deciphering The F-ing Rules),
but I sure would like some experienced help. The club racers I know
around here are mostly 944 TurboS guys.

TIA.
