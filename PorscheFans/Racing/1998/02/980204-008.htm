Soon to be fellow Club Racers,

I am getting serious now about going Club Racing and wanted to get some
advice on additional oil cooling for my 1974, Stock 2.7, CIS Carrera
that I am evolving into the Club Racer it was meant to be.

Currently I have the factory loop cooler under the fender but I feel and
have been told that I probably will need additional cooling. At drivers
Ed events I have seen temperature creep up to around 240 at the end of
my 20 minute session.

Any idea on how much improvement I might see if I change out to the
factory radiator type cooler, ala 3.2 Carrera. This would be the easiest
option.

AJUSA advertises an "extra capacity" radiator type cooler that fits
under the fender. Its more expensive than a factory cooler but still
less than a front cooler and would not require a new valance. 

Any experience out there with the AJUSA cooler? (efficiency,quality,
fit, etc)

Do I need to protect the radiator cooler from rocks by putting some type
of a screen or shield over it ?

Am I wasting my time fooling with the under the fender cooler ? Do I
need to just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy the front cooler and a
new valance ?

Any help in this are would be greatly appreciated, hopefully I can get
some good advice and save some time, money, and my engine...

Thanks
Joe Wilkinson
