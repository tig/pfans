If Energy Suspension offers polyurethane bushings for Porsches, you
guys may want to consider those over the Weltmeister for a street/track
car.  I had them make up a full kit for my last car including subframe,
control arm and anti-roll bar bushings.  I have nothing but good things
to say, no noises, no wear, they were perfect.  You begin to hate 
expansion beams after installing them, but the car was quicker at
the track.

The best Energy bushings available are the black ones, apparently
they are graphite impregnated and didn't require any lubrication at
all, just the initial installation grease or whatever it is they
send with the package.

The whole kit was C$220.
