Dan, the strut and spindle are all one piece. You probably know this by now.

I have removed the top nut and pulled the shock down.  I took

The Bilstein is a inverted insert, the shock shaft actually goes downward
and is held to the bottom of the strut housing with a pin.

Get someone with small hands/arms. Removing the airbox should give you some
more room.

You'll probably find that rebuilding these units will not be much less
expensive that getting new units. Especially when you factor in shipping.
