Sure.

Driver Ed: 
	Cost $0.

Well, you do need a helmet, so $200-$300 for an SA 95 lid if you can't
borrow one.  Other than that, as long as your brakes, tires, suspension, 
and seatbelts are OK, go for it. After you've been signed off and don't
need an instructor, and want to make some improvements to the car, then
you can start adding 'goodies.'

PCA Racing:
	Need roll bar, 5 point harness, window net, kill switch, driving 
suit, shoes and gloves. Should have roll cage and race seat.

Prices are anywhere from $1000-$5000 depending on what you buy and
who installs it.

SCCA Racing:
	I have no idea! I know you need a roll cage, but other
than that, I don't know.
