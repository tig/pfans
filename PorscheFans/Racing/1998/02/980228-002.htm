PTarga asked about the hot set up for autocrossing for an SC.  Although I do
not know the rules for SCCA Solo and would accordingly closely check them
(for instance,PCA Club Racing has certain rules about minimum tire diameter
and wheel width whcih limit you) I would go with 8 and 9x16's with Hoosier
205 or 225 upfront and 245's in the back.  17's don't allow you to get the
car low enough as if you go with wider 17's they increase the diameter of
the overall tire.  86 944 8's will fit in the front, even if the car is very
low but Hoosier's 225's wouldn't, unless you didn't have the car low enough
or else purchased a custom offset for the front.  Hoosier is now coming out
with 205's to fit the front of 911's and 944's in response to requests from
PCA Club Racers.
I'd worry about getting the car low first, get it balanced, and then see how
much tire you can stuff.  The problem will be in the left front wheel first
and also check the right rear for oil line clearance (mine are tied up out
of the way) Bruce
