 Now I'm worried I might actually be put in GT, which would be utterly
 nuts, given my driving skills and vehicle.

If you did anything to the engine other than carbs (cam, overbore,
porting/polishing, etc.), you'll likely end up in GT-5 street (assuming you
run street tires).  Based on the limited info given, you are at least in class
I.  Typical things that bump you to improved:  Wheels wider than 1" over stock
(over 6.5), electronic ignition in a 914, carbs, Euro models.  Things that
will bump you to GT:  engine mods other than carbs and electronic ignition,
wheels over 2"wider than stock, lighter than stock weight (2139 lbs for a
914), lightweight body panels other than bumpers and spoilers, gutted
interior, roll cage tied to suspension points, etc.

Now you know why we say, "read the rules, then build your car"  ;).
