Excellent post by Fabspeed.  I've only been trailering t0/from track 
events for 4 years, but I had one scary experience with trailer sway 
early on that was enough to teach me a lesson.  

I'd like to emphasize that you want the tow vehicle to weigh more than 
the trailer with car (including everything you load on the trailer and 
into the car).  Better count those spare tires, toolboxes, etc that are 
towed.

Second, the longer and wider the wheelbase of your tow vehicle, the 
better.  A fullsize truck of 3/4 ton is enough to tow an early 911 on an 
open trailer, and probably would tow a later heavier 911 in an enclosed 
trailer.  I'm not convinced that you need a 3/4 ton truck since a friend 
tows a similar setup (1970 911-approx 2250 lbs, I think) with a 1/2 ton 
Suburban, but he uses the anti-sway bars connecting the trailer to the 
Suburban.  These are not expensive (probably $150-200 installed), and 
are a great safety boost for stability.  I'd recommend staying away from 
a Grand Cherokee or anything with a wheelbase shorter than 128-130 
inches, unless you are going to seriously lighten your towed rig by 
buying an aluminum trailer and not putting much on it.  I don't have any 
experience with this short of a combined rig, so I can't say it would 
work well, just that it might. A friend drove a dually for the first 
time and said that the wider rear wheels made a tremendous difference.

I lust after enclosed trailers sometimes, and I believe my tow 
vehicle would do the job, but the price/windage/storage hassle factor 
has kept me on an open trailer for the time being.  Just remember that 
the windage and weight of an enclosed trailer will pose new challenges 
for your tow vehicle.

Good luck, and be safe.  Your towing vehicle sure isn't as safe in a 
crash as your race car is, and the brakes and maneuverability aren't as 
sufficient to avoid incidents either.

89 Ford 250 ext cab/ext wheelbase with 460 c.i. engine (4600 lbs, plus 
500-600 of gear and driver, which is about what it takes to exceed my 
73 RS Replica (2365 lbs + 1800 lbs 16 ft open trailer + spare tires = 
around 4400 lbs towed).
