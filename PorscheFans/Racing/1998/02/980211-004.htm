Ain't we funny critters?  When I bought my 77 911 I marveled that it had
nothing which needed greasing, not like my 49 Ford or various VWs, etc.
Then I added polyurethane bushings so car would handle better on track
(actually, the rubber rear spring plate bushings were worn out and
needed replacement) before they claimed to be lubricant impregnated, 
came in different hardnesses, etc.  So I put zerks on the front ones, and I
have the privilage of greasing my Porsche (though I don't do this often). 
Rear squeaked and I greased the outers.  Just for fun I put a zerk in the
left side torsion tube and filled the whole damn thing with grease. 
However, I am deaf in one ear so I can't tell where lots of noises come
from, and never rode around in the back seat area with a stethoscope
checking out whether the squeaks I still  have only come from the right,
ungreased, side.  Maybe I'll get energetic and zerk the that side also and
see if peace and quiet can once again reign.

On the track of course you don't notice squeaks.  I don't notice any ride
harshness in my race car either with coilovers and spherical bearings
for all suspension movement.  But lapping on the track is intense and you
simply don't notice these things.  Driving on the street, as John Brocko
pointed out, is another story.  Still, I still drive the '77 with its occasionaly
irritating squeaks regularly on the street (on real street tires - my
experience has been like John's - the R-1s make it ride like a truck putting
around town, although the 911 list had various testimonials from people
who use R-1s on the street all the time and love it).
