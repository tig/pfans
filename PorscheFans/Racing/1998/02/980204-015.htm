Hello everyone.

I'm a long time lurker, first time poster on this list and would like to
ask a few newbie questions.

The budget (and the wife) is about ready to allow me to take the plunge
into PCA racing and I need some advice.  Which platform is recommended for
the beginner?  I am considering the big 3:  914; 944 turbo; and, the 911
(normally aspirated).  I would like a car that is receptive to upgrades as
my skills improve and I'm ready to move on to the next level.  Would any of
these cars place any particular limits on this plan?  Would it be better
(ie more cost effective) to switch to a car that is already sorted to
compete at each level?  

If it matters, I have quite a bit of seat time in fwd cars in both
auto-xing and track events.  I have no rwd experience and no head-to-head
racing experience.  

One more question.  Is there a list of PCA car setup rules on the web?
I've looked on a number of PCA sights with no luck.  Thanks for the help.

Rich Taylor
