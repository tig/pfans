Drivers Ed is not racing, nor is it a timed event, so most insurance will
cover it unless it has an exclusion.

I had a 944  replaced after it Kissed the wall at Watkins Glen , by State
Farm, and they only raised my rate $30 a year for 3 years.

	Yes.  My husband and I are both covered in drivers' ed events by
Farmers
	Insurance Exchange, and they covered his claim last year when he
spun his
	94 NSX black/black in turn 8 at Sears Point and went into the tires.
Of
	course it was 100% driver's error. ;-)

	He was totally honest about what had happened, and had no difficulty
with
	Farmers whatsoever. They obligingly paid over $6k for moderate body
damage
	to his front passenger's quarter panel, bumper, and hood. The only
	aggravation was that they required the Acura dealer to install a
used
	bumper that was available. Some preexisting nicks were evident when
we
	picked up the car, and had to return it to have them refinish the
bumper
	again.  The car looks and drives new. 

	The insurance on his NSX has gone up only $10 a month, and they said
it
	will remain at that level for 3 years as long as he has no further
claims.
	It's still worth it. The only damage that remains is his pride. ;-)
