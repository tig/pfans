Mike,

I'm surprised Porsche lists the turbo geometry arms as an option as early as '73; 
wouldn't have thought these existed until at least '75...

The changeover from steel trailing arms to aluminum is a straight swap.  There are a 
couple of small differences, primarily the swaybar mounting points are different - a 
"pop-on" mount on the steel arms and a bolt-on arrangement on the aluminum.  Otherwise, 
it is a direct replacement.  The aluminum trailing arms are a great upgrade for earlier 
cars.

I wouldn't recommend the Turbo geomatry on a lightweight (earlier) car.  Welding in the 
new mounting plates can be dicey and makes it harder to tune the suspension if not done 
perfectly; and the Turbo geometry was really intended for heavier cars dealing with 
Turbo boost.
