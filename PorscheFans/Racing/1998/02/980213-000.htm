Looked where? PCA club racing has always been 1" more than stock.

Not, diameter is free in PCA club racing and SCCA CSP.

Sense? You obviously have not been competing long, there is no sense. 
I suggest getting copies of all the rulebooks. But it is almost impossible
to build a car that will be competitive in more than one event type,
as the rules between PCA (local, parade, and club racing are ALL different)
and SCCA (stock, SP, Prep, etc) are not very similar. 

The best you can do is what I did for
10 years, run to SCCA stock rules which are legal for PCA club racing
stock and parade stock
(even the tires will now be legal thanks to dropping the minumum
diameter rule - Hooray! Will club racing be next to drop it??) 
You can win a Parade with SCCA stock setup
(I won 2 fastest of any stock class)  but unless you have a 968 
M030, you won't be competitive in club racing in an SCCA stock Porsche.

Since your 914 is probably already too modified you are out of luck, 
and in SCCA the 914s are dogmeat in stock class anyway (classed
wrong IMHO).

>   Does anyone out there have a conclusive answer?

Yes, RTFMs. ;-)
