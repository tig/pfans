Paul, these are valid questions but they point out different mechanisms at
work.

Changing ride heights the same amount on both wheels of one axle does not bring
the springs or sway bars into play, to first order.  You are simply rotating
the car along a circle whose center is the opposite axle.  (For small angles of
lift.)

However, a different case is adding an off-center weight to the car.  Adding a
weight (driver for example) does not transfer weight *either*, but will add
weight in different amounts to each wheel if the driver is offset wrt. the
car's CG.  If your goal is equal corner weights with this driver in the car,
now you will need to transfer weight by *unequally* adjusting ride heights on
all 4 wheels.  By adjusting ride heights unequally, you're now bringing the
suspension's spring rates (from the springs or torsion bars and/or the sway
bars) into play, and those are on the order of 100-300 lbs/inch depending on
your suspension type, which might be the rates you're expecting.  (For example,
my 911's front torsion bar rates are close to 100 lbs/inch -- fully stock
suspension.)

This is also an example of an unequal change in ride height, and therefore does
transfer weight because the suspension spring elements are now differently (and
asymmetrically) loaded than before.

A real-life example.  I had adjusted my car's ride height last fall without
corner balancing, and had the ride heights *perfect* :-), so I was convinced I
had perfectly balanced weights too (this is before I read Puhn's book; see
below :-).  Then I dropped by one of our list's subscribers who has scales in
his garage and was amazed to find that one of my diagonals was 300 pounds
different from the other (a 55/45 split)!  I then figured out how much I needed
to "twist" the car, essentially, by adjusting one rear side up and one down,
and fronts opposite.  After this, the ride heights were exactly the same as
before, but the diagonal weight split was nearly perfect, about 49.5/50.5.  So
this is all weight transfer and no ride height change.  At least this serves to
show that weight transfer and ride height change are certainly related but are
*not the same*, and you can change one without affecting the other.

BTW, I highly second the suggestion to pick up a copy of Fred Puhn's _How To
Make Your Car Handle_.  Its focus is broad but he spends a good bit of space
developing the underlying theory (simplified but sufficient) with some
outstanding passages that for me at least had the light bulbs turning on. 
Getting a mental picture of weight transfer, and why the end of the car with
the stiffer suspension will generally hold the road less, is very well
explained.
