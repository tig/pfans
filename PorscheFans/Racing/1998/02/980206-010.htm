I have been running a 944 NA car in I stock.  I also have a vintage racer (9=
12) that I've run in J
stock.  The 944 is cheaper to run and there is more competition in the I cla=
ss....it's also a
gas to drive....a real finesse driver will have a ball with this car and par=
ts are
plentiful and cheap.....a well set up 944 will take you through a few season=
s and if you're
just starting out, a low hp car will is a better learning tool IMNHO, as you=
 have to DRIVE the
car fast thru the corners rather than just from corner to corner.......You d=
o not need
expensive Aarms, BTW......I'm probably putting mine on the market as I'm res=
toring a
Formula car(vintage) and have a GT2(no, not a 911) car in the works for Club=
 racing...if I
sell it I'll run the 912 this year.....This is a winners circle car, fresh, =
sorted and
turnkey and very nice....for $7500......lemme know if you're interested and =
whether
you are or not.....get a 944NA...you won't be sorry.....
