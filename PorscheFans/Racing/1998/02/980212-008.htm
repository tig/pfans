I put the front plastic bushings in their holders, held the holders in place
on the car, and figured out where a zerk could go and not interfere with
anything and still be accessible to a grease gun.  In the front this was
complicated mainly by the protective skid caps, which may need a big
hole drilled in them so the grease gun end can mate with the zerk.  Then I
drilled the holders and bushings, tapped the holders and inserted zerk,
and went to work with a Dremel making grooves on the insides of the
bushings.   The bushing holders on the steel steering crossmember may
not be removeable like the ones on the aluminum later ones, but you
could do it in situ or just take the crossmember off.

To get grease directly to the rear inner bushing I figure you'd have to use
a long drill bit through several layers of sheet metal and maybe something
thicker where the bushing resides, and insert a tube that ran from the
outside into the bushing, and weld the outer end of the tube to the
outermost sheet metal, and tap the tube for the zerk on its outer end. 
Would require having the spring plate off the car unless you were willing
to drill a bit into the hub and forego any distributing grooving and take
other risks associated.  However, if ever I take the spring plate off, I'd be
tempted to try.  

Damn squeaks.  Am I to understand that lubrication impregnated
"poly-graphite" bushings are just hype, and even the most modern still
squeak just as much as the ones I installed in 1986?  Quel horreur.
