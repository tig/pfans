<<<<i am thinking of adding a roll cage or roll bar to my 87 944, does
the use of
cage allow normal use of interior ie pass. seats still capable of
handling
passengers?
which manufacturer is best and how much should i be prepared to spend? 
thanks in advance for info>>>>

I have just evaluated the situation and here's what I have found.

The passenger seat is still totally usable. But if you get a cage make
sure that you pad the passenger side of the car, too. 

PCA club racing may require a roll cage starting next year.

Avoid roll cages or bars that mount solely by drilling holes in the
floor of the car. If you get upside down you may find the legs sticking
out the bottom of the car. At the least, get a cage or bar that mounts
to welded plates that attach to the sills of the car. If it going to be
a dedicated track car and the class you are running in allows it, you
probably want to weld the cage directly to the car for additional
strength. I'm not going this route because I want to be able to remove
the cage.

Having said that, the installation of the bar portion of the cage is
most of the work. So you may as well get the rest, particularly if you
are tall. I personally don't think the B/C-pillar is going to collapse
as much as the A-pillar and a roll bar won't help much.

There are 3 vendors who offer cages that attach to the sills: OG,
Racetec, and Stable Energies. They are all listed in Pano. They are
$800-$1000 for the parts and another $800-$1000 to install. These cages
have removable side bars to allow easier entry when you are not
competing.

Another alternative is to get a custom welded-in cage from a fabricator
who knows what he is doing. Depending upon the class you want to run,
such as SCCA ITS, you may have to do this to be competitive since it can
substantially strengthen the chassis. I heard of one in the DC area who
is supposed to be top notch. You could actually save money on this
approach since the work is confined for the most part to the interior.

See you at the track!
