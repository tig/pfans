I can't help you on the tech inspection, but I can tell you about the
classing of the  car.

1.	You are right 194 2.0L with carbs puts you in I, were you don't have
a chance, unless no one else shows up.
2.	On the other hand if you are building a race car, you can go to the
GT class and build the car well and win. (The under 2.2L class is just right
for you, the /4 is less weight than the /6 and you can make a 914 less
weight than a 911 so it might be the hole to run in.
3.	The class is not related to skill level, I run in J and ran against
one of the best drivers I know (Dave Milton), and I have beaten GT-3, and I
cars driven by poor drivers.
4.	Class is only related to money not skill.

The first rule in racing is read the rule book and then build the car to the
top edge of a class, then finish the race and you have a chance.

	Regards,

Dan

	Is there anyone within an hour or two of Ann Arbor, MI, who could
have a
	look at my 914 and give me a (relatively) definitive answer on what
PCA
	club racing class I'll run in? I'll bring you the car and dinner.

	I'm planning on going to the rookie school and the race at Mid-Ohio
in
	May. My car was not built to any class-based rules so I'm going to
be
	bumped up a class as "prepared" in the stock groups, at the very
least
	(for carbs). 

	Now I'm worried I might actually be put in GT, which would be
utterly
	nuts, given my driving skills and vehicle. 

	I know I won't be competitive, so as long as I stay in the H, I, J
class
	vicinity I should have someone to run with, which is all I'm hoping
for.
	Running with the GT folks would be a nightmare on wheels. Talk about
	deerlighting.

	The car is a '73 914 2.0. My goal is just to get out there; No call
from
	Penske on Monday expected.

	I've been DTFR (close relative to RTFM--Deciphering The F-ing
Rules),
	but I sure would like some experienced help. The club racers I know
	around here are mostly 944 TurboS guys.

	TIA.
