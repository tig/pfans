Dear John

Although I have no control on what is said on the internet, you clearly have
no basis for your comments. 

First of all at IRP I was clearly lapping people thus I really gained no
positions on this alledged pass under the yellow.  If the stop and go rule
would have applied I still would have won.

At Sebring although we are still investigating what went wrong with the
brakes, I clearly had to go extra deep to get around these GT3 cars that are
very fast on the straits and then hold you up on the turns.

Please refrain from making ignorant comments in the future

Rafael LLopiz
