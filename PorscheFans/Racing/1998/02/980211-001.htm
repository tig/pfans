After a few track events or time on the street the creaking
of the dried out bushings will be unbearable on the street.
They are also not very comfortable. Unless you need the 
extra precision for competition (club race, serious autocross,
time trials etc) I would not use aftermarket bushings on a 911.

If you have sway-away rear spring plates you can easily
re-grease the outer bushing by just popping off the outer
adjuster plate without losing alignment. 

But I don't know how to get at the
rear inner bushing, or the front bushings. Can anyone suggest
methods of greasing these?
