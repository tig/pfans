I don't believe there can be any rule of thumb regarding orientating the car
Frontwards or Backwards on a trailer considering each car, trailer and tow
vehicle are different.  The appropriate tongue weight and overall balance are
the critical elements.  IMHO ref 911's, center the side jack lifting points
between the trailer axles and you'll have your best balance assuming of course
the trailer was designed correctly.  For my trailer that means driving
straight on.

Of course the lighter the trailer and car the easier but I would seriously
question using a trailer that was not strong enough to accommodate a load
leveller/torsion bar hitch unless you are well below the vehicle's maximum
towing capacity.
Keep the shiny side up!
