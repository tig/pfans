Hi Andy,

I follow what you are saying, but I have to disagree the effect is as
minimal as has been portrayed. I think that if I change the ride height
of my LF and RF by an inch that I have transferred more than 11 lbs. 

As an example, how much would you have to jack the RF and RR to
counteract the weight of a 220 lb driver versus a 130 lb driver? This is
the type of empirical number I'm looking for.

As another example, NASCAR guys throw a round of wedge in the LR at pit
stops to drastically change the handling of the car. Do you think that
effect is a couple of pounds weight transfer?

I hope this doesn't mean you will be leaving us?
