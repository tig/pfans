Hello P-Fans & Dana
	All of the "fixes" you mentioned will work. Like the old saying goes: You
wanna race? How fast do yaa wanna go? How much can yaa afford?  Speed=Money.

	I believe the '44 crankshaft is similar in design (one half and all) to the
928. On the 928 at high rpms the oil flow reverses above, say 5500 rpms. The
onlt way to solve this is redesign the oil flow inside of the crankshaft! I
think DEVEK has done this and others.
	Also the 944 cylinder head has a probem draining oil back to the oil
sump/pan. At sustained high rpms, oil get pumped and cannot return fast enough
to the oil pan/sump. I vagley remember a raceshop in Detroit durring the 951
Escort Series that would drill "a" hole in the cylinderhead "somewhere" so
that oil would return faster to the oil/pan. This shop charge something like
$3K to do this simply modifcation!!! 
	I think that a Accusump and changing your rod bearings ever winter is the
safest way to go.

Subject: Last! I promise, last message today!

I keep thinking up new things...  To anyone who has raced the 944 or 944T
or
variant.  I understand that the cars eat bearings because of a sustained
high RPM oiling problem  Is there a guaranteed fix?  Some people say
drill the crank, some says put in an Accusump, some people just say
rebuild the engine every few weeks.
What is it?

Dana
