   You see Mike, this is the common myth that most people believe; *tread design and depth is the most important factor in the rain*. The problem with this theory is that it does not take into account the durometer (softness/hardness/stickiness) of the given tire. What people don't realize is that a tire can still be *warmed up* even in wet conditions. By bringing it up to the warmest temp possible it will provide much more stick than a street tire like the Z50 or the S02. I have experimented in back to back tests with both Corvettes AND Porsches and the results are quite conclusive. The soft tire given enough tread (4 to 6/32) is always faster if given a chance to heat up a little. BTW, I am from Seattle and these tests were done at Portland International Raceway where it rains once in a while. Did you happen to catch the GI Joes 200 Cart PPG race last *JUNE*?? ;-)

   If your *tread is what matters* theory is true, then why would the *pro* racers *always* use rain grooved super soft rain compound slicks? It is the compound that matters the most, that's why ;-)

   Ok, you might just be gifted?? ;-) If you check the lap times from Sears last December I think you will find that a little ol *STOCK* class C 3,100 lb 993 on Kumho tires had the fastest lap of all competitors in the rain on Sunday morning by more than 4 seconds over another fellow from the Northwet Named Jeff Gamroth (3rd GTS3 Rolex 96) and I am not sure what Peter Kitchak's (winner GTS2 Rolex 97) times were in his GTS2 car. But on the results I looked at we were fastest and Jeff was second and I didn't look further ;-( 

   Hey, maybe I'm gifted??;-) Naw, I think I just have great tires and remember Mike, it's the compound that counts as long as you know how to warm them properly and that's a whole other chapter ;-)

Giddyuuup!!
BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be that important, now could it? ;-) white)
