Hi gang,
I'm running a '90 911C2 in F class of PCA Club Racing.  The '90 & '91 C2's
came with a puny and somewhat obscure rear caliper (like no one make a decent
performance pad for it).  In '92, Porsche upgraded the brakes by installing
the same front calipers in the rear.  Here's my question, is this within the
stock rules.  To quote the rule book, pg. 11, Section 4, letter B. " brake
calipers and rotors must be as supplied by the factory for the year and type
of vehicle".  Okay...that would be okay if the '92-94 C2's were in a different
class, however, they are not.  What's more, the weight  is the same for the
entire '90-'94 C2 range.  Has anyone any experience on this?  If you do,
please email me.  I'd also like to know if I have to change my brake
proprotioning valve to the later model too.

Thanks
