Hey Barry, you forgot to tell him, he needs more money.

BTW: J stock  914 2.0l, 924's, 356 supers is always 5 - 7 cars and is
growing every race, much to my dismay. One guy who they did  so quotes from
the Northeast said he had put about $30k into his car in setting it up and
he is a J-stock guy who I was eating up when the Summit point race got
called for a 944 balled up in the chute).

	Regards,

Dan

	Hello,

	Congrats on your decision to go club racing. Last year was my first
	year racing. I did two races, met a lot of good people, and had a
GREAT 
	time. The club race program was everything that I hoped it would be.

	> the beginner?  I am considering the big 3:  914; 944 turbo; and,
the 911

	I think most of the decision will depend on which car you like, and
	your budget. In racing, you need three things to be really
successful,
	money, money, and the final thing, money.

	It's not really that bad, but you get the idea. I don't think you'll
	be able to get / make a decent 911 for less than $20K. The 944
turbo's
	are a little cheaper, but still go for around $15K. I don't know
	enough about 914's to give you an estimate. The normally asiperated
	944 is a lot cheaper. You can find those set up for less than 10K,
	sometimes a lot less, like $6-7K. 

	Personally, unless you have a lot of time on your hands to work
	on the car yourself, I would not get a 944 turbo. The cars are
	complicated, not that many people know how to make them go fast
	(well, enough do, but not as many as for the 911), and working
	on them takes a long time. I don't like 914's. Around here (east
	coast) there aren't that many of them. Perhaps they all rusted
	to pieces?

	My recommendation would be to get an NA 944. The cars are cheap,
	parts are cheap (front brake rotors are like $35, springs are
	$100, water pumps are $70, etc.), the motors are very reliable,
	they handle great, and there will always be enough cars around
	for you to find someone to race with. 

	> (normally aspirated).  I would like a car that is receptive to
upgrades as

	I think it's always better to buy than to build. In most cases, you
	pay a lot less that way. I assume you plan on staying in the stock
	class. If you don't then winning really REALLY depends on how much
	money you can spend. In the stock classes, the amount of
modifications
	allowed is much smaller (still too many mods are allowed IMHO), so
	it's easier to improve your car (relative to everyone else).

	> auto-xing and track events.  I have no rwd experience and no

	You'll learn. Always remember that PCA racing is all about having 
	fun, and not about winning. As is often quoted, everyone who
finishes
	wins! 

	> One more question.  Is there a list of PCA car setup rules on the
web?
	> I've looked on a number of PCA sights with no luck.  Thanks for
the help.

	You need to contact PCA National and get a copy of the rule book.

	Good luck,
