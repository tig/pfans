I can only tell you about PCA club racing rules, which state in Stock
Classes you may go 1" over factory, and given the 5.5." was an option you
can go to 6.5".

		If I recall (not a sure thing by any means!), the Zone 7
rules for
	B-production state that you can go to 5.5" + 0.5", or a 6" rim.

		It might make sense for them to use the same set of rules,
but they
	don't.  As a matter of fact, there are many different rulesets in
PCA
	driving events.  (Purists will tell you that most of them aren't
really
	"racing"--and that's what we tell the insurance companies!)  PCA
Zone 7
	uses a fairly unique set of rules, which are different from those
used in
	Zone 8, which are different from those used at the PCA National
competition,
	which are different from those used for Club Racing, which are
different
	from those used by the SCCA.
		All these groups have different needs to meet, and all have
struc-
	tured their rules to meet their particular needs.  That can make it
tough
	to have a car that is competitive in more than one venue, but that's
the
	way it goes.
