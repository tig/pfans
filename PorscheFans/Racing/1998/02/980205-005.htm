I drive a 944 daily, and so does my daughter, my position on 944 as race car
is $'s are high and lots of people in the class. Plus a rail tap is very
expensive, and I if I put a good 914 on 50 series tires I can beat them if
they are stock, and that only puts me in "I", but that's were the 911 -
2.2's and 914-6 2.0l run so they can eat me.

Ah, picks your poison.

	The best PCA racers in my area encouraged me to learn on the 944NA,
which
	is also their car of choice. It's beautifully balanced, easy to take
care
	of, and parts are plentiful. They claim that 911's are "pigs" on the
track,
	and are easy for beginners to spin because of the odd weight
distribution.
	When I picked up a 911 and brought it by, they jeered me until I
gave it
	back.  When you think you've reached the limitations of the 944 and
can't
	get any better track times, let a good driver take you out on the
track and
	they will put your times to shame.  It's a car that's good for
drivers of
	all skill levels. 

	Even now that I'm in the market again for a 911, I will never take
it on
	the track and will only use it for a daily driver (really! I
swear!).  And
	I'll only drive my 944 on the track.

	Where am I going, and what am I doing in this handbasket?
