Someone recently questioned the roll bar spec for Club Racing, pointing
out that making the break between smaller and bigger bars at 1500 lbs
didn't seem right.  Golden Gate region makes the break at 2500 lbs.  None
of the production cars, which generally only have roll bars, weigh less
than 1500 lbs.

Here is what Club Race rule book says (and has said back to '93
anyway) for roll bars only:

Under 1500 lbs. - Mild Steel 1.5" x .120", Alloy Steel 1.375" x .090"
Over 1500 lbs. - mild: 1.75" x .120",  alloy: 1.825" x .095" 

My guess is that club racing borrowed its roll bar specs from the SCCA's
specs for grandfathered cars (pre-1979 registered with SCCA) which
were allowed to run with just bars and not full cages.  That's probably
where GGR got its specs, and the vintage outfit I am familiar with got its
specs.  

Those specs from 18.6.2.B of the '95 SCCA GCRs were:

under 1500, 1.5 x .120 mild, 1.375 x .090 alloy
1501-2500, 1.75 x .120 mild, 1.625 x 0.95 alloy
over 2500 2.25 x .120 mild, 2.00 x 0.95 alloy

The SCCA specs for roll CAGES are identical to the Club Race specs,
and make the break at 2500 lbs.  The Club Race specs sensibly don't list
a below 1500 lb spec for roll cages.  The cars just aren't that light.

So there would seem to be two "typos" in these rules.

Shouldn't we be using the numbers for less than 2500 and more than
2500, with result that SCs and later should be running 2 1/4" roll bars if
they don't have a cage and haven't had an alloy bar made up (all the bars
you purchase ready made are, I think, mild steel).   Looks to me that
somewhere the wrong stuff got copied.

If so,  the 1.825 x 0.095 alloy figure should be 1.625 too.
