Front Brake Rotors for 951: Slotted or Drilled

For Turbo S/'89 951 cars which are still close to their full weight and are
used for both street and track driving, I am not yet sure whether drilled or
slotted rotors are superior.  Of course, I refer to cars with the stock hub
and caliper set-up using stock-sized rotors.  Assuming that the car has some
sort of ducting arrangement that is optimized to flow air as aggressively as
possible, and also is using one of the preferred three brands of pads (id est,
Pagid, Performance Friction or Hawk), it is not yet clear to me which works
best.  I believe that both choices are superior to doing nothing at all.

Of course by now everyone should know the typical advice regarding rotor
sources for these cars.  That is, it is best to only buy the rotors that the
dealers sell in Porsche boxes.  Even rotors from Porsche's now defunct
Euroselect program did not hold up as well as the (then) more expensive
regular Porsche rotors.  The latter can now be had from dealers for well less
than $100 each, thanks to the new PPE pricing scheme established by PCNA.  In
fact, I'd bet that most dealers would match any aftermarket mail order price,
so there is no excuse not to start with the genuine factory parts, as opposed
to somebody else's "oem equivalent" Zimmermans.  I usually pay about $40 each
to have them slotted, so let's say for the sake of argument that they are
about $130 each by the time everything's said and done.

Last year, I tried the 968 M030 drilled rotors at the strong suggestion of an
expert whom I respect, Jeff Stone at Kelly Moss Racing.  I bought them from my
dealer for about $200 each.  Rationale: longer life without warping.  They
held up really well at our toughest braking track, Laguna Seca, but developed
cracks well before they showed significant wear after several other less-
stressful outings.  In fact, I had to stop using them at 31.8 mm (new
thickness is 32 mm)!

I casually mentioned this to my parts contact, and she replaced them under the
PCNA warranty.  (It pays to be friendly with your parts contact at the dealer.
Mine does favors like letting me "borrow" giant big red Brembos for the
weekend to take measurements).

For pads, I use Performance Friction 90 compound or Pagid Oranges.  I will do
more careful testing this year.  I'd say the slight edge for performance
versus price is slightly in favor of slotting so far.
