I have an '87 951 with the Cool Brake system installed.  My car has the brakes
from a Turbo S, so the rotors are larger than the standard 951s.

The Cool Brake kit for 951s is well thought out and pretty easy to install.
One shortcoming on my car is the fiberglass receptacle that mounts to the
spindle.  It allows air to potentially escape because it does not fully block
off the backside of the rotor.  It has a diameter that is about 1/2 inch too
small.  I added a semi-circular piece of aluminum (with rivets) so that the
entire back side of the rotor is blocked off.  The air has no choice but to go
through the rotor/hub.  I can test this with the car at rest by blowing air
through the ducts with my compressor. 

The Turbo S hubs will not allow air to bleed through like the NA 944.  The
Cool Brake kit for the NA 944 includes a blocking plate to prevent the bleed
through.  I am not sure about the non-Turbo S 951.  Recently Smartcamber
Products introduced special blocking plates for 911s, these may also work on
944 NA cars.

I got some great suggestions from the guys at Kelly Moss Racing on this topic.
The suggested omitting the fog lights and using those higher openings in lieu
of the factory openings in the lower part of the spoiler.  They feel that the
Cool Brake kit is okay, but the fog light openings provide a stronger, more
direct flow.  They suggest purchasing some standard NACA ducts from a racing
supply shop (e.g., Pegasus in Wisconsin), and fixing these to the backs of the
enlarged fog light openings.  They specifically suggested a certain type of
adhesive!  Then you run 3" ducting hose to the modified Cool Brake receptacle
at the spindle.  With this method, you have to cut out or remove the plastic
lining in the wheel well.  KMR even suggested a special kind of ducting
material that flows air much better than the "dryer hose" that comes with the
Cool Brake kit, or the typically available racing duct products.

I may try this approach later in the year, when it gets really hot.  I have no
complaints about the Cool Brake kit, but I am always in search of cooler
brakes since my car is so heavy.  I paid $100 for my Cool Brake kit-- from a
gentleman that advertised it as used in Panorama.  Given the time it would
have taken me to fabricate something effective completely on my own, it was
worth it.  Even at the standard $225-250 price, it would be worth it as a
first step toward cooler 951 brakes.
