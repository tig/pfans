I'd like to clarify a couple of points concerning Rafael Llopiz and the
race last fall @ IRP. Along with Jim Brillhart, I cosponsored the race
and during the race was on the grid and in radio contact with the corner
workers and national. Jon Lowe is correct; Rafael managed to not see
SEVERAL yellow flags that were being waved "energetically." He was
brought in by national, talked to and sent back out on the track which
consumed something in the area of 30 seconds, in my mind, a "stop and
go." He did go back out, and then returned of his own free will. Yellow
flags are meant to be seen and complied with, not argued with and about.
During any event run by any organization of merit (including F1),
ignoring or "not seeing" a yellow flag has no excuse. This input has
nothing to do with Rafael as a person, nor the parts constituting his
car. All of us have to race within the rules; in this particular case,
not racing within the rules should not have resulting in a claim for a
superior product. It cheapens all of us.
