Hello,

<< 
 I don't believe there can be any rule of thumb regarding orientating the car
 Frontwards or Backwards on a trailer considering each car, trailer and tow
 vehicle are different.  The appropriate tongue weight and overall balance are
 the critical elements.  IMHO ref 911's, center the side jack lifting points
 between the trailer axles and you'll have your best balance assuming of
course
 the trailer was designed correctly.  For my trailer that means driving
 straight on. >>

This would make the C of G OK for tongue weight, but the huge chunk of
weight (engine) on the rear of the trailer (inertia) is asking for trouble 
IMHO and in my experience towing with SUVs without weight distrubuting
hitches.

>> But my new aluminum TRAILEX trailer manual says not to use
>> a load leveling hitch
 
<< Of course the lighter the trailer and car the easier but I would seriously
 question using a trailer that was not strong enough to accommodate a load
 leveller/torsion bar hitch unless you are well below the vehicle's maximum
 towing capacity. >>

I was wrong, I thought my trailer literature advised against the
weight distrubuting hitch but it was just advising against use
of a  sway control device due to using a surge brake unit.

That sounds very reasonable for the advantages they they will give.
Can I convert my frame bolt-on U-Haul hitch to load leveling?

>> For those of us with steel trailers (twice as heavy and 1/3 the cost of a
Trailex), I offer the following:
        1. A colleague commented that his Explorer with an equalizer towed
better than his Suburban without one (same car/trailer).

        With my 1986 Land Cruiser Wagon, steel 20' open trailer, and 1988
Carrera + 4 tires, I found the following weight distribution:

                           Without Equalizer    With Equalizer
Front Axle                     2080 lbs          2280 lbs
Rear Axle                     3080 lbs          2580 lbs
Trailer Axles (dual)        4440 lbs         4740 lbs                   
                                  --------                ---------
Total weight                 9600 lbs          9600 lbs
 
The car weighs 2800 lbs  and the combined trailer/tires/car weight
is 4860 lbs.  Measurements are with the car loaded forward.

The effect on front to rear weight distribution on the tow vehicle is
obvious.  I did not have heavy duty rear springs or shocks.  The cost of an
Equalizer is minimal, and is I second Ross's endorsement of these for all
race car trailers. >>

I like the idea of adding weight to the front of the tow vehicle,
and less on the rear axle. Seems weird that the trailer
weight goes up though. That does not sound like a "good thing".
I like to put as much equipment (100 pound toolbox, 8 spare
wheels/tires, spares, etc) in the Jeep as I can, 
and have just the car on the trailer to keep the trailer
light. I think the extra weight
on the trailer must come from a lower
tongue weight. I have about a 300 pound tongue weight (10%)
which is the same amount your trailer got heavier and your tow vehicle
got lighter. Are you supposed to have very light tongue weights
with a load leveling hitch?
Can anyone explain how this thing really works?
