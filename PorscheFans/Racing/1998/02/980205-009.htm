All,

Here's my $.02 on some of the items I ready in the digest today.

Rain Tires:

Full tread depth race compound tires will outrun normal street tires in
all but the worst conditions.  The softer tread compounds will allow the
tire to generate the heat needed to provide traction.  Only if there are
deep puddles and deep water running across the track will the street tire
have the advantage.  True racing rain tires have a much softer compond
then dry tires.  This is to allow them to generate the heat necessary on a
wet track.  Since they generate heat so well in the wet, the overheat very
quikly on a drying track.  That is why you will see cars going off-line to
find water to cool them back down again. In fact, you can run slicks on a
wet track, provided there are no puddles.  It will take longer for them to
heat up, but once they do, they work fine.  Some race teams will even hand
grove some slicks to run as an intermediate rain tire. 

Brake Ducting:

You need to be careful with do it yourself brake cooling.  If you only
point a hose at the inside of the rotor, you can very easily warp the
rotor because you are only cooling one side.  To properly cool a vented
rotor, as most porsche front rotors are, you need to force the air into
the middle of the rotor so it travels through the vents. 

Oil Cooler:

To the gentlemen asking about additional oil cooling for his 2.7, ask
yourself this question.  How serious am I going to get and will I be
making any modifications to the motor to get more HP?  If you plan to do
more racing, and making engine mods, do it right the first time and put
the cooler in the front.  Why upgrade the fender mounted cooler, then come
back in a year or so and have to upgrade to a front mounted cooler. If you
are only going to do ocassional drivers ed events and keep the motor
somewhat stock, you can just put a better cooler in the front fender.  If
you have not already done it, you can cut the backk of the headlight
bucket out to get better airflow to the cooler.  If you do the cut out
correctly, you can remove the light for track events, and then put the
light back in for the trip home and around town.

Thats all I got to say bout that.
John
