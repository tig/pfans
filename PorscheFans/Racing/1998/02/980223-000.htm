    Sorry, Paul, but Mike's correct... It's impossible to get any
    significant front-to-rear weight transfer by changing front (or
    rear) ride-height.

    Corner balancing, contrary to popular belief, does NOT (usually)
    result in equal weights at all four corners; what it DOES do is
    give you equal CROSS weights.  That is... In a corner-balanced
    car, the sum of the left-front and right-rear weights will be
    equal to the sum of the right-front and left-rear weights, but
    the ratio of front-axle weight to rear-axle weight will likely
    NOT be equal.

    To verify this, you can perform the following simple experiment:  

        1.  Lift one side of your desk about an inch off the ground.
            Get a sense of the weight.

        2.  Raise it up another inch and see whether it feels
            significantly lighter.
