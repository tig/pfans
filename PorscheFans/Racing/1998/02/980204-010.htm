I have track\street high mileage  15OK plus 1979 3.0 liter 911SC with the a 
stock CIS system and a borla muffler which has been updated with the late 
Model Carrera tensioners and pop off valve.  Engine still runs strong 
having won a zone championship.  The car is driven pretty heavily in PCA 
and POC competition events,  10+ autocrosses and 4+ time trials in a 
season. I plan to hopefully compete in the same number of events in the 
future wallet willing.
While tearing the drivetrain down for the 98 season we discovered the 
following:
1)	Two cylinders had a higher than 25 percent leak down at the rings. The 
other four were in the 10 to 20 range.
2)	A cracked valve spring retainer
3)	Excessive wear on the cam lobes.
My mechanic claims the early 911sc does not provide the oil pump pressure 
to support the Carrera tensioners and actually leads to premature wear and 
failure of the cams. Has anyone one experienced this problem? I think it's 
a heat or oil spray bar problem.
I have three options with a limited budget of 3k Plus:
1)	replace valve spring retainers, fix oil leaks and sell motor as is. Look 
to purchase a Euro Spec low mileage 3.0 liter SC engine to move to next 
class competing against 3.2 Carrera's and 944 turbo's. Most attractive 
option to me excluding problem smogging motor. Will the car pass through 
California smog using My US catalyic and smog pump?
2)	Top end rebuild of present tired 3.0 liter including rings, valve job, 
high performance valve springs and high duration cams. Second most 
attractive option although possible excessive bearing wear is a problem.
3)	Complete rebuild teardown of motor and inspection of bottom end. Can not 
afford at this time,  but may be best  long term option.

Any feedback on any of these options would be appreciated.
