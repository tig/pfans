Paul, can't help you with the rebuild, but I would suggest that you also =
replace your idler arms.  The newer style (from 1980 on) have a larger =
bearing surface and they use bushings.  The older style that your car =
probably still has have a tendency to bind, which supposedly made life =

You should be able to get both arms for about $150.  You should do this =
even if you go to pressure fed.

Good luck!
