<<<<Lemme give this a try; for some reason it was an interesting
question that I
had wondered about also, so I dove in and tried to come up with a simple
geometric solution.  Please feel free to illuminate areas that are
"questionable" :-).

Anyway, it certainly can be calculated mathematically, as long as you
are
changing both fronts by the same amount (otherwise the sway bars start
transferring weight across diagonals and things get very hairy very
fast). 
By raising the fronts, you are moving the center of gravity of the car
upward along a circle whose center is the rear axle.  The added weight
on
the rears will be due to the very slight movement of the CM toward the
rear
as you move along that circle.

Assume a 60/40 rear/front weight distribution, meaning that the CG is
40% of
the way up from the rear axle toward the front axle, with wheelbase
2.272m,
and CG about 2' high (0.6m) -- 0.3m above the rear axle; that's a guess
but
you'll see that it doesn't matter a lot for this question.

The angle from rear wheel axle through the CG is then:

        arctan (0.3m/(0.4*2.27m)) = arctan(0.33) = 18.3 degrees

By lifting the fronts by 5mm, you are moving the horizontal CG position
relative to the rear axle by (to first order):

        5mm * 0.4 * tan(18.3 degrees) = 0.66 mm

which is a relative distance change of:

        0.66 / (0.4 * 2272) = 0.00073, or 0.073%

and therefore an actual weight change of 0.073% * 3,000 lbs, or 2.2
pounds! 
(1.1 lbs per wheel)

I.e., don't even consider its effect in terms of changing weight
distribution.>>>>

Hi Mike,

I'm not sure where your equations are off, but I suspect you are way low
- by more than an order of magnitude. By applying your formula, you get
11 lbs of weight transfer for an inch change in ride height. I don't
think so...

Does anybody have some empirical data?
