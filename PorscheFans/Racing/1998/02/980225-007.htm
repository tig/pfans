Forwards or backwards??  I have used two different trailers, one I had to
tow backwards, and the other, my current trailer, I tow forwards.  The
first trailer was rather short, so I needed to put the car on backwards to
get the correct balance.  My current trailer is longer, so I can put the
car farther forward.  The rear of the car is sitting over the axles, so I
get enough tonque weight.  This trailer tows like a dream.  Perfectly
straight, no sway at all.  I'm thinking about adding a "load leveling"
hitch, but I'm not sure if it's necessary.  

The biggest problem I have with my trailer is a lack of brakes.  Can
electric brakes be added?  My truck is a 97 Ford F150 with the towing
package.  What is required and where can I get it.  Traveling in FL and
southern GA, has not been a problem, but I have plans to go to Watkins
Glen this year, and would prefer to have brakes for the mountains. 

Thanks
John
