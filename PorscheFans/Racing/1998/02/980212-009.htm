Hey guys,

Based on the current bushing thread, I spoke to a friend of mine who
owns a "thermal engineering" company...basically he works with plastic
composites and coatings exactly like what we are talking about here. 
One of his major contracts is NASA - he builds bearing cages for the
Space Shuttle booster rockets that are use in 36,000 RPM conditions! He
knows his stuff.

I showed him a set of Weltmeister rear swing arm bushings, and explained
the problems with squeal, grease fittings, etc.

He said he is capable of producing machined suspension bushings in a
number of durometers, ranging from factory rubber to non-elastic
(torlon).  In the higher durometers (stiffer bushings) he can add Teflon
as part of the plastic formulation process, producing a bushing which is
self-lubricating for its lifespan.  The downside is apparently that the
teflon produces a more plastic compound (when combined with other
chemicals); one which deforms more rapidly than the same duometer
bushing without the teflon introduced.

The question, then: Is there a market for race-stiffness bushings, which
are quiet as street bushing without the need for lubrication, but which
need to be replaced, say, every two years?
