The best PCA racers in my area encouraged me to learn on the 944NA, which
is also their car of choice. It's beautifully balanced, easy to take care
of, and parts are plentiful. They claim that 911's are "pigs" on the track,
and are easy for beginners to spin because of the odd weight distribution.
When I picked up a 911 and brought it by, they jeered me until I gave it
back.  When you think you've reached the limitations of the 944 and can't
get any better track times, let a good driver take you out on the track and
they will put your times to shame.  It's a car that's good for drivers of
all skill levels. 

Even now that I'm in the market again for a 911, I will never take it on
the track and will only use it for a daily driver (really! I swear!).  And
I'll only drive my 944 on the track.

Where am I going, and what am I doing in this handbasket?
