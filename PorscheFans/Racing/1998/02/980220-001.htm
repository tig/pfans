Al,
Sorry for the last message without any comments, hit send prematurely.
Al, NO the Triads are not even in the same league as the B&B header system
for your 911. Unless they have started manufacturing them again, (went out
of business a few years ago when owner passed away?) the original Triad's
were made of steel and the quality was much less than that of B&B or SSI
(understatement to be sure). I think that when they were manufacturing them
the only cost $500 or so new so no $500 is not a good deal. In my opinion,
nothing is a good deal for Triads unless you like the looks of a painted
exhause system that will rust.
I don't know what your intentions are (racing, street, autocross, driver ed,
combination) but for anything less than pure racing (in which case I would
use headers and not heat exchangers) I would opt for the SSI's. The quality
is fantastic (I have the first set I bought over 20 yrs ago still running on
a car daily and they still look and function as new) and you will be pleased
with the throtle response when coupled with a good free flowing muffler and
a chip change. If you are running a stock cat exhause system, any of these
systems will be like taking the bananna out of the tail pipe.
I do like the looks of the B&B header system w/ their muffler and would say
they might eak out a bit more power (no imperical evidence though) and they
have more of a tuned header look.
Both the B&B and SSI's use a high quality stainless construction and their
welding and construction is perfect. If it's in your budget, go with the B&B
else the SSI's with a good free flowing muffler. Both of these will last you
a lifetime.
Good luck in your search.
Terry
