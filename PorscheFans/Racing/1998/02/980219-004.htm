Hi,

There have been several posts about "load leveling" hitches.
But my new aluminum TRAILEX trailer manual says not
to use these. Anyone have any comment on this?
Maybe due to the long center aluminum beam?

I don't plan on using one so I was glad to see that warning
(more $$ for stuff that makes it faster on the track!).

I have no problem towing my 2300 Lb 911 on a trailex
(loaded backwards of course! NEVER tow a 911
forwards.) with a Grand Cherokee V8.

Once I towed a 944 backwards and it was TERRIBLE!
I thought they were supposed to be well balanced...
