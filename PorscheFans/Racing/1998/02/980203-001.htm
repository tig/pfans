<<I am trying to run some brake venting for my 1989 944 Turbo.  I have
removed the front driving lights, and it looks like if I drill a 1 1/2"?
hole there it will be a good way to run flexible ducting back towards
the brake rotors.  I'm pretty good with fiberglass and really don't want
to buy a brake ducting kit.

Can someone who has bought a kit or designed there own give me some
advice on how to run the ducting, mount the ducting so as to not
interfere with the wheel movement, and get mucho air to the brakes?>>

Hi Matt,

If you look below the driving lights you will see there is already a
colling inlet hole through the bumper. This was provided for the Turbo
Cup cars to provide brake ducting. You need to cut out the plastic in
the fender well to get it to go all the way through. I believe the Cool
Brake Kit from OG Racing can be used to finish the job. I am envisioning
doing he same thing to my car. It would be nice to hear from someone who
has used this kit in this fashion for installation details.
