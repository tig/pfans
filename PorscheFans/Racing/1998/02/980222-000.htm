	Mike:
	The 993Twin Turbo performance exhaust is 100% T304 Stainless Steel.
Mandrel bent with 4" mirror polished outlets. It saves 35lbs from the rear
end of the 993 Twin Turbo. It fits all 1996-1998 TT models including the
Turbo S. I have not dynoed it yet- as my plastic surgeon friend has not
warmed up to the idea of disconnecting the front 1/2 of the 4wheel drive
system off the front of the transmission case.
	However, I have been informed by independent sources that the system
reduces/shaves 2/3 of a second off 3rd gear acceleration testing from
3000rpm to 5000-5500rpm. An many Porsche tuners have used the system and
reprted back that it works well and they definetely noticed via seat of the
pants. The system incidently has been used on Jochen Rohrs Twin Turbos, 2
time winner of the daytona 24hr GT1 and IMSA and Sportscar GT1 1996 and
1997.  

	The Twin Turbo testing comprised of 10 same day in car with stop watch
steady state 3rd gear WOT runs with the car stock. Throwing ot the high and
low times and then taking the average for an elapsed time. The tester then
installed the 993TT system and repeated the tests the same day. From the
weight of the car and a formula of mass and acceleration of  he concluded
that the car picked approximately 35hp. I list the system in Panorama and
Excelllence at 30hp. A great sounding and performing 1 1.5  hour bolton for
$630 that includes shipping and a money back guarantee if not happy. Call
me fore more info and plenty of references of shops and 993TT owners.
