	<snip>
	The budget (and the wife) is about ready to allow me to take the
plunge
	into PCA racing and I need some advice.  Which platform is
recommended for
	the beginner?  I am considering the big 3:  914; 944 turbo; and, the
911
	(normally aspirated).  I would like a car that is receptive to
upgrades as
	my skills improve and I'm ready to move on to the next level.  Would
any of
	these cars place any particular limits on this plan?  Would it be
better
	(ie more cost effective) to switch to a car that is already sorted
to
	compete at each level?

Wow, one of my favorite subjects!


Ok here is the way to look at it (ala Dan).

Questions:
1.	Where can I compete best
2.	Where is the safest racing
3.	What will be cost to compete
4.	What is my exposure (money, health, danger)

Answers (mine):
1.	I look for a class where the head count is 5 - 7 cars, that's enough
to race with and still have a chance to make it to the top without getting
killed by the numbers. (In my area 944's and 944T run about 10 - 12 in the
class).
2.	To quote an old drivers education film "Speed kills" the fast you
go, or have to go to compete the more likely that little slip you or someone
else makes will be a real problem.
3.	Unless you are into body work or in the parts business the 944, 911
world will get expensive real fast. Although a 944 NA motor will run fine
for many hours of racing, the old rubber centered clutch will not take it
long. If you want to lower a 944 at all you need to switch to the FAB
control arms, etc.
4.	Exposures:
a.	Money - the more you have the more competitive you can be, a fact of
life. So look at your pocket.
b.	Health - Everything falls into this category (speed, stress, putting
yourself in harms way)
c.	Danger - More cars more chance of a screw-up which could result in
personal injury or a wife who will kill you when you need to spend $10k to
fix the car because somebody got lose and hit you. (there ain't no insurance
or other guys fault out there)

Ok that how I look at it, my recommendation is 914 2.0L 4 cyn. That's J
stock, you can race hard, go 100+ mph on the strieghts, and 85 in the
twisties. If you f-k up the car you can unbolt everything off it and get a
new one for less than a Fab control arm. The car is fun to drive, and after
a good rebuild of the motor to blueprinted specs you can have a great 914
and do it all for less that $5k for it all.

I bought my car for $1200, put $1600 in a rebuild, $500 in tires, $800 in
paint, $600 in a cage, $100 in net and kill switch, and $300 in drivers
suit. That's it !

I have raced in PCA for 4 years, and each year I go through 1 set of tires,
4 sets of brake pads, and three coolers. I run against 5 -6 cars on an
average and normally come in the top 3, lots of thirds, seconds, never a
first. I have fun and have driven through other peoples spins and wrecks and
keep on running to come in the numbers.

BTW I plan on each race costing about $1000.
	Entry fee $250-300
	Hotels 	  $300
	Meals     $  75
	Brakes    $100
   	Gas -Oil      75
	Things !   $250 (must haves)

Bottom line: When your starting out don't try to beat the big boys, they
have more money, time, balls, and experience than you do and you can't beat
that. Get in where you can learn, be safe, and build the seat time needed to
have a chance at winning. Racing is "putting yourself and your family in
harms way" go gently.
