Dana Kincaid asked has anyone raced a Boxster. What is it like and how does
it perform? 

I special ordered and have driven at several tracks a Boxster that was on
stock tires but with a special factory OEM sport suspension with HD shocks
and Antiroll bars, 17" wheels and Michelin Pilots and LSD with traction
control. I bought the optional hardtop too! No rollbar nonsense.

The Boxster is best described at being so well balanced. Compared to my
tricked out 993 and RS Americas and 993 TTs I have instructed in there is
no dramatics and feeling of having to work or force the car to do something
that it really does not want do.
For instance on 911s you have got to brahe late and trail brake to get the
car on a good lap time and to get the pig to rotate for the apex etc. Then
as you pick up the throttle the bitch starts to sit back and understeer
through the rest of the turn to track out.

The boxster is just the opposite and would devastate 911 and 993 if I just
had 100 more horses! It brakes very well and one can turn, trail brake and
turn with confidence. There less effort as the weight balance is perfect.
The boxster is almost tossable and you can quickly place it anywhere with
little effort. It just needs more HP for my liking. However, it is the
minxs' machine and other than a exhuast system
and Pagid pads I am not going to mess with it. Lastly, every car sooner or
later needs more POWER!
