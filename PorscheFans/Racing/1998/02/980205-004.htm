Hello,

Congrats on your decision to go club racing. Last year was my first
year racing. I did two races, met a lot of good people, and had a GREAT 
time. The club race program was everything that I hoped it would be.

> the beginner?  I am considering the big 3:  914; 944 turbo; and, the 911

I think most of the decision will depend on which car you like, and
your budget. In racing, you need three things to be really successful,
money, money, and the final thing, money.

It's not really that bad, but you get the idea. I don't think you'll
be able to get / make a decent 911 for less than $20K. The 944 turbo's
are a little cheaper, but still go for around $15K. I don't know
enough about 914's to give you an estimate. The normally asiperated
944 is a lot cheaper. You can find those set up for less than 10K,
sometimes a lot less, like $6-7K. 

Personally, unless you have a lot of time on your hands to work
on the car yourself, I would not get a 944 turbo. The cars are
complicated, not that many people know how to make them go fast
(well, enough do, but not as many as for the 911), and working
on them takes a long time. I don't like 914's. Around here (east
coast) there aren't that many of them. Perhaps they all rusted
to pieces?

My recommendation would be to get an NA 944. The cars are cheap,
parts are cheap (front brake rotors are like $35, springs are
$100, water pumps are $70, etc.), the motors are very reliable,
they handle great, and there will always be enough cars around
for you to find someone to race with.

I think it's always better to buy than to build. In most cases, you
pay a lot less that way. I assume you plan on staying in the stock
class. If you don't then winning really REALLY depends on how much
money you can spend. In the stock classes, the amount of modifications
allowed is much smaller (still too many mods are allowed IMHO), so
it's easier to improve your car (relative to everyone else).

You'll learn. Always remember that PCA racing is all about having 
fun, and not about winning. As is often quoted, everyone who finishes
wins! 

> One more question.  Is there a list of PCA car setup rules on the web?

You need to contact PCA National and get a copy of the rule book.

Good luck,
