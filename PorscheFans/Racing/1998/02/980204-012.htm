Uhm, NACA ducts in the front of a car? That's not what NACA ducts were
designed for. They're designed for very low drag applications in laminar
flow areas, not super high pressure and high drag areas. A plain ol'
open duct is all that's needed if it's going on the front of the air
dam. On the side/hood/roof though, that's a different matter.

Definately.

I have my ducts aimed at the rotor just infront of the caliper. So the
rotor gets one last blast of cool air before going through the pads.
Also it was an easier place to mount them than just behind the caliper,
where the cool air would be hitting the rotor just as it comes out from
under the pads.
