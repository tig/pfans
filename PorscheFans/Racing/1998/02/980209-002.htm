I understand that the cars eat bearings because of a sustained
high RPM oiling problem  Is there a guaranteed fix?  Some people say

I have an 83 track 944,  I stock.  It has an 87 pan and windage tray...on an=
 84 motor that had 46K
miles on it when it went in the car....in 95-96 I ran about 12 race/time tri=
al weekends,
winning most of events I entered.  Over the winter of 97 we pulled the pan a=
nd replaced the
bearings.......it wasn't necessary as the bearings were perfect........

The later pan/windage tray combo seems to do the trick......

Also, run the oil level about 1/8" over the high mark....check it after each=
 session,
especially on the turbos as a worn turbo unit will suck oil.........My motor=
 rarely uses
oil, perhaps I'd add 1/2 qt near the end of a hard weekend.............even =
so I check it
after each session to be sure..........
