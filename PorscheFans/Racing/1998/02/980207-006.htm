Chris Kolstad <ckolstad@cisco.com> asked :

 
>> We are looking to get some more rims for our car to mount yet more rubber
 on.  What we have now at the 5.5x15 Fuchs (4 lug) with 205-50 rubber on it.
    The limit we can go to
 and still be legal for Porsche Club racing is 6 inches.  How much
 difference do you think this will make for road racing?  Also, is the same
 true for autocrossing? >>

Actually you can go up to 6.5" wide for PCA racing (1" wider than
stock) which were available on some old minilite wheels and
maybe others. But the tires you are running are too low
for PCA club racing in "stock" class (although you can run
them if you bump-up one class to "prepared"). You can't
even run 225/50/15 which would be ideal on a 6.5 rim.

1" wider wheels will certainly help
but the tire is very important, I don't know what size will fit
on the rear of a 914. I ran 185/70/15 on my 914/1.7 in the
old days. Maybe 195 or 205/60 would fit.

You might want a set of 7 x 15 with 225/50/15 for autocrossing.
In BFG R1s, they are not much taller than the 205s but are
a lot wider and work fine even on a 6" rim.
