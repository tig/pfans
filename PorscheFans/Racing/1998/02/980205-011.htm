Joe Wilkinson asked about oil cooling for his 74 Carrera:


Soon to be fellow Club Racers,

I am getting serious now about going Club Racing and wanted to get some
advice on additional oil cooling for my 1974, Stock 2.7, CIS Carrera
that I am evolving into the Club Racer it was meant to be.

Currently I have the factory loop cooler under the fender but I feel and
have been told that I probably will need additional cooling. At drivers
Ed events I have seen temperature creep up to around 240 at the end of
my 20 minute session.

Any idea on how much improvement I might see if I change out to the
factory radiator type cooler, ala 3.2 Carrera. This would be the easiest
option....

My advice would be to purchase a front valance mounted oil cooler, complete
with aeroquip lines that mount to the factory hard lines in the fender, from
B&B Fabrication, Inc.  I've got one on my G class SC and have been very
happy  with it, running in 90+ heat in several club races without the oil
temp going about 210.  Most times the temp gauge stays down just under 200.
I'd be very concerned about temps in the 240 range in terms of longevity of
the engine.  Plus, they're a national Club RAcing Sponsor and also really
good people.
HOwever, you'll have to do something to fit the cooler into the space where
the valance is, as the factory valance doesn't give you enough space.  May I
suggest an IROC replica front bumper/valance combo from GT Racing, also a
national sponsor.  I replaced both front and rear bumpers iwth their
fiberglass bumpers and lost 60+ pounds, exactly where I wanted to in order
to get down to class weight.  Plus, the front bumper/valance adds cooling to
the brakes, which has resulted in my brake pads lasting longer and no fade
(getting the oil cooler out of the fender well was also a significant
improvment)
Both companies advertise in PAno or you can email me direct.  Best of luck
