Hi,

It's best to hit the streets any time you can, every few weeks
or once a month or so.
Otherwise gas and oil are sitting and tend to get gunked up,
(Hi King! "Mr. Sludge").
as do the brakes, suspension, etc. Especially an MFI engine,
the oil in the pump can get sticky and this has caused my
pump to go bad one severe winter. Even with carbs, the gas
will evaporate and you'll get goo in your bowls.
Maybe turn off your fuel pump and let the carb go dry
before killing the engine before a long sit??? Or add STABIL.

So I always change my
oil before winter and after winter and run the car hard
whenever the roads are clean. But I hate the winter gas up here,
with oxygenated fuel the car runs lousy.
