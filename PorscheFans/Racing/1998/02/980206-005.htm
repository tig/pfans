Is there a type of track racing where you can be by yourself on the
track racing a clock and NOT have to install a rollbar or make other
mods???  I just want to go around in a big circle,
make the best lap times and not have to modify the car at all.  (Yes,
wearing a helmet is expected.)
I don't want to bang fenders with the other cowboys, have to buy new tires
after running three hours,
buy FabCar control arms or have to add computer chip HP until the head
gasket blows out
or a main bearing fails.  I can always run out to Indianapolis Raceway Park
and take part in the
Tuesday night open class drags, but 944s aren't really set up to beat
Detroit iron in a race
off the line.
What I really want is to run from NYC to LA in 24 hours but with the
tickets I already have, that
isn't an option.  (Deathrace 2000 anyone?)
