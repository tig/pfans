   We have a set on our 740IL and they work very well on the street. If you
want the best rain track tire the Kumho V-700 Victoracer at full tread is
the best tire money can buy, period. R compound tires will always be better
in the rain than street tires unless the tread is lacking on the R compound
tire.

Why would you think R compound tires would always be better in the rain 
than street tires?  I have found the opposite. Although I will admit to not 
having experience with the Kumho, if it is anywhere similar to the BFG R1, 
at full tread it has less tread depth then a equally new street tire and I 
doubt the Kumho's tread design is such that it was designed to efficiently 
and effectively evacuate water as well a street tire.  At Brainerd 
International, Road America and Pocono, driving a 93 968 in the rain on the 
Firehawk SZ50s I have been able to keep up with the guys running R 
compounds.  At Pocono, Peter Dawe rode with me and was very impressed as to 
how well the SZ50s worked as a track rain tire; how predictable they were. 
 This from a guy (Dawe, not me)that has participated in the Daytona 24 for 
20+ years.

Just my $.02
