Probably.  Check with your hitch sales people. You will probably need a new
ball mount.

The trailer weight didn't really go up.  The trailer started at 4860 lbs.
It just transferred less weight to the truck when the equalizers were added.

The instructions with the equalizer  recommend a tongue weight of 10 - 15 %
of trailer weight.  They describe measuring tongue weight with the trailer
unhitched and measuring the weight directly under the ball.  This implies
that the weight transfer with the equalizer is not a true measure of tongue
weight, as it is affected by the adjustment of the trunnions.

>Can anyone explain how this thing really works?

The tongue weight of a trailer applies a downward force directly on the
ball. This applies a moment of force on a lever arm equivalent to the
distance from the ball to the rear axle of the truck. The fulcrum is the
rear axle.  This compresses the rear springs and levers the front of the
truck upward, accounting for the "nose to the sky" appearance of tow
vehicles with a heavy load and no equalizer.  The equalizer adds a pair of
spring levers extending backward from the ball and pulling the ball (and
hence the rear of the truck) upward. An engineer could explain the exact
force vectors involved.  The trailer balance is not  affected by the
equalizer, just the weight distribution on the tow vehicle.  The promotional
material from Reese (one of the equalizer manufacturers) has some pictures
and analogies to explain this without physics.
