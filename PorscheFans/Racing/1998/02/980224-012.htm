Your guidance/advice/suggestions will be greatly appreciated!!! Here's my
tale: After removing my 78 SC motor last nite I pulled the chain tensioner
covers only to discover that the right side was completely collapsed! The
tensioners are the stock 78 type (meaning - not pressure fed). Although I
understand the fundamentals of the operation of the tensioners I am not
completely sure if I have a problem or not. My understanding is that with
these type oil is collected through the top of the tensioner and drains
through the bottom? If this is correct, should I assume that because I drained
all of the oil out of the motor - including the tensioner that the collapsed
state is the norm - or is this wishfull thinking? 
If indeed the tensioner is shot, do I replace or rebuild? I am aware that the
"best" fix is to update to the pressure fed but alas my budget can't handle
that this year. With that in mind, and with plans to include pressure fed
types within the next two years, I guess I'm looking for advice on rebuilding
the originals.

My questions are as follows:

1) How difficult is it to rebuild my current tensioners?
2) How reliable are the rebuild kits?
3) What is your experience with them and can you offer any tips on doing it?

I am fairly new to this list but have already learned much! This is a great
service and I appreciate all of your opinions and expertise!!! 

By the way - I do have the collar type tensioner guards in place -- thank
GOD!!!!
