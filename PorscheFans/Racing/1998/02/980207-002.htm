You will need some "Butler Built" intake ducts and the appropriate 
high temp hose.  Longacre is a good source for these.  If you want to 
see the "optimal" setup for a stock class 951 (or prepared) check out 
the picture at http://www.drextec.com/racing.htm.  This worked GREAT, 
but you have to cut the front spoiler somewhat (might be smart to buy 
a cheap fiberglass one and store the factory piece) and you have to 
relocate the oil cooler (I replaced it with a pair of Mocal Coolers 
from BAT).  You'll be able to run the hoses (get the 3" high temp 
versions) directly to a "cool brake" distribution duct on the front 
wheel hub.  You need a LOT of cooling with this car, and this will get 
you what you need for 100 degree days at Summit Point in WV.  Run 
slotted (not drilled) rotors with PFC 91 compound pads and AP 550 
fluid and you will have brakes that actually last long enough for a 
PCA race.

Longacre is a good source for the high temp hose.  This is NOT Dryer 
hose.
The air ducts that attach to the hub can be purchased from OG Racing 
(they are included in the "cool brake" kit, but can usually be bought 
separately).  Not worth the trouble to make your own, and be sure to 
block off the air passages in the hub.  A small aluminum scrap works 
fine for this, just rivet it to the inside off the rotor - Don't drill 
into the hub to mount it!
