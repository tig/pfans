Hi Paul,
The ride quality of the car as it hits big holes and dips/rises is
mostly affected by spring rate and shock absorber response. In contrast
the bushings will affect what you feel from the smaller imperfections in
the road, old pavement with lots of large aggregate will make you
appreciate soft bushings.  Tire choice will also affect this feel.  

My car has reasonably stiff springs, shocks built to match, and the
Weltmeister street hardness bushings.  When I put on R1 tires it seems
as though I can feel the texture of the road including every stray piece
of gravel  and expansion crack.  With a taller and softer tire I have a
lot less feel of the road and a ride that I like.  This works well for a
car that I like to take to the track and drive on the street (with the
less aggressive tires). 

However
The SQUEAKS will drive you nuts unless you make some preparations before
you install the bushings.  The surfaces that the bushings go against
have to be smooth. You need to use grease during assembly.  Some times
the squeaks start after the grease you originally put in has moved away,
so it is best to find a way to install some grease fittings and put a
small groove around the bushing so you can add more grease if the
squeaks start.  Currently my car makes many squeaks on bumpy roads while
I make plans to partly disassemble to add more grease.
