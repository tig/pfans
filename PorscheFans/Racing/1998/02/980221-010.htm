Paul I'll relate my experience from running these cars at track events and PCA
racing since 1985. First of all don't bother with cross drilled rotors even if
they are manufactured from Porsche. Simply, they don't hold up. Micro cracks
radiated between the holes after one good session and soon they radiated to
the outside of the rotors, rendering them unsafe. (This is what I found out
from running a 930 which had stock drilled rotors). Never had drilled rotors
on a 951.
As for slotted rotors I never noticed any advantage and they were prone to
warpage. Also, even though the slots were shallow, they seemed to act as
stress risers. I had two instances of cracked rotors and have seen rotors that
actually came apart at the slots. 
I finally came to the conclusion that the only part that needs to be slotted
were the pads themselves. I worked for quite awhile with a large brake company
and had extensive talks with their head brake engineer who is also an
accomplished racer in IMSA and SCCA. As a result I got to compare and contrast
many different compounds. He also advised that in most instances unslotted,
undrilled rotors with slotted pads were the best bet unless you were willing
to throw away rotors on a regular basis.
This is one data point and I'm sure the topic can be extensively debated. I
should also mention that I had one instance of a cracked rotor with a stock
951S front rotor (PF pads). It was not slotted or drilled, it simply failed.
Of course it was on its' second season.
Regards, 
Jerry
