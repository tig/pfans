Depending of course on your priorities, the 3.2 Carrera motor should have 1
5/8 headers to allow for the best combination of throttle response and top end
power.  The SSI 1.5" headers offer better throttle response but our rear wheel
dyno tests proved you get "0" top end gain.  Largest 1 3/4" headers lose
significant throttle response offering the benefit of higher peak power -- but
only at the very top when flow is at its maximum.  The ultimate is the B&B
stepped design with 1 5/8" primaries flaring to 1 3/4" just before the
collectors giving you the best of all worlds.

I don't know what the Triads are you are considering but their quality in the
early days (I've never seen any SS versions from them so cannot comment) was
not up to Porsche quality -- quite poor really.

I would only consider SSI's for around town street application which at $500
swap meet used prices is quite a deal.  Otherwise if you are competing to win
step up to the plate and spend the $$ for B&B!!
