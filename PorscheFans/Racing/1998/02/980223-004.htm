     Someone recently made a post about ALWAYS towing a 911 backwards on an
     open trailer (the post mentioned he had a Trailex trailer).

     I recently spoke with Carl at Trailex ((800) 282-5042) about this
     subject, as I have an open aluminum trailer on order with them.  He
     indicated that just the opposite is true.  Trailex trailers that are
     built for 911s have modified axle lengths and weight distribution to
     compensate for the weight being in the rear.  He indicated that you
     would do more harm than good by towing it backwards.  You may want to
     tow backwards if your trailer was not designed for a 911 but do not if
     it was specifically made for one.

     I am no expert.  I am just repeating what the manufacturer recommends.
     Please call Carl if you have any questions.
