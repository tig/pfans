Yes.  My husband and I are both covered in drivers' ed events by Farmers
Insurance Exchange, and they covered his claim last year when he spun his
94 NSX black/black in turn 8 at Sears Point and went into the tires. Of
course it was 100% driver's error. ;-)

He was totally honest about what had happened, and had no difficulty with
Farmers whatsoever. They obligingly paid over $6k for moderate body damage
to his front passenger's quarter panel, bumper, and hood. The only
aggravation was that they required the Acura dealer to install a used
bumper that was available. Some preexisting nicks were evident when we
picked up the car, and had to return it to have them refinish the bumper
again.  The car looks and drives new. 

The insurance on his NSX has gone up only $10 a month, and they said it
will remain at that level for 3 years as long as he has no further claims.
It's still worth it. The only damage that remains is his pride. ;-)
