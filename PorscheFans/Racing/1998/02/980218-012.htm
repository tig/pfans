I'm not sure about State Farm (I guess I should be though, they're my
company too), but most companies will have an "R" word waiver that voids
coverage if the "R" word is used/done. I know for a fact that Mercury
Casulty covers (or at least covered) autox related accidents, and those
_are_ timed events. Ask me how I know...

I would love to find out if State Farm would cover me for Solo Trials
events in addition to the Solo2 and Autox stuff. I don't do any wheel to
wheel stuff, so I don't honestly call it "Racing". And the "R" word is
what makes insurance companies drop ya like a sack o' hot bricks.
