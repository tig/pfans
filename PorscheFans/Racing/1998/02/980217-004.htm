<<Once again, a rookie question posed to those who've been there - done
that.

I'm installing Recaro SRD's w/ shoulder strap and anti-sub cutouts in my
951.
At the same time, I'm installing an AutoPower bolt-in roll cage.

What's the proper routing of the shoulder straps for both the driver and
passenger side?  I used to mount shoulder straps at rear seat belt
points, and
drape over harness bar.  Should I run straps directly from rear seat
belt
anchor points through the seat backs, and over the shoulder?  Does the
seat
back replace the harness bar in avoiding spinal compression, in the
unlikely
event of extreme decelleration?>>

Hi Jeff,

Whatever you do, do not do this!!! You want the harness straps to be as
level as possible with the shoulders. Otherwise, you will compress your
spine in the event of an incident. Get a cross brace for the roll bar
part of the cage and mount the harness to that or use the rear seat belt
mounting points and loop it over the cross bar. The cross bar can be
bolt-in if you like. But the equivalent of your harness bar is critical
to ensure you remain as tall as you currently are. Also the SRD has an
adjustable rake - the downward pressure exerted on the back of the seat
without a guide bar will probably be enough to cause it to fail.

I'd appreciate knowing who you got the SRD from and how much it cost you
as I am in the market myself.
