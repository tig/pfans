Lately there have been a lot of kudos for the 944NA as the best buy race
Porsche. 

I agree and wish I had gone in that direction myself instead of the 911. Last
week there were no less than 3 running cars for sale in the local newspaper
for less than $5K that could be used for spares.    

I have a friend with a well prepared SCCA ITS class car for sale. As this guy
is the only person I let work on my car, I know his car has been done right.
If you are interested you can e-mail him at: asjhenry@aol.com
