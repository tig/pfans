I went through the same thought process with my '86 turbo last year.  After
days of #$%^ing around with trying to route the duct, tryng to support it, and
trying to get it in a position to actually blow some air on the rotors, I
broke down and bought a kit.  About a year ago I asked the same question you
did - and got the same answer I'm giving you.  A few thought they were
able to home-brew it, but the duct failed to stay in place on the track.  Only
one person replied that they "saw" a car that looked like it had a DIY duct job.
  The biggest problem is not at the front of car, its at the rotor.  Without a
properly formed rotor backing plate, with an attached "snoot" for the duct
that angles up and away from the wheel, its very difficult to support the duct
in a way that's both stable and effective.
The kits come with scoops that mount behind the horizontal slits below the
front bumper (so you can keep your driving lights), new backing plates for the
rotors, and duct material.  The stock plastic duct tube that runs through the
inner fender wall is removed, but its support bracket is retained to help
support the duct material (at least on an '86).  The metal deflector on the
strut is also removed.  On mine, the duct runs between the control arm and the
tie rod, other may orient it differently. I believe its 3" diameter material,
and it does have to be "squished" a little to pass between the control arm and
tie rod over the full range of steering.  I think this is the major wear
point.  OG racing carries the duct material.
  I'm sure with enough effort you could make the backing plates out of
fiberglass (mine are), but without a mold, or at least something to copy it
from, it will take you a while to get it right (as a former Lotus owner I've
worked with more fiberglass than I cared to).
  The kits are less than $250 dollars and in a couple hours your done.  Well
worth it in my opinion.
