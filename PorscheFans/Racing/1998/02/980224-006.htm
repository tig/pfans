A few folks have questioned cryo treating rotors here. I had to think
about it a little, but I'm not too sure that I would want to do that.
Bearings and rods and pistons, sure. But I consider the rotors as a
readilly expendible component anyway, and I'm not sure if hardening them
up is such a great idea. If that was such a hot thing, then why don't we
all simply have case hardened rotors to begin with. I't early, and I'm
still not entirely awake, but I think that the friction between the
rotor and the pad (which makes that middle pedal work for us) is
dependent on the intereaction between the pad surface and the rotor. My
understanding is that the superior braking ability of the harder pads is
achieved partly at the expense of the rotor. And if we harden the rotor
as well as the pad, then the grip the pad has would be reduced. Of
course I could be way off base too, like I said, it's early...
