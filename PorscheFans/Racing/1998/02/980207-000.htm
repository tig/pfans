Look into NASA, National Auto Sport Association. The 1998 schedule includes
track time at San Francisco, LA, Phoenix, Virginia, Atlanta, Seattle,
Chicago, Boston (tentative), Portland, Michigan, Hawaii. 510-232-NASA.

In addition to real racing and driver's ed, they have regular track days
and enduros where you can do pretty much what you asked above except that
you have to time yourself. Depending on what class you want to run in you
don't have to modify your car except to bolt down a halon fire
extinguisher. All cars must pass tech. Novices need only helmets.
Intermediates need to add five points and driving gloves. Advanced need
mesh windows and I don't know what else since I'm not there yet. ;-)

With that said, I'd still recommend that you hit their driver's ed
sessions. If you just drive by yourself, you're gonna develop bad habits
that you will never be able to overcome, and never get the lap times you
want. And you'll just be a menace to the rest of us.
