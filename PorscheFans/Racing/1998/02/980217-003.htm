Hi Jeff etal,
   The seat is absolutely not strong enough to guide a harness.  No 
way /no how /never.  This is one misconception we need to get rid of. 
 You need a strong properly designed bar to mount your harness.
   We recently had a guy hurt because his harness was mounted to a 
steel strap which was welded to his roll cage.  When he hit a wall, 
the strap gave way-the seat gave way and his head hit the wall on the 
passenger's side of the car.
   Your harness can and will keep you in position if it is mounted 
properly.  Your seat is to sit on.  It will move with you if you 
move.
   While you are at it, make sure your bar has a support to keep the 
seat fromgiving way to the rear.

Good Luck,
Dodge
