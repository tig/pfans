<Ptarga79@aol.com> asked :

<< I am autocrossing a '79 911 SC in SOLO II Autocross.  Class is "A" Stock.
There are very few porsches in our midwest region.  My car is box stock.  I am
looking at wheels and tires, perhaps Comp-TA  R1's, but am confused at sizes.
One person says to go with 8X15's all around to lower the car and gearing.
Another says go 16 or 17 inch diameter?  Any comments from someone who knows?

In SCCA A stock you can only use factory available rim sizes.
Best all around is 7 and 8 by 15" fuchs. Best tires would be 225/50/15
front and 245/50/15 rear. I ran those sizes on an '86 carrera in 1991
Nationals and was the only late model 911 ever to trophy there.
I believe the 7 and 8 by 15 were optional, I know they were on the
Weissach edition and a guy was protested in 86 or so with those
rims and found legal. Check your owners manual for proof.
