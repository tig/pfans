<<<I have come into possession of a tire durometer, and would like to
use it to
assess the condition of my street and track tires. Unfortunately, no
guidelines for it's use accompanied it. Can anyone refer me to a source
for
this information?

This is a dial type device, scaled from 0 to 100. Are these standardized
units? What range of values are seen for street and track tires?>>>

Gee, mine came with a 500 page operators manual. ;-)

Tire durometer readings are totally relative.

To operate the device:

1) Take it out of it's drawstring bag.
2) Press it into the rubber compound you are measuring so that the base
is against the rubber.
3) Read the relative hardness on the dial indicator.
4) Repeat as necessary.

It helps to take one of these with you when you are shopping for tires.
I guarantee you that nobody in the tire store has ever seen one and you
will make a huge commotion as you sample their tires.

Tires that will last 60-80K miles on the street have a very hard
durometer reading. Snow tires have a very soft durometer reading. Any
kind of 'racing street tire' such as the BFG R1 are also very soft. The
softest tires I've ever seen were the BFG R1s at Solo II Nationals back
in '89. You could leave a finger imprint in the tire by pushing on it. I
think the durometer reading was 32 on 'my' Rebco gauge.

Tire vendors hate durometers because they feel you just shouldn't know
this stuff. They will claim that since there is not durometer standard
that they cannot be held responsible when you tell them that your new
tires durometer at 50 while your competitor's new tires durometer at 45
even though you measured with the same durometer and they are supposed
to be the same tire!

The only prectical use I have found for it is to tell when the rubber on
a given set gets too hard. Measure them when the are new and track their
progress over time.
