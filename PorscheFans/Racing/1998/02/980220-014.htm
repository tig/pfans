Regarding Mike Piera's posting on the Racing Digest 2/19 as well as other
postings:

No data, but I would talk to Trailex directly.

Cost for a Load Leveler/Equalizer hitch is around $200 including the hitch
modification.

For those of us with steel trailers (twice as heavy and 1/3 the cost of a
Trailex), I offer the following:
        1. A colleague commented that his Explorer with an equalizer towed
better than his Suburban without one (same car/trailer).

        With my 1986 Land Cruiser Wagon, steel 20' open trailer, and 1988
Carrera + 4 tires, I found the following weight distribution:

                                                        Without Equalizer
With Equalizer
        Front Axle                                      2080 lbs
2280 lbs
        Rear Axle                                       3080 lbs
2580 lbs
        Trailer Axles (dual)                        4440 lbs
4740 lbs                   
                                                                --------
---------
        Total weight                                    9600 lbs
9600 lbs
 
        The car weighs 2800 lbs  and the combined trailer/tires/car weight
is 4860 lbs.  Measurements are with the car loaded forward.

The effect on front to rear weight distribution on the tow vehicle is
obvious.  I did not have heavy duty rear springs or shocks.  The cost of an
Equalizer is minimal, and is I second Ross's endorsement of these for all
race car trailers.
