I am in the process of building a 69 911 into a GT-4 club race car.  I'm
interested in the merits of chrome-moly vs. mild steel tubing for this
purpose.  I gather from PCA rules that alloy steels (such as chrome-moly)
may be used, and that tubes may be of 1.375 in. minimum diameter (instead
of 1.50 in. minimum for mild steel). I understand  chrome-moly is
considerably stronger, permitting the smaller diameter, and resulting in
weight savings. I know it is more difficult to weld, requiring TIG
instead of MIG, and that the welds must be stress relieved.  

Sounds like a slightly more expensive but good way to go.  But I just
heard that the SCCA does not allow chrome-moly cages; they must be mild
steel.  Can anyone confirm this? Why is that the case?  

I don't intend to do SCCA racing at this point, but I hate to be limited
by this factor.  Anyone have any opinions on the best way to go?  Some
things can easily be swapped to achieve legality across club lines, but
the cage is not one of them, and I hate to invest unwisely.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts.
