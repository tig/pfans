According to BFG, the starting point for cold pressures on the R1 is to add 
1psi for every 100 lbs. of vehicle weight and then add 2 lbs. to the end 
that has the engine.  For example my 93 968 has a curb weight of 3086 and 
is, obvious, front engined.  So I run 33-34 psi up front and 30-31 psi in 
the rear.  This seems to work extremely well on my car and using this 
formula I have been able to consistently lower my lap times.
