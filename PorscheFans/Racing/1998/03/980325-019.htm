Dodge,

Guess I wasn't clear enough...my point was, in this case of an apparently 
important change (details of why this was needed are now circulating on 
this list), they must have some parameters in mind.

I've never used a rear seat brace, have never installed one, have seen 
only a few, and have never studied them in any kind of logical detail.  
In other words, some helpful guidance from the governing body would, in 
my case, be appreciated!

Do agree with your sentiments on "too many rules=stops being fun".

Regards,

Chip
