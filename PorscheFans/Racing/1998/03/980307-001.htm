Cris,

Everybody seems to have a different philosophy. Many people are running
low pressures (25-26 lbs cold) and seem to like it. I started with 32
lbs and found the tires felt like tyhe side walls were giving up on hard
corners. I have now gone to 35lbs cold, and the tires are working
extremely well (and 32 lbs for autocross). I also seem to be using less
rubber up, and the car is more stable. Most people say that the R1's
provide more grip as you increase pressure, whereas other tires work the
opposite way. I think it's true.

Another problem with R1's is the 'groove of doom,' a groove that wears
quickly in the center of the tire. This is due to underinflation. The
people I have talked to that complain about this also run lower tire
pressures.

I suggest you read the R1 discussion on tire racks page
(www.tirerack.com). It has some good tips about R1's. 

My best guess?  ->>> Start with 30 lbs and work up.
