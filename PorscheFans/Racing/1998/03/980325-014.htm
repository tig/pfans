>> Mike Piera asks if any aftermarket (adjustable) bars attach to the stock
911 rear sway bar mounts on the banana.  I've sure never seen any
which did.  The mount up to '84 was a ball cup, and not the kind of thing
you'd expect to use for a racing application (Mike - what's wrong with a
spherical bearing for this application with the right size etc bolt or
adapters?  Race cars are made of these. <<

Yes I guess that is really best. But I am feeling down on these rod ends
due to my bad experiences with the links I have, and good
experience running the stock ball cup mount on my '72S
for 13 years with no problems (on original mounts!).

>>  Shame on the supplier,
though, for not knowing his NAS from a hole in the ground as the ad
says.  All of us who have read Carrol Smith now think of this as
elementary).   <<

Yes. I should also change the bolts that scew into the
camber adjusting bolt as they are a bit sloppy too.

>> Starting in '84 or thereabouts the factory switched to a bolt threaded into
the banana in the same location.  If anyone makes adjustable bars for the
later cars capitalizing on this you could use those.  Saw off your
mounting ball, drill and tap, and there you are (I did this with the arm on
the car, which was a mistake.  Take it off and use a drill press or a
machinist.).  This was an aluminum arm.  If you have the steel arm maybe
you can do same, but you have more options with welding.  However,
you will have to recalculate your bar rates as it is somewhat farther
back and bar lever length isn't like teeter totter lever analysis, I found to
my surprise in looking up the formulas.  It is a power higher than 1.  I
figured I'd have to make a special bar to have the bar rates I already
have, so that project has stalled.  What I have works fine, I just want to
get it above the tranny rather than below so I can save 15 minutes (if
everything goes well) on tranny R&R and get the adjusters up away
from the pavement which grinds them down so nicely.

While I agree that the camber adjuster mounting looks weak, I have only
had one problem in a dozen years with it - the wimpy little allen bolt (with
too much thread) broke off when the alignment shop tried to take it off,
because it had rusted in.  Never messed with my camber (those other
bolts hold things in alignment) even when the race tires rubbing on the
nut on the other side loosened the adjuster.  The bolt never broke on the
track or highway.  So maybe it is an elegant solution, cost effective, etc. <<

That could be true, if so it's the easiest thing for me to do
if I just upgrade my links. Has anyone had problems with
connecting the sway bar to the camber adjusting bolt?

It makes me nervous as I ran the Porsche Parade in '94 (?) 
at Lake Placid with no negative
camber on my right rear due to loosening rear alignment bolts.
I no longer attach my tow straps to the wheels (that was not too 
smart).

>> Welcome to becoming a race car engineer and not just a mechanic.  It's
kind of  fun, really. <<

Could be unless you make a mistake!!
