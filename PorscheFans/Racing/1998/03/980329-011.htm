I am currently running 15x6 Fuchs with 205-60-15 R1's on my SWB '68 912 vintage race 
car with no problems. In '68 the factory added spacers for some reason that I can't 
recall off the top of my head.

I have decided to put track tires on my '66 911 but cant find any tires
that would seem to fit.   My car has heavier torsion bars but not sure
how much heavier.  19 mm front stabilizer and 16 mm rear stabilizer.
Car is lowered about 1.5 in and has 6x15 fuchs alloys on all 4 wheels.
Body work is stock.  With 195/65/15 AVS  I have some tire rubbing on the
rear inside of the front wheel well (not the fenders) when turned to
full lock.   This car is used primarily for DE events so I don't think
this is an issue unless I am missing something.

I have not been able to find any "R" compound tires in the 195/65/15
size.  I thought I remembered hearing that R1's might fit where street
tires would not.  I also thought I might get 7 mm (1/4 in?) spacers per
factory recommendations.

Can I use 205/60 or 55/15's on 6 in rims ?   Any other advice on tire
selection would be appreciated.
