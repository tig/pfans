Thank you all for your advice and candid opinions on the subject!

Before I bought my current Porsche, I was
always advised by those more knowledgeable to keep the car stock for at
least the first year, so that I could get acclimated as well as tend to
the eventual maintenance items I'd discover.  Very wise advice indeed-
there were and still are a number of service issues to do before the car
is even 'showroom condition' let alone a 100 mile open road race.

It is my desire to become proficient at high performance driving with
this car and I'll be signing up for AX school with the PCA (and leave
the sticky tires waiting in the wings for this summer?).  That's got to
be the
best path for me at this stage:

AX #1 - wild spins (and learned to keep gas on when tail came out). 
Best lap was couple of seconds or so behind lead 928 on sticky tires,
but eating cones like no tomorrow.

AX #2 - 2 seconds off leader 928 on sticky tires, no cones!  I did good
that day (thanks to Mike Mitchell's help) with only three tries total 

AX #3 - boring times but no spins, 5 seconds off another street 928 with
thousands in suspension & tires/wheels. 1st time ever did slaloms. Could
not get 'hooked up' with course layout, swept course with cone under car
one time (where did that come from? ;)

Of course I'd like to do better! But not with tires masking my driving
deficiencies, that would be a disservice to myself, right, and could be
dangerous when I start venturing onto the 'big tracks'.

Last advice was to go fast, I need to slow down.  Don't rush the
learning
process.  Sure Kim Crumb is out there blowing everyone's doors off but
he is an experienced professional driver, with years under his Nomex
boots as well as prepared car (and soon a nice Carrera4).

So, again, THANKS for all the advice!  Let's see how it goes at school!
Wish me luck, I can't believe how fun this all is!
