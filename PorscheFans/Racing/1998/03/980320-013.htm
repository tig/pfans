I strongly agree.

When I first started driving my 911 on the track, I already had some
minor weight SCCA experience in a Neuspeed GTI 16v.  My 911 had
hr-rated p6's and 22 year old, unrestored stock suspension.   Well,
the car drove well but on the track it was the squirliest thing ever
admitted.   My instructors would hang on for dear life, even at slow
speeds because the car was getting easily out of hand.

My point is though, is that now the car is set up well, and all done
through understanding what "BAD" is.
And it is my feeling that if you never get to feel that and you jump
into track events in a new c4 with R1's, that by the time you really
lose it, you've lost it beyond recovery.

I saw, and not kidding, six 993s get totalled this summer at only 7
driver's eds on the east coast.
It seems that these folks are coming into track events with these hot
performers and never learn to get the car in and out of bad situations
because the new cars, like an older car with R1's is too good and too
unforegiving at the speeds that these folks being driving at.

that's not where the problem lies, it's when these guys go to four
events and feel real confident becuase they're blowing the doors off a
912 driven by a 20 year veteran, and equate it to their driving
technique instead of car.  Next thing you know, they've reached the
speed where the car actually may slide, and that's so fast that they
can't handle it when it comes.  because, when the first time you spin
is at over 100mph, you're in big trouble, as seen by all those who
witnessed any of the totalled 993s last driver's ed season in the east.

My advice:  Start with the shitiest car, tires, and set-up.  It makes
it more fun at a safe slow learning speed.  You will slide and spin,
and learn from all of that.  Once mastering it, perhaps then consider
sticky tires or suspension upgrades.
