Hi Pfans,

Nonsense. 100LL avfuel is about 118 octane
using RON system, and is essentially the
same stuff. There are -no- chemicals of any sort 
in it. The designation "100LL" means 100 Low
Lead, but this is a misnomer. It is only low
lead in relation to another older aviation 
fuel, and has about the same lead concentration
as old 1960's era high test leaded fuel. 

I run a small airport and buy thousands of 
gallons of it each year. I also live about
3 miles from a 1/4 mile dragstrip, and guess
who our best customers are on drag-days??


(I know that 1942 Case tractors run
on avfuel as well, since our grass mower 
has used nothing else since it was new... ;-)
