Josh,

And it can help them get out of that same trouble better than a less than
ideal car can taken to the edge. Are you forgetting that it is just as
easy, and sometimes easier, to get past the edge in a "normal" car? I have
always found it easier to control a well setup car with DOT race tires
than to control a "normal" car with DOT street tires. This was true even
when I did not know my but from apex.....
