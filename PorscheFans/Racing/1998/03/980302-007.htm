A friend of mine just recently purchased an '88 944 Turbo S.  The car has 80k
miles.  It is very clearly a well maintained car.  There are no signs of
abuse, no leaks, and it is clean and as tight as my '89 with 34k miles.  It
has had a clutch and motor mounts installed in the last year.  A very good
car.

However, there is a strange rumbling/grumbling noise coming from the transaxle
area that we cannot pinpoint.  It occurs when you are doing a slow moving
turn, like a parking manuever.  It does not happen with any kind of speed,
even in first gear.  Only at "parking" speeds.    The noise does not occur
when you let the clutch out in first gear going straight.  The owner seems to
think that the problem only occurs when the car is warm, but I was unable to
confirm this in my inspection.

We checked the CV joints and drained/refilled the gearbox.  Nothing unusual,
untoward or otherwise indicative of a problem.  Of course, as you all should
know, the Turbo S comes with a special gearbox, with a 40% LSD that is
stronger than the stock 951 LSD box.  The box also has a Porsche tranny cooler
system.  The owner suspects that something may be wrong with the LSD, but the
only symptom is this noise and some accompanying vibration.

I have driven at least a dozen 951 and 911 cars with the various factory-
installed LSD boxes and a few with Quaifes.  This noise is unlike anything
I've ever experienced.  The only unusual thing about the rear end set-up is
that for some reason, a previous owner has mounted sixteen inch 245 50 series
tires, instead of the stock 45 series size.

Many of you out there have experience with these or similar LSD boxes.  Does
this "problem" ring a bell?  Any ideas on simple diagnostic tests to pinpoint
the problem?  Thanks in advance for your ideas.
