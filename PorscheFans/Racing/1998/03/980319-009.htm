From what I can remember about the Audis from SCCA Trans Am.  The drivers
were Walter Roehl (sp?) and Hans Stuck.  The AWD was a tremendous
advantage over the other cars and the SCCA told Audi not to bring them
back the next season.  I don't remember the IMSA GTO version of this car. 
There were some Porsche 944 Turbo GTRs in Trans Am, but I don't remember
the time frame.  If I remember correctly, they were not real competitve
with the Fords or the Chevys either.  The biggest advatage the AWD Audi's
had was not speed.  They were much easier on tires and could easlily pull
away at the end of the race.  They still have this advantage in the
various touring car series in Europe and Australia.
