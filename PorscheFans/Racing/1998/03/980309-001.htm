Hi

Some of you will probably laugh your head of, but a friend and I have a 924
chassis, a 2.0L 924 engine and the sports-gearbox (5-speed dogleg) and want
to make it a track-car...

For now we chose for the 2.0 since it's very robust and quite simple to fix
(for us anyway, we have a lot of experience with the 924 and still have a
lot of parts). But since we're quite new to the tuning part (we only read a
book and have some fancy ideas), we'd love to hear any advice !

We're for example looking for a sports-camshaft, we've heared that it can
make quite a difference, is that true ? Anyone have any experience ?

We have revised the head and placed a ring under each valve-spring to make
it stiffer... is that a bad idea ?

Can we improve the exhaust ?

Anyone know any other way to improve the performance ?

We're already planning on lowering the car as far as possible (within the
budget of 2 students) and since almost everything except the engine and
gearbox is gone, the car already weighs a lot less... It should handle and
corner even better than the standard 924...

Thanks in advance !
