I disagree with what has been posted on street tires for 944/951 newbies.  I
believe that after 3-6 events, a 944 or 951 driver who is committed to maybe
4-8 AX events per year, and maybe some driver's ed/track driving for a period
of 2-3 years will benefit from three simple changes:

Fisrt change: sticky tires.  Either on the "street wheels" if the car isn't
used very much and it is a safe climate for stickies, or on a second set of
used Porsche wheels, if the driver can change the wheels him or herself.  This
is a financial issue.  The rubber is much, much cheaper.  Especially such sexy
tires as S02s.  In our stock sizes, the cost difference can be as much as 2x.
This means the street rubber is PRICEY.  Of course this can also be true of
the 911 and 993 cars.  Like the local owner of a 993 tt who can burn up $200
of S02 rubber in a single AX event!  If the driver is worried about the
longevity of sticky DOT tires, here is a list of common styles from the
poorest wearers to the best:

Goodyear GSCS
Hoosier road race compound
BFG Comp T/A R1
Yoko A008RS road race compound
New Yoko A032?
Toyo Proxes road race compound

This last tire can run through at least a couple of dozen heat cycles.  They
are almost impossible to kill.  As for the wheels, if the person buys the
right ones, they will hold their value.

The second change is to go "plus one" on sway bars.  This increases the wheel
rate enough to make the cars much more fun and instructive.  A set of factory
sway bars can be had for $100 to $250 used, and can be installed by almost any
home mechanic.  Resale vale stays high across the 2-3 year period.

Finally, a proper "mild" competition alignment-- enough to improve handling,
but not cause too much undue tire wear.  Many tire dealers (e.g. Firestone)
will sell a four wheel lifetime alignment.  If you  ask them, they will use
your specs, and will lower the ass end of a 944/951 to the proper height using
the spring plate adjustment.  I have bought such alignments for each of the
944/951 cars I have owned.  I paid $140, and have gone back at least 6-7 times
on each car (at 1-2 hours a pop).  Cost effective.

(For my street/track AX car, I go to a special alignment shop for really
crital work, but the tire places are okay for the newbie.)

I have walked at least 4 newbie local 944/951 colleagues through these simple
steps, and have earned many a pat on the back, and bench racing beer.  These
steps are absolutley transformational, and make the car more instructional
(e.g., how many ways can you teach someone to deal with diabolical
understeer)?

Cost effective fun is the result.
