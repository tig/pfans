I guess I'm guilty of not reading every racing digest as I missed the
beginning of this thread, so forgive me if this is old information:

Wilwood has been selling to racers for some time a system of one-way valves
that allows certain of their calipers (and I would suspect others) to
recirculate brake fluid.  It is called the Dynamic Bleed System and is quite
cheap, although I can't find my price list.  To quote Wilwood (forgive my
typos):  "The WDBS allows small amounts of brake fluid to circulate within a
closed loop system every time the brake pedal is depressed, thereby
eliminating the possibility of localized fluid boiling and build-up of gasses
within the brake fluid (gases end up being vented into the master cylinder
resevoir rather than being trapped within the caliper or brake lines).  The
result is a firmer, more consistent petal throughout the race.  The WDBS
consistes of two one-way valves and a special crossover tube (which replaces
the caliper bleed screws)."

You also have to run a second brake line to allow the fluid  to cycle.  I've
never tried it but they claim they sell it to many NASCAR teams for use a
short tracks.  It looks more like a $50-100 kit than a $10,000 system.
