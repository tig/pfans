Greetings PFans-

The saga of my trans rebuild continues-  Since my last posting I have secured
a 901 trans that has my desired gear ratios (AFMSX).  My current dilema is how
to combine the new trans/gears with my existing setup.  I have a 1971 911
(with 911 gear box with "Pull" type clutch).  I have contemplated retro
fitting my setup with the 901 box, but I am not sure about changing over from
the Pull Clutch to a Push clutch-  Any Clues?  Also, if I do retro fit to the
901 box, I will probably need to keep the 911 differential since the stubby
axel on the 901 box is different (right?).

Always aware of weight, the 901 box is aluminum, heavier than my existing 911
box  (Mag)- Now I know the intermediate plate of the aluminum box is much
stronger, but unfortunately I don't think I can simply swap out intermediate
plates (the mag 911 intermediate plate is thicker).  The direction I am
leaning toward is to take the input shaft from the 901 box (since 2nd gear is
an intregal part of the shaft), take the gears of the Pinion shaft of  the 901
box, and put it all into my 911/mag box with the existing 911 Pinion and
Differential.  

The issue of the pull/push clutch also brings me to the next point and that is
what type of racing clutch is suggested (or is necessary).  If I retain the
Pull clutch setup, does anyone suggest a high performance clutch package (this
is a dedicated race car with about 220hp).  How about the clutch for the push
type setup, are they any better?

As usuall, thanks for all your help.
