    It's easy, Bob:  Just ask yourself, "If Mario Andretti [or
    whoever your favorite pro racer is] were driving my car, would
    he be turning faster lap times than me?"

    So long as the answer's "Yes", you're not getting the most out
    of your existing equipment.

    Of course, most of us will NEVER be as good as Andretti, so you
    might want to lower the standard a little bit by just asking one
    of the fast guys in your class to drive your car... When your
    times are as good as HIS in your car, it's time to upgrade.

    Or, better yet, find someone who owns a more highly-prepared car
    than yours, and ask if you can drive IT.  If you find that your
    lap times in his car would place you higher in his class than
    you're currently placed in your class driving your car, think
    about upgrading.
