Thank you all for your input. Like I said I=27m totally new to the Porsche =
world, performance world no=21 I just picked my performance a bit =
differently.

My intentions for my 911, by Tory M. Blue..

This is going to be a weekend street but mostly time trial car. I would =
like to get into PCA events but unfortunately I don=27t trust many other =
drivers and having one of these people next to me in a corner doesn=27t =
thrill me, okay it does but not the idea of them losing control or have =
them dive into my door cause I=27m about to pass them..

I love both handling and power and as far as I=27m concerned they go hand =
in hand. Your nothing without the other (In my opinion only), just like a =
bodybuilder with bird legs and 58=22 chest. kind of funny.

I was looking at getting close to 300hp out of a motor, but HP is not =
everything, if I can=27t put it to the ground or control it, it doesn=27t =
do me much good. For SoloII I need out of the gate power, Torque, but for =
road courses I need a good wide band.

If I do soloII events then I either A) need to build it to ASP specs (I =
think there is another class like IT or something as well) or go full out =
and go prepared, mod or our local anything goes class, OSP.

Also I=27m sure track events have their own guidelines and I=27ll have to =
do some more research there. In my opinion it=27s really hard to build an =
all around car and have it fit into a variety of classes in the various =
racing orgs and be competitive in each. (If you know how please share).

Money is a factor. I=27m looking at investing maybe =248K into this car, =
so yes I have a budget, will I break out of it? Ya, I=27m sure I will but =
need to start somewhere. For that money I can do quite a bit and would be =
interested in some idears. This is engine, suspension only. I already have =
turbo tie rods and various other things. If you want to point me to some =
places to check out, read, take a peak etc, so I don=27t bore you all with =
questions please feel free to point it out and if your talking compression,=
 cam grinds, carb jetting, CFM etc I can most definately follow ya.


Thanks again and so far I like the feel of these great lists.

Tory M. Blue

IMO, Pano ads overstate most prices by some...25%(?).  This is from a
Southern California perspective, where parts are plentiful; or maybe I=27m
just jaded by swap meet prices.

OTOH, some value must be attributed to an engines heritage and care,
which, in the case of a 3.2, may add as much as =241,000 or more to a
realistic trading price.
