There have been a few posts on the 911 list  related to the following
original post about standing start acceleration.
None really addressed the proper method for a quick start.  I was hoping

the racing list would be a better place to help find a solution.

 Most of the responses on the 911 list related to the 4 wheel drive of
the C4;
however, I had  the same thing happen on my C2S.  A couple of days ago I
was
trying to get a  solid launch from my C2S.  One method I used was
EXACTLY the same method as outlined above.  4 grand, drop the clutch and
full in
on the throttle. (not atypical on certain cars)  The clutch just didn't
grab.   I have the extra wide tires on 18 inch wheels, so I understand
there's a
of a lot torque required; however, I was pretty surprised at the results
considering
Porsche's stated 0-60 times, and various magazine reviews
I've read.  I would have thought that the clutch would hold.

Needless to say, I didn't continue my attempts.  I'm  new to Porsches
and I know trial and error standing starts can get very costly very
quickly.  I figured it best to
ask the experts in the audience.
I'm not looking for drag strip times; nor am I looking to trash the
clutch.
I would like; however, to understand how to get quick standing starts
from my car.  Can anyone recommend the "best" method for quick
standing starts that don't completely torch the clutch?  Thanks.
