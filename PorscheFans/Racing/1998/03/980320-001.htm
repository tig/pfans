Konstantin,

Yes, according the Kelly Moss Racing who has done several of these
conversions, it will fit but you need the shift linkage and axle shafts as
well as the transmission. You will also need to machine an adapter between
the trans and the torque tube (least costly) or replace torque tube and bell
housing (allows easier clutch changes).

Because the ring and pinion are different (944=3.375 vs 968=3.778), here's
the final drive ratios and how they compare:

944 Turbo: 1st-13.61  2nd-9.94  3rd-4.72  4th-3.48  5th-2.79
968 NA:      1st-12.02 2nd-7.55  3rd-5.42  4th-4.19  5th-3.44  6th-2.93

Clearly, the 968 box is not just a highway gear tacked onto the 5-speed, but
offers closer ratios throughout. I've concluded it would be a terrific
conversion and have planned to make the change once I can find the necessary
parts... which hasn't been terribly easy so far.

I had a hard disk crash recently so I lost most of the info, but there was a
major thread going late January/early February on the 924/944/968 list which
you might find interesting -- just check the archives.
