Hey all,

Okay going through my Porsche check list of things that the wrench
found wrong with her before I attained her.

It says trailing arm bushings collapsed. Where is the trailing
arm? I know of A-arm torsion bars etc. but not a trailing arm and
my automotion catalog doesn't have that listed anywhere.

Someone mind telling me what they are talking about and where it
is?

Also I have heard other shops listed that are outside of CA and it
sounds like besides saving tax you get better prices. Anyone want
to share the list of approved shops they have used and are happy
with ? Private Email is fine as I'm sure this subject has been
beat to death.

Thanks again.

Tory M. Blue

Also what is the drivers door check missing pin?

European Auto Works in MV checked it out.

Also does anyone use T&D Performance in Cambell? Most of the work
on this car seems to have been done there.
