Am seeking the collective wisdom on track wheels/tires for widebody 993.
Including Turbo, C4S, C2S.

Leaning toward 18 x 8.5, 50mm ET front and 18 x 11, 44mm ET rear.
Have been told that 9 on front and 11.5 on rear may work.

Hoosier will have R3S03 mid April in 245/35/18 front & 275/35/18 rear.
They will also make a 335/30/18 but it is probably too wide, (designed 
for vipers.) This tire selection is not ideal for two reasons.

	1. The front tires have a .9" shorter circumference which may
	confuse the ABS.

	2. 275's at the rear on 11" rims is not ideal. I have heard that
	Hoosier may offer a 305/30/18 later in the season.

The long awaited G-force from BF-Goodrich won't be around until June or
July.
They will have 245/40/18 for the front and 285/30/18 for the rear. They
also
intend to make 295/30/18.

Dunlop and Pirelli currently make 18" track tires but they are close to
double
the cost of the others.

Any input on wheel size and tire selection is greatly appreciated.
