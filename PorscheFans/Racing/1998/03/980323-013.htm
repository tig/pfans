Jon Lowe wonders about the wisdom and necessity of two of the
upcoming safety rules:  required shoulder harness slots and back
braces.  I am hoping Club Racing will get some dialog going with those
affected.  I could probably be persuaded on both counts (though I
happen to have complying seats on both cars we race because the belts
work better that way).

It is hard to overlook the issue of a seat back brace.  If you stuff it
forward into a wall you have those belts (as long as they don't slip off
your shoulders) doing their job.  But if you spin and hit backwards, or are
stopped on the track and someone hits you from the rear, the picture is
rather different.  The inertia of your body will want to push the seat
backwards.  911 seats typically are held in with 6 or 8 6mm bolts, and a
latch in a track.  How strong are these, really?  More to the point, even if
these resist the shear and tensile loads applied, what about the seat
back?  Will it act as a strong support, or will it collapse backward,
allowing you to shoot like a torpedo out the back window.  The seatbelts
aren't going to do much in the rearward direction.  A year ago we
splurged on a Recaro SPG for the GT4 car.  It is held in with 4 8mm 8.8
bolts which hold the track to the car (I welded in brackets to accept
these 4 bolts, although an adapter worthy of a panzer tank is available),
and 4 more similar bolts which screw into nuts which are encapulated
into the glass (or lighter and more expensive material) the seat is made
of.  Might these just rip out?  I have never had a hankering to perform my
own destructive testing on any of this stuff, so I don't really know what it
will take.   But all in all my sense of things is that the seat is not as
securely mounted as are the seat belts.  

Anyway, SCCA has had some sort of requirement designed to keep the
seat from going backward.  The 1995 GCRs (which I hear may have
been changed in some way concerning seat bracing) required a padded
head  restraint capable of withstanding 200 pounds to the rear (all our
cars with high back factory seats ought to meet this).  In their GT and
Prodution classes (all of which tend to be dedicated full race cars) the
seat itself must have its back "firmly" attached to the main roll hoop or its
cross bracing, to provide aft and lateral support.  Sheet metal structures
of the car which will meet this firm attachment requirement can also be
used.  However, the GCRs don't give a specific performance standard
for any of this.  In Showroom stock (better comparison to our stock
classes) a horizontal piece of tubing of equal dimensions to the roll bar
has to be installed horizontally from the bar to the diagonal brace as a
seat back support, and should not be higher than shoulder height. 
Showroom stock, it should be noted requires a full cage, not just a roll
bar.

For the technically inclined, in 1995 anyway the underlying performance
standard for SCCA cages was 1.5G lateral, 5.5G fore or aft, and 7.5G
vertical, all applied simultaneously.  Multiply the weight of the car and its
loads by these factors and you will get the weights which must be
withstood.

I stayed up way too late last night designing, fabricating, fitting, and
installing a seatback brace for our GT4 car, because I have long known
of the problems in that regard of impacts coming from the rear, and our
seat's back is about a foot forward of the bracing.  However, there are
downsides.  For instance, Kathy and I need different seat positions.  Just
sliding the seat one or two notches does it and is a lot less work (and
the seat does its job better) than always putting in and taking out a pad. 
Plus being able to move the seat backwards is helpful when bitten with
the urge to stand on your head and play with the pedal cluster.   With the
help of a hefty quick release pin I can accomodate that travel, although it
will take two people or an in and out and back in of the car (in the race
car this is the difficulty equivalent almost of a NASCAR car) to release
the pin (can't reach it from within the car), move the seat (have to be
sitting in it - it is stiff), and reinstall the pin in a new hole.  However, if we
decide we don't like sitting 7/8ths of an inch lower and move the seat
back up, I've got to redrill the seatback or the plate which bolts to it.

One way of making getting in and out of a street car with a cage and a
partial side bar easier is to move the seat all the way back.  If the seat
back is locked in place, ?

However, other than screwing up the shift to Snell 90 (it was done in 95,
but no Snell 95s were available until '96!, but the hierarchy may have felt
pressed because previously M 85 was allowed), I don't think we have
been ill served by our leaders over the years.  I took a potshot at the roll
cage specs, thinking that omission of 2.25 inch bar for cars over 2,500
lbs was just a typo perpetuated over the years.  Harry Hall set me
straight on that, saying that they figured that Porsche coupes have
substantial roll protection already, so they decided going to that large
size wasn't needed (whereas SCCA has to assume that some of the
cars there had very little to begin with).

And maybe some genius will figure out an aesthetic and inexpensive
way of adding slots to stock seats.  I'd like to know the data indicating
that without slots you'll come out of the shoulder harness in a bad crash
even if it has worked just fine in two decades of intense driver's ed.  We
all try to avoid being crash test dummies, but as a result we don't know
what doesn't work.  Two hundred pound test cotton webbing would
have worked just fine for me since I first started using seat belts in 1962
because I've never (knock on head) been in a wreck bad enough to need
them, but that does not mean that would be a good idea.  Data may well
be there to support the need for slots and the unwisdom of doing
without.

Anyway, patience.  Jaw with the scrutineer at the next club race.  That's
what I plan to do, as I have to figure out how to deal with the nice SRD in
our Class G car I drive to work.
