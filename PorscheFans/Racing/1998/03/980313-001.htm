Phil, don't take this the wrong way, it's not intended in any way to say
you are a bad driver or anything like that.

I've been autocrossing for a few years now, with this current one being the
most successful.  A word of advice, you can go two ways when you start:
1. Buy everything in site and improve your times using those parts.
2. Don't touch anything and maximise what you currently have, even if it
   may not be optimal.

Both ways have merrit, but the second approach will yield a better driver
in the end.  I got my 944T in Sep. of 96 and stuck on a fresh set of
Dunlop SP8000 tires.  It took me 1.5 years to maximise my street
tires.  I recently switched to the Potenza S-02 and have dropped times
by around 0.5 seconds.  After a few track days and around 4 autocrosses,
I think I've maximized these tires now.  THe next logical step are some
"R" compounds, but that will have to wait until all my karting expenses
are taken care of.

And, as for spinning because of tires, remember that any tire, regardless
of type will allow you to lose traction at the limit.  It doesn't matter
if it's a slick or a street tire, going beyond the limit is going beyong
the limit.

Stick to the street tires (although the D40's would not be my first choice)
and maximize your driving ability on them.  Once you've reached their
potential, move up to race tires.
