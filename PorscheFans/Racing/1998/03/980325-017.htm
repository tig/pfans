The NW Region PCA has tons and tons of really good drivers.  They are all
very respectable people who are mature and understand how things work.
If they felt that you could go on your own, I would trust that crowd.
In that region, you have Scotty White, Bill Buetow, Glen Hernandez,
Darryl Havens, Greg and Jodi Fordahl and tons and tons of really good
drivers that know their stuff.

They likely let you go alone because they felt that you were capable of
driving within your limits and the car's limits.  Now, on the other hand,
if I showed up at that event, they would have an instructor with me the
whole time :)

If you had fun at the event and kept your car together, as well as others
keeping their cars together, then it was a well run event.
