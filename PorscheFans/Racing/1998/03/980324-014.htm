Howdy,

WOW, I had no idea what I was going to start!  But, I'm glad I did, it
brought out a lot of good angles and good perspectives.  I just wanted
to back up a little bit and remind people that my original post was
about using what the driver currently has to maximize their performance
before upgrading the equipment;  I really had no intention of making it
a race tire vs. street tire.  If the driver had "R" tires and was talking
about upgrading sway bars, etc, I would have told him to stick with
the factory bars and just maximize the driver before adding any more mods.

Just for the sake of curiosity, I asked my kart coach about what he thinks
about "R" tires vs. street tires.  He has an interesting point of view.
First off, my coach is Sam O'Young, a very accomplished racer, who used
to be sponsored by Honda and has many national championships behind him;
he feels that for auto-x, a set of "R" tires is a must.  He feels that going
out with anything else is a waste of time.  I argued a bit with him over
why it's a waste of time.  What's interesting is that it's not because
of the grip, but rather because of the level of commitment required to
buy a set of race tires and wheels.  He compared it to when we go kart
racing and we put on our race suits and gloves and all that.  The
mental attitude changes dramatically once the suit is on.  If we had
gone out without any special suit on, the mental attitude would not
be there.  He likes to call it focus.  I thought that was an interesting
angle.

When I asked about track events.  He said, without any doubt, that students
should be put on the track with street tires, the less sticky the better.
Pump up the PSI to 40psi and let the students work up to their potential.
Once there, they will hear the squealing and feel the tire protesting.
I've now spent about 4 hours behind the wheel of my race kart and have
noticed one thing, Sam practices what he preaches.  I've spent three
practice days in the rain on full slicks with a dry setup.  He wants me
to be fully able to hit the apex and carry momentum with as little grip
as possible.  Running on slicks in the rain also exagerates mistakes
which is what he wants to see.  Once I was able to drive the thing at
the lower limits, we started to slowly convert the kart to a rain setup,
still using slicks though.

Anyhow, some food for thought.
