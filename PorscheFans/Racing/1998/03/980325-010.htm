     Hi all:

     I have made alot of improvements in my GT-4S Race Car over the winter.
     One area I have neglected is the suspension.

     This worries me because I was getting too much body roll last season
     and I have added a more powerful engine and more rubber.

     I am running a 275 HP, 2.7 litre motor in a 1900 lb car.  The wheels
     are 9" and 11"s.  The current setup has Weltmeister swaybars (set
     within an inch of the start of the bar) and torsion bars.

     My questions are:

     (1) Is there a big handling gain by installing "Charlie Bars"?  I have
     heard that they cost about $1,200 per set.  Is it worth it?

     (2)  Will tightening up my Koni shocks reduce roll a significant
     amount?

     (3) Is there a big handling gain by going with coilovers?  I have
     heard mixed reviews.  What type should I use?   I have heard good
     things about Bilstein shocks with faulner springs.  Where should I buy
     them?  I have heard that there are some 935 type from suspension kits
     with coilovers (the Racer's group sells a kit)....is it worth the big
     bucks???  Is there a significant weight difference between coilovers
     and torsion bars?

     Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

     Thanks,

     Joe Seminetta
