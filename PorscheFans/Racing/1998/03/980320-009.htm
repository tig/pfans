<<<   Remember, we are talking about new students here.  Not people who 
are progressing and starting to chunk their tires.  Less traction 
means the car will move around more at lower speeds.  My opinion is 
that new students should learn how it feels and how to control it 
before moving on.>>>

I completely agree that novices should try autocrossing with their cars
'as is' with 8-10 lbs more air in the fronts than they normally use to
keep the tires from rolling off the rims if they happen to be very
aggresive types.

But my point was that this should be a big waste of time after a handful
of events for those who really want to compete. If you aren't chunking
street tires then you aren't autocrossing - you are boulevard cruising,
which is fine if that is what you want to do. Every autocross has a
bunch of people who are perfectly happy just being there. I know because
I was one of them.

But for those who want to get with the program, the longer you wait to
transition to R tires and figure out how to balance the car the longer
it will take. I have seen it take some people 8 or 10 years to become
locally competitive and another 5 or 6 years to be nationally
competitive. I have seen others 'get it' in a year or two. The ones who
'get it' fastest are the ones who quickly make the commitment. 

I think the absolutely best way to quickly get people up to speed is to
encourage them to take rides with people who already 'got it'. If they
think the difference is due to the car and they feel comfortable with
the possibility of you ruining their tires, take them for a ride in
their car. You then encourage them to drive 11/10ths after assuring them
that spinning the car is perfectly acceptable social behavior at an
autocross. It is amazing how many people won't spin their cars because
they feel it would be embarrassing. It's like learning how to ski or
ride a bike without falling. It can be done but who has the patience?

IMHO, of course,

Paul Foster
