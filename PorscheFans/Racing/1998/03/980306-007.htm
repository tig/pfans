<I'm installing a fiberglass rear bumper on my 911.  Its fit brings it an
eyelash from the car's B&B muffler, and it actually touches the extension
pipes.  I am worried about what the exhaust heat will to do the bumper itself
and/or its paint.  Anyone know of some sort of heat-shielding tape or other
product that could intervene between the bumper and the exhaust system parts
without looking too awful?>
 
I would not let any hot exhaust parts contact the body. Trim or space the
fiberglass so it isn't touching. The paint on my steel license plate panel
started to bubble after putting together my project car - with a stock muffler
(painted black, BTW). The panel was quite hot to the touch. Why was it hotter?
I don't know. Maybe the black paint on the muffler allowed it to radiate more
heat. As an experiment before changing muffler/heat exchanger colors, I
fashioned a curved heat shield from galvanized sheet metal and attached this
between the muffler and the panel using a length of 1" flat aluminum stock
from the hardware store. The aluminum bracket is held on by the 2 muffler
straps and the sheet metal is screwed onto the bracket. This heat shield
results in the panel now being only warm to the touch. Heaven knows what the
exhaust system heat is doing to the other side of the muffler (the engine). I
don't know if reflective tape pasted onto fiberglass would be as effective.
I'd think you'd want some air space on either side of the heat shield.
