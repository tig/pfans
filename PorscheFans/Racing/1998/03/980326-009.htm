Paul:

Now I'm really motivated!
 
> Regarding the trophies, I do think it encourages people to 'race'.

RACE:(noun) 1. Contest of speed...isn't the "silly trophy" a by-product
of the intention?.Competition advocates the action...the trophy is
merely
the reward...semantics, perhaps...accurate, debatable...opinion, mine.

>In a  DE environment I don't think this is a good thing.

The difference between logical thought and reality...rarely meet when
they
should...especially when emotion is brought into the fold...my point
being
a competive nature seems to "halo" many a Porsche owner (if it didn't
most
of us couldn't afford to be driving them)...it may not be a good thing
but
there's no stopp'n it.

Education promotes intelligent thought and action...it doesn't guarantee
it
....anyone who hasn't felt emotion or competition @ 100 MPH+ on a
backstretch
isn't being completely truthful...This happens all the time in Zone 12
DE's 
ie: Sebring...which by the way (Zone 12) has outstanding and structured
educational events.

 A lot of regions only

Relative as this may sound...my mother taught we quite some time ago
that 
"life was about decisions".

As I stated

Realizing that not all Zones are as profficient as others...should
create an awareness for all PCA members to judge their actions (and
consequences).  This alone is purposeful.

Paul, perhaps I was mistaken about those "silly tropies"...unless of
course, I have confused your intentions again.

I guess ignorance is always lurking cause I couldn't find Unix anywhere!
