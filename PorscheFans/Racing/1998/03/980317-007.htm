   Hey racers and drivers Ed guys.
We will be running a transporter from Seattle down to the Las Vegas PCA club race and Driver Ed. days the 1st,2nd & 3rd of May and have two spots left open on the transporter.

   The Transporter some of you may have seen, it is a 53' X-Winston Cup race car trailer complete with air conditioned lounge lounge, air compressor, full bath, TV/VCR & fridge along with enough room for an extra set of tires and a few tool for each car.

   We will be leaving on 4/22 so you could go down the week before and have your drivers ed car to drive to the IMSA/SPORTS CAR whatever it is today race ;-)

Call me at 800-726-8892 or 253-279-9819 or email me
