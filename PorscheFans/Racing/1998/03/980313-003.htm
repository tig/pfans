I can't say for sure about a carbed 2.4S engine, but with MFI the
supertrapps are OK for autox. 

I have a set of the fairly long stainless steel glasspack supertrapps
that have a flange welded on to bolt to the stock early heat exchangers.
These are 17" long and about $160 each in the Pegasus catalog.
They also make an extra short 10" long one. Mine do stick out
a bit and with my car VERY low will rub leaving steep driveways.

With a 2.4S with MFI they act very weird. I must run all disks (12?)
in order to get good power. If I remove disks I get a severe bog
coming out of slow turns. But with all the disks in it is too
loud for the street or muffled track events (Lime Rock).

The power with supertrapps seems slightly better than the stock 
muffler, though low to mid range torque is probably less. 
But I used the supertrapps mostly to remove a lot of weight 
from the far rear of the car which will outweigh the small torque loss.

Good luck!
