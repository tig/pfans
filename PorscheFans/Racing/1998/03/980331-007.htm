Hi, Fans

I would just like to let you know how happy I am with my wrestling 
shoes ala driving shoes.
 
I have been using wrestling shoes for driving and racing for four 
years now.
 
First I had NIKE Grieco Supreme - now discontinued. Now I am drivng
Reebok Gladiators from Summit Sports (800 890 0528) for USD 32.00.

The wrestlers want the same performance from the shoes that we are 
looking for - Thin flexible sole, no raised heel (helps the guys with 
                     size 13 feet to maneuver them  under the dash)   
                     Tight but flexible fit.

The advantages of wrestling shoes over racing shoes are.
                     They look like regular runners, so no 
                      embarasment when going for a date. Try        
                      to meet her first time in high MOMO racing     
                      shoes. Can be used for everyday driving.

                      They are substantially cheaper than  racing 
                      shoes

                      They have thin rubber sole for wet wheather and 
                       longetivity. 
Depends which type you select, they can be had with wild graphic or 
simple colours with a logo.
