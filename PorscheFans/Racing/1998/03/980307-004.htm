Hello P-Fans
	
	Circle Track MAgazine, had an article on these brake fluid recirculars a few
months ago. I think it said that only NASCAR & CART (indy cars) use them. They
are quite expensive at over $ 10K per car! I think it mentioned that PENSKE
leases these high cost units. Sounds like over kill for the weekend warrior! I
would seek out temperture coatings, ducting and the like, before going this
$$$ route!
