I don't think street tires (good ones anyway) and sticky tires (I really
don't like calling DOT tires 'race tires') handle all that different.
If you look at the performance curves of various tires, as illustrated 
in a number of books (George Anderson's 'Winning, a race car driver's
handbook', Carrol Smith "Drive to Win") you'll see the basic curve is
the same. The area at the top of the curve, where the tires generates
the most grip, is much sharper for a competition tire. However, all
tires grip, grip, grip, as you build up speed, until you exceed the
tire's ability to grip, at which point the tire starts to slide.

Good point. Generally, competition tires run with much smaller slip
angles. If you recognize that, and keep the tire in the good point of
the curve (see the Smith book), then the tire will work well and last
the way it was supposed to. Go beyond that point, which is easy to
do if you don't have a lot of experience, and you won't go any faster,
but you will burn up the tire quickly.

I think race tires are cheaper than street tires. For example,
a 225/50 R1, A008RS, V700, or RA1, will cost around $140. A top
notch street tire, like an S02, Pilot, or P0 will cost a lot 
more than that! And the competition tire will last longer than
the street tire, when driven by a fast driver in dry conditions
(the street tire will overheat and chunk, the competition tire
will just wear).

I agree 100%

Again, I agree 100%. That's the entire purpose of DE. If you want to
race, get a license and race.
