Brian, welcome to wonderful world of autox! :)

As for car setup? Your car is already non-stock by some clubs
definitions. So before you start funneling money into your car, get some
seat time and decide what class or category and in what club you want to
play in. _Then_, start tweaking. Learning the car and how to drive it
will yield better results and faster times thsn most any amount of money
you can invest in the car.

First off, please don't expect to be hauling down trophies your first
time out. Alot of people go out to an autox expecting to kick butt and
be the next Andretti or Schumacher, and in 9 cases out of 10 that's
simply not gonna happen. The people you will encounter in Porsche Club
and the SCCA are going to be some of the best drivers you will _ever_
meet. This skill is developed over years and years. But please, _please_
don't get intimdated by them. Autoxers are an extreemly friendly and
helpfull bunch of folks. Your first few times to a local club event,
you'll probably get more advice and suggestions than you will know what
to do with. 

Don't be afraid to ask questions, hang around the paddock area with the
hot-shoes, ask them if you could go for a passenger ride with them, ask
them if they might ride with you and give some pointers (if the rules in
your club allow it). If you look at your first two years or so as
strictly a very fun learning experience, you will have a whole lot more
fun and may even get hooked for life (I am! :). But if you go in hunting
for a trophy right away, you may very well end up discouraged.

The most important advice, HAVE FUN! :)
