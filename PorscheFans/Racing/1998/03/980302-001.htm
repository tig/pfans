for sale:

1985.5 944
guards red and black leather
116K mi.
interior above average
exterior good paint very good some minor scratches one dent in rear 
mechanically good-very good but needs new ring and pinion and power 
steering rack (would be a really good track car)
have bra and mirror bras
7/8 X 15 fuchs with good tires front and rear...
motor in good condition (exceptionally clean) with new belts rollers 
seals, etc. less than 500mi. ago (still kinda whirrs a bit because 
they have not loosened up)
new battery
sony head unit (or kenwood buyer preference)
have all receipts since i bought the car in august of 96
it has seen a few track days and has been driven like a Porsche not 
gramas grocery getter
aftermarket exhaust (dynomax or Supertrapp could have both if you 
wanted them, dynomax on car supertrapp in garage)
updated large wires and K&N filter (or stock setup or both)

want to get rid of it all, drove a 951 this weekend have to have it, 
loved it.  This car is an eternal project car for which i have 
neither the time nor the money (college and work forces sale, not to 
mention boost gauge!) It would make an excellent track car as the 
interior etc are in good enough condition to make some of your money 
back on...overall condition about average maybe a little above in 
someplaces a little below in others...would consider selling whole 
for parts car as well (i would part it, it is worth about as much as 
it is whole but i dont have the space or time)...

considering any offer over 3000.00
car located in central texas no rust, etc....

matt
it must go soon so i can get the 951 (thanks ben!)
