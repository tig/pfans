Somehow racing@porschefans.com is bouncing back to me.. Let's try
this one.

Okay needing some info from you Porsche Pros. 

I have a 1974 911 Targa that has the dreaded 2.7. Now first and 
formost is this motor all that bad that I can't throw some money

and elbow grease at and make it a performer or would it be more 
advisable to swap it for say a 3.2? 

I'm a very pro Turbo guy and would love to put a turbo motor in 
it. If I was to get a 3.2 motor how much other stuff is required

to get a turbo charger put on it and the rest of the car ready to

accept it. 

I know in past experience it would require a turbo ECU,MAS, 
exhaust manifold, intercooler, CBV(BOV)... 

Heck, if anyone has done a swap from a non turbo motor to a turbo

motor could you drop me some advice? 

Also is $5500.00 a decent price for a low mileage 3.2 ltr non 
turbo motor? 

Before being bonked over the head from a Porsche owner friend of

mine, I was thinking of dropping a 3.8 grand national motor in as

I wanted the turbo, now this idea is not dead just set aside. 

Thanks again...
