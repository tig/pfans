Stuttgart, Germany (DPA)

"Ferry" Porsche, the German automotive engineer who designed the first Porsche
sports car along with his father Ferdinand, has died age 88, the Stuttgart-
based company reported Friday.

A statement said Ferry Porsche died at the Austrian resort of Zell am See.

Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche, known as Ferry, was born on September 19, 1909
as the son of Ferdinand Porsche who designed the Beetle car for the Nazis in
the 1930's.  In 1949 father and son joined forces to develop the Porsche 356
model. It was the first to carry the Porsche brandname and laid the
foundations of the expensive, high-performance range.  This first compact
Porsche was built in Gmuend in Austria before the firm transferred production
to Stuttgart after two years.  Porsche racing cars have gone on to be among
the most successful on the world's racing circuits. Ferry retained the post of
honorary board chairman until his death although the company has been led
since 1992 by Wendelin Wiedeking.  Wiedeking has streamlined production
methods at the Zuffenhausen plant to take the firm back into profit after
three lean years at the beginning of the 1990's. 

Porsche now employs 8,000 people worldwide and expects to sell 38,000 cars in
financial 1997/98 (until July 31).  Overseas and domestic demand for Porsche's
new model and the revamped version of the legendary 911 has seen the company
go from strength to strength in the past few years.

Porsche will be buried privately in Zell am See and an official funeral
service will take place in Stuttgart, Germany.
