For what it=B9s worth, or they call =8Cem =B3street=B2 tires for a reason

It has been interesting to follow the spirited discussion about tire vs. 
tire over the last few days.  A lot of people seem to have THE ANSWER.  I 
felt that perhaps I could add something of value in an area that has been 
notably absent from the melee. As an instructor for 23 years and 
currently chief instructor for Rocky Mountain Region, PCA, I think I have 
some perspective about the issue: Which tires make sense for use by 
novice driving event participants? 

First of all, let=B9s be clear about one thing =AD autocross driving and 
track driving are vastly different pursuits.  Participating in both 
disciplines is important to a driver=B9s growth. There is no question that 
autocrossing is a terrific way to learn about basic handling dynamics and 
to explore,  with reasonable safety, the limits of a car.  Most 
autocrosses, however, never reach the sustained speeds of a track event, 
and they=B9re a whole lot shorter.  In a track event, there=B9s a lot more 
opportunity for brain fade and other things to happen. Autocrosses do 
offer the insurance policy of forgiving mistakes that otherwise could 
have unfortunate consequences, and in doing so help the learning process. 
 By all means utilize autocrossing as a training ground for track 
driving, but please do not mistakenly assume that track driving is the 
same thing on a skinny road.

One of the contributors to this thread made a valuable comment in stating 
that many people show up at driving events with cars that vastly exceed 
their driving skills.  AMEN brother!  Why then is it acceptable to see so 
many cars written off at driving events?  The answer is simple =AD it=B9s 
not.  And it shouldn=B9t be considered a badge of honor. 

The reason that PCA provides instructors at events is to teach students 
to drive their cars quickly and SAFELY.  Under no circumstances should an 
instructor allow a student to drive beyond his/her ability.  This 
includes tandem and solo driving. Safety is our primary function.  The 
racetrack is not an appropriate venue for uncontrolled testosterone or 
egos =AD and it=B9s not the right place to experiment with extremes, 
especially when your experience limits your knowledge of what might 
happen and/or your ability to react appropriately.

Now, for the big question about tires.  Here=B9s my humble opinion. In 
general, street tires behave rather poorly on the track.  Some are better 
than others.  A car equipped with competent track tires is simply safer, 
more fun to drive and makes learning easier than a street tire equipped 
car.  Why would you settle for driving an inappropriately prepared car on 
the track?  I wouldn=B9t want to drive an unsafe car on the track anymore 
than I would want to drive one on the street.  Street tires are called 
=B3street=B2 tires for a reason. 

What about this question of track tires allowing higher speeds resulting 
in potentially bad consequences?  My experience says that it=B9s far more 
likely to see an incident on the track as a result of a potent car 
equipped with street tires than as a result of the same car driven with 
track tires =AD but that=B9s not really the point.  The point is, that your=
 
instructors will help tutor you through the learning process.  They=B9ll 
help you learn to understand how your car behaves under varying track 
conditions, how to deal with different corner types, assess a track to 
determine a strategy for driving it, point out problem areas and help you 
avoid them, and so on. They will help you learn in an evironment that 
will improve your abilities faster that you could possibly accomplish on 
your own.  If they can=B9t, then you need to get some new instructors.

If you can afford track tires, get =8Cem as soon as you can - you=B9ll love=
 
=8Cem.  You=B9ll be glad you spent the money.  If you can=B9t, then spend a=
s 
much effort as possible to prepare yourself and work to ensure that your 
car is safe and competent so that you can work around tires that were not 
designed to provide their best performance on a racetrack.  Remember 
also, that street tires typically cost quite a bit more than R1s (or 
equivalent) and that they will wear out very quickly when used as track 
tires.  Most importantly, learn from those who are trained to help you 
learn well and safely.
