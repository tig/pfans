Yes, there are other modifications you should do. One is to have the case (3rd piece) and oil 
pump cover machined to accept a full flow filter and external oil cooler. CE Engineering does a 
beautiful job of this. Then, you need to install the filter and oil cooler. Did you have the 
intake & exhaust manifolds machined to match to the head ports? Read Duane Spenser's book, the 
356 Perfromance Guide, there's a ton of 356/912 race engine info in it.

Subject: Racing 912 engine
Hello racefans,
 I am in the midst of rebuilding my 912 engine. I am trying to make as many
racing upgrades as possible, while maintaining the beast for mostly street
use. The changes I have made include:
new 1720 NPR P/Cs (Paul Bernardo, CA), new wide-lobe camshaft (WebCam),
ported and polished heads with double springs (Brown and Harding, NC), new
lifters, remachined rods (Brown and Harding, NC), lightened (down to 12.0
lbs from factory 13.5 lbs) and rebalanced flywheel and crankshaft (T-Hoff
Machine Shop, NC), Bosch 050 dist., dual ID40 Webers, K&N filters, and
Roger Bursch exhaust.

Are there any other updates that can be made, keeping with a streetable
format, before reassembly (by Chuck Miller, Millersport, NC)? Any pointers
to keep it running as long as possible without blowing up?  How long should
this engine configuration last (street use)?
Thanks,
Keith Killian
