	Folks,

	There have been a number of questions lately about recording
video at the track.  Here's a blurb on my experience.

	First of all, I record a lot of in-car video.  Actually, I
always run with a camera whether it be autocross, drivers ed, or club
racing.  This translates into at least 60 hours of tape and camera abuse
each year.  It's an excellent educational tool never mind how much fun
to watch.  I've tried several different setups starting with the glass
suction type mount, then the I/Oport cage mounted setup, and finally the
ultimate remote head setup.

	The suction mount setup is (IMHO) marginally OK for
autocrossing.  You get shake but no real harsh vibration.  I would not
recommend this for the track.  I don't think you'd pass tech with it
anyways.  Even if you did you'd be taking a chance that your camcorder
will pass you under braking.

	The next setup I tried, the IOport type mount, worked great for
some time but had one major draw back for me.  It destroyed cameras.  If
you don't do much track time or only drive incredibly smooth tracks and
never go off and never hit the curbs then this would probably be just
fine for you.  If you're like me and do go off *occasionally* and do hit
the curbs sometimes and best of all, get to drive extremely rough tracks
like Bridgehampton (long live the Bridge!) then you WILL eventually
destroy your camera.  Think about it.  You've got a precision piece of
equiment bolted directly (effectively) to the chassis.  If you've got
heavy springs and hard bushings it's even worse.  I've destroyed two
camcorders using this setup.  They were repairable (which I did) but
once they broke they continued to require repair for one thing or
another.  The mount should be attached to a roll bar or cage.  I did try
it for a while attached to a harness bar (before I had a full cage) but
that really didn't work too well because the bar tended to vibrate.
Depending on your suspension setup this may work OK for you.

	For both setups that I've described so far I found it best to
turn OFF the "steady shot" feature.  Those mechanisms seem to be
designed for the rythmic sort of shake that humans hands and arms tend
to produce.  The steady shot features on the cameras I've used (all were
Sony) were no match for the vibrations produced under track conditions.
Besides, the electronic stabilization systems (as opposed to mechanical
systems) actually reduce captured image resolution.

	The third thing I tried is a remote camera head (2x2x3.5 inches)
that connects to the "video in" connector on my camcorder.  The unit is
made specifically for in car use on the track by a company called
RaceCam (http://www.racecam.com).  The quality of the image is
unbelievable!  It's just like what you see on ESPN or Speedvision; NO
VIBRATION, NO TAPE TRACKING ERRORS, PERIOD.  The unit comes with a
serious mount that attaches to your roll bar or cage and also includes
the microphone (which attaches to the audio in connector on your
camcorder).  You also get a padded bag for your camcorder.  I strap the
bag to the floor behind the passenger seat.  I've also strapped the bag
into the harnesses on the passenger seat.  Since I've been using this
setup I've had no camcorder problems.  More importantly, the video is
awesome!  Another cool feature of these camera's is an electronic filter
that you adjust for your car that allows more light in below the top of
your "dash".  The net result of this is you can read your guages while
not experiencing glare through the windshield.  Another thing I've done
is move the camera head to positions that you cannot normally do with a
camcorder such as the foot well, passenger side cage A pillar, etc..
Makes editing more fun when you have different angles to work with.

	Regards,
	Mark
