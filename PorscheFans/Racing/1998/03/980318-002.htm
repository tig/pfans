1. Buy everything in site and improve your times using those parts.
2. Don't touch anything and maximise what you currently have, even if it
   may not be optimal.>>>>

I'd add another option:

3. Get a proper set of tires.

in the end.  I got my 944T in Sep. of 96 and stuck on a fresh set of
Dunlop SP8000 tires.  It took me 1.5 years to maximise my street
tires.  I recently switched to the Potenza S-02 and have dropped times
by around 0.5 seconds.  After a few track days and around 4 autocrosses,
I think I've maximized these tires now.  THe next logical step are some
"R" compounds, but that will have to wait until all my karting expenses
are taken care of.

Stick to the street tires (although the D40's would not be my first
choice)
and maximize your driving ability on them.  Once you've reached their
potential, move up to race tires.>>>>

Farzaan, I have to disagree with you on this one. I personally think
that if you are really interested in competing in autocrossing that any
time you spend on street tires is almost completely wasted. Why? Because
you are radically changing the characteristics of the car. The
difference between the BFG R1 and _any_ street tire is night and day.
Besides, full tread street tires are very likely to be torn up due to
friction and the large tread blocks.  My advice to any but the most
casual autocrosser would be to get a second set of wheels and get the
R1s, or the Kumhos, or even the Toyo proxies as soon as you possibly
can. Another alternative is to simply drive all the time on the R1s. You
won't get more than 5000 miles from a set of unshaved tires, but it
alleviates the problems associated with changing and storing the other
set of wheels.

IMHO, of course,

Paul Foster
