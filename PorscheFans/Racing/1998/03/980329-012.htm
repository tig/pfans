Jim Selden complained about the event at SIR March 21.  Obviously Jim
knows everything there is to know, but as the Course Marshal for the
event, I have a different viewpoint.  
1. This was the first event of the year with an all new crew including
registration.  Nevertheless, the gates opened on time at 7am and over 100
cars were processed and teched by 8:15 in time for the drivers meeting at
8:30.  
2.The first cars were on track at 9am sharp which is the earliest time
allowed by SIR.  The only breaks in track usage were 45 minutes for lunch
so we could let the corner workers eat(they are paid so paying customers
do not have to work corners)and some brief timeouts when we had to send
out the tow vehicle. We stayed very much on the printed schedule
all day. As soon as one group finished a session, the next group, which
was already in the hot pits, was sent out--no downtime at all. We don't
use the PA system due to lack of access and manpower.  
3.Moving off line on a straight to let faster cars by is not unusual. All
the local clubs do it that way. Since this is not street driving, we do
not use turn signals for any purpose other to signal let-bys. You do not
signal to move back into line--you use your mirrors and do so when clear,
just like the big boys.
4.We have limited numbers of instructors and try to use them as
efficiently as possible.  The swapping out for first timers allows us to
have as many newbies served as possible.  
5.Being out here in the free and individualistic West, we do not believe
in holding people back.  We judge ontrack behavior and counsel those who
need it.  Moving up to higher groups does require higher and higher levels
of ability.  Whether you do that on your own or with our instructors is
left to the individual driver.  We had two complete teams of drivers from
the club at Daytona this year with one team finishing on the podium in
GT3!
All of them started with our DE and sharpened their skills at SIR.  
6.We are known as the strictest club in the area--most of the rest do not
have structured ability levels or let the driver pick the group to run in.
I have been to Portland many times and it's a lot more loose than anything
we do here.  

So Jim, and any other unhappy entrants, just chill a little and get used
to our ways.  We don't really care how you did it back east(or in
California) is the unofficial Seattle motto.
