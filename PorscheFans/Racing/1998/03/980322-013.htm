At the risk of perturbing those who may be thinking "enuf already with this
thread," 
I think there's an important point here for novices considering entering a
track event.  My interest stems from organizing and instructing at driving
schools, and from teaching a car control clinic for new drivers.  There's no
doubt that a well setup car on sticky tires is easier to drive fast than a
sloppy car on hard street rubber.  It also seems clear that there's no sense
in having novice drivers wrestle with evil handling, poorly setup cars.  But
that's not really the issue, as I see it.  

The issue is that more and more novices are showing up at track events with
cars whose limits far exceed their skills.  That's not a problem as long as
the driver stays within those limits, and doesn't do or encounter something
unexpected. 
Let me propose two points for consideration:
--The circumstances that lead to an accident are different from those of
lapping within the handling limits of the car. 
--On the track, major accidents stem from minor incidents (e.g., dropping a
wheel off the track, lifting abruptly at the limit, etc).

As long as events are unfolding as expected, the student's "conscious mind" is
in control.  (So yes, the more predictable the car's behavior and the higher
its limits, the better -- so far, so good).  However, when something
unexpected happens requiring split-second reactions, the "conscious mind"
punches out.  Reactions to the event will then be determined by practiced
behavior (if there is any) or instinct (if there isn't any practiced behavior
to fall back on).  The instinctive reaction will be something akin to "flight
or fight" -- abrupt lift; hard countersteer; hammer the brakes; etc.  Any of
those reactions will turn a minor incident into a major problem.
On the other hand,  those of you who have experienced and practiced reacting
to something like a dropped wheel will maintain an even throttle and gradually
ease the car back onto the track.  You 911 drivers who start to lose the rear
end in a turn will apply throttle.  Neither of these reactions are instinctive
or intuitively obvious.  You only know to react in those ways because you've
experienced the situation and practiced the response.
The problem, then, is that inexperienced drivers in high performance cars on
sticky tires can reach very high speeds before they get into trouble, and they
don't sense they're getting into trouble until it's too late because of the
competence of the car  and the break-away characteristics of track tires.  In
experienced hands, the car's abilities and the tires' grip will, indeed, help
the driver out of trouble.  However, no car or tires can make up for the
inappropriate reactions of an inexperienced driver.  

The bottom line is this:
--drivers need to experience and practice reacting to "outside the envelope"
situations before they attain the extreme track speeds modern performance cars
are capable of, especially on track tires.
--suggestions for getting such experience include practicing in empty parking
lots,  skidpad training, autox, and seat time on the track with street tires,
which have more predictable behavior and lower break-away limits.
--instructors need to be careful about assuming that a driver who is handling
a car competently within its limits will also react competently in an
emergency. (Think about it from the persective of practiced behavior -- lap
after lap of in-control driving inspires confidence and speed, up to the point
where the driver brakes too late, misses an apex, or drops a wheel and has to
deal with a high-speed emergency for the first time, with no practiced
behavior to fall back on.)
--any track driver who hasn't practiced maintaining or regaining control in an
emergency should leave a safety margin (eg, a few feet of road at the track-
out point) and seek out opportunities to repetitively practice car control
techniques.  Warning -- it's not sufficient to understand what you SHOULD do
in these situations (remember what happens to your conscious or "thinking"
mind); you need to know for sure how you WILL respond, and that you can only
know through experience.  Get that experience at slower speeds and in safer
environs before you end up in a little metal ball against the guard rail.
