<< Circle Track MAgazine, had an article on these brake fluid recirculars a
few
 months ago. I think it said that only NASCAR & CART (indy cars) use them.
They
 are quite expensive at over $ 10K per car! I think it mentioned that PENSKE
 leases these high cost units. Sounds like over kill for the weekend warrior!
I
 would seek out temperture coatings, ducting and the like, before going this
 $$$ route!  >>

Your wrong here. The brake recirculators that the circle track guys use are
cheap. They consist of some extra plumbing, and some special one way valves. 

All thats really going on is that the hot fluid from the calipers is allowed
to return to the brake fluid resevoir. No magic or trick parts required. This
system works great on heavy, high horsepower cars.

Go look at the page 38, in the April Circle Track.
