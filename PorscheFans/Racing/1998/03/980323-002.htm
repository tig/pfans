Hello,

I just got back for a sub-par weekend at Thunderhill.  First, on Saturday
the track was fairly wet, and it continued to rain on and off for the
remainder of the day.  Luckily, the rain stopped early in the morning and
track conditions became fairly good early in the morning.  Things were
beginning to look good.  Unfortunately in my second run I noticed a serious
power drop in my 951.  The first thing I assumed was that I was not
boosting.  But according to the factory gauge I was producing full boost,
and I could feel the boost coming on in mid-throttle acceleration.  I
babbied the car back to the pit.  I then packing things up and drove all
the way home 200 miles.  

Things I noticed:
When a WOT the car seems to looses power from 3500-4500 up to red-line.
The car doesn't feel rough, drives perfectly with light to middle thottle
conditions.  It is hard to describe how the car feels when this condition
emerges except to explain that it feels similar to car that isn't
boosting...  To me, it feels like the DME is "killing the fun"....

Things that have been already done:
Oxygen Sensor

Possible causes:
Bad Tank of Gas (Thunderhill gas 92 octane)
Plug wires
Fouled Plugs
Or?????

I want to try to figure this out myself (if possible).

Mike, give me a call if you get a chance....


TIA,
