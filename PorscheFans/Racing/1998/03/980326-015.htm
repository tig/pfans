Jeff Fortenberry asked how you know what part of the roll cage to pad.  
A couple of years ago, Circle Track magazine, which excels on race car 
engineering how-to's, had an interview with Dr. Terry Trammel, who has 
done surgery on a lot of Indy car drivers.  His advice was (and I 
paraphrase, but pretty accurately) "pad everything your head, arms and 
legs could make contact with in a crash".  He went on to say that a lot 
of drivers break their hands, wrists, legs, etc. because they bang 
against a hard surface in a crash.

I've put my money where Dr. Trammel's mouth is--i.e., I've padded my 
roll cage in accordance with his general advice.  You can pad what you 
wish to.

One other thought.  An earlier edition of Circle Track mentioned 
that there is a type of roll cage padding (generally referred to as 
NASCAR padding) that deforms instead of rebounds, and is supposed not to 
melt and drip in case of a fire.  Dave Turner Motorsports can supply it. 
He's listed in the index of Pano.  Makes sense to me.

Just my $.02 worth.
