Sorry about the wrong phone in my "for sale" post.

Thanks for the great response!   It is corrected as followes:


I CAN'T KEEP ALL OF MY TOYS!

1972  911S, White w tan leather.  "No sunroof, no power windows". Factory
remote oil cooler.  Motor and transmission is being rebuilt as you read
this by a dealer trained Porsche specialist. Motor with new factory 2.4S
P&C's, valves, guides, chains, sprockets, bearings, etc.. Also using SC oil
pump, time-serts,  Carrera tensioners, MFI pump rebuilt by Pacific Fuel
Injection, and SSI heat exchangers. Transmission being rebuilt w stock
ratios but w SC main shaft & 930 1st 2nd slider for strength.  I just
bought on impulse from family that owned for 21 years. Solid and stock with
great club race or collector potential! $19,000. An excellent & fun
investment. 

1972  911- 2.8 twin plug w MFI. Elgin high lift "S" cams and factory RSR
pistons. Cylinder spacer kit to run on street gas. Modified S distributor w
twin plug cap. Just re-ringed  & valve job on low mile 7R case motor. C2
remote oil cooler & mini battery. Transmission just rebuilt w stronger SC
main shaft ,  930 sliders, limited slip, & new RS all aluminum sport
clutch. Rebuilt Carrera 3.2 brakes w SS lines. All new suspension: 22/28
torsion & 22/22 sways, poly bushings, ball joints, turbo tie rods. Alloy
front cross member, alloy rear arms, Bilstein Carrera shocks & struts.
Original clean white paint & black interior. Low mile stock body with S
trim. This one year car project  just about finished. Your wheel choice of
Minilites w new 225R1's or polished Fuchs for a "Vintage Race" or  "Stock
Sleeper" look!  Just $13,000 would cost twice this to have built.

TRADE CONSIDERED  (Need A/C):
May trade up or down for 911 Targa (SC/Carrera) or 76-89 930.  Also can
trade my MBZ 190E w 5 spd that I bought new.

 73 RS front & rear light weight (race weight) bumpers apx 5 lbs each. Take
40+lbs off you car. Rear also works with or with out SC flares (1969+).
