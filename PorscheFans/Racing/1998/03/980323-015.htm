 It is hard to overlook the issue of a seat back brace.  If you stuff it
 forward into a wall you have those belts (as long as they don't slip off
 your shoulders) doing their job.  But if you spin and hit backwards, or are
 stopped on the track and someone hits you from the rear, the picture is
 rather different.  The inertia of your body will want to push the seat
 backwards.  911 seats typically are held in with 6 or 8 6mm bolts, and a
 latch in a track.  How strong are these, really? >>

This is all well and good, except I drive a 914 with the seat hard against the
firewall.  Where do I put the brace?  I could just put a bolt through the
seatback and firewall!  And even though SCCA club racing has required seat
braces for awhile, as late as 1987 they did not in the Pro Series (I've got a
1987 Escort 944 Turbo to prove it!).  Today's street cars have to meet pretty
strigent government rules for seat strength, including rear impact.  Are the
rules being written for the older cars? Have there been real world incidents
in PCA Club racing where seats failed?  If so, what were the circumstances?
And this "Dedicated race seat"; what is it?  Does it have to have any sort of
approval (SFI)?  What about vintage plastic Porsches with lay down seats with
no room to put a new seat? Are they now excluded from racing?

I guess my problem is that this was done with no explanation of why, and then
published with no indication of what will be legal.  It also bothers me that
they are attacking things like this and important matters like making sure we
have Club Racing logos on our cars (I do already) without apparently working
other issues such as getting consistent timing and scoring at the races.
Sebring's T&S was the worst I've EVER seen; late, missed laps, wrong classes
even after three attempts to get them to get it right, missing cars, etc.

Anyway, I guess I needed to get this off my chest.  I worried that Club Racing
is going to go the way of SCCA, with ever increasing rules and costs.  I hope
I'm wrong.
