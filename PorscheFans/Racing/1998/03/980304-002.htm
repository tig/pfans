Mike:

The 88 951S, 89 951, 944S2 and 968 all came stock with this type of brake 
cooling.  The parts from the dealer are only about $60 (4 pieces @ $15 ea.) 
 They get their cooling air from under the car, not through the nose of the 
968.  All 85.5 and later 944's came with the mounting tabs for these 
cooling scoops on them.  Most of the 944 club racers in this region are 
using these inexpensive scoops as they are very effective and inexpensive. 
 As the Cool Brake kit costs in the range of $250 and requires a 
substantial amount of labor (relative to the scoops) to install (you have 
to remove the fog lights and install the Cool Brake ducting as well as 
removing the rotors and backing plates so as to install the Cool Brake 
backing plates,) IMHO the factory scoops are the most cost-effective 
street/track solution to brake rotor cooling.
