Hello Sam,

Are these going to be the only tires on the car? Do you have to drive the
car every day? Do you ever want to drive the car on the street? Will you
be driving the car to events? How important is tire wear to you?

Here is a list of 'sticky', or DOT legal competition tires that I know of:

Manufacturer	Tire
------------------------------------
BFG		R1, G-Force (due ???)
Yokohama	A032R, A008 RS
Kuhmo		Victorracer V700
Toyo		Proxes RA 1
Goodyear	Eagle GS CS
Hoosier		(I forget the model)

Assuming you need to drive the car on the street, the Hoosiers
are out. They are very light, but don't have belts, and are very
prone to puncture. The Goodyear's are VERY fast, probably the 
fastest, but they are also the most expensive (over $200) and
don't last very long. That leaves the BFG, Yoko, Kuhmo, and Toyo.
For those, it's pretty much whatever you like. I've driven them
all (except for the A032R, and the Kuhmo, but I have the Kuhmo's
in the basement and they'll be on the car soon). For personal
reasons I don't like BFG. I've had very good experience with the
Yoko A008 RS, but those may be tough to find. 

Expect to pay around $130 a tire. Depending on your driving style
and car, you can get anywhere from 5 - 20 track days on them.
