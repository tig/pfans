Guys,
I just read parts of the "tire tread" regarding beginners and hot setups,
etc...I couldn't agree more with Serpe's comments on starting with basics
and "making do with what you've got".

I recently attended a drivers school for vintage racing.  I showed up with
my 914 street car which is well-maintained and slightly upgraded in various
areas (like Bilstein HDs all the way around for shocks, harness bar and
harnesses, etc)

Anyway...since I'm pouring all kinds of money into several other resto
projects, I haven't YET put very fancy, high-perf tires on the 914.
Currently I have some generic ( read cheap) beetle-spec tires on it.  I
went into this school knowing full well that I am here to learn THE LINE
and not to go fast or try to impress anyone with the equipment.  Well
folks, I got out on the course and that car  was SO LOOSE..I had absolutely
no grip, no adhesion so speak of...I actually got pretty good at coming out
of turns, gas full on, in a full drift to the outside edge-lotta fun.  I
only spun once the entire weekend (rather proud of that fact) but I was
always pretty close to that edge...The good news is, I was never considered
a threat to any of the other, probably much more experienced, drivers and
students on the course.  I never once got a waving black flag
(warning)...bunch of other folks did though.

My point? my point is I honestly think its' a better education when you
start with a tire setup such like mine, with the feeling that you are
driving on greased BBs... you learn and you pay attention real fast.  You
get much more sensitive to what it takes to get around the course
effectively and it (no pun intended here) really sticks with you.  So,
"make do with what you've got" and don't get too caught up in having the
latest and greatest when you're starting out (like I am).  Equipment
upgrades will come later.  This way, I think you get more out the
experience than showing up in a new Twin Turbo. (which to me is like trying
to learn basic photography while using a high-end Nikon...you'll  NEVER get
as good as the gear you're using).

BTW-for anyone contemplating getting into any track activity on the cheap
(oxymoron...) A basic 914 is a good platform to work with...I was pretty
impressed with it.  I'll be back..with new tires? maybe.

Just my .02...thanks for the airtime
cheers
Thom Kuby
