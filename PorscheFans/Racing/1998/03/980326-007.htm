Hello Micheal,

Me too.

Nice car, nice way to take advantage of it.

So after TWO days of track driving, you were set free to drive by
yourself? Wow, that's kind of quick. I'm not saying it wasn't warranted.
Just that it seems to be a very short period between your first track
experience, and being able to drive on the track at high speed without
instruction. I'm not going to second guess anyone from here, and IMHO,
attitude is more important than ability, when it comes to driving solo.

As long as you are aware of other cars on the track, and can operate
your vehicle in a safe manner, you don't NEED instruction. Of course,
if you want to learn more, and want to learn how to operate your
car faster, then instruction is a great idea.

As an instructor and officer (secretary) with Metro, I'm sorry 
to hear that. I wasn't at the Pocono event, so I can't comment on 
you particular experience. I can comment on some items though.

It seems to me like you should have been moved up into a faster group.

I don't know what lap times have to do with anything. This is driver 
education, not racing or time trialing. As long as you operate your
vehicle in a safe manner, and don't hold up people, lap times just 
don't matter.

Good point. The more closely matched the cars are in speed, the easier
it is on everyone.

Well, if you were intimidating the slower cars in the run group, 
something was wrong. Perhaps you should have been moved to a faster
run group, or perhaps you should have just slowed down. The purpose
of DE is for everyone to have fun, not just to hot shoe it around
the track.

Again, I'm sorry to hear that, and as I wasn't there, I can't comment.
I do know that I've run a LOT of events with Metro over the years,
as well as events with a number of other regions (Conn Valley, Reisentoter,
Hudson Valley). They all seem pretty much the same to me. It's difficult
when you run with a new group, as they don't know you and you don't
know them. I remember the first event I ran with CVR. I had just received
my turbo S, and my instructor was a little nervous about riding with me.
The first session, he wanted me to brake BEFORE the first braking marker.
After a few laps, I realized I could brake much later than that, but I
didn't want to scare him. After the first session I explained that I 
could feel what the car was doing, and that I was firmly and comfortably
in control. I told him that I was going to start driving harder, and that
if I or he felt the car starting to reach the limits, we'd communicate
that to the other. It worked much better that way. I don't blame the
nervous instructor on CVR, it's just that he never met me before, and
didn't know anything about my ability.

Just be aware of what you're getting into. Your insurance is most likely
voided at any event featuring "Timed Runs." It doesn't necessarily make
the event any more dangerous, just that if something bad happens, like you
blow a hose, slip in your own coolant and smack the wall at a timed event,
it's your nickel. If the same thing happened at a straight driver ed 
event, your insurance would most likely cover you.

In any event, the purpose of driver education is not to run for speed,
but to be able to drive your car the way it was meant to be driven. If you're
"an aggressive driver on the edge" please do yourself and us a favor, and
stay away from future Metro events. That's not the kind of driver we want
at our events.
