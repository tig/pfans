Hey all,

Been fun watching the threads about prepped or non prepped cars
for the beginner. I could of sworn this started out as race tires
vs street tires but it's fun to see it evolve.

I actually ran my first soloII season on street tires, I think it
taught me a great deal more then starting out on R1's.. But boy
the car with the R1's is so fun :)

Okay to my question.

Is there a page or two out there with good start points in regards
to getting your early model 911 ready for time trials? Front and
rear camber, caster, toe. Front bars, rear bars, torsion bars etc?
 I know my eclipse was a push freak so I did everything I could to
stiffen the back and loosen the front up, helped a lot. But just
not sure where to start on my 911.

I know currently i'm having some severe bump steer and am thinking
about getting the kits from automotion that will space my rack up
so it sits even once again. 

My 911 is lowered already, running konis and have the turbo tie
rod upgrade. Next I want to get a bigger rear sway bar and redo
all the bushings in the car. I don't know too much about torsion
bars so I need to do some research and see what they actually do.

With my Eclipse I didn't worry about the front bar since I didn't
want to push anymore. Is the Porsche the same way? Leave the front
alone or does adding a bigger front bar actually help rather then
induce more understeer?

I'm running 205/55/16 in the front with 245/55/16 in the rear. Can
the 74 front end fit 225's ? The rear is updated with fender
flares but consider it a narrow body.

That's it for now, pointers well appreciated.

Thanks again

Oh another question, any one out there with a 4 point race bar in
their targa? Can you tell me how much it affects the movement of
the drivers seat, I'm 6' and like a lilttle bit of recline in the
stock highback powered seats (although those are coming out soon).
