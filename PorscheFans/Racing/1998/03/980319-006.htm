Hi All,
   This debate will go on and on.  The question is not whether a new 
student will go faster on sticky tires or not.  Of course they will.
   The question is whether or not they should.  Should a new student 
learn how to handle a car at a higher rate of speed or at a slower 
pace?
   Sticky tires will mask alot of bad driving habits that street 
tires will not.  With less traction, a student is forced to learn 
more about car control.  I have had students make mistakes on 
sticky tires and have had to try and explain to them that even though 
we made it, you should not do it that way (I concede the point that 
we made it because the tires made up the difference).  It is harder 
to teach technique if the student cannot feel the difference.
   Remember, we are talking about new students here.  Not people who 
are progressing and starting to chunk their tires.  Less traction 
means the car will move around more at lower speeds.  My opinion is 
that new students should learn how it feels and how to control it 
before moving on.

Thanks,
Dodge
