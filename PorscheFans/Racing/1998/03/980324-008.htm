I had an 89 Turbo street car.  It had the symptoms you described, having
developed them just prior to selling the car.   I sold it to someone I knew
and told them that I thought the fuel filter was clogging as this had been
the case once before.  Check that first.  As it turned out, they chased this
problem for quite a while before finding out that the catalytic converter
had become clogged.  A new cat solved the problem.......
