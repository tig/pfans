Folks - 
Get real.  We have had seatback failures in Drivers Ed and PCA Racing.
These failures have occurred with factory seats (86 911) and full race
seats (Recaro SPG).  Both failures I personally witnessed involved heavy
rear impacts, one into a guardrail at Watkins Glen and one into the wall
of NASCAR 1 at Pocono.  Both impacts could have been better
handled/survived with a rear seat brace.  In the case of the stock
seats, the seatbacks for driver and passenger(!) both bent back to 45
degree angles.  The Recaro seat was ripped from its mountings and
allowed the driver to move about the cabin and strike body parts on the
interior. This only makes common sense - a lever arm (the seat) fixed at
only one point (the floor) and having a large moment applied to the
other end of the arm (top of the seatback) will experience a very large
bending force.  If you can provide another attachment point halfway (or
higher) up the lever arm you dramatically reduce the bending force.  
 While we can fault PCA Racing rules makers for providing no spec for
achieving this requirement, we cannot fault them for requiring it.
IMHO, we have been extremely lucky that incidents like Mike Keller's
have not happened to more people.  Lets step up and face the music -
when you play in life threatening sports, you better take some real
precautions.
