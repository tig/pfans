There's a lot to be said for getting out and tossing a car around to 
find out what it's limits feel like at a much lower envelope (re: skid 
cars with casters). As a kid I would take the Morris Minor 1000 out on 
the dirt or snow covered roads to feel how the balance felt when it 
broke away.  The speeds are lower as well as the risks.  When I got up 
into the Minis and then Porsches it was always valuable to initially 
find out where the car's balance was, but only first off, then it was 
find the twisty roads and kick it out! There is no substitute for a well 
equipped and set up car, but for a first timer don't they put you out in 
a skid car and try to teach you to handle artificially low limits? 
Just a thought.
