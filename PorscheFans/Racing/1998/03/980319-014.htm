Guys, here's the deal with kill switches.

First, it is kind of a misnomer.  What you (I, in any case) want from this
switch is A) turn off the engine, and B) disconnect the battery so there
aren't any live wires in the car which can cause sparks after you have
done two barrel rolls and a pirouette along the top of a guard rail and
chewed up heaven knows what.  Plus be sure electric fuel pumps are
off, etc etc.

And this is what the club race rules require:  "The switch must
disconnect the battery from all circuits except electrically operated
on-board fire systems, and must shut off the engine while it is running
well above idle speed."  

So a substitute ignition only switch won't get you through tech.

So how to make the switch do its job?  Actually, the directions which I
have always gotten with the switch (made by Merit, a German
company?) are adequate.  However, here is the theory:

There are 3 switches on this thing.  The two big screw terminals are for
the big battery cable, and that's one switch.  Then there are two more 
switches which are electrically isolated.  Turning the battery switch off
turns one of these off, and the other on, and vice versa.  You need to
identify which is which.

To the switch which turns on when the battery is turned off you connect
a wire from the big terminal which is not directly connected to the battery
(call it the alternator side) to one of that switch's terminals.  To the other
side of that small switch you connect the resistor to ground. (or you
could use the resistor to connect the alternator side to the switch -
doesn't matter).  When you kill your engine (I'll get to that) the alternator
keeps pumping out juice until the engine stops.  If that juice has nowhere
to go it can go backwards through the diodes or something similarly
undesireable and ruin them.  Allowing it to run through the resistor to
ground makes things look like business as usual to the alternator and all
is well (you EE s out there stop cringing - If Joe was one he probably
wouldn't be asking).

This resistor isn't really all that fragile.  However, I like to add on some
more insulated wire so I can secure it someplace and it can't get banged
around.  If a lead breaks and you use the switch to kill the engine, it is
fried diodes ville, or so we are cautioned.

What about the "kill" feature?  Well, you can't stop the engine just be
disconnecting the battery.  Why not?  Because the alternator is putting
juice into the system.  That's why if you can push start a car with a dead
battery you can usually drive it.  And the clever rules writers require that
the test be done above an idle just to make sure the alternator is doing its
thing.  In a 911 (Joe, you didn't say what car you have) the alternator
connects to the big cable directly from the battery to the starter.  If you
disconnect the battery cable at the battery, the juice from the alternator
will flow to the starter connection back to the battery connector, and
then by the smaller wires connected to the same positive connector back
to your ignition and then on to the coil, fuel pump, and other stuff.  How
to deal with this?

Here the other small switch comes into play.  What you want to do is run
a wire controlling something vital through this switch.  This is the switch
which turns off when the big battery switch also turns off.  In a CIS
engine a good wire for this purpose is the fuel pump relay solenoid wire. 
When the fuel pump solenoid coil doesn't get juice the contacts which get
the amperes to the fuel pump open, the pump stops, and the engine
stops - immediately.  And there isn't much current running through this
coil circuit.  

I don't know how quickly a Motronic stops when you cut off the fuel
pump.  Obviously a carbureted car can run for quite a while, so this
won't work there.

Ignition is the other obvious thing.  If you run the wire which comes from
the ignition switch and goes to the coil or the CD box and gives it its juice
through this switch, then the kill switch will work.  No juice to the coil, no
va.  I don't recall if the manufacturers of these switches are kind enough
to tell us the current carrying capacity of the little switches - I kind of
think they don't.  However, my experience is that they are up to it - for a
while I ran an entire Electromotive twin plug six coil system through this
switch and it worked fine.

So there you have it.  Don't ask me which color wires from exactly
where do what, though.  Someone more saintly or who made a careful
diagram will have to give you that if you lack a wiring schematic.

If you have a 911, a tip on how you can reduce some of the brain
damage.  You can purchase at Checker or Autozone or the like some
fake battery posts which have threaded holes in them.  These you can
screw onto one of the threaded studs on the kill switch.  The threads
don't really match, but they are close enough and these posts are soft
metal and it will go on well enough and far enough to be solid.  Take your
cable off of the battery and attach it to this bake battery post on your
switch.  Now you can get a short battery cable from the same store with
a nice ring lug on one end, and a standard battery positive connector on
the other.  This connects the battery to the switch.  You haven't had to
cut your factory battery cable.  

I took a bracket from my metal bits junk box and welded it onto part of my
strut brace end plate on the driver's side in my '77 911, and attached the
kill switch to this bracket.  The stock battery cable reached up to this just
fine.  The pull wire (I just used a piece of insulated electrical wire - see
diagram in club race rules) goes straight back and out through the rear of
the hood, where a piece of tape keeps it from falling back under the hood
when racing.  Otherwise, it sits under the hood out of mischief's way.

See you at Texas World if the creeks don't rise.  You'll get it done.    I
should be home puttng an engine in and not pounding on a typewriter.

Now, if someone like Mike (Connecticut is a long way from College
Station, I guess) wants to know why the old factory kill switches only
have one set of terminals, and how did factory make this work on its
RSRs and such, I don't know.   Maybe they were willing to let the long
battery cable to the starter (plus its extension backwards over the
engine to the B+ terminal of the alternator) stay live, and only ran the hot
wires to the ignition through the kill switch.  That will save the diodes and
whales, kill the ignition, pumps, lights, and whatnot.  I don't know how the
Scrutineers view that - is the starter-alternator wiring a circuit not
disconnected from the battery, and hence not good enough?  But why
take the physical chance even if they say that's OK.  The 3 switch deal
only sounds complicated.  It isn't, and it is a better mousetrap.

what and when they turned my kill switch at Heartland Park at tech the
engine kept merrily running)
