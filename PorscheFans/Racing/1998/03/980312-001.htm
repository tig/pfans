I had no idea my post would have such a response so i'll offer more info here
en masse.

the swap meet is this saturday, sponsored by northern new jersey region pca at
Autohaus in Morristown, NJ.  Exit Rte. 124 off I-287 follow to center of
Morristown.  Follow the "green" or town square around and follow rt. 24 out of
town.  Autohaus is about 3/4 mi. out of town, behind "High Marques" ( a very
nice used porsche store).

The harnesses were bought from Autopower, i think they
actually were made by Bell and autopower sewed their sticker on them.  I'm not
sure the dates, originally purchased in 1993. 
they are cam lock centers, five point with snap in
hardware, pull down lap belts.  black 
i'll take $100.00 for the 2 sets at the swapmeet.

the roll bar is sold for 400.00

the wheels are ATEV brand. german built one piece five spoke wheels.
They are in dirty, but very excellent condition.Those of you, and there was
more than one, who asked if they are factory wheels, HELLO... 
I don't have the offsets right now, Original price was $2400.00 (don't forget
8 and 9.5 ) if they dont sell at the swap meet for $1200.00 i'll post all that
info.  they are not very light, i think about 27lbs.   let me ask you this,
are you driving your car to such a degree that the weight of the wheels will
make the difference?  I ran 235 and 275 R1's and they were great.  i run 2:16
at watkins glen and 1:02 flat at lime rock with those wheels.  They are fine.

The strut bar is for sale because i'm not sure if they work without also
stiffening underneath.  My suspension guy said not to bother and the car runs
fine.  At swap meet $150.00

H&R springs lower the car about 1.25 inch and are progressive.  They are the
C2T or RS America springs as opposed to the "regular" C2 springs.  I think the
rates run from about 150 to about 250 lbs. they are moderate for street and
nice for track.
At swap meet $250.00.

I also have full original suspension. and full original exhaust in excellent
condition. price tbd.  
See you Sat.
