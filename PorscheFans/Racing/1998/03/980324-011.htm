>>
I heard a lot of talk at the track about updating dampers to Bilsteins,
but I've already got them.  What about 22 mm sway bars front and rear?
My mechanic swears that most aftermarket sway bars don't fit correctly
and suggested updating to Carrera sway bars.  Would that do the trick? <<

22mm bars are pretty big, I don't know why people run them
unless you have a car with very high spring rates.

I have 19mm AJR bars on my "RS" and the end links are lousy and clunk
a lot. They are heim joints with bolts going through them, like
the Automotion "deluxe" adjustable drop links. Not a good
idea as threads going through the rod-end will wear, causing slop. 
I replaced the threaded bolts with bolts with threads on the end only
and they are better but still not great. 

I don't like the rear bar's mounting to the camber eccentic bolt.
I guess the newer cars are like that? I have enough trouble keeping
alignment without the damn swaybar trying to change it...
I have the stock swaybar mounts on my '73 banana arms that would seem 
better. Does anyone know of a link to attach my AJR slider-end bars 
to the banana arm?
