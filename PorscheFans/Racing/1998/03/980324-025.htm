Mike,

It seems to me the best solution on an SC would be to upgrade to factory
Turbo bars (20 f/r, I think) along with the appropriate race/performance
bushings for the swaybar only.

My 78 SC has street Biltien dampers, and frankly I don't think I'd want
the Sports unless the car was virtually a dedicated track car... the
street damping is plenty stiff!  Am preparing to install 22/27 T-Bars,
and also considering the Turbo swaybar upgrade.  This is as much as I'd
go if the car is going to be street driven at all.
