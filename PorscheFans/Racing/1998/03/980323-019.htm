Jon - if I had a 914 I guess I'd wonder why a brace was needed also. 
Of course, if you don't have the seat all the way back (say for a shorter
driver), and you wreck and seat detatches, you have loosened up your
seat and shoulder belts quite a bit, despite there being no back seat to
fall into.

Hard to say what the right, just, and proper balance between required
safety equipment, cost, and having fun is.  Myself, I'd err on the side of
requiring less and letting us (we are, by definition, all adults) figure out
how much extra personal safety we wanted to spring for beyond the
basics which have always been required.  But not everybody sees it
that way.

For instance, seems reasonable to me to require the GT class cars to
have full cages and some other stuff.  These are race car classes.  Most
of the drivers have pretty much retired these cars from street use.  On
the other hand, the newest 993s with some allowed prep and in capable
hands, really go like stink, as fast as some of the GT classes.  The faster
you go the worse the wreck, but how much do you require someone to
do to their new or pretty new car?
