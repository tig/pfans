There was some discussion of them at the Zone 1 Tech Tactics a couple
pf weeks ago. Mainly, what I remember is:

 - they don't have the asymmetric sidewall construction of the R1, i.e.
no built-in negative camber

 - they won't be available until around the end of the summer

 - they won't necesarily feel faster, but they are

 - they will be phased in, and the current R1's will be phased out,
in a somewhat limited range of sizes. Curiously, 225/50-16 was
not on the list of about 20 sizes to be available early on, but
he thought that might just be a transcription error

 - BFG does NOT expect to have a fire sale to get rid of existing
stocks of current R1's.
