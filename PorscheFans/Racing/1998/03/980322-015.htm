Yes, very very true. But after a time of learning how to make your
strewet tires happy and survive the experience (meaning you're not
overdriving the tires, and not locking 'em up etc.) then you will have
the skills to adapt to the very different characteristics of race tires
better and quicker. And all race tires have their own leaning curve.
When I switched from A008Rs to R1s many years ago, I tore 'em up pretty
bad in a fairly short time learning what the tires really wanted.

To those with ulimited budgets, hit "delete" now. To the rest, race
tires are expensive, especially for some of our bigger wheeled
bretheren. And a novice starting out will anihilate a set of race tires
is no time _flat_. Soft sticky race tires don't take to misstreatment
quite as well as less expensive hard street compound tires. 

That's a major reason why I say start on street tires. Learn how to
interpret what the tires want to perform the best. Once you learn how to
treat tires well, race tires will last longer.

Yes, but a novice is not (or _should_ not) be going out there to 'race'
right away. They're going out there to learn how to handle their car in
a high performance setting and learn how the car behaves at or near the
limit. This is knowledge that applies accross the board. Street tires,
DOT race tires, or slicks, the basic prinicples apply. Yes, the tires
all behave markedly differently form each other, but when you've
inexpensively learned how to make the tires happy, they'll last longer
and stick better. And that'll shave seconds off your lap time and
dollars off your tire budget.

Exactly. The novice driver will experience the limit more frequently and
at lower speeds than they would experience on race rubber. They've got
to learn what a spin is like, or they'll never be able to recover one
when it does finally occur at speed. And then when they _do_ switch to
race rubber, they'll be blown away at the difference.

Ah, but you _can_ teach basic principles of line, braking, turn in and
many other important concepts in just about any bucket o' bolts that
runs. Hence my ITC Fiesta suggestion. :)

And novices will utterly destroy a good set of race tires in far less
time than they would destroy street tires ($$$). And let's remember,
we're not talking about 'racing', we're talking about drivers ed and
learning _how_ to race. For actual 'racing' I think street tires are a
bad idea as they can't handle the stresses that racing places on our
car-shoes.

Just my $.02
