>Everybody seems to have a different philosophy. 

	If you follow the Tire Rack's info on R1's they eventually lead
you to the original R1 Engineer.  This guy says he designed the tires so
that lateral grip and pressure are inversely proportional.  I tried his
method several times- the tires kept rolling over so far that fellow
autocrossers said I was about 1/4 of an inch from asphalt to rim.  I may
be totally wrong, but I agree with the original message postor and not
the original tire engineer.  From my experience the R1's work much
better in the 32-35psi (cold) range than in the 25-30 range.  I was
racing a front-engined car at the time, 911 pressures should obviously
be very different.

	As an aside any ideas on a good all around race tire?  I need
something that will be decent for autocross and roadrace, but without
the wear characteristics of warm butter (the R1's are great for a very
short number of heat cycles, then they fall apart).  Maybe I'm crazy,
but some durability would be nice.

Thanks
