This is a very, very important point that Michael brings up. Take the
time to learn the car when _it's_ limits are slightly closer to your
own. And by that I mean, that the limits of the car are lower and therby
a little closer to your (the novice driver) own.

Not unforgiving, but things happen much quicker at 100mph than at 40mph.
That's why when someone asks me about getting into competition oriented
driving that I recomend they start autocrossing first. Now I know a few
well skilled track-only drivers that have very low opinions of autoxing,
I for one think that they don't know @#$%. Autoxing allows you to learn
the limits of the car and how the car will behave at, and beyond, those
limits. And you can do this in a setting where if you loose it, all that
will probably happen is knocking down a few cones. Yes, on a track
things happen much quicker. But the symptoms of 'loosing it' will still
be similar. And with a little experience, you (the driver) will be able
to recognise those limits before you exceed them.

Yup. Last driver's ed I attended (that was a while ago) the only two
cars to hit the armco were an RX-7tt, and a 355 (very sad). The Z-cars,
rabbits, mushtangs and others may have spun, and may have gotten a
little out of shape, but they did so at slower speeds, and had more time
to react and recover.

Well, I wouldn't go quite so far. I'm not going to recomend to a new 993
owner that they go out and buy an ITC fiesta to learn in (although I
think that'd be a _great_ way to do so), I will recomend that they stay
on street tires for a while.
