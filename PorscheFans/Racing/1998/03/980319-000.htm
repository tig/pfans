Thanks for everyone responding to the IMSA-GTO, it really helped.  But I have
new questions.  I wonder if Audi and Porsche ever came into direct competion.
I know Porsche entertained the idea of Gruppe B ralley in the early-mid
eighties, and built several cars to challenge the competion.  The 953, 959
were the ultimate end to that idea, but did Porsche ever see Audi in that
race?  Or in any other ralley race?  What about any race for that matter?
IMSA, SCCA?  Did Porsche ever directly compete against Audi.

Since Audi is but a sibling company of Porsche (at least in my opinion,
Ferdinand Piech was a Porsche), owned 100% by VW.  So, would Audi have ever
challened the boys from Stuttgart, given their business friendship?  Remember,
the greatest Auto Union car of all time (and of pre-war automotive history)
was the P-Wagen, the sixteen cylinder supercar that defined grand prix and
even, to a point, modern F1 and CART.  Would they challenge each other?  The
word is Audi builds a 1 million dollar + enduro racer ala GT1.
