The C4 and twin turbo will have this problem severely
but you should NOT in a C2 if you drive correctly.

That method will not get decent results on ANY car with good power.
You will get too much wheelspin/hop. A 993 has enough torque/power
to spin the wheels even dropping the clutch at 3000 RPMs, if
floored you will spin the rear tires and do donuts.

It will if you don't abuse it.

Best results I found starting a '97 993 
with sticky wide tires was to SLIP the clutch a little and 
SQUEEZE on the throttle at about 3000 RPMs - the car is 
VERY EASY to launch and control with
the throttle that way- just keep the wheels at the limit of adhesion
with a bit of wheelspin and there are only a handful of cars
ever made that will keep up with you in a drag start.
  
My 72 S on the other hand requires MUCH higher RPMs
and more slipping of the clutch to avoid bogging. It will
keep up with a 993 until about 60 MPH due to gearing
and light weight, then the 993 HP takes over and I'm toast.

It will be interesting to see how much (if any) faster my "RS"
lightweight is than a stock 993 in the 1/4 mile.
But at high speeds the 964/993's HP will be unbeatable,
it will be tough to keep up with them on the race track in D class.
