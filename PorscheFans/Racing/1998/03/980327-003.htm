Hi Michael,

Your posting struck a particular nerve.  After serious thought, I've decided
to respond.  I've participated in 6 track days with Metro New York. ( 4 days
at the Bridge and 2 at Pocono).  They are without a doubt, the funnest,
friendliest, and easiest group to work with.  I've made it a point to show up
a 6:30 a.m. at the track to give them a hand with Tech.  I know that they are
a small region, and like most small regions, it is only a handful of
individuals who do the majority of the work.  The comments I'm about to make
are not indicative of MNY, just of a particpant who saw things differently
that weekend.

okay, here's my rambling, feel free to flame ( I just bought a new driver's
suit )...

1.	I attended that same event with MNY as well as being in the same run group
as yourself.  	I drive a '90 911C2 and had the number 157.

2.	I certainly never remember lapping the field three times(at least not in
one session). I definitely remember that you never passed me. In fact, I'd say
	we were very similiar, both in machine and skill ( both of our cars would run
in F class in 	PCA Club racing and I have 37 days at the track)

3.	I caught up with you at the end of the first day.  Perhaps you forgot about
the white 911 	you could not shake off but also would not give a passing
signal.

4.	Try to remember the conditions of the track that weekend.  Rainy all day
Saturday and 	extrememly cold and overcast all day Sunday.  Nobody was going
particular fast either 	day.  I know I was only driving 8/10ths at best.  I
ran my rain tires on Saturday, but wet is 	wet, and grip is not part of the
picture.  On Sunday, I ran my R1's, but when the 	temperature is almost
freezing, they could never really heat up.

5.	Put yourself in MNY's shoes.  Here they have a driver who has only been
participating in 	track events for ONE year.  You were not a club racer and
you were not an instructor.
	They did not know you as a driver.  This in combination with the lousy track
condition is a 	tough call to make when placing 'new' people in higher groups.

6.	If I recall, it wasn't just one representative from MNY that voted against
moving you up a 	group, it was several members of the Driver's Ed committee.
Keep in mind, this is only 	my impression.

7.	You displayed a great deal of arrogance.  Trust me, I was there.  They were
not happy 	with your attitutude when you found out that you would not be moved
up. This may have 	contributed to MNY not wanting to work with you.  No
organizer wants a 'hot dog' 	ruining an event by causing an incident to
himself that involves tons of paperwork both for 	PCA and the track.

8.	If you were really driving as great as you stated, I'm sure the corner
workers would have 	radioed or mentioned to Chief Instructor of your dilemma.

9.	Leave timed events to either Time Trials or Club Racing.  I do alot of
Driver's Ed events 	because my insurance covers my car.  Unfortuately, my
insurance doesn't cover any timed 	event to include autocrossing, time trials
or club racing.  If you want to time your laps, 	buy a Hot Lap Timer.  Most
serious drivers have (and not so serious) and you can spend 	all day comparing
lap times.

While some of my comments seemed strong, they are in no way are representative
of the feelings or atitutudes of MNY.  I am a member of Chesapeake Region.  I
simply have a great time with MNY.  Hey, remember, this is supposed to be fun
and stress reducing.  Last I checked, there wasn't any scouts for Chamption,
Brumos, Rohr or Kelly Moss at the Pocono event, or for that matter, at any PCA
events I've been to.   If you want to avoid being placed in a slow group, try
Club Racing.  There, if you're placed in a slow group, you'll probably win a
trophy!  Besides, being placed in a slow group makes for great video to show
to family and friends.  Imagine, lapping a field in twenty minutes....they'll
think your Jeff Gordon's apprentice.
