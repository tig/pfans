Chris, 
I'm pretty sure it was Hurley Haywood who drove the an Audi in GTO that
year, he dominated the class in a car with a production based chassis and
giving up 50hp to the rest of the field. I remember watching the end of the
GTO race from one of the Renaissance Center towers during the 89(?) Detroit
F1 weekend. The thing that stuck out was the peculiar (but very effective)
lines that the Quattros took. A weight penalty was subsequently applied to
AWD (Quattro) equipped cars in the class and Audi dropped out. I don't
think Porsche had a big, if any, presence in that class though.

Subject: Porsche vs. Audi

I am having a big arguement with a friend of mine who is a Quattro lister
who
says Audi beat Porsche in 1989 IMSA GTO.  But I have no stats and no idea
what
he's saying.  Did Porsche ever race them?  At any other time?  What were
the
results?  Any information is good.
