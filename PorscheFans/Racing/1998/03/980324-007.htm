To add to the racing room discussion, a fellow on the Wheel2Wheel list 
typed in this interesting piece.  I'm in complete agreement, and would 
love to see something like included in either the PCA Club Racing rule 
book, web page, or just included in race packets at each event.

I don't know where this was originally published, but it has been a 
handout
at Waterford Hills for a couple of years now.  The author is Mike Carney.


GCR 9.1.1:  "The responsibility rests with the overtaking driver.  The
overtaken driver has the responsibility to be aware...and not to
impede...The overtaken driver shall not block.  Any driver who fails to
make use of the rear view mirror, or who appears to be blocking..., may be
black flagged and/or penalized."

That's it.  All of it.  The entirety of the "Rules of the Road" regarding
cars dealing with the presence of each other.  Succinct, isn't it?  If not
downright cryptic.

Actually it's rather verbose compared to the usual bench racing
pronouncement, "Whoever has his nose in front has the corner."  One 
wonders
why we would be so interested in something so simplistic.

Such statements usually come at the end of a discussion of some racing
incident, which in turn was likely caused when one or both drivers ignored
the real rule of the road.  Know where the other one is if at all possible
and, whether it is or not, leave room for him or her to survive the 
moment.

Having your nose in front does not mean you own the corner.  That other 
car
is still present, is still racing, and has the right to enough space to
exist.  Just a car width plus a few inches, that's all.

And if you are in the other seat and that guy does not have his nose in
front, it does not mean he/she doesn't own the corner either.  If you 
drive
all the way to the apex and that car was far enough up or coming on so 
fast
that contact can reasonably be expected to happen, you just violated the
rule.  He/she could even be fully behind you but be obviously committed to
the inside at such a speed that you can no longer move into that path
without being hit.  You must be aware of the relative speed and car
placements, then decide what you can or cannot do.  It all comes down to
judgement.

That is the core of racing, the very essence of it.  If you demand of need
the entire road to race, go Solo I instead.  Wheel to wheel racing centers
on dealing effectively with the presence of each other and still racing. 
You should be able to get or stay in front by superior skills and/or
equipment, not by your willingness to commit mayhem.  Being a race driver
entails leaving that car width plus inches, then instantaneously picking
and driving a racing line using the part of the road left to you.

It is ever changing and requires intense constant concentration while
operating at the car's limits within those situations.  It has no hard, 
set
rules like "nose in front".  That's as untenable as the "rules" of
emergencies.  (What do you do when a car spins in front of you?  How 
should
I know?  I've only had a few hundred of them.  Simplistic souls say steer
for is, hit the gas, scream 'Oh s...'.  What happens is, you take in
endless bits of information, process it, make a decision, act, reevaluate,
act again, and so on -- all faster than onlookers can gasp and jump to
their feet.  That's what makes race drivers.  We do not react.  We think,
at speeds that seem to be reactions. We revel in that ability.  And the
volume of our thought processes in those moments explain why a brief
incident can require so much description).

If you cannot do this, you are no race driver.  That's why being one is
such a big deal.  Who would care if anyone could do it?

And if you insist on disregarding the other guy, moving over knowing
contact is likely, you are also not a race driver.  You are a jerk.  A 
fast
jerk, possibly, but a jerk nonetheless.  Any other story is b.s.

You are also somewhat shortsighted.  Contact between cars tends to 
unsettle
them, to make the moment ragged and uneven, and that has never been the
description of how to go fast.  It also causes damage to your race car,
damage that may end your race and that you yourself have to pay for.  Why
would one choose to cost himself unnecessary expense for the privilege of
going slower escapes me.

Racing will give you plenty of opportunity for that without your
assistance.  Untimely mechanical foul-ups, human error (yours or theirs),
and occasional bad luck will at times mangle you charger.  You don't need
to encourage that with an attitude that racing is sheer nerve and guts. 
It's not.  It's concentration, attention, and skill -- skill that delights
in showing the other guy that it can drive around him and still do it
faster.  That is where our attitude shows.
