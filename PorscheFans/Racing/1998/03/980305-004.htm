Hello Mike,

In short, two companies, OG Racing, and Racer Wholesale.

> 1. I have OMP seats, need to raise them and move forward.

OG has a Sparco 'generic' looking side mount in steel,
price is $30. It has a number of holes, so can adjust the
seat height and angle. They have other Al mounts for $100 or so.

> 3. Any hints on best metal valve stems, cutoff switch,
> and window net appreciated. Any good ideas for mounting

You can get the generic window net and mounting kit from
Racer Wholesale for less than $50. The net is $12.95, and
the mounting kit is $24.99. The mounting kit is two steel
bars, one solid, the other spring loaded. It comes with 
brackets that get screwed or welded to the roll bar or cage.
Very easy to install, works well too. OG sells a similar kit
from M + R (the Racer Wholesale kit is Autopro) for 20 and
$35 or so.

For the kill switch, that's like $40 from Racer Wholesale,
or $48 from OG.

I've dealt with both companies, and they are both great. Racer
Wholesale has slightly better prices, but OG carries a lot
of Porsche specific stuff.
