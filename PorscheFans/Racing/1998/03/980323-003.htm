I think there's an important point here for novices considering entering
a
track event.  My interest stems from organizing and instructing at
driving
schools, and from teaching a car control clinic for new drivers. 
There's no
doubt that a well setup car on sticky tires is easier to drive fast than
a
sloppy car on hard street rubber.  It also seems clear that there's no
sense
in having novice drivers wrestle with evil handling, poorly setup cars. 
But
that's not really the issue, as I see it.  

The issue is that more and more novices are showing up at track events
with
cars whose limits far exceed their skills.>>>

Hi Kevin,

I think this thread has a few more emails left before it gets stale.

Remember that I recommended R tires for an autocrosser who appeared to
be interested in continuing in the sport, not for a newbie DE driver. 

But I really have to take exception to your comment that R tires
contribute to newbies getting in over their heads at DE events. I think
_any_ Porsche at a DE event in the hands of someone who has never
autocrossed or taken a car control clinic is an accident waiting to
happen. The instructors who get into 930s with newbies have to be
congratulated for their bravery (or stupitidy). But a friend of mine
will never do another DE because of the incident that happened to him
while instructing in a 356.

To me the answer to lessening the number of stupid incidents is simple
(and one that you hinted at in your message): Require everybody to
become proficient at autocrossing before you let them onto the track. By
proficient I mean being able to get within 4 seconds or so of an
accomplished autocrosser using similar equipment on street tires or
within 2 seconds using R tires. I can't stress how much it means to
learn car control in an open lot at slower speeds with nothing but cones
to hit _before_ you get to the track.

I have been autocrossing for 11 years and running DE for 2 years. All my
DEs have been on R tires and I have NEVER gone off the track. Having the
sense to switch from 11/10ths while autocrossing to 9/10ths at the track
is part of the reason, but the other is that I knew how to recover from
a spin before I needed to use that skill to save my car and my life. 

I would have been royally pissed if someone had told met that I couldn't
do DE on R tires when I was a newbie because R tires are much more
predictable and hence safer at the limits of adhesion.

Regards,

Paul Foster
