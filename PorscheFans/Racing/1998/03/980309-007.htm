I have a 928s 84 and I have been beating on it pretty hard on the Track
in school events.  (it  been through 7 schools and on open track were I w=
as
giving the Pro 7s a run for their money all day)
The car has 145 original miles on the motor and 10-15K on the clutch and
transmission.  20k on the timing belt.
Does anyone have any opinions on what types of things I can do to prevent=

the engine from =

having problems.   Rings are probably weak ( but doesnt burn any oi),  as=
 I
have only 150psi on each cylinder and it should be 175.  (comp ration is
now about 8.2:1)   This might be good as now it doesnt pay to red line, I=

can shift at 5500 in all the gears and redlining it doesnt buy me anythin=
g.
(exept in 2nd gear)
Had it dyno'ed and it is very strong, 263 ftlbs ( 300 flywheel thanks to
the headers and no cat,  race exhaustl) to the wheels at 4k but only 157 =
at
6200  =

   I have been running Prolong .  Does anyone have any opinions on this
additive??
I figure it is good insurance, but would like the opion of this group
anyway.  (pros and cons)
I change the oil after every event now, probably not nessary, but Im
worried about the old guy.
Let me know if anyone else has had as much good, strong service  (so far =
as
I have)  with the 928s motor.
