Guys,

I was tempted to just let this thread run out but, as it affects the way =
I do=0Athings, I thought it best to address a couple of issues that seem =
to be=0Arunning through recent postings.

In the past, sometime in September, racers were informed of possible rule=
s=0Achanges and then, in November or December, told what rules were chang=
ed.=0AWhile this process will continue, I think that lead time should be =
lengthened=0Aas much as possible to give everyone a chance to know what w=
ill be expected of=0Athem next year.  The notice in the Club Racing News =
was simply a =93heads up=94 as=0Ato what the Committee is doing and to co=
mmunicate to the racers what was=0Ahappening.  I plan on continuing to le=
t everyone know what is going on as much=0Aas possible.

The criticism (interestingly enough, much of it from non-racers) seems to=
 be=0Athat something was mandated, that specifics weren=92t given and tha=
t there was=0Ano justification.  Racers, read the article again and give =
me a break.

The requirement for the stated safety equipment (and there will probably =
be=0Amore) doesn=92t go into effect until January, 1999.  And, true, thes=
e items were=0Anot on the safety questionnaire;  but that survey was not =
a ballot, it was a=0Away to get information from you.  Safety issues will=
 not be decided by popular=0Avote but your feelings are of paramount inte=
rest to me and will be used to=0Aguide us to be as safe as possible in a =
very dangerous sport while being as=0Aunobtrusive as feasible.

The Committee is studying specifics on the requirements and everyone will=
 be=0Ainformed as that process continues.  Still, it is interesting that =
SCCA=0Arequires seat bracing (and has for some time) in at least three pl=
aces in the=0AGCRs and does not specify how.  Their reasoning seems to be=
 that it is more=0Aimportant that it be done than how it is accomplished.=
  As long as it produces=0Aa safer car, I agree with Dodge that too many =
rules/details and it stops being=0Afun.

As to justification, read Chris Brown=92s posts.  But, even that should n=
ot be=0Anecessary and I didn=92t think (don=92t think) it is necessary to=
 justify the=0Adecisions of the Safety Committee.  We have one goal and t=
hat is to make PCA=0AClub Racing as safe as humanly possible.  Because so=
me of the guiding=0Aprinciples in my life are self reliance and personal =
responsibility, if it=0Awere up to me the only rules we would make would =
be directed at making it=0Asafer for the other guy when you do something =
stupid.  Tragically, we don=92t=0Alive in that kind of a world and are fo=
rced to mandate rules to keep you from=0Atrying to kill yourself (bad for=
 the gene pool, but necessary in any event).=0AIn sum, the decisions of t=
he Safety Committee are made because we believe that=0Athe changes will r=
esult in safer racing for our members.

If you have a license you receive the Newsletter and have my email addres=
s, my=0Asnail mail address, my fax number and my phone numbers.  If you h=
ave comments=0Aon the Program, I=92m interested.  If you don=92t have a l=
icense, come join us.=0AThis is the most incredible, fun filled organizat=
ion possible and it=92s filled=0Awith some really great people.

Monte=0A
