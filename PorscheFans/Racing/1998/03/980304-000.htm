Last Thursday, there was another Town of Southhampton board meeting 
concerning the planned golf course. Acording to a friend of mine 
who was at the meeting, the following occured:

Track owner Robert Rubin had an expert testify that this golf course
will not pollute the surrounding area. This testimony took about 20 minutes.

The Coalition for the South Fork (or some other local group) then had
their expert testift that the golf course would pollute the surrounding area.

Some local people then spoke about the golf course. The vast majority
of people prefer the track to the golf course.

The town board then read a prepared statement that said something to
the effect of: Since we have heard conflicting testimony, the board
will obtain their own expert to render a decision on the pollution
aspect. 

There will be another meeting in April (I believe).

Net result - no news either way. There will not be a golf course built
in the immediate future. However, that doesn't mean the track will
be open (although we're hopeful).
