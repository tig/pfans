 putting any technical information on the Web, and he may well be on a
 short leash.  Last fall/winter we learned it was official policy NOT to put
 the Club Race Rules on the Web.  I have never heard an intelligible
 rationale for that decision.  Just some bafflegab.

Yeah, that's like this upcoming rule (Jan 1, 1999) on dedicated raceseats with
slots for belts and backbrace attachments.  No rationale as to WHY at all in
latest Club Race news.  What problem are we trying to solve, especially in
stock class cars?  I though the rule on making sure the belts fit right was
good enough.  Just another $400-650 to spend!  And the backbrace rule doesn't
even have any requirements attached to it.  What does it have to be?  What
does it have to attach to?  And I don't even remember dedicated raceseats
being talked about in the safety questionaire we got.  Oh, well.
