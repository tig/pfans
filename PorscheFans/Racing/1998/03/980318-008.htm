Fellow Racers:

There was a recent email on the wheeltowheel mailing list regarding 
"racing room". This is a topic that I would like to discussed in the 
Porsche Racing community as well, so I thought I would forward my 
comments here as well.

Donn,

Great topic.  I've been involved with Porsche Club Racing since the 
program started back in '93.  As a rookie at the first-ever event, I was 
worried about how all those cars were going to avoid hitting each other 
when the racing got tight.    My break-through came during a 
ground-school session that focused on racing room.  Here's what I learned 
at that time:

Since you are the driver making the pass it is up to you to complete the 
pass safely.  Removing all the available track while the other driver is 
almost beside you is not safe.  Because you didn't complete your pass on 
the straight, you need to leave the other driver some room.  Think of it 
this way -- a driver being overtaken should never have to avoid the 
overtaking car, by driving significantly different line.  They may have 
to slow down if the other car is in front (and going slower), but 
counting on avoidance by the overtaking car is risking a collision. 

I try to "leave 'em room, we'll race to the next corner".

You should try to maintain your position, but be prepared to allow the 
other car to exercise his right to "control" the line.  This might mean 
that you have to drive into the inside of the turn.  More important than 
what you do is what the other driver does.  I think the right thing is to 
allow some racing room (say 1/2 - 3/4 of a lane would be about right, 
assuming there is no huge hole/wall at the apex of the turn).

My only "at fault" incident occured last year in a situation just like 
this during practice.  I was approaching a much slower car (stock 914), 
with my GT-2 (PCA GT3R) 914-6 as we approached Laguna Seca Turn 6, 
(closing speed probably 25+ mph), he was getting big passing signals from 
the corner worker and another GT-2 car had just passed him.  I had the 
bumper even with his door when we both began to turn in.  We could have 
completed the turn side-by-side or I was prepared to put two wheels in 
the dirt to go by.   When it became obvious the other driver was 
intending to use all the track,  backed out as hard as possible, but the 
last two-inches of his bumper tapped the first 4 inches of my front 
fender/bumper.  It was my fault for not completing a pass safely, but at 
the same time, with sufficient racing room (say 3-feet of pavement) this 
incident would have never happened.

Afterwards, the other driver said "I knew you were there, but I wasn't 
going to give up the corner".  This occured during an SCCA "vintage" 
event, and it's certainly made me a little more cautious about making 
sure I can complete a pass safely.

Basically what I learned in that first ground school was that if another 
car pulls alongside you (say bumper even with the rear wheel), the car in 
front still controls the line, but can easily leave enough room for a 
pass to be completed safely (not necessarily easily, but safely).  Just 
because someone is alongside doesn't mean you have to give up, but race 
them and be aware of their position.  Some of the best racing experiences 
I've had involved side-by-side racing where a pass was never completed! 

The car on the inside of the turn will need to go slower (because they 
won't have the entire exit width to work with), and the car on the 
outside can usualy go a little faster (provided they don't go so wide 
that they loose traction in the marbles).
