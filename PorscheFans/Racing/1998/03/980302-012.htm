Some posted a note with the following text:

>We race 3 cars with them.  All have had line failures. Fortunately 
never at speed.
* One failure was as we left tech inspection @ a Sebring Club race.

I dunno, maybe I have my head up my ass, but I just don't get it! 
 There is *no* performance improvement to be had with these stupid s/s 
hoses.  Why the hell do people on this list (who I assume to have some 
modicum of intelligence) keep trying to rationalize using the fool 
things?  The race car's I've been involved with (full out, mega-bucks 
GT cars) use factory rubber hoses.  The brakes work great, and we have 
*never* had a rubber line fail.

If you absolutely have to piss away $60, buy your car some Nomex fuzzy 
dice.  At least they won't get you killed.
