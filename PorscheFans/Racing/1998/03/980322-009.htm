I want to add a correction to the comment on the weight of the new BFG
tire.  It is HEAVIER than the R1.  I asked the rep at techtactics and he
told us that the new tire is heavier even with the less amount of rubber on
it. The extra weight had to do with the new construction.  This new tire
sounds very much like the Hoosier tire, i.e., stiff sidewalls that do not
compensate for camber changes like the old R1.  I have switched to Hoosiers
last year and found them to be faster for autocross, but tricky at high
speed tracks.  They stick real good and without much warning, they just let
go.  And yes, they do not last as long as the old R1.  Another advantage is
that the Hoosier is significantly lighter than the R1 (I switched from 205
to 225 and the Hoosiers were lighter by a few pounds).

On another front, I would like to find aftermarket 15x8 or 15x9 rims for a
914 four bolt pattern.  Used ones preferably.  Does anyone run these rims?
Who makes them and how much? I have 15x7 rims to trade.

I am also looking for used 1/4' 914 four bolt spacers.  I can't believe
that Automotion sell a pair for about $50!  I have checked Parts America
but could not find a size that will fit the 914.
