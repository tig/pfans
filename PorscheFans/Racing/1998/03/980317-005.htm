I find someone who is dead consistent and of a high calibre, preferably a
national champion in Solo II or road racing or whatever.  I keep records to
see how far I am from them from event to event.  Once I'm close to their
times and am not improving anymore, no matter what I try, then I look at
tires, etc.

I'll give you an example.  In the NW SCCA region, we have some excellent
drivers, the Fordahl's, the Babb's, Bill Buetow, Glen Hernandez and many
more.  Since Bill Buetow (944S2) has the closest car to mine (944TS), I 
use him as my target.  He is dead consistent and is always very fast.
When I got my 944T, I was a full 10 seconds behind him!  Within a few
events, I'd closed the gap to 6-8 seconds behind him, with no consistency.
By bugging Bill and Glen to death, I've managed to close the gap down to
3 seconds now for two events in a row, one a high speed, one a low speed.
People like Bill and Glen will gladly jump into your car and tell you if
you can go any further with what you have.  It's taken Paul and I 1.5 years
to shorten the gap on Bill!

At this point, I think a set of "R" tires will give me 1.5-2 seconds over
my S-02 tires which would place me somewhere around 1-1.5 seconds behind
Bill which is about right for a Turbo vs. NA motor.  The challenge then
is to beat Bill :)

The way I look at racing and almost everything in life is that it takes
three years to be successful at anything.  Your first year is spent
feeling your way around, your second is developing the skills necessary
to win, this is the year you make stupid mistakes.  The third year is
when you have to win.  I'm currently in my third year and everything
is just sort of working out right now.

Paul and I also like a challenge.  No one feels the 944T is competitive
in auto-x environments and to a large extent, it's true, but what fun
when you beat a car that should do well in an auto-x with a car that
shouldn't.

So, don't bother with "R" tires until you are consistently 3-4 seconds
behind the fastest guy in your class or your target person.  No matter
what any shop tells you, "R" tires are not worth >3 seconds on an autocross
course.  If you slap on a set of "R" tires and you go 10 seconds faster,
that just shows you that there is still tons of time left out there.

I used to be an equipment chaser, buying anything that would make me
faster.  I had some FTDs in my local region with my AWD Talon.  I felt
like I was on top of the world, until my team mate (Paul) drove my
Talon when his was in the shop and he beat me by 0.9 seconds!  Even though
I was in 2nd in that regional and beat the 3rd place guy by over 1.6 seconds,
I realized then that I sucked.  I sold that car shortly and bought a stock
944T.  I only have factory race chips in the car and that's mainly only
beneficial on the street and high speed track events.  The car has a close
to factory alignment, 17" wheels (cosmetic more than anything) and a set
of S-02 tires.  For those wondering, I've closed the gap on Paul too,
we usually finish events within a few thousandths of a second of each
other now.

If at all possible, get a good friend as a team mate that is FAST.  I've
noticed that Paul and I have leapfrogged the guys that joined at the same
time as we did because we push each other like crazy.  We both hate to
lose and we both want to beat everyone else so we keep pushing like
mad and now we finish races extremely close.  I've noticed this trend
in other pfans (Barry Lenoble and John Pohl I think do this too).

Have fun out there and if you get a chance, take a race kart for a ride,
you won't soon forget the experience.

Hope this helps,
Farzaan - track junkie, autocrosser and now an official kart racer!
