This string about starting out on race tires vs street tires is a lot of
fun.  Everyone has an opinion....

I have not done any high speed wheel to wheel roadracing, so my
experience may be irrelevant.  I have just purchased my first Porsche
and am looking forward to my first experience with unexpected oversteer
(on the racetrack of course).
	My experience is limited to AX.  In theory the "run what you
brung" street tire argument makes some philosophical sense.  We all had
to walk before we could run.  No one should get too far over his/her
head too quickly.  However, in reality, the handling aspects of street
tires and race tires are very different.  I tried AX on street tires for
a while.  When I decided to get more competitive, I found that I had to,
in some ways, "re-learn" the handling dynamics of the car with race
tires (BFG R1's; highly recommended for AX).  The limits are higher, the
slide characteristics are different, etc.  Personally, I don't think
"racing" on street tires helps you learn how to race.  You learn how to
race by building your skills in a methodical, calculated, and
experienced-based manner.  Also, the street tire guys have forgotten
that some street tires can be down right scary at the edge of the
envelope (grab then loose, grab then loose, looooosssseee.......)  As a
matter of fact, I would say that street tires in general are less
predictable and less confidence-inspiring at the limit.  You don't teach
someone how to race a 930 turbo by starting him out behind the wheel of
a '52 bug with bias-ply tires.  You start SLOWLY in the 930 and build
your skills with experience.

	Last but not least, racing will utterly destroy a good set of
street tires.

Good luck,
