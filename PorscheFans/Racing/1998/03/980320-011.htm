Haven't a clue about that, but Automashin' has a great chart of 901
gears with rpm vs. mph given a set final drive. (7:30 I think)

The easiest way (from what I understand), and you may already have
missed it, is to measure the paper gaskets with a micrometer that you
pull off when you separate the intermediate plate. These gaskets are
used to set the backlash at the factory. Unless you're replacing the
diff with something else, then that's a good way to do it. Measure with
the micrometer and replace with new gaskets of the same thickness. 

This is of course, all IMHO, and I've been known to be wrong before...

Remember the machinists motto:

"Measure with a micrometer, mark with chalk, and cut with an axe." :)
