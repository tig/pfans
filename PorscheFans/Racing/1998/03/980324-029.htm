Hi,

Last Saturday my son and I participated in our first PCA Drivers Ed event
in my street 944 S2 and his street '89 944 Turbo S (see long dissertation
on 924-944 list if interested).  While we both had a lot of fun, it now
appears (from additional comments on my note) that the instruction we
received was less than optimum... and the rules a bit too lax for real
safety.  For instance, I was allowed to drive on the track at speed by
myself after only two sessions with an instructor - approximately 16 =
total
laps, only half of which was with the instructor in the car - the rest
were in "follow along mode" because of the 2 student per instructor =
ratio.

What I'd like to know is:

1)  What constitutes a good DE event in your PCA region?
2)  Should all regions adopt uniform rules or should they be based on the
difficulty of the track in question and the success rate attributed to =
the
program?
3)  How are the DE events normally organized?  Novices only that day, or
intermixed with faster run groups to spread out the cost?
4)  What are some of the special rules that (should) pertain to novice
drivers and how long should they apply?
5)  What typical criteria is used for advancement to "faster" run groups.
6)  Anything else you feel is important.

Thanks,
