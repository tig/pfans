IMO, Pano ads overstate most prices by some...25%(?).  This is from a
Southern California perspective, where parts are plentiful; or maybe I'm
just jaded by swap meet prices.

OTOH, some value must be attributed to an engines heritage and care,
which, in the case of a 3.2, may add as much as $1,000 or more to a
realistic trading price.
