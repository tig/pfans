I recently completed my first track day with my '81 SC.  It was very
exciting, and I want to update my suspension to better deal with track
conditions.  Although the car is not a daily driver, the car will see
street driving.

The car is lowered/balanced/cambered on 21mm torsion bars front, 27 mm
torsion bars rear, Bilstein 'Sport' dampers, and stock sway bars.  3.2
ltr power is put down through Quaife ltd slip 915 on 7" front, 8" rear
fuchs.  I plan to further reduce weight where I can by removal of A/C
and any other "unnecessaries."

I heard a lot of talk at the track about updating dampers to Bilsteins,
but I've already got them.  What about 22 mm sway bars front and rear?
My mechanic swears that most aftermarket sway bars don't fit correctly
and suggested updating to Carrera sway bars.  Would that do the trick?
How about a shock tower brace?

Lastly, any advice on aftermarket mufflers would be appreciated.  Any
noticable improvement?  Do I need dual exit?  I currently run SSI's into
OEM style muffler.
