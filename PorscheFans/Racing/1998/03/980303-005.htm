Tire rack's heat cycling DOES work, it was proven by testing several
sets of tires untreated, normally heat cycled, and with their 
magic process.

You can NOT heat cycle tires by putting them in a sauna, etc
it is a mechanical process of stress to the rubber that cures them.
And it stinks up the sauna.

The best way IMHO is to drive them in circles (I use the turnaround
in an industrial park) until they are warm but not TOO hot.
Run in both directions, then drive around for a while and park
the car for a day. Then the tires should be as good as you can
get them with no added expense except a bit of dizzyness.
