Hi Jon,
Just had to take a tangent on a statement you made:

I have been performing the T&S function for the local club for a while now and I
have to empathize with the T&S people at Sebring (or anywhere for that matter).  I
do not know the people but from my experience, it is very difficult for a group of
amateurs to time and score one race a year and be expected to become proficient at
it.  I have asked Monte Smith to take into consideration having a national T&S
team (or maybe more than one) to standardize Club Race timing.  This could be done
much the same way as the national tech people are handled.  I am not a club racer
(yet) but it really upsets me when I bust my buns to get the job done and then I
get yelled at because the results were not immediate and perfect.  Lets get an
experienced group together and cover all the races.

Nomex undies at the ready.
another Jon (looking forward to "seeing" my first ever club race - one of these
days ;)
