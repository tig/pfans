I agree. This stuff (to me anyway, is interesting).

Big difference between AX and DE. In AX, the only thing you can hurt
is your pride (well, you can damage your car, but you know what I'm
describing) while at DE, you can destroy your car, and perhaps your life.

Good point, but a little too strong, IMHO. As an instructor, I've instructed
numerous 'first timers' and I've only been scared (really scared) a few
times. The vast majority of students, even those driving real fast cars,
are responsible, well meaning people, who really want to learn. They don't 
want to destroy the car or hurt you any more than you want that.

It all depends on the particular driver.

Again, I think this is harsh. IMHO, There is a big difference in driving 
technique between AX and DE. In AX, the goal is time, pure and simple. 
You throw the car around, spin it occassionaly, go off course, and do
anything you can to shave off the last tenths of a second. In DE, the goal
is car control. You should be trying for the last few tenths of lap times,
and you must be smooth to go fast. 

If someone has no interest in autocrossing, why should that stop them
from participating in DE? I agree on the learning skills part, that's
why in Metro, all novices get sent an information packet, and are
required to attend a classroom session before being allowed out on the
track. That gives the student at least an idea of what's going on.

Paul, you're not the typical 'newbie' DE participant. We're used to dealing
with people who don't know an apex from a bpex, and who think 'turn in'
is something you do at the drive in window. 

IMHO, the novices aren't the ones who are dangerous. I have not seen too
many novices get into trouble. For the most part, they stay so far below
the ability of the car that no matter how bad they screw up, the car
saves them. It's the intermediate drivers who damage the most cars. Those
are the people with 3-5 events under their belts. They know enough to
drive consistant lines, and go fast enough to stree the tires, brakes
and suspension. However, they do not have the experience to realize when
they have gotten right up to the limit. Occasionally, they tumble right
over the limit, and we've both seen the results. 

In short, as an instructor, I do not want to see R tires on a first time
student. I want to see a clean, well maintained car, on good quality
street tires. I want a student who listens, tries to go fast, and who
realized that they are NOT the second coming of Senna. If, after a few
events, the student realizes that DE is the thing for them, and gets some
sticky tires, that's OK. I can work with that person.
