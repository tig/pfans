Regarding the trophies, I do think it encourages people to 'race'. In a
DE environment I don't think this is a good thing. A lot of regions only
offer a time trialing program and some even try to persuade people into
believing "it really is just as safe as a DE". I think this sort of
fabrication may have grave implications on DE down the road. As I stated
in another email, I don't find anything inherently wrong with Time
Trialing given that you have made the necessary committment to added
safety equipment and you understand you may lose your car. In my book
it's almost as dangerous as PCA club racing.

After sending the DE stuff to the Racing List I wondered if it was the
appropriate forum. But I decided it was best to discuss it amongst
people from all the various subgroups who have attended DEs and may have
something to offer.

Regarding club racing and the "silly trophies" that can be gained, I
hope to see you on the podium  - right behind me. ;-)

Unfortunately UNIX was an early 'language' for me. You can't get far
without knowing how to 'cat' files...
