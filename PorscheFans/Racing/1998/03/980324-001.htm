DON'T REGISTER FOR GINGERMAN YET!!

Unless you are absolutely certain that you can make it, your car will not
be broken, and nothing could possibly come up with your family that would
keep you from attending.

Just received my entry form today and reminded me of what happened last year:

Several of us from MN registered nice and early for this event.  (As region
registrar, I KNOW that this is generally appreciated).   About 3 weeks
prior to the event, 3 of us tried to cancel (1 wrecked car, 1 unexpected
repair used race budget(ME), 1 family conflict).  In each case, when we
called, the answer was "we don't know if we will be sending refunds.  We
are a small region and  may need to keep your money so we don't lose money
on our race".  After  the race "they" determined that a 50% refund would be
given.  It took several months and several phone calls, but I finally did
receive my 50%.  (of the race entry AND the additional charge for the DE
day).  

Not sure how other regions deal with this, but it's not how we treat other
PCA members who hope to travel to our race at Brainerd.  Why should one
region benefit from a racers misfortune?

At least this year the entry form tells of a 50% cancellation fee after 6/6
and NO refund after 6/20...  Pretty funny considering the registration
deadline is 6/26.  Why would anyone register prior to the 26th??

If I were able to attend this year (family conflict this time).  I would
send the registration and either post-date the check, or bring the check
with me to the race.  Heck, if they are such a small region, hurting for
race entrants... I'll bet you could call 3 days prior and they would
happily take your $'s!

Local members who did attend last year reported that it was a fun and safe
track.  Hotel rooms are a bit hard to get locally and expensive.

Comments?
