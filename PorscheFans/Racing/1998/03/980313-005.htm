Tory - 

$5,500 sounds reasonable for a low mileage 3.2, although the best way
to figure out what is reasonable is to read the Pano ads for a couple of
months to see what people are asking for them.  Maybe some list
member who has been shopping for one will venture an opinion.  I
thought that amount was reasonable in 1989 when I paid it for a used
SC, but who knows, maybe that was way above market.  I'm not much
of a horse trader. 

By the way, while the 3.2s are marvelous street engines, they may not
be the best base for a race engine because of the rods.  The bolts were
reduced in diameter one millimeter so the journals could be larger.  This is
fine for the street, and probably for stock class competition, but when
you make a race engine you can have problems even if you go to
Racewear bolts to get the strength back there.  A friend pumped his up
to 3.3 or 3.4, and had a rod break in the middle all by itself, which I would
have thought not possible, but it did.  I've bent 2.7 rods into pretzels by
eating valves or having a piston break in half at the wrist pin, without the
rod actually breaking anywhere.  Maybe he just had bad luck and there
was a forging flaw in that rod.

The 2.7s have gotten a bad rap, and they can have problems, but many
of these can be fixed and I got a lot of fun out of mine before it
swollowed a valve (never did figure out just why, fairly recent valve etc
job, just one of those things) and I decided to go to a 3.0.  You aren't
going to get Turbo power out of one, though, and if you are dreaming of
that kind of power or even what a 3.8 will put out, you should sell your
2.7 engine.

If you do put some monster motor in your car, you need to put on brakes
appropriate to the power.  You might even be better off selling your car
and buying a turbo to start with, especially if money for this isn't an issue
to you.  Most of us start with what we can afford, and upgrade along
the way (sometimes finding we would have been money, if not fun,
ahead waiting and buying what we were after).  The rule of thumb is it is
less expensive to buy a race car than to build one.

It isn't clear why you asked this on the racing list, as you didn't mention
any racing goal.  The 911 list (which is a lot larger) might be a better
place to get more opinions on engines and the like.  If you do have racing
in mind, you need to get the rules from wherever you plan to race first
(SCCA, PCA Club Race, POC, whatever), then think about what motors
etc you want, no?  You need to build the motor to fit the class.
