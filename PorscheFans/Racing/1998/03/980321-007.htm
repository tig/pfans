Thom,

I don't know that I agree with all of this.

I can't imagine it being better to learn how to drive an inferior car
versus learning how to drive a well setup car. I am not talking about a
race car here. Just a well prepared near stock car. 

For example, let's take the 911SC. It comes pretty soft from the factory,
the ride height is too high, the camber is wrong, the gearing is even
worse, and the tires are inadequate. Take this car and put stiffer torsion
bars and sway bars, lower it, give it some negative camber, put a 7:31
ring and pinion in it, and put R1's or Hoosier's on it.

What have you really done here? You taken a car that will not behave well
at speed and is damn near unpredictable in some situations and made it a
car that is safe to drive and can handle high speeds on a race track. Not
only that, but the car will behave predictably in almost any situation you
an place it.

Which car is going to help the first time big track driver improve the
quickest? I don't think it is going to be the stock 911SC. I understand
that it is important to spend money on the driver, but let's not get
carried away with it and spread information that is just not accurate. 
Yes, it is fine to "make do with what you've got" but that does not mean
it is BETTER than making do with a well setup car. Learning to drive on
street tires well teaches to drive on street tires well. It does not teach
you how to drive on competition tires properly. The only way to learn that
is to drive on competition tires.
