Hi,

It's time to get the car track ready, I need some advice :

1. I have OMP seats, need to raise them and move forward.
Currently mounted on the bottom, will probably have to use
standard side mounts instead. I've found OMP aluminum side
mounting brackets for $105, does that sound like the best bet?

2. Anyone use the "Neck-Pro-Tech AR" combination of helmet
support collar and harness pads? My neck needs all the help it
can get and this seems convenient. Any good?

3. Any hints on best metal valve stems, cutoff switch,
and window net appreciated. Any good ideas for mounting
a window net in a car with a roll bar and diagonal
brace across the door? (minumum damage and maximum
safety of course).

4. Driving suit : The OMP "Trend suit" seems decent, any other
good recommendations?

I think lots of people would like answers to these questions
which all club racers need to contemplate so please reply
freely to all.
