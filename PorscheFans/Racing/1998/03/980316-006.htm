I frequently will share my ride with other people who I know are very
very good drivers (better than myself) and see what kind of times they
turn. If, after a brief familiarization with the car, they don't turn
times significantly faster than my own, then it's time to make the car
go faster. Either that, or they run times alot faster than my own, but
still slower than the rest of the class.

But that's just my opinion, what do I know... :)

As for knowing when you've maximized street tires? When you get sick and
tired of wailing tires and squishy sidewalls. ;) Actually, I'd say
you're at the limit of tires when you have them wearing evenly and
rapidly and are four wheel drifting out of every turn...
