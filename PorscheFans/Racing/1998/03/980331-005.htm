If stock they are 5.5 x 15 hopefully, or 4.5 x 15 (pre-73).

If you have 5" or wider rims the 205/50/15 BFG TA R1 would be
an excellent tire. They will be a bit wider than your 205/60s
but will be a lot lower so they may not rub.
I have a bunch of these tires with little tread but OK for a few
or maybe several (on a 914) autocrosses. If anyone wants them and 
can pick them up in Danbury, CT or pay shipping let me know.
Also a set of well worn 205/60/15 A008Rs.

I also have a N.O.S. 205/50/15 Yokohama A008R (1987 vintage)
if anyone is interested. As you can tell I'm a collector,
never throw things out. I should bring everything to the Hershey
swap meet!
