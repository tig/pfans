Hey all,

It was hard enough trying to figure out where to place jackstands
when I was doing the valve covers now I need to figure out best
placement for full car lift?

The jackstands I found some good places and used thick souled
shoes on top of the stands to make sure no denting or anything
took place. (If you haven't tried using your old tennis shoes as
jack,jackstand to car protection, try it!)

Anyways, I'm planning on replacing all my bushings with race
bushings and don't feel I can just jack it up in the garage to do
them so I was planning on taking my car to a friends shop and
using the lift. 
On standard X air and electric non drive on lifts that most shops
have, where do you support the car to lift it? I figure a drive on
one isn't going to work very well since I'm doing the suspension
components, which means removing them. Any help/suggestions would
be appreciated..

Thanks
