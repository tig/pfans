<<<Yeah, that's like this upcoming rule (Jan 1, 1999) on dedicated
raceseats with
slots for belts and backbrace attachments.  No rationale as to WHY at
all in
latest Club Race news.  What problem are we trying to solve, especially
in
stock class cars?  I though the rule on making sure the belts fit right
was
good enough.  Just another $400-650 to spend!  And the backbrace rule
doesn't
even have any requirements attached to it.  What does it have to be? 
What
does it have to attach to?  And I don't even remember dedicated
raceseats
being talked about in the safety questionaire we got.  Oh, well.>>>

I think it had to do with Mike Keller's incident at Pocono. I heard from
one of the racing supply stores that the car had a Recaro SRD and the
seat ratchet mechanism failed causing the seat to go horizontal.
Apparently, Mike hit his head on the passenger side door... Does anybody
have the lastest on how he is doing?

I am in the process of setting my car up for LRP on May 8-9. This
included the purchase of a Recaro SRD and _two_ back braces. I have an
email into Harry Hall asking for clarification that that SRD is OK for
next year. I haven't heard anything yet.

My problem is that I live in Manhattan so having two seats that I swap
at events would be a big pain. Since the car is a street/track hybrid,
going to a full-blown racing seat would be less than optimal for those
long hauls to Summit Point or Mid Ohio. I'd definitely prefer getting a
SRD-type seat, but I don't want to spend $800 this year only to find it
is no good next year...

Regarding seat back braces, this rule comes from the SCCA where the
problem of stock type seats going horizontal has been an issue for a
long time. There are those who think it doesn't do much good, but it is
now required. As I mentioned, it was my plan to use two braces to attach
the SRD to the roll cage.

Regarding this rule as it pertains to 914s in the SCCA, I'd be happy to
forward email to Richard Welty (Chief SCCA Tech/Scrutineer for the NE)
or to the wheel-to-wheel mailing list for clarification. I'm sure this
has been addressed since the 914 runs in IT.
