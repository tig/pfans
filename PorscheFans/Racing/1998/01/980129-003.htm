Sorry I havn't pitched back into this thread, work has been pretty busy this
week. I guess I was omitting the fact that in our "all things being equal"
format, the tire pressures were included in that. Yes, a narrow tire at x psi,
will deform more than a wider tire at the same pressure. Because the interior
volume increases with the wider tire, the overall air pressure holding up the
car will be greater. I guess I omitted that because for me I always considered
lower pressures when the tire width increases.

Yup. But depends on the track. Smaller tighter courses will probably reward
lower gearing more.

I do know that alot of SSB racers have claimed faster lap times at open tracks
(like stapelton) with 185/60-14 tires than with the 205/55-14 tires of the same
manufacturer. Pretty much the same gearing, but less drag and, more to the
point, less rolling resistance.
