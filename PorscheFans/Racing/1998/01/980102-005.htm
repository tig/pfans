Just a few snippets of information on a couple topics.

Teddy Bears:

I raced in G at Sebring this past year against the Erik(sp?).  It was
my first club race, so I did not expect to be up front.  In the less
wet sessions I was no where near him.  In the very wet qualifying
session, I was right behind him the whole time.  I think I may have
even out qualified him.  Anyway during the race, on a dry track, I
thought discretion was the better part of valor, and I moved to the
back of the pack.  His car did not appear to be any faster then mine,
but he sure drove better when it counted.  Even though I started last,
I caught and had a great race with two other G cars until my brakes
went out.  I then limped the car home.

Daytona:

I will be crewing for a GTS3 911 team.  I don't know the car number,
but we will have Olive Garden sponsorship.  Come by and say hi.  I
look forward to meeting other Pfans.
