I'll be there, crewing for a 911 team which is fielding the 
class-winning former Calderari (sp?) car.  Red car with yellow lower 
down on the car.  Wish us well - keep your fingers crossed!

Your mentioning Laguna Seca's unforgiving turn 9 is of particular interest to
me considering I still hold my breath through there. The fact that they leave
the ever so close concrete trough open for our "non-essential" racing events
is bad enough but having seen a few pack it into the wall is enough to keep me
very respectful!  While you are certainly right on target about the many
options available, and taken, through #9 it still amazes me the broad spectrum
of lines taken in #2. I cannot go 10 minutes in our afterhours partying and
benchracing without somehow getting into a debate about the fastest line
through #2.  Of course it doesn't help when you have 5 abreast trying to make
in and out the fastest (those starting laps are sure gnarly in those
decreasing radius corners eh?).

Hope you had a fun time with the POC this past Thanksgiving weekend as your
presence is always appreciated.  At least the weather held out for a wee bit
more than half of the 3 days. 

See you in '98,
Ross Clardy
