Jouko:

As the owner of a for the track only car, let me share a few thoughts.

You already have some very fine street cars, this will end up being a
dedicated track car.  As a dedicated track car you will get caught up in
the, more, bigger, faster, sickness.  You will, trust me.  Just by lookin=
g
at your street toys, and the fact that your thinking about a
track/street(ha!) car, means your a car person, you love this stuff.   I'=
ll
bet you watch racing on tv?  I'm sure this is your profile, I've seen it =
a
thousand times.

Now that we know what you are, and where you're going to end up (be hones=
t
here), save yourself a bunch of money and do it the right way.  Buy one
already made.  To take a street car or a roller and put the right stuff i=
n
it, you will end up over $30k.  Take your time, find a car that's
sorted/painted and with the right motor for what you want to do, throw it=

on a trailer (which means you'll need something to tow with) and have a
ball!!

Good luck,

Bill Rowell
