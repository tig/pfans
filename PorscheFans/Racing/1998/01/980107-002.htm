After getting used to high performance pads, I will never go back to street 
pads.  I have tried Portfield and Pagid for track pads and Metal Max for 
street.  My original plan was to swap back to the street pads after a track 
session.  I did this once and has amazed at the reduced braking of my car 
(a 93 968) so I put the track pads back on and have not looked back.  As to 
the squealing/squeaking issue, when I followed the factory specs of using 
and changing the brake pad vibration dampers with each change of pads the 
squealing/squeaking was no longer an issue.  Without those dampers through 
the Pagids sing like a wounded pig.

As to wear, I have not noticed there being additional wear due to the track 
pads.  I was also concerned as to the issue of high performance pads hot 
working well cold.  Well my experience has been their cold performance 
still outperforms street compound pads warm performance.  I live in 
Minnesota and am driving my car this winter, still no issue with the cold 
performance of the track pads.

Bottom line, I suggest you install the track pads with new vibration 
dampers and enjoy!
