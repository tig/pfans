* does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?

I learned today that we are *not* going to see the GT1's there this 
year - major bummer.  They're not competitive with the other cars in 
GT1, and Porsche as usual will not support a series in which they 
cannot clean house.  The Rohr car was there for practice, but will not 
be there for the race.

There are also very few GT2 entries, so few that apparently they may be 
bumped to GT1.

Personal opinion: I wish the Factory would get their collective heads 
out of the sand.  These series don't want turbocharged cars, haven't 
for years, and have only let Porsche in with their damned turbos, 
handicapped, to fill the field and to take advantage of a famous marque 
in terms of its draw.  It's a normally aspirated, water cooled, 
multi-valved world outside of Zuffenhausen...

VW's Home Page 2</A>    Also, I wrote a three part article on all three races,
May Silver State Classic,  La Carrera Classic and the Sept. Silver State
Classic.  Part one is in the current issue of the Porsche Owners Club
magazine, the other two parts to follow in the next two issues.  

Also, the Sept. race was featured on SpeedVision earlier this month five
times.  Its an hour long show!   To get a copy either contact SpeedVision.com
or Paul Thompson at prodymotor@aol.com.   If you are still having trouble
obtaining a copy, email me directly.  

By the way,  its out of this world and a 'must-do'!
