The following was posted several days ago on the 924-944 site. Several =
of the list members including myself will be attending. BTW, it's BYOO =
(B-ring Y-er O-wn O-ysters) in the infield (locals ONLY!):

You can see a team listing on the following page:=20

http://www.daytona24hr.com/cgi-bin/Team.asp

There will be two Porsche GT-1 cars there. Rohr will have a factory Evo =
GT-1
car. Champion will have a private GT-1 car there as well.=20

Damn straight BF is screwing himself. As a 15 year Daytona resident, I'm =
tired of being inundated
every year by rude, beer drinking, loud mouthed NASCAR fans that don't =
know a wastegate from a=20
toilet seat. Not to mention Yankees that insist on telling the locals =
how good things are up north,
Canukes that think the posted speed limits are in KPH, and spring =
breakers that prove Darwin was
right by leaping from balconies or playing 'chicken' when crossing A1A, =
thereby improving the
gene pool.

The 24 hr race is my chance to see the finest cars in the world (the =
ones that know how to turn right, as well as left)
without the aforementioned in attendance. I like to come and go as I =
please so I can feed my kids, walk my dog,=20
and take care of all the other BS. I shouldn't have to pay (yet again) =
for the right to enjoy my hometown.

And if Bill France is listening, he'd let the locals know how much he =
appreciates (or is he already doing that?)
all that we have to put up with every time he fills his coffers and =
offer a 'local discount' like everybody else in town does.

'Nuff said

And if you need a break, see:

BTW, please spend as much as possible so my taxes don't go up yet again =
to pay for all the=20
destruction wreaked by all the touristas.
