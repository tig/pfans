For the POC event, assuming you will not have gotten your POC slalom license
by then, you'll need to talk to Bill Bartee (POC Chief Driving Instructor)
and see if he'll let you run as a student.  Instructors will be
available, but only a certain number of students are accepted per
weekend, so you again need to check will Bill.  Contact information for
him should be available on the POC web site (http://www.porscheclub.com).

About $150 for entry fees for the weekend - more for non-POC members.

For any POC time trial, you will need:
	Snell 90 or better helmet
	Fire resistant (single layer) driving suit and gloves
	Full leather (or driving) shoes
	5 point harness (also required for passenger seat only if you
			 want an instructor)
	fire extinguisher rated 10BC or better

You may also have to get your car pre-teched.  Looking at the list of
inspection stations, I don't see any in Arizona at all.  I thought
Powerhaus was one (and thought they were in Arizona), but they aren't on
the list.  The worst case scenario would likely be you'd have to call the
eventmaster well before the event and arrange to have your car teched at
the track.

If you have more questions, please let me know.  Hope to see you there!
