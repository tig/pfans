I'm enjoying this "wider tires" thread. About 9 years ago we had this exact
discussion at work, although it pertained more to drag racing. Mark, a 
mechanical engineer, a car nut, was arguing that the width of the tires did not 
matter, it was a coefficient of friction. Charlie said it was a matter of psi. 
Mike called one of his drag racing buddies and explained why drag cars run very 
low psi and about the tires gripping the pavement. And the best, was Doug, who 
insisted that wider tires had to have more grip. Why? All you had to do was to 
go to any high school and look at all the fast cars - grey primered chevelles 
with Crager wheels and very wide tires!

This "discussion" was very lively and went on for a while. We kind of agreed 
that wider tires had more grip and that there was more to this and we were 
missing something. Mark was still insistant about the coefficient of friction 
theory. The next day someone had drawn a picture of a dragster with very tall 
rear tires. The driver was Mark. The tires where labeled as "Mark's old Van 
Halen albums".

This story is one of those "you had to be there" stories (besides, I'm not that 
good at telling them). But, this discussion has me in stitches remembering the 
drag car with "Van Halen albums for tires" picture, and Doug saying (with a
Texas drawl) "You can ask any high school kid about this".

Thanks,
