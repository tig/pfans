Note that the stock seats may, or may not, pass the PCA club race
tech inspection. It depends on the driver. The pca rules state:

--
APPENDIX B - SEAT BELT SPECIFICATIONS

ALL cars competing the PCA Club Racing Program must be equipped with a
five or size point harness system....

The design of 'high back' seats in later model Porsches can, in many
cases, render the shoulder harnes straps ineffective as they slide from
the shoulders under lateral loading. It is therefore mandatory that
seats which do not allow the shoulder harness straps to remain on the
shoulders in all situations be modified with a slot for the harness
straps to pass through, or be replaced with a racing seat which has a
provision for routing the straps. This is a mandatory modification
which must be completed before the vehicle will be elgible to compete.
A 'sternum strap' or similar colution will not be allowed!
--
Now, when my car was inspected for the Lime Rock Club race, the
inspector saw that my seat was stock, and did not have the slots. He
called Harry Hall over and Harry said "give him the test." This
involved me sitting in the seat with the harnesses fastened normally.
The inspected then shoved me around in the seat. If the shoulder
harnesses slipped off my shoulders, I would have failed. However, the
shoulder harnesses did not move AT ALL, my car passed, and I raced with
a stock, unmodified seat.

Will that work for you? I have no idea. I do know that I'm not a 
giant by any means. I am 5' 7", weight 165, and have a 42" chest.
You can try the test at home, sit in the car, and have a friend (?)
shove you around. See how that works.

One final note, I am buying a set of racing seats before this track
season. I don't think the stock seats are safe enough, snf they're 
too heavy. So I'm getting a Kirkey aluminun race seat.
