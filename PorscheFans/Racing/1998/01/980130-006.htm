OK, I'll bite - tell me how light they are (important for me!)
and how they will run on a stock MFI 2.7RS. 
Also if you have any real good lightweight headers that will work well. 
Price would be nice to know too, it is an object for me.

P.S. did you have success with that plastic bushing lube that we
talked about last year? I will need some soon for my sqeaky RS.
