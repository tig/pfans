Forrest,

Yes, I also have been thinking about this for a while.  As you know the
"independence" of area is an approximation and according to my old
schoolbook it is not good approximation for rubber and plastic material.

I haven't met anyone who has been able to answer this question to my
satisfaction ... maybe someone here on the list can (hope so)

But, as you know from various motorsports ie. Drag racing and Formula 1
racing.  The racers like to have the tires hot.  This indicates that warmer
rubber is stickier ... therefore more road friction but, that doesn't
explain the physics behind wider tires (or does it?, because sticky things
are dependent on area)

Best regards
Runar

So much for theory.  Can some kind soul share the real physics behind this?

Thanks!
Forrest

* does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?

I learned today that we are *not* going to see the GT1's there this 
year - major bummer.  They're not competitive with the other cars in 
GT1, and Porsche as usual will not support a series in which they 
cannot clean house.  The Rohr car was there for practice, but will not 
be there for the race.

There are also very few GT2 entries, so few that apparently they may be 
bumped to GT1.

Personal opinion: I wish the Factory would get their collective heads 
out of the sand.  These series don't want turbocharged cars, haven't 
for years, and have only let Porsche in with their damned turbos, 
handicapped, to fill the field and to take advantage of a famous marque 
in terms of its draw.  It's a normally aspirated, water cooled, 
multi-valved world outside of Zuffenhausen...

Hello Kevin

	I talked to the ROHR guys yesterday, they are indeed going to the 24 hours.
Who/where did you get your info from?  ROHR will be racing a Factory GT-1 EVO.
It is a new car from their last years GT-1 Yellow/Pirelli car. 
	Champion Porsche, in Florida will also be campaining a Porsche GT-1 car. 

	Yes - I have seen the lap times from practice on the Jan 10th. The Panoz cars
were indeed 7-8 sec faster per lap! 

	Panoz will have three cars for the 24 hours.

	There will be also one BMW/Meclarean.
