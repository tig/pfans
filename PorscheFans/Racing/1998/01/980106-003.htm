This also applies to all early USA cars. For example a '72 911S
is rated at 190HP (I believe this is SAE "gross" rather than SAE "net" HP).
I believe SAE "net" (like new cars) is about 180 and DIN is about 200.
Later cars like an '87 Carrera I believe are in SAE "net". 
I think the ratings are even more off on the
earlier cars, i.e. 60s cars that were often rated without fans
or accessories at least here in the USA. Maybe Porsche
was more honest the Ford and Chevy... 
I think DIN HP would be more useful as
I think there are factory specs on all cars available in DIN.
SAE net was never tested on early cars although there
may be a factor that can be used to get this number.
Using the same type of HP would make the numbers more
comparable and help the other inbalance in the rules which 
is free exhaust which helps later cars to a MUCH greater 
extent than early cars which already come with just about 
the best exhaust you can get.

But then again the classes are not purely made based on
HP to weight ratios, cars are moved when they seem better
siuted to another class ('74 US carrera, 944S2, 2.2S etc).
But using DIN HP in the charts might make the numbers
more comparable.

car!)
