DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Jan. 12, 1998) -- Donald E. Panoz has been elected 
to serve on the United States Road Racing Championship Board of 
Directors, completing the Board's lineup. Robert F. Snodgrass Jr. was 
named chairman of the seven-member board.

Don Panoz
courtesy Road Atlanta Panoz, who serves on the board as a track 
representative, joins competitor representatives Kevin Doran, of 
Doran/Moretti Racing, and Rob Dyson, of Dyson Racing; SCCA 
representatives Nick Craw, president and CEO, SCCA Inc., and Carl Haas, 
SCCA Pro Racing board chairman; track/promoter representative John 
Saunders, vice president of International Speedway Corp.; and at-large 
member Snodgrass, of Brumos Motor Cars Inc.

The USRRC plans to revive the Can-Am Series for sports prototype race 
cars, with its first event, the Rolex 24 at Daytona, scheduled for Jan. 
31-Feb. 1 at Daytona International Speedway. No further schedule 
information has been released.

"The USRRC will provide the North American sports car road racing market 
a stable and fertile environment to grow and ultimately reach its 
potential," said Panoz. "As a member of the USRRC Board of Directors, I 
relish the opportunity to return road racing to its former stature 
within North American motorsports."

Panoz's business resume outside of motorsports is diverse, as he has 
founded such ventures as Mylan Laboratories, Elan Corporation PLC, 
Chateau Elan, Sarazen World Open Golf Tournament; Aquatic Biohancement 
Systems, L'Auberge International Hospitality Company and Sequitor.

Panoz's holdings include automotive and motorsports ventures as well. In 
1988, Panoz Automotive Development Company was established, and has 
produced such automobiles as the Panoz Roadster, the Panoz Esperante and 
the Panoz GTR-1 race car. In 1996, Panoz purchased Road Atlanta in 
Braselton, Ga., and is in the process of upgrading the facility to FIA 
specifications. Panoz recently acquired the operating rights to Sebring 
(Fla.) International Raceway, which hosts the famed 12 Hours of Sebring. 
That race is scheduled to be held March 21, but was not originally 
planned to be part of the Can-Am schedule.

"Don Panoz is a man of vision, business savvy and dedication to 
motorsports. His inclusion on the USRRC board completes a dynamic 
balance of top competitors, track owners and sanctioning body 
administrators," said Snodgrass. "With the board complete, it has now 
begun to address a full slate of issues."

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (Dec. 21, 1997) -- The gelling of the 1998 USRRC season 
has begun.

The USRRC released the initial five venues of what it promises will be a 
10-event 1998 Can-Am and GT Championship season late Friday, including 
the Rolex 24 at Daytona, two six-hour races and two sprint events. The 
announcement came as critics of the fledgling alliance of some of the 
most powerful names in racing wondered whether a 1998 schedule would be 
organized before 1998.

Dust begins to clear for USRRC
The 1998 USRRC schedule begins at the 
Rolex 24 at Daytona, January 29-February 1, followed by a six-hour race 
at the Metro-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex, in Homestead, Fla. 
(date TBD), competing as part of the NTB Trans-Am Series weekend.

The USRRC will also join the NTB Trans-Am Series on two additional 
weekends, June 14-16 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, in Lexington, 
Ohio, and June 27-28, at the Sprint PCS Grand Prix of Minnesota, in 
Minneapolis, Minn.

The fifth confirmed 1998 venue for the USRRC will be a six-hour contest 
at Watkins Glen International, August 21-23, in Watkins Glen, N.Y.

"While we had wanted to release our initial schedule at an earlier date, 
we felt compelled to wait until we could announce venues with which we 
had firm agreements," said Alan Wilson, USRRC Operations Consultant.

In addition to the five initial races, negotiations with several other 
venues are continuing and the complete schedule will be announced as 
soon as agreements are finalized. The entire 1998 USRRC schedule is 
anticipated to include 10 venues.

Each of the five announced USRRC weekends will be sanctioned exclusively 
by the USRRC/SCCA Pro Racing. The Can-Am and GT series will compete 
together, but for separate series and class victories, at the 24-hour 
and six-hour races. The sprint-race weekends will feature separate 
contests for the Can-Am and GT series.

"Our goal for this inaugural USRRC season has always been to stage a mix 
of sprint races, six-hour and 24-hour endurance races on the finest 
North American road racing circuits," said Wilson. "Our initial five 
venues successfully begin this balance, and the additional 
to-be-announced races will complete the package, offering fans across 
the country the opportunity to watch the Can-Am and GT cars in a variety 
of race formats."
