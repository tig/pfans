To all,

I haven't had a chance to post to the list in several months, but you can
advertise Porsches and Porsche related items (parts, literature, wanted, etc)
in PML for free. Our magazine comes out monthly and goes to a very targeted P-
car audience. Ads need to be to us by Jan 25th to be in the Feb issue which
will mail around the 10th of Feb. You can email them.

Thanks and regards,

Phil Van Buskirk, PMLetter@aol.com

Hi,

>> The Jan/Feb issue of Grassroots Motorsports magazine has a quote from BFG's
race tire engineer Jim Fogerty. "Being able to drive to and from an event
is part of the idea behind DOT approved race tires. ...if used gently you
see 10,000 - 20,000 street miles." <<

This is not the same as DRIVING them on the street all the time.
The idea is to allow guys to put them on Friday or Saturday and drive
to the event to save valuable time. If driven on the street daily
you can have sidewall cracks or other failures.

Though I have ONLY TA R1s for my car I still do not recommend
using them as your only street tires. Besides they are no fun
at all as you can't slide them or drift unless you are crazy
enough to take on/off ramps at over 100MPH. Street tires
are a lot more fun on a balanced car.

I asked Jim Fogarty this question today and he agreed (I quote) :

" You are correct.  My comments were in regard to saving time at an event. 
We don't think people should use R1's as an everyday street tire.  But of
course, many people do.  But the concerns you mentioned are real.  And
anyone who runs R1's as their everyday street tire, will have to live with
those concerns.

But we don't think driving even a couple hundred miles to and from an event
on R1's, (in decent weather of course), is a problem.  But when you get
back home, change back to regular street tires for the daily drive to and
from work. "

So run them if you must but realize the consequences.

Subject: Various 914 recommendations (and some rambling)

Well the season is nearly begun and me and my faithful 914 (never a DNS or DNF
in 6 years) are looking forward to some great racing in
the Bay area (San Jose).  Except for the wet stuff, this is racing heaven.
Travel to Laguna Seca is 1.25 hours, Sears Point (undergoing construction for
NASCAR) & Thunderhill (now expanded to 3 miles) only about 2 hours.  I
attended a time trial and "gridded practice" at Laguna with the POC in Nov.
and I got to give them a hard time about how "long" the tow was for me.  They
all face a 6-8 hour tow to enjoy Laguna!  And Buttonwillow is still only 3
hours away except I don't have to face the grapevine.  I'm glad to give up So
Cal for the Bay Area.  Anyways, enough rambling...

The questions are the following...

1)  Who has the best bushing hard plastic bushings?  I am probably going to
use Weltmeister unless I get some better suggestions.

2)  The lightweight flywheels I see advertised are $350.  Is that a fair price
or should I be talking to a VW machine shop for a more affordable price.

3) Josh mentioned that 48mm throttle bodys are available.  Any contact names? 

4) Any recommendations for body shops in the bay area that can "bulge" my rear
stock fenders?  I can go to 7.5 inch rims (225/50 Hoosiers) for Club Racing
(class I).  I talked to Body Style and they indicated about $500-$600 per side
painted.  Ouch.

5) Anyone have a 1 sentence synopsis of what happened to porschephiles mailing
list.  The sys-op seemed to be a good guy and I enjoyed the list while I was
subscribed.

As always, TIA

Jon
