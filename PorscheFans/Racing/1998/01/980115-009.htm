Yes, that was my posting, based on conversations with event organizer and
the region president after the last director's meeting. However,
subsequently the board of directors have decided to reconsider the
situation, and a new proposal is being prepared for the next meeting at
the end of the month. (This is highly unusual. I never even considered
the possibility.)


Thus, the race is now neither on, nor off. I believe the date is still
being held by PCA for Tremblant. The track is booked. I *hope* the race
is on.


I *will* post back to the list as soon as I have definitive word (again,
<<cough>), which will be in two weeks. My apologies to those who have
changed their plans. I thought I was doing everyone a favour... 
<<sigh>.
