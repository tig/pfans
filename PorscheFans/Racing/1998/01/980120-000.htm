    In one sentence, Jon  :Stan Hanks (the Porschephiles
    list-master) went through an immensely unpleasant divorce which
    resulted in his losing all but one half-restored Porsche, all of
    his various businesses, a pile of friends, and TTA.COM. 

    He's now remarried and rebuilding... Last time I talked to him
    (back in September), he was living in Phoenix and about to move
    to Portland.
