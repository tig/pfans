Scott, 

	In my opinion, the best way to go is to buy a set of race pads, and
change them at the track. Race pads will not be as friendly to your
rotors, and will dust up alot more than a street pad. But a street
compound pad can get boiled away in very short order at the track.
Changing pads is not a big deal, and not only will it help your rotors
last longer, but could very likely save you at the track.

Hi gang,
I am looking to purchase a cut off switch for my '90 911C2.  Any
recommendations on what type of switch to get?  Any installation
recommendations?  I don't mind drilling a hole in the cowling (like dem real
racecars) as long as everythings passes inspection/tech.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

There were a few Carrera RS owners who I corresponded with
on the old list, or other people may be able to answer these
questions.

I just got a '73 911 converted to RS specs
(2.7 RS MFI, fiberglass bumpers, roll cage, etc).
I want to run it in PCA E (touring) or D (Lightweight) 
club racing class. Right now the car's weight is
approximately half way between touring and lightweight.

1. Did the '73 RS come with only 6" and 7" by 15"
wheels or were 7" and 8" widths also available?
Any difference in wheel size lightweight vs touring?
1" wider than stock are legal and 9s are on the rear now.

2. What differences are there in a lightweight
other than door panels, glove box cover, carpeting,
rear seats, and thinner sheet metal?

3. Does anyone know how much lighter a plastic
type rear window is on a coupe? How about rear
quarter windows (I think these can be changed legally
in stock?).

4. Any other legal ways to lighten the rear of a '73 911
coupe?

Skip:
I read your posting with great interest, although I personally favored the
RSII's before switching to Hoosiers. As you stated, they don't last long but
when they were new and used for the short sprint races they were faster than
the RS's - I just didn't expect much life out of them and certainly couldn't
use them for a longer race or Enduro.  Now I am dedicated to the Hoosiers for
Time Trialing and Cup Racing and haven't found a tire that matched their
characteristics or grip. But I haven't tired the Kumhos which offer a unique
265 size which will probably fit in the rear of a Carrera flare better than a
275/40/17. Can you comment on how  the "K" 's perform? Since I trailer my car
I don't care about street performance.

Thanks in advance for the continued assistance.
