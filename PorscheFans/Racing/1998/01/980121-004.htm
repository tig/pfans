This is an important point here. Tires are a conformable material unlike
something like metal or many plastics.

Classical physics dictates normal force and coefficient of friction to be the
predominant factors when calculating static and sliding friction (they _are_
different by the way). However, this is with respect to non-conformable
materials (solids). When the surface area of a solid increases, and the overall
mass does not, the force per square inch/cm/whatever drops. As a result, the
frictive force per area drops. But tires are not solid, and the rubber deforms
to fit the texture of the surface they are on. A good analogy is Velcro(tm). Say
you have a big square foot of of the loop part of Velcro, and two different
pieces of the hook part. One is about 0.25 sq. inches, and the other is 4 sq.
inches. You'll find that it will be easier to slide the smaller patch along the
surface of the loop material. This is somewhat analogous to the tire deforming
and grabbing hold of all of the little ripples and bumps in the pavement. If
you've ever put your hand on a hot racing slick, you'll know that this analogy
is very accurate. The first time I accidentally laid my hand on a hot tire, I
had two reactions. The first was "OW!" that tire is hot! The second was the
feeling of pulling a piece of duct tape off my skin. Yes, they can be
THAT sticky.

Huh? That makes no sense at all. Take a cylinder of a given diameter and length,
lie it on its side and measure how much of its surface is in contact with the
table or floor or whatever. Now cut that cylinder length in half, measure that
surface contact again. Which has the larger contact patch? Now this is an
extremely simplified argument, but all other things being equal, it is an
accurate representation.

However, in reality, contact patch calculation is _not_ a simple issue. There
are numerous factors to take into account. Tire pressure, lateral load, camber,
caster, sidewall flex, all of these will effect the overall contact patch. But
all things being equal, a wider tire will yield a larger contact patch.

Tires also have another very important factor to consider when determining a
size. That's heat. A tires stickiness, unlike Velcro, is very much temperature
dependent. As the rubber gets warmer, it gets softer, and will deform to match
the pavement more readily. Tires get heated by the friction generated from the
tire compound moving across the pavement. This is true on both macro and
microscopic scales. On the macroscopic scale, the tire carcass flexes as it
rolls, and this flexing generates internal friction which turns into heat. On
the microscopic scale, the tire compound is being squeezed into the surface of
the pavement and then lifted out, this is flexing the rubber itself generating
friction and heat. Both of these methods of heating apply to any and all tires
(some more than others), but the friction that is developed in both of these
circumstances is dependent on how much force the car can apply to the tire.
Vehicle weight comes into play here.

Given all other factors being equal: If the car is very light weight, and has
very wide tires, the force per area exerted on the tire is low, and the tire
will take longer to heat up. If the car is very heavy and the tire is narrow,
the force per area is high, and the tire will heat up much more quickly. Because
tires are temperature dependent, the bigger car will get more stick initially.
But as those tires continue to heat up, they may quickly go beyond the optimal
temperature. At this point the rubber literally begins to boil off the tire. The
tires get greasy, and that 'grease' forms a lubricating layer between the rubber
and the little bumps and irregularities of the pavement, making that velcro-like
adhesion more difficult. In addition, the rubber of tire is no longer elastic
and will tend to get pulled off the tire by those little bumps and stuff in the
pavement. On the flip side, the small car may not be able to get the tires hot
enough to where they are sticking as they should, and may never get the
performance that they expected.It's a balancing act. Too wide, and they never
heat up and get sticky. Too narrow, and they burn up and go away.

That's dilemma I'm facing right now with tire selection. Run 225s or 245s. The
245s have the larger contact patch, but distribute so much weight that they
simply may not heat up enough to be effective.

Howzat? :)
