As a "someday, wanna-be" club racer, I'm curious.  Is the "ideal" line ideal
for everyone and every car?  I was under the impression that the "ideal"
line varies depending on driver style, car set-up, race situation, day of
the week, moon phase, etc.  In fact, at DE events, different instructors
have taught me different lines through the same corners.  I've also been
lead to believe that the lines taught in DE aren't necessarily "ideal"
racing lines.  Perhaps Bob's unconventional lines are part of what makes him
faster than the average bear. Am I off here, or was Bob like wildly,
radically off the "ideal" line?  Just trying to learn...

I wouldn't be too scared of the Vikings.  Not that I don't root, root, root
for the home team, it's just that history has shown they're faily weak at
this time of year.

After reading a couple of posts on what is or is not a legal car I thought
about one person in particular.  This individual does very well in Club
Racing.  I'm convinced that a major portion of his wins are due to skill and a
willingness to push a little harder than most.  However, he is now taking a
7:31 ring and pinion out of his car because he is afraid of getting caught
this year.  At least he's admitting to himself that he is cheating.

Now how do we get the rest of the less than legal cars out there to switch
back?  Maybe there should be a 13/13 rule for cheating.  If you get caught
your out.  Or do what my friends advise, find someone to race with and have
fun!  God knows, most of us have enough pressure to deal with during the week.

Thanks.
