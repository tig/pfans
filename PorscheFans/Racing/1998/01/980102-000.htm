Dear Jon:
How pleasant to read such an intelligent posting saying so much yet humbly
formed in a cleverly written question. My $.02 worth - Personally I teach (as
a driving and racing instructor for the Porsche Owner's Club) that the
"correct line" is a function of the vehicle setup, driver style, track
conditions AND the intent or motivation of the driver at the time. It is this
last point I would like to dwell on here for just a moment. Is driver:
 1) seeking the fastest possible lap?
 2) protecting his position from competitor behind?
 3) preserving tires, fuel, engine?
 4) practicing alternative lines (several good reasons to do this)?
 5) avoiding certain areas or anomolies on the track?
 6) avoiding showing/teaching competitor's his lines (may sound petty to some
but I have suuccessfully protected some of my "secret" flying / qualifying lap
lines from my arch rivals for years)?

Oh, and BTW, if you checked out the last F1 event you saw the top 3 qualifyers
drive 3 different lines to achieve identical qualifying times. 

Happy New Year to you All!
Ross

p.s. hope to see some of you and these cars I hear about some day at a Porsche
Owner's Club event (www.porscheclub.com) and perhaps I'll make it to a PCA
Race Event in California this year too (it appears this year we won't have
schedule conflicts - yeah!).

As a "someday, wanna-be" club racer, I'm curious.  Is the "ideal" line ideal
for everyone and every car?  I was under the impression that the "ideal"
line varies depending on driver style, car set-up, race situation, day of
the week, moon phase, etc.  In fact, at DE events, different instructors
have taught me different lines through the same corners.  I've also been
lead to believe that the lines taught in DE aren't necessarily "ideal"
racing lines.  Perhaps Bob's unconventional lines are part of what makes him
faster than the average bear. Am I off here, or was Bob like wildly,
radically off the "ideal" line?  Just trying to learn...

Jon
