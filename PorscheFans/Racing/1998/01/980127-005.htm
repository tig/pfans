   Bryan,
the Kumhos are killer rubber for sure and you can most likely expect a little more wear than R1s. They will be easier to gradualy find the edge with than the R1s although the ultimate grip is very similar. Tire pressures should be very similar to the R1s. Camber might be optimal at just 5 or 10 percent more with the Kumhos than the R1s. You might just go up a couple pounds on the Kumhos over the R1s. The object will be to just cut 1/4" of the top of the arrow off the sidewalls on the Kumhos. But make sure you are doing it consistently and not just adding air because it rolled over onto the sidewall a couple times when you pushed a little or over steered a little.

Giddyuuup!!
