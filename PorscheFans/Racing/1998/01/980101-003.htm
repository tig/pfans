I would recomend the Yokohama A008Rs. It's a delightful tire on the
street and has better turn-in characteristics than the BFG. It does not
have the same amount of overall stick, but will last considerably
longer. The A032R I can't really say, but I have heard that it's
_really_ loud, lot's of tire noise. So for street driving it might be a
bit annoying. Also, the A008Rs will tend to be more forgiving than the
R1. The R1 (in my own experience) with its very stiff sidewalls yields a
slip-and-grip type of behaviour at the limit, and gives less warning
before it goes away.

Save the $60 for mounting and balancing. Just mount the wheels, go off
on your favorite nearby twisty road, get the tires nice and warm, go
home and take them off the car and let 'em sit for 48 hours. There,
you've just done the same thing, saved $60 and had more fun in the
process. If on the other hand, you're pressed for time, and need the
tires right away for an upcoming event, then maybe its worth it to you.
For me, $60 is three autox entry fees or two Solo Trials, or half a
track day. A better place to spend my money, IMHO.
