Re:  paul.foster@micromuse.com comment on cheating and gentlemen racers

I like Paul's comments. In San Diego, PCA has always had a difficult time with
the subject of protests. it DOES always leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
There have been suggestions that a simple accelerometer and scale would make
it easy to determine a weight/horsepower ratio to help classify cars. This
would reduce the need to tear down an engine, etc. Most of the rest other
potential "cheating" items, suspension, etc., could be checked without a
teardown.

Typically, if we think someone is cheating, one of our honcho's will have a
one on one, friendly conversation suggesting it might be time for them to do a
class change. That's usually enough to get them to make an adjustment or two.

Not an easy subject.

Howdy,
I can sell you a WIDE variety of racing seats. A decent inexpensive Cobreau
starting at $200 to a top end Recaro or Momo for $700-2000.  There are several
in between choices but the Corbreau's are a good entry seat.

Can anyone share with me the "factory" ride height for front and rear,
measuring something besides the bumper?  The technical specifications booklet
gives bumper heights but I find it very difficult to measure.

I'm also interested in hearing from some of you who've lowered the front and
rear.  Measurements from the ground to the crossmember bolts in front, and
wheelarch or shockmount in rear would be great!

Any handy dandy tricks for establishing 1 degree rake?

I'll have the car corner-balanced before any track use, but I'd like to get
the initial height set-up myself.

Thanks,
Jeff Fortenbery
