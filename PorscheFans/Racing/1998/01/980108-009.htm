I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has set up a C2 for =
Driver Ed and Auto-X. What springs/shocks do you use, did you change the =
sway bar, what width wheels work good for the C2, I only use Yokohama =
032's if it makes a difference?

In looking at a C2 how would I know if it had limited slip or the M030 =
sport running gear, were they available for the C2?=20

What does the M030 running gear include?

Does the RS America have the same brakes as the C2, I do know that in =
1992 the C2's rear calipers were upgraded.

Is there a good reference I could buy that would answer these questions?

I have heard a lot of talk of 993's losing control in the rear end, this =
discussion was that it let go with no warning and that this is a 993 =
trait, have heard of many accidents/spins blamed on this - anyone with =
993 knowledge have an opinion.

TIA
Abe Anderson
