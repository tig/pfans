I put it on every time I sit down at the 'puter. It's not SFI certified,
so I guess I take my chances... :)

Ahh, but F1, Indy, WSC, FIA GT etc. have their engines INFRONT of the
transaxle, like the 914. Not behind the transaxle, like the venerable
911. So who's feeling toasty now? Are you saying that the _911_ isn't a
"real race car"? BOY! How the tables have turned! :) :) Next thing ya
know, people will be calling the 914 the only _true_ Porsche! Nah.....
never happen. ;)

Like I said, I'm not a 911 guy (914s are my thing). But I just guessed I
would have heard more about it if it really were that prevelant of a
problem. I remeber hearing alot about M3 problems a while back.
