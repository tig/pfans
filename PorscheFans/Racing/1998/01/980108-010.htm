Well first off, what class do you intend on running in? That makes a big
difference with spring and wheel selction.

That's the first I've heard about it. Granted, I'm not a 911 guy
(engine's in the wrong place ;), but I have not heard a word about the
993 biting drivers. I've heard more about the M3 being unstable than I
have about the Porsche. And I doubt that the M3 is _that_ unstable.
