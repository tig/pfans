Hi fellow porsche fans,

        I have currently completed to the last step of my race car and I am
having trouble finding a fuel injection system that I can install that will
give my car the fuel it needs when it needs it.

        I have built a 3.3l twin turbo with Full race cams. We have it
running at 7.5:1 cmpression and 2 large turbos with a monster intercooler. 

        And we are looking for either a 935 injection system since they had
phenominal amounts of HP I figure they will have a type of injection system
I can use, or we are looking for some other kind of injection system that
will supply the fuel needed for a 550 - 600 HP motor.

        If anyone has any suggestions / help please E-Mail me at
saphy@gte.net or reply to the list I read the list everyday.

Thanks Chad

1979 935 Racing only (needs some kind of Injection)
