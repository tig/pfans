Dear David,

    Saw your message to Alan, and you mentioned Rich Howe of the now defunct
Howe Motorsports.  Well, boy have I got one for you.  I also made the mistake
of taking my car there, a 944 Turbo which I have increased to 2.8 Ltrs.   All
I wanted was his dyno tuning and some suggestions.  6 thousand dollars and
much heartache later, I got my 944 back, with oil leaks, wrong parts and ill
fitting panels put back into the interior.  To make matters worse, the motor
was weaker than when I originaly brought it to them, with an additional 2
thousand miles on the speedo.  (we had to test it out throughly, his partner
said.)

     I also was going to sue, however they are now out of business.  Disturbed
as I am, if I knew where I could locate him, I think I would buy a gun.  It's
guys like Howe that make the Porsche repair business a very sharp learning
curve and makes us distrust anyone else who we go to.

     Guess I have joined the club.  
P.S.
     If you know anyone who knows how to reach him, please let me know.  I
have this really big, mean friend.

Jim Fitzwilly
