   I'll have to watch it again but as I recall he was just looking rather
unfamiliar with the track. He was kinda doin middle track entrys and some
radical apexes and stuff, just not the kind of lines you would expect a guy
so highly thought of would run. Of course he did develop an engine problem
in the same session so maybe he was having a problem and was being
distracted for the 4 or 5 laps I was following? Maybe he was just being a
goof on purpose to give me and you something to talk about ;-)

or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
that important, now could it? ;-) white)
