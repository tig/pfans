I have a set of the fairly long stainless steel glasspack supertrapps
on my stock 1972 2.4S with MFI.
They have a flange welded on to bolt to the stock early heat exchangers.
These are 17" long and about $160 each in the Pegasus catalog.
They also make an extra short 10" long one. Mine do stick out
a bit and with my car VERY low will rub leaving steep driveways.

With a 2.4S with MFI they act very weird. I must run all disks (12?)
in order to get good power. If I remove disks I get a _severe_ bog
coming out of slow turns. But with all the disks in it is too
loud for the street or muffled track events (Lime Rock).

The power with supertrapps seems slightly better than the stock 
or sport muffler, though low to mid range torque is probably less. 
But I used the supertrapps mostly to remove a lot of weight 
from the far rear of the car which will outweigh the small torque loss.

With webers you may not have the problem when you remove
disks but you may, the only way to find out is to try.
You can remove several for street driving so you don't need
earplugs, and add them back for the autox.
