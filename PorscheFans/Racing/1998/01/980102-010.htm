   I have a pair of Sparco *PRO2000* racing seats that were installed in our 993 for about 2 months and have been replaced with EVOs. They are near perfect other than a 1/4" X 1" scrape in one seat under the cushion.

I would like to get $800 for the pair you buy shipping. I am in Seattle. My number is 253-279-9819 leave a message and I will return call after I am paged.

Trivia Fans,

Maybe a Euro 996 owner can answer this, or someone who has been to the LA 996
premier. A report?

A free after New Years aspirin to anyone who can tell me the Rear Wheel offset
used on a 996 with the Turbo Technology 18"  Wheel Option. The offset on the
rear wheel for the 993 Turbo is 65mm on the 10" wide wheel. 

Does the 996 use the same rear 18" wheel as the 993 Turbo? Note the front
wheels are slightly different 996 18" wheel option versus 993 Turbo: 7.5
versus 8.0J respectively.

Thanks.
