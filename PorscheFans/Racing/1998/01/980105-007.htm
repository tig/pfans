Caster? You do mean camber, right? And if people are running too much
negative camber then it's no wonder that they're wearing out
prematurely. When my tires cord it too is usually near the inner edge.
My guess? Because a certain amount of static camber is dialed into the
suspension, the contact patch is reduced when pointed straight ahead.
This can be a problem for powerful cars with too much camber on the
drive wheels (many of our fellow P-cars, not me though... no power.).
And it can also be problem under heavy braking. I found that with my old
setup I was always cording the fronts before the rears, and no it wasn't
due to flatspotting the tires. 

For me, the cord would show up just outboard of the inner groove. I
concluded that it was alot of hard straight-ahead braking that was the
cause. Maybe I'm wrong, but since I upgraded the suspension the problem
doesn't seem as severe. My guess? The stiffer front torsion bars don't
allow as much dive and hence there isn't as much compression related
negative camber. 

Of course, I could be totally full of it too...
