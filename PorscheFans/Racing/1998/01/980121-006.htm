   There is a fellow named Rupert Bragg-Smith in Las Vegas and he teaches techniques that work in all cars to help you go fast safely. He has helped me a lot and the cool part is you spend tons of time on the track in a new Corvette rather than some limp ass mustang or tauras. 

   Yeah yeah yeah, I know it isn't a Porsche but the principals are all the same and you will be taught the two most important things IMNSHO which are vision and balance. These are the things that will make you fast and safe. If you go to *http://www.teamzr1,com/* you wil find a link to info for Rupert. 

   My experience with Rupert was at a club race having never seen the track before I ended up winning my class and group

BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be that important, now could it? ;-) white)
