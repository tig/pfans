Jerry, I'm not sure I would recommend slathering ball joints (or heim 
joints, monoballs) with grease.  Rather than protect them, the grease 
is more likely to retain and perhaps wick in grit.  If anything, I 
would try to fit a boot around the Fabcar monoball, if one could be 
made to truly seal and not merely act as a good collector of water, 
dirt.

Where does one mount the cyl. head sensor(s) on a 911 to best monitor the
temperature? Is one sensor sufficient or should I put one on each bank? each
cylinder?

Thanks

I agree with you. The point I was trying to make is that if you put trick
parts on your car that require race car maintenance, such as unprotected ball
joints, you had best be prepared to service them as you would any critical
part of a race car. I know of too many cases where guys are running around
with FabCar arms on the street. They have installed them because they heard
they were the best but they ignore a stringent maintenance regimen. We both
know the consequences of poor hygiene on precision parts. Especially ones that
are unprotected from the elements.
Another example is the braided stainless brake lines that are all the rage.
There are too many street cars running around with those on because the owners
thought they were "trick" and inexpensive. If I recall we beat that topic to
death about a year ago.
Long time no talk to!
Regards, 
Jerry
