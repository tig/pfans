In a message dated 98-01-26 13:48:25 EST, you write:

<< Saw the illustration, I tend to not agree. If we take all factors to be
equal
 save that of tire size, the patch _will_ be larger. The illustration implies
that
 the longitudinal dimension will shrink as the transverse dimension grows as
tire
 size goes up. How would this happen? If tire pressure were significantly
 increased so that the tire carcass deforms less from the weight of the car,
or
 the diameter of the wheel/tire were decreased so that there was less tire
 contacting the ground. But neither condition is permitted in our "all factors
 being equal" argument.<<

 I'm not sure my drawing transferred well to the list. It must have to you.
You got the idea. The length and width of the patch does change with the tire
sizes. Ponder a corner of a car that weighs 600lb and a tire on that corner
with 30 psi(pounds per square in.) in it to hold up that corner. The contact
patch is 20 square inches(600divided by 30). If you put 30psi in an equal(same
construction, etc.) only wider tire to hold up the corner, the patch will
still be 20 sq. in.. This may be bothersome to some because the "air tank" of
the wider tire will be larger, just remember, we're talking psi.

<< Yes, the wider the tire on a given wheel is not always going to be the
best. It's
 a point of diminishing returns. On a fixed wheel width, the tire will have to
 pinch to fit on a narrow rim, and will tend to round the tread surface. And
this
 _cannot_ be ignored when considering tire/wheel sizes for competition
purposes.
 Wider tires on a given wheel will eventually approach a limit as to what size
 contact patch can be created until the tire can not fit on the wheel.<<

 You're right about rim and tire width compatibility limits. The law of
diminishing returns applies.

<< Ideally, in competition, a tire should be mounted on as wide a wheel as it
can be
 stretched onto. But let's take an extreem real world example. My car,
currently
 running on 6" rims. I could mount anything from a 165 to a 225 width tire.
Are
 you going to argue that the contact patch for a 165 width tire is the same as
a
 225 width tire? Do I claim that a 225 squeezed onto a 6" rim is ideal? No.
 Ideally, I would want to stretch the tire onto a 9" rim. But for now, a 225
on a
 6" rim is as much as my stock fenders can accomodate. As the size of the tire
 increases, the rim width should increase along with it.<<

Those size differences are extreme but, yes I would argue that the patches on
the 165 vs the 225 would be the same area, if you could get tires of the same
construction in those sizes and put them on a rim of median compatibility to
both sizes. On 225s vs 245s or even 205s vs 245s I'd guarantee it. However,
you can oversize or undersize a rim to the point where the tire itself and not
the psi is holding up the corner.
 BTW I think you had mentioned 225s and 245s and heating them up. Always use a
pyrometer to check the "heating up" some people gauge this by the rise in tire
pressure and as I mentioned earlier the larger tires have a larger "tank" thus
they would take longer to increase in pressure due to heat.
