    I've been following this thead about wider wheels and it doesn't seem to
make sense with what a lot of us have experienced at the track.  If I under
stand your arguement  a 205 mounted on a 8" rim would have the same contact
patch( and same grip) at a constant psi as a 225, except this is certainly
not my experience.  Therefore, if I understand correctly, a car, lets say a
carrera( which I have experience with), with 205 &225 on 8's and 9's should
have the same contact patch( and grip, eg; handling, lap times etc.) as 245
& 275 mounted on the same.  But this is not reality!  There is a significant
difference in handling, lap times etc..   even though the 275 is a taller
tire.  I'm speaking of R1's ,Hoosier's or probable any other tire.Your
arguments certainly sound logical but....<<

No. No. I don't think anyone said same "grip". Just same size patch in a
different shape. One could find an underlying message in the thread that the
shape of the patch _can_ make a difference in the grip, handling, lap times,
etc.. This is probably what most of us have experienced and why we use them.
With wider tires the patch shape reduces fore and aft and increases side to
side thus should handle lateral loads better and give better handling. BTW
taller tires vs shorter tires can affect lap times due to the gearing change. 

As for Keith's gas mileage question I would hazard a guess that drag created
by the greater frontal area of a wider tire and its additional weight, might
adversely affect mileage but only a small amount. I don't know about the
different shape patch affecting mileage.
