<< Subject: Fabspeed C2 Exhaust and chip
 
  I am searching for an excellent exhaust and chip for a 92 C2? My plan is to
 just replace the two mufflers and not the headers.
 
 I like what I see from Fabspeed Motorsport located in PA, at least in their
 ad - does anyone have any experience with them - good or bad?
 
 Has anyone compared them to B&B? >>

I had a B&B muffler with their cat bypass tube on my 93 RSA.  That combination
with a stock factory 92 DME produced as much hp as the car did when I switched
to a set of B&B headers and muffler, same chip.  The headers did have a little
more grunt in the midrange and I did lose weight in the right place.

I got an Autothority chip from a company which didn't want to stand behind the
chip.  The chip lost hp.  However, after a call to Autothority they programmed
a new chip for the car with the setup I had and it worked much better, about
12 hp.  The loss and gain were later re-confirmed on a chasis dyno, same day.

I think I still have the second generation chip.  The first is resting in a
land fill.

Hope this helps.
