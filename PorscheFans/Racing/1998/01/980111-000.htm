Hi Sherwood:

   Two different methods prevail in attaching the thermocouple to the
head.
One's easy. the other's much more difficult.

Easy method:
Use spark plug thermocouples that sit on the plug bases where it screws
into the head. This doesn't seem to change the plugs' operating heat
range and works real well. The thermocouple ring slides over the plug
threads and then you insert into the hole. This type of connection
reacts the quickest to changes in temperatures.

Tougher method:
Drill and tap each head for a screw-in type thermocouple. Obviously one
removes the engine from the car to perform this operation.

If one can afford it, having six thermocouples would the the way to go!.
This makes a dandy diagnostic tool as well. Several aircraft suppliers
such Electronics International make a unit that displays temperatures on
a bar graph so that you can see all six cylinders displayed in a row.
Its not cheap, but quality never is...............

For single probe applications, measure each cylinder's operating
temperatures to find the hottest running cylinder to permanently attach
the thermocouple to.

Hope this helps,

For those of you that inquired about using braided stainless brake lines I
will give you a quick synopsis, to the best of my recollection, of an
extensive discussion we had when this group was called Porschephiles.
It seems that allot of people, many who are not taking their cars to the
track, have installed braided stainless steel brake lines because they thought
it would improve their pedal feel or they just thought it was an inexpensive
modification that made their cars seem racier. Most people thought you can
install these items and forget about them. Most people get away with this
philosophy but it is not necessarily true.
Using parts designed for racing usually means that you have an item that
requires race car maintenance. This means frequent inspection and replacement
at the first sign of trouble. This is food for thought. When I was in charge
of teching cars for track events for RTR region myself and my team found quite
a few cases of unsafe stainless steel brake lines. They presented as twisted,
chaffed, or were separating themselves at the connections. We had 2 fairly
serious incidents, over 2 years, of brake failure due to the failure of these
lines. It seems that many of these items were installed improperly (for
instance twisted) or were of questionable quality. True race cars and those
that are used for racing and street need these items inspected regularly and
replaced. Many race teams replace these lines on a regular item as a routine
maintenance item. They just cannot be taken for granted. You may get away with
it but the downside is not pretty.
The consensus of the group (not just myself) was that in the majority of
instances you were better off with factory brake lines that were in good
condition. If in good condition the pedal feel will not be appreciable
different from the braided lines and they are safer. It is also easier to
inspect factory lines because small cracks in the rubber are easily spotted.
It's real hard to see the rubber lines underneath the stainless braid on the
braided lines. 
I am aware that we now have DOT approved after market lines but I cannot
comment on those since I have no experience with them.
If anyone remembers that discussion feel free to jump in and correct me if I
am being inaccurate. 
Nuff said, 
Jerry

Hello P-Fans
	This last post reminded me of a freind who lives in Santa Barbra, CA. He own
a 2.0L 914, and a service shop (Snieder's AutoHaus, in Santa Barbra) installed
a new cylinder head temp switch and mounts it to the head in a different spot
a little further away (an few inches?) than the OEM spot. This give the engine
a slightly richer mixture (since the temp sensor is further away from the
heat)  which is just what the engine needs in this case. 

	Just thought I'd post this for any budding 914 owners out there....
