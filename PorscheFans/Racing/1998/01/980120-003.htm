Weltmiester is pretty much the standard. There are a few companies that offer
machined delrin bushings. The machined bushings repotedly fit alot better than
the molded poly bushings. I don't remember the exact rpices, but I seem to recall
that they weren't too much more than the welt stuff.

Hmm, depends on the manufacturer. The racemaster stuff is pretty high quality
from what I hear, but they make very light flywheels and I've heard that you
don't want too light of a flywheel. I havn't experimented yet, but by research
has shown me that 10lbs is really the bottom limit.

Try Rich Bontempi at High Performance House in Redwood City. HPH is not a cheap
place, but Rich and Larry are probably two of the most informed 914 guys that I
have ever talked to.

$500-$600 per side is pretty much the best pricing I've found. Unless you feel
like just doing the baseball bat technique, expect that to be the general going
price.

Andy summed it up pretty well. We all hope to see Stan back on-line someday.
