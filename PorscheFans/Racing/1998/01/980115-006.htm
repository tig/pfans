   Hey prepared racers out there,
I just got my reply from Harry Hall and as soon as we get our new rule books it will be in there as a legal mod for a prepared car to change our flywheels to a lighter unit.

   Man I was startin to feel bad cuz I know of a bunch of other guys racing in prepared classas that have light flywheels including yours truly. I was sure I had asked Harry about this as I am very intent on having a car that fits perfectly within the letter and spirit of the rules.

   When I saw the post from someone saying this was not legal I was worried big time ;-( Although the guys I raced against last month said they had light wheels too I was not wanting to run illeagal. Anyway, the word from Harry is it is AOK ;-)

Giddyuuup!!

BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be that important, now could it? ;-) white)
