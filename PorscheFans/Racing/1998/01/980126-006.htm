OK I'm late but I've got to get in on this.

Then Josh wrote:
>>Huh? That makes no sense at all. Take a cylinder of a given diameter and
length, lie it on its side and measure how much of its surface is in contact
with the
table or floor or whatever. Now cut that cylinder length in half, measure that
surface contact again. Which has the larger contact patch? Now this is an
extremely simplified argument, but all other things being equal, it is an
accurate representation.<<

I agree with Forrest. As Josh says the cylinder example is simplified. It
overlooks the many factors involved. Given all factors are equal, car weight,
wheel size, tire construction, etc., a wider tire only changes the shape of
the patch, not the overall size. Instead of a squarish patch you might have
with a narrow tire, with a wider tire you would get a more rectangular patch.
(see cheap illustration)

 Again all things equal, there will be no increase in the total contact area
of the patch, just a different shape. I think the increased patch conception
is common because people usually see increases in contact patch by adding
wider wheels at the same time as tires. There is something to be said for
changing the patch shape to the wide tire example though, since it would
appear to handle lateral loads better.
