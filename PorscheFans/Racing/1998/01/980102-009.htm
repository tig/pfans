I've never been persuaded that Colorado folks gave much thought to their
legislation. Read on..

> LEGISLATIVE NOTICE
> 
> BILL TO PROHIBIT ALTERED SUSPENSIONS
> APPROVED BY COLORADO REVIEW COMMITTEE
> 
> The Colorado Legislature's Transportation Legislation Review Committee
> has
> given preliminary approval to a draft bill that would prohibit any
> person
> from operating a motor vehicle on a public highway if the configuration
> of
> the vehicle has been altered from the original manufacturer's
> specifications. This measure is specifically designed to ban vehicles
> with
> altered suspensions, but also pertains to tire or wheel size, body
> height,
> chassis configuration and steering system. Violators could face fines of
> up
> to $1,000.
> SEMA supports reasonable and relevant safety laws regulations at both
> the
> state and federal level and supports the model raised vehicle regulation
> recommended by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
> Like some other states, however, Colorado appears poised to impose
> unnecessarily restrictive and burdensome vehicle suspension requirements
> without substantiating its claim that the legislation will improve
> highway
> safety or provide other tangible benefits. In addition, it effectively
> defers to the vehicle manufacturers to set the standards.
> While this bill has not been formally introduced and Review Committee
> approval does not ensure passage, we are extremely concerned that action
> on
> the legislation may become an immediate priority when the legislature
> reconvenes in January, 1998. We will be forwarding additional
> information on
> this important bill in the near future. In the meantime, please feel
> free to
> make copies of this notice for distribution to all interested parties.
> For more information please contact stevem@sema.org.
