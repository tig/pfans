I had my tire problem in August. I bought the tires from the BFG
truck for the Pocono club race. I mounted all 4, heat cycled them
as best I could at the time (which was not very much, I admit), then
used the tires for Friday practice and Saturday racing. After I
got home, I had about 3 weeks before my next track event. When I
was tech inspecting the car, I discovered that the LF tire has patches
of cord showing. Now Pocono is a mostly left turn track. The inside
tire, especially the outer edge of the LF tire does very little.
The other three tires looked great.

Anyway, I tried calling someone at BFG. I got transferred to Dave
Sanders (head of BFG motorsports) number, and I left a message. 
He didn't call back. I left another message, he didn't call back.
Finally, he was supposed to call me. He didn't. I wrote a letter,
including pictures of the defective tire, and the other tires. In
the letter I included my pyrometer readings, alignement settings,
et all. I did receive a very nice response from Mr. Sanders. But
instead of agreeing that I received a defective tire, and offering
me a free tire (I didn't even ask for a free tire, I just wanted
one at a pro rated price), he argued that it was my fault that the
one tire was out of tread. That's fine, but I won't use BFG tires
anymore.

In my friends case, he bought a set of tires, used them at Bridgehampton
for 1 day, IN THE RAIN! The next day, one of the tires has a spot,
the size of a quarter, where the tread was missing, there was a
patch of cord showing. Again, BFG's response was "too bad on you,
these are competition tires and have no warrentee." I know of 
number of other people who have had similar problems.
