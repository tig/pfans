Caveat Emptor!

I looked at this product the last time someone asked about it. In my opinion (and
we all know what that's worth) this is total snake oil. However, they cover their
butts pretty well. Notice that the power gain claims "0-35 gain". So if you don't
gain any power from it, you can't turn around and claim false advertising. Sure,
if your particular engine design could benefit from added intake turbulence, then
maybe it will give you some marginal improvement. And also note that they don't
specify what engine(s) this performance advantage comes from. An 800ci dragster
engine? Sure, 35hp is a pretty inconsequntial number when you're dealing with
1000hp+ engines. 3.5%, that's less than day to variances in atmospheric
temperature and pressure will give your engine.
