A friend of mine shipped his 2.7 RS over to the States to run this race
a year or two ago.  Here's what I remember of it...

The scrutineering (pre tech) is very rigorous.  They will assign a "Tech
Speed" for your car.  There are a small number of radar traps on the
course, and if you exceed your Tech Speed, you're disqualified.

I also believe that the cars/drivers must be checked out prior to the
race on a closed course.

You'll be assigned to a speed class...  The object of the race is to run
the entire distance (something like 90 miles) at your assigned speed and
'hit' an exact time for the run.  Class winners are generally within a
handful of seconds of their target times.  Naturally, this takes a well
calibrated rally computer to be competitive.

Like a rally, you have both a driver and navigator for the race. 
(Personally, I think the driver has the easy job!)

My friend ran his RS in the 120 mph class with a Tech Speed of 130 or
140 mph.  He placed well (3rd?) with a run speed of about 121 mph.

Depending on how your 993 is prepared, you may find your Tech Speed to
be surprisingly low (they are VERY concerned with safety). Out of the
showroom, I'd guess a 993 would get a Tech Speed of around 100-110 mph. 
To qualify for the Tech Speed a 993 is capable of, you'll need a fully
prepared race car: full rollover protection, fuel cell, etc..  Also, if
you do get into a higher speed class, then the job of the navigator
starts getting rather important.

Of course, there are people who blow through the speed traps WAY over
their Tech Speed.  The race organizers do frown on that because it's not
a race track...  There's no kitty litter to sink into, no tire walls... 
just a bunch of desert that would love to eat you & your car.

If you're really interested in doing this, I may be able to dig up some
contact info for you, so you can reach the race organizers.

Cheers,

Bill
