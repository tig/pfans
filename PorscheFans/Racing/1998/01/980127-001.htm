Barry Lenoble responded:

<<Now, when my car was inspected for the Lime Rock Club race, the
inspector saw that my seat was stock, and did not have the slots. He
called Harry Hall over and Harry said "give him the test." This
involved me sitting in the seat with the harnesses fastened normally.
The inspected then shoved me around in the seat. If the shoulder
harnesses slipped off my shoulders, I would have failed. However, the
shoulder harnesses did not move AT ALL, my car passed, and I raced with
a stock, unmodified seat.

Will that work for you? I have no idea. I do know that I'm not a 
giant by any means. I am 5' 7", weight 165, and have a 42" chest.
You can try the test at home, sit in the car, and have a friend (?)
shove you around. See how that works.>>

Please note that Barry has very wide shoulders which is what is required
for this to work. I heard someone on the west coast had to cut his stock
seat at the event in order to compete. Caveat vegomatic.
