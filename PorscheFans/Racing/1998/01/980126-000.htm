Peter,

	I went on a CV grease hunt back in January, and after a "long talk"
with a Mobil Co. chemical engineer (Make that more than you ever wanted to
know about CV grease), I bought a 36 LB drum of the grease he recommend. It
is manufactured by Quaker State for use in the trucking industries, it has a
very high "tack" coefficient as well as a high suffer content.

	I resell at my cost 3 LB tubs (about 1.1 quarts) at $10.50 plus
shipping & handling ( $5 for 2nd day Priority mail). If you are interested
feel free to contact me via e-mail of my office phone below. If you are
interested in more than a tub, I will be glad to forward the QS part number
on.

	Regards *,

Dan

	Hi All,  A few years ago I used a type of grease for wheel bearings
and
	CV's called Almaguard. It is a red colored VERY high tack grease.
Can
	anyone help with where I might be able to purchase a few tubes?
Thanks,
	Peter
