Hi Josh:

I asked the same question last year since I'm also adding a trick VDO
cylinder head temp gauge set up to monitor all 6 cyls and Steve Weiner
responded with the following:

"Cylinder head temps will scare you at first. The redline for cylinder 
heads is about 450 degrees. I like to see about 325-350. Best power and 
fuel economy is in that range. The temps will change when you lug the 
motor. Lower RPMS and high loads will really push those up very quickly.
This is one reason why the factory used a flat fan for best cooling. 
That provided the most even airflow over the heads. The other most 
overlooked factor regarding cylinder head temps are the rubber boots 
aroung the plug connectors. These seal cooling air into the hottest part

of the engine, the heads. Its amazing how people don't inspect and 
replace those cheap item often enough. That's because they have never 
observed cylinder head temps before either on a dyno or in a car.

If I saw the temps going over 450, I might remove foot from the throttle
and let  it cool off with the engine running at no load."

Of course, this info was for a 911, don't know if it applies to your 914
though I'd guess both engines run similar temps being similar 
air/oil cooled design.
