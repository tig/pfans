This is an answer to Azim Sahu-Khan about the Weltmeister Adj sway bars
on a 944.  I have an early car and I don't think I will use one.  The
original bar has two holes in the A arm to mount it.  The Weltmeister
has one hole in the center of the A arm.  If you do this what you are
doing is perforating the A arm.  I had a friend break an A arm at this
point using a Weltmeister at Indianapolis Raceway Park last fall.  I
have a Turbo Cup Bar on my car and I mount it to the original mounting
point.  I had to drill the bushing out to fit the 28 mm bar, but Joe
Cogbill (PAP, Atlanta) said it was better to use rubber bushings as they
were easier on the A arms.  I have a Weltmeister adj on the rear which
enables me to adjust the suspension.  I think it works pretty good.

By the way, I noticed several people asking about delrin bushings.   I
tried them on my early 944, and the one that mounts the A arm to the
crossmember broke after about 2 races.  There is a raceshop in Franklin
Tennessee that will mount heim joints in this position and they work
great.  They make no noise and are much stronger than delrin.  I use a
Weltmeister for the trailing part of the A arm and it works great.  They
have been in for 3 seasons and are like new.  I replace the ball joints
every year.  Earl at Action Engineering in Franklin Tennessee charged me
$143 apiece to put the heim joints in including the joints.  Call him at
615-790-6828.
