Chad, there are many FI systems out on the market that can deliver what
you need. Accell, Electromotive, Haltech, and MoTec are all capable of
handling an engine that has the thirst for fuel like yours. 

But the FI brain alone is not suffiecient as I'm sure you're aware. Most
of the modern FI systems (like the ones I mentioned) are fully
programable for both fuel and ignition maps. With a turbo motor like
yours, ignition controll should be a must. These systems are designed to
utilise most common sensors available in the market. They can run
open-loop, or closed-loop with an O2 sensor. The three crucial elements
you'll need in addition to the brain are a 2 or 3 bar MAP sensor, an
adjustable high pressure fuel pump, and big high flow injectors.

Awsome. Sounds like a killer motor.

But the 935 is a reasonably old model and the sophistication that's
available nowadays is pretty far beyond what was available 10 years ago.

If you're looking for the best system, then look into the MoTec system.
Definately one of the best systems out there, you get what you pay for.
And it will cost a bit.
