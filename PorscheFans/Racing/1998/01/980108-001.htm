OK, here comes that darn ignorance thingie, but that is why this list is
SOOOOOO wonderful!  WHAT vibration dampers...are the remnants that
black, gooety stuff on the OEM pads I took out that I have thought
HMMMMMM? about many times.
Where do I get "new" vib. pads?  How much?

Our Experience with brakes FYI:
We have found that if you champer all the edges on new brake pads and your
rotors aren't grooved we don't get squeelin' pads. We used Cool Carbons and
now Porterfields (with virgin Motul, Holbert cool ducts, dust shields removed)
and they hold up just fine to the rigors of racing at Laguna Seca and yet are
fine on the street too. With stock Carrera calipers on AJR drilled Carrera
rotors I've gone through two sets of rotors with Zero cracks in 5 1/2 seasons
(~ 25 time trials and /or sprint race weekends). Am I lucky or is this just a
great combination (of course a lot of those events were at Willow Springs and
I tend to avoid the brake pedal there ;-) ....?
