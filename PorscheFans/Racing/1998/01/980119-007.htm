<<does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?
just read this weeks autoweek and sounds like a real mess out there.>>

Is that a weather forecast or are you talking about all the controversy?
;-) Rest assured the SCCA will screw the pooch - they always have and
they always will. But it may take them a few years...

There have been a couple of reports on w2w about the practice sessions
earlier this month from Gerry Green. Everybody was there and it looks
like it is going to happen. If you are interested in the writeups let me
know and I'll pass them along privately.

Card carrying member of the SCCA for over ten years. Sigh.
