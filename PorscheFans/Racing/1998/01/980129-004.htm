Steve Greenland responds:  

<<That's because the grip=contact-patch=weight/pressure argument is a
simplistic static analysis of something that is a complex dynamic
problem. (Even removing the "grip=" part of the above overly simplifies
the problem.)

(No, I don't know how to do the correct analysis -- I just know the
static analysis is misleading.)>>

The 'static analysis' you are referring to is insufficient not because
of dynamics, but because it expresses the 'theoretical tire'. The
theoretical contact patch is determined by the weight on the tire and
the pressure within the tire. This model holds true for inner tubes. The
factors that are missing from the high-technology tires of today are
that the manufacturer can 'force' the shape and size of the contact
patch by the molding process and the construction of the sidewall. 

The width of the wheel is also important to maximize the contact patch.
If you try to fit an overly large tire on a wheel that is too narrow,
the contact patch will shrink because the wheel will distort the tire.
This doesn't mean that you should try to avoid this since most classes
restrict the maximimum width of the wheel, it just means that you would
have an even larger contact patch with a wider wheel. 

The dynamics really don't change things that much other than to increase
or decrease the size of the contact patch on a given tire at a given
time due to weight transfer. This is the factor that is of primary
concern to us - driving at the limits involves good contact patch
management more than anything else.
