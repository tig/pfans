From what I've heard about the G-force tire it's a very different tire
than the R1 and really can't be compared. For starters, it does NOT have
the asymetric sidewall construction of the R1. Good in the sense that it
will be a more forgiving tire (less twitchy), bad for people who are
limited on how much camber they can set their car up with. Second, just
because it has less tread depth, doesn't neccessarilly mean it has less
rubber. The Hoosier, for example, has next to nothing in the way of an
actual tread depth, but has plenty of rubber underneath. So in effect it
becomes a DOT radial slick.

That's my understanding too. Harder compound, and quite noisy.

I find that response very very unusual. I have had great dealing with
BFG, and I'm not a sponsored driver, nor have I even won contingency
money from them. As far as quality control, this is the first I've heard
of it regarding BFGs. Yes, in the past (first R1s) there were some
problems. But that was long ago and a different tire. The only time I've
heard of R1s dying prematurely was when the EGOD happened, and that's
not a tire construction problem, it's a setup problem.

I've heard some good stuff about them. Scotty seems to be the National
Kuhmo poster child, praising them left and right. I havn't gotten around
to the point of making the $500 experiment, but I may by the end of the
year.
