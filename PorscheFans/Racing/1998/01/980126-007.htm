Fellow track junkies:

Driving 2 cars to the track (wife/2kids) is getting old not to mention
not having
easy access to my street tires when it rains so I decided to invest in a
trailer.
I purchased a Suburban with a 350 with HD towing pkg in November and am
now trailer shopping.  I'm seeking opinions on pros/cons for open vs.
enclosed
trailers.  I can get a new 15' open trailer (all steel, 4w elec brakes
etc) for $1500 but I will need to add a tire rack.  If I go this route,
I'd like to buy a MIG
welder and do it myself.  Total cost I figure ~$2000.

OTOH, I can spend a little more and get a 20'-24' used enclosed for
under $3000.   It may need new wheel bearings, brakes and maybe tires.
Since
my car is garaged most of the winter, I figure I can use it as a third
garage.

Will the Sub/350 be big enough (300 lb ft torque) to pull a 24'?
Is the enclosed a better buy in the long run?  It has enough room in it
for 
tires, workbench etc and already has 110V wired w. fluorescents etc so
running an air compressor etc is also possible.   Any other pros/cons?

I don't want to buy too small and outgrow it.   Also the car will be
protected
from the elements, rock chips etc in the enclosed.  I need some good
arguments to sell this to my <ahem> loan officer.

Thanks for any input,
