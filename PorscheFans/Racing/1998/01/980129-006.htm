It all depends on the sanctioning body that runs your DE events. Some clubs
only require a snell M rated helmet, dates are variable too. If it's current
GCR rules though, I believe you'll need a Snell SA95 rated helmet. Mail order
from companies like Pegasus, OG, or numerous others. SA rated helmets are
harder to come by than M rated helmets as there are far more motorcycle
riders out there than race car drivers.
