Folks,

This topic may be beaten to death already but I haven't read my mail for
a week.  I can't speak to the weight issue but I do have a comment on
the HP topic.

Another thing that the current rules book does not do is make clear what
"kind" of HP are being quoted.  Specifically, I'm referring to the fact
that on the 911SC, USA HP figures are SAE values, the ROW (euro) are DIN
values.  They are not the same; it's apples and oranges (OK, maybe red
apples and green apples).  This is particularly important since the
values are used to calculate power-to-weight values which are in turn
used as part of the classification process.  The 204 HP value for the
ROW SC is, I believe, approximately equal to 194 SAE.  I'm sure there is
an engineer out there (Kevin?) that can speak in more detail to this
topic.

Probably, the rule book should be updated to show HP ratings in SAE and
DIN.  At the very least the rule book should specify what measurement
system was used.

Subject: PCA Racing weight and power data

Can anybody tell me how PCA came up with the following weight & power
figures?
According to my data source (factory owner manuals and various 911
books)
these are not correct figures. Are these meant as general guidelines
only or
are they supposed to reflect reality?

78-83 911SC (USA)2552lbs  180 Hp
78-83 911SC (Euro)2552lbs  204 Hp
84-86 911 Carrera 2756 lbs   200 Hp
84-89 Carrera (Euro) 2756 lbs. 231 Hp
