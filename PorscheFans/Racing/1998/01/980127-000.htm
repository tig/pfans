The tire patch debate is a good one, and I believe Forrest and "R.L."
are correct.  Although it's sometimes difficult to visualize, tire width
has no affect on contact patch size.  This sounds counter-intuitive; but
it's true.  It's not the tire that's holding the car up.  It's the air
pressure.  Sidewall stiffness can have an affect (run flat tires are the
extreme); however, the debate was centered around different sized tires
of similar construction.

The calculation  "psi / load = contact patch" holds true no matter what
size tire you run.  If you want to change tire patch size, you need to
change pressure. 

Have fun,

<<< <<SNIP>>Saw the illustration, I tend to not agree. If we take all
factors to be
equal
 save that of tire size, the patch _will_ be larger. The illustration
implies
that
 the longitudinal dimension will shrink as the transverse dimension
grows as
tire
 size goes up. How would this happen? If tire pressure were
significantly
 increased so that the tire carcass deforms less from the weight of the
car,
or
 the diameter of the wheel/tire were decreased so that there was less
tire
 contacting the ground. But neither condition is permitted in our "all
factors
 being equal" argument.<<

 > <<SNIP>> I'm not sure my drawing transferred well to the list. It
must have to you.
You got the idea. The length and width of the patch does change with the
tire
sizes. Ponder a corner of a car that weighs 600lb and a tire on that
corner
with 30 psi(pounds per square in.) in it to hold up that corner. The
contact
patch is 20 square inches(600divided by 30). If you put 30psi in an
equal(same
construction, etc.) only wider tire to hold up the corner, the patch
will
still be 20 sq. in.. This may be bothersome to some because the "air
tank" of
the wider tire will be larger, just remember, we're talking psi.<  >>>
