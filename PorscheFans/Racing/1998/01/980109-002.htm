Thanks Steve. That was exactly the information I was looking for. I
wanted a failsafe temp that I could mark on the gauge and pull off the
track if the temp got up to there.

And I'm not _quite_ ready for a new motor.

Hi Guys, 
The Fabcar control arms are very nice and in the long run might be cost
effective. There is one very important caveat that people are overlooking,
that being that the ball joints themselves are completely exposed. There is no
rubber boot for water or grit protection. This means for an everyday driver
those joints are going to need constant maintenance. Like slathering them in
grease periodically. Obviously not a problem for a dedicated track care but
certainly a maintenance liability on a "driver."
The only time I've seen ball joint failures, and they are ugly when they
happen, has been with cars that have been lowered or cars that are depending
on increased diameter anti sway bars for front end stiffening. The worse combo
is a lowered car with a serious swaybar and stock springs. You really should
stiffen up the front with springing rather than depending on "Cup" swaybars.
Kelly Moss will tell you that if the springs are right and the swaybars are
balanced to that spring rate the ball joint may wear out but it won't fail.
They quote a very impressive number (I forget the number) of track hours with
nary a fractured ball joint.
FWIW
Regards, 
Jerry
