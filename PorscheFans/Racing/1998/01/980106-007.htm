<pre>
this is a repost from a couple of days ago...

I would like to add the earlier (pre 1970) 911 Coupes to my list of inquiry.
Sorry about the BW.

Subject: Re: Tires choices for novice racer

As the owner of a company that sells the BFG R1, the Yokohama A008RS & RSII,
Hoosiers and Kumos, I can tell you what my customers like and don't like. The
first choice for people who want to use the same tires for track and street
use are the A032's. I've driven the A008RS's on the street for years and was
very happy, wet or dry. The R1 is fine if you're willing to live with a
rougher ride.

By the way, R1's have a bad rap about wearing out quick. They will if not
managed properly. BFG has literature that is very specific about how to manage
their tires. Most setting are just the opposite of what most of us learned was
the "right" way to make adjutments.

For example, a customer had lowered his tire pressure looking for more
performance from his R1's. He neglected to watch them and failed to see the
"groove of doom" appearing where the two rubber compounds meet (about 1/3 of
the way in from the outside edge). If he had noticed he would have increased
tire pressure. Every other tire I know, if you're wearing out the center of
the tire you lower pressure. Reading BFG's literature is important.

I sell all the above tires for tire rack or better prices. The A008RS would
not be a bad choice. I would stay away from the RSII's. Although they have
more stick than the RS's, I've known people to use up an entire set in less
than a weekend. The tire isn't designed for road racing/time trialing. It's
strickly for Autocross. Using them on continuous lap tracks will overheat them
and they will evaporate in front of your face.

I hope this helps
