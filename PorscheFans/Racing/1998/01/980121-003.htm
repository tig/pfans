I have to agree with Kevin's opinion.  Back when IMSA first introduced
the concept of the WSC class, I was hoping to see a new NA flat 8 or 12,
but instead saw massaged 962's.  The same with the 911 GT1.  Porsche
seems to be stuck in a time warp.  The turbo era is, and has been, long
dead.  It died back when turbos were banned in F-1.

I sure would like to see, and hear, a 5 or 6 liter flat 12 in the 911
GT1;  and quit calling it a 911.

I'm rambling in the wrong arena, so I'll quit.

* does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?

I learned today that we are *not* going to see the GT1's there this
year - major bummer.  They're not competitive with the other cars in
GT1, and Porsche as usual will not support a series in which they
cannot clean house.  The Rohr car was there for practice, but will not
be there for the race.

There are also very few GT2 entries, so few that apparently they may be
bumped to GT1.

Personal opinion: I wish the Factory would get their collective heads
out of the sand.  These series don't want turbocharged cars, haven't
for years, and have only let Porsche in with their damned turbos,
handicapped, to fill the field and to take advantage of a famous marque
in terms of its draw.  It's a normally aspirated, water cooled,
multi-valved world outside of Zuffenhausen...
