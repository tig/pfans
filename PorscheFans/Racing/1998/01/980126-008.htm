Saw the illustration, I tend to not agree. If we take all factors to be equal
save that of tire size, the patch _will_ be larger. The illustration implies that
the longitudinal dimension will shrink as the transverse dimension grows as tire
size goes up. How would this happen? If tire pressure were significantly
increased so that the tire carcass deforms less from the weight of the car, or
the diameter of the wheel/tire were decreased so that there was less tire
contacting the ground. But neither condition is permitted in our "all factors
being equal" argument.

Yes, the wider the tire on a given wheel is not always going to be the best. It's
a point of diminishing returns. On a fixed wheel width, the tire will have to
pinch to fit on a narrow rim, and will tend to round the tread surface. And this
_cannot_ be ignored when considering tire/wheel sizes for competition purposes.
Wider tires on a given wheel will eventually approach a limit as to what size
contact patch can be created until the tire can not fit on the wheel.

Ideally, in competition, a tire should be mounted on as wide a wheel as it can be
stretched onto. But let's take an extreem real world example. My car, currently
running on 6" rims. I could mount anything from a 165 to a 225 width tire. Are
you going to argue that the contact patch for a 165 width tire is the same as a
225 width tire? Do I claim that a 225 squeezed onto a 6" rim is ideal? No.
Ideally, I would want to stretch the tire onto a 9" rim. But for now, a 225 on a
6" rim is as much as my stock fenders can accomodate. As the size of the tire
increases, the rim width should increase along with it.
