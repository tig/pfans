i've got some questions about supertrapps.  my new car came with an
outrageously loud dual-outlet sport muffler, and it's just too noisy for
street use.  it also came with a stock muffler, but the p.o. had the rear
valence cut-out welded up when the car was flared, so for the time being,
i'm stuck with the sport muffler.

luckily, amongst the spare parts i got with the car was a set of 3" disc
supertrapps, one for each outlet.  i think i know the story with
supertrapps, but i'd like to get the word from those in the know.  can
someone give me the basic primer on care and feeding of these exotic toys?

the motor is a 2.4 T with S p&c, E cams and webber 40IDAs, the muffler is
a stock muffler that's had the outlet plugged, and two pipes stuck out the
middle of the back.  from what i could tell poking around with a
flashlight, it's got nothing in it except a metal plate running lengthwise
down the middle 1/2 of the inside.

how many discs do i want to use?  i assume as many as i can get.  how many
would be too few?  i figure i'll take the supertrapps off when i autox it,
unless we've got a sound limit.

thanks
