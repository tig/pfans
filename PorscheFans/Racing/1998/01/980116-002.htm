Does any PCA racer have a list of the motels in the Sebring area?  I have
lost my list.  TIA.

PFans,

Hey, was that rodney, the Rodney Ramos?  One third of the wild and crazy trio
of drivers that flew through Colorado leaving sparks along the mountain
roads!!?

What do you mean if you can find the time?  You gotta do it again!!

I've heard we may go all the way to Phoenix this year.  I sure would like to
do some different tracks like Daytona.  Or maybe just to get to go back to
Road America (without the fog as in 1996).  Maybe just any tracks without
rain!?

I'm still planning to do it in the supercharged 964 C4 this time.  Our
partners from 1997 with the 500E have had enough for a while and are ready to
try other driving events.  My 1996 partner with the 190E 3.6 RT is ready with
new engine and 350+ hp.

Later,

Zane
