My take on PCA club racing is that we are supposed to be "gentlemen
racers". This means you don't put a fender or bumper into anybody at
anytime and you don't cheat. The former is pretty easy to police. The
latter is apparently up to us as gentlemen not to do.

This will be my first year and my car is bone stock so I don't expect to
be a contender in E Stock anyway. But from SCCA Solo II and Pro Solo
experience I can tell you that protest-initiated policing is bad news.
It works to some extent but it leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth,
and it is typically not done at all at the local level. 

IMHO, scrutineering is the only way to enforce rules, and that's
strictly up to the organizers. But the downside is that it is awfully
hard to rebuild your engine for the trip home after it has been torn
down. As long as there aren't contingencies and purses things shouldn't
get too far out of hand. However, I'd like to see some simpler tests
made occasionally just to keep people more honest. For example, it is
fairly easy to tell if someone has different gearing which doesn't
require any dismantling.

Guys,

Sorry for the intrusion, but I need to get a hold of Ron Mistak and all of the
numbers that I have for him are apparently out of date.  If someone has his
current phone number, please let me know.  TIA - Monte
