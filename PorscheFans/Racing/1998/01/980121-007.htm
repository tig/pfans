Hi Azim,

The OEM front swaybars on the post 85.5 944 line are all the same size.
Hence the difference between the late aluminum control arms and the
early ones is that the swaybar mounting point is farther from the
spindle. This puts more force on the middle of these arms (generally not
a good thing).

The Weltmeister bar was specifically designed for the post 85.5 cars. I
used one on my '84 944 with steel control arms (snapped 2 while
autocrossing) and later with aluminum control arms from a post 85.5 car.
The mounting to the aluminum arms is clearly superior. The attachment to
pre-85.5 cars entails drilling a hole in the steel control arm which
creates a stress riser and is typically the failure point when the
control arm does fail (at least it was for me).

The big issue with using a larger swaybar on any 944 is that it will
eventually break the control arm if you do not do something to
counteract it, such as going to stiffer springs, or reinforcing the
control arms, or going to Fabcars or another alternative that is
stronger.
