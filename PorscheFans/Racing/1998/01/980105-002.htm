Hello David,

> looking for 245/45/16 the rear and 225/50/16 for the front. I will be
> driving the car to events.  Although this will only  be 25 to 30 miles each
> way. I have to considering two types of tires, BFG R1 and Yokohama A032R.

Note that the NEW R1 (the G force) R1 comes with only 3/32" of tread
(as opposed to the old R1 that came with 6/32nds). If you used to
shave R1's, than that doesn't matter. However, if you used the tires
at full tread depth, note that the new R1's probably won't last as 
long as the old ones. 

If you can still find them, the Yokohama A008 RS or RS II (I think 
they still make the RS, but the RS II has been discontinued) would
be a great choice. It's fast on the track (almost as fast as an R1,
slower than Hoosier, or Goodyear GSCS), fairly comfortable on the 
street (MUCH more comfortable than R1's) and lasts relatively long.
I got around 10 track days on the RS II. 

The A032R would probably be OK too. I've heard that it's noisy on
the street, and not as sticky as the A008 RS. However, it is supposed
to last longer. 

Personally, I do not like the R1. BFG seems to have a problem with 
quality control. Sometimes a tire will last 8-10 days, sometimes
you'll get patches of cord showing after 1 or 2 days. I know a number
of people (me included) who bought brand new R1's, broke them in,
used them on the track, and had patches of cord showing after 2
track days. The response from BFG was basically 'tough on you.'
For that reason, I will no longer use BFG tires.

I have recently purchased a set of Kuhmo R type tires. I hope they
are the answer.
