SEBRING TAKES GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE

------------------------------------------------------------------------
14 January, 1998
BRASELTON, Ga., January 12, 1998 -- Sebring International Raceway 
announced today that it will host its traditional 12-hour race on March 
21-22, 1998. 
The Superflo 12 Hours at Sebring Presented by Chrysler Corporation will 
maintain its traditional format, but will be open to cars conforming to 
Federation Internationale De L'Automobile (FIA), Automobile Club De 
L'Ouest (ACO), as well as SPORTS CAR technical regulations. 
"We purchased Sebring International Raceway, and we are honoring the 
existing commitments of race sponsorship and television relationships 
for 1998," said Don Panoz, chairman of Panoz Motor Sports. "Professional 
Sports Car will continue to sanction the event." 
In order to maximize event participation and foster a more global 
perspective, the expansion of eligibility was initiated. 
"This change has allowed us to open the Sebring 12 Hours to a broader 
cross section of teams, drivers, and manufacturers," says Jim Selwa, COO 
of Panoz Motor Sports, "and host an invitational format that brings the 
best of every sports car racing series to our facility." 
The race weekend will feature the Sebring 12 Hours on Saturday, March 
21, an HSR Vintage Race on Sunday, SPEEDVISION Cup on Friday, as well as 
other support races.
