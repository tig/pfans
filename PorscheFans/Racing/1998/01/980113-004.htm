OK, it's time to see what the P-car will really do!

I've seen an indicated 140 mph on the speedo near the end of the straight 
at Laguna Seca, and have been radar'd at 118 mph near the end of the 
straight at Thunderhill, but the 993 is factory rated for 171 and none of 
the tracks in Northern CA has a long enough straight, so...

I've been toying with the idea of entering the Silver State Classic, the 
Silver State Challenge, or one of the other Nevada road races, where one 
can run on closed public highways.  The article about the street/race 928 
in a recent Excellence/Pano issue has inspired me to investigate this venue 
further.

Does anyone have information on entering any of these races?  At this point 
I'm still investigating and haven't made up my mind, so any personal 
experience at these races that you can share to recommend for or against 
them would also be appreciated.

Thanks,
Bob

P.S.  I normally work on better lines and cornering techniques, so the 6 to 
12 track events I do a year leave me contented, but just once I'd like to 
go for pure straight line top speed.
