Kevin,

Soon you will see "normally aspirated, water cooled, multi-valved" cars
from Porsche in the GT3 class. They are based on the 996. The GT1 is
a "water cooled, multi-valved" car that is turbocharged.

It's a shame that the sanctioning bodies are biased against turbos. It is
a valuable technology that should be tested in racing so we can have more
efficient street cars (that just happen to perform better!).

Relying on cubic inches for horsepower is not forward thinking.
