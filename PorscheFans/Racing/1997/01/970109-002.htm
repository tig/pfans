Okay P-fans,

Well, I've been wavering for a year now about purchasing a SS muffler for
my 3.2 911.  I'm  pretty much sold on the Monty (4" single outlet) I would
make B&B my second choice.  I have heard they have resonance problems, and
have just been sent a package from them, only to find out that their
muffler which used to cost $875 is not over $1000! ... The Monty I am
looking at is $950.

I know you can only gain mere HP numbers some where around 5% might be to
liberal I feel, but I like the over sized tip, want to make the car sound
more aggressive and get a little more power (not asking for to much here). 


I know Bruce will be shaking his head here since he provided me with very
detailed information previously (thanks Bruce) just a reluctant expense so
I want to make sure that I really want it, and want to find out what others
have done.

Any input or commentary would be appreciated.

Joe
