As a follow up to Mr. Smith's comments about club racing news.  First, some
of the logistics.  The News is specifically limited to 6 pages an issue for
postage reasons.  The money from PCNA does cover most of the costs of the
newslette but with 1,300 licenseholders those continue to go up.  with 6
issues a year and only 6 pages the amount of info is somewhat limited that
can be included.  More importantly, the info from the regions is most often
very limited with no real news stories and sometimes not even any results.
The News also functions as a newsletter about rules changes, proposed and
actual.  That obviously takes up a fair amount of space.  Finally, also to
keep down costs, there are no pictures published.
Now, you'll remember if you've been around club racing for more then a
season, that the News was previously a catch as catch can publication with
severely limited info.  It is now being published on a regular basis with a
significant improvement in the quality, quantity, etc.  I expect that will
continue to improve over the next year, but guys, give the editor a break.
He's got a real job just like the rest of us and only has so much time for
his hobby (plus he'd really like to drive occasionally)
That's not to say that he wouldn't welcome some short, breezy, informative
articles about a specific race, race group, cornerworker's outfit, etc.
However, the first info that must be published is the rules changes,
followed by info on our sponsors, race results and then articles (did you
see the only recently about paddock etiquette? )  I'd say give him a chance
and it'll get better.
Now, I'd also suggest that if you want to see it get bigger, that you thank
PCNA and also the other national sponsors for their support of the program.
There is a direct connection between their perception of whether their bucks
are having any impact and the amount that the program receives.  If PCNA
thinks that they are having some impact, either thru your writing them,
telling your dealer, or whatever, they are much more apt to increase the
bucks and maybe the News can go to 8 issues (proposed but not in the budget
this year) or some other physical improvement.
