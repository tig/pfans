Jerry, Jerry.......sorry if I insulted you somehow.  Wasn't saying gee you're 
stupid to buy a 914 for club racing, only that IMHO you can do the same thing 
for less money with a 944..... 
 
Some points: 
 
<I can go out this afternoon and buy a 914/6 conversion with a 
	professionally built 2.7 S engine with complete 	 
	brake/suspension upgrades for 10K. That's much faster than 
	a NA 944. 
 
Yup, you probably can.  In Club racing classes that'd be a GT4 car I believe.  
If you can buy a car prepped well enough to be "competitive" in GT4 I suggest 
you mortgage the farm if you have to and go get it.  I doubt though that this 
car would be competitive at that price. 
 
<Well, I'm glad that you've done so well! I see you placed 1st 
	in your class in 3 races, 2nd in another, and no DNS or DNF's. 
	Since I've never even done an autocross I doubt I could do as 
	well. My post was directed at the _entry_level_ Club Racer 
	(specifically, Barry Lenoble and myself) so I don't think 
	your results have much bearing on what we could realistically 
	expect to do. 
 
I've never done an autocross either.  The 944 is very well balanced and I've 
seen 5 or 6 first timers out last year who're gonna be giving me fits this 
year....an I'll probably be helping them set up their suspensions and lending 
'em tools. That's the spirit of club racing.  And you might be surprised at 
how well you can do.  Barry, by the way has track experience. 
 
< Replacing the rod bearings 
	is waaaaay more expensive on a 944. 
 
Let's see, the rod bearings were $90 and it took 3-4 hours.  I don't think you 
could do rod bearings on a 914 within the same cost/time constraints.  It'd 
take that long to get the motor out and stripped to even get to the bearings 
wouldn't it? 
 
 <Also, you failed to address one 
	of my main reasons for using a 914: it's upgradable. When I've 
	done all I can in the 1.7 or 1.8 liter, I'll move up to the 2.0 
	liter. When I've done all I can there, I'll go to a 914/6. With 
	a 944, you have only two options that make any kind of fiscal 
	sense (to me anyway); turbo and non-turbo. 
 
Any car is upgradable.  One could add HP to a 944 by dropping 800 pounds with 
a cutting tool, add some fiberglass and voila, a GT4 car. 
 
<And here's the kicker; 17K may not be a lot of money to *you*, 
	but 17K is a *hell* of a lot of money to me espcially when it's 
	potentially just a pile of scrap because it was way more powerful 
	than I could handle in real racing conditions. It just makes 
	more sense to me to spend only 4K on a (disposable) 1.7 914. That 
	way, you're out so much less if the worst happens. 
 
The point wasn't whether 17K is a lot of money to me or not.  The point was 
that a race prepped 944Turbo at 17K runs in the same class and runs door to 
door with cars costing lots more money. (60K 993) I'm trying to point out 
relative value.  My SO started time trialing last year and I stuck her in the 
944.  Never been on a track before.  It's a great starter car, very forgiving, 
etc. 
 
Anyway, sorry if I've provided an experience that didn't shift your paradigm 
but instead challenged you beliefs.  The important thing is that you go buy 
something and have a little fun........ 
 
Ted

	I can go out this afternoon and buy a 914/6 conversion with a
	professionally built 2.7 S engine with complete 	
	brake/suspension upgrades for 10K. That's much faster than
	a NA 944.

	Well, I'm glad that you've done so well! I see you placed 1st
	in your class in 3 races, 2nd in another, and no DNS or DNF's.

	The first three are more expensive on a 944 than a 914. In fact,
	you don't even do number 3 on a 914. Replacing the rod bearings
	is waaaaay more expensive on a 944.

	I don't know about Barry, but I would be in tears if I banged
	up a fender on my 944.

	I don't think Barry and I are really looking to replace
	the motors in our cars with a good used motor that came from
	god knows where (no offense). Also, you failed to address one
	of my main reasons for using a 914: it's upgradable. When I've
	done all I can in the 1.7 or 1.8 liter, I'll move up to the 2.0
	liter. When I've done all I can there, I'll go to a 914/6. With
	a 944, you have only two options that make any kind of fiscal
	sense (to me anyway); turbo and non-turbo.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	A 914/6 can be much, much faster than a NA 944.
