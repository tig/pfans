I don't know about the revolution wheels, as I was lucky enough to get
a set of real R offset Fuchs when I bought my car.  I bought a set of
the new yokes, but I was not to impressed with them.  I have spoken to
a guy that loved them on his race prepared 944, and they seemed to
work OK on my friends 914, but he still learning to drive, so he did
not push them very hard.  The experience I had was they were OK for a
few laps, then they started to go away.  After the event and talking
to a couple of people, I am going to try running with lower pressure
my next trip to the track.  I was running 28f 31r, My co-owner is
taking the car to Sebring next weekend (1/18), and I gave him some
pressures to try.  My theory is that these need less pressure, like
the R1's.  I am going to try 25f/27r and see how that works.

Anybody else have any experience with these tire on a 911
specifically.  If I can't make these work I am going to switch to the
BFG R1's.
