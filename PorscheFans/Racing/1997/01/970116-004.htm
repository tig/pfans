I disagree that a 914 is a cheaper car to track and race than a 944.  You can 
buy an 83-84 944 for 1500 with bent valves.  You can buy a 944 in running 
condition for 3K.  I bought my 944 ready to go for $7500.  It had a 45K 84 
motor, 88 87 posi trans and was completely set up for Club Racing with bigger 
springs, Konis, bigger torsion bar, sway bars, etc.  I added camber plates, 
adj. struts, and a few other goodies but the car was ready to go as purchased. 
 
I placed 1st in class in 3 Club Races last year and 2nd in another.  I ran 10 
events between races and TTrials. No DNS or DNFs.  Maintenance was limited to 
wheel bearings all around, oil changes, belt adjustment every 3 events and I 
used up a set of brake pads.  I also dropped the pan and replaced the rod 
bearings.  The ones that came out were like new but I wouldn't have known that 
had I not looked. 
 
I banged up a fender in Portland.  Good used fender was $150.  I think Porsche 
made more 944 cars than any other model. This means lots of used parts are 
available. 
 
Now, the prime caveat.  If I need a new motor, one call to the Porsche 
dismantler and $1100-$1400 and a good used low mileage motor is on the way.  
Belts, rod bearings and you're on your way. 
 
And they're faster and a lot more fun to drive(IMHO)  than a 914. 
 
 
Think this one over and you'll be looking for a used 944.......

Hey All,

I find myself in a similar quandry. After attending my first Club Race
this year (Hallet), I'm dying to do it. Realisticaly, I am years away from
acquiring the skills neccessary for wheel to wheel racing but I have
started to give it some serious thought. Like Barry, I would be pretty
devastated (emotionally and financially) if I cracked up my precious 944.
What I've decided to do and my suggestion to others who are unable to risk
a 944/911 in the Club Racing scene for whatever reason is to race some
version of a 914. This is especially good for me for several reasons. I'm
getting a late start in life on learning track-type driving skills. I
think a 944/951/911 would be too overpowering for me in a race. With a
914, I can start with a 1.7 liter engine if I want thus minimizing the
risk to myself and others. As I get better, I can work my way up the
ladder to a 914/6 conversion. Buying or preparing a 914 for Club Racing is
much cheaper than doing the same with a 944. You have less of an
investment if you crash and replacements are readily available should the
worst occur. For instance, in this week's Auto Trader in Dallas, there's
an ad for a 914/6 conversion (with a professionally built 2.7S engine)
with complete suspension and brake upgrades for only 10K. It's ready to
go. 1.7 liter 914's often go for 3-4K in Dallas (good ones, too).
On the other hand, 10K might get you a reliable 951 that you could spend
another 10K on before it was ready to race. So, all in all, this is an
excellent way to go for me. If you're considering Club Racing but worried
about or unable to afford a major accident, give this route some thought.
Comments?
