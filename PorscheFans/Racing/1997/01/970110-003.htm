I think, maybe, "bigtime" racing and "amateur" is an oxymoron. The last
"amateur" I saw do well in "bigtime" racing was when John Cannon won a
CanAm race at Laguna Seca in a clapped-out McLaren partly because he cut
slits in his goggles and partly because he was a better rain-driver. The
antics of his rag-tag team in victory circle was heartwarming.

IMSA big time? Don't think so unless they get the FIA (ex-BPR) cars into
GT1 in way that will allow them to be competitive in the long-distance
races against the WSC cars.
