	Hear! Hear! As a complete racing newbie, I have no idea
	how to interpret times, classes, etc. You go to a race, 
	track event, or autocross and all you see are some times
	posted. If you know nothing about racing, they might as well
	be in Sumerian. We need a newsletter, pamphlet, booklet that
	gives a good intro to racing for newbies like me. Otherwise,
	I bound to take up all your time seemingly pointless
	questions :)
