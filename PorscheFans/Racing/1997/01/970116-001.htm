Hey All,

I find myself in a similar quandry. After attending my first Club Race
this year (Hallet), I'm dying to do it. Realisticaly, I am years away from
acquiring the skills neccessary for wheel to wheel racing but I have
started to give it some serious thought. Like Barry, I would be pretty
devastated (emotionally and financially) if I cracked up my precious 944.
What I've decided to do and my suggestion to others who are unable to risk
a 944/911 in the Club Racing scene for whatever reason is to race some
version of a 914. This is especially good for me for several reasons. I'm
getting a late start in life on learning track-type driving skills. I
think a 944/951/911 would be too overpowering for me in a race. With a
914, I can start with a 1.7 liter engine if I want thus minimizing the
risk to myself and others. As I get better, I can work my way up the
ladder to a 914/6 conversion. Buying or preparing a 914 for Club Racing is
much cheaper than doing the same with a 944. You have less of an
investment if you crash and replacements are readily available should the
worst occur. For instance, in this week's Auto Trader in Dallas, there's
an ad for a 914/6 conversion (with a professionally built 2.7S engine)
with complete suspension and brake upgrades for only 10K. It's ready to
go. 1.7 liter 914's often go for 3-4K in Dallas (good ones, too).
On the other hand, 10K might get you a reliable 951 that you could spend
another 10K on before it was ready to race. So, all in all, this is an
excellent way to go for me. If you're considering Club Racing but worried
about or unable to afford a major accident, give this route some thought.
