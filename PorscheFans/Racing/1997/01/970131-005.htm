I am searchhing for my dream car, a wide bodied 911 Turbo and think that
I would probably like to get a 78 or 79 930.  They have some of the
features that I demand, good performance and acceptable reliability. I am
not having much luck tracking one down here in my area.
(south-west/central) I have however located a vehicle nearby and am
curious.  It is one of the 83 Euro 930's/  What are the striking
differences.  Is it less valuable or desirable?  Is the performance and
reliability better, worse or the same?  If anyone could e-mial me
directly with some info, I would greatly appreciate it.  As this is to be
the realiztion of my childhood fantasy, I do not want it to become a 
nightmare.

Thanks
Bryan Carlson
