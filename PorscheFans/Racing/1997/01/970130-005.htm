A mid July event in Colo. Spngs would work for me.  On the left coast, our PCA 
Club racing doesn't start until August with the Portland event so I would 
accomodate a July date and would bet that I could talk the guys at Bauer 
Porsche to load their 6 car hauler with Bay area cars and haul 'em out.

G'day,

I've been asked by the Rocky Mountain Region PCA to poll the Club Racers on
this list regarding having a Club Race in conjunction with the 1998 Parade in
Steamboat Springs, CO.  
The regions board is contemplating this as we speak, but are reluctant to
commit to the expense and logistic problems without an idea of the potential
turnout.
To that end, I would like to ask the Club Racers, both current and
prospective, if this is something they would be interested in enough to
attend.
The course at Steamboat is at the Mt. Werner ski area and is a "street
course".  This has both pluses and minuses.  The pluses being an interesting
and challenging 1.7 mile course set in the scenic splendor of the Colorado
mountains. It has a lot of elevation change, excellent viewing areas and you
can walk to the course from your condo. The course was first established by
Rocky Mountain Vintage Racing in 1985 and their annual Labor Day Weekend
event has become a "must do" on the lists of vintage racers from all over the
country.
If there are any minuses, it would be that as a "street" course, it leaves
little margin for error and the fact that PCA National would be limiting the
entry to 120 cars.
This event would replace the traditional RMR June Club Race and would be held
in the middle of July.  (I don't have the exact Parade dates in front of me)
Please e-mail responses to me (pm9146@aol.com).  I am interested in both
positive and negative responses with reasons and comments.  This issue will
be discussed in depth at RMR's March board meeting so soonest is bestest.

TIA

Pat Moyle (pm9146@aol.com)

As an aside, Alan Friedman towed from VA this past Labor Day to run the RMVR
race and also evaluate the course from a Club Racing standpoint.  He had a
ball and gave the course his approval.  It is now up to region to decide if
they can handle it.  Your help will be greatly apreciated.  Also please ask
your Club Racing friends who may be "cyberphobic" and not receive this
request.
