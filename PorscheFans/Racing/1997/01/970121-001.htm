Hi guys,

Boy, I go on a short vacation, and I miss the entire thread!

I really enjoyed reading all the posts. As usual, lots of very
good stories, and plenty of factual, first person information.

FYI (if you care):

I AM going to club race my car. I have the signed letter from 
my chief instructor, the application is completed, and my
physical is scheduled for tomorrow.

My roll bar should be here any day, my driving suit has been
ordered. All that's left is to add the window net and kill switch,
and to fill out the race app for the Lime Rock race (4/25-26).

I have prepared myself for the (hopefully slim) chance that
my car might be destroyed.

I don't expect to win, or even be competitive in my class. I'm
just looking for something more than a driver ed event. With
that in mind, and being a rookie and all, I'm going to drive
very conservatively. If someone faster is behind me, I'm going
to stay on my line and let them go by (at least for the first
few laps until the adrenaline gets going and ...). Seriously,
I'm going to be very careful out there.

A better solution to racing my car (89 944 TS) would be to get
and race a NA 944, but I am not ready to part with my car.
Unfortunately, I've become emotionally attached to it. Perhaps
in a year or two, when I have a better budget in place, I can
also get a NA 944 racer.

As to the 914 thread, no offense, but I just don't like them.
So it's 944's for me.

See you at the finish line,

Barry Lenoble
