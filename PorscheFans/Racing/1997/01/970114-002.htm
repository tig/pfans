Hi All:

I am preparing an 81 911SC to run in the G stock class in the PCA  Club races
and I need some information.

1.  At present I have SSI heat exchanger exhausts that connect to a dual
inlet/single outlet 1974 muffler on the car.  When it was originally
installed, I could feel a substanial change in the cars perfromance.
 Recently, I visited a PCA Club race and looked over other cars in my future
class.  I noticed that each car was using headers and megafones as their
exhaust system.  My questions are:  Do I need to change to headers to be
competetive and will I really notice a difference from my currnet system?
 Also, would the headers fit my 74 muffler?

2.  At present I have 9x16 Fuchs on the rear of the car with 245/45/16 tires.
 For the G stock class I will only be able to run 8 x16 wheels.  Can I still
use the 245/45/16 tires or will I need to use some other size to meet the 3%
rolling radius rule?  Does anyone have a chart relating to wheel size, tires
size and rolling radius?  Stock rear wheels and tires on my car are 225/50/16
on 7x16 wheels.

Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks in advance.
