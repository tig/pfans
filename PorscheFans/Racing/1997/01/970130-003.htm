There are numerous sets of rules in the PCA. For example
I will use my area as a reference. Connecticut Valley region
has their own sets of rules, which are different for track and
autocross. Track (driver's ed) is only safety rules, there are no
"classes" for modifications. Autocross rules are now close to
the national Parade competition Rules  (PCRs).
But we mostly class by driving experience and number of cylinders.
Then moving up to the Zone level, Zone 1 has rules for the
Zone 1 autocross which could be the same as the PCRs but
I'm not sure. Then when you get to the parade the PCRs are
followed. 

But I don't know if you can get a copy of the PCRs before the
parade to prepare your car, they should be available at the beginning
of the year as the SCCA rulebook is. Changes to the PCRs
are published in PANORAMA but are only useful
if you attended the last parade.

One other set of rules is the PCA club racing rules which 
you can get a copy of by calling the PCA HQ.

In PCA club racing it would be one stock class faster than the SC.
(with the 3.2 and 3.6 Carreras where it should be very competitive).
In the PCRs you are bumped to modified class
immediately. But if you put a US spec engine in it
you can run in the stock class (that's the main difference
in your case).

>  Are there rules somewhere online?

That would be a great idea!!!!!!
