Aldo-

The "S2" designation refers to an option that was offered on 1992 911
Turbos in the United States. That year Porsche raced (through the Brumos
dealership) a 911 Turbo in the IMSA Supercar Series, and the 911 Turbos
S2s were a homologation effort. The S2 package includes a large
Garretson intercooler (larger than the one found on the 1994 911 Turbo
3.6L), a unique hybrid K-27 turbo, and 964 cams. Twenty-five cars were
prepared in this manner by Andial. Porsche claimed the horsepower on
these cars was 322bhp (compared to 315 for stock), and the torque was
354 nm. However, independent testing by Sports Car International and
others showed horsepower figures in the 350-400 range.

I have several articles on the S2 cars if you are interested.
