Thanks for you informed response.  Two points:  
 
1. Do you or anyone on the list know of an email address for someone at PCNA 
who would be an influential person to express our appreciation for their 
support? 
 
2. Since it looks like it may be a while before we get funding/approval to up 
the content of the newsletter, perhaps we can do something now to accumulate 
and distribute info amongst ourselves within this medium.  I'll be attending 4 
Club races this year, Las Vegas, Willow Springs, Portland and Sears Point.  I 
usually write something up for our newsletter and post to the list and I'd be 
willing to put more info together, such as the printouts of competitors and 
results we get at the track and incident info, dsq's etc. 
 
I find that I pass along info from Porschefans in hard copy form to my 
technologically deprived Porsche friends so this may be away to get info 
disseminated cheaply and bring more (human) bandwidth into the equation. Hey, 
isn't that what this internet stuff is really about, enriching our lives and 
improving the human condition. 
 
Anyone else out there going to any races where they'd could commit to 
collecting and distributing from events shortly after they happen?  Just think 
about what a great service to humanity that would be.....at least humanity of 
the pcar racer genre........:) 
 
Putting the soapbox away now....
