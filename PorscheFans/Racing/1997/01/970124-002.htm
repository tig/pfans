Stapleton is a 3.0 mile airport circuit with 10 turns and surprisingly, some
elevation change.  Fast cars will get down in the 2:00 minute per lap range.
 I think Martin 
Snow qualified at a 1:53 and something last year, but I don't have that info
in front of me.  He was also turning in the 185 mph range at the end of the
long, downhill straight.  There are rumors afloat that the track may be
shortened a bit this year, but that remains to be seen.

As far as amenities are concerned, they consist of what you can bring or
borrow.  Being a temporary circuit in nature, there are no permanent
facilities like water, fuel air etc. Last year we had the BFG truck for tire
mounting and air, we also had a local vendor there to supply race fuel for
those that needed it There will be a lunch wagon if it's like last year.
 Stapleton is the old Denver Airport and is located almost in the middle of
town so you are not far from food, lodging etc.  I can't be more specific
about what will be available this year as the event is still in the planning
stages.
