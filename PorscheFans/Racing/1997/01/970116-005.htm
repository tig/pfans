I suspect that from one perspective this is true.  More and more money is 
coming into Club racing and the level of car preparation, driver skill and 
competition is increasing. I think this makes the state of Club racing better, 
however not worse. 
 
 It is now the second largest amateur racing organization in the U.S.  Why?  I 
think because anyone can get out there and have a great time for relatively 
little money.  Also, where else can you competitively run your Porsche.  In 
SCCA, our ever shrinking "big brother", you will you have a better chance of 
building a competitive IT class Datsun 510 than any Porsche.  Somethings wrong 
with that picture but SCCA has never been "Porsche-friendly". 
 
I just made a post to this list about the relative low cost of building and 
running a 944.  I run in I stock.  I really didn't see a lot of competition in 
the races I ran last year but towards the end of the year, more cars were in 
my class and they were getting better.  Last year was my first full year of 
Club racing and yes I have the advantage of having had some prior racing 
experience (long ago and on a planet far away,A and B production, SCCA). If 
you wanted to run the same car with SCCA it would cost 3-4 times my investment 
to begin to be competitive in ITS. 
 
I'm looking for next years car and am trying to figure out what to build for a 
GT class.  GT1,2 and 3 are probably out since the $ necessary to build a 
competitive car now in those classes are outside of my budget.  There are some 
good options in GT4 and 5 however.   
 
 I also posted a lead on a nice  88 944TurboS that could've been bought for 
11.5K.  Add 4-5K for race mods and you've got a competitive car that runs with 
new 993s in E stock. Not a lot of money for big performance. 
  
The higher skill levels that (hopefully) come with more expensive cars will 
help improve everyones skills over the long term.  Except for time trial and 
autocross instruction, there is no race training that I'm aware of.  Maybe 
this is a next step as wheel to wheel is a different ball of wax. 
 
And yes, if you put your car on a track in a race, you have to be prepared to 
take it home in a bundle.  Most of the incidents I've seen have been solo 
efforts.  It wasn't wild driving by others that caused the incident.  I'd like 
to see some stats on this.  In general, the skill level of those I ran against 
was good and people were more careful than careless. There were one or two 
cars I ran with and wondered who the hell signed them off.  Mostly they looked 
oblivious rather than careless but the potential end result is unfortunately 
the same. 
 
So I think the state of Club Racing is getting better rather than worse and 
agree with Jerry about getting an inexpensive car and having a hell of a time. 
 I can't imagine that the guys with 5 times the investment in their cars are 
having any more fun than I am.  If they're not having as much fun, stick 
around.  You'll be able to buy their cars for 30 cents on the dollar when they 
decide to sell.
