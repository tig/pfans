	I can go out this afternoon and buy a 914/6 conversion with a
	professionally built 2.7 S engine with complete 	
	brake/suspension upgrades for 10K. That's much faster than
	a NA 944.

	Well, I'm glad that you've done so well! I see you placed 1st
	in your class in 3 races, 2nd in another, and no DNS or DNF's.
	Since I've never even done an autocross I doubt I could do as
	well. My post was directed at the _entry_level_ Club Racer
	(specifically, Barry Lenoble and myself) so I don't think
	your results have much bearing on what we could realistically
	expect to do.

	The first three are more expensive on a 944 than a 914. In fact,
	you don't even do number 3 on a 914. Replacing the rod bearings
	is waaaaay more expensive on a 944.

	I don't know about Barry, but I would be in tears if I banged
	up a fender on my 944.

	I don't think Barry and I are really looking to replace
	the motors in our cars with a good used motor that came from
	god knows where (no offense). Also, you failed to address one
	of my main reasons for using a 914: it's upgradable. When I've
	done all I can in the 1.7 or 1.8 liter, I'll move up to the 2.0
	liter. When I've done all I can there, I'll go to a 914/6. With
	a 944, you have only two options that make any kind of fiscal
	sense (to me anyway); turbo and non-turbo.

	A 914/6 can be much, much faster than a NA 944.
