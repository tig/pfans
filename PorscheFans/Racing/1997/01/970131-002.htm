>>
I'll be working on my suspension this weekend, including corner 
balancing.  I've lined up a set of scales, but I don't have a clear idea 
of how to corner balance.  Can anyone give me a basic tutorial?

I'm confused about how to adjust the weight without also screwing up the 
ride height.  Won't I end up with a car higher on one side than the 
other?  Or are the adjustments for weight balancing small in relation to 
ride height? <<

First you must set the ride height to where you want it.
Then the car will probably need corner balancing, as there is
no way to know if two diagonally opposite ends are supporting
most of the weight.

From old posts of mine :

Now the car must be balanced. On most cars without chassis
problems or bent sway bars, there is a simple method of getting the 
car set to baseline levelness. Simply disconnect one end (or the 2
center mounts if easier) of the sway bars and place something in
the driver's seat to approximate the driver's weight. Then try to
re-attach the sway bars and you will see if one side is higher
than the other because the mounts will not line up. Adjust the
sides until the bars line up and you have a basically level car
with no swaybar pre-load. But it is possible to have more weight
on two opposite corners of the car with this method. Try jacking up
one end of the car at the center-line and see if the car comes up
straight and both wheels leave the ground at the same time. If so, you
are probably OK. If not, or if you are a serious competitor, you
should corner-balance the car. The purpose is not to get the left and
right weights equal, but the proportions equal. The left side of
the car almost always weighs more than the right. Fred Puhn's book
"how to make your car handle" has a good explanation of this
procedure, or take your car to a good shop that understands the
concept. For example, if your right side weighs 1200 and the left 
1300, with a 40/60 weight distribution front to rear (mid '70s 911)
then the right-front should weigh .40 x 1200 (480) and the left
front .4 x 1300 (520).

The Puhn book (How to make your car handle) says "the left and right sides of
the car may not have equal weights, because the CG may be offset to the side.
It is only the front-to-rear RATIOS that should be identical" (copyright Fred
Puhn) To quote Puhn
again "if the front end of the car carries 40% of the total car weight, then
the left front
tire should carry 40% of the LEFT-SIDE weight." (Sorry Fred, please don't sue
me).
Bruce's book (old one, page 174, top right) says exactly the same thing.

When you find which diagonally opposite corners have too much weight
(they will each be high by the same amount if you calculated right!)
you should lower the 2 heavy corners, and raise the two light corners
slightly, all by the same amount, then drive the car and measure again.

what you will have at the track. >>

If you set the car level first, and always adjust all 4 diagonally opposite
corners to correct corner weights, the car should stay level.
