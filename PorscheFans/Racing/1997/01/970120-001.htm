	What would a GT4 944 cost me by comparison?

	I guess I was vague again. What I meant was that I haven't done
	anything at all. No track, no autocross, no Club Racing, no go
	kart racing, no skateboarding, etc.

	The rod bearings may be $90. I can't do the rod bearings on a 944
	or a 914. My shop charges $62/hr. labor so this makes it a very
	expensive proposition for me. The rod bearings (#2) are much
	more likely to go a 944 than a 914.

	Of course any car is upgradable. The question is price. The 914
	is cheaper to upgrade than the 944 is my point.

	No, that's exactly my point. 17K is too much money and sweat and
	tears for me to invest in a car that can get destroyed. I can buy
	4 914's for that price and be safer and still have fun and learn.
	Believe me, guys, the *last* thing you want to see at your next
	Club Race is me behind (or in front) of you in a 951!
