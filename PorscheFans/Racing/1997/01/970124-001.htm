A wire story moved about 9 p.m. Thursday night saying that Jones had awakened
and spoke to his wife.
Had feeling in his side.
In fact, they think he'll be released from the hospital on Monday. Saying it
was whiplash rather than head injury, helmet wasn't bruised.
I'd attached the newstory, as usual, except that -- now that I have a real
computer at work where I can just whip it over to a disk -- I didn't have any
disks with me. They're all at home. With my umbrellas.
Sigh. Sorrry.
