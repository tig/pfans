<< My problem with the rules is that stock should be stock. It shuts out

 >>stock car.
 
 >  I don't buy into this completely because even if you do have all that
 suspension stuff (we dont), you still have to drive the car.  Example: last
 month at Sears a fella named Scott Peeler won driving a basicly stock C2 on
 tires borrowed from another competitor! Although now that I think of it, I
 think he had too big of rims on that car. That is a good question because he
 borrowed Darryl Troesters 17" wheels off a turbo S, would those be 9" & 10"
 or the required 8" & 9" for the C2? But he even had a stock seat in it!!
 Ever try to hold yourself in a C2 on the track going as hard as you can with
 a stock slippery non-sport seat? It aint fun. With no seat and no wing he
 beat Ed Mineau (brown motored awsome euro sc), Bill Lusk in an RSA with an
 RSR wing runnin at C2 weight (which is bullshit in my not so humble opinion)
 on his home track. He also beat Tony Morelli (home track i think) and
 another couple guys in 944 turbos that Larz Geirsing prepares and this is
 most definitely thier home track.  How did he do it? I gotta vote pure
 talent! Unless he was using cheater wheels ;-) but still out drove everyone
 in the class.

 Dear Bob, Ted and Lance (group reply here) 
Hey there are always exceptions to the rule. Once in a while you've got to
swallow your ego (large gulp) and admit that you're not the next coming of
Sena. Some guys are really good no matter what they drive. Quite a few years
back I had a student, his name was David Donahue. He was genetically endowed
as we all have heard of his father and his exploits in Porsche history. David
was a quick study to say the least. He was going as fast as the instructor
group in about two weekends. he drove a clapped out SC which I could run away
from on the straights but in every corner David was on my butt with a big
grin on his face. If you follow racing you are always hearing his name and he
still has that great grin. A really nice guy and a good friend.
The point being that David is the exception to the rule. Most of us are in
the vast middle ground which if you stop to think about it is something to be
proud of. Racing is a blast and I feel very lucky to be participating in a
sport that most people only dream of. 
I fully agree that there is nothing wrong with refining the breed or having
the level of competition raised each year. My problem is that, and I am
speaking of the East Coast, that the grassroots guys are getting squeezed out
by professionally prepped teams and cars.
I remember participating in the second ever Club Race which took place at
Summit Point. There were 15 cars in my race group and four in my class. Now
race groups are typically 30 to 50 cars and it is not unusual to have 15 or
20 cars in E stock alone. We were all new to the series then and excitement
ran extremely high. After the racing was done there were hugs and atta boys
galore. Didn't matter where you finished, as long as you found someone to
race with. Now it's gotten real serious and I personally feel that allot of
the fun is gone and race weekends have been stressful. We even have paddock
fights which is just silly and way different than the original intent.
If it hasn't happened on the Left Coast consider yourself very lucky.
I don't think, in the stock classes, that money spent should be as large a
factor as it is becoming. I have no problem in the modified classes. That's a
choice you make and most people know what they are getting in to. I would
love stock to be really stock, even down to tires, just like a spec series.
It works well in plenty of venues. If you have the need to modify your car
then you have the choice of moving into the modified or prepared classes. I
know this isn't going to happen but it sure would make racing more accessible
to a greater number of participants, don't you think?
BTW Lance made a point that he has seen more balled up cars in track events
then at race events and I wholeheartedly agree. Keep in mind, however, that
your car is usually insured at a track event. Not so at a race event. A not
so small difference<g> that has to be reconciled before you commit your baby
to the Race series. Hey Lance do you race on the east coast? I think I
recognize your name from the E stock ranks.
I want to thank everyone who is participating in this thread. I hope it's
useful to the rest of the group who have decisions to make for this season.
Right now it is 6 degrees with a wind chill of -20 in Philadelphia so bench
racing is the order of the day. 
Cheers!
Jerry
