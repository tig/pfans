Guys - 

Help!  Has anyone found a web page that is giving information on Daytona?  I
watched the ESPN2 coverage today and it was okay except that they forgot to
tell us anything about qualifying except for the first two places in each
class.  I know that Martin qualified second in GTS-2 and that one of
Raimist's cars (probably the one with Doolin, Wagner, et al) placed sixth in
GTS-3 and that the Accura blew away everyone in that class, but would really
like to know all of the entrants and who qualified where.  We checked out
IMSA and ESPN, but nothing there.  Anyone got a lead?

Oh - also saw both of the Champion Porsches fall to mechanicals and
over-driving - Stuck, if you can believe that!  They've still got tomorrow,
however.  

TIA. - Monte
