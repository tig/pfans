	Nick, 
	
	The only problem I can see with this idea is that too often
	older 944's that are beat up (door dings, bad a/c, etc.) have
	often had their maintenance skimped on as well. Things like oil
	changes around 10K miles or so, trans. oil never changed, air
	filter never cleaned, timing belt never changed, leaky water
	pumps, etc. This would *not* be the kind of car you'd want to
	put in a Club Race and you could easily spend 5K just fix
	all these little things. You'd have to be really lucky to find
	a car that is cosmetically in poor shape but mechanically sound.
	However, I've seen stranger things...:)
