Guys,

Yesterday (Jan 8) I received a ten page fax from IMSA concerning new
developments and press releases.  Thought you'd like to hear some of the new
stuff:
	(1) Virgin Interactive Entertainment, a division of Spelling Entertainment
and a subsidiary of Viacom, will be a sponsor for the Exxon Supreme GT Series
through the year 2001.  The series will be known as the Exxon Supreme GT
Presented by Virgin Interactive Series.  (I guess that means we will still
have to use their horrible gasoline BUT that the series is much more secure
with the new sponsorship.)
	(2) Chrysler Corporation will be a presenting sponsor for the 1997 Exxon
Superflo 12 Hours of Sebring.
	(3) Officials of IMSG, the parent company of IMSA, has announced the
acquisition of Sebring International Raceway.
	(4) Officials of IMSG, the parent company of IMSA, has announced the
acquisition of Mosport Park.
	(5) Jack Long (with a background in IRL, CART, Formula One and Formula
5000), has been named as CEO of IMSA and IMSG.
	(6) IMSA has formed a new marketing, licensing and properties division
composed of Roberto Muller, Jack Long, Tom Carmody, Joe McCarthy and Kurtis
Eide.
	(7) It now appears that all GT Series races will be three hours in length
with the exception of Daytona (24) and Sebring (12).  They have added Las
Vegas Motor Speedway, Pikes Peak International Raceway, Laguna Seca Raceway
and cancelled the Grand Prix of Dallas.  The new schedule is:

	Feb 1-2  -  Rolex 24 at Daytona
	March 15  -  12 Hours of Sebring
	April 20  -  Grand Prix of Atlanta
	May 26  -  Lime Rock Park
	June 1  -  Watkins Glen
	July 13  -  Sears Point
	August 17  -  Mosport Park
	September 20  -  Las Vegas
	September 28  -  Pikes Peak Raceway
	October 18  -  Sebring
	October 26  -  Laguna Seca Finale

All of the above would indicate to me that the new ownership of IMSA is
serious about producing a world class racing organization and that we might
even see a time when there are more fans than racers.  My only problem with
all of the above is (A) why didn't they make these changes about six months
ago and (B) why don't they create a track in Utah.

Thought you might like to know . . .
