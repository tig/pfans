On June 13 & 14 1997 the Lone Star Region Porsche Club of America will be 
hosting a Porsche Club Race at Texas World Speedway - 'Deep in the Heart of 
Texas'.  Located between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in Bryan/College 
Station TX.  (Proud home of Texas A&M Aggies)

TWS is one of the fastest, if not 'the' fastest oval in the U.S.  It is built 
with a surface "as smooth as a baby's bottom", too.  (Modeled after Michigan.) 
The 1.8 mile road course we will be using is located between the steep 2 miles 
of bank and utilizes the front straight for added thrills and excitement.  
Dropping into turn one can be VERY exciting! Just ask the IMSA guys that race 
there.

This Porsche Club Race is open to all PCA Club Racers and will be held the 
weekend prior to this years Parade in San Antonio TX.  As is the tradition,  
the event will be on Friday and Saturday before Sunday's Parade kickoff the 
15th.   

An open lapping day will be held on Thursday the 12th.  The anticipated cost 
are:
 $100 for lapping day (optional, of course)
 $250 for the race (Friday & Saturday)
As always- great racing, great friends, great food & GREAT FUN.

Also,  send me an email with your name, mailing address, email address & phone
