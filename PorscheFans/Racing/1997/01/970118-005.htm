All,

	I realy think the cost of the car is not the deal, what it is the 
cost to repair, and In that case the 914 is the winner!!

Tap a rail with a 944 and unless you take a hammer to it yourself you are 
going to spend a grand or more.  Also a 944 can let you think you know 
what your doing until its tooo late. What I mean is that a 944 is a very 
forgiving car (I have driven them from 1983) and they let you think your 
a good driver  until they reach the end of the limit, and then thats 
where the klearning comes in, and thats a bad place to learn how to 
recover. The 14 is not as forgiving and you can start learning at a lot 
slower (less damage) speed. As for cost My race car a 73 - 14 2.ol cost 
me $1200 nad a rebuild and race prep added in about 2500. 

All in all the class is smaller, more forgiving, and best of all the Guys 
with the BIG bucks, who prep a stock car to a level that questions the 
word stock, whould not be seen dead in a stock 914 class, so you have a 
chance of compeating on a level playing field.
