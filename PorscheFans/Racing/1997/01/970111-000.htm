Saw some talk about SpeedVision so I thought I would throw in my 2 cents.  I 
live in Wisconsin and I did two things this year to get me through the winter 
(absolutely hate it!): 1. Bought a new computer to get serious about the 
Internet, 2. Bought and installed a satellite dish for one reason - to get 
SpeedVision.

I have now been watching SpeedVision for 3 months and if you like road racing 
and rallying and can afford it, get it!  I have watched Super Cup, One Lap of 
America, the BPR series from Europe, racing in Australia, Tasmania, South 
America, South Africa and USA.  Earlier in the year, I saw the complete Le 
Mans race on tape (3 tapes) that a fellow PCA member taped from SpeedVision.  
They also cover boat racing (sailing, drag and hydros) and aircraft (EAA 
Convention and air races).

A few days ago, Brock Yates, did a retrospective on Supervision's first year.  
They opened their doors December 31, 1995. It too was great!

By the way, the dish has a couple of hundred other channels but who cares?  
Oh, other than there are 3 ESPN channels and they carry some racing too!

I know the above probably sounds like a commercial but it isn't.  Time to go - 
- go out and blow about a foot of snow out of the driveway.  Did I mention I 
hate winter!
