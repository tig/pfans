Guys,

Just got back from an eight day trade show and was excited to read the
comments about PCA Club Racing.  I sincerely hope that those of you who feel
there are problems with the program make sure that Alan F. gets to hear about
them as the way the program gets changed is for national to hear from you.
 Just a couple of personal comments:

It's great that we already have a history and that revisionism has already
started :-{) !  A couple of you have commented about "how it used to be" and
I guess I missed those races.  I attended the first race ever (Second Creek),
the first one at Pocono, Road America,  Road Atlanta, Heartland Park, etc.
 At those "firsts" there were 18 wheelers, open trailers, closed trailers and
two or three guys who drove to the track.  True, there are more enclosed
trailers in attendance these days, but there are still guys who drive to the
track and race (and, when something happens, they are forced to try to find
someone who can get them home).  

Also, True that PCA Club Racing is more competitive than it used to be.  Why
shouldn't it be?  People now have two, three, four or five years of
experience that they didn't have back there at Second Creek.  Further, who
wants to go racing if it isn't competitive?  This isn't driver's ed or time
trialing - it's serious wheel to wheel racing and one of the real rushes is
the level of talent that we get to race against.  The Scott Peeler that Ted
mentioned:  He ran half of '95 and all of '96 in the IMSA street stock series
in a 968.  He's good, huh?  Two years ago I wouldn't have let him drive my
suburban in a straight line on I-15.  If you think that being more
competitive is a shame, you're missing what racing is all about.

We define winning as doing the best you can and having a great time while
doing so.  That's how it was defined at Second Creek, that's how it's defined
today.  There are, of course, those who will do anything to cross the finish
line first but the program is built around the stock classes and running
within the rules.  There are those who will cheat to get that expensive first
place trophy, but the perception of cheating is so much higher than the
actual number of cheats that it's almost a joke.  Do you really think that
the only thing that has been checked on you and your car was the weight for


the past five years?  You haven't been watching the scrutineers as they pour
over timing sheets and check inside and under cars.  You haven't heard the
number of class changes that they mandate (and those changes are passed on to
subsequent races).  Still, most of the talk about cheating comes from guys
who were beat by a better driver.

But, let me take it a step further:  First, the fact that someone might have
been cheating never took a great deal of my psychic energy when I ran in the
stock classes.  I could never understand how anyone could get any enjoyment
out of crossing the finish line first when they were cheating - they must
spend their entire life wondering if they could have won on a level playing
field.  More importantly, when I knew for a fact that someone was cheating
(it happened once in 23 races), I made sure that he got to see a lot of my
rear bumper.  Second, if you know that someone is cheating and it bothers
you, go to the chief scrutineer and tell him you would appreciate it if he
would check out that car.  It's that simple.  You don't have to form a
committee and you don't have to attack him/her in the paddock.  Be aware,
however, that you probably won't get a lot of feed back from the scrutineer
or the steward.  Just as we don't discuss 13/13s, we don't make a big deal
out of rules infringement (in public).  We just fix the problem.  (This year,
however, for gross infringement of the rules we do have a bit of a public
flogging in the works).  Maybe if we made a bigger deal of sanctions that
have been dealt out the talk of cheating would ebb, but the program is about
hugs and atta boys and we don't wash our laundry in public any more than
necessary.

It just isn't true that the grass roots/stock class cars have been squeezed
out - not in the East, West or Mid-West.  Proportionally we might have more
GT class cars than we did six years ago but the over-whelming preponderance
of entries come from the stock classes and most of those are not
professionally prepped cars or teams.  We will have 220 race cars in five run
groups at Sebring next month.  Four run groups will be composed of stock
classes.  If we get Kelly-Moss, Bob Johnson, etc., etc. down there, maybe ten
of the 170 stock class cars will be professionally prepped team cars.
 Further, if you want your car to perform like a killer Bob Johnson car,
phone him and he'll tell you how to do it and it will not cost an arm and a
leg.

Finally, one of the most positive thoughts that has come out of this exchange
has been the need for more and better communication.  I think this forum is
really great for an exchange of ideas but for the dissemination of
information such as race results, with all of the information, the newsletter
is the answer.  My buddy Bruce B. gave us all of the reasons why it couldn't
be done but none of these are insurmountable problems:  It would not take
Mike any more time to include all of the information and if PCNA is too cheap
to sponsor a more useful (longer) newsletter, it's time to get another
sponsor.  PCA Club Racing is THE driving force (pun intended) in PCA today
(although the Parade people are having a hard time with the concept) and
everyone, including PCNA, knows it.  Still, don't expect to see in print why
someone was dq'd (see above) . . .  if you want that kind of information,
refer to SCCA's Sports Car magazine (last 100 pages of each and every issue).

This program is for everyone with a Porsche who is a little nuts and can
afford the toll.  It is still about hugs, way to gos and good, clean
competition.  Costs and the level of competition have grown but that's to be
expected.  Still, much of the program is in your hands - if you suspect
someone is cheating, talk to the scrutineer; if you sense that someone does
not have the right attitude, talk to the steward (he'll thank you), etc.  One
of the funniest things anyone has ever said to me was at Lime Rock last year
when one of the competitors complained to me that I should have stopped the
race as he thought it was too slippery out there and he was scared most of
the race.  It never registered with him that he is the program; that if he
thought it was too slippery out there, he could (should) pull into the pits
as, doing the best he could, he was not enjoying it.

I won every PCA Club Race I ever entered in the stock classes!  At one of
them, Bob Johnson was in my class and finished ahead of me getting the first
place trophy (I know he was cheating :-{) ) but it was more fun than
finishing on the podium in SCCA Pro World Challenge.  At the next race, I
finished in front of him (he must have had car problems), but I won both
races and so did he.  Neither of us could stop grinning for days and, more
importantly, we will always be friends.  I will always smile when I see Lance
Flynn as he reminds of the fun we had in competition three and four years
ago.  Ted Smith will always get a hug because of the pleasure he has given me
as I've watched his progress behind the wheel.  That's what it's all about.

Monte
