The Friday ESPN2 broadcast listed the top fifteen qualifiers in each
division.  According to the report, Stuck's brakes went away and the
team hadn't (at that point) figured out what happened...although the car
put in good numbers in Friday qualifying and was well up the list
(around 5th/6th in class, if I remember correctly).
