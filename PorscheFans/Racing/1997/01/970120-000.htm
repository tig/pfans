John:

Consider the track at Holtville; it's about ten miles east of El 
Centro.

Holtville's sorta rugged -- no trackside services to speak of -- but
it IS cheap... Track rental is $50 per car per day.

Surface is adequately-maintained concrete (it's an old military
runway), with good runoff (no Willow Springs-esque ditches and holes
to fall into), and no elevation changes.  The SCCA sets up their
standard course with cones; I think they'll let you use their cones
to set it up any way you like (or you can just treat it as a big
out-and-back with a sweeper at each end).

To schedule a day of testing at Holtville Airdrome International
Raceway, call Aviation Concepts Enterprises, Inc., at 619 356-4641. As
I said, it's $50 per car per day.

They want at least one week's notice, and they charge $10 per rig for
overnight camping at the track.

Trackside camping is kinda cool at Holtville -- it's way out in the
boonies and gets REAL quiet and dark at night -- but I prefer to stay
at the Barbara Worth Hotel (800 356-3806); it's only about ten miles
from the track, and it's got a really great restaurant, a HOT Jaccuzi
and two pools (heated and non-heated).  It also has what's reputed to
be one of the nicest golf courses in the area, if you're into that
sort of thing.  Rates are very reasonable... $50/night or so.

When you reserve your track time, make sure you get detailed
directions from the freeway... The track's a little hard to find.

Oh... And keep in mind what I said about there being no trackside
facilities.  If you need power, bring a generator.  If you need air,
bring a compressor and tank.  Holtville's also in serious desert
country... Bring plenty of water.

Also, that $50 per car per day fee doesn't include an ambulance,
although I'm sure the Aviation Concepts people can arrange one if
you require it.
