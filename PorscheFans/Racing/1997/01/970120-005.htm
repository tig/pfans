Re-reading this thread and had some additional comments: 
 
>who don't have mucho bucks if they have to spend $15,000 on a suspension on 
 
My car BTW is not equipped with the high buck stuff.  A friend of mine made 
the adjustable shock perches and camber plates for example. Mention this by 
way of wanting to encourage anyone who's thinking of going Club racing to go 
do it.  You don't need all that big buck stuff. 
 
Tony Morelli is from S. Cal.  I think this was his first time at Sears.  This 
was also a new car for him, second time out with the turbo.  Ran a 944 normal 
for a couple  of years before that.  Just filling in the blanks.Not trying to 
take away anything from  Scott who did a great job in that race.   
 
The one thing I feel we need a lot more of in Club Racing is information.  I'd 
like to have results from each race telling me more than the name of the guy 
who won and his class and time.  What was he driving? Who was dsq's and for 
what. The race articles in Pano and Excellence are good but don't really 
contain enough info.  I see that PCNA is sponsoring the newsletter. I assume 
this means more $ for it.  I emailed the editor and volunteered to help(I was 
the editor of a Shelby Club newsletter).  He said thanks but he had it 
covered.  Does that mean we get a thicker newsletter?  With more details? 
 
Any thoughts, ideas, comments?
