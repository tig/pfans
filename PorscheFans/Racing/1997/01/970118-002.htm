I'll throw my $0.02 into this thread.  I became a PCA & BMWCCA instructor
for the first time last year.  Now I'd like to get into some form of wheel
to wheel racing but a recent divorce has left me without a Porsche right
now (used to drive a 951S).  I've considered getting a 914 or a 1st gen 944
for PCA club racing or maybe a 320 for the BMW series.  Then there's an
RX-7 or MR2 for SCCA IT racing.

The BMW series is more appealing to me right now because of the reasons
that Jerry states about the PCA series on the East Coast.  I just don't
have cubic $$ to throw at a race car to run against people who would break
the rules to take home a $10 trophy.  SCCA is out because I've heard horror
stories about people driving in the IT series with _no_ high-speed
experience and causing accidents.  I don't need people banging me in the
corners just for the hell of it.  I think the BMW series right now is where
the PCA series was a few years ago.  The same problems will probably hit
that series as well.  There were a few people at the Pocono race with
really ($$$) well prepared cars.

So, what did I decide?  None of the above.  I'm going to buy a Go Kart.  I
can get into the sport for as little as $2K depending upon which class I
choose.  $4-7K will get me a 125cc shifter kart that's capable of going
really, really fast.  A set of 4 slicks runs about $140 and I might go
through 3 gallons of gas in a race weekend.  David Donahue uses a 125
shifter kart to hone his skills for his pro racing.  There's a good
half-dozen tracks with a couple hour drive of where I live and I can
probably go racing every weekend if I so desire.  Entry fees start as low
as $30.

Is that the right decision?  Who knows, ask me next year.
