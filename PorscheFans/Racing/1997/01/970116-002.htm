Jay,
Your post struck home with me as I have been mulling over what kind 
of car to buy in order to get back on the track -initially for PCA 
driver-ed and later SCCA IT and/or PCA club racing.

I'm favouring buying an older 944, maybe I can find one with busted 
A/C, door-dings etc. but good mechanically & straight clean body for
under $3K. These cars are a much more modern design than a 914,
less prone to rust etc.  A few more $K for suspension, safety gear 
etc. and you'd be racing. Of course a 914 makes a fine race car as 
well, but is a different kind of beast - just depends what you're 
into.
I think in order to run either of these cars, you've got to be 
willing to do plenty of work on them yourself, or be willing to spend 
more than the value of the car having it brought up to spec. and 
maintained by a shop. I'm in the former category - I love working on
my cars & have a nice garage with air tools etc.

I'd appreciate comments from the listers on this topic - suitable 
entry-level, low-budget track Porsches and their pro's & cons.

Cheers,
Nick Craft
