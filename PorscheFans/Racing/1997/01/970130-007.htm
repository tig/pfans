Hi,

A few questions as I just picked up an '86 944 (still
looking for a good engine!) and am considering if I can make
it a dual-purpose car (legal for both SCCA solo-II and club racing).

I know it will be less than optimal, but how would a 944
handle on the track with stock springs, but bigger front sway
bar (only if necessary, as it's legal), Sport shocks, 8 and 9" 
wide rims, sticky R1 tires, and a competition
alignment? My 911S with this combo is a handfull on the
track but hopefully the better balance of a 944 will make it OK.

Anyone with an idea of how much slower the stock springs
will be, or if the car will be too hard to control, please advise.

Also a question on stock options : my car has the optional
16" forged fuchs alloys (option 395). The wider wheels
are on the front!! (Owner was a 17 year old female dead head...).
Are both the 15" and 16"
optional forged alloys on the '86 7" and 8" wide? I have
a few sets of 911 7s and 8s by 15 that I hope to use in SCCA
(15" = better gearing) and plan to use 16" or 17" by 8 and 9
for PCA (don't allow lower diameter tires). Maybe use the
stock 8x16 on the front and a 9x16 or 17 on the rear,
if they will fit???

Also my '86 has the option 456 which is "sport shocks
and swaybars". Are the struts the same, just a different
insert? Are the swaybars bigger both front and rear?

Anyone with race parts for sale (roll bar/cage, lightweight
racing seat, carbon pads, etc) or an engine please let me know.

Thank you for your help, these cars with waterlogged engines
are new to me.

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S, '86 944
