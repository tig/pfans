(My first message to the group, so please be kind)  Nick, I recommend you
email Bob Viau at AutoEdge in St. Paul, MN:  AutoEdge@telepool.com.  Bob is
a very talented mechanic who takes the 44's to the max - be it stock or
modified.  He is also one of the world's nicest people - honest,
trustworthy, brave and true.  (Don't know if he is a Boy Scout!)  Feel free
to use my name.  Regarding the step from the C2 Turbo S2 to the 944:  Never
having owned one of these beauties, I can't speak from personal experience.
(I will admit, however, to serious car lust!)  A dear friend recently went
from a C2 to a 914 after he saw Elvis during a spin at Brainerd's high speed
turn 1.  (He said Elvis told him to buy a 914...)  He freely admits he will
bring along reading material for the mile long main straight at BIR, but
that the "fun factor" in the corners and in the racing in his group is just
as good as it was in the C2.  It's all a matter of attitude.  
Teresa Vickery
