AFter having read the mail on Club RAcing I have to wade in for a few comments.
First, I've been racing in the program for four years since the first Road
America event, have been race director for two events and now am the
national sponsor coordinator (no, I can't help you get sponsors for your car
- if you need sponsorship for you car get out of the program and buy a
go-cart).  With that in mind I must admit that I have a certain amount
invested in the program.
However, like most porschefan list people I apparently have to count my
pennys to see if I have tow gas to get to the events.  Yes, the amount being
spent in the GT classes is obsceneand even in the higher stock classes.
However, what's important here is the closeness of the racing, not how fast
you can go overall.  If it was simply how fast you can go you should buy a
Ducati 916 and really scare yourself.
The other thing that many people seem to miss is that it's the people, not
the racing.  Gee, I don't see ESPN at the track, Road & Track hasn't seemed
to follow it too much and Speedvision doesn't even see it on the radar.
Although we've all got egos, your wife (or in some of our cases, dog) won't
love you any less the next day if you don't win GT-6R at Willow (there's a
thought, enter a class where you're the only car).  Guys, this is just for
giggles and should be treated that way.  I realize that certain people and
their shops aren't doing that but still believe that the majority of the
entrants are in it for the fun, adrenalin and good times.
Perhaps if you are concerned about the future of the program you should get
actively involved.  Every region has trouble getting people to volunteer to
work the events.  Any of them would be happy to have you help.  On a
national level, I'm sure that Alan F would be more then willing to have
people come on board to help with the scrutineering,  sponsor coordinating,
newsletter or whatever. frankly I dont' see any reason why most people would
want to be a steward as it is a truly thankless job but if you have lots of
experience and don't mind being criticized mercilessly, call Alan and
volunteer for that.  The point is, the program is us, not some monolithic
entity (gee, does SCCA come to mind?)
Now, a final point.  I challenge anyone to find an illegal part on the SC
that is running in G from Minnesoda (yah, sure, you betcha)  I had an
interesting discussion with a racer who I met over the net who ran against
it at the Calif races who, correctly, pointed out that it gets pulled to
beat the band at the starts.  The car, having crawled all over it since I
race against it myself, is simply very well set up within the rules.  MOre
importantly, the changes that they made (which I'm doing this winter) are
fairly inexpensive, any dweeb can do them and only work if you can drive.
And I emphasize the word drive.  The dad in that group has extensive
experience in vintage, SCCA and drove Trans Am.  The kid is simply a great
athlete who doesn't have to pay for his car damage (wouldnt that be great?)
Ship your car to their shop and you'll see what they do.  It aint  rocket
science and IMHO is not cheating.  Rather, they simply drive better with a
car that is properly set up.  Get some seat time in a properly set up car
and you can catch or beat them.  Bruce Boeder
