Hi All, 
I don't have an e-mail program where I can easily copy text I want to 
comment about, so just consider this part of the thread about club raing.   
        I think club racing is the best thing ever to come out of PCA. 
Because of it I've been able to drive as hard as I can at Sebring, Road 
Atlanta, Road America, Brainerd Intl, Heartland Park, Putnam Park, Second 
Creek, Pocono, and Mid Ohio. And more tracks are becoming available every 
year.  To keep costs down I do virtually all my own preparation , so I know 
my Porsche a lot better than BCR (before club racing). Best of all I'm a 
much better driver than BCR (but unfortunately not the next coming of 
Senna). 
        In 25 races I've never had an engine problem (that's one main 
reason to stay in a stock class - assuming one has a truly stock engine as 
the rules require) and I sure in heck have never gotten into a fight with 
an official (whoever did that is a real STUPID guy) or another competitor.  
As a matter of fact there is a lot of comraderie and I've made a number of 
friends I never would have met otherwise in club racing. 
        The down side is I have had one incident of car damage when I spun 
and backed into a wall at Heartbreak er Heartland Park. (I've subsequently 
found out this isn't too unique  - there is a club of sorts whose members 
proudly (?) wear their Heartland Park "Wallbangers Club" t-shirts.)  My 951 
is licensed and believe it or not the Liberty Mutual auto insurance policy 
contains No restriction whereby they don't pay if you're racing the car.  
So I even came out of that OK. 
        My big beef which has been echoed by others here is the cheating in 
stock classes.  The idea that the friendly racers would police themselves 
was from the beginning totally naive on the part of the national 
organizers.  The tone of the recent newsletters is that this will change 
and the scrutineers will take some initiative to check the cars.  I really, 
really hope this happens. Some of the stuff that got by at the races I've 
attended was ridiculous.  If the car made weight not even clearly visible 
non complience with the rules was questioned. We'll see what happens. 
        I'm hoping to make the race at Sebring on  Feb 16 (it was -12 on 
the thermometer here so FL sounds very good), but there's some things at 
work that make that still a maybe.  Anybody else on this list going? 
        BTW, I noted that Jerry cc'd one message to racing@PorscheFans.com. 
 Is that another list that might be of interest to me?  If so could 
somebody remind me how to subscribe to it.  Thanks

Hi Lance, subscribe to: racing@porschefans.com...... 
 
Glad you're having great experiences with Club racing.  And yes, them 4 
cylinder water pumpers are durable as hell in stock form. 
 
I agree with your comments on cheating in the stock classes.  I haven't seen 
much that was obvious and if something was brought to the scrutineers 
attention he reacted to it.  What kind of 'visible' non compliance have you 
seen?  The only thing I've seen is one of my competitors running the illegal 
2:25x50x15s on a 944.  I pointed this out to her in Portland and she seemed 
upset that I mentioned it.  It was clear that she was aware of the rule but 
somehow I was the bad guy for pointing it out.  I just ignored her attitude 
and she moved up a class.  She showed up at Sears 3 months later with the same 
tires.  I didn't say anything as I was running a lot faster than she, home 
track and all.  She finished third and the guy who finished 4th protested her 
tire size and got moved up to third.  He happens to write for Excellence and 
was doing a story about his experience with Club racing. We'll see how he 
handles that in the article. 
 
It sounds like the scrutineering  is going to get better(tighter) this year.  
A good thing no doubt.  Oh and that spelling was "L i b e r t y  M u t u a l", 
right?
