You will lose some weight with headers right where you need it.
But the lap times will not suffer much - the SSI's flow very well
and are 5 pounds lighter than the stock early heat exchangers
on each side. Much lighter than stock SC setup.
Some headers are available with extensions to fit a '74 muffler.
I'd say keep the SSI's until you are driving to your best potential
and see how your car stacks up against others.

As I read the rules you can use 9" on the rear, as factory were 8x15
optional and you are allowed 1" wider than stock.
And those tires should be OK for the rolling radius
but I don't have a chart.
