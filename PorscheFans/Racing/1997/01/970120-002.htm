Jay, 
 
No offense taken.  Apologies not necessary but accepted.....email has it 
limitations in terms of conveying proper sentiment...... 
 
 <What would a GT4 944 cost me by comparison? 
 
By comparison, probably as much as a GT4 914.  I ran the probable hp/weight 
numbers on this one(2.7 motors) and I think the edge goes to the 914.  The 2.7 
six will put out more dependable hp than a 2.7 944 car.  You're looking at 
15-20 large minimum for a competitive car.  
 
<I haven't done 
	anything at all. No track, no autocross, no Club Racing, no go 
	kart racing, no skateboarding, etc. 
 
Hmmm, skateboarding.......wonder if I should incorporate that into my training 
regimen..........The usual order of experience in PCA is autocross, time 
trial, then Club Racing.   Autocrossing teaches car control real well but IMHO 
isn't (gonna get flamed big time) necessary or even desirable for road course 
track events.  I've seen many people move into the time trial series with no 
prior training.  The instruction program in our region, GGR, is pretty good 
and the events are well run so novices move up pretty quickly and safely. 
 
<The rod bearings (#2) are much 
	more likely to go a 944 than a 914. 
 
Historically, thats probably true.  I've had no bearing problems with mine.  
But, I have an 88 pan and baffle.  There are one or two other 944s I can think 
of that we've driven the crap out of with no problems.  I think the 944 is 
very durable, if you're aware of and track wear points, etc. It's also 10 
years newer than a 914 and less prone to rust.  There are definitely tradeoffs 
there.  I've got 2 912's, one's a vintage racer.  I've worked on a couple of 
914s.  The 944 isn't any more difficult to deal with than the others but maybe 
that's just me.  
 
I've made my choices about what to race largely on bang/buck scenarios.  I 
decided on the 944 over a 914 and the 911.  I'm very open minded and have 
owned many 356's, 911s, a 930, 944 and 944TS.  My next trackcar may be 
air-cooled. I looked recently looked at a 914 with a big 6 in it but decided 
against it. Whatever it is you can bet it will be the most bang/buck car I  
can put together to be competitive in a particular class.   
Anyway, go get something and get started........ 
 
Ted

	What would a GT4 944 cost me by comparison?

	I guess I was vague again. What I meant was that I haven't done
	anything at all. No track, no autocross, no Club Racing, no go
	kart racing, no skateboarding, etc.

	The rod bearings may be $90. I can't do the rod bearings on a 944
	or a 914. My shop charges $62/hr. labor so this makes it a very
	expensive proposition for me. The rod bearings (#2) are much
	more likely to go a 944 than a 914.

	Of course any car is upgradable. The question is price. The 914
	is cheaper to upgrade than the 944 is my point.

	No, that's exactly my point. 17K is too much money and sweat and
	tears for me to invest in a car that can get destroyed. I can buy
	4 914's for that price and be safer and still have fun and learn.
	Believe me, guys, the *last* thing you want to see at your next
	Club Race is me behind (or in front) of you in a 951!
