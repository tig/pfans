Hey Jay,  
 
Didn't know if you had seen this or not.  
 
In the words of my mechanic here in Annapolis, "these cars are more or  
less bulletproof".  Particularly the normally aspirated breed.  After  
two years with a 1978 924 whose electrical system had been tampered with  
and just would not behave, my mechanic convinced me that my money would  
be better invested in a 944.  Today I have an 85.5 944 5-speed with over  
313,000 original miles and no rebuild in sight (40mpg hwy/ 32mpg cty).   
Needless to say, I change my oil if the wind blows and heed ALL  
recommendations concerning belts, filters, and water pump.

This is in reference to the $1100 used motors I mentioned as race motor 
replacements in stock class.  Do the bearings, freshen heads and track time.... 
 
I'll be quiet now...... 
 
 
 
Ted
