Dear Pfans,
have my second set of A008RS on 944, still a great tire.
Use them only for track work, with low pressure all round.
After much trial and error, found 28psi all round was the trick for a 944.
Incidently my Tire guy, said that you have to heat cycle them once before 
use and then they will last and work better. He recommends 5 laps warm up, 
two really hot laps, then five laps warm down, then put them away for at 
least 24 hours. This definitely does work with the A008RS. 
These tires are worth (on my car and me driving) three seconds a lap over any 
standard road doughnuts. Slightly better than Bridgestone 610S and other 
road legal (when you buy them) track tires.
Unfortunately we can't get the R1's in Oz.
Joe Martens,
'86 944
