no need to start with a slow 914... but a powered up or 2L is a decent
starter car that can be time trialed, scca vintage raced & pca club
raced, 914-6's are allowed in VARA exhibition status but not 4's, & any
67 or older porsche can be run w/ most of the vintage clubs... sorry
guys, but 944's need not apply.

Most racing orgs have a school, VARA just does a fri nite grd session
with talks after ya go out there solo, VARA also has a Univ of VARA
school coming up at Streets of Willow, after getting novice permit you
race two more events solo & get lic.. it's an easy & low pressure way to
go 
SCCA SFO region has a terrific school coming up at Thunderhill in which
you are sent out solo and told to go faster & given talks after every
session (instructors on every corner taking notes on you)...scca can be
more intimidating since ther are lots of hot shoe youth in the field,
and the aggressiveness is uncomfortable for the 13-13 vintage crowd, but
you will be a very capable novice when you complete this one.. not
everybody does get a permit, and some folks even break cars ... learning
to stay out of trouble & drive predictably in this kind of traffic is
one of the best lessons, but I used my vintage 914-6 & came thru
unscathed as did a colleague in a 356
Golden gate region has several time trials where new drivers can get
schooled, & the advantage is you get a live in-car instructor & also get
the ride of your life when you ride in THEIR car, but NO wheel to wheel
stuff allowed...
 bottom line is ya don't need to sneak up on the speed & wheel to wheel
experience, just go to a club school & talk to a lot of fellow "vintage"
weekend racers, and get out there & have fun .. plenty of faster folk
will give you the wheel to wheel experience as they pass...
