A fellow worker in another playback, e-mailed me yesterday saying I was
one lucky guy. I had yesterday off. (^_^) Apparently, several systems
failed during the day yesterday. What you saw may have been effected. I
won't be in until tomorrow to read how bad it was. So if it looked ugly
please accept apologies now.
