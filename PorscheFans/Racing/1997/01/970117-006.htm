Hi Jerry: 
 
I can appreciate your perspective about having to up the ante each year to 
keep up with cars in your class.  Last year I was thinking about building a GT 
car, like a GT2 924S with a turbo drive line. We figured we could do this for 
12-14K in parts.  I'm on the west coast and we only have 4 events that are 
within a days drive to run each year.  We quickly figured out on the  other 
coast and in the midwest there were similar cars that had 20K in their motors 
and  were pumping out 200 more hp.  Nope, won't go there.  Started looking at 
GT4 911s with 2.7s.  Nope theres' 25K for a competitive car.  And, the local 
west coast guys are now getting their wallets out. Maybe we'll build a GT5 
car.  Still running the numbers and options there. 
 
In the meantime, did the annual maintenance on the 944 and will continue to 
run it this year in the stock classes.  I think that the stock classes are 
still pretty grassroots in the west.  We see time trialers moving into Club 
racing, driving to the track, running and driving home.  I got a trailer in 
95, then an enclosed one for 96.  If I was gonna do 10 events a year and bring 
the other half I needed to provide some shelter from the sun and rain A 
weekend at the track is like camping and the enclosed trailer was a lot 
cheaper than a Winnebago. There's a major social element in all this and the 
trailer will function as a mother ship of sorts for the cars to gather around. 
 I've got the basics, floor jack, generator, compressor, tools and am happy to 
share whatever people need.  I think this is very grassroots type activity. 
 
I have a vintage car, 912. Vintage racing out here is a very different 
experience than club racing.  The way the run groups are set up, I often run 
against cars that should be faster than me and aren't and some that should be 
slower than me and aren't.  There's not much class equity so I don't have the 
expectation that I should be able to beat everyone in the group.  I just go 
out and have fun.   
 
The club classes are more evenly matched and cars are adjusted up and down to 
keep them equitable.  Because of this I expect that I should be able to outrun 
any car in my class and I approach club racing a little more seriously with 
higher expectations. As a result, I have a more competitive attitude for this 
than vintage.  Maybe that's helping to drive the difference you're referring 
to. 
 
I think the Club race exec committee is responding appropriately to the 
increased spending on cars.  This year they'll have the ability to check 
displacement and chips.  This should discourage some potential cheating and 
keep things on a more even basis. 
 
If you're on the east coast, things may be a bit different.  Seems like there 
are more events there and they've been at it a bit longer.  I think the 
grassroots orientation is very much a part of west coast racing and I hope we 
never lose that.  I remember the Sears race.  David Colman writes for 
Excellence.  I had never met him but after the race in the impound area he 
came up an introduced himself.  This was his first Club race and he had run a 
rented car in my class.  Jeez, was he excited.  I don't think he'd had that 
much fun in quite a while.  Thats' the kind of excitement I like to see 
generated by this activity. So, I guess it's up to us, the racers to keep 
generating feedback to the National guys about what we like and what we don't 
like in order to keep this racing fun.  We're better off griping and 
communicating our feelings rather than getting discouraged and just not 
showing up.  I think they're listening.........besides, where else would we 
take our Porsches to go racing? 
 
Didn't mean to be so long winded.  See you on the asphalt.....
