 Hmmm, skateboarding.......wonder if I should incorporate that into my
training 
 regimen..........The usual order of experience in PCA is autocross, time 
 trial, then Club Racing.   Autocrossing teaches car control real well but
IMHO 
 isn't (gonna get flamed big time) necessary or even desirable for road
course 
 track events.  I've seen many people move into the time trial series with no

 prior training.  The instruction program in our region, GGR, is pretty good 
 and the events are well run so novices move up pretty quickly and safely.

This is all true, but the requirements for applying for a Club Racing license
are a little more clearly defined.  You have to have completed at *least* 8
days of PCA Drivers Ed, *and* be signed off by your regions Chief Instructor
verifying not only your 8 or more days, but the fact that you have acquired
enough track driving skill to take the next step.  This rule applies to
people who have no prior racing experience and who are applying for a "Rookie
License".
