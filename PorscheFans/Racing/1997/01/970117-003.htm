I'd like to add to Ted's comments.......in my ten years of POC/PCA and 3 years of SCCA 
experience, I've found it true that SCCA is NOT a "Porsche-friendly" organization, and if 
your goal is to race SCCA, buy something else. However, you CAN race competitively in SCCA 
on a limited budget. Just pick the right class and car.

I recently sold my very competitive (two time Regionals champ, several track records, winter 
series/Saguaro series champ, etc) '79 RX-7 ITA race car for $4500. My total investment in 
the car was less than $6.5K. I did do most of the work on the car, except engine and gearbox 
rebuilds, and I could always pick up spare engine cores from the junkyard for $150, rear 
ends for $75, and fenders/doors for $50. A complete engine/tranny overhaul was less than 
$1500 and would be good for two seasons. This car would have been very competitive in ITS as 
well with an engine and other minor upgrades (say, $2500 to $3500 total).

HOWEVER, I also ran my 911 time trial car in POC X/M2 classes and SCCA GT-2 class.....the 
car was very successful in POC/PCA but was outclassed in GT-2, unless I wanted to invest big 
$$$ to keep up with the tube frame/ex-pro racing Mazdas and Nissans. Be prepared to spend 
big $$$ (at least $55K and up to $100K) to build up a competitive GT-1/2/3 car. I wouldn't 
build a GT-4/5 car, these classes are in perpetual danger of getting dumped by the Nationals 
committee.

The bottom line is this......Porsches are expensive cars. Racing just magnifies 
this. A new 944 was an expensive car, compared to a Mazda or similiar, and a cheap used 
Porsche still requires new Porsche maintenence and repair costs. With PCA racing growing in 
popularity, it will become harder and harder to be competitive, and thus the cost to race 
(competitively) will continually escalate. Just look at F-1, GT racing, NASCAR, or even 
POC/PCA for proof. Five years ago, my monocoque/stock suspension (geometry) based 911 was an 
FTD car....now you need an 3.8 RSR or $200K "Snow-mobile" to win overall.

If cost is an issue, stick with stock or improved classes, and remember....speed costs 
money, Modified and GT cars go very fast, how fast can you afford to go?
