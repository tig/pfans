Subject: Brake Upgrade for RS America

	A friend, who had upgraded the front brakes of a 1994 RS America to 1994
3.6 Turbo brakes, is looking to upgrade the rear brakes of the car.  What
he tried to do was to install the factory front calipers of the RS America
in the rear with factory C-2T rear rotors.  The calipers did fit but the
rotors didn't.  The hat of the factory RS America rotors is 3" tall and the
hat of the C-2T is 2"tall.

	Any clue of which rotors may be used for the upgrade?

	Nick
=================================================================
This may be after the fact since your friend is already commited to a setup 
but I was in Phoenix at Christmas and stopped at PowerHous and they have done 
brake upgrades to RS Americas.  They are nice people, too.
