Andy, that was a nice detailed message to Dr. John Reed regarding Holtville.
I'd also like to let everyone know that jeanne(doozy) and her husband and the
SCCA have been putting in some extra time at Holtville. Many of the holes
have been filled in. The surface is the best I've seen it since my first trip
out there in '85. The berm on the inside of the track,near end, has been
graded smooth(was a roll over hazard). there is now underground permanent
wiring for the cornerworker stations. There's even a small grandstand near
one of the turns now !! The track was made about 18 inches wider in 2
places(the dog legs).  AAAAHHHHHH, HOLTVILLE!!!  Steve McQueen ran a 908
there in 1970, you know.  I can remember seeing a tarantula walk right by my
corner working station in 1988 or so. Then, one walked right into our pit
area in 1994. One of our guys turned on his video camera and set it down in
the spider's path so that it walked right up to the lens.  Great footage.
 Hairy little #$%&*?. Seems like you always jump a jack rabbit if you cut
across the brush in the middle of the track (no, not in your car, on foot). I
just love that old place. Good racing memories. Well, anyway, you don't have
to brave all that, Dr. Reed. You can autocross & time trial at jack murphy
stadium here in San Diego.  We have fast tracks for autocrosses and we can
make a long, fast time trial track in that parking lot, too. No hotel cost,
no long drive, we serve lunch, beer afterwards, all for around $100. Contact
Dave Turner at Dave Turner Motorsports 619-571-3811. He holds practice days
at Holtville. If I can help you, call me.  Tim Comeau, SDR-PCA. 582-1913.
