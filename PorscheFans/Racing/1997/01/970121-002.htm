	Well, in the words of my shop and my experience on this
	list, the cars ain't bulletproof. It's a lot to say a
	car (an entire car, that is) is bulletproof. I can agree
	that some parts of the car are pretty bulletproof (electricals,
	suspension, etc.) but some parts need help. The damned clutch
	sucks. The water pump sucks. The head gasket bites. The oil
	cooler leaks. The steering rack is insane ($1000 installed).
	Any of the things I mentioned above can go out on a 944 and
	would be considered run of the mill items to an experienced
	944 owner. You just take it in stride and keep going. I'll
	bet some serious money that Dave doesn't have 313,000 miles on
	his original clutch and water pump :)

	Just for grins, I may call my shop and ask what they'd
	charge to "...do the bearings and freshen the head..." I'm
	sure the figure isn't going to put a smile on my face :)
