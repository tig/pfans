Hay Gang,

Just a retired crew chiefs perspective on Club Racing and SCCA racing, OK?
Jay.....Both organizations are fine groups to race with.  They are very safty
conscious and try to take precautions to make sure the drivers are competant
racers.  SCCA and PCA provide schools to learn behind the wheel requirements
of racing and offer on track schooling to prepare you for competition.   If I
were breaking in on a racing HOBBY, I would first look to some of the
grass-roots organizations as possibilities to get my experience with.  I
agree with Ted that PCA and SCCA are organizations that are filled with very
well funded racers in very well prepared cars.  Different regions will have
different group makeup so find a car you like to work on, can afford to build
and will be a safe driver.  914s and 944s are nice possible candidates.  If
you want to race and make isn't important look at all the classes and make an
educated choice.  Don't put yourself into a class that has no competition or
has too much competition.  You will find you are having more fun in a group
that is populated enough to give you a racing challenge.      
If you like the idea of Porsche racing my vote goes for the 914.  As a Dallas
resident and fan of the 914s I think they are good platforms to start with.
 No knocks on the 944 as it has proven its ability to race is equal to some
of the best.
Watch your calender for the next Hallett SCCA National race and if Jim
Blakewell is there he is pretty awsome in a GT 2 914-6.  It should be
rebodied by now and is a good example of how far a 914 can go in SCCAs GT
catagory.  Bryan Page's bright orange GT 3 is also a nice 914 racer that
frequents Hallett.  There are also several local PCA 914 racers that do well
at Hallett.  Carl Amond is preparing a mostly tube 914, Wayne Brown often
competes in his 914-6, Les Moncus has a nicely done 914-6 semi-tube racer and
Bob Krantz has a nice almost stock 2.0L he pushes pretty hard over the
"Bitch", if you know what I mean.
There is also a couple of other organizations you should check into.  CVAR
(Corinthian Vintage Auto Racing) is a race group that caters to an older
group of race cars.  Typically vintage racers and the 914 would fit in their
group.  Also look up COMA (Competition Motorsports Assn.) as they are a
common group frequenting Hallett.
Another option for you is to take in some of the racing school offered by
Stephens and use one of their spec racers.  They may not look extremely fast
but check their times adgainst some of the GT 3,4, & 5 cars.  Its another way
to start to learn weather or not you are going to like racing befor you dump
5, 10, or 20K into a usually unrecoverable investment.  For the most part
anyway.
If you are interrested in the 944 for a racer heed some of the advice already
posted as well as making a call to one of the guys at PowerHaus.  They had an
awsome 944T at Hallett for this years Parades Club race.  I believe it was
one of the faster cars on the track.
Good luck with what ever you do!
