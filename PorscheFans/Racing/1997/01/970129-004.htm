Hello,
        Bravo to Monte!  I sure want to thank him for a very eloquent
assessment of the club racing scene.  He put in a very unique perspective
of a racer and official who's been with the program from the beginning. 
For those that don't know, Monte is one of the PCA National stewards who
officiate at each event. He's gone pro with his driving, but we're lucky
he's been generous enough with his time to stay involved with the club
racing program. I for one am always happy when I arrive at a race and find
out that Monte is the steward for that weekend.  Things will run well.
        Based on the comments made about cheating though he and I may have
a small difference of opinion.  In SOME cases I have seen cars inspected
pretty well.  In others (IMHO, of course) the level of scrutineering has
been less than adequate.  Example: at Putnam Park in '96 the winner of E
was a 944 turbo cup car.  This car has no sunroof, no A/C, no airbag dash,
and God knows what kind of turbocharger, DME or KLR units.  The car rolled
into the tech shed, met weight, and rolled out with it's "victory".  I
don't think I should have to go to the scrutineers with such an obviously
misclassed car.
        On the other hand the things I read about for this year sound
encouraging.  Having 2 scrutineers will allow better checking.  I also hear
of a better ability to check chips and monitor boost.  This is great.
