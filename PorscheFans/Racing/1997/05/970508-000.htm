    Hi, James.

    My Bell AFX-1 Kevlar Pro cost just under $400 when I bought it a
    couple of years ago.

    Catalog prices for the SA95 version (mine's an SA90) are around
    $420.

    Yes, it's a full-face helmet; you can see pictures of it in the
    Racer Wholesale (800 886-RACE) or Pegasus Racing (800 688-6946)
    catalogs.

    It's best to try the helmet on WHILE wearing a hood... They're
    thin, but you might find that it makes a difference. 

    Speaking of which... If fire safety isn't a huge priority for
    you, you might want to try hoods with just a single wide eye
    opening instead of two separate openings; they're a little more
    comfortable and the make some people feel much less
    claustrophobic.

> LOL...helmet can never be to big for a POC member!!  LMAO!!!

    Glad you liked my little joke.  I hope it didn't offend anyone
    TOO much...
