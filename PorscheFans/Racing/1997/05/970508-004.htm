Clemson,

I recently had my first High Speed drivers ed event at Texas World Speedway
in College Station, so let me tell you a few of the things that I found
interesting or important or what ever.

1.  We were required to wear long sleeve cotton shirt and long pants, and
lace up shoes.

2.  It was required to sign up before hand...no show up and drive at our
event...the two days cost $150 and for that you got four 20 minute sessions
each day...160 min of track time...not bad.  I ended up doing about 200
racing miles.

3.  If a covered garage area is available pay for it!!  You will love a place
to get out of the sun or rain, depending on the weather.

4.  Take a hat, sun screen, cleaning stuff for your car, extra oil, tranny
fluid, power steering fluid etc, and/or check all of those before you go...we
were required to complete a Technical Inspection of our car before we even
got to the track which covered  all of that and more.

5.  Take it easy on the track for the first driving session and listen to
your instructor and follow his directions to the letter!!  People who don't
do what there instructors say often find themselvs spinning and sometimes
hitting stuff!!!!

6.  Watch your mirrors and let the faster people go around you and don't
drive over your abilities...that also puts you in a bad place, like the wall.

7.  In tight twisty stuff you may have even the lowly (power wise) 914 all
over you like a bad rash but when you hit a straight where you can air it out
a bit you leave him in the dust, only to see him right on top of you again in
the twisties... be a nice guy and slow down on the straight next time and let
him go by...he probably won't be in your way again, he will be gone as soon
as the road starts to twist again.

As I understand the difference between time trials and drivers ed is that you
are solo in time trials and they are keeping track of your time and award
prizes based on how fast you go reltive to the group that they slot you into.

Also from talking to friends down here in TX who have done the TT stuff it
seems like our Drivers ed events get you much more track time for the money.
 This can be variable from local to local though I guess.  Just depends on
how your PCA region wants to handle it.

Well, sorry that was so long...check out my home page guys and tell me what
you think.
