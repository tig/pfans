Low cost option:  Fast Wheels (advertise in Hot VWs) will make up a set of 
steel wheels to your specs for $174 for a set of four (plus shipping).  When 
you're within .001 seconds of your competition, mortgage the house and buy a 
set of hyperlight alloys (but not until then).  There are much more 
competitive places to put your money.

Or I could be wrong.

I am still on my quest for 6.5 or maybe 7 inch wheels for 74 2.0L 914.    I
am looking for availability and recommendations.   (4 x 130 bolt pattern
and approximate 5 inch backspacing.)

Panasports & Minilites are the most often suggested.   Minilites seem to be
very expensive and hard to come by.   Discontinued 7 inch ATS are an
option, too. Automobile Atlanta has two different brands for sale also.
Application is PCA/SCCA roadracing.    Is anybody using Duralights on their
914??

Still trying to find some used.   If you have some or know of availability
please forward.

Remember,  Texas Club Race at Texas World Speedway - before Parade - on
June 13 & 14th.
