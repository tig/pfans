Subject: Pads & Rotors

Problem---
=9186/=9287 944 Turbos with brake cooling kits-
Application: Drivers=92 Ed/PCA Club Racing
Padget Pads/slotted stock rotors:
Pros:  Great stopping=20
Cons: High heat, lots of dust, short rotor life(cracked rotors)
Suspect that in use the groved chamfer is ground off  such that heat stre=
ss
causes failures, also this =93edge=94 is slicing the pads causing excessi=
ve dust
and wear.

Opinions??

Hello,

This sounds like my '86 944T with cooling ducts, slotted rotors and Pagid
orange pads (RS4-4).  Time trial performance is excellent, but the rotors
eventually develop cracks, and the pads wear relatively quickly.  I'll offer
two opinions:

Cracks will generally form at stress risers.  Rotor slots and holes are stress
risers.  In my case the cracks appear randomly, and while ultimate failure may
be at a crack near a slot, these cracks seem to be independent of the slot
locations, and are probably simply a result of heat cycling.

While pad wear seems excessive on the front, it seems to be in line with pad
wear on the rear unslotted rotors.  My experience with Performance Friction
compound 80 pads, both with and without cooling ducts and slotted rotors, was
that they wore half as quickly as the Pagid orange pads, but consistently put
enough heat into the rotors to cause them to warp after say 10 minutes of track
time (after a few events, rotor cracks began to appear).  The Pagid orange pads
seem to manage this heat better, not heat warping the rotors, nor boiling the
brake fluid.  My far reaching opinion is that the Pagid pads management of
brake heat is a function of many factors, perhaps one being pad wear, and while
slots may contribute slightly to wear, this wear is normal.  Caveat:  As the
Pagid pads already have two 'gas slots' per pad, I may not go through the
trouble of slotting my next set of rotors.

It is hard to put all this together, and successful brake solutions for some
cars don't apply to the 944T's unique situation.  Within the Golden Gate Region
944T time trialers, this is the setup of choice, and it works for me.

Good luck,
