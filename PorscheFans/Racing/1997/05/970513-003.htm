>     Anyway, it has happened on a long hill/mountain each time. I admit it, it
     is quite likely I was lugging it in 5th up the long steep hills after being
     so tired and not paying attention to downshifting.  The car skips a beat,
     hesitates,  loses power. As long as I don't accelerate, it acts fine. But
     as soon as I press down on the gas, it skips and continues to lurch until I
     back off.  It starts off just feeling as if my foot slipped on the
     accelerator, and gradually worsens until I have to pull off the road.  The
     first two times it happened I didn't try to turn it back on until the next
     day, when it was fine.  Last weekend I pulled over and went back after
     twenty minutes... it started up fine.

I had a Toyota that would act like that whenever I neglected to
change the oil for too long. Apparently the lifters would pump
up, the valves would stop closing fully, the power (what there
was of it) would drop off more and more; I thought it felt
like a fuel problem too, but fresh oil & filter invariably
cured it. There may be something unique about the Camry's
lifters, but you haven't been neglecting your oil, have you
Karen?
