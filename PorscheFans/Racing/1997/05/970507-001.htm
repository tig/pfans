Andy,

Thanks so much for all of the info...best answer I have yet heard about the
helmet ???.  I used to race dirt bikes and rode street bikes alot, so I have
a fair amt of experience as to what kind of fit I like in a helmet.  I also
know that some of the best motorcycle helmet makers don't seem to do much for
SA applications (ie. Shoei, Arai, etc.).

I appreciate your view on helmets and would ask how much you paid for the
Bell.  I to like the Bell SA helmets (I was never a fan of the Bell
Motorcycle helmets however) are there any mail order places that I could
check out a pic of your helmet?  Sounds like it is a full face too, which is
what I am looking for.

I have been and will continue to participate in High Speed Driving schools
put on by PCA and probably at some point do some time trialing too.  So while
my driving is not as intense as F1 or IndyCar I still want excellent
protection and as you noted weight does make a difference on the fatigue
factor.  Also I have not ever used or tried one of the Balaclava's how much
play should there be if you plan on using one of those?  I was trying on some
of the helmets at the local Honda dealer and noted that a medium (virtually
every manufacturer that I tried) gave a very nice snug fit, and I thought
about whether or not I would need a balaclava and then thought that helmet
size might be a bit tight if a was put in a position where I needed one of
those....

As to the painting...my skills are not good enough to do what I would like to
see on my helmet and I have received a brochure from Herm Design and I think
I will ship my helmet to them for painting.

Thanks for all of the helpful info.

I appreciate it much.
