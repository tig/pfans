> 1. Front brake cooling ducts for 1985 911
>     There was recently a question about these ducts.
>     AJ-USA ducts and an other brand.
>     - I don't remeber any reply which one is better?
>     - From where can this other "brand" be inquired? 
> 
Cool Brake kit from OG Racing. 703-257-0009 or 800-934-9112. I've got
one and it seems to help.

> 2. Brake pads
>     There was also recently a lenghty discussion on the list about
> pads.
>     He who started it made a summary of it, could You post it to me,
> pls.
>     I have now Repco Metalmaster and was told that they are good

>     pads, but not so good on track. Well, they stopped my car.
> 
I am using Cool Carbon blue pads. A little squeaky and dusty, but they
work well both on the street and the track.

> 3. Left foot rest for 911.
>     AJ-USA has an "original Porsche" left foot rest in their
> cataloque.
>     I don't miss one, but when I drive a car with one, it feel quite
> nice.
>     Aldo, if I remember right You put one in Your previous 911? 
>     - Is there any benefit of having a left foot rest? 
> 
I have the AJ "dead pedal" and like it. I think it is more comfortable
than not having it. It also helps me brace myself when I am in a high G
corner at the track.

> 4. 5-point harness
>     - What 5-point harness is recommended?
>     - What would be a good / economical place to buy them?
>     I have the harness bar already in my garage.    
> 
Dave Turner Motorsports sells Simpson belts with extra hardware that
makes them easy to install in a 911. I have a set and like it a lot.

All of the above was gleaned from the back of Panorama, the Porsche Club
of America monthly magazine. It alone is worth the annual club dues.
