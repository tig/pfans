Hi Pfans,

Couple of questions that I am sure have been numerous time on
the list. Sorry for the repetition.
Hey Jim (listmaster), any idea to have these basic things in a 
Tech FAQ? 
I have my thumbs up, so the list would be up running as before, 
and a selfish tought, so I could subscribe to it.  

1. Front brake cooling ducts for 1985 911
    There was recently a question about these ducts.
    AJ-USA ducts and an other brand.
    - I don't remeber any reply which one is better?
    - From where can this other "brand" be inquired? 
    As I am a novice driver, I overbrake. Last time I was at Sebring
    my rotors turned to a nice blue colour, but I had fun.
    Brakes are stock.

2. Brake pads
    There was also recently a lenghty discussion on the list about pads.
    He who started it made a summary of it, could You post it to me, pls.
    I have now Repco Metalmaster and was told that they are good street
    pads, but not so good on track. Well, they stopped my car.

3. Left foot rest for 911.
    AJ-USA has an "original Porsche" left foot rest in their cataloque.
    I don't miss one, but when I drive a car with one, it feel quite nice.
    Aldo, if I remember right You put one in Your previous 911? 
    - Is there any benefit of having a left foot rest? 

4. 5-point harness
    - What 5-point harness is recommended?
    - What would be a good / economical place to buy them?
    I have the harness bar already in my garage.    

As You might guess, I'm coming over to USA, and have to stuff my
luggage with this and that.

The list is still rejecting me, is my writing so bad?, so please CC Your
reply directly to me also.
