Hello folks,

It appears that the lists were corrupt at the time of me sending this so
I am re-sending it so that I can see the responses.

I am currently building / restoring a 1971 911 E 2.2  for historic
racing here in Australia.  The engine that I am allowed to build under
the rules will effectively be a replica of the 2.3 ltr 911/20 or 911/22
(Carbs) engine.  Obviously a perfect scenario would be to find one of
the original engines.  This alias has been an excellent resource in the
past so I would love to hear from anybody that has or knows where to
locate a 911/20 or 911/22 engine.  

Failing that.  I would like to hear from anybody who has or knows where
to locate 85mm pistons and barrels.

Many thanks in advance

Azim
