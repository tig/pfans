     Karen, Pfans,
     
     I've had similar symptoms with my 911 and other vehicles.  It 
     invariably turned out to be a clogged filter.  If it were a weak pump, 
     I would also expect those symptoms when the engine is cold.
     
     My 911 has a screen in the fuel tank, in addition to the inline filter 
     in the engine compartment.  I don't know 944, but perhaps Porsche put 
     another filter or screen somewhere in your fuel system as well.
     
     Good luck,
     
     Bob Didner

     Subject: Intermittent 944 problem
     
     Hello, PorscheFans,
     
     I have had an aggravating problem occur to my 944 three times.  Each time
     it happened when I had driven my car hard -- twice after driving it for a
     day or two on the track, and once after a skiing weekend at high altitude
     at Lake Tahoe while driving it back.  I'm just really glad it hasn't
     happened on the track yet!
     
     Anyway, it has happened on a long hill/mountain each time. I admit it, it
     is quite likely I was lugging it in 5th up the long steep hills after being
     so tired and not paying attention to downshifting.  The car skips a beat,
     hesitates,  loses power. As long as I don't accelerate, it acts fine. But
     as soon as I press down on the gas, it skips and continues to lurch until I
     back off.  It starts off just feeling as if my foot slipped on the
     accelerator, and gradually worsens until I have to pull off the road.  The
     first two times it happened I didn't try to turn it back on until the next
     day, when it was fine.  Last weekend I pulled over and went back after
     twenty minutes... it started up fine.
     
     It _feels_ like a fuel problem to me--I had several Datsun Z's that would
     get clogged fuel filters and have the same symptoms, and replacing (or even
     wiggling) the fuel filter would cure it.  But I replaced my fuel filter,
     and it's happened twice since then.  My next guess is to replace the fuel
     pump.  But I hate to randomly replace parts, especially when they get
     successively more expensive.
     
     Does anybody have any suggestions, or has this happened to them?
     
     TIA,
