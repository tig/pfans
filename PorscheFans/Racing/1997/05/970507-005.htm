Lou,

I happen to have a pretty darn fast '78 911SC Targa with a stock '88 3.2
motor so I can give you some real useful information. The car is my daily
driver:

Torsions Bars:

Front: 21mm
Rear:  30mm

Sway bars:

Front: 22mm (Charlie Bar)
Rear:  25mm (Charlie Bar)

Camber:

-1.5 degrees all the way around

Shocks:

Custom valved Bilstein Sports (Werks II, Galen Bieker, 818-845-2530)

Wheels and tires:

Front: 8x15 Fuchs with 225/50R15 BFG R1s
Rear:  9x16 Fuchs with 245/45R16 BFG R1s

Of course you need to have the car profesionally corner balanced and the
ride height needs to be set low.

With this setup and I have the fastest street legal 911 at the San
Francisco area PCA autox events. Yes, I am a good driver, but the car is
special.

The car is more than comfortable to drive on a daily basis.
