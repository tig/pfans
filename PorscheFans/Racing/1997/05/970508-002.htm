Clemson & the list,

	>I know PCA-GGR is hosting the Time-Trial and Driver's Ed in 
	>the coming weekend. I would like to know what is time-trial 
	>and what is driver's ed?

Each region runs its driver's ed as it sees fit, so there can only be
somewhat generic answers to this question.  I can answer briefly for
GGRand others on the list can explain how they do it elsewhere.  
It's all driver's ed, even autocrossing, to distinguish it from actual racing 
(see PCA Club Racing program).  During a weekend, GGR runs 1.5 days 
of practicing in groups of about 25 cars each(with specific limits on where 
and under what circumstances passing may occur).  There are normally
five such groups of cars at the event.  Then, Sunday 
afternoon each driver has a chance to run 3 laps essentially alone 
(the other 3 or 4 cars on the track are very well spaced out) to see 
his/her best time.  Competition is organized into classes.

	>What will I need to prepare (my car and myself) before the 
	>driver's ed?
	>Do I need a racer outfit? (I have a helmet SA95)
	>Does my car need a roll-cage? or other safty equipments?

Varies by region.  To start with GGR you need non-synthetic shoes,
a long-sleeve cotton shirt & long cotton pants, a Snell 90 helmet, 
5- or 6-point belts for both front seats and a 10-bc firebottle firmly mounted
in a place reachable when you are strapped in.  You don't need a 
rollbar unless your car is modified beyond GGRs improved category.
After your first two events you will need a fire-resistant driving suit.  Your
car must be teched at an approved site (on-track tech can be done Friday
evening or perhaps Saturday morning but is limited and has a higher cost).

	>Normally, do I need to call and reserve my spot before I go 
	>there?

Yes.  All new entrants into the series (with the occasional exception of
drivers holding current SCCA or POC licenses) are students and must
attend a groundschool, normally 2 weeks before the event.  All event
entrants normally sign up well in advance in any case.

	>A lot of questions!!! Is better someone can point me to a 
	>Time-Trial and driver's ed FAQ.

You point out a need, and I will work to get the GGR site updated with
some entry time trial information.  In the meantime, if you want to see
what's there, check at

	http://www.glennhills.com/PCA-GGR_Web_Site/pca-ggr.html

To discuss further, and get you prepared for the next time trial, give me
a call this evening (or wait until next week, as I'm going to the time trial).
