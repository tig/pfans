Sorry for the late reply to the whole list but just got back and can't 
respond directly
since there was no signature with an address.  PLEASE SIGN YOUR NAME WITH
AN EMAIL ADDRESS so people can reach you directly.

I have 20mm front and 18mm rear (Carrera option) bars off my '74.  The 
front bar is NOT
through-the-body so that won't work.   Not sure about the rear bar but 
it's available
with end-brackets,  center bushings but no center brackets (I re-used 
those for the replacement
Weltmeister bars).     The center brackets are just 2 U-shaped hoops 
which you can probably
find at a dismantler, Automotion or maybe even a hardware store.

 Email me if interested.    Not sure on price, open to reasonable 
offer.  Shipping not included
from Easton, PA.
