Hi Pfans,

Thanks to everybody about help with the 3,6l engine converion =

in an older 911. Engine is from a -92 car. Original Motronic
and air-flow sensor is not used, instead a DTA eng.management
system that use throttle valve position sensor. =


Now the engine is running, throttle response is amazing with
the lightweight flywheel, but several things still unclear:

1. Ignition pulse.
    How many degrees before TDC comes the ignition pulse,
    e.g. how many degrees before TDC is the reference mark?
    =

2. Engine temperature sensor.
    The DTA eng.management system has an input for cooling =

    water temperature. =

    Should this sense now the cylinder head temperature? =


3. Cylinder head temperature.
    What temperature range is the cylinder head when driving
    hard?
    - What would be ideal temperature?
    - What is "too damn hot?

4. Air pressure sensor (boost sensor) in DTA box.
    There is an input for boost pressure, this is a non turbo
    engine. Should this be connected to sense the manifold
    pressure after throttle valve? Or should it just sense the
    atmospheric pressure, e.g. left open?
    This system do not have a "barn door" air-flow sensor,
    it has throttle valve position sensor. =

    If connected to sense the manifold pressure, the DTA =

    would better sense engine load, right?

I understand that it is very difficult to answer to such questions
without having the whole picture in front, but any information
is highly appreciated.
If You need clarification to any questions, please E-mail me.

I have not been able to re-subscribe to the list, so I retrieve them
from home page, please reply directly to me also.

TIA
