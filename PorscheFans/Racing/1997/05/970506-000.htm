    James:

    You mean, aside from cost?

    Motorcycle helmets carry Snell "Mxx" ratings, where "xx" is the
    year of the Snell Foundation specs to which they conform; auto
    racing helmets carry "SAxx" ratings ("SA" stands for "Special
    Applications", by the way).

    The Snell specs are updated every 5 years, so the newest helmets
    carry "SA95" or "M95" ratings.

    SA helmets must have a Nomex liner and are, therefore, more
    fire-resistant than M helmets.

    In order to get the Snell rating, both types of helmets must pass
    a series of identical impact tests.  In addition, the SA helmets
    must pass a test designed to simulate impact with a rollbar.

    Also, SA helmets aren't allowed to have eyeports as wide as M
    helmets.

    Some manufacturers include aerodynamic features on their SA
    helmets that wouldn't make sense to put on an M helmet, and many
    SA helmets are availanle with provisions for forced-air cooling
    or emergency air supplies that are inappropriate or unnecessary
    for M helmets.

    Manufacturing costs being what they are, most manufacturers build
    their SA and M helmets identically (with the exception of the
    inner liner), so it's possible that a particular M helmet might
    meet the SA impact tests.  You can't RELY on this being true,
    however, and if your sanctioning body requires an SA helmet,  
    you'll need to have one.

> where is a good place to buy a car helmet

    Pegasus Racing and Racer Wholesale are two mail-order companies
    that stock a large selection of helmets, but you really need to
    try a bunch of them on to find one that fits your particular
    head.  Here in Southern California, there are a whole BUNCH of
    race-supply shops, but since I don't know where you live, I
    can't recommend one in your area.

    I can, however, give you some tips on choosing a helmet.

    First, you don't need to spend more than three or four hundred
    dollars or so.  A lot of helmets are more expensive than that,
    but in general, their features are unnecessary.  For example, you
    don't need to buy the $850 Bell Feuling SS; it's expensive only
    because its aerodynamic design is specific to Indy-Car cockpits. 
    Similarly, you don't need to buy a megabucks Stand 21 helmet;
    they're extraordinarily light, but you're not going to be pulling
    3Gs in your 928, so you don't need to spend those outrageous
    prices for every last ounce of weight savings. 

    Light weight, within reason, IS sorta nice, though... So if you
    can afford it, pay a few extra dollars for a kevlar helmet rather
    than a fiberglass one.  My helmet's a kevlar Bell AFX-1 Pro; it
    cost about a hundred dollars more than a more-or-less equivalent
    fiberglass helmet.

    Personally, I wouldn't even consider buying a helmet made by
    anyone other than Bell or Simpson.  I'm sure many people would
    disagree; this is just my personal opinion.

    Ok... Properly sizing a helmet:

    The salespeople at the shops should be able to give you some
    advice, but the important thing to remember is that there should
    be ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that you can remove a buckled helmet by
    reaching behind your head and pulling the thing forward.  If you
    can remove the helmet this way, it's too big and NOT SAFE.

    POC members, of course, don't need to worry about buying helmets
    too big for their heads... It's a physical impossibility.

    Anyway, when in doubt, go with the smaller helmet size.

    Sizes vary from manufacturer to manufacturer (and model to
    model), so make sure that you find your size by trying on the
    specific model that you want.  After you put the helmet on,
    buckle it and make sure you can't pull it off your head.  Then
    grab it and rotate it left and right; if it rotates freely
    without deforming your face, it's too loose.

    Next, let go of the helmet and just shake your head back and
    forth.  If, after a few shakes, the helmet doesn't return to its
    original position (that is, if you have to reach up and
    re-center it in order to see out the eyeport again), it's too
    loose.  You should also try nodding your head forward and back.

    Finally, leave the helmet on (with the visor up, if you like)
    for about half an hour and see if it gives you a headache.  If
    it does, it may be too tight.

    Also, if you wear glasses under your helmet, make sure that you
    can put them on through the visor... Some helmets (like my Bell
    AFX-1) have pretty small eyeports, so this can be difficult. You
    may want to check this even if you have perfect vision, in case 
    you ever want to wear sunglasses under the helmet.

    One more thing... Once you find a helmet that you think you
    like, get in your car while wearing it and make sure that the
    eyeport's positioned/sized appropriately so that you can see your
    instruments.  You do NOT want to have to crane your neck downward
    to see your tach or your oil-pressure light.

    More stuff:

    1.  If you buy an extra visor (maybe a dark tinted one), spend an
    extra ten bucks and get the Bell pivot-screw hex wrench and
    "pivot kit" (two pivot screws, two washers, and a lock-down
    button)... The Bell wrench (actually just a little "key") won't
    let you accidentally strip out the threads, and you'll want the
    extra screws and washers in case you lose or break one changing
    visors.

    2.  Helmet bags are nice, but a little expensive for what they
    are... See if the shop will throw one in with a helmet purchase.

    3.  Even with built-in vents, etc., most helmets will fog up.
    I've always just used the Rain-X anti-fog products (or a little
    soapy water in a pinch), but a few months ago, I discovered
    something called the Fog City Fog Shield.  It's just a clear film
    that you stick on the inside of the visor, and it's absolute
    MAGIC... It keeps the visor fog-free, with no re-application or
    special maintenance required.

    4.  Even though they're hot and a bit uncomfortable, think about
    buying a balaclava (those Nomex "head socks" or "hoods").  Aside
    from the extra fire-protection it gives you (about which you may
    or may not care), it'll keep the inside of your helmet from
    smelling like a locker-room, and from soaking up whatever greasy
    kid stuff you put in your hair. Depending upon the series in
    which you plan to be competing, you may be required to wear a
    hood anyway.

> who can do a good custom paint job for not to much money on a

    Herm Johnson, at Just Herm Designs (715 835-6026) charges a flat
    $275 to do a helmet, no matter how complex the design is.

    Troy Lee Designs' prices start at around $300 and go WAY up from
    there, but he also sells decal kits that you can install and
    clearcoat yourself.  Decal kits are around $30; you can reach
    Troy Lee at 909 371-5219.

    Larry Ferguson, at The Art of Racing here in the San Diego area
    (619 744-8623), will do a basic design for around $300. 

    You can also paint your helmet yourself; if you buy a decal kit
    from Troy Lee, you can paint one or two basic colors, then apply
    the decals, then clearcoat the thing and end up with a real
    nice-looking helmet for very little money. 

    If you paint the helmet yourself, make sure that you do two
    things:

    1.  Before painting, clean the helmet with one of the commercial
    wax/grease removers (avaiulable at your local automotive-paint
    supply store), then sand the helmet's surface (and, of course, 
    clean it again after sanding).

    2.  Use acrylic enamels, NOT lacquers; lacquers can damage the
    helmet shell. 

    Hope this helps...
