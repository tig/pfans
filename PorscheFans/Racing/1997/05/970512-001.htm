Hello, PorscheFans,

I have had an aggravating problem occur to my 944 three times.  Each time
it happened when I had driven my car hard -- twice after driving it for a
day or two on the track, and once after a skiing weekend at high altitude
at Lake Tahoe while driving it back.  I'm just really glad it hasn't
happened on the track yet!

Anyway, it has happened on a long hill/mountain each time. I admit it, it
is quite likely I was lugging it in 5th up the long steep hills after being
so tired and not paying attention to downshifting.  The car skips a beat,
hesitates,  loses power. As long as I don't accelerate, it acts fine. But
as soon as I press down on the gas, it skips and continues to lurch until I
back off.  It starts off just feeling as if my foot slipped on the
accelerator, and gradually worsens until I have to pull off the road.  The
first two times it happened I didn't try to turn it back on until the next
day, when it was fine.  Last weekend I pulled over and went back after
twenty minutes... it started up fine.

It _feels_ like a fuel problem to me--I had several Datsun Z's that would
get clogged fuel filters and have the same symptoms, and replacing (or even
wiggling) the fuel filter would cure it.  But I replaced my fuel filter,
and it's happened twice since then.  My next guess is to replace the fuel
pump.  But I hate to randomly replace parts, especially when they get
successively more expensive.

Does anybody have any suggestions, or has this happened to them?

TIA,

~karen
