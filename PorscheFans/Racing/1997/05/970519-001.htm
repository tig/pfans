I just got back from the Nevada Open Road Challenge in of all places,
Nevada!
The race is called the Silver State Classic Challenge - anyway - I'm
just dropping a note to let everyone know how the handful of Porsches
did against the 30% Corvette population.

Target Spd:    Model:    Variance from target:    Rank in class:
Driver/Navigator:

145                74 911s    +1.6082                        2nd
(Renato Vergara/Richard Seely)
145                87 944T   +1.6082                        3rd
(Bill Wilson M.D./David Wilson)
130                96 C4-5   +0.4280                        1st
(Timothy Lane)
130                80 911sc  +5.6676                        6th
(Ted Strnot/Al Lee)
125                79 911sc  +1.0539                        5th
(J.E. Martin)

I also have to mention - because my Porsche isnt ready for the race -
that I entered as Navigator in my Dads 86' Audi 5000 CS Turbo - we ran
the 110 mph class (the biggest class with 18 cars total) and received
3rd place for a -0.0651 variance from target (mph).
Unfortunately - because of a nasty accident involving a Mustang (no
fatalities I'm happy to say), 8 cars had to be stopped on the course,
and unfortunately because of that stop those 8 cars really didnt stand a
chance because the middle leg of the race was thrown out. One of those
cars was an 88' 928 S4 that was competing in the 150mph class. To let
you know how bad the middle leg being thrown out was - some of the
people we traveled up with in an 89 vette' had to be stopped - and their
time was so skewed as a direct result, they estimated they had completed
the race at a +6mph from their target! - But really they finished in 2nd
place in their class (140mph) with only a -0.3579.

Anyway - it was fun.
