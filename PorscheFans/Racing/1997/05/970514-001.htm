No way, John! This car is babied.  Always has been.  It's a pain always
parking in the farthest spot, etc. but since the previous owners obviously
always did, I have to keep up the tradition.

And I always use the most expensive premium gas, but the first time this
happened, I was in the middle of nowhere and low on gas so had to fill up
with a no-name brand. This is why I suspected the gas, and replaced the
fuel filter the first time. Now I plan ahead better, and get gas in town.
;-)

But the other two times it has happened, the only similarity is lugging it
on long slow mountainous uphills after (lovingly) beating it all day on the
track.

Thanks for your collective thoughts on this matter...
