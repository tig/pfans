This is regarding Wes Shew's post about how to carry 4 wheels/tires without a
trailer. For years, I carried 4 wheels/tires, small toolbox, jack, helmet,
suit, camera bags, cooler and suitcase (no passenger) inside my 944. But then
I came across this little trailer (later stolen), had a hitch installed by
U-Haul and, of course, the amount of equipment I took to track events then
grew to fit the available space. I learned that 8-ply tires would handle the
speeds just fine (carry a spare, anyway) and I never have had a bearing
problem. The flimsy axle did suffer from the pounding from the frost heaves
on I-20 between Ft. Worth and Atlanta. I still use a trailer, a self
assembled 4'x8' with two storage boxes and room for 8 to 10 wheels, depending
on size. But for my peace of mind, whenever I have a chance to trailer my car
to a Club race, I'll do that. Good luck.
