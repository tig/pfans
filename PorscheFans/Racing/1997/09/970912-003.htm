<<I'm still in disbelief of the "Big sponsorship" statement.  Most
decals seen on cars represent small discounts, if anything at all. 
Please tell me of the many racer's that have "Big Sponsorship".  Tell me
ONE!>>

How about the the OG Racing car that won at Pocono? 

Even after being warned by Barry Lenoble on what I was about to see, I
was in fair disbelief at the number of enclosed trailers and paid crews.
There were also a fair number of people such as Barry who drove their
car to the track and had friends as crew but I was expecting a lot more
of a grassroots environment... But that was why I came to check things
out before taking the plunge.

Rafael Llopiz, the winner of E Stock, came up through the drivers ed
ranks with me a couple of years ago. His 993 represents an investment of
well over $60K. The two 951Ss that finished in front of him at Road
Atlanta were disqualified for cheating.

<<For those who are aspiring club racers listening in, there is a lot of
fun, (and risk if you push youself and your car over YOUR limits), to be
had. The races within races are as exciting as running up front and you
can race within your comfort zone.  It's up to you.  But Comradery is
what it is all about!!>>

This is what I am looking for. I was very impressed that a lot of
metal-to-metal contact results in the damage being paid for by the
hitter. You won't see much of that in SCCA club racing.

When I started looking into PCA club racing I was told that there were
typically 3 bent cars per event with *no* serious injuries. I thought
this level of risk for my street/track car was acceptable. It sounded
like advanced drivers ed with no passing signals. <g> But the recent
events seem to indicate that the level of risk is much higher. 

I am sorry if my need to get a handle on actual risks or joining in a
discussion of passing under yellow is so distressing to you.

<<Hold any one's comments "in high esteem". You guys need to get a grip
and please stay out of the paddock.  We certainly don't need anymore
whiners than we already have.>>

Doesn't the first statement directly contradict the other two??? You
appear to feel the need to flame people because their opinions are
different than yours. Try some decaffeinated for a change...
