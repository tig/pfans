Hi Barry:

I have been reading On Track as a subscriber for many years and it is without
a doubt my favorite racing magazine. It is a pure racing publication unlike
Racer which tries to be hip and over produced. Autoweek, Pano and Excellence
are great car mags and Grass Roots is an okay racing newspaper but On Track
is clearly superior for pure pro racing with lots of great coverage and
inside scoops without over blown production.

Get it - I know you will be pleased,
Ross

<< Hello,
  I recently received a brochure describing On Track magazine.  Of course,
the brochure makes it sound really great.   I currently read Autoweek, Grass
Roots Motorsports,
 Panorama, and Excellence.  Does anyone get On Track, and have any comments
about it?  I'm looking for more in depth race coverage than Autoweek,
 and more timely info than GRM. 
 Thanks,
 Barry Lenoble
