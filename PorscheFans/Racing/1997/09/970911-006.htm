I'd like to know where you get your information Scott. If the SCCA had
that many fatalities, they wouldn't be racing anymore. Yes there are
most likely more injuries in the SCCA than in PCAR, but you have to look
at the numbers. There are a great many more people drivng in SCCA events
than in PCAR events. A whole lot more. I read SportsCar every month, and
over the couse of one year so far I only recall mention maybe two or
three serious injury accidents, one resulting in fatality. That is by
far fewer than 'several'. And keep in mind again that the SCCA probably
has far more events and drivers than PCA and PCAR combined. Am I gainst
PCA events and the like? No, not at all, I think they're great, but the
more drivers you get, the more likely incidents will occur.
