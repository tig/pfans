I agree with your safety points. Full cages should be mandatory, without
question. This is real racing and anyone who saw Mike Keller's car should
have a full cage by now. 

As for the passing under yellow I can shed some light on the problem.
Normally I would be running in that race but I recently sold my E stock 944
Turbo because the racing is getting far too serious not to mention expensive,
anyway...
As a result I was working in the timing and scoring tower at Pocono. Scoring
was aware of all passes under yellow, thanks to the help of the corner
workers. We had revised the scoring so that anyone who passed under yellow
was penalized. We were explicitly told by the National Steward, Monty Smith,
to publish the original standings, as the race finished. The reason that no
one was penalized was that almost half the field would have been affected. I
don't necessarily agree with the decision but the circumstances were unusual.
The scary part is that a bunch of mostly experienced racers, going at extreme
speeds, don't know the rules or chose to ignore them.

Regards, 
Jerry
