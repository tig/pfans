Hi again,

Well, I got curious and call the Transportion Committee about SB42.

Yesterday, the bill past the appropriations committee with this
amendment:  For a period of five years, cars '73 and older would be
exempt.  After five years, it would switch to a rolling 30 year old
requirement.  Seems sort of silly, since it would actually be seven
years before '74 model year cars would be exempt, but that's the only
way they would pass it.

In the next step, it goes back to the full assembly for passage.
IMPORTANT!  Call or email your assembly person and let them know you
support this bill!  It's expected to pass, but the more yes votes the
better it will look to the governor.

Next, back to the Senate for an easy passage with the amendments.

Next, to Gov. Wilson.  Several of his departments, including Air
Resources Board, are in opposition to this bill, and are encouraging him
to veto it.  I couldn't get a feel for what he's expected to do here,
but if you email or phone his office and let him know how important it
is that he sign off on it, chances will be better.

It was emphasized that NOW is the time to become verbal about this.  If
you haven't contacted your state representatives, this is the time!

This indirectly affects those of you in other states, as your state is
probably watching this to see what happens.  

Regards,

Bob Brewer
