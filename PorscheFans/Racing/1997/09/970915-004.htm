Guys,

Fun times in the desert!  The Los Angeles Region did a great job this year
and there were over sixty-five cars zooming around this extremely fast 2.5
miles track.  Those of you who have attended this race the past couple of
years were sure to notice that there were some big changes.  The Event
Chairs, Dave Altemus and Fred Stewart, made sure that this year we had an
organized event and Jan Altemus, Registrar, spent most of her life the last
couple of months, ensuring that confirmation letters went out, packets were
prepared, etc.  Hopefully, everyone in attendance took time to thank these
people for their efforts.

High Desert Flaggers provided corner workers and grid people and did an
excellent job.  Timing and Scoring was a thousand times better than last year
(when we got final results for the races on the Wednesday following the
event) and if they improve another thousand percent, they might just be worth
bringing back.  We did get times, and usually within twenty-five minutes
after the sessions, but unfortunately, ofttimes they didn't make any sense.
 A couple of guys were surprised to find that they had turned times six or
seven seconds faster than they thought their car could muster and others were
just as surprised to find that they could have run around the track faster
than they were driving.  Excuse the soap box here, but I really believe that
National has to do something about T/S at our events. There is no reason we
could not have a National Timing system with transponders, national timers,
etc.  It might mean paying $50/year for our racing licenses instead of $30
for a couple of years, but it would solve one of our big structural problems.
 Further, having times that are much faster than reality may be an ego boost
but it's also scary to know that you've got guys behind you that are much
faster when you are in a racing grid.  If you have any thoughts on this (for
or against), you might let Alan know.

However, one of the nice things about this weekend was driver attitudes.  I
spoke to guys on the grid who had been given faulty times and instead of
ranting, raving and gnashing of teeth, they were talking to fellow
competitors in front and behind them.  Anytime anyone screwed up and I went
to talk to them, the attitude was one of cooperation and an agreement that
they had to do better.  The whole weekend I observed but four examples of
overdriving and, after a heart to heart, in each case they settled down.  I
got the feeling that everyone had a good time but I know that the steward had
a very enjoyable weekend!

Tom Charlesworth was the National Scrutineer and he did a fairly intensive
tech after qualifying.  He did find a couple of nitty gritty situations that
have to be fixed, but most of the problems were with weight and, as a result,
we gridded light cars to the back of their classes.  Still, a couple of POC
guys have prepared their cars for that club's rules and they know that
anytime they are weighed in PCA they are going to be light.  Guess what -
they are there to have fun and if they get disqualified, it's no big deal.
 They are there to have fun (!) and that's what it's all about.

We had one 13/13 incident in Turn One and the existence of a video made
making the call a piece of cake.  This was not the result of overdriving but
a simple driver error and the damage to the cars was slight.

In that we did not completely trust T/S and did not want to wait a week for
results, we had four people in the tower doing lap charts.  According to
those charts, the follow people managed to cross the finish line in front of
the other competitors in their respective classes:

GT1S - Robert Dalrymple (CA)
GT2R - Tom Peterson (CA)
GT2S - Steve Russakov (CA)
GT3R - Rick Polk (MN)
GT3S - Doug Barron (CA)
GT4R - Phil Magestro (CA)
GT5R - Allen Johnson (CO)
GT5S - Ron Ridgley (CO)
C - Steve Valazques (CA)
D - Carl Feghali (CO)
E - Martin Jansen (CA)
F - Tony Morrelli (CA)
G - Robert Zachowski (CA)
H - Tim Wou (Canada)
I - Ted Smith (CA)

Who were the winners at the event?  I didn't speak to anyone who felt they had
 lost!

Monte
