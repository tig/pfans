This is my first email since I just joined the list. I hope this gets
through all right.

There was a previous question about carrying an extra set of tires on a
911. I made a roof rack using Thule bicycle rack parts. They have two
different height uprights that mount to the drip rails. Using the short
ones in the front and taller ones on the rear it makes a perfectly level
platform across the crossbars which I cut to fit the width of the
"basket". To the crossbars I mounted a standard "basket" option that is
50" x 50". I screwed this whole assembly together into a single unit
rather than just using the standard mounting hardware for the "basket".
A set of wheels and tires fits perfectly in the "basket" needing only
bungee cords to make sure they stay on.

As you might guess handling characteristics and wind resistance change
but it doesn't slow me down at all on the long hauls to Thunderhill or
Buttonwillow. If you would like to see this setup just drop into any GGR
Time Trial and look for a red car number 37 with yellow wheels.
