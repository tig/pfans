Well it really all depends on what class you run in. Some PCA classes
don't allow DOT race tires, some allow DOT race tires but not slicks,
and some allow anything. I'm going to assume it's in a class that allows
DOT race tires.

A decent size would be 225 and 245 respectivly. You could probably fit
255s on the rear wheels, but will start pincing the sidewalls, and If
you can get a 245 solidly on a 9" rim, I think that's better than
pinching a wider tire onto the same rim. 

As for pressures, that all depends on the tire and your car setup.
Hoosiers generally require pretty high tire pressures for heavier cars.
BFGs have proven to be a great tire and can really help on cars that
can't get much negative camber through regular adjustment. The Kumho is
starting to show itself as a tire comparable to the R1 with a little
longer tread life. THen there's the rest, Toyo, Yokohama and others.
They're good DOT tires but not on par with the above. Pressures should
be set with tire temps, ESPECIALLY with Hoosiers and R1s. I hope someone
out there who has experience with those size tires on that type of car
can make a recomendation.
