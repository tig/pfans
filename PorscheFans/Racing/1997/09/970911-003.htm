HooraHHHH!

Thats a hell of a flame, to bad it is grounded in a good amount of truth.

Sure, PCA racing has some things I disagree with (no mandatory cage, very
short races, the 3% tire rule to name a few)
But then so does SCCA and Midwest council, Two venues I have run in for years.

So what! In general the rules are good, they are obeyed and they are evenly
administered. If people don't like something, they should address letters
and comments to the powers that be, not bitch and moan.

As to the "sponsorship" I assume you are refering to Kelly Moss, Racers
group, Johnson Motorsports, The Hish racing group, etc. Let me be the first
to inform you that they don't sponsor ANYBODY. They are paid by the
cometitors that use them, and in general they work their asses off.

Any sponsorship is generally provided by the racers themselves, or their
companies. I know mine is. (Tro manufacturing - Plug<G>)

Sure there is a LOT of money. I drive an 8-valve NA 944 in class H, and it
sometimes gets to me that there are drivers running $100,000 cars that can't
drive half as well as I can... Again, so what! It's their money!

"Life threatening incidents" are a bad thing, but in all the years of PCA
racing, there have been no fatalities that I am aware of. In SCCA several
people are killed or seriously injured every year. Since there are almmost
as many licensed drivers in PCA as in SCCA, i thing it speaks VERY well for
the overall safety of PCAR.

None of this is aimed at Robert, his is just the message I tacked on to.

I'm in my SF5 suit, so flame away.

Also, and earlier post taled about yellow to the next clear flag station in
SCCA. that isn't necessarily true. It is yellow until past the incident OR
the next flag station that is green.

I do agree that PCAR need to come out with a 1 page rules addendum that
SPECIFICALLY spells out yellow, black and red flag rules, and states that
they will be applied to every race, at every track, exactly as written. Then
i can safely shhot the next idiot at a drivers meeting who asks "when can I
pass under yellow". <G>
