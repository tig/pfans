Dear PCA Rulemkers,

It would be really helpful for those of us not steeped in RCA Racing 
Rules, and who are considering entering the fray, if you would post not 
only the proposed rule changes; but also the existing rules themselves.

I requested a copy of the rules from PCA HQ some time ago. but have 
rec'd. nothing, either by mail or E-Mail.

Since I am currently building my car, it would be helpful to know which 
hoops to jump through as I go along.  The impression (of a racing newbie) 
is that those inside are trying to keep the rules secret from those on 
the outside...I'm sure this isn't what you're trying to cconvey.

Regards,

Chip Evaul
70 911 RaceCar (GT2?3?4?)
