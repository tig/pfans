Fans,

My recent post about trouble getting club racing rules has sparked some
lively discussion, and at least one offer to post them online (thanks
GGR)...this is a healthy thing.

We have to remember that in terms of participation, abundant information
and encouragement will keep fringe operators (like myself and SO,
looking at the sport to maybe get started) moving in.

Based on a private E-Mail from Christie Boeder, I think I know where I
went wrong in the information-gathering process...requested the
information online through the PCA website, rather than calling Ruth
Harte directly. I will rectify this post haste.

I find it a little hard to believe that PCA will only mail the rules out
to those who have applied for a license, or intend to (as evidenced by
calling Ruth to say so).  This effectively eliminates anyone who doesn't
know whether they'd like to apply for a license without first knowing
the rules; which, when you're talking about car racing, is a prudent
approach. And which probably includes a lot of people.

I would volunteer to use my FREE 2 MB Earthlink website to post the PCA
Club Racing Rules.  From the collective comments from those who have
them, they are apparently pretty simple and it wouldn't take long with a
Word/Word Perfect/Pagemaker disk from PCA - probably a week or less,
working at night.  Having this resource on the web would be a HUGE
marketing tool: A) Porschefans who race, or are planning to and are
regularly asking about rules interpretations would have another research
tool; B) PCA racing candidates from previous Drivers Ed/AutoX/Time
Trials would be better informed about more factors, before making the
plunge (or at least saying they intend to)...not the least of which is
preparation costs.

Last weekend Lise and I went out to the Willow Springs race to take in
the scene and see if this is something we want to get into.  We met
several others doing exactly the same reconnaissance. There seems to be
enough interest to keep growing the PCA sport for some time to come.  I
imagine this is similar to almost every venue over the past year.  BTW,
the racers - to a person - were cordial, helpful and almost always more
interested in the car we are building than the one they were racing...a
nice group.

The Porsche "quasi-pro" teams evident at Willow Springs didn't put us
off in the slightest.  Ted Smith said it exactly right: their presence
is gratifying, evidence that the series has moved in the right direction
(to date), and ultimately provide a support network for the mom/pop
teams. Wished I'd have had $600 for Hoosiers with me; could have saved
shipping!

Anyway, c'mon all you Porschefans racers...let's get the rules online. 
Think of all the new flames we'd have at our disposal.
