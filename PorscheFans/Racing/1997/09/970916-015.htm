Dear Barry:

My posting was not intended to address every system. Several postings I have
read recently were for CIS 2.7 and 3.0 motors without the 1980's + O2 sensors
-- which by the way don't care anything about performance enhancement
considering they are calibrated to reduce emissions not increase torque and
horsepower. We disconnect them for your information on some of our race cars
because the leaded fuel fouls them. Also, very few racers are running motors
with the latest knock detection capabilities and I don't remember seeing such
devices on any of the 3.8RSR motors.  

Finally, the computer runs off the programmed mapping - if you don't remap to
take advantage of the entire system design (including all the various
component changes) you haven't optimized the system.  The factory mapping and
sensors are always a compromise of fuel economy, emissions control and
performance.
