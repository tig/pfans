Perhaps it was because Jerry personally atacked Monty and his decision
making process.

As to contributed time, everyone who helps at any event should be
appriciated, thanked and listened to, but it is and always will be the Chief
Stewards decision and responsibility to  decide what happens. It is not the
place of anyone else to assume that responsibility unilaterally.

P.S. I'll buy beer or soda or coffee etc. for anyone i meet who helps run
the races I drive in, and I think Monte would as well.
