Um - Nice try but no cigar!  Your engine is the same 2.4 liters that it was
born with in Stuttgart!  When Porsche changed the production 911 engine from
2.2 to 2.4 liters in 1972, they did so by lengthening the stroke of the 
crankshaft from 66 mm to 70.4 mm.  The pistons and cylinders kept the same
bore, at 84 mm.  This is why you can retrofit the earlier, higher compression
pistons to your engine.  So your car belongs in GT4, because you have a 
modified 2.4 liter engine.  It is your misfortune that the class rules were
written up to 2.8 liters.  If you want to be competitive, you'll have to
upgrade to 2.7 liters.  You may be able to do this (90 mm pistons and cylinders)
but it involves considerable work on the engine.
 
You should get Bruce Anderson's book on 911's.  It's full of useful information
like this.
