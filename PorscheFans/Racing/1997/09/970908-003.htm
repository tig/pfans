  There are requirements for the control arms of the 944.

Cal and I are both in the Northeast Region of PCA.  I first heard of =
this problem 3 or 4 years ago at a tech session sponsored by one of the =

I don't mean to speak for you, but I saw no reply to the list so I =

Jerry Pellegrino owns the shop.  He told us that on older cars they hard =

This first showed itself when they found they couldn't get the camber =

Jerry has a jig that they use to bend the spindle back, and then they =
weld in the gussets that Cal mentioned.
Last year a NER member hit a wall at Pocono in his 930 when his strut =
failed.  I saw it in the body shop later that year, and it looked like =
the weld failed where the spindle joins the strut.
Jerry has aligned my car, and didn't mention that he saw this problem.  =
I've told myself that I will have the gussets added if I do more track =
events (only 2 last year, none this year due to mechanical problems), =
and especially if I start running track tires.
Hope someone finds this helpful.
