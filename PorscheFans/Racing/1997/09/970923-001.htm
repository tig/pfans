Hi Paul, I think it was your car that I saw had 4 tires/wheels mounted
above the rear bumper? Questions:

How does this setup work?

Is it available retail or custom or DIY?

Approx. cost?

Where are the mounting points to the car? The tires don't touch the car,
right?

Does it block the view of the taillights or license plate?

I like the idea of not worrying about tire trailer bearing/tire failure at
speed on the highway. And storage space for a tire trailer. What are the
drawbacks of your setup? Can the wheels be locked to the mount?

Anyone else with other ideas, besides carrying on a roof rack setup? What 
have you seen at the Nationals race in Topeka? How about just shipping
them UPS to a local at the event?
I saw
a JC Whitney catalog with a rear metal platform that attaches to a std.
trailer hitch receiver. Says it can support 500 lbs. It looks like you can
stack 2 tires/wheels side by side 2 high. But I think it would block the
lic. plate and tail-lights. TIA
