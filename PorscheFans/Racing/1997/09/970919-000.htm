I would add that you MUST replace the stock alloy control arms with 
steel arms of some type, either FABCAR or your own strengthened early 
944 steel arms (the ones from the Volkswagen Rabbit).  The PCA Racing 
rules will NOT allow you to lower the car unless this change has been 
made.  If you don't lower the car - you won't go very fast!  You CAN 
replace the rear shocks on a 1986 951 with coil over units and remain 
in stock, this was a factory option that is allowed to be added to 
your car.  Just don't remove the torsion bars already in the rear, you 
can augment them, but not replace them entirely.  Of course, if they 
happen to be replaced with a broken set from an early 924 they 
probably won't have much effect....

Don't bother to make any of the "prepared" modifications, you won't be 
competitive in Class E.  Stick with class F where you have a chance 
for more fun and a better result.

Incidentally I bet you will have quite a bit more money in your 86 951 
when it is done (running up front) than I sold my "ready to go" killer 
car for!

Have Fun -
