OK, I give up trying to figure out the following problem. Any
suggestions would be welcome.
At both Lime Rock several weeks ago and yesterday, at NHIS, my car
sputters and stutters under HARD left turns.  Its not noticeable driving
to Track Events and at Watkins Glen (mostly Right handers) the problem
doesn't arise.

In trying to resolve the problem, I changed out the following - fuel
filter, eng. head temp sensor, readjusted air/fuel mix, new ignition
wires, etc. since the problem started.  The car is a '70 911 with an '88
3.2.  The tank is from an 84, with the 70 fuel delivery system (except
the pump, which is new).  The car acts like its fuel starved under the
left turns and my thoughts are the tank pick-up or perhaps the venting
system.

Anyone else had this problem?  Do I need a pre-pump or change the pick
up in the tank?  Any thoughts, or suggestions would be great..

Thanks In Advance,

John Dunkle
