It does, and from other people's comments any my own experience, it does
seem a bit more reliable than other years, but there's a rather small
window of usefulness.  For either reading to be correct, you have to be
at the right temperature.  If you're significantly off from that (and
I've found 30 degrees to be quite significant), you can't really trust
either measurement, but you get more information from the dipstick (how
far you are above the top fill mark) than you get from a gauge that's
pegged at the top.  I do agree that the gauge is convenient at times, but
when racing and seeing temperatures get above 250, I'd rather trust the
dipstick so I can tell how far over full I am at a given temperature.
