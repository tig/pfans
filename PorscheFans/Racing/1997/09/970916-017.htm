Harry Hall - I don't know if you read the Racing list, so I sent this to you
and posted it.

Could you explain to the Porschefans Racing list a few things about the
intent of the proposers of some of the Club Race rules changes under
consideration.  As rules committee chairman for Rocky Mountain/Alpine
Mountain for our local driver's ed/autocross series of friendly competition
between regions, and as a writer of rules by profession, I know that it is
very hard to express exactly what is intended, no more and no less,
even when you think you know what you want the rule to be.  I am going
to comment substantively on some of the proposals eventually, but first
need to understand a bit more.

1) Minimum weights for GT:  Are these with or without driver?  I assume
without because that's the way the stock classes are set up, but would
like to confirm this assumption.

2.(2) a. - Porsche tub from shock tower to shock tower.  If I chop the A
pillar off a 911 Targa or 914, and the Targa/914 equivalent Targa bar
(functionally replaced with roll cage, naturally), have I violated the "tub"
rule?  What if I do this with a coupe?  I guess the question is, does the
"tub" always extend above the dash/doors.

If I remove the rear seat/shelf sheet metal, none of which is structural
(and replace it with enclosing panels in other locations as a firewall),
have I violated the tub rule?

2.(2)b. - Porsche engine and tranny case required.  Isn't this exactly the
current rule on the books since race one (or at least rule book one)?

2.(2)c. - Suspension derived from underlying car.  This would prevent
converting McPherson strut or semi-trailing arm (on 911) to double A arm
(unless I guess in rear you replicated the 993 setup?)?  Would it allow
replacement of torsion bars with coilovers as at present is allowed?
Relocation of mounting points?  Replacement of the sort of "P" arm lower
front locating member on a 911 with the 935 style?  

2.(2)d. - spoilers within body envelope.  Leaving aside factory's clever
response to some rules like this  (extend body rearward to allow rear
wing to be moved farther back) if I correctly remember accounts of
factory triumphs past, would this ban some pretty ordinary spoilers at
rear?  The IROC tail extends beyond my rear bumper, as I found out
when I tied car down to far back in trailer and rubbed the rear edge of
the tail on the door.  935 style front ends come with a splitter rim on the
bottom, and it's the farthest forward part of the piece.  Neither of these is
a fancy wing.  Would they be banned (subject to paragraph 3 being
satisfied as an option, of course) under this proposal?

2.(3) - waiving some of the above for "historic" race cars:  is it intended
that the car, among other things, meet rule (2)b AND (2)c AND (2)d; or be
in original Porsche racing trim?  Or was it intended that these three
references be connected with ORs?  Does "original Porsche racing trim"
mean "meets all of the rules of the sanctioning body which allowed it to
race as a nominal Porsche applicable when it did race?"  So if one made
some modifications not allowed by that other sanctioning body at a time
when it actually raced in an event put on by that body, the car would not
fall under this exception even though the modifications would be allowed
under our club race scheme?  Also, if one built a car to the rules of that
other sanctioning body, but did not actually race it in such an event (e.g.,
built a Fabcar 935 in 1997, when those days are long gone and for the
sake of argument no other non-vintage body would recognize the car
currently as a Porsche and let it compete, etc., so it couldn't gain any
racing history), then this replicar (repliracer?) would not qualify for this
rule option, would it?

Did any sanctioning body ever accept a non-Porsche engined car as a
Porsche? (quibbles about 914-4s being VWs, 924s being Audis not
accepted here)  What about non-Porsche transmission cased car?

Also, old SCCA and IMSA rules may be hard to come by, though current
ones are pretty available.  Where might one even begin to look, though,
for the Porsche Cup points rules back over the years?  Yes, you might
ask a person to prove the car ran, but how to check eligibility now under
rules back then?

3.  If Rule 1 (minimum weights) is adopted, would Rule 3. (allowing
waterpumpers more than the current displacement in each GT class,
with the amount of extra cubic centimeters to be determined at a later
date) still be on the table as a possibility?

Humbly submitted in the spirit of civilized discourse.

Walt Fricke (whose ex-SCCA GT3 '68 912 Targa with 911 implant and
then later bodywork updates by yours truly may be discerned behind
some of these questions.  the first rule of rules examination psychology
is:  how does this affect me.  Olympian detatchment is very hard to come
by.)
