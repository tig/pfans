Part of me wants to weigh in on and cast my vote on one side of this debate 
then an other, but then I think NOW NOW CHILDREN.

From my experience of over twenty years at PCA events in three different 
regions, some 13 or 14 years at DE events and a handful of club races (I trust 
that will keep anyone from accusing me of not having adequate history  or 
involvement) by and large all of the folks involved are trying to make the 
event, whatever it is, safer and more fun.  There have been a number of 
personal affronts taken and as a result personal attacks.  When I read these 
postings, I am afraid I read inconsistencies within the same posting, between 
the history cited and the conclusion drawn.  Certainly there are different 
views between individuals.

Incidents such as Pocono are going to bring emotions to the fore as well as 
concerns and questions.  The point is what have we learned and what are we 
going to do as a result.  Some amount of fact finding is obviously required 
and peoples views are obviously different, given that we are human and given 
that by virtue of position at the event different people had different 
abilities to gather data.  I suggest no one has all the answers in spite of 
best efforts to gather all the information.  This is not an indictment, just 
my view of how the world works.

Now, I encourage us to continue the debate but with the tone of:
1) we are seeking the truth ( my 11th grade English teacher would suggest this 
is a lifelong quest ), 
2) we all want to see improvement in our lives and particularly club racing, 
and 
3) we are all upset to think that someone may be permanently injured or worse 
and it could happen again 

Looking forward to reading more about improving the program.  And waving a 
white flag, not because there is a slow moving vehicle.

Paul Margaritis
