Well, this was a great event!!! I sure appreciate the work the organizers
did 
to pull it off.  The facility is brand new and pretty impressive with
103,000 
seats and swamp cooled garages. The road course was well designed and well. =
 
It was really hot (100+) both days, and the collection of Air Force jets 
flying over all weekend from Nellis AFB added to the scenery. 
 
There were two race groups and I was in the red group, GT4S and lower GT 
classes and the stock classes.  We had 47 cars in the group and we got
pretty 
spread out after a few laps but the first 2 or 3 laps were most interesting.=
 
 
The start/finish line is on the banked oval and cars were running 4-5
abreast 
after starting.  The course then pinches down into a one lane (2 1/2 if you 
use the curbs)chicane.  It was tight getting thru there but then the track 
moves into a long sweeper and onto the oval again, terminating into a 2
lane, 
u-turn to the left.  You enter the braking zone at triple digit speeds, even=
 
in my I-stock 944. Going into that turn during the race was giving me
deja-vu 
flashes of stock car racing in my youth.....cars spinning, metal crunching, 
tires screeching under too-late braking as cars dove in the inside where
there 
was no more inside......but wait....this is PCA Club Racing.....what the
hell 
are these guys thinking?.......(more on this later) 
 
I think there were more cars running in GT1 and GT2 than in I stock(6).  I
was 
out in front with another black 944 in hot pursuit.  He qualified .4sec. 
faster than me but age and treachery and all that...kept me out in front,
plus 
I think he was a bit intimidated by the high speed congestion and paint 
swapping...... 
 
I held him off for a lap or two and he was black flagged for passing under 
yellow.  The pressure was off so I backed off to let the "faster" cars in 
other classes get by and watched my mirrors for any other competition but 
there wasn't anyone close so I paced myself at 2:08 laps instead of the
2:05's 
I'd been running. I will sometimes dice with cars in faster classes but if 
I've outqualified them they're running a different race and I don't want to 
hold them up if no ones threatening me.  After 9 laps I saw a 914 in my
class 
catching up, probably 3-4 sec. back so I picked up the pace for the last few=
 
laps as a bit of insurance.  All in all a pretty good time.  It'd be great
to 
see more 944s out......I stock is down on the food chain but it's a lot more=
 
fun to drive a relatively slow car fast than it is to drive a fast car 
slow.........think about this if you're contemplating club racing.....you
can 
get way outspent on a GT class car but the stock classes are generally
pretty 
competitive and lots of fun without the cubic dollar costs. 
 
Now, about all these incidents.........a friend who went to RoadAmerica the 
week before Vegas said he counted six cars that he thought were totalled 
there.  I sure saw some bonehead moves in Vegas that bent metal, one in 
particular where one car literally rammed another right next to me in the
turn 
4 mess.  The car that was hit was hit pretty hard and he didn't see who hit 
him, nor did the corner workers who were no doubt busy trying to sort out 
spins, ect.  I have only a split second picture in my mind of the front
fender 
of the smasher but I couldn't be sure who it was.  The smashee didn't hear 
from the smasher after the race, rather it was suspected that the smasher 
loader the car up and hit the road...and evaded the 13/13 penalty......this
is 
not cool.  Nor is it in the spirit of Club racing........Is this spirit 
changing?  Are we willing to put up with more bent metal?  I sure hope not. =
 
Sure, stuff happens on a track, and if you're not comfortable with the fact 
you may take your car home all balled up, perhaps you shouldn't be running
it. 
 But you do deserve a venue where you should be able to run with a modicum
of 
security about the attitude and perspective of your fellow racers.   
 
We'll see fewer people coming out to risk their cars if we can't provide a 
safer venue for them to run in.  I for one really enjoy these events and
would 
sure like to see them grow.  This won't happen if we can't clean these 
incidents up. 
 
So, next weekend is Willow Springs....drink plenty of water, get lots of
rest 
and, hey, take a look in the mirror and explain to yourself that you can't
win 
if you don't finish..........and it's not fair to put other people and their=
 
equipment at unnecessary risk because you brain fade.........drive within
your 
limits........... 
 
See you out there....
