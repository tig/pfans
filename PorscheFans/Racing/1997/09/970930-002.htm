Has anyone dealt with Aircooled Racing and Parts of Wellsville, PA  which
advertises in Pano?  In June, I sent some money as down payment for one
fibreglass doorskin for my 914.  I was told that it will take a few weeks.
Thus far, no word from this outfit.  The check was cashed and I have been
calling every other week and left messages on the answering machine.  I
even Faxed my inquiry.  Still not a word.  I have met the man who owns this
shop at the Ski Roundtop swap meet on many occasions and he appeared to be
honest and trust worthy.  Does anyone know what has happened to this
outfit?  It still advertises in  Pano.

I wanted to order some quarter panels, but will pass.  I need rear quarter
panels to fit wider tires.
