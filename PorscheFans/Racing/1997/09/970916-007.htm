Why does PCA Racing place such a high penality on the Quaiffe differential? I
read someone recently complaining of "cheaters in stock classes with
Quaiffes" and don't understand it. Having run both we didn't see any change
in lap time differences. Actually according to some drivers the stock LSD has
an advantage in coasting / deceleration mode for those who prefer the
"centering feel" as opposed to the Quaiffe's "free-wheeling". 

We have been using and recommending Quaiffes because they don't cost much
more than a new factory LSD and they don't wear out requiring rebuilds every
season or two.
Forcing an otherwise stock trans & motor competitor to run in modified just
because he has a Quaiffe is ridiculous and I would recommend widespread civil
disobedience on that one and not call it cheating at all. 

I hope there is enough agreement to get National to change the rules on
this...
