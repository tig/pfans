         Dear Mr. Clardy:
         
         	Thank you for your e-mail regarding SB 42.  Your support 
         is much appreciated.
         
         	SB 42 was approved by the State Senate today, 36-1.  
         Senator Tom Hayden was the one lone no vote.  Last week, the 
         Assembly Appropriations Committee adopted amendments to SB 42 
         which freeze the 25-year and older smog check exemption for five 
         years, at which time the exemption becomes a rolling, 30-year 
         exemption.  In other words, the bill moves the current 1965 
         exemption year cutoff forward to 1973 and maintains that 
         exemption year until 2003.  The amendments were promulgated by 
         the committee.  Obviously, I prefer the previous version of the 
         bill.  Notwithstanding the committee amendments, passage of the 
         bill represents a substantial victory.
         
         	Please continue to convey your worthy support to 
         Governor Pete Wilson and urge him to sign SB 42 into law. The 
         Governor's e-mail address is www.gov.ca.gov  
         You may leave a phone message at 916-445-2841.
         Or, you may FAX him at 916-445-4633. 
         
         					Sincerely yours,
         
         					QUENTIN L. KOPP

p.s. Just think when this passes you won't be hearing SB42 from me anymore
