Barry:

Road America was overall a very good time.  Around 200 race cars entered
and I think another 150 or so in DE groups.  The track is absolutely
gorgeous and that alone is worth the trip.

Not sure how many "official" incidents were reported, but I only saw 3 cars
with serious damage.  I don't beleive any required off-track treatment of
the driver (thankfully)

The show of hardware in the (reserved), upper paddock was amazing!  2-
962's, tons of full race 911 Turbos that would look right at home at PSC
(or whatever they're calling the former IMSA) races.
Transporters/motorhomes/trailers everywhere!  

I realize that putting on such a huge event is a tremendous undertaking and
I'm thankful that there are people willing to put forward the effort to run
such an event.  Thanks much to event chairs Arnie Zann and Margo Pinkerton
for their huge comittment.  Thanks also to the crew in T & S (hello to Lee
L.) for the speed at which they had results available!  The race program
was really nicely done too by Susan Shire.

Can't withhold the gripes though..... 

IMO, too many people driving over their heads.... seemed like half the
sessions were black flagged due to someone going off course (mostly safely
into a gravel trap).  

The announcer had an uncanny ability to turn positives into negatives.  I
suspect there is some political motivation for his assignment as I believe
he is the region president, but.... it became an ongoing joke throughout
the paddock by mid-day Sunday.

Entry fee for 3 days and 8 track session (including practice starts,
qualifying, and race) was $350.  I think DE was around $250.  Included a
very nice dinner at Seibkins and a nice T-shirt.  I know RA is very
expensive to rent, but I don't think the club racing program was intended
to become a cash cow for regions blessed with a big-name track.  Our event
at Brainerd broke even with a 3 day event, loads of track time, a great
dinner and drinks trackside, and a really nice embroidered long sleeve polo
shirt, for $300 race fee and $85 for DE.  Only about 150 cars total!  If
this sounds like an ad...good: COME TO BRAINERD NEXT YEAR!!!

Not sure if this is specific to this race or to the larger races in general
(it sure isn't at Brainerd!).  But it sure felt like the stock class cars
were secondary to the big rig, big money racers.  The GT1-2 race was
announced as the "Feature Race" of the event.  Scales were only available
to stock class racers for a short time on Sunday and not at all on Monday
until impound after the race.

I was lucky and overestimated the amount of fuel needed to make weight.  (I
run a lighter wheel/tire combination for qualifying and race than for
practice).  A good friend and competitor of mine was not.  He out qualified
me and (thanks to a G class 911 between us by a spun car in the carousel),
pulled out an insurmountable lead on the first lap.  The rest of my race
was boring other than passing a '94 911 Turbo on the outside of the
carousel!  

I finished 2nd in I to my friend, but his car scaled underweight.  They
later re-weighed and he just made weight, but he was disqualified anyway.
I guess I would want that if it was someone I didn't know.  So... an
unsatisfying class win, but fun.  I guess I can feel good about beating the
other 11 I cars.  And we will hopefully have a re-match at Topeka!

One last little tidbit if anyone is still reading:  The event is called
"TRAC" for "The Road America Challenge".  The trophy is inscribed "TRAK
'97"  (doh!!)

Would be interested in opinions of others... Scott S, Lee L. are you there?
