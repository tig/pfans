The actual message that Jerry posted is on my other system so I cannot
refresh my own memory or quote to you what he said verbatim, but I
certainly don't remember him mentioning Monte's name in his post or
personally attacking him, while the opposite was true.

I also don't remember Jerry mentioning anything about his assuming the
responsibility of the Chief Steward. I don't think the chain of command
goes directly from Chief Steward to T&S spotter. But people who sign up
for this role must become acclimated to the fact that there will always
be those who disagree with their decisions. As someone in a public
position of authority they must be willing to suffer "the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune..." I think Monte could have made the same
comments without directly attacking Jerry.

I think the real issue is that authority figures do not like open forums
such as this where anybody can express a view. It is inherently out of
their control. But by reacting to *perceived* personal attacks they only
make things worse. The bottom line is that the PCA club racing program
is going through growing pains. By taking the stance that everything is
fully under their control where the evidence is the opposite only makes
things worse. I am a digest subscriber to this list and Monte's message
was ironically directly behind a report of even more carnage at Road
America and Las Vegas.
