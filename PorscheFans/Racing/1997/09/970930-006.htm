First off, not knowing your driving style, or what spring or sway bar
rates you have. I'd say that you don't have enough negative camber in
front, and toe-in in the front is generally a very undesirable feature
for an autoxer. Especially a front engined one.

How far of a drive is it? If it's not that far, and the only real use
they see is competition driving, then street use is not going to wear
them out on the inside. Heavy braking will cause far more wear on the
inner edge of the fronts than a little bit of extra street use on -.9
degrees of camber.

That sounds like a more reasonable number for the front. If both bars
are adjustable, then I would change the settings for track and autox.
Ideally, I'l set the front bar a stiff as you can before inducing too
much understeer. In your case, for autox, I'd stiffen up the rear bar
some. Not a lot, or you'll start picking up the inside rear wheel. If
your rear is already pretty stiff, then you should soften up the front.
The basic rule of thumb is the stiffer end (fron or rear) will slip
first. So a stiffer front will more likely yield understeer and a
stiffer rear will more likely induce oversteer. 

You will need to determine exactly what adjustments are neccessary
though. Make incremental changes and leave it alone for a bit. One run
is generally not enough to determine if the adjustment is good or not. 

Good luck.
