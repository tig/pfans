     Phans:
     
     Has anyone ever put RSR-style fender flares on a 993? I have a 
     narrow-body PCA track car that needs to run wheels that are larger 
     than my current 8s and 10s. Porsche Motorsport sells the RSR Cup racer 
     with optional flares and sideskirts (but no mounting hardware) for a 
     typically ludicrous sum. There are carbon-fiber aftermarket knockoffs 
     available for a fifth of the factory kit price. These are designed to 
     accommodate the optional 9 1/2 and 11-in. GT-2 wheels. How big a deal 
     is this conversion? How much metal to you have to cut out of the rear 
     wheel-well area? I assume the front stays as is. Are 11s the max. rear 
     wheel size? Any advice appreciated before I start hacking away.
     
     BTW, anyone who wants my factory early-model Supercup sideskirts 
     (great kit, black PVC, genuine Motorsport part), let me know. This is 
     a great appearance item and is actually functional at the track as 
     well. In addition, I have numerous 993 components for sale (Ps & Cs, 
     etc.), see posting to 911 list. Thanks in advance...
