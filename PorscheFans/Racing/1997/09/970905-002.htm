The short version:

ME:

MONTE:
Because we have one incident that is tying up all of the emergency equipment
and we do not want to risk another (the biggest reason NOT to pass under
yellow).  You will note that as soon as we ascertained the severity of the
incident that we went black.

The long version:

I was at the race. The only notable incident was a 911 hitting the 
inside wall on the last corner, and spinning back across the track.
As I came on the scene, yellow flags frantically waving, debris on
the track, I watched a corner worker help push the car off the track
to a safe position. I observed the yellow, backed off the throttle
and drove around the incident. To the best of my knowledge, so did
everyone else. 

Pass that corner, continue racing. Back to that corner, yellow still
out, no problem. Get to next corner, see stationary flag at that
corner, then see them at ALL corners. I look for cars off track,
debris, or any signs of trouble and see nothing. At this point I'm
hounding a 944 turbo and trying to pass him. I see the stationary
yellow, note that there is nothing wrong with the course, and proceed
to pass the 944 turbo in the bowl (who tried to repass me in the chicane
but I defended my line) and then I was able to pass a 911 (also in the
bowl, who then tried to pass me at every other corner, but the checker
flew next time down the front straight).

When the race was over I spoke to the driver of the 944 turbo (Eric
Ravid), and we agreed that the race was great, we gave each other room,
etc. Then I check the standings, and I see the driver of the 911 I
passed (Mark Forrestor). We also talk about the race and he tells me
"You know you passed me under a yellow flag." At that point my jaw
dropped and all I could say was "You're right, I did, and I'm sorry." I
have no excuse except that this was my second race, and while I saw the
yellow and looked for problems with the track, when I saw none, I
continued to race. I can only guess that a large number of cars
continued to (wrongly) race.

The reason for the full course yellow was a very good one, and I know
that I was wrong to pass. If I had been DQ'ed I would have understood.
Of course, I'm glad that didn't happen.
