Chip Evaul writes to say he has had trouble getting a copy of the Club
Race Rules, and is justifiably mystified by discussion of proposed
changes to rules he can't get.  Anyone with no rules might call Ruth
Harte to see how to expedite this.  An alternative might be to post a
request with your address to see if someone with rules near you would
let you make a copy (they are not anywhere as long as SCCA GCRS). 
Maybe national has run out and doesn't want to reprint until next year's
rules changes have been decided upon?  Anyway, if you are
participating in PCA driver's education events to gain the required
experience for licensing, surely someone at those events is a Club Racer
and could lend you a copy to copy.   But you are right on in thinking you
absolutely have to have the rules before you can sensibly start
constructing a race car.

Your suggestion of having the rules "on line" is a great one, but would
require someone to volunteer a site and spend some time (unless they
exist on a disc somewhere already) typing them in.  The rules have some
illustrations as well, but I guess for the adept that might not be much of
an obstacle.  I'd love to see that, because my copy is in the race car
trailer, and I spout off based on memory much of the time.  Plus it would
save Ruth some time I suppose.  But I am not volunteering.  Computer
inept.

All licensed club racers got the rules changes under consideration in the
Club Race newsletter recently - it comes out 6 times per year.  Of
course, you (and others in your position who are on or read the Racing
list) didn't, because you haven't applied for a license yet (I suppose, and
that's because you don't have a car built yet - lots of us have been
there).   Maybe someone with a fax will volunteer to fax the proposal to
you - it's just one page.  I see that the newsletter editor, Michael Melton,
has an e-mail address:  meltdown@bu.edu.  Maybe he has his news
letter on disc and can zap you the proposed changes.  But they won't
make much sense without the rules.

While I am a mere racer, instead of a racer/administrator like Alan, Harry,
Monte, etc etc, I want to assure you that no one wants to keep anyone in
the dark about the rules (now about the gofasts I am dreaming up for
myself, that's something else).  SCCA's rules are easy to come by - you
just send money to their national headquarters, and their paid staff deals
with it.  Our club race rules are free, and I think I am correct that PCA has
one paid administrator:  Ruth Harte, and thank the Lord for her.  Plus the
Pano editor gets paid.  Maybe there is a part time secretary to help Ruth? 
Anyway, you get the point.   Club Racing is a part of PCA near and dear
to many of us, but it is only one part.  Keep at it, you'll get there.

Walt Fricke, GT4 (main rule:  porsche engine case in porsche chassis
with Porsche tranmission case, displacement no larger than 2.800 liters,
which is cleverly just under the displacement of the racing 2.8, which is
2.807.9 liters and thus has to run in GT3)
