	This is only my second year of racing. Eight races in total.  I can't think 
of something I'd rather be doing on my days off.  Its exciting and 
challenging.  Whether that's finishing well, or having a great " race within a 
race".  But the best part of PCA racing is the COMRADERY!!  Some of my best 
friends are the guys I only see at the track. And the stories in the paddock, 
dinners and great times etc. are not to be missed.	
	
	Cheating is not the norm in the E and F stock classes that I am most familar 
with. Yes, there are a few cars( a very few) with guestionable parts (most 
make little if any difference). If you can't beat you friends legally, what 
fun would that be?? If you are, it usually becomes obvious to the most 
experienced racers.  IMHO I think people find it easier to believe someone is 
cheating than to say he's a great driver, or that he has a better prepared car 
or probably both.  If you have only 50 or so days seat time, your not going to 
be able to hang with someone with 2,3, or more times the track time.  Unless 
of course, your the second coming of Senna.  Winning is obviously not 
everything, but being competitive makes it more fun.  If you show up with a 
completely "stock car", stock suspension, stock alignment etc., WHAT DO YOU 
EXPECT!  But give it up.NEVER!!  Your heart was'nt in it in the first place.  
Commercialied, Big business, drivers need to win...  We could not have been at 
the same race.  Please, don't mistake PCA racing for drivers ed.	
	
	Chris, I expect to see you at Lime Rock next spring. Otherwise one of the 
best driver's wont be there.  Hey, I still have yet to win one of these 
things,  and you will be missed.
