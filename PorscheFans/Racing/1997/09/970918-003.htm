Hi Bill

 Could someone who races a 951 in PCA Club racing please help me figure out

The rules are very simple. If the rules don't say you can do something,
then you can't. 

There are two classes, stock, and super (AKA GT). 

For the stock classes, you are not allowed very many mods:

1. Engine:
   No mods from air filter to exhaust manifold
   No chip changes
   No changes to injectors or anything like that.
   The AC Compressor must be there, but you can remove the belt
   You can add an oil cooler
   The exhaust system is free (provided you meet noise rules)

2. Suspension: (here it's not so stock)
   Shocks, spring rates, swaybars, are all free
   You can't change the spring type (ie you can't change from 
     torsion bar to coil over)
   Suspension pick up points must remain same

3. Wheels and Tires:
   You can increase wheel size 1" in width. 
   Tires must fit in wheel wells. You can roll the fender lip only

4. Brakes
   Stock calipers and rotors must be used.
   You can groove/slot/drill rotors
   Master clyinder must be stock
   Pad, fluid is free
   You can duct air, and remove backing plates

5. Transmission
   Gear ratios must be stock
   factory LSD allowed
   "Short Throw" OK
   coolers OK

6. Body/Chassis/Interiour
   Chassis/Body, other than bumpers and spoilers, must be the same
     material and configuration as stock
   Lexan winshield allowed
   Fuel cells allowed
   Control arms free (FABCAR or early steel OK)
   Seats, steering wheel, shift knob free
   Interior must be stock, except for mods for roll bar / cage

That's it for stock cars. If you make certain mods to a stock
car, you progress 1 class. For example, running 2" wider wheels,
a non stock DME chip, or slotted suspension points would move
a 951 from F to E. This is the 'prepared' class.

For the "Super" or "GT" classes, you can pretty much make any
change you like. Classes are determined by engine size, with a 
1.3 multiplier for turbo cars.
