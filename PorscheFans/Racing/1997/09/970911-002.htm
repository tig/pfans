	Racing is just that.  Racing!!  As I see it,  several list members have 
mostly negative comments that I percieve as petty whining.  Yes, there have 
been a few incidents lately here in the east.  LimeRock(Nick Ventura's crash) 
and Pocono(Michael Keller's) are presumably driver error, until proven 
otherwise.  This is going to happen in all levels of racing.  In PCA racing 
the are more novices than any other major race venue. They as a rule, compared 
to other venues, have very little seat time or race experience.  With any 
thought, you would have expected more than the usual amount of incidents. 
There are not rules or measures to keep participants from driving over their 
heads or with them.  For the most part. I think you will find that in PCA 
racing, many racers have skills that would rival those of the gentlemen racers 
of Sports Car, SCCA or other venues . 		
	
	There is merit to Paul's comments on mandating cages and other safety    
equipment.  However, these are already strongly recommend for all classes.  
Racing is, after all, at you own risk.  But,  if you cannot and are unable to 
risk your car or, more importantly yourself, then just continue to be a  
interested observer.	
	
	I'm still in disbelief of the "Big sponsorship" statement.  Most decals seen 
on cars represent small discounts, if anything at all.  Please tell me of the 
many racer's that have "Big Sponsorship".  Tell me ONE!  Many teams in 
Professional Sports Car Racing don't have sponsorship, except for themselves. 
From my perspective you guys are on the outside looking in.  I Personal Know 
the top ten competitors in my class, (F),at each venue and there is no" BIG 
SPONSORSHIP"!!
	
	For those who are aspiring club racers listening in, there is a lot of fun, 
(and risk if you push youself and your car over YOUR limits), to be had. The 
races within races are as exciting as running up front and you can race within 
your comfort zone.  It's up to you.  But Comradery is what it is all about!!
	
	I believe that Pocono was one of the best run races that I've attended.  
There were some much needed changes in place, such as gridding for practices 
and qualifying.  As far as the yellow flags... I would have perfered a double 
yellow or, better yet,  black lag the race if the incident is such a hazzard.  
It was to be a ten lap race, where qualifying is everything

	Hold any one's comments "in high esteem". You guys need to get a grip and 
please stay out of the paddock.  We certainly don't need anymore whiners than 
we already have.
