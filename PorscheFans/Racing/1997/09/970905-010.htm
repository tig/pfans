Having been a steward for Porsche Owner's Club Racing events I can imagine
what a mess a "mass ignoring of the yellow flags" can create.  Gladly I can
say this hasn't yet presented it's ugly head in any of the events I have
managed or participated in.  Not knowing Pocono or the circumstances I would
not pass judgement. However,  I do know how critical it is to be swift and
decisive when it comes to dealing with infractions and can only hope that the
PCA program makes this a priority.
 
 It is very disturbing to read and hear about the frequency of incidents and
reported infractions. This is supposed to gentleman racing and yet it has
more of the look (if not worse)  of TransAm, IMSA, etc.  How many pro-racing
series have a driver in serious condition in the hospital? Certainly this has
no place in our level of racing. 
 Prayers and God's blessings for a speedy recovery to Mike Keller!!
