Wow -

I guess I better get a major corporation to sign up quick, before they 
all get taken.   Hmmm, I wonder if Dupont Refinish has a car dedicated 
yet....

Bob Scotto is right in his last post.  Sponsorship is limited to the 
"owners company" decals, and any others are just decoration.  My 
sponsor is Drextec, Inc.  a provider of client/server database 
programming services (and a lousy sponsor they are too, they never 
have enough funds dedicated to the racing program...).

Whining isn't great, but constructive criticism is needed and should 
be welcomed in any forum like this.  I don't think that Jerry meant to 
attack Monty personally at all, it was just misinterpreted by Monty 
(maybe) that way.  I know Jerry and have spoken to Monty before, and 
both are rational folks.

I think the Pocono issues about yellow flags are valid, and the 
consistency issue with respect to rules like flag interpretation are 
needed and would have only a positive effect on club racing.  I was a 
participant in the "full course yellow" race, as was Bob Scotto, and I 
was pretty clear on the situation after one complete lap.  However, 
other drivers didn't get it, and I was passed on the front straight by 
a car in another class.  I believe this was the same car that passed 
Mark Forrester also.  I got CRN today, and the driver was listed as 
finishing ahead of both of us. Here comes the whining part - this 
result should have been adjusted.  Not because the "points standing" 
matters, but because the rules need to be enforced evenly.

I think Monty is wrong (sorry Monty - I still like you!) about the 
"pass on the front straight because the area was clear etc..".  This 
just isn't right when there are yellow flags displayed at every 
station.  Full course Yellow means NO PASSING AT ALL.  There can't be 
any other interpretation of this rule, with the exception of a car 
with a problem that is waving others by and moving slowly on the 
track.

Whine number two - one of the cars in my class was running underweight 
and without certain critical engine parts that (because they were 
missing) contributed to lower engine accessory drag.  This car was to 
"run for fun only" and was not to be classified.  When this car passed 
me under power on the back straight I did not make an attempt to pass, 
as this was a car not classified and had more power than just about 
anyone in the class as a result.  Wasn't I surprised when CRN listed 
this car as finishing ahead of me in the standings.  Sure - who cares 
right??  This is all for fun, no points, friendly (but intense) 
competition, right?  Well - even with this attitude and mindset, you 
still have to have consistent rule enforcement.

To that end, I wrote a letter to Alan Freidman a few years ago.  Here 
it is.

BEGIN LETTER

Alan Friedman
PCA Club Racing Chairman
10905 Hunter Station Road
Vienna VA 22181

December 1, 1994

Dear Alan,

I hope your "off season" has been going well.  I have been spending 
some time in the garage the past few weeks inspecting and cleaning my 
car in preparation for Sebring in Feb '95.  There may be few 
"improvements" that can be made at the same time, if I think 
creatively!

First, thanks for all your good work for PCA Club Racing these past 
three years.  It seems amazing to me that we are about to enter the 
fourth season on Club Racing this spring.  Without your initial push 
to get this thing going, I think a lot of us would be bored to tears 
with Drivers Education Events by now - these races pose a great 
challenge and are a lot of fun for all concerned.  I've made many new 
friends as a result of club racing, and had some super, safe 
competition.

It is the matter of safety that has prompted me to write this letter. 
 During the Group 2 Race at Pocono this year (the race group you were 
in!) there was a serious incident between two cars.  Since I was 
spinning around on the grass during that incident, I can't make any 
relevant comment on the incident other than to note that the track 
suddenly got very slippery from rain in the area near the exit to the 
banking (hence my time in the grass).  What concerns me was what 
happened after the incident.  It seemed to take the event organizers a 
very long time to black flag the field after the incident, despite 
many racers gesturing that they desired the field to enter the pits as 
the rain became more steady over the entire track.  When the field was 
brought in, they were told that the race would resume in a few 
minutes.

When several racers, myself included, asked about having an 
opportunity to change to "rain tires" the event organizers responded 
that the race would resume very shortly and there was not enough time 
to change tires.  As a result, I elected to not continue the race and 
headed back to the garage.  Many other racers, including yourself, 
chose not to continue.  I cannot speak for all of these gentlemen, but 
several I spoke to expressed concern about driving in a pouring 
rainstorm on "race tires", be they slicks or DOT race versions.  The 
actual group 2 race was not resumed until 45 minutes after the field 
was pitted, which would have allowed everyone to change tires, have 
hot chocolate, visit the bathroom and reorganize in the hot pits!  I 
am not unhappy with the volunteers operating the race, as they seem to 
be flying "by the seats of their pants" and had no clear direction on 
how to proceed.

I spoke to several friends in the SCCA, and they explained that sprint 
races that begin dry and change to wet conditions are black flagged at 
the first sign of serious rain.  The competitors are given 15 minutes 
to change tires, and the race group is reformed in the hot pits and 
the race restarted with the laps remaining (sounds like fun for the 
pit crew!).  This seems a sensible rule to handle a dangerous 
situation.  While not every driver in Group 2 had rain tires waiting 
in the garage, most did.  Driving a race in the rain can be 
tremendously challenging, I drove Road Atlanta last year in conditions 
similar to Pocono at its worst and had terrific time!

On another related subject, the question of restarting a race that has 
been stopped seems rather inconsistent.  At the Bridgehampton race 
this year, the Group 2 race was stopped after ~2/3 of the race was 
complete due to numerous cars off the track in a variety of areas. 
 The race was not restarted, and the finishing order was rolled back 
several laps to when the race was only 1/2 complete.  At Pocono, we 
had completed 11 of 20 laps and the race was restarted in the order of 
the cars that completed the last "black flagged" lap!

I guess what I am asking for here is some national direction on "rules 
of engagement".  Whether PCA adopts the SCCA procedures for various 
race protocol rules or uses a hybrid of SCCA and PCA rules seems less 
important than that each PCA Race Event be run with a clear set of 
guidelines on these and other rules concerning race "business".  I 
think it would be helpful to the sponsoring regions to have clear set 
of rules to operate under, and the attending national steward would 
have a clear course of action in the covered circumstances, as he does 
for Tech Inspection.

I'm certainly not looking to create more paperwork for the PCA Racing 
National committee.  If you desired, I would be willing to do the 
legwork on creating a Race Protocol Guide for PCA Club Racing.

Sincerely,


Chris Brown, Car Number 25!
