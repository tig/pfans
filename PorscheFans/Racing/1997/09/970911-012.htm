Having followed this thread on PCA Club Racing for the past several days, I
thought I would toss in my two cents -- First, Monte Smith has been the
Chief Steward the past two years at our Brainerd Club Race and did an
outstanding job, maintaining clear positive control.  I would tend to put a
lot of credibility, trust and weight into his perspective of Pocono and the
"yellow" situation.  
What finally caused me to comment though, was Paul's comments about the
"even more carnage at Road America" -- from an earlier posting (requoted
below), I have the impression that Paul wasn't in attendence, but rather
going on what he had heard.  I'm always a little cautious about commenting
on situations I haven't seen myself - - but having participated at Road
America over Labor Day weekend, here are some observations.   While I don't
have the actual "incident reports" ( and never will ), most of the "carnage"
involved single driver incidents, not metal to metal contact, or the result
of a lack of racing room.  Two separate "offs" in Turn 14 (one hung up on
the top of the Armco), both single driver errors; car spin in Turn 5 damage
against guard rail, no other car involved; big time wreck in Turn 1, single
car incident when the seat bolster came loose and wedged under the clutch
resulting in no good downshift for corner (again, no other car involved);
spin at the exit of Turn 1 in the wet, car makes contact with Armco, single
car involved.  There was also significant car damage in Turn 3, I'm not so
sure about that, but again believe no other car was involved, other than the
driver going for an aggressive pass and not making it.

Common theme:  aggressive driving, not necessarily a lack of racing courtesy
or room by others. It may be getting more competitive, and at the front of
the pack things may be getting "closer", but there is still good racing,
willingness to give some room, and a lot of fun to be had.  BUT, you had
better be ready for your car to be a total loss -- more likely a result of
your own internal pressure, than that of others.  If that's uncomfortable,
its a potential fact of life -- whether in Club Racing or in "Driver's Ed"
on a high speed track.  (By the way, the "carnage" at Road America included
a few incidents in the driver's ed sessions, including a roll-over at Turn
13 with an instructor in the car.)

Club Racing has opened up some great new avenues for using our Porsches,
whether you are a hard core racer, or someone like myself who just hopes to
make it to 2-3 races a year.  Just figure out what your personal objective
is -- hopefully to have fun as a primary goal, and keep an eye out for the
other drivers around you.
