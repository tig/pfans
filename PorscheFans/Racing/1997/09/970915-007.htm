	Paul,
	
	You should not be discouraged from club racing because of the few serious 
incidents that you've seen or heard about.  Is it completely safe? Absolutely 
not!  But neither is anything in life.  However,  the risks in Club Racing are 
certainly proportional to how hard you compete.  If like myself you push 
10-10ths,  the risks are significantly higher, then competing casually, but 
just as fun.  The comradery is not to be missed!  You will not reget it.  I 
play to run up front and hopefully finish 1,2 or 3.  The expense and risks are 
significantly higher at this level, but this is my choice.  Participate, at 
your level, for the fun of it and drive 8 or 9 tenths. It is highly unlikely 
that someone will take you out on the track, but that's a risk.  It's a clichy 
" that's life too short", and I've been reminded way too much lately, that's 
why I play. 	
	
	Bob
	88 911 F(legally prepared, because it wouldn't be fun any other way.)
