Interesting discussion going on here - lots of imput and good food for
thought.  Just want to correct one small mis-perception, if I may:  not all
huge transports rolling into races are for the big-buck "sporty car" crowd
alone, toting heavily sponsored vehicles.  One of the cars that rolls off
one of the 2  Johnson Autosport transports is my little F-stocker Carrera
(#186).  The reason I joined the "transport condo" that Bob Johnson created
is so I can participate in more than 3 races a year! Being up here in
Minnesota, not on the way to anything (other than the North Pole!), the
transport makes it possible for me to go to races on the east coast, the
west coast and in between, at less cost than a SUV, trailer, time off work
and expenses on the road.  I can have Bob haul my car, fly to San Fran for
$150 RT, do the fantastic Sears Point race, miss only one day of work and
still come out money ahead.  Not a bad deal, I'd say!  Next time you see our
trailers, come over to have a cold one at the end of the day with us, and
laugh at our authentic Minnesota accents - you betcha!  teresa.
