During this time, a number of people were passed (under yellow), including
me, and the correction to the standings never happened.  

Cal, good points, was the chief steward aware of the passing. The corners
workers should have called it in. The person in charge of all club races is
a pca national chief steward.

I know from all my work with time trials that the corner workders don't see
everything but in this case sounds like they should have a more to one
racer was passed. I do know the Alan and Axle to inforce the rules as I
have worked with them for the last two sears point races.
