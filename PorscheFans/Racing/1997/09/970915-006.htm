The Willow Springs race is behind us and it came together like a PCA Club
race 
should.  The race organizers did a great job, the racing was excellent, 
incidents were minor and few and everyone seemed to have a good time. Even
the 
weather cooperated and the high desert was sunny and warm but not HOT.  A 
breeze made it feel downright comfortable. 
 
Milt Minter was the Grand Marshall and honored guest and was kind enough to 
hand out the Mazza Vineyards champagne to the top finishers and pose for
pix.  
Milt is somewhat of a racing legend from the 50's and 60's and there was a 
nice display of pictures of his racing career in a number of cars including 
pcars. Milt, who has qualified for seniors discounts at Denny's for some 
years,  solidified his legend status by arriving at the event on his Harley 
with his suitcase strapped across his saddlebags.  Race organizers presented=
 
him with a "Grand Marshall" award, an engraved sterling silver serving tray.
 
Some cad in the audience incorrectly identified it as a drip pan for the 
Harley....... 
 
There were about 65 cars running in two groups, the stock cars in group 2
and 
GT cars in 1.  They seemed to be about evenly split.  Once again there were 
about 6 cars in my class I stock.  After qualifying, Tom Charlesworth 
scrutineered the hell out of the stock classes and once again I came up 6 
pounds over the minimum.  That's with the spare tire, rear seat back and 3/4=
 
tank of gas!  I gotta put some lead in this tub before Thunderhill. 
 
When we gridded for the race my closest competitor was gridded about 6 
positions ahead of me.  He had been running a sec. or two slower than me and=
 
some other cars had benefitted from having 5-6 seconds shaved off their 
qualifying times by timing and scoring problems.  Initially I was a bit
bummed 
but when I checked the cars between us I knew that they'd all get by him in 
short order as they were 2 and 3 classes up and all had been running faster
in 
practice.  Sure enough, the faster cars jumped away at the start and there
he 
was in my sights with nothing but air and 6 car lengths between us by turn
3.  
I got by him with a late braking inside pass in 3 on the second lap.  Gee, 
that was too easy, I wonder if he felt bad because they screwed up his times=
 
and gridded him up so far and let me by.  But noooooo, he's on by butt and 
trying to pass. I guess he couldn't have felt too bad.  Managed to hold him 
off but he drove a good race.  We were running within a half second and I 
think his fastest lap was a couple of tenths than mine.   
 
So, my third Willow Springs race fades into vivid memory with a great big 
thank you to the organizers, Monte, Tom and Milt and all those other drivers=
 
who make these events fun and possible. 
 
See you at Thunderhill in November......
