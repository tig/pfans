 A few weekends ago I visited Laguna Seca for the CART show.  I was able to
go on Friday which was quite nice since the crowds are a mere fraction of
Saturday/Sunday numbers.  During my first round of the paddock, I was
surprised to discover a team of people, led by Alwin Springer, unloading a
Porsche GT-1.  They were using a transport which I believe was borrowed from
Martin Snow.  Anwyay, I was very shocked to see this car at Laguna because it
wasn't really a part of the CART circus.  This is the car that Bob Wollek
spun at LeMans (his co-drivers were H.-J. Stuck and T. Boutsen).

The "crew" invited me in for a (brief) closer look and told me that the car
was there for an exhibition.  It was driven by factory driver Alan Mc Nish,
who is also a test driver for the Benetton F1 team.  The exhibition drives
were in between practice and qualifying runs throughout the weekend.  They
were intending to conduct some testing on Monday (gearboxes, turbos, et
cetera) and the people that run Laguna Seca asked them to bring the car in
early to drum up some enthusiasm for the FIA/SportsCar event.

Well, I immediately called my wife and asked her to alert some friends from
the Porsche Club.  As many of you know, the FIA GT cars will be at Sebring
and Laguna this year.  I have been told that Porsche plans to have at least
two factory cars at each event.  The Laguna event conflicts with a Golden
Gate PCA Region Time Trial, so many of us were faced with missing the
"factory" GT-1 on what might be its only trip to the U.S.  I figured my
friends would be eager to see the car, and might make a special trip to
Laguna on Saturday.

I spoke at some length with the crew from Weissach and to a gentleman from
the PR firm which works for PCNA.  The PR fellow invited myself and my
friends (all PCA members and track drivers) to a private tour of the car
conducted by Springer and Mc Nish on Saturday afternoon.

This tour was scheduled for the press, but there were only two press people
there.  David Coleman (writes for Excellence) was one of them.  Anyway, my
small group was pretty much the center of attention, and got a detailed look
inside and out with full explanations of everything from Springer and Mc
Nish.  We were in their cordoned-off paddock for about 45 minutes.  Nice car!

During the time I was at or in their paddock, a steady stream of racers came
by to chat with Alwin and/or sit in the car. Here is a brief list:

Juan Fangio (CART driver)
Gil De Ferran  CART driver)
Mario
Tommy Kendall (SCCA Trans AM)
Buddy Lazier (IRL driver)
Dario Franchitti (CART driver; came to visit with his fellow scotsman)

A most excellent adventure, especially since on the same weekend I got a
detailed technical tour of a '97 Reynard/Ford from CART driver Charley
Nearburg and the Payton-Coyne crew.
