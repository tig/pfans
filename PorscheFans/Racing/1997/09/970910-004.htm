From this statement I infer that you were the Chief Steward of this
event. You do not directly state such, but I will proceed under that
assumption.

<<Then, timing wanted to disqualify three guys who made passes
between the last corner (under yellow) and the start/finish line
(checker
with no yellow).  These were legal passes (they were past the yellow
flag
station, could see the checkered flag and, further, could see that there
was
nothing wrong on the track between them and this next flag station.>>

There are many who would disgree with you on the actual point where a
yellow flag is or is not in effect. Many sanctioning bodies consider the
yellow to be in effect until the car has passed a corner station where
the flag has been withdrawn. The actual interepretation should have been
spelled out in the driver's meeting. Was it?

Regarding the last corner under yellow and the start/finish line under
checkered, weren't the previous laps under full-course yellow? Did you
intend positions to be gained/lost based upon people closing under
extended yellow only to race for a quarter mile at the very end? How
were they supposed to be informed of your intentions?

<<Jerry, the ex-racer, wasn't running at Pocono because "racing is
getting far
too serious."  Well, I have a flash, sports fans, it was just as serious
when
I raced at Second Creek six years ago as it is today.  The competition
at
that race was tight and we all placed ourselves and our equipment in
harm's
way just as we did yesterday at Las Vegas.  He is wrong when he writes
that
13/13s were "unusual" in the early years; the number of 13/13 incidents
has
remained almost exactly the same per race during each of the first five
years
of the program.  He is wrong when he writes that "cheating in the stock
classes is the norm."  This year Harry and his crew have been checking
into
motors, cams, compression, etc., etc. and they have been finding what
most of
us suspected:  Cheating is a figment of the losers imagination.   The
number
of people who are really trying to cheat is very, very small.  The
number who
are accused of it because they drive well is much, much larger.>>

Based upon recent history involving numerous bent cars and serious
mishaps that endangered driver's lives at Summit Point, Lime Rock, and
Pocono, I would have to agree with Jerry's comments. It does appear that
the 13/13 rules is having less than anticipated effect on maintaining
good discipline. It also appears that the level of competition may have
been affected by pressures induced by sponsorships.

<<Perhaps you can forgive Jerry for his misconceptions in that he
doesn't race,
but it is hard to believe that Bob Scotto and Barry Lenoble are the only
people who are on this list who know what the program is all about.  The
truth is that the vast majority of our members know the rules and abide
by
them; most do not pass under yellow and most are out there for one
reason and
that is to have fun.  The vast majority see cheating as stupid
considering
what there is to gain.  At each and every event we have more
participants
than we had the year before and more and more of our events are sold
out.
 There are still far more "atta boys" and hugs than there is grumbling. 
As a
matter of fact, I have seen more passing under yellow, frequency of
incidents
and reported infractions on copies of last weeks PorscheFans than I've
seen
at any of our races in a year.>>

In defense of Jerry, (whose last name I don't even know but whom I have
traded numerous correspondences in private lately concerning the present
state of PCA club racing solely at my behest) I must state that I am
surprised that you find you must attack him after he freely contributed
his time to help in the running of the Pocono event. From what I
understand he was the T&S spotter on the roof of T&S while the race in
question occurred. You may disagree with his opinions, but you surely
must acknowledge his contributions to the event. As a former racer who
had great vantage I would think his observations should be held in great
esteem.

Regarding the state of club racing from my perspective (as a very
interested observer who is keenly interested in participating), I find
that I am somewhat discouraged by the difference between perception and
reality. On one hand you have vintage racing rules used ostentiably to
minimize contact and the lack of full safety equipment that is required
for racing by other organizations. On the other hand you have the
history of the last four races involving dozens of bent cars and 3 of
the last 4 events involving life threatening mishaps. 

I am coming to the conclusion that PCA club racing is just that. It has
lost whatever vintage roots with which it may have started and it is now
in the realm of wheel-to-wheel racing replete with big sponsors and
enclosed trailers. But there is nothing inherently wrong with this. As
an SCCA member I am fully aware of the current dilemna in club racing
that has allowed numerous groups to directly compete. However, it is
incumbent upon the organizers to properly assess the current situation
and respond by requiring the necessary level of safety equipment, e.g.
roll cages and 3-layer drivers suits (or 2 layer with Nomex underwear).

I would also suggest that the PCA closely examine the checks and
balances that the SCCA has evolved over decades to ensure that all
aspects of the racing program are functioning properly. As a start I
would recommend adopting the GCR.
