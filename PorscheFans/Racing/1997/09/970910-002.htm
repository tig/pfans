I'd like to thank everyone that commented on Passing Under Yellow. With =
the exception of a few,
most feel there is no other interpretation of flags. This is good, very =
good. It renews my confidence
in the drivers around me.

According to Monty, there were not that many reports of failing to =
comply to the yellow during the=20
race group 3 at the Pocono. I'll have to accept this as fact, as I was =
in the car, not listening to the
radio. But then it makes me wonder how the flaggers at turn 6 (left =
hander in the infield) could have
missed the obvious pass on the inside, right next to their flag station. =
Barry acknowledged he passed
Mark under yellow. (Mark told him.)

Monty commented that some passing was allowed between turn 10 and the =
checker flag, because it could
be done safely. Hmmm...so if I was to go with this, I would assume that =
once I was past the yellow flag=20
at turn 10, and I can't see if there is a flag at the bowl, as long as I =
don't see any problem, and I feel=20
I can safely pass someone, I can and not be penalized? Should I also =
assume this could be applied elsewhere
on the track, like after the chicane?

Also, as far as protesting, I have to confess that I didn't formally =
protest. I did talk to the chief
scrutineer about the conditions of the last couple of laps (Why full =
course standing yellow), and talked=20
to another event operator about the passing under yellow and was told =
that, "yes, we know about it. There
were alot of reports and the adjustments are being made by timing and =
scoring." But as we know, nothing happened. In my case I wasn't going to =
protest, for what? To go from 12th to 11th?=20

The real issue here is compliance and enforcement. Without these two =
things, we'd have anarchy on the
track.

Regarding cheating, there a few that do, but it's not the norm. I asked =
someone in F class how they could
pull me so much on the straight. We both have 911's, 3.2 with 915's. I'd =
be ahead through the turn, carry=20
more momentum, but he'd walk by me. Only to have me pass him in the next =
turn. His comment was that his
gearing is different than mine. Hmmmm..... =20

But as I read consistently in your comments-- this is for fun-- this is =
for the social aspects-- we are out=20
there with our fellow PCA'ers enjoying our cars. So, why in the world =
would you want to cheat?=20
Again reconfirming the reason that I love the cars, the sport, and the =
people of PCA.

Safe driving,
Cal
