    I wanted to thank the group for all of your help regarding the purchase
    of my new race car.  I did buy the 1969 911 RS Replica mentioned in
    several posts to the group.

    I entered the car in the PCA Road America challenge over labor day
    weekend.  There were several levels of good and bad news.

    First the good news.....it was a TON OF FUN (isn't that why we are
    racing).  The car was without problems for entire 4 days (I was able to
    practice with the Track Time school on Thursday).  If the Labor day
    event was typical of PCA events, I will be participating for a long
    time.  Coming from the SCCA world, I feel that PCA is better in every
    respect (just my opinion).  The SCCA could learn efficiencies from the
    US Post Office (at least in the midwest).  There were some "incidents"
    but much less than at other races I have recently participated in.  I
    think many of the complaints in recent posts are indicative of all
    amateur racing venues.  I think one weekend at an SCCA regional event
    would make most people realize how well PCA racing works (again, just
    my opinion...no flames please).

    ....and the Bad News....my 911 is really set up for vintage racing.  I
    am running a 2.4 single plug motor.  GT-4S runs up to 2.8 liters  This
    was a problem at Road America (a 4.1 mile track with three long
    straights...yes, you should feel sorry for me about now!).  I was only
    able to squeeze a 2:45 while the top dogs in my class were about 10
    seconds a lap better.  Not too bad for my first outing.  I think the
    motor gave up at least 2 or 3 seconds per straight.  I might upgrade
    the cylinders and pistons to 2.7 liters which should bridge the gap
    considerably (ANY ADVICE?????).

    ...and the REALLY BAD NEWS....I was really jamming in the race, having
    the time of my life.  I actually caught up with a few of the 4s and the
    slower 3s cars in the race.  I could catch them on the corners but they
    would pull away from me on the straights.  I could catch an occasional
    tow but they usually shook me.  I was dicing with a 3S car (930, I
    think).  I caught him under breaking going into turn 8 and was 6 inches
    off his tail going through the carousel.  At the end of the
    carousel, I went for my pass on the right and ooooooopppps caught 3rd
    gear instead of 5th.   VAAAAAAROOOOMMMM.  I thought I blew the
    engine...very little power...but no smoke or oil.  I hobbled back to
    the pits.  Luckily, I only broke a rocker arm and bent a valve.  It
    could have been much worse.

    All in all, it was a GREAT time.  I am going to attend the VSCDA event
    this weekend to compete against lesser cars (:-) I also plan to do as
    many events as I can by year end and possibly Sebring over the winter.

    Once again, thanks to everyone for your help.
