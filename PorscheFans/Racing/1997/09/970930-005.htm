Hi all,

I actual got to drive my car at an autocross.  I haven't driven it
since early spring.  The past few auto-x's I've been driving a
friends 944 na.

Unfortunately I'm having some bad problems with understeer.  I'm
going to Heartland Park this weekend for a Driver's Ed, and would
like to get the problem resolved.

I would like to get the best compromise set up between track and
auto-x.

My cars alignment is as follows :

front:

camber -.9 of a degree
toe-in factory spec

rear:

camber -1 degree


I'm currently running Yoko A032r tires.  I increased my camber
because I'm running the tires on the street (basically to and
from the track), and I didn't want to wear out the inside of
the tires.

I'm probably going to decrease my camber to about -1.5 degrees
before I go to Kansas.  Also, what are some sway bar adjustments
I can make to decrease understeer?  I have weltmeister adjustables
front and rear.

Thanks!

chris, eating pointer cones all the way...
