I currently own a 993 and am looking to build a track car. I've
completed 7 of the required 8 driver ed days and hope to get the last
one in by december and then make an application for a rookie license.
Right now, I'm looking around for a car that's already built up or one I
can modify for the track. In talking with others in our region and
different events, there are clearly different opinions regarding which
cars make good club racers and which ones don't. My bias is toward an
87/88 911 coupe but several PCA racers have suggested either a
944turbo/late model 968. I've never driven either one and would like
some input from those of you with experience with the 944 turbo/968 as
to handling, maintenance, modification possibilities, etc. thanks.
