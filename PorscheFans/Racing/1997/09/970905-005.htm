Hello out there,

Continuing the thread on club racing. I'll chip in my opinion as a
newcomer. This was m first year club racing, and I completed two
events, Lime Rock in April, and Pocono last month.

I HAD A BLAST

I have an 89 944 turbo, and I was in E stock. My car is 100% stock, so
I knew that I would not be competitive. I just wanted something more
than a driver ed event. I don't have that much experience, did my first
DE event in 94, got hooked, and took it from there.

So I find myself at Lime Rock with my little car, that I drove to the
event. I see lots and lots of big rigs unloaded major impressive cars.
Yeah, I was apprehensive and thinking what have I gotten myself into?
However, once I got out on the track and started driving, I knew I made
the right decision. Yes, a lot of people passed me, but I passed some
too (not even under the yellow flag :-) ). My goal for the weekend was
to bring the car home in 1 piece, and to not finish last. I suceeded on
both counts, and I had a wonderful time.

The people I met at the race were all very nice. On the track I gave
and was given racing room, and I never feared for my car or my life
(OK, I did a few times, but it wasn't too bad).

I decided to do another event, the much publicized Pocono race.
That race was also lot of fun. Again, I wasn't competitive for 
a class win, but I found people to race with, and I'll describe the 
competition as fierce, fair, and fun. 

I don't know anything about cheating, nor do I care to. Why someone
would cheat to win is beyond me. The winner at Lime Rock got a $.30
ribbon, at Pocono not much more. My car is legal, I had a lot of fun
racing. I wasn't competitive, and I didn't care. Regardless of how
prepared you or your car is, you'll find other people to race with. At
Pocono, I finished 8th of 12 in class, and a few cars had problems and
didn't finish.  The fact that I finished towards the bottom of my class
didn't dampen my fun one little bit.

Perhaps in a few years I'll get tired with running mid pack, and decide
to do something about it. For next year, I'll most likely make some
cheap and easy improvements to my car (springs and sway bars, maybe
some race seats), do some more races, and hopefully have another safe
and fun season.

If anyone out there is thinking about going club racing. I recommend
it! However, brace yourself for the fact that your car might get
destroyed (it does happen), you personally might get hurt, or you will
find out that you aren't Hans Stuck! If you can accept that, you will
have fun at a club race.
