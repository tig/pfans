Fellow Racers,

I've completed my first season of PCA Club racing and I have to say it's =
been a blast, and
I'm looking forward to next season. However, I do have a few thoughts =
I'd like to share and=20
see how others might feel.

*	I ran at LRP, Summit Point, and Pocono. Each event had its share of =
incidences, in each case, at least one major one, sending someone to the =
hospital. These incidences remind us all of the risks we face with this =
sport. (This is for fun, remember?)  I also ran with EMRA (Eastern =
Motorsports Racing Association) and SCCA. Each of these clubs requires =
full cage with side intrusion protection, however, PCA rules don't. =
Maybe it's time to consider this as a requirement?  I understand this =
might raise the cost to get a car into club racing, but shouldn't safety =
of the participants be the number 1 concern?

*	Over the past three years of tracking, I've seen numerous cases of =
failing strut mounts on 911s. To prevent this from happening, a simple =
wleding of a gusset is required. I think was standard on RSR's? Wouldn't =
it be reasonable to recommend this to club racers driving older 911's?  =
There are requirements for the control arms of the 944.

*	During the club race at the Pocono, there was an incident in race =
group 3 which caused a standing yellow condition for the last couple of =
laps. During this time, a number of people were passed (under yellow), =
including me, and the correction to the standings never happened.  It =
seems that if we have rules, everyone should have to adhere to them, and =
it is important that the people operating the event enforce them. If =
this doesn't happen, then the next time standing yellow is given during =
a race, everyone will ignore the flags and continue passing to gain =
position.

Regards,
Cal
