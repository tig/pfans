 We were explicitly told by the National Steward, Monty Smith,

You have to be kidding, if half the field ignored one of the major flags at
a race then they should be penalized or disqualified. 

I guess Alan Friedman has something to talk to his national core of chief
stewards about. Being the chief steward for GGR time trials we send people
home for ignoring the flags. I don't like doing it but it happens. I for
one will not jeopordize safety for laps or track time. 

We do run the time trials under white (safety vehicle on course) and yellow
at specific corners. If someone passes or ignores the yellow they get to
come in and have a chat with me. When this happens I walk and talk real slow.

Club racing has lost some it its appeal the the "normal" pca racer as I
agree it is far to "professional" and expensive. I new class structure
might fix the brung what drive for average racer but not sure I have not
been real envolved in pca club racing until this year.  This year chairing
the Thunderhill race has made me more aware of the club race area and do
feel that it has it place and is still building on a good framework. 

PCA club racing is three years old and still working out some of the bugs.
Hopefully no more compromising of safety will occcur.
