Well written and thoughtful post. I started Club Racing in 92 at the first
race east of the Mississippi. At that time it was mostly guys who were long
tern instructors that wanted a bit more excitement. It worked great for a
while. After the race there was many attaboys and back slapping. Everyone was
happy to participate and seemingly participation was more important than race
standings. That lasted about 2 years until people started racing their
wallets and not leaving their egos behind. In the early years of Club Racing
a 13/13 violation was very unusual. Now we have totaled cars and serious
injuries. Cheating in the stock classes is the norm. Winning is everything
with many people and commercial transporters are everywhere. The whole flavor
of the events has changed and I, for one, no longer enjoy the venue. I am not
alone. As a result I sold my car and became a part of the scoring and timing
crew at the Pocono race. What I observed reinforced my decision. There are
just too many commercial entities present.  They need their drivers to win so
prestige and business rise. It's a shame but I guess it is natural evolution.
Club Racing is now big business.
The sight of a 
 helicopter was tragic to say the least. I don't know the answers but for a
start Alan and his crew need to take a long hard look at what they have
created. The bad as well as the good.
