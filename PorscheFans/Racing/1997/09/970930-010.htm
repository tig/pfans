Scott Cragin - 

Since you have the adjustable front bar in hand, and are on a tight
budget, what's to think about?  Put it in.  It won't hurt anything - it's
adjustable.  Set it full loose, and then tighten it between run sessions until
you think you have more push than you want, and back off to the
previous setting.

Next thing I'd buy would be an adjustable rear bar (same size).  Then you
can play one off against the other - tighten rear to get rid of push, tighten
front to get rid of looseness, etc.  Fact is, I ended up with both front and
rear full tight, and have left them there for years (car is lowered and has
usual but not extreme bigger bars).

Putting in bigger bars is certainly good for track use, but is more
complicated  (rear, especially), will change your ride height, which you
will have to adjust, and will most likely change your rear alignment unless
you are awfully good, so you will end up having to set ride height and
realign after the bar transplant.  That's not necessarily bad (time to lower
car a bit and get more of a track alignment), but $ (unless you do it
yourself, which is quite something to bite off at what one suspects is
your current state of Porsche wrench skill (soon to grow by leaps and
bounds, though).  Besides, the most cost effective way to do this is to
grow into it - as your seat time and hence skills grow, you can bring the
car up to your new level with the dough you have been accumulating for
the purpose, the deals you have picked up along the way, etc.  It takes a
new track driver some time to exceed the capacities of the most stock
911, even if he thinks it is the car which limits him rather than the other
way round.

Make yourself a backing plate for mounting the front bar from 1/8 - 3/16
steel stock.  This is a do it yourself hole saw and hack saw job.   If you
weld the nuts to the backing plate  you can install without the huge pain
of removing the gas tank, with a bit of patience and ingenuity.  don't use
the Weltmeister "U-tab" deal.  shame on them for selling such a thing all
these years.  Bruce A has a picture in The Book of one of these u-bolt
deals tearing out the sheet metal.

P.S.  FYI, moving the adjuster the same distance out at the far end of the
lever as at the near (shorter) end does not produce the same increase
or decrease in pound-feet of anti-roll resistance.  I thought it would be
linear just like a simple lever, but it is not.  In fact, it is a 4th power deal
(or maybe a 3d - haven't got the equation handy).  So make larger
changes when out toward full soft, and smaller when in near full tight,
as you are adjusting.
