OK - I've been quiet long enough.

The recent posts on the cost of competing in Club Racing meant a lot 
to me.  I started in the 2nd ever PCA Race (Summit Point 1992 "First 
PCA Race East of the Mississippi!").  That race put me in the A2 class 
(remember the old letter based super classes?), thanks to a 3.184 
liter motor in my 73 RS replica.  The winner of that first A2 race was 
Don Cox, driving a 3.6 converted SC with Alcon Brakes and some neat 
aerodynamics picked up from spare IndyCar (nee CART) parts and 
Goodyear GSCS tires.  This experience was a lot of fun, and everyone 
was "respectful" of the others on the track.  Most folks knew each 
other, as the field consisted of instructors from the east cost 
regions.  I continued to race four races a year (The NorthEast 
Championship, Ha Ha, Summit, Lime Rock, Pocono, Bridgehampton - 
sigh...) in Class A2 and B2, depending upon what engine was in the car 
that week.  My car evolved from a RS replica to an 74 IROC/RSR 
replica.  The 3.18 liter motor got replaced with a 3.0 liter high 
compression race motor, and the car sprouted one of the first large 
scale rear wings in PCA Racing.  I won some races, (when Mike Trombly 
didn't show up) and placed well in most others.  I enjoyed meeting the 
competitors in my class, and found them to be gentlemen with a 
fighting spirit on the track.  I never had an incident, and enjoyed 
the competition tremendously.  It helped that I really like modifying 
my own car, and had the tools and time to do everything myself (paint 
and cellette bench work excluded).

Three years ago I gave up on the "modified" classes when the new rules 
where announced.  It really didn't have anything to do with the rules, 
although they provided a convenient "excuse" for selling the car.  The 
real problem was the disparity of the cars in my class.  And, opposite 
to  what you might be thinking, I was the "curvebreaker" with the BEST 
car!  The competition aspect of racing has always been the draw for 
me, I and started racing "enduro karts" at Summit Point that same 
year.  This karting stuff is Great!  The cars were very equal, rules 
strictly enforced, races were 45 minutes long, allowing for a bad 
start to be overcome (and the starts are _standing_, by the way) and a 
new set of slicks cost $110 for the best Dunlops!  This was racing 
that required lots of strategy, patience and skill.  There was no 
"power passing" on the straights, and every little mistake cost you 
three or four positions instantly, as the other 40+ karts in the race 
were nipping at your heels (assuming you could get up front!).  And it 
wasn't slow, the beginner class I ran in was doing 100mph on the front 
straight at Summit and 1:33 laps.  The fast guys in twin motor karts 
were doing low 1:20's.

This experience led me to the conclusion that "spec" racing was the 
best way to experience intense competition.  And since competition was 
my goal, I looked back at PCA racing and the "spec/stock" classes.  I 
managed to sell my car, and part of the deal included a stock '86 951. 
 This was promptly traded for a PCA Race prepared 86 951 and I entered 
the '95 Pocono race that same week (Class F, 911 Carrara, Euro SC 
72-73S, 86-87 951).  The race went well, I was happy with my 
performance considering it was the first time driving the car.  I 
really enjoyed the closeness of the racing, and the fact that "power" 
wasn't much of a factor.  The 951 wasn't the best car to have in the 
class, but it could hold its own.  The drivers were great, some I 
knew, some I had never spoken to at length before.  The real shock was 
the number of cars in the class.  My previous "large field" in B2 had 
been twelve cars, most of the time there were five or so, and once in 
Atlanta I was the only B2 entrant - too bad I had a mechanical and 
DNS!  The F class race had twenty two cars in the CLASS, not the race 
group.  This was great!  No matter where you were in the pack, you had 
a race for position going on.

The past two years have seen my 951 break a spindle at Bridgehampton, 
which prompted me to replace the entire suspension with new, 
bulletproof parts.  This was expensive, but nothing like what the 
super class "constant cycle of modification" had cost.  When I was 
done, the car was very competitive in Class F.  I ran the car for two 
years in this configuration, and found that the times remained 
reasonably stable from year to year.  Yes, everyone went a little 
faster each year, but I think a lot of that can be chalked up to tire 
technology, experience and better alignment preparation.  The people 
in the class were great, as most PCA people I meet are.  We had lots 
of time to chat and get to know each other, dinners and lunches to 
socialize, and I met lots of good drivers with a sense of humor and 
reasonable lack of ego.

Now the bad news - people cheated.  This was one issue where the super 
class wasn't subject to much of in my time there, since there were so 
few rules.  But in the stock class, people were cheating.  Not 
everyone, but enough that it was noticeable.  I knew personally of 
people who had/have illegal Quaife Differentials, Raised Spindles, 
Resized A-Arms to improve handling, and subtle gearing changes. 
 Engine cheating was also discovered in some other classes, but I 
don't think this is rampant in Class F.  This really bothered me, as I 
was taking great pains to be as legal as required (but no more than 
that, of course!).

I sold my 951 a few weeks ago and am now looking for a Formula car to 
run in SCCA. This is not a reflection on PCA racing, rather it is my 
propensity to get bored quickly with any vehicle I own and desire to 
go ever faster.  It looks like a Formula Continental is going to be 
it, they have slicks and wings, large fields, a Pro series for the 
serious and boy are they fast!  The fast guys were doing 1:12.8 sec 
laps at Summit Point two weeks ago.  The best I ever went in my B2 car 
was 1:21.01 and I thought that was pretty fast!  Acquisition cost is 
similar to a good Class F car.  Ongoing costs look to be similar also, 
as long as you don't crash!

What about the friendly nature of PCA Racing, was I going to miss out 
on the relaxed nature of my conversations with the competitors in the 
stock class?  Well, the jury is still out, but when I visited Summit 
to spectate at the SCCA regional race there I met about twenty formula 
racers, all of whom were very gracious and spent time answering my 
stupid questions without any visible signs of pain.  I saw lots of 
competing racers sitting together "bench racing" and the lunch crowd 
didn't seem ready to plunge knives into each others backs.  So, things 
might work out on the social side as well.

I haven't written off PCA Club Racing, and will probably rejoin it at 
some point, but I guess the net of this little soapbox session is 
that:
PCA Stock Class has more cars to race against
PCA Stock Class is less expensive than super classes, but still costs 
$ to run up front
The people are great anywhere in PCA
A 2 liter formula car is faster than anything in the PCA super class 
by about 6 seconds at Summit Point ( Summit Best PCA GT Class Time 97 
time ~78.5 sec, SCCA FC Class time 72.8 sec)
Go Karts can teach you a lot

Thanks for the opportunity to vent a little.
