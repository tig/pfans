	The following is an e mail that I recieved from Harry Hall concerning RSR 
strut strenght and legality for PCA racing:
	
	Bob Scotto

You can use RSR struts (early sort) without the coil springs, but there is
no advantage at the mounting point.  They are stronger at the bottom where
the spindle attaches to the strut, so that they do not bend as easily as
the stock strut.  The spindle is raised so that the shocks work better if
you have seriously lowered your car (almost beyond street drivability) and
they were also decambered about half a degree for bias ply racing tires of
the mid-70's, so that your front camber will be even less desirable than
it is now.  Contrary to what you may have heard, 911 stock struts are not
prone to failure and not terribly weak.  I have never heard of a bent
spindle without wheel to curb or equivalent contact, and the gain from the
raised spindle is more than offset by the loss of negative camber.  If
your car is straight and you have not done some serious illegal machining
to it, you won't be able to get even 1.5 negative on the front with RSR
struts.  But feel free to go for it...it should slow you down a little.
