I've seen a number of postings lately complaining about the cost of PCA club
racing.  I've been lucky enough to race in a number of races over the last
five years, and yes, you are correct that the "bar" has gone up
significantly.  However, there is still room for someone to race on a low
budget.  A very good friend of mine races a 65 911 (the oldest regularly
driven 911 in the world, according to a plaque given him by the factory!)
and drives his car to and from the races with the track tires stuffed in and
on the car.  He frankly doesn't care where he places (sure he'd like to win
but its the participation that the programs about, right) and rather rates
his races based upon whether he has a good race within the race.  And he
usually does, as his class, I, is large and varied.
Another good place to look would be in G, where there are mainly SC's a
reasonably fast, fun car that is at the absolute bottom of its depreciation
curve.  There's not a lot that really expensive that can be done to the SC
and so the class is close and fun.  
I've got another friend who sold his C2 (despite being second in F two years
ago at Road America and obviously very competitive) and went to a J class
914-4 for more fun at a more rational price.  Yes, he's slow on the
straights but his driving ability has noticeable improved and he's having fun.
The point is, if you want to win, spend lots of money and try to pick a
class where few cars enter (my suggestion is GT1S).  If you want to become a
better driver, have a hoot and make friends for life, drop down to the lower
stock classes and have a good time (I found it interesting at the MOnterey
Historics this year that the really good, close racing was in the lower
horsepower lower buck groups whereas most of the high buck classes looked
like lapping sessions but gee, they sure looked good in their driving suits
with their matching transports, trophy babes, etc) -Bruce Boeder
