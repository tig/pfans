I have seen a lot here lately on "passing under yellow" and "cheating", and
I just had to kick in my .002.

For the record, Monty is an excellent steward, and his attention to safety
rivals mine. If any passes were made under yellow that were not acted on, He
was NOT made aware of them.

As to the reply to Monty's post about passing between the last corner and
the checker... if the course is full course yellow, then no one should pass
anywhere, except as a result of a wave-by. If it is a local yellow, no
passing from the flag to the incident. There are areas where it gets sorta
grey: Pass is initiated in sight of a yellow but completed before the flag
is a really big one.

My answer is that if you can see a flag, don't pass. However, it could be
argued that it was not technically "under yellow". I would have a personal
talk with a guy who split that kind of hair on me. Again, it is a little
situational.

It seems that the biggest issue is "full course yellow" vs "local yellow".
It has always been a tough area. That is why SCCA and the sanctioning body
formerly known as IMSA use a standing double yellow to indicate a full
course yellow. This was just instituted recently, and removes all guesswork
from the course condition. I think that PCAR would be wise to adopt it for
next season.

As always, racing is a matter of judgement, and there are always situations
that are not specifically spelled out (or our rules could look like the US
tax code) Drivers should use there best judgement and ALWAYS err on the side
of safety.

Now as to cheating: Cal really should talk to a steward about the guy who
claimed his gears were different, unless he was running prepared, in which
case his R&P could be different.

Of course, there is always exit speed. My little 944 passes much faster cars
all the time, just because my exit speed made up for our horsepower
difference. Who knows?
