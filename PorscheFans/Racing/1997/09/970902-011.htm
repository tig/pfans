  Hi all,

  I need some input  on replacement of the oil lines, particularly the
two that connects the oil tank to the filter and the filter to the right
side of the engine.  The problem that I am having is that these items are
hard to find....once I located a supplier I was quoted a price of no less
then $260 a piece "wow".    That just included the rubber hose I still
needed the aluminum coupler on each end of the pipe which took some abuse
in the removal process. If possible I want to get away from the whole
system and completely convert it to a 74' or later style oil system. at
least then I can buy the hoses at more reasonably price.

 My questions are
 1) can I modify the current system to accept different hoses and
fittings. What would I need and where would I get such parts.

2) I've been told you can use an oil tank , filter housing and lines off
a later year car and Its almost a bolt on replacement. Note... that my
car (1972 911T) does not have the front mounted oil cooler but instead
has one mounted on the engine with a simple clamp type fittings. Has
anyone ever done this sort of thing? If so what do I need and where would
I get these parts.

   I've talked to quit a few people and they either don't know anything
about it or they  don't stock the parts.  If any one would share there
great wisdom on this subject it would be greatly appreciated. Can leave
E-mail if desired.......Thanks
