09/03/97  Although still comatose, as of this date, Mike is responding to
occasional verbal stimulus.  He opens his eyes now and then but does not
appear to focus on anything, yet.  When asked by a family member to squeeze a
hand, he has done so a few times.  Mike has moved his left side considerably
and his right side somewhat less.  He is breathing unassisted via a
trachiotomy.  His doctors are considering moving him to Bryn Mawr Rehab as
early as later this week.  

We all continue to pull for Mike and his family.  More updates will follow
when we learn of changes in Mike's condition.
