<<SCCA's rule is you can't pass "from the flag until past the emergency
area."  One result of the Club Race hierarchy's distaste for lots of
rule
making is that you can't just look up in the rule book exactly what the
yellow flag passing rule is for our races.  You get it, if at all, in
the
driver's meeting.  Sometimes I have heard the SCCA formulation.  Other
times, I have heard something else, like:  until you can see a corner
station which is not showing a yellow flag.  I would hope we could
standardize.  I'd opt for the SCCA rule, as they have lots of experience
with it, but would happily settle for just always being on the same
page.>>

I believe the race in question was the E Stock/F Stock race where a car
spun at the end of the back straight( which is the best passing corner)
and sat there without restarting. As time went on people started
ignoring the yellow at that corner. 

Since the race is limited to 10 laps they were in a bit of a "damned if
you do/ damned if you don't" situation. In a 'real' race, they would
have dispatched the pace car and towed the car away since you can't race
if you can't pass, but this sort of thing happens all the time in
vintage racing where they don't clear the track - they give the entrants
their lap time instead.

The turn was a long way from the viewing area where I was and I haven't
driven the track so it is hard for me to judge how much potential impact
the car actually had on safety (perhaps Barry Lenoble or someone else in
atendance can chime in...), but it was clearly near the track in what
seemed like a a possibly dangerous position. 

This is obviously still no excuse for passing under yellow. I am a bit
disappointed the administrators let this one slide, particularly
considering the recent spate of bent cars and hurt drivers.

I think the PCA has to decide if club racing is supposed to be more like
SCCA road racing or more like vintage racing. In either case the flags
cannot be ignored.
