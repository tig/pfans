"While I don't have the actual "incident reports" ( and never will ), most
of 
the "carnage" involved single driver incidents, not metal to metal contact,
or 
the result of a lack of racing room."   
 
I have noticed there is a tendency in Club Racing to classify individual 
efforts of mashed metal as less relevant to the overall quality and safety
of 
an event than car to car contact.  I guess my perspective is that these 
incidents are just as dehibilitating to the program as car to car contact. 
A 
mistake that takes out aarmco is one that coincidently didn't take out
another 
car.  Potential Club Racers are just as intimidated by solo episodes of bent=
 
metal as car to car events. 
 
Here on the Leftcoast, the number of GT cars/race has been as great or
greater 
than the stock classes.  Many people in my region that time trial are 
intimidated by Club Racing, even though they may have dedicated track cars. =
 
They're intimidated by the perception that racing is much riskier than time 
trials.  They've been told that Club Racing is well run and as safe as
racing 
can be, vintage rules, 13/13, and you can run your street car etc.  Then
they 
go to an event as a spectator and see rubble and that perception is 
reinforced, so they decide to pass on joining the program and the program 
doesn't grow with additional participation..........this is the concern I 
have..... 
 
I think the volunteers who run our program are doing an excellent job of 
moving things along safely, given the tasks at hand.  Furthurmore, I think 
it's up to the participants to take more responsibility for the program and 
it's survival.   Yes, stuff happens on the race track.  But that's not an 
excuse for not policing, improving and enforcing the rules.  It's our
program 
and we should realize that when we make a bonehead move and crunch up a car,=
 
we're not just putting our own equipment at risk but putting the growth of
the 
program on the line. 
 
Also, on the topic of "big money", car haulers, sponsorship and 
grassroots..........I think it's great that people think enough of this 
program to spend the bucks to support an effort.  I think it's great to see 
some pro-cars running our in events, right along with my bottom feeder I
stock 
944, vintage 356's and the occassional rare 962. It's a testament to the job=
 
the folks who have organized this program have done to see these cars show
up 
and compete. 
 
Also, not all big rig car haulers have to be big bucks operations.  I may
have 
to haul two cars next year and have come to realize that I can have a
tractor 
trailer rig that's safer to operate with a 10,000lb. load in it than your
SUV 
with an open trailer behind it.  And I can do it for less than half the cost=
 
of that SUV tow vehicle.  So, if I show up next year and roll my I stock car=
 
out of a big rig, don't be askin' me for a donation to your favorite
charity.  
It ain't a big bucks operation and my "sponsor" gives me a slight break on
his 
labor rate when he services the car and a priority on scheduling to get it 
finished on time for an event. 
 
Thanks for the opportunity to sound off......now off to Willow 
Springs.....yowee!!!!
