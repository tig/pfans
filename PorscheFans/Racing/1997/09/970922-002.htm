Dear Bruce:
I am big on RSR front struts as they are already reinforced and don't crack
like the stock ones often eventually do.  However, the RSR inserts and rear
shock valving I don't like because they are based on having coil-overs. I'll
let you in on a secret -  the rebound is far too light! My secret will remain
how much rebound is right but I guarantee you that noone would believe me if
I told you anyway. But we've dynoed them and roadrace tested them and have it
right on the money!!  I don't know how anyone can get enough negative camber
(BFG R1's not considered in this discussion) without moving the front spindle
unless you totally modify the towers...  I personally moved up from 22mm to
23mm front and it really helped on the really high speed corners like we have
at Willow Springs (Brainerd too perhaps?). By the way does Paul Olson still
run with you in MN? If so please send him my best.

saw your posting on Porschefans about suspension set up.  Very interesting.
 Bob JOhnson out here in Minnesoda has built some very fast stock PCA racers,
 including an SC that his son and he drive to multiple class victories (Bob
 ran it at Road America and would ahve been third in D with his G car, if
 he'd classed it that way.  No G car was within 4 seconds a lap and only a
 couple of F cars were about the same as him) is setting up his cars almost
 identically, except with a 21 or at most 22 front torsion bar.  he also is
 big on RSR rear shocks and raising the front spindle.  you'll note that
 Bruce Anderson in his book talks about this and says it doesn't make any
 sense!  Bruce Boeder
