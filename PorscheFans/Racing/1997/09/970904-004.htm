Hey, Mike Willis - PCA Club Racing  is not 3 years old.  The First Ever club
race was held in June of 1992, so we are in our seventh season. 
Friedman and the boys keep more track of this than I, but from what I see
I don't think we are into a period of decline in enthusiasm and
participation.  

As to everything not being perfect, consider this:  the SCCA, which is in
about its 50th season, is rife with discussion about costs, racer
behavior, rules, etc.  Some of the vintage racers here (Colorado) think
PCA events are too aggressive, but in one of their big bore groups at the
Steamboat Springs races this last weekend reportedly had a red flag
incident in all but one of its sessions.  I conclude that some of this goes
with the territory.  Even in some of the SCCA spec racer classes, where
they work like crazy to control costs to level the playing field, more
money (new tires every weekend, for instance) means an edge.  Some
types of competition (one of the small sailboat classes comes to mind)
deal with this by assigning competitors their vehicle (IROC these days,
for instance).  That's just not realistic for us.

Does this mean we can't do better?  Of course not.  Attitude, attitude,
attitude (hard thing to change, though).  I like the concept of "racing
room," perhaps because it is like a requirement in sailboat racing where
you have to give competitors "buoy room," and can't force them to sail
into the rocks, yet this does not mean you have to roll over and play dead
- skill, boatspeed, guile, and perhaps a bit of luck still rules the results. 
Usually this works for Club Racing, though the starts tend to be dicey
when the adrenaline is especially high and the track funnels everyone
down too close to the green flag.  But not everybody is quite as well
housebroken as most of us think we are.  And I haven't yet had the
chance to get to one of the heavily attended races on the coasts or at
Elkhart.  Maybe people leave some of their ego along the way on the long
drive to the hinterlands. 

Racing isn't everyone's cup of tea.  The risks (mainly of car damage, but
we have just heard that what we all knew lurked in the background as a
possibility is real, alas) are higher than driver's ed.  And there just isn't
any realistic way around that, certainly not in a sprint race format.  Some
drivers with the wrong attitude have been kicked out.  Most of my fellow
drivers seem to have the right attitude, from what I see.  Some drivers
with attitudes which are just what we all want in our fellow competitors
and high levels of skill and experience have been placed on 13/13
because they made a mistake.  If they can make a mistake, I can make a
mistake, and so can everyone else.

In the abstract, I'd like to see a higher experience requirement for entry
into our arena.  I know I benefited greatly from seven years of driver's ed
before Club Racing came along.  But we are well ahead of SCCA and a
number of other venues as it is, the driver's ed programs across the
country, while not focused on racing, are really a quite extraordinary
vehicle for learning car control and getting comfortable in a track
environment.  And too high a barrier cuts off participation, no doubt about
it.  So I have no beef with where it is.

It is a grand adventure, this Club Racing.  We shouldn't lose sight of the
forest for the trees along the way.

Maybe Monte can enlighten us about this yellow flag business, though.  If
I backed off for a yellow flag and promptly got passed (especially by
someone I was racing with) and lost a place as a result I'd be pissed too.

SCCA's rule is you can't pass "from the flag until past the emergency
area."  One result of the Club Race hierarchy's distaste for lots of rule
making is that you can't just look up in the rule book exactly what the
yellow flag passing rule is for our races.  You get it, if at all, in the
driver's meeting.  Sometimes I have heard the SCCA formulation.  Other
times, I have heard something else, like:  until you can see a corner
station which is not showing a yellow flag.  I would hope we could
standardize.  I'd opt for the SCCA rule, as they have lots of experience
with it, but would happily settle for just always being on the same page.

last week getting his crankshaft back from the grinder's)
