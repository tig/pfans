Hi Wes,

I'm currently using the 80 compound for track use. I LOVE THEM.

I bought them from Bill Love at OG Racing. They advertise in Pano
and Excellence. Let me know if you need the number. I pay something
like $135 for the fronts. 

My first set lasted for 2 days at Bridgehampton, 2 days racing at Lime
Rock. Another 3 days at Bridgehampton, and 1 day of Pocono.  That's 8
days, and they still were usable at that point, but a little thin. I
had the Pocono club race and I didn't want to do that on old pads.

When the PF 80 pads are hot (like on the track) they are all of those
things. If you try to use them on the street, they will squeel,
grumble, and wear the rotors quickly.

I don't know, but I do know a few people who have stopped using Pagid
pads because they transfer pad material to the rotors.
