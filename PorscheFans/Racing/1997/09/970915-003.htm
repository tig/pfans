I find Dave I.'s opinion that driver aggressiveness is the cause of most 
Porsche racing damage (quoted below) intriguing.  The brief footages I've 
seen of the Carrera Cup, Super Cup, and other professional Porsche races, 
all involved a higher than normal amount of "carnage".  I wonder if this is 
a common thread in Porsche racing at every level, not just PCA?

haven't even dropped a wheel into the dirt, yet!

Common theme:  aggressive driving, not necessarily a lack of racing 
courtesy
or room by others. It may be getting more competitive, and at the front of
the pack things may be getting "closer", but there is still good racing,
willingness to give some room, and a lot of fun to be had.  BUT, you had
better be ready for your car to be a total loss -- more likely a result of
your own internal pressure, than that of others.  If that's uncomfortable,
its a potential fact of life -- whether in Club Racing or in "Driver's Ed"
on a high speed track.  (By the way, the "carnage" at Road America included
a few incidents in the driver's ed sessions, including a roll-over at Turn
13 with an instructor in the car.)
