Personally, I've been there and I decided to stick with the stock setup.
Yes, those hoses are expensive because they're a one year only thing.  Do
yourself a favor and don't look at the cost of replacing the tank.
However, how often do you have to replace these hoses?  My first set
seemed to have lasted over 20 years.  How does the cost of the hoses
compare to the cost of replacing the hoses and the tank with the later
system (although I suppose you could sell the old tank for a fair
amount).  It's your call, and I think an argument can be made either way.


Can you install the new tank so that you still don't have to open the
engine compartment to add oil or check the level?  I have to admit that I
always smile when I hear another 911 owner complain about how messy
adding oil is.

Also, I'm a bit suprised about your comment about having an oil cooler
mounted on the engine.  I haven't heard of this before, and am pretty
sure mine has no such cooler (or any cooler for that matter, but
hopefully that's getting taken care of in the next week or so).
