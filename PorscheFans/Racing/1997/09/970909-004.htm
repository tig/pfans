Guys,

Just got back from the Vegas PCA Club Race and had a ball.  The car broke
during the race but the competition was good and the racing safe and fun.
 Upon my return I found that a few friends had bounced copies of some recent
porschefans postings and some of this stuff necessitates a reply:

I know of no PCA Club Racing National Steward who tolerates passing under a
yellow flag.  None.  I have disqualified people, made people miss practice
sessions, sent people to the back for qualifying, and have not allowed people
to participate in racing because of passing under a yellow flag.  No one who
has ever raced where I was the steward could possibly misinterpret my stand
on this very important safety point.  I am, if anything, a fanatic about the
observance of flags.

Further, if a racer passed under yellow and it was reported by the corner
workers (at Pocono as elsewhere), that racer was black flagged.  According to
what Cal and Barry have written, there was some passing that was not reported
by the corner workers and if it isn't reported, the steward has no way to
know about it.  Still, the corner workers at Pocono were excellent (some of
the best I have worked with) and it is doubtful that they missed many such
occurrences.  Also, no racer (not one) complained to the steward after the
race about having been passed under yellow; as a steward, I want to hear
those complaints just after the race and at the event, not a month later.
 However, one of the non-racer, first-hand reports coming out of Pocono is
simply not true.

Jerry reports that timing and scoring was aware of "all passes under yellow,"
that they had "revised the scoring," that I told them to publish the original
standings and that "half the field would have been affected."  This is a
strange mix of fact and fiction and in every case it is incorrect.  (1) It is
not the job of timing and scoring to be aware of anything except what car
crosses the finish line, how fast it gets there, and, in a race, the
finishing order; and, in any event, their job is to do what the steward asks
them to do.  At Pocono timing was the "weak link" and it wasn't until
Saturday afternoon that we finally got them up to speed; part of the problem
was that they wanted to be involved in grid, corner working and control.  (2)
 They were not aware of what was going on under yellow, just of what they
thought was happening.  First, they wanted to disqualify a guy who made a
pass "under yellow" right  in front of the timing tower.  The corner workers
first reported the pass but then came back to qualify the report in that the
passing car had been signaled to pass by a car with mechanical problems.  As
always, when there is a question, I spoke to both the guy who did the pass
and the guy who had signaled him to pass to make sure that there had been a
signal and, of course, as such was the case, did not take away his earned
position.   Then, timing wanted to disqualify three guys who made passes
between the last corner (under yellow) and the start/finish line (checker
with no yellow).  These were legal passes (they were past the yellow flag
station, could see the checkered flag and, further, could see that there was
nothing wrong on the track between them and this next flag station.  (3)  It
is not the job of timing and scoring to revise anything until it has been
ascertained by the steward that there is something wrong with the original
standings  and then it is his job to have timing make the changes.  In this
case, there was nothing to change.  (4)  Four (4) racers were involved in
timing's "proposed" revision, not half the field.  And, in each and every
case they (timing) were out of their element, attempting to do someone else's
job, and more importantly,  they were wrong.

Jerry, the ex-racer, wasn't running at Pocono because "racing is getting far
too serious."  Well, I have a flash, sports fans, it was just as serious when
I raced at Second Creek six years ago as it is today.  The competition at
that race was tight and we all placed ourselves and our equipment in harm's
way just as we did yesterday at Las Vegas.  He is wrong when he writes that
13/13s were "unusual" in the early years; the number of 13/13 incidents has
remained almost exactly the same per race during each of the first five years
of the program.  He is wrong when he writes that "cheating in the stock
classes is the norm."  This year Harry and his crew have been checking into
motors, cams, compression, etc., etc. and they have been finding what most of
us suspected:  Cheating is a figment of the losers imagination.   The number
of people who are really trying to cheat is very, very small.  The number who
are accused of it because they drive well is much, much larger.

Perhaps you can forgive Jerry for his misconceptions in that he doesn't race,
but it is hard to believe that Bob Scotto and Barry Lenoble are the only
people who are on this list who know what the program is all about.  The
truth is that the vast majority of our members know the rules and abide by
them; most do not pass under yellow and most are out there for one reason and
that is to have fun.  The vast majority see cheating as stupid considering
what there is to gain.  At each and every event we have more participants
than we had the year before and more and more of our events are sold out.
 There are still far more "atta boys" and hugs than there is grumbling.  As a
matter of fact, I have seen more passing under yellow, frequency of incidents
and reported infractions on copies of last weeks PorscheFans than I've seen
at any of our races in a year.
