>        Hey all you wannabe highspeed dudes and dudettes,
>we are thinkin about doin the PE100 and would have room for 3 more cars on
Barney the transporter leavin God's country here in the northwest and
returning to same. You Porsche would make the trip in enclosed comfort and
arrive just as shiny as when you drove it onto Barney's tail and he lifted
it and we rolled it into his belly and secured it by the tires to his rib
cage ;-)
>   You could stay home and work and visit with the family, then just fly in
and race! Just like the big star race car drivers, arrive and drive ;-)
>   For a nominal fee we will haul you car to the site and back home in
complete comfort and have a cold drink in an air conditioned lounge waiting
for you when you get there to pick you car up. Think about it, you don't
have to stare at the highway for 4 days plus motel and wear and tear on you car.
>   Cost is about $.30 to $.35 per mile round trip. Now add up 4 days missed
work and the fuel and the two motels (1 down, 1 back) not to mention the
miles on your baby.

 BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
 or the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
