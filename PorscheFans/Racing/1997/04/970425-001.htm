Sorry if you got this twice, but the message I got back from the list
server indicates that this message did not go out to all list members.

I have a 1973 Targa that I am reluctantly putting up for sale.  The
car was originally a 911T, but it has been modified for drivers
education purposes.  Larger front and rear torsion bars.  I don't
recall the sizes, but I can get the information if you are interested.
The front has been updated to 87 Carrera brakes.  The motor has been
updated with the following parts.  Weber carburetors (40IDA), 2.2S
pistons, S cams, and ported heads with larger intake valves.  Less
then 30K since complete rebuild.  The front pan has been replaced and
sealed to prevent rust.  I have cleaned out and treated the battery
boxes to prevent corrosion.  There is an AutoPower PCA race approved
roll-bar.  5 point harnesses for both Recarro seats.  Chassis is
straight and rust free.  There are a few minor spots of surface rust.
The air conditioning is not in the car, but I have all the parts
necessary to re-install it.  The car has been garage kept for the past
two years.  I am asking $10,500 or best reasonable offer.  This is a
great car for a track junkie that does not want to put the excess wear
and tear on their everyday driver.

I also have a set of wheels for sale, pending sale of the car.  2
early 911 offset 15x6 Fuchs, and 2 (original) 911R 15x7 Fuchs.  I am
asking $1200 for the set.  I will not split the set.  Buy the whole
package, car and extra set of wheels for $11,000.

Pictures of the car can be seen on my web page.
www.magicnet.net/~johns/home.html  The car is in located Orlando FL.
Send inquiries to johns@magicnet.net or phone me during the day at
