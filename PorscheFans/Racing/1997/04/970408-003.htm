Scotty,  The dude owes you an apology.  Clear and simple.......Something like 
"OH, JEEZ, I'M REALLY SORRY!! THOUGHT I SAW A WINDOW THERE" or a simple  "I 
REALLY PULLED A BONEHEAD MOVE THERE"........ 
 
Maybe your best bet would've been your "Gone and found him and told him I was 
ready to listen to his apology?" course of action.  That way, you'd probably 
have some closure and I'm sure he woulda felt better too.....As ugly as SCCA 
racing can get, competitors usually are civil about these things as it is a 
racetrack and stuff happens........If he's running under the PCA banner, well, 
his failure to seek you out and say something is indefensible......
