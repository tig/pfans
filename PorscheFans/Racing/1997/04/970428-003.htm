Saturday was a beautiful day. Sunny, warm, a little windy, but not bad.
Out in the practice session, not too much happened. I warmed up the
car, the tires felt good. I ran easy laps in the 1:07 range. Next was
qualifying. 

The qualifying session was long, about 20 minutes. I got to the grid
late, and was last onto the track. I spent about 10 minutes passing cars,
then I got some clear track. I spend the last 5 minutes trying to run
down an 86 944T. I never did catch him. I would get close, but then I
would make a mistake and slide back. Eventually I gave up and just drove
some smooth, fast laps. I qualified 19, with a time of 1:05.628. The 
944 turbo I chased qualified 14th, with a 1:04.741. I thought I was a 
lot closer to him than that, but I guess 1.1 seconds isn't that long.

Lunch break, time to rest and think about the race.

Race time. On the false grid. Nervous, butterflies. Pull onto the
track.  I'm gridded on the outside. I just want to make a good clean
start. Two laps around the pace car. Down the hill, pace car pulls in.
I give up looking for the starter. I concentrate on going as soon as
the car in front of me goes, and remembering to shift at redline. We're
off! Hard on the throttle, smooth shift. Pull to the inside, get around
2 cars. Through big bend, watch out for cars on my left, stay to the
outside. I have a good line onto no name straight, and I'm racing. I've
been wanting to do this since before I had a driver's license, and now
it's for real! Down the hill, drift right out to the concrete. Fly down
the straight, hard on the brakes and early apex it into big bend. Slow
down for the second apex and then make the left and then the right onto
no name. I'm in clear track, no one close ahead of me, or right behind
me. This goes on for a lap or two. Then a white 993 appears behind me.
I try holding him off, but start driving poorly. I almost slide off the
track after west bend, and then again after the downhill. I can carry
more speed into big bend, but he's all over me through the esses. I
gain some distance in the uphill, but lose it all on the rest of the
track. One more lap and I scare myself by cooking it into big bend too
hard. We get onto no name straight, and I stay left and let him by. I
try to follow, relax, and drive better,

I watch the 911 start to hound the 944T from my qualifying battle. The
944T slips letting the 911 by, and I start to really catch him. We're
battling, when we come up on a GT6 914. The 911 that I battled with in
the fun race is now right on my bumper. So all three of us (944T, me,
911) pass the 914, but I'm slow doing it and damn, The 911 gets around
me!

There are about 10 laps to go. I try to catch back up to the 911, but
I'm pushing too hard, and lose even more ground. 5 laps to go. The
leaders appear in my mirror. I don't want to get in the way, so I wave
them by as I approach the left hander in the esses. Scary place to be
passed. The leaders go around me and I follow them onto no name
straight. I catch a major break when the leaders pass the 911 (that
I've been following) before the uphill, and I am right on his bumper.

I follow him through west bend and down the hill. He brakes early, and
I almost nail him. Then he gets onto the front straight, and pulls a
little ground. I catch up to him BIG TIME going into big bend. Again,
he brakes early, and I think I am going to hit him as I frantically try
to slow down. I feel my ABS start to pulse as his bumper gets bigger


and bigger. Finally, I slow enough and get back on the throttle. I know
know that all I have to do is stay close on the front straight, and I
can get him going into big bend. I drop back and then gain on the
uphill. Stay close through west bend. Drop back a little so I can go
all out down the hill. I do that and close up on his bumber onto the
front straight. I hear his exhaust bellow as he pulls away 1 then 2 car
lengths. As we cross start - finish I pull over to the middle of the
track to make my pass intention clear. The brake markers fly by on the
left, 5, 4, 3, he brakes, I wait a little and then brake, brake,
BRAKE.  I slam a lousy downshift to third and then hold on. I'm too hot
and drift wide of the apex. but I've got the line, and the 911 can't
turn inside me. I'm ahead (and still on the track) as we head into the
esses! The 911 is all over me as we head down no name, but I gain a
little on the uphill. Down the front straight, I'm in the lead. I go a
little slower into big bend. No pass attempt from the 911. I'm prepared
to give up the corner if he tries.

2 laps to go. I'm starting to gain on the 86 944 turbo in front of me, but
unless he makes a major mistake, I won't catch him. The 911 is all over me,
and I think I can hold him back there, but I want the race to be over.
We come up on a black 944 turbo. I recognize the car, and it's very slow.
In fact, I'm going to lap him. I'm approaching the black 944T on no name
straight. I really want to get by ASAP, because I'm afraid that if I
don't, the 911 will get both of us. I'm zooming down no name, into the
braking zone, I decide to make the pass now. I pull down to the inside,
slow and right before I start to make the turn, I see the 944 start to turn 
into me. Not good! I debate (in about a millisecond) if I should beep the
horn, and decide not to. I pull over onto the curbing, and then the
driver sees me and moves back to the left. I climb the hill and take off.
Last lap, uneventfull. As I make the downhill, I see another 911 behind me
and gaining quickly. It's one of the leaders, and I don't want to be
lapped by another car. I get a good run onto the straight, but he keeps
coming, and passed me by about 1 foot at the checker.

So I came in 14th out of 26, and 9th in class out of 14. I'm very happy.
Nothing broke, or went wrong. Slept like a baby, and had an easy trip home 
the next day.
