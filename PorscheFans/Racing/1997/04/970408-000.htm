        Hey P-car racers,
   I was just curious about how you experienced racers handle contact after
the incident. The story is I was at PIR last weekend and ran a PCA/scca grid
and then decided to run another SCCA class just for the seat time. I was
running Super Production against the likes of Monte Shelton and Gorden
Ledbetter with a portly stock class F 944S2 at 3100lb. I qualified just a
tenth behind a fellow named Mark Dickens from Utah in a GT3 (?) 2,000lb
200hp 944. I spanked him on the start and led him around the track by about
5 car lengths or more for the first 8 laps until a caution bunched us all up.
   When we went green again we were on the back stretch and heading towards
turn 7/8/9 a set of turns I have never seen anyone drive through more than
one wide, not even Micheal or Robby would try it here ;-) Anyway, as we head
in there I am following the guy (Jay Culbetson) that won the PCA grid with
laps about 4sec faster then mine and he is really tiptoeing thru 7/8 but I
am thinking there is no point sticking my nose in there because he's gonna
be gone as soon as he enters 9 (leads onto the front straight) so I am being
patient and just about the time I have the throttle rolled towards the
carpet at the apex of 9 (jay is gone now), WHAM!! This rascal Mark drives up
on the grass with the inside wheels and clobbers me in the right rear
wheelwell/quarter and sends me to the turn nine wall!!
   I am flailing around trying desperately not to meet the wall and with a
good dose of luck I manage to get back under control and continue only
losing 2 positions and suffering body/wheel damage. I gotta tell you it's a
damn good thing he got past me so he could run those 3/10ths per lap slower
times in front of me instead of behind me ;-)
   Anyway, I had 12 more laps to think about how I should handle this little
incident and decided to pull along side during the cool down and shake my
finger at him in shame, NO not my middle finger, my index finger,  sheeze
you guys ;-) We had to stop a few times on the way back to the pits and Mark
Dickens stayed back about 20 car lengths every time we stopped, wonder how
he thought I was going to handle it ;-)
   The moral of the story is, I was commended for not making the corner
workers have to re-stack all the tires in turn 9 and he was DQ'd and
reprimanded. He never came over to say he was sorry or say screw you or
anything ;-( I was not hard to find as I put our car up on the lift and
raised it high in the air so he could find me to talk about it. I also did
not throw any fits or yell or call him names, not even to any of my friends,
so he shouldn't have been thinking I was irrational or anything. I just
don't get it why he didn't come over and say something :-/
   Sooooooooo the question is, did I do the right thing? Should I have
punched him in the nose? Talked about his mom? Bought him a beer? Offered to
pay for his damage? Gone and found him and told him I was ready to listen to
his apology? What? How do you experienced guys handle a situation like this?
The steward was amazed at how stupid his move was that caused the contact.

   Lemmy no,

,  

 BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
 or the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
