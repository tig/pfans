<< 
 I have always thought that the camber at the exit helps determine
 whether to take as a single or double apex.  When the exit is
 "on-camber", the corner can sometimes be taken as a single-apex; when it
 is "off-camber" (or slippery, or wet), I usually take it as a
 double-apex.n  The reasoning is that with a double-apex, the cornering
 load is not as high at the track-out point, giving better grip to start
 accelerating.  As usual, though, let your own rump be your guide!
  >>
You're far too technical for me! I find that the rump and exit speed are the
best tools although your logic sure sounds right. You also have to consider
setting up for the next corner. As you know sometimes you can come out of a
corner too hot and screw up the next corner. A series of ESSes is the best
example of that. Miss the first and there goes the lap !
