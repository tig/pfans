You did almost the right thing. You should NEVER physically or verbally
punish a bonehead for being a bonehead, cause SCCA WILL spank you pretty
hard, Up to and including termination of membership for physical attacks.

You Could have protested him Under SCCA GCR 20.1.4 and 20.1.7, reckless and
ddangerous driving and unsportsmanllike conduct. This would have resulted
(had it been upheld) in basically EXACTLY the same penalties as you
indicated he received. Obviously, the Stewards of the Meet filed a request
for action based on the corner reports, and penalized him on their own.

Remember, this is SCCA and a little contact is not unheard of. They tend to
overlook legitamite "racing incidents" but DO get on people for
stupid/dangerous stuff. I have found that really reckless drivers tend to
get "eliminated" over time, but you always need to be carefull.
