I have been unable to locate old stock slicks the size which will fit the
old 914 fenders without more body work (size 23x8.5x15).  the new tires
even the 8 inch size has a cross section of 10.3 inches.  My old tires are
only 9.5 inches  wide.  Should I forget the slicks and go with 225 R1
tires.  Any opinions on slicks vs R1's?  Any thoughts on the BFG 225x50 vs
the Hoosiers 225x45 (lower profile)?  I contacted John Berget (very nice
fellow) as suggested by Henry Hoeh and Bill Newlin (thanks for advice), but
John can only supply the new 8 or 9 inch tires with the wider cross
sections.  He was even willing to ship me one tire to  try.  But after
measuring what space there is left under the rear, I am convinced that the
new tires will rub unless I go to a body shop to push the rear out some
more.  the new tires may also force me to use another spacer to clear the
inside which will cause more stress on the rear suspension.

Any wisdom on subject is appreciated.
