   Hey all you cone mashers,
if anyone cares I have a little story to tell about our recent trip to sunny
Sacramento on..... yeah, you guessed it, EASTER SUNDAY! It was the first
Easter we were going to be away from our wonderful children and be on the
road for 15hrs each way in Barney the purple transporter. What for you ask?
Why, to better ourselves at our favorite sport, of course.
   As we pulled out of Portland Sunday morning at 11am (which was supposed
to be 9pm the night before but LiNay and I could not stand it and had to
stay for the egg hunt Sunday morning) we were talking about how we hoped we
were doing the right thing missing Easter and work and some school for the
girls and all to attend an A/X school of all things? I mean after all we are
not horrible drivers and have even done ok at a few national A/X events and
won a handful of road races and circle track races and LiNay was one of the
picks to win her class last year at nats, but could we learn that much and
was it worth it, and we sure hoped we would learn SOMETHING significant.
   Well we made it down there by midnight Sunday and could not find a place
to park Barney anywhere till 2am, only to get up at 6am to get ready for the
school. And I gotta tell you that by noon we had learned at least 3 HUGE
things each! We were elated! Jean Kinser caught me doing something I swore I
would never be caught dead doing as I have thrashed many students of mine
including the lovely and talented LiNay for committing this horrible offence
of car control! :-{} (shock) All I could think of was that learning just one
of those three things I learned that morning would be worth the trip. And it
only got better in the afternoon!
   The way I look at it is when you first start, your learning curve is more
or less vertical and then after you get to a certain level it flattens out
rather steadily ;-( So if I could learn just ONE huge thing to help me a
couple tenths on a given course that would be HUGE! Two tenths on one course
would have had me win the Seattle national tour last year by two tenths over
Curt Ormiston, two tenths per course last month in San Berdoo would have
made me 3rd instead of 6th ;-( YessirreeeBOB :-) One huge thing to learn
giving me 2/10ths would be worth it for sure!
   Did I get the two tenths? Well let me tell you about Jim McKamey's last
suggestion to me right before my last run at the end of the day after
driving the same course maybe 35 times. I changed one more thing at Jim's
request and took SIXTH TENTHS off of my previous best time on a 30 second
course!!! Jim and Jean have an uncanny way of misdirecting you into being
focused on things just at the right time and to leave you thinking about the
right things all the time, I am not sure what the formula is but I am here
to tell you it works, and IT WORKS AWESOME!!
   Now for some real time put the techniques to work numbers at home. Last
Sunday at Kent we had the first regional SCCA event where we have a few
mildly talented drivers you might have heard of once or twice, uhhhh....
like Joe Geocke & Bill Buetow who I have never been even close to in pax,
EVER! Well here is how the numbers went on Sunday:

Bill Buetow = 48.7 X AS pax of .832 = 40.518
Joe Goecke  = 48.9 X BS pax of .816 = 39.902

   Now some of mine here is woulda shoulda coulda stuff but I'll give it to
you both ways because Jim & Jean say it will take a while to apply all we
learned to every course and I am also counting on a class change for our
"poor ol yella wreck of an ASP Corvette" ;-) I am sure you all know that it
wasn't a Corvette that set the ASP pax standard ;-) And also I was not able
to apply everything I learned until the 5th run (#2 fun run). My 4th run
(1st fun run) matched my 3rd run (last competition run) while getting
settled in the car and warming up the tires. So here goes.

Scotty B 3rd run = 47.421 X ASP pax of .861 = 40.811
Scotty B 3rd run = 47.421 X BSP (I hope next year) of .852 = 40.403 (now I
beat Bill)
Scotty B 5th run (all McKamey skills applied) = 46.8 X ASP pax of .861 =
40.295 (beat him again)
Scotty B 5th run (all McKamey skills applied) 46.8 X next years BSP pax of
..852 = 39.874!

   So if I was able to put all the skills together at the first A/X after
the school by my third run and if the car was classed fairly then the end
result would be that I kicked Joe's ASS!!! ;-) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...... if only
I lived in a woulda shoulda coulda perfect world ;-) But even the way it
actually was with no woulda shoulda coulda and no next years pax I feel
pretty damn good being 3/10ths behind the likes of Billy Bigtoe in pax while
I am driving a model of car that has never enjoyed better than a 5th place
finish in it's class at nats ;-) 
   BTW LiNay elected to run a brand new set of unshaved unscrubbed tires for
her runs that probably didn't start to work till her third run and she still
killed her class (open ASP) by almost a second with a 48.1!
   Is the McKamey school worthwhile? LiNay and I swear by it and will take
it again for sure. We never spent a couple hundred bucks apiece so wisely on
autocross before ;-)

   Oh, BTW one disclaimer, Jim told us this school won't do you any good at
all if you drive anything in BSP. And it won't do you any good in ASP unless
you drive a yella Corvette. ASP Lotus' and Porsches don't count even if they
are wannabee yella (hi curt). So if you fit into one of those categorys,
don't bother signing up as it will be a waste of time and money ;-) REALLY!!

,
BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
that important, now could it? ;-) white)
