Hello,

As the subject line says, this is the story of my first PCA club race,
the Racing Into Spring event at Lime Rock Connecticut.

In order to try and keep this short (something that's almost impossible
for me), I'll try to stick to the basics and not ramble too much. Forgive
me if I do ramble, and you can delete this anytime.

For me, the event started thursday afternoon when I left my house at
3:00.  I had to be at LRP at 6:30 for the rookie driver meeting. The
trip to LRP was uneventful, and I registered at about 5:50. I was able
to quickly get through tech inspection and then the rookie meeting. As
I set up my site in the paddock, I was initimidated by the amount and
quality of the cars at the event. I expected LRP to be empty thurdsay
night, but it was packed.  If a business was located on the east coast,
and advertised in Pano, they were at LRP on Thursday. RACE, Dougherty,
Windward, GT Racing, EPE, Autosport, Stable Energies, Formula
Motorsports, you name it, they were there.

I saw big rigs unloading cars right and left.  There I was in my
totally stock 944 turbo that I drove to the event; it was quite a
surprise. In checking the event schedule, I was that I was in race
group 3, comprised of unlimited cars (no limit to amount of
preparation) in groups GT5 and GT6 and stock cars in class C, D, E. I'm
in class E. Since this was my first race, I figured I would run in the
back of the field. Now I find that my class should be the slowest class
in the group. That should mean that I do a LOT of checking in my
mirrors, and should not have to do a lot of passing. I went to sleep
that night with dreams of being run over.

I woke up Friday morning to the sound of air cooled motors warming up.
Now that I think about it, that's a better sound than my alarm clock. I
got the car set up early, and went to the driver meeting. The race
director, CR (don't ask me to spell or speak his name) told us "I bet
at the driver meeting, most of you are used to hearing 'this is not
racing, it's driver education.' Well, this is not driver education,
it's racing!" That really got my blood pumping. I walked back to my
paddock space, and my crewman had arrived. I really have to say thanks
to Mike Russel, who drove all the way down from Vermont just to help me
out. At driver ed events, I do everything myself.  At the race, I
really needed some one to help take lap times, tire temps, tire
pressures, etc. Mike did an excellent job, and his help really meant a
lot to me. The price for his services was lunch,  you can't get a
better deal than that!

Anyway, back to the track. First practice session. Get on the false
grid early. See a bunch of people I know from DE events. Grid marshal
give the 5 minute sign. In the car, put in window net, strap on
harnesses, pull on balaclava, get gloves on. Start car and try to
relax. Grid marshalls give 1 minute whistle.  Head onto the track.
Yellow flag for two laps, then the green comes out. I know LRP pretty
well, having driven there more than 5 times. I remember the track and
start to drive the DE line. I'm taking it easy, trying to warm up
mentally and physically. With the window net, I can't see out my left
mirror very well, and I can't reach my arm out to dive signals.  This
is going to be interesting. I'm pretty nervous, and not driving very
well. I watch the cars come up behind me, and when they get close, I
drive on my line, and the cars pass wherever they can.

After a few minutes I head into the pits. Mike adjusts the pressures,
and I head back out. I feel a lot better, and now I start to realize
that driving is driving; I know how to drive, so I should be OK. The
car works better, I'm not in traffic, and I start to enjoy myself. I
come up on some of the low HP cars (GT5 and GT6 914's) and I actually
pass them. It's a lot of fun to be able to pass anywhere, and not have
to wait for a signal. Before I know it, the checker flies, and the
session is over. I drive back to my spot and take tire temps and
pressures. We adjust the pressure some more, and then review lap
times.  I've been driving easy, and the lap times show it, in the 1:08
range.  Not fast, but I don't care. Even better, I didn't get blown
into the weeds. Sure, I got passed a lot, but I can drive with these
guys, and not be dangerous.

Second session - I start to drive harder. The car is great. I start to
push it, and feel great doing it. I'm running with a pack of 3 other cars,
two 944 TS, and 1 911. We're all pretty even. Passing these guys is NOT 
easy. I'm second, behind the 911 and ahead of the 2 944 TS's. I can tell
that the car behind me is faster than I am, but he can't (or more
likely isn't really trying to) get by. I'm probably a little faster than
the car in front of me, but I don't know where to pass. He can pull away
from me (by a little) down the front straight, but I am faster through
big bend. He's much faster through the esses, but I'm a LOT faster making
the right that leads up the hill. I'm also faster on the downhill that
leads onto the front straight. I follow him for two laps and then I 
decide to try a pass at the end of the front straight. I follow him down
the front straight, then move to the inside to make my intent to pass
clear. As we start to brake, I see he locks his inside rear wheel, so
the pass is very easy. The 944 TS behind me also passes, now I have to
try to keep him back there. We go around for another lap, then on the
front straight I see a fast 914 behind the 944 behind me. I go through
big bend, and start to make the left for the esses. I'm starting to
turn in when I hear a motor just on my left. It's that 914! I never
even saw him. I didn't think he got around the 944, then all of a
sudden he was just there! A scary moment.  I make a note to be even more
aware of all the cars.

I find Mike in the pits and we go over lap times. Much better, down
to high 1:06, low 1:07, best lap of 1:06.67. When I drove at LRP last, my
best laps were in the 1:05 range, so I know I can go a little faster.
I just have to figure out how.

Third session was like the second. Find some people to race with. The car
is not sticking as well as before, and the lap times are little slower,
most in the 1:07 - 1:08 range. We lower the pressure some more.

Now it's time for the practice starts. All rookies must participate, it's
optional for others. I'm gridded 14th of 24, so I'm mid pack, much better
than I anticipated. We are to form up behind the pace car, do a warm up lap,
come down the front straight. If the green is flown, we are to race until 
the uphill turn, and then get back in line, and do another start. After
the third start, there will be a ten lap fun race.

I'm gridded on the outside. We follow the pace car around the track and 
then down the hill. I can't see the starter, and then everyone takes
off. I floor it and stay in line. We go into big bend, and I can't get
to the inside because there are too many cars. So I stay on the outside
and drive around 2 cars. We make the left and I'm in a better position,
so I get another place. Then we form up again. I'm on the outside again.
I'm looking for the starter, when again, everyone takes off. This time
I don't get a good jump, and 3 cars get by me. I move over to the inside
because I want to give that side a try. We come down the straight. I
am looking for the starter, and there it is, the green flag. I stand on
it and take off. I pull to the inside and start to pass a car when
brap brap brap brap, my car won't pull anymore. I look down, and I'm
bouncing off the rev limiter. In the stress, I forgot to shift. I
grab the next gear and stay tight. I get around the car I was trying
to pass, and now the fun race is for real.

I passed one car during the race. Then when we encountered traffic, he
got around me when I got hung up with a slower car. I have a lot to learn
when it comes to dealing with traffic. I can handle chasing down a car, 
or being chased, but I seem to lose a lot of ground when either the faster
cars pass me, or I pass the slower cars. Anyway, I finished the fun race
in something like 15 place. The 10 laps seemed like a long time when
I was driving it. Especially since I spent the last 4 laps trying to hold
off the 911 from before.

That's it for Friday.
