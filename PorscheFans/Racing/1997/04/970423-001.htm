Hi All,

I currently have a 356 which I feel quite comfortable working on and I love
to drive.  I really want to race and I've been considering vintage racing
for a some time, though I don't want to race my current car.

I am considering a 1950s era, fiberglass bodied car called a Devin, built
on a correct middle 50s 356 chassis.  The only thing not Porsche on the car
is the body.

Is there a class in PCA racing, time trials or autocross that I could enter
this car?  There are a lot of after-market fiberglass pieces on race cars,
this one is just taken to the extreme...

I'd bet I wouldn't be particularly competitive, but would there be a place
for me?

Thanks,

Clark
