Ezra,

Don't give up on the idea of sneakers.

I have had good results with sailing athletic shoes, built by Harken.=20
They are close fitting but accomodate wide feet better than most auto
racing shoes.  The grip on the pedals is very good without "dragging".
Best of all, they wear well in the pits, paddock, etc.  Price is ~
$65-75 at marine wholesalers like West Marine, etc.=20
