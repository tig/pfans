First a little background; bear with me...

During the 70s and 80s my father owned a series of Porsches, a 912, a 
914/6 (which eventually sported a 3.0 RSR spec motor, and it was his 
street car), a 911SC, and a 928S.  Hence my crippling Porsche addiction 
(a '75 911S).

Well since then Dad's fallen from the path.  After a few years of driving 
a souped up 3000GT, he's gone and purchased a brand new Vette.  These new 
Vettes sound like real nice cars, and Dad's pretty excited about it.  He 
wants me to come visit him, and take the car to an autocross, show him 
what it can do.

So now we get to my little problem: Dad's in Ohio, I'm in California; he 
doesn't autocross, and isn't in touch with the local clubs.  I've decided 
to take a trip out there as a birthday present for him.  I'm looking for 
an autocross in the greater Cleveland area sometime in late August or 
early September.  We obviously need to be able to enter the Vette, and 
the event needs to be open to non-members of whatever club is hosting it. 
 I'd really like to find an event where I can take dad along as a 
passenger, and vice-versa (I'm an autox instructor in the local PCA 
scene).  

I'd appreciate any leads anyone can give me.
