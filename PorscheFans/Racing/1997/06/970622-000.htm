The smell of burned rubber will not be the only thing that shall
remember me of june 22nd, 1997. I did my first slalom today at
PCA Germany Region, which i'm now - big thanks to Jim Moder of
the 924-944 list - a member of.

Wow! What a day. Having the chance to check my car's limits and
handling was something i were dreaming of for a long time. And
now, just one week after replacing my 924 S with my newly
purchased 944 S2, this dream finally became true! Those cornering
speeds! I never had believed how fast this car can be driven
through curves - it's just amazing. Reading other peoples reports
about racing is very interesting but doing it yourself is the
best. Understeering, oversteering, ABS controlled braking - now i
know how it feels.

And all this happened on a course where it is nearly impossible
to damage yourself or your car - even if you loose total control
over your car as i did once... spinning around in a big blue cloud
fed by four yelling Pirelli P700Z tires.


In short: This was MY day. Nice people, great P-cars, fine weather,
a very good organized event and well, one driver with a sunburn
and much room for improvements ;-) But he had fun and learned a
lot about his new S2.

I can't await the next slalom event!
