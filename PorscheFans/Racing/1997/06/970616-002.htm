I spent last weekend at a driver ed event at Gingerman.  I was driving an
84 Carrera on 225 and 245 R1s with stock brakes using Pagid orange pads.
Under very hard braking the steering wheel would vibrate (oscillating back
and forth as with very small, rapid steering inputs).  Any ideas on the
cause?  There was no vibration in the pedal (which I would expect if the
rotors were warped) and no steering wheel oscillation under moderate to
hard braking.  Oscillations seemed to get worse during a session and as the
weekend progressed.    There is still plenty of material left on the pads.
Thanks in advance.
