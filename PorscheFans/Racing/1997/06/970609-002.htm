Howdy,

Went to a practice day yesterday at auto-x.  I was fortunate enough to meet some
of the p-fans list members.  Ross Parker and his brother in law came out.  They
learned very quickly what brand new race rubber feels like (two big, big tail
slides).  The course was very, very tight and very technical.  Paul and I felt
that our lines were pretty good.  Only one corner had to be adjusted throughout
the day to go a bit quicker, but no matter what we did, the turbo lag hindered
our progress pretty bad.  I was so frustrated at the end that I got one of the
long time senior drivers who had one of the fastest times in his own car to
drive mine and he came in 1/10th slower than me.  I tried everything, up shift
down shift, early throttle, late throttle, nothing made any difference, same
time each time.  There was one corner where I kept making the same mistake over
and over again, going in too fast and understeering out.  After six runs, you'd
think I'd have slowed down earlier before entering, but it just sucked me in
each time!

Paul drove his absolute heart out, really, really pushing the S-02s to their
limits.  When I saw his run, I knew he wasn't going any faster all day and
he really didn't.  There just wasn't anymore to come from the car.

Wes did a screamer run in the morning group, but then never managed to take
that run, work on it and make it faster.  I don't think he managed to match
that time in the afternoon group.

Next weekend, the course is much larger, so hopefully, there will be enough
room to actually use some of the turbo power.

I'll give you some times to compare:

Driver			Car		Time		Tire
Wes Shew		91 944 S2	1:09.5		BFG R1
Harry Dether		89 Carrera	1:10.0		BFG R1
Farzaan Kassam	89 951		1:10.2		Hoosier
Paul Buchmann		89 951		1:10.8		Potenza S-02

Paul actually managed a 1:10.4 scratch time, but hit a few cones.  Now, here 
comes the sad part.  There was a new Boxster out with sport suspension and 17"
tires and the twin turbo terror was out too.  Both of the new generation Porsches
really make my 89 951 feel like an 8 year old car.  Those cars are so tuned,
it's ridiculous how fast they are on street tires.  Check out these
times:

Driver			Car		Time		Tire
Robert Lu		97 Boxster	1:09.8		Pirelli PZero
Robert Lu		96 993 TT	1:07.0		Potenza S-02

Now, it's a given that Robert Lu is a Nationals calibre driver, having trophied
two out of three times he went to the US Nationals, but still, 1:07 on 
street tires!  The new gen Porsches look so tight and well controlled, whereas
our 944's looked like they were falling over and dying.  Paul and my car's
air dams were scraping the ground as we rounded the sweeper.  Wes probably
suffered the same embarrassment.  Our car's technology just felt old 
yesterday :(

What is the going market price for a 94 911 3.6 Turbo?

Minnam Racing is getting their DynoJet training on Wednesday which means they
will book us in the next spot available after Wednesday.  I will likely pass on
this weekend as there is an important event on Sunday and don't want to break
the car on Saturday.  I'll likely leave the dynoday to some time next week in
the evening.  So far, their highest HP reading was a 93 RX-7 TT with a single
turbo Greddy upgrade.  It put out 360hp to the rear wheels and singed the wall
when they shifted from 3rd to 4th with a 3 ft. flame!

Farzaan.
