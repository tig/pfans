America and will
influence the FIA on worldwide issues.

ions

affecting rules stability and cost containment," said Lee Carducci of
Chrysler Corporation, who
also serves on the FIA Manufacturers' Council. "Through this process,
decisions on sporting

very excited about the breadth of participation by manufacturers represen=
ted

r

"Through
these series, manufacturers will have a place to race the technology that
they sell in their
road-going cars," said Joe Negri, GM Motorsports.
"A strong new fan base is developing throughout the world for sports car
racing.
Manufacturers, television and consumer-brand companies are joining togeth=
er

terrific package for our sports car fans in 1998 and beyond," added Evans.
"This is an exciting
time for sports car racing, and common rules with the rest of the world w=

only make a good
situation better," commented Erik Wensberg, M Brand Manager of BMW of Nor=
th
