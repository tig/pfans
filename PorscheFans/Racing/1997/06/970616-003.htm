Just got back from the Parade Club Race. How come I can never remember to
use sun block during these things, when I'm waxing the car, etc. Oh well,
evolution in action. The race was great! Everything is going to be great
to me, of course, since I'm pretty much a novice but I was much more
prepared for things this time compared to my time at Hallet last fall. I
actually got to meet a few people this time (George B., Bruce Anderson,
and Jason Burkett). It turns out Jason and I watched the race together but
didn't realize who the other was until yesterday. Briefly, there were
three races with various classes racing in each one which means you have a
lot of races within the races. It can get confsing very fast. I don't
think there were any 13-13 violations at this one but there were a few
spins off the track. There was one incident that could've been tragic but
turned out sort of humorous; there was a car entered for fun i.e. it
wasn't a Porsche so it couldn't officially run in the race. It was a tube
frame Indy type car powered by a 968 engine. It was very fast but seemed a
little twitchy throughout the whole weekend. It was in Group 1, the last
race. The cars got on the track and went around for the first lap.
Apparently, just as George through the flag to start, one of the wheels
came off this car and went bounding down the track. This happened on the
other side of the track from me so I didn't see what caused the whole
thing. But, and here's the strange part, it didn't seem to faze the driver
much. He just kept on going. By the time he got around to me on the other
side of the track, he was still leading the race! On three wheels. Yeah.
That's what I think, too. Fortunetly, no one was hurt but there was a
little temper flaring after the race. The s.o. went with me for the Parade
laps (a first). I was told the speed limit was 50 mph. I didn't violate
it; neither did I do less than 50. She was screaming and yelling and
hitting my arm as we went through the curves at 50. Some things that were
not so good; it was hot. I mean, Africa-hot. Really hot. I was also hoping
for more "goodies" to buy but there were only two small tables set up
selling Porsche stuff. I imagine that all the real good items are sold at
Parade itself. I was disappointed that the event t-shirts weren't for sale
to the fans. But, all in all, I had a wonderful time. Evene the s.o. was
blown away. Okay, enough of stream of consciousness reporting. Below are
the actual results of the race:

Oh yeah, the track is 1.8 miles in length and there were 18 laps in each
race for a total of 32.4 miles. I'll post the results of the other two
races in a separate post. My fingers are tired! Thanks go to the Lone Star
Region for putting on a great race! I had an awesome time, thanks ya'll!
