After watching Speedvision on Saturday, I had to miss the final hours Sunday
morning (US) for the final race results and had difficulty finding
information on why the #25 and #26 factory GT1's dropped out.  After
searching the "gleeful" (and well-done) BMW AG site, I finally went back to
the Porsche site for the articles by Pete Albrecht and colleagues on the
"sad" results of the crash and fire in the later hours of the race.

Incidentally, our local paper had nothing other than the top 5 standings and
a search thru the Web under Yahoo with the byline of SportsTicker Enterprises
produced the following ERRONEOUS content under their headline:

"Joest TWR teams captures second straight Lemans championship" (OK...
followed by the second paragraph..."The Nissan Prototype class entry crossed
the finish line handily in charge of its class and the overall event.
 Drivers Michele Alboreto of Italy...brought the team
home"....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (you can send your corrections to:
sports-beta@yahoo.com)

Wonder who proofs these articles?   Perhaps Pete can tell us what these
writers did over the long night?

Sadly, as a Porsche model seller, it looks like for the forthcoming year
we'll have to sell the Minichamps BMW-McLarens instead of getting "double
duty" out of last year's #25 and #26 GT1 cars....:((
