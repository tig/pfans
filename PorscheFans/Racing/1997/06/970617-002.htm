	[snip] Actually, I don't think I said that. I think the 968
	is a great car. I think it looks wonderful, too. A 968T placed
	second overall at the Parade Club Race, in fact. This was the
	first 968T in North America that I'd heard of. It was garaged
	with a Rothman's Challenge 951. Both beautiful cars. I noticed
	that they both had Rennsport stickers on their bumpers. Isn't
	the Rennsport guy on here? I think his name is Steve? Steve, can
	you tell us anything about these two way cool cars??
