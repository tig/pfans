Hello,

I am running PF 80 pads, and I have not had any problem with warped or
cracked rotors. I have an an 89 951, so my front rotors and calipers are
larger, so that might be the difference. I have driven on the track for 
more than 30 minutes without any signs of brake fade or rotor warp.

The rotors are showing signs of wearing, and will probably be worn out
after 1 or 2 more events. FYI, these rotors are probably original. The
car has 56K miles, and I've done over 35 track days (the first 25 or so
on Repco MetalMasters).
