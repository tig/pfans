For all Porsche racers who ever thought about running in SCCA, but could not
find a class.

SCCA is seriously considering re-aligning their national classes. This is a
move that would allow 993's to run in what is now showroom stock, 993's,
early 3.4 to 3.6 911's, 968's, and 944S2's to run in GT and Production AND
BE COMPETATIVE!!!

The only problem is that there are a number of "special interests" who are
big fish in thier little pond in a 1955 whatever. THEY are very vocal, and
have swayed the SCCA board in the past because nobody in favor of a move
made any noise.

I urge everyone who races any Porsche to send a letter similar to the one I
have included below. If they get several hundred letters from potential new
members, it will have a very large impact.

Thanks for your support.

Dear Sirs:

I am writing in support of the new Touring Class concept that you are
considering as a replacement for Showroom Stock.. As I understand it, it
would be a number of classes, numbered  T1, T2, etc. T1 would be the top end
class, with cars like the Dodge Viper, Ram Air firebird, Corvette and
Porsche 993 being classed. Competition adjustments involving restrictor
plates and ballast would be used to make the faster cars competitive with a
"baseline" car, and the slower cars in the class would get limited
enhancements to make them competitive. The rest of the rules would be
similar to the current touring rules.

This format would allow a lot of manufacturer input and support, since it
would allow a car that is uncompetitive in showroom stock  to be competitive
again. Companies that can not produce a "Neon ACR", designed almost
specifically for racing could either manufacture or select aftermarket parts
as approved "options", i.e. shocks and springs, exhaust, etc.. This would
certainly spark the interest of the OEM's.

I specifically like the chance to race the newest generation  Porsche's in
an SCCA National class, on a competitive basis. For the past several years I
have looked for a National class that didn't require me to:
A) Be Dave Finch and race a car that was developed with factory money, or B)
race an obsolete 20+ year old car against other obsolete 20+ year old cars.

If this change would be the basis for realigning GT, Production Touring and
IT so that a single car can progress through all of the classes it would set
the course for the next several generations. I realize that a number of GT
and production drivers would be upset because "THEIR" car was being put at a
disadvantage, but unless this is done SCCA might as well change it's name to
SVRA. Besides, with the proper adjustments, the current GT and Production
cars would remain competitive. You might want to consider an absolute car
age cap for National racing, like 20 - 25 years.

Again, the Touring Class concept has my total support.

Thank you for your time.
