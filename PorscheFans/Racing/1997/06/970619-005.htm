A week or two ago I heard that A.J.Foyt punched out Arie Luyendyk
(sorry for
the misspelling Arie).

Does anyone know why he did this and what the circumstances were. 
Just curious,
that's all.

Naweed.

It was all over the news.  Foy's boys had finished numbers one and two
in the race.  The only problem was that Luyendyk contended that the
scorers had missed two of his laps, and that he was actually the
winner.  Wanting to make sure everyone knew this as soon as possible,
Luyendyk stormed into the winner's circle to steal some of Foyt's
thunder, ranting and raving about how he had actually won the race..  At
this point, Foyt popped him (film at 11 was great).  As it turned out, much
to the chagrin of the officials, Luyendyk was correct, the IRL corrected
it's mistake a few days later, and Luyendyk was given the win.  Even
though he was right, however, probably not the best way to deal with
the situation.

Now, I hear Foyt has the winner of the upcoming Tyson-Holyfield fight! 
To paraphrase the slogan of the fledgling WNBA, "Foyt got next!"
