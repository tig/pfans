Hi Mike,
  I had a similar failure with my 86 944 a number of years ago (4 or 5, I think). The
failure in my transaxle was one of the pinion teeth broke off and subsequently
thrashed the rest of the transaxle as I came to a stop. Unlike yours, though, my
case cover did not crack. Their were rumors that the materials used in the ring and
pinion were faulty, but I was unable to substantiate them. This does seem to be
one of the higher rate of failure items for the 86 944. My solution was to contact
Kempton Brothers in Florida and they shipped me a rebuilt unit with a guarantee. 

Good Luck
Tony
