Subj:    Panoz Sets to Win Le Mans!

    America's First Serious Contender in Three Decades Challenges Europeans
          LE MANS, France, June 13 /PRNewswire/ -- On June 14, 24-Hour Le
Mans hosts
its strongest American challenger in 30 years.
          The Panoz GTR 1 is backed by a commitment to sidetrack European
teams' FIA
GT Racing Le Mans dominance.  The Panoz GTR 1, in accelerated development
by the Panoz Motor Sports team since January 1996 and featuring the best of
European-inspired American technology, is the only American entry in Le
Mans, with three cars qualified.
          Debuting in SportsCar at Sebring in 1997, the Panoz GTR 1 won the
pole and
set three track records.  The car then sped to victories in the Grand Prix
of Atlanta at Road Atlanta and First Union Six Hours of the Glen at Watkins
Glen, N.Y., the latter occurring on June 1 and a great stepping stone to Le
Mans.  Enticing famed driver/actor Paul Newman out of retirement for Lime
Rock, the car set a track record and captured second place.  What's quite
remarkable, these have been the Panoz GTR 1's only SportsCar races!
Further, the Panoz GTR 1 won the pole at Silverstone, England, in FIA GT
Racing.
          Automotive manufacturer Panoz Automotive Development Company,
headquartered in Hoschton, Ga., near Atlanta, and of which Panoz Motor Sports
is a division, produces the Panoz GTR 1.
          Panoz Automotive's Dr. Donald E. Panoz, chairman, and Danny Panoz,
president and COO -- father and son respectively -- teamed premier chassis
developer and aerodynamics specialist Reynard Special Vehicle Projects and
champion engine builder Roush Racing for the first time to help build the
Panoz GTR 1.  Also involved in the design and development of the Panoz GTR
1 were DAMS Racing and David Price Racing, both of which provide race team
development.
          "McLaren and Porsche have dominated Le Mans for years, building a
tested
foundation for developing championship race cars.  It's a bold step for a
small American automotive manufacturer to viably challenge their dominance,
let alone be the only American entry for GT-1," says Dr. Panoz.
          The Panoz GTR 1, which evolved from the Panoz AIV Roadster, is
powered by
a small-block 302 Ford V8 engine with an X-trac gearbox.  "The Panoz GTR 1's
phenomenal cornering capabilities are due to Reynard's unique design, which
incorporates front-engine placement, a first in endurance racing in 30
years," says Dr. Panoz.
          At Le Mans, the Panoz Motor Sports team is led by racing veteran
Jean-Paul
Driot, team manager, of France-based DAMS Racing, and U.K.'s David Price
Racing, last year's sports car team champion.  DAMS is running one Panoz
GTR 1, and David Price the other two.  Piloting the three cars will be a
stable of champion drivers:  Andy Wallace, Perry McCarthy, Doc Bundy, David
Brabham, James Weaver and Butch Leitzinger for David Price, with Eric
Bernard, Frank Lagorce and J. Boullion heading up the French effort.
          The driving team of Wallace, Weaver and Leitzinger won the '97
Daytona 24
Hours.  Bundy and Wallace shared the duties when the Panoz GTR 1 won its
American homecoming at Road Atlanta, a notable feat for the car because
this track is also owned by Panoz Automotive.
          Panoz Motor Sports is racing up to four cars in FIA GT Racing and
up to
two cars in the American SportsCar.  The U.S. drivers are Wallace, Bundy,
Jeff
Purner and Bernard.
          "Our European teams qualifying three cars for Le Mans and getting
the
front row at Silverstone alongside the new Mercedes CLK set the stage for our
new Panoz GTR 1 entry in sports car racing's premier event," says Dr. Panoz.
