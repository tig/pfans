I was talking with the wonderful and reasonable person who often works
on my car when its demands exceed my abilities; when, he mentioned that
he was rebuilding an engine that was filled with solder (from overly
enthusiastic soldering during the owners fabrication of a secondary oil
cooler).   He mentioned that he was trying to figure out how to clean
the coolers .

I  remember seeing something 3 or 4 months ago about a shop tha cleans
oil coolers for NASCAR racers and was trying to locate the shop or the
source of the info.  I can't remember if it was Pfans , Pono, Excallence
or some other Porsche source.

If anyone can  point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it.

Thanks
