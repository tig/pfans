Dan:

Static toe-in at the front wheels MAY help with your tire-wear 
problem, but it'll probably have negative consequences in terms of 
increased corner-entry understeer.

I assume that you have the bump-steer problem because your car's been
lowered.  I know nothing about the water-cooled Porsches, but
bump-steer can be dialed out of the air-cooled cars by moving the
steering rack... Does anyone make steering-rack spacers for the 951?
