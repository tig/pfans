PCA Club Racers and Drivers Ed. Together at PIR

The distinctive scream of Porsche race cars will return to Portland
International Raceway August 1, 2 and 3. That?s music for the ears for race
fans. This year the race car drivers will share the weekend with drivers
education participants on all three days.

The race cars and drivers education cars will be placed in separate run
groups and will take their turns on the 1.9 mile road course. There will be
two run groups for the racers and two run groups for the drivers ed.
students.

All PCA licensed racers have received a race registration form in the mail.
Race related registration questions should be directed to Kurt Leipzig days
at (503) 293-5386. For other race related questions call Jim Coshow days at
(360) 604-2884 or JCoshow@GSTworld.net.

The drivers education groups are sure to sell out for this event so early
registration is strongly recommended. Drivers can sign-up for one, two or
all three days. Special discounts will be available at the event hotel,
(Shilo Inn, Downtown Vancouver, Washington 360.696.0411).

To receive a drivers education event advance registration form call Dick
Bader days at (503) 239-5230 x-201 or you may email your name and address
or fax number to JCoshow@GSTworld.net.

Thanks,
Jim
