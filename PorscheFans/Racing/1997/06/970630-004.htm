Hello,

I have a quick tow vehicle question.

I have recently starting racing, and at the point where I am
uncomfortable driving my car to the track, racing, and then driving
home. So I am looking to get a tow vehicle.  My car weighs 3000 lpbs,
and I figure an open trailer weighs about 1000. Add some tools /
spares, and I figure I will be towing 5000 lbs.

I also am tired of sleeping in a tent, and I'm too poor to
pay for a motel every night, so I would like to get a camper
to stay in. Normally, I see lots of motor homes at the track,
but I can't justify such a narrow use vehicle. 

So, I'm thinking of getting a pick up truck. I can use the truck to tow
the car on a trailer, and also I can put a slide on camper in the bed
and have somewhere to day. I see slide on campers with bath and shower,
real bed, and kitchen for affordable prices.

I realize that both carrying a camper and towing a trailer requires a
heavy duty truck. I also need space for at least for people, so that
requires an extended cab or crew cab.  My time frame was to get
something next spring. However, I recently saw the following truck:

1985 GMC C30, crew cab, dual rear wheels, 454, long range fuel tanks,
46K original miles. This truck is owned by an former Porsche factory
racer. He made a habit of buying his race cars when the factory was
done with them. For a while now, he has been racing them in vintage
races. He only used the truck to tow his cars to vintage races in a 40'
trailer. So the miles on the truck are for real. The truck was always
stored indoors in the race shop. He recently bought a new truck and has
no use for this one.

I can buy it for 11K. That includes a 12 month 12K mile warrenty on the
powertrain. Everything on the truck works, there are no problems with
it. It has a lot of options, including a 50 gallon fuel cell, diamond
plate running boards, bedliner, towing package, new, special buily
heavy duty trans (they went through two trans before this one was
built), fancy wheels, etc. The interior and exterior look new.

I'm looking for some comments. Specifically, am I crazy for even
considering this truck? Will I go broke buying gas for this beast? I
will have to use it every day to commute to work (10 miles each way).
Is that large a truck overkill for my needs? How come I don't see
people using slide on campers at the track?

Anything else?

I guess that wasn't so quick afterall!
