The bumbling idots in USAC (Unites States Auto Club) lost count of the
laps during the most recent Indy Series race. USAC sanctioned all Indy
Series events and has sanctioned the Indy 500 for a long, long time.

Due to their incomptence, they miscounted laps for several cars. It
seems the automated transponder system USAC used was not exactly
reliable. Luyendyk's team realized this well into the race but USAC told
them to go away.

Anyway, A.J.'s driver was declared the winner by USAC.  In victory lane
Luyendyk shows up and says to the officials (right in front of A.J.) I
won, how come you awarded the race to them? At this point A.J. decided
Luyendyk needed to be physiically punished for his rudeness and the rest
is history (a recount showed Luyendyk indeed did finish first and
several other results were in error .

By the way, Tony George (Supreme Galactic Emporor of Indy racing) had to
personally pull A.J. off of Luyendyk. Shortly thereafter USAC was fired
by the Indy Series for once and for all (this is only about 30 years too
late as they've screwed up the Indy 500 since I was just a child).
