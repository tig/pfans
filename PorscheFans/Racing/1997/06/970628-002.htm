Hi all -

Well today wasn't good for the old transmission ('86 944 NA with 136000
miles).  On my second run at an autocross, I exited a mid-second gear
sweeper into a set of slalom cones.  At the second of five slalom cones, I
found I had no power to the rear wheels.  Tried to put car back into gear
only to hear a lot of grinding noises.  Pulled off line and coasted to the
paddock area. 

There I found lots of tranny fluid pouring out from the cracked cover 
plate to the differential area of the transmission.  This is the side 
that is removalable, the passenger side of the car, and has the 
drive/axle flange connected through it.

Went home to get the trailer and tow the car to the shop where I left it.

Anybody wanna guess or make speculation as to the problem?  Did something
have to break/freeze inside for this damage to occur or could it be that
the side cover plate was just weak.  I would wager that something inside
broke first since the cover is still in place, just cracked quite badly,
and I have no drive to the rear wheels.  I think this is gonna be
expensive but that's racing! 

Any NET wisdom?
