I have an 87 930 with a full cage,  5-point belts
but stock seats.  I am broad-shouldered,  so the
belts don't slip off me and I am not worried about my
safety.  However,  passengers complain and I think 
rightly so.

My question(s):

1.	Does anyone know of a device that attaches
	to these belts at around chest level and
	keeps them on the shoulders of normal
	sized people?

2.	Does anyone know of a shop that inserts holes
	through the headrest of standard 911 seats
	so the belts could go through there,  or a kit
	that I could take to a local shop?

3.	Does anyone know of a reasonably priced race
	seat that still has some adjustment (I could give
	up electric adjustments,  but I still have to get
	in and out as I drive the car daily)?

Thanks.
