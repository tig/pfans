Hello,

Yesterday I drove in my second PCA club race, the event at Pocono. I
drive an E stock 944 turbo S. My race group was made up of class E and
class F. Other cars in class E are 95 993 911's, 84-89 3.2 Euro and
Club Sport Carrera's, and 944 S2 club sport cars. Class F is 944 turbo,
944 S2, 928S, and all 3.2 Carrera, Euro SC, and C2 / C4.

The course used for the race was the 2.5 mile road coarse. It uses
NASCAR turn 1, a chicane at the beginning of the next straight, the
tunnel turn, then a hard left turn into the infield section. The
infield is tight, not much room to pass, then you get dumped back onto
the beginning of the main straight, and get to do it again.

This weekend was the first time I've driven at Pocono. I drove in the
driver ed event on Friday to get more track time. Race practice
Saturday, warm up and qualifying Sunday morning, then race on Sunday
afternoon.

I had a quick warm up Sunday, the car felt good but the session was
very short. Get gridded for qualifying according to times from the warm
up session. Uh oh, my times weren't good, as I was tentative on the
track since the track was wet from rain the night before. It's going to
be an interesting qualifying session.

Get ready for qualifying, I'm gridded behind the #43 944TS of Eric
Ravid. From practice, I know that Eric and I are about the same speed.
I might be a little faster in the banked turns, but Eric is faster in
the road coarse and on the straights.  Qualifying starts, I get out
there and run 1 decent lap, then another. Now I'm behind Eric and I
want to get past so I can go for it. I follow him through the NASCAR 1
(the bowl) and he slows me down a little. Then through the chicane, and
I gain on him going through the tunnel turn (another NASCAR turn, taken
flat out in 4th gear, about 130 or so). I drop down into the turn and
pass Eric. I want to put a little distance between us before I have to
slow to make the hard left (second gear), so I stay on the throttle a
little longer. I try to slow down, and I realize I'm not going to make
the turn. DAMN! I blow the turn (if you screw this turn up, you go
through some cones, and make a left back onto the course) and Eric and
two more cars get by me. I'm mad as hell at myself and get back on the
course with a vengeance. I catch up to the other cars, but can't get
by. Now I'm worried that qualifying time is almost over, and I haven't
had a good lap. I slow down to get some open track, but I slow too
much, and two more cars get by me. I wait a little and then go for it.
I catch the cars in the bowl and ruin my lap. I slow some more, and
just as I have enough open track to get in a clean lap, the checker
flies. Crap! Not a good qualifying run.

I check the charts, and I ran a 1:52.XX. Not good. All weekend I was
running low 1:51's, getting gridded 20-25 for the practice, now it
counts, and I screwed it up and I start 28th (in a 38 car field). I'm
very upset with myself.

Back to my paddock space. Check the car, add some air to the right
side. Relax, drink some fluids. Think about the race.

Onto the grid, depressed about my track position. Eric is like 8 cars
ahead of me, he turned a time of 1:50.4X, which is excellent. I resolve
to drive clean, and to not go off course at the Devil's Elbow (the
tight left at the end of the tunnel turn, I'd been blowing that one all
weekend, I went off there three times). The race that's going on while
we wait on the grid ends.

Grid workers signal 5 minutes to race. In car, put in window net, strap
in, helmet on, gloves on. One minute to race, fire car up.  Get onto
track and in position. Follow the other cars on the warm up lap. Drop
back and accelerate hard. Check boost to make sure I'm getting 1.8 bar,
brake hard to heat up brakes and tires (according to Carrol Smith, you
warm tires more by hard accel and braking, NOT by weaving back and
forth, so that's what I do) and repeat that a few times. Come off of
oval and into road course.  Stay in position. Drive around road course.
In second gear, about 3500 rpm, start coming onto straight, and
everyone takes off.  This time I remember to shift at redline (unlike
in the practice starts) and we go down the straight. The two nice lines
of the warm up lap are gone. Cars are 5 wide down the front straight. I
go to outside to the wall, and the car in front of me, an F class 944
turbo, doesn't. I use my extra HP to motor by. One car passed. Go into
the bowl hard, stay high because cars are still three wide. Drop to
bottom of track and pass a 911 down there.  Come out of bowl and try to
get all the way left for the chicane, but a car is there so I stay one
car width to my right. Go into the chicane side by side and I have a
slight advantage so I move over to the left at the exit and pass the
car. Down the back straight up through the gears, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
shifting right at redline. Scream around the tunnel turn wide open.

Make note to brake EARLY. As I come out of the turn I see the flaggers
going nuts. Waving yellows everywhere in the Devil's Elbow. I see about
3 cars in strange positions, 1 totally off course, 1 backward in the
middle of the track, one 1/2 off, but going again. I go around the car
in the middle of the track on the right side, but the 911 I passed in
the chicane goes around on the left and he passes me. One of the cars
that spun was George Pelligrini in his 951S. He is fast, a lot faster
than me. Now he's behind me, but I don't think he'll stay there. One
lap, and he pulls down on the front straight and passes me going into
the bowl. I drive in hard and turn down. George is at the bottom of the
bowl, so we go through side by side. He has the better line through the
chicane, and that's it, he's past me and there is no way I'm going to
catch him. Later I watch him pass two more cars in the bowl. Very
impressive. We go through the infield OK. Get onto the front straight.
Everything is OK. Catch and pass the 911 the next time we go into the
bowl. I watch my mirrors on the exit of the bowl to make sure he
doesn't try to get inside me at the chicane. I move to the left to
protect my line and turn in for the chicane. I check my mirror and I
watch the 911 overcook the brakes and he slides through the chicane and
keeps on going. That bastard kept on going and got ahead of me when I
went around the chicane. That made me pretty mad but I got by him
again and stayed ahead.

Next car ahead of me is Eric in his red 951. I am not close enough to
catch him but I don't care. I've passed a bunch of cars, I'm happy, and
I don't want to blow my race by doing something stupid. Then we come
through the infield, and before we get onto the main straight there is
a serious incident. A white 911, car #50 has hit the inside of the
wall, and is sliding backwards across the track. I pick my way around
the mess and now I have caught up to Eric. I am not going to try and
pass. I get close to him and start to put the pressure on. He's flying,
and I stay right with him. I gain a lot of ground through the tunnel
turn, and he brakes late for the Devil's Elbow and I stick my nose
under him in the turn. He accelerates out of the turn very quickly, so
I can't get by. At the next turn, a sharp second gear right, I turn in
late and stay on the right. I try to get ahead of Eric, but I can't, so
I fall back in line. We both scream onto the front straight, and zoom
down the track. I shift into 5th gear and watch the track markers fly
by. 3, 2, 1, lift, wait, turn in, try to get the car to the bottom of
the bowl and get back on the power. I'm right behind Eric and pressing
him hard.  Exit the bowl, full throttle towards the chicane. Hard on
the brakes, down to 2nd gear, turn in, make the quick right and then the
quick left. Back up through the gears. Right behind Eric.  Fake like
I'm going to go under him in the tunnel turn, but stay behind. right
behind him, press him through the turn, then get wide at the exit of 1
turn and put two wheels in the dirt. Stay on the power and get back on
the track, no problem and I haven't lost ground. I resolve to try and
pass in the bowl. Again I'm right behind him, up to 6000 rpm in 4th,
quickly into 5th gear, stay on the power. He shuts down at the end of
the straight, I move left and pass. Try to turn left, the car does not
want to, I get under him and hold on. The car starts to slide up
the track, but it sticks and I get back on the power, and I'm ahead.
Stay low in the chicane and stay ahead. Now as long as I don't screw up
I will stay ahead. Careful through the tunnel turn, make the tight left
very careful. Start to pull away. 

There's another car in front of me, Mark Forrester in his F class 911.
I gain a little on Mark. Follow him down the straight and see where he
slows for the bowl. Follow him around the bowl and through the chicane.
Wow, his car lifts the right tire a lot for the right turn in the
chicane and then the left even more for the left turn at the chicane
exit. He can go right over the edge of the track and not even touch
anything. I get a little closer in the tunnel turn, and stay close in
the road course. Back onto the main straight. At the end of the of the
straight, I drop down and pass him in the bowl. Work like a madman to
stay ahead. He's right behind me in the tunnel turn, but I go low and
protect my line. Work around the road course, come onto the straight
and there it is, the checker! I'm done, I'm alive, and I'm happy!

I ended up 14th of 40 cars, and 8th in class of 12. 

In case anyone is interested, here were my lap times from the race:
1:53:62
1:52:29
1:51:06
1:49:64
1:49:28
1:49:65
1:50:06
1:49:14
1:49:39

Considering I qualified at 1:52, I'm very happy. 

Some other tidbits:

We were supposed to have practice starts and a 5 lap fun race on
Saturday. As we were sitting on the grid a large dark cloud approached.
We head out for the lap behind the pace car, and as we are on the
infield section, heading towards NASCAR 3, I see a huge billboard with
'NASCAR' on it blow to pieces. Then I see all the corner workers diving
for cover. We get onto the front straight and go, then a chair blows
across the track. Head into turn 1 and all hell breaks loose,
lightning, thunder, downpour, hail, you name it. Come out of the turn
and the race is black flagged. Drive back to me paddock space and it's
raining like you wouldn't believe, and the rain is going sideways. All
my stuff was soaked. Luckily my crew sprinted back to the paddock and
grabbed as much gear as they could and stuffed it in their cars. So at
least my clothes were dry. My EZ up took a beating.  Of course, the
rain stopped 30 minutes later, but the place was a mess. Power out, the
tent for the dinner blown down, debris everywhere.  That was it for
Saturday.

Some observations of Pocono: The key to the track is the bowl.  For
some reason, probably because I'm stupid, the bowl didn't scare me.  I
didn't have enough guts to try and go through there flat out, but I
don't think too many people did that anyway. I would go down the
straight flat out in fifth gear, at over 5000 rpm, (that has to be
about 140 or so), lift when I got to the '1' sign, then coast a little,
turn in, and get back on the power. It's a little scary when the car
doesn't want to turn, and starts sliding back up the track, but the
tires hook up pretty quickly, and I could go full throttle out of the
turn towards the chicane. I never did get comfortable with the Devils
Elbow. I went off course there three times twice in 1 session. As I
headed into the pits (black flagged you know) Tom Charlesworth said
"You must be having a tough day" and I told him I'd go easier through
there. I screwed it up again during my qualifying.

The flaggers for the event were from Watkins Glenn, Race Communications
of America, RCA, or something like that. They did a great job. Very
professional, easy to see. There was a serious incident where a car hit
the wall in the bowl, hit it hard, and the top got crushed. They got
the guy out and in the ambulance pretty quickly. Later he was
helicoptered out of there. Last I heard, he was going to be OK. That
just serves to remind you of how serious this stuff is.

After the race, Eric came over and congratulated me.  That really meant
a lot to me. We both raced hard, but clean.  He gave me racing room,
and I did the same. There are a lot of good people in club racing.

I got to meet a number of PorscheFan People.  Jerry Wegert
(Jerry944T@aol.com), was there and gave me some good advice. I got to
say hello to Monte Smith, the national steward and real racer.

That's it for me.
