Kent:

The best source in the entire world for this sort of thing is
Aircraft Spruce and Specialty... They've got half a dozen different
weaves of Kevlar and graphite, and they even sell ceramic cloth.

You can reach Aircraft Spruce at 800 824-1930 (Fullerton, CA) or
800 831-2949 (Griffin GA).

However...

"Higher tech" isn't necessarily better.  Carbon fiber and Kevlar are
real light and REAL stiff, but those aren't necessarily the
qualities you need in an oil-cooler airbox... Kevlar, for instance,
is extremely hard to work with, and carbon fiber has really poor
impact resistance.

If I were you, I'd use S-glass... It's easy to work with, nearly as 
light and stiff as Kevlar and carbon fiber, able to withstand higher 
heat than either of them (although this isn't particularly relevant 
to your application), much more impact-resistant than carbon fiber, 
and costs a LOT less.

Aircraft Spruce sells S-glass and all the tape, resin, and other
supplies and tools you'll need.  Get their catalog.
