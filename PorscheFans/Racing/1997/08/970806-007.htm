1.  Porsche sports seats will hold you and the passengers
better, but won't solve the belt problem.

2.  Some progress can be made by simply using a proper-
sized bungie cord wrapped around the top part of the seat
to hold the belts in place.

3.  Better is to see that the belts are attached to each other
with a cross piece of belt webbing just behind the seat back, 
and buy sternum straps,
available from any racing supply, that velcro the belts 
together at about shirt-pocket height.  This will slow
you down in case of fire, but the two steps together,
possibly with some bungie cording just to make it easier
to find the belts when you first get into the seat, will
make a big difference.
