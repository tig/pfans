Joshua Halder writes that he doesn't like the vacuum system (I don't
either - messy, uncertain if bubbles from system or just from around
bleeder), prefers the buddy system (convenient at track with lots of
buddies around and just a quick bleed needed, no set up or special
equipment needed), but has had bad as well as good experiences with
the air pressure bleeding system.

I'm all ears about the bad, Joshua.  I like this particularly for changing the
fluid in the whole system, or alone in garage.  Can't say as I've ever
noticed the obvious possible problems (water in the air gets into fluid, or
just the air used gets in) you'd think this method might have, but I'm
sometimes oblivious to problems, deny they have happened, etc.

For those who want to construct an air pressure bleeder system, see
Up-Fixin Volume V, page 46.  Even gives part numbers,  though any
method of closing the vent line will work, and you don't absolutely have
to have the 914 screw-on fittings - anything which screws onto a valve
stem and pokes the Schrader valve open so air can get into an attached
hose will do.  The author suggests using a tire with 37 psi in it as the
source of air pressure.  While using a tire is the genius of this system, I
think using less air pressure (the 25-30 which might normally reside in
the front tire nearest the reservoir is what I use, and if the tire were to
be low, it would work anyway.  No need to position the brake pedal.

ps: Maybe someone comfortable with degrees Kelvin would calculate
and share results of what the pressure increase in a tire is from 80F to
200F, first with dry air (treating it as a mix of nitrogen and oxygen for
simplicity, and ignoring fact that volume of tire probably increases at least
a tad with pressure increase?), then with nitrogen with its
compressability factor difference out in the third decimal place, then with
"wet" air.  I'm of the "it's the water" school as to why anyone would not
just use air, although my home compressor won't go above about 90 psi,
so it leaves the air tanks quite a bit short.  Since I use pressure bleeders
in the rims to keep pressures more or less constant in the tires, I use a lot
of air topping tires up after they have been heated and cooled, and
pumping up race slicks which went way down overnight, and letting my
fellows in need use my air, so I like all the air I can get at the track (no
room for a compressor to take along, I've got the kitchen sink as it is). 
Only folks I know who use nitrogen in tires get it from the 2000 or
whatever huge air bottle they have to run their air tools from trackside,
but the list broadens one's horizons wonderfully.
