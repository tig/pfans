With great concern, Riesentoter is sad to report that long-term Porsche Club
member Mike Keller of West Chester, PA was seriously injured in the single
car, heavy crash of his aubergine colored '72 911 into the wall in NASCAR
Turn #1 while qualifying for Riesentoter's Pocono Club Race on Sunday, August
17, 1997.  Mike lay in critical but stable condition in a deep coma in the
Central Nervous System Unit at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, PA.
 Although he did suffer a closed head injury, Mike has no broken bones, no
bleeding, and apparently no spinal cord injury.

Mike's wife, Ilene, and his parents Norma and Bill Keller are by his side
'round the clock.  His attending physicians are some of the best in the
medical care field, experienced with racer's injuries.  The family has asked
that well wishers send cards only--no flowers please--in care of Mr. & Mrs.
William Keller, 21 Station Road, Cranbury, NJ  08512.  Bill's home phone
number is (609) 655-3163, and he asks that calls be kept to a minimum.

Riesentoter will update this information as we learn of any change in Mike' s
condition.  Our prayers and deepest hopes for his speedy recovery are with
Mike and his family.   

John Heckman, President
