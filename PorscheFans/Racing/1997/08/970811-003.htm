This car would be in a GT class under PCA rules, GT4 I believe.  The only 
gating factor for the GT classes is displacement and I believe GT4 captures 
all NA cars from 2.0 to 2.8.  There are no suspension limitiations or tire 
size limitations or weight restrictions so you can imagine what you may run 
against.  My guess is that you'd have a hard time being competitive.  Howeve=
r, 
if you like the car and the price is right and it's fresh and sound, GT4 is =
a 
very popular and competitive class and you'll have plenty of cars to dice 
with.  For reference, my experience has been that you can find a competitive=
 
GT4 car with a pumped 2.7 or 2.8, great suspension, and well prepped for 
around 25-28K..........

    I am considering purchasing my first race car and need some advice from
    your collective wisdom.  I have raced SCCA and done numerous schools,
    track days etc.

    The car is a 1969 911 RS Replica.
    It has a 2.4 litre engine w/ 10.5 to 1 compression (supposedly making
    220 HP or so) with 915 transmission from a 1973 911.
    Webb cams with a 904 grind.
    It has 911 S brakes in front, stock brakes in back).
    It weighs 1900 lbs
    It has a crankfire MSD
    The engine and trans Protech (has anyone ever heard of them)
    It has a fuel cell.

    it does not have a limited slip diff.

    My questions are....

    Having never run PCA races, does this car seem like it could be
    competative in its class?
    I will have it checked out by a shop for the usual stuff.
    Assuming it gets a clean bill of healrh, what should I offer the guy
    for the car?
    Is the 2.4 litre, a good motor?  Does it have a good or bad reputation?
    Are there any other goodies that one needs to be competative in this
    class?

    Please fill my inbox with input....

    thanks
