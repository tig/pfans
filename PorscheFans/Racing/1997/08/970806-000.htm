Ok, this may be preaching to the choir for most folks, but I'll say it
just for grins anyway.

The almost unanimously agreed upon first investment for a driver, is the
driver. Seat time, Seat time, and more Seat time. Ok, so you're doing
drivers ed events, excelent start. Do more of 'em! :) This really is the
best way to improve. Go to autoxes as well. Anything that gives you seat
time and an opportunity to explore the car and yourself at the limit is
a good thing. Whether it's at 35 or 135 miles an hour.

Step two? Shocks! I personally would never recomend anyone running race
rubber on stock or tired shocks. This will make a huge diference in the
handling of the car. And is, in my opinion, the first investment one
should make in a car that will be driven hard.

If you're doing alot of track events, then you probably will want an
extra set of wheels and tires. Or at the very least, be prepared to
replace your street tires a little more often. I'd say start with
something like the Yokohama A509. It's a great tire, inexpensive, and
will allow you to learn how the car behaves at, and beyond, the limit of
adhesion at a more controllable level. Then, after you've gained some
experience with sliding around on street tires, get some race tires. I
highly recomend learning on street tires. You will not only learn how to
keep the street tires happy (not overdriving the corners, locking up the
brakes and all of that), but that experience will save you alot of money
in race tires. Alot of folks who jump right in and get race tires, burn
'em up in a big hurry. Street tires are alot more forgiving about
mistakes than expensive soft race tires.

If you're doing alot of track events, then a good set of brake pads are
also in order. I won't make a brand name recomendation here for fear of
starting a "my pad's better than your pad" thread, but investigate all
of your purchase choices thoroughly. Talk to shops that do P-car race
prep work and ask for their advice. But don't go on just one shop's
suggestion. And yes, I have a preference...

****Brake ducting, definately. Absolutely. Without question! And bleed
your brakes often if you're doing alot of track events.**** 
Getting it up to 100+mph won't do you any good if you can't bring it
down before the hairpin. BTDT. =8-O

If you intend on doing any competetive events, then get a rule book and
read it before you do any further mods. Then, if you've still got money
burning a hole in your wallet, send it to me! :) 

No really, I'd say go for further suspension improvements, a cage or a
harness. Power is great, but a car that handles better, and is driven
better will always win. Ok, to an extent. But the point is, suspension
improvents will give you far more benefit for the money than power.
Power costs money, lots of it, how fast can you afford to go? 

If your exhaust is shot, then replace it. If you just want that extra
grunt for launching away from the stoplight, or smoking that vette next
you in the fast lane, the do it. But if you're just starting out in
track events, and want to invest your money wisely, don't put it into
your engine untill you're _really_ ready for it. There are much better
places in your car to hide your money.

Hope you find this usefull.
