Joe,

Unfortunaly that motor combination puts you in between a rock and a hard
place.  I was just recently in the same situation, and I just finished
rebuilding my motor as a euro 2.7.

For PCA racing, the GT4 class is anything above 2.2 and up to, but not
including 2.8.  I.E. the largest class legal motor is 2.79.  I don't
pretend to be an expert, but from what I seem to recall, most Porsche
motors are slightly under what they are listed as.  For example, (NOT
EXACT NUMBERS) a 2.7 may actually only be 2695cc.  I belive the the
combination used by Porsche to build the 2.8 as raced in the 73 RSR is
over 2800cc.  Therefore you can not run the 2.8 in GT4.  To the best of my
knowledge, you can not build a motor larger then 2.7 without having custom
pistons and cylinders made.

This sounds like a great car, and if you can negotiate a fair price, you
should buy it.  I plan to run my car, when it's finished, in GT4S (Street
tires), as opposed to GT4R (racing slicks).  Not always the case, but if
someone is going to spend big bucks building a motor, they are probably
going to run slicks.

I have a good friend that runs in GT4R and I have seen the competition. 
It's pretty fierce.  You can always build another motor, but a well built,
and light, car to start with is essential.  Just make sure thay have not
forgone safety for the sake of a few pounds.  If you might be interested
in a killer GT4 motor, let me know.  My friend built the winning GT4R
motors for both the Sebring and Road Atlanta races.  And in December we
hope to complete the sweep of the southeast races in Savannah.

Good Luck
