Yes GT4 is VERY competitive. 

You don't mention the type of injection, brakes or suspension set up which
are VERY important. While power is certainly quite important we kick a lot of
high powered buttocks on the track with our better handling cars. Seat time
and suspension will buy you a lot more podium finishes than Bhp ever will.
Besides it is a lot more fun to pass in the corners than on the straights -
any Cobra, Vette or Mustang or 951 ;-) can do that!

"S" brakes with high quality race pads and drilled rotors are fine for this
light of a car. If this is truly an RS replica it should have these. An
adjustable bias valve is highly recommended as well and is easy and
inexpensive to add.

High quality adjustable sway bars, large torsion bars or coil-overs, Bilstein
decambered front struts (2.25 degree negative), Bilstein rear shocks (2
degree negative), spherical ball MacPherson strut tower bushings with cross
bar, high quality suspension bushings throughout, perfect alignment and
balance etc., etc. will be absolutely necessary to handle properly and hang
the big G's with the fast boys. Note: your car is very light (we are used to
2200 - 2500 lbs) so the suspension settings are not etched in stone! We also
highly recommend Bilsteins with the Bilstein Racing revalving for special
rebound and compression valving. Konis are OK but certainly not the best.

I am sure there will be disagreement but the old traditional 225/245 combo
just isn't enough rubber for this level of racing - competitively speaking.
Properly done you can fit 8x16" or 17" fronts with Hoosier 245/45's and 9x17"
rears with Hoosier 275/40/17 for what we have found to be the best possible
DOT grip on a Carrera flared car. Anything over 210 Bhp has the power to
rotate these just fine and with a 7:31 R&P you should be pleased with the
gearing overall.  A less expensive option (but not as good) would be 9x16
rears with 255's. We can't get the rear 16" 275's to fit and the 255's (look
like airplane tires) are hard without lots of flare work. 

Sorry for the length reply but hope this info proves helpful.

p.s. If the car was mechanically and cosmetically perfect I probably still
wouldn't pay more than $19k for it. We've got lots of really fast race cars
for sale in the $22 - $30 range on the West Coast.
