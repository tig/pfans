         Dear Mr. Clardy:
         
         	Thank you for your letter via the Internet expressing 
         support for my Senate Bill 42 which would exempt from the 
         biennial smog check requirement all vehicles 25 or more model 
         years old.  I believe that the relatively modest number of 
         vehicles older than 25 years and the operating characteristics 
         of such vehicles provide a firm basis for the smog check 
         exemption proposed in my legislation.  As I have stated on 
         numerous occasions, I will endeavor to ensure a fair, effective 
         and convenient smog check program.
         
         	SB 42 was approved by my committee (the Senate 
         Transportation Committee) on January 21st, 6-0, and by the 
         Senate Appropriations Committee on March 17th, 7-1.  I presented 
         SB 42 to the full Senate on March 20th, and I am pleased it 
         passed unanimously, 33-0.  It was approved by  the Assembly 
         Committee on Transportation on June 16th by a vote of 17 - 0.  
         The Assembly Appropriations Committee, however, rejected SB 42, 
         8-8.  Subsequently, the committee voted to place SB 42 on its 
         Suspense File.  Generally, any measure whose fiscal impact 
         exceeds $150,000 will be transferred to the Committee's so-
         called "Suspense File," which means postponement of action on 
         the merits of a bill pending adoption of the 1997-98 Budget.  In 
         anticipation of Budget adoption, Assembly Appropriations has 
         scheduled the Suspense File hearing for August 29th.  Continuing 
         effort and vigilance still are required because the California 
         Air Resources Board, the California Department of Consumer 
         Affairs and the Western States Petroleum Association vigorously 
         seek to defeat the measure.  I recommend further letters to 
         members of the Assembly Appropriations Committee, a roster of 
         whom I enclose herewith,  urging them to approve SB 42 and 
         transmit it to the Assembly Floor on August 29th.  Perhaps you 
         could notify your friends and family who also are interested in 
         passage of this important legislation.
         
         	Once again, thanks for your interest and support.  If 
         you require additional assistance or information, just notify me 
         accordingly.
         
         					Sincerely yours,
