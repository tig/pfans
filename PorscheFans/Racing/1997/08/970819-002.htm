<<I'm installing a 5pt harness in my '87 951 with factory sport seats. 
Can
anyone help me out regarding placement of the anti-sub strap?  At what
point
on the floor should it mount?  In front of, of behind the front edge of
the
seat?  Should it be snug when fastened?>>

Hi Jeff,

I wouldn't recommend using a single sub strap with a seat that does not
have a cutout for it. To do what it's is intended to do, the sub belt
should attach at or behind the location of the belt locking mechanism.
The purpose of the sub belt is to stop you from submarining forward so
the lap belt stays on your hips instead of riding up and compressing
your stomach. If you mount it in front of the seat, the seat cushion
will compress and you will submarine some giving the lap belt the
opportunity to rise off your hips causing internal injuries.

I'd recommmend swapping the single strap for a double strap. If your
sanctioning organization permits it, you can use the same mounting
points you use for your lap belt to attach the straps of the sub belt.
