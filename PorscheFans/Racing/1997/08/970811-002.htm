    I am considering purchasing my first race car and need some advice from
    your collective wisdom.  I have raced SCCA and done numerous schools,
    track days etc.

    The car is a 1969 911 RS Replica.
    It has a 2.4 litre engine w/ 10.5 to 1 compression (supposedly making
    220 HP or so) with 915 transmission from a 1973 911.
    Webb cams with a 904 grind.
    It has 911 S brakes in front, stock brakes in back).
    It weighs 1900 lbs
    It has a crankfire MSD
    The engine and trans Protech (has anyone ever heard of them)
    It has a fuel cell.

    it does not have a limited slip diff.

    My questions are....

    Having never run PCA races, does this car seem like it could be
    competative in its class?
    I will have it checked out by a shop for the usual stuff.
    Assuming it gets a clean bill of healrh, what should I offer the guy
    for the car?
    Is the 2.4 litre, a good motor?  Does it have a good or bad reputation?
    Are there any other goodies that one needs to be competative in this
    class?

    Please fill my inbox with input....

    thanks
