Dear Matthew,
I, too am built like the proverbial masonry convenience to which you
compare yourself, and I can tell you that I recently visited OG racing in 
Manassas, VA,
and  sat in a Sparco "America" seat, which is a wider version of one of their 
other
seats, and found it very accomodating. I believe they go for around $450.

Apparently the seat is so named, because Sparco, an Italian company, believe
that Americans have larger rear-ends than members of their home market. All I
can say is, it's a good thing Pavorotti doesn't drive for Ferrari.

Cheers,
Nick Craft

I would like some input re: seats. I am in the market for a race seat
and there are obviously many choices and preferences. My biggest concern
is being able to fit in the seat. I have a long and wide body, broad
shoulders and short legs (some say a brick s...house look) and  I have
sat in several seats and most have been too tight in the butt and
shoulders. If anyone has similar body proportions and has found a
comfortable seat, I'd appreciate hearing make, model, etc.
