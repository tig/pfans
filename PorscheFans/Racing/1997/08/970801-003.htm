Hey guys,
I have been teaching at SP for 10 years and I can tell you that in a 911, 
you should only have to brake at 1, 5, and  a bit at 10. It is the same in 
a 914 only the 10 is less braking due to speed coming out of 9.  I do 
1:37's in a 90hp 2200# car with brakes the size of paper clip box you 
should be able to do much better than that.

Your brakes are HUGE and the rotors are vented so they cool down a lot 
faster than most but they can use all the air they can get, that's why I 
recommend the cool kit.

All in all we all come down at the end of the straight and the bottom of 
the hill, buts that all you need to do and it can be done late given the 
nice power vector the 911 will give you.

Hi John:

I use the Eezibleed pressure bleeder available from eezibleed@aol.com
for ~$35.   It works great for me.  I put the car on 4 jackstands,
attach the empty
bleeder to the brake  reservoir with a tire supplying air at 10-15psi.
Plug the
overflow hose and crack all the nipples to get most of the old fluid out of 
the
reservoir w/o getting air in.  Then, I add new fluid to the reservoir,
fill up the
bleeder container and go around again until I get new fluid at each corner.
Takes 20-30mins.  I did need to use masking tape on the Eezibleed bottle
to seal off air leaks but it worked fine after doing that once.

I live in Easton, PA so I may be too far but I'd be happy to loan it to you 
if
you're going to the Glen and need it done ASAP.   BTW, do use ATE Super
Blue Racing fluid or Motul Racing because they have much higher boiling
points than street DOT-4 fluid and therefore less liklihood of boiling.

I was there at Summit Pt. when you lost your brakes.
I have the bright blue '74 911 Targa which was parked across from you.

Yeah, but Dan fails to note he's driving a 914-2.0.  I think we have to
brake in
a lot more turns in a 911.

'74 911/3.0 - painting my duck-tail/Ruf spoiler/wheels tomorrow.
