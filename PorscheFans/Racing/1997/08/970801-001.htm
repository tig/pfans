"Brakes, we don't need no stinking brakes"

Both Garrots and Snap-On sell an air driven bleeder. Mini-vac sells a great 
tool that will suck through the fluid.

What you are trying to do is get not only the air out of the lines, but 
getting the wet (water in fluid) fluid out of the system. You can flush the 
old fluid out by just opening the bleeder and let it drain into some catch 
can. This is called a gravity bleed you just add more in the resivior and 
let it flush through. Then you play the pump trick to get any air that 
hangs around.

The reason your brakes went away is not air in the line it's water turning 
to steam. You most likely thought you had changed the fluid in the last 90 
days and you were mistaken. That's why it is on the tech form, to make sure 
the fluid is fresh and not wet. Flush it out, use ATE Blue, and only use 
the brakes at turns 1, 5, and maybe just a bit at 10. If you have a hard 
time with that get a cool - brake kit.

Subject:	bleeding brakes

any hints on bleeding my brakes with compressed air? ive always done it
the old fashioned way, get a buddy who can pump.  using air looks to be
a ton easier.  i dont know where to pressurize the master
cylinder(911SC).  do i need to make a fitting?  i assume i wont need
much pressure to get the job done, 10 lbs max?  when bleeding do i need
the pedal in or out?  otherwise im in good shape.

thanks
John Mcgary
'78 911sc that lost brakes in turn 10 at summit point
