in my humble opinion, tires.  then brakes.  anyone can go fast in a straight,
but the higher average will prevail.  slowest point on the track?  turns!
 the more speed you can carry, the higher the average.  all r-compund tires
are fine.  the hoosiers are best but will only last one track event.  next
are the R-1's, but again tire life is something to think about.  yoko have a
great new long life track tire in the A032's.  one tire that is popular for
its consistency is Kumho which is the one i use.  it may differ by only half
of a second, but they will last atleast two more track events than the R-1's.
 we do this for pleasure, not money.

next are brakes,  try hawk blues.  the later you can slow down for a turn,
the faster the lap times.  ie.  mustangs are faster than preludes, but the
prelude can stop 100 feet later than a mustang. result:  same times on big
tracks, FASTER on smaller ones! (i have access to the results of both cars)

remember the bmw thread that is going around (i do own a few bimmers).  bmw's
traditionally have too little horsepower (E-30 ///M3 = 189 HP), but htey make
up for it in braking and turning!

becareful when you modify your suspension.  tlak to people that have done it
and do not listen to marketing hype.  i modified my suspension recently and
wound up putting stock parts baack in there because they were better.

horsepower is the last thing i would do because it has the smallest effect on
track performance for the dollar.

you can never over look a good instructor (and don't forget to be a good
student!).  come to think about it, this is the most important improvement.
 remember how well price cobb and hurley haywood did at one lap a few years
ago in stock cars.

i hope i have shed some light on this for you
