stores carry carbon fiber/fiberglass weaves in widths up to 54"...West 
Marine, Challenger, E&B, M&E, etc.  Prices last winter were around 
$10-12/yd (36x54) for a "medium-exotic" styles; ie., half carbon, half 
E-Glass.  I am not aware of any stock pre-laminated carbon-fiber; it is 
always custom made by the builders. (Have been in the marine industry for 
25 years.)

Flat sheets are relatively easy to make at home.  If you are not 
confident in epoxy lamination processes, I'd be happy to build what you 
are after.  Please private E-Mail specs and I'll give you a quote.  I 
also build carbon/epoxy wing sections to spec, if you're interested.
