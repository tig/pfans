Scott,
	There is an old quote that works here, "The way to go faster is to go 
faster".

	What that means is that before you start trying to get more bang out of 
the car, get all the bang that is in the car already. Most drivers without 
say 30-60 track days don't drive the car at 10/10's. My recommendation is 
if you have less than 30 track days is to buy more track days. Get the seat 
time in, then when you run out of car start with the suspension and brakes.

After you have used up all of that money, you just might look at more power

Say a guy is on a limited budget, but wants to improve performance at
driver's education events.  He's got a '78 Euro Targa that is stock except
for the addition of the right front wheel well oil cooler (trombone
replacement).  What should he do first and approximately how much will it
cost.  What about second, etc?  Where should the money go?  Main
consideration is bang-for-the-buck.
Track wheels and tires?; if so, which?
Suspension modifications?; if so, which?
Exhaust modifications?; 20 hp w/pre-'74?
"Cool brake" scoops?

Opinions and recommendations are greatly appreciated.
