    Sure, Jeff.

    Uh-oh... It sounds as though you're thinking of routing the belt
    up from the floor and around the front of the seat.  DON'T do it
    that way; it's ineffective and dangerous.

    The sub-strap's primary purpose is to hold the lap belts down
    around your hips, preventing them from riding up over your waist
    and crushing your internal organs in the event of a crash.  If
    the strap is routed FORWARD from the harness buckle, it won't be
    able to do that.  Additionally, it'll tend to pull the lower
    edge of the buckle forward, thereby forcing the upper edge into
    your abdomen... Very uncomfortable.

    What you really want is for the sub strap to exert a DOWNWARD
    force on the buckle.  The best way to accomplish that is to cut
    a hole in your seat just in front of your crotch (or buy a real
    race seat that already has the hole) and run the sub strap
    straight down through that hole to an eyebolt with a big backup
    plate behind it.

    Second best, if you don't want to cut up your seat, is to mount
    the sub strap to the lap-belt mounting points, thread it through
    the gap between the seat bottom and seat back, sit on it, and
    pull it up between your thighs.

    Note that I said "lap-belt mounting POINTS", not "point"; that's
    because you want a DOUBLE sub-strap, not a single one.  Double
    sub-straps are not only stronger than singles, they're also much
    more testicle-friendly.

> Should it be snug when fastened?

    It should pull downward hard enough to prevent the lap belts
    from moving up above your hips no matter how hard you pull on
    them.
