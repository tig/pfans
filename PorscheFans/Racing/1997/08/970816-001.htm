You don't say how wide you are, what your budget is or how radically light
weight you want to go (often tied to budget though).

I am not particularly wide but can't fit into the 19 -20 inchers either. I
have Koenig's RSL??? seat and fit nicely. Its better for broad backs and
gives all the support a racing seat should. They are steel framed - very
strong and have an adjustable back angle (boy I sure like that feature) but
are not particularly light. I've seen too many glass and carbon fiber seats
break up in accidents for me to go that route. Besides I race in a production
class and have minimum weight limits anyway. If this sounds like what you
want let me know and I'll look up the complete part # which I just can't
remember these daze.
