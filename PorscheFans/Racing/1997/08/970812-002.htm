Joe Seminetta asks if a 2.4 is competitive in GT4.  GT 4 covers anything
larger than 2.2 up to 2.8.  The 2.8, however, is not the 2.8 guys run in
SCCA GT-2.  The 70.4 X 92 mm engine is a tad larger than 2.800 liters, so
you can't run it in GT-4.  You could run 91mm cylinders, or somehow
stroke a crank to alter the equation, but most folks run 2.7s because of
the prohibitive cost of special pistons and cylinders (if you could even
find them) or a one off crank.  For a race engine, there is much to be said
for using parts you can find replacements for when they break, because
they will.

Fellow around here has an 1800 lb 914 with a 2.4.  He is close to
competitive, but isn't running up front.  I could keep ahead of him and up
in the hunt with my 2.7.  He will be a bear he gets his 2.7 in.  My 2.7
broke this year so I ran a 2.3.  Had a great dice at Stapleton all race long
with some cars from a couple of other classes.  Would have been a drag
without them, though.

Walt Fricke (2.3 had a an Elgin 310 camshaft break last weekend -
anyone else have a 911 camshaft shear just before the #5 exhaust?)
