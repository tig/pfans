Jeff - My experience has been somewhat similar, though the wear hasn't
been quite so fast. My left front has been the one to wear, even
though most of the courses I've run are counter-clockwise (I haven't
rotated l-r). Alignment has been checked, and is stock. My current
theory is that tire pressures were too high; I was using 36 psi, in
accordance with a quote from BFG to use one psi per 100 pounds of
auto weight, plus two psi at the end of the car where the engine is.
Last Monday at NHIS I used 31 psi; too soon to tell much, but no
uneven wear was visible at the end of the day. The "groove of doom"
is toward the outside of the tire, and is blamed on too-low pressure,
so there is a tiny bit of rationale there. Plus I couldn't think
of anything else, except maybe my driving.
