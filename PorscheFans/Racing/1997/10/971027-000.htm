Well, I will admit I wasn't there on Thursday when this happened but I
heard about the accident from a couple of different sources which I deem
reliable.  And there was a car that was wrapped up with covers in the back
of the pits with body parts leaning against the back of the canvas 
awning.  Maybe this wasn't a Rohr car?  I don't know, I just reported 
what I saw and was told.  The pieces sure seemed to fit the situation.

David, were you in attendance at Laguna?

Maybe someone else in attendance can come forward with further information.
