You never mentioned what club was running this event. Safety issues, if
you are concerned, should ALWAYS be brought up to the event chair or
safety steward then and there. Don't wait, if you're worried, then there
may be a way to mitigate some of the dangers.

Yup, immoveable object vs. light weight tin foil moving at high speed.
The outcome should NEVER be in doubt. You _will_ loose. I'm very glad
that the driver was unhurt.

This should have never happened. My guess (not having been there) was
that there was a rush to get the course cleared, and without thinking
someone turned the key before -*disconnecting the battery*-. If a car
has just had a major shunt and gotten smushed, especially anywhere near
the engine or fuel tank, then never ever turn the key untill you're
positive that there are no fuel leaks. That's why most prepared
competition cars have big, red, easy to see, and esay to reach cuttoff
switches to disconnect the battery in a hurry if the car gets smushed.

Also, (and again I'm assuming 'cause I wasn't there) that in the attempt
to promptly controll the fire the engine lid was popped open to get
better access to the fire. This is a great plan if you've got a giant
fire suppression system like a fire truck. But with a small 20lb fire
bottle, or even a couple of 'em, you're simply giving the fire better
access to -air-. And that usually will burn a car to the ground in no
time. Leave the engine lid closed untill you have the big guns to fight
the fire with. It won't prevent the fire from spreading, but it will
slow it down, and give more time for the truck to arrive.
 
I'm saying this as a Safety Steward, and as a competitor. This is
something that can happen when we play with our cars in such a manner.
And I think it's up to each and every one of us to make sure we can do
it as safely as possible. And if we do then, god forbid, there should be
a nasty accident, we can walk away, shrug our shoulders, say "@#$%! Oh
well, that's racing", and have our racing buddies buy us a few pints of
beer later on to wash the soot off with.


By the way Michael, congratulations on whoopin' the competition as a
rookie! You know, they're gonna be afwully peeved when you don't show up
again. It's like winning a huge pot in poker and cashing out on the next
hand. In the old west, that was a shootin' offense. :)
