Craig:

I think there may have been a "bolt in" rule several years ago.  At this
point, welded in is just fine.  The nicest cages I've seen for the 944 are
from Racetech.  These are technically bolted in, but the mounting plates
are welded, resulting in a cage that is as stiff as a "fully welded" one.

I agree with you about racing with a roll bar only vs. a full cage.  Don't
know why anyone who wants to be competitive would not install a cage (even
if not worried about their own safety).  It's *free* chassis stiffening!
