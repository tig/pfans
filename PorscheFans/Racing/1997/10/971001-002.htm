<<  1. Should I do torsion bars first?  Anderson recommends 22mm front and
28mm rear before going with sway bars.  If so, can anyone recommend where to
pick some up for a reasonable cost--even used?  I'm definitely on budget
here.>>

R:  For dual purpose street and track the 22 x 28 setup works very well.
 However, because it is so popular they are harder to find used unless you
catch the guy who is upgrading to a full race setup. Keep your eyes focused
on all the various Porsche classifieds you can find and keep your phone
dialing finger poised for action. Do front and rear sway bars first.

<<  2. If the front sway bar is installed, do I necessarily need to install a
rear sway bar?  In other words, is it a bad idea to install only a front sway
bar?>>

R:  We have absolutely proven that the rear sway bar is the most important
and frequently neglected suspension component (of course they are ALL
important but I am talking about single MOST important).  The 911 is rear
weight biased so that's where you want to focus your control. The slightest
adjustment of a rear bar will have a lot more affect than corresponding
adjustment to the front. Bottomline - you should have both front and rear.
 Also the rear is easier to install and cheaper than front so your costs
aren't doubled with both. 

<<  3. If I do install only the front sway bar and do not do the torsion
bars,  what should be the setting on the adjustable sway bar?   

R:  Install sway bars first then torsion bars - if you can't afford to do
both at once. The sway bars are the best investment because they allow me to
fine tune the car's balance (turn-in and swing) to best match the track and
conditions. Each track will demand a different setup for optimum performance
- you don't leave your sway bar settings the same for Laguna Seca as you do
for Willow Springs or when the slalom chairman drives a 914 and sets up the
track for his likes vs. the 911 driving chairman's version of the ideal track
setup (heaven forbid if a 928 guy sets up the course, hehehehe). While spring
rate is important, torsion bars aren't adjustable so you get what you get
despite changing track conditions. 

Adjust the bar according to the track conditions and your individual handling
needs.
If you install only a Weltmeister 22mm front bar, your stock rear bar will be
undersized. So I suspect you will need very little front bar to do the job if
you need to get the rear end to swing around on a tight course. If you are a
beginner who prefers the comfort of understeer then while you will be quite
slow (and slaughtered by your veteran competition who are comfortable, and
setup, to dive and throw their cars around) you will at least be comfortable
with your car.

Ross
