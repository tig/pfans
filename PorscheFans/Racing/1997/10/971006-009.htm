Marc:  Please relpy to doab@msn.com with your email address.  It only came 
through saying your name, and therefore I cannot reply, except through 
Porschefans.com which not everyone prefers to read specific interests.

Car is Kelly green and in NJ.

Thanks for the inquiry, and reply if still interested.

Regards, Mike
