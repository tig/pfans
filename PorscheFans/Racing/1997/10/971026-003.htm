Lots of folks had something to say about my post on cages and the future of
PCA racing.  Several seemed to think the cost of the cage was the only
issue.  I have been told that I shouldn't be racing if I can't afford it et.
by some well meaning folks.   I am sorry my arguments were not clear enough
to be taken for what they were.   These are only my opinions about what I
see as a change from a run what you brung philosophy to a more serious pure
race philosophy.

As to cost of a car.  I race a 3.2 Carrera.  I have spent well over $10K in
track preparation with me doing the work (which I enjoy)  plus the cost of
the car and consumables.  The stuff installed in the car is all good
equipment from the Glen Sander hollow torsion bars to B & B exhaust and
performance friction 90 brake pads.  This winter it will get a new front air
dam and oil cooler and who knows maybe even a cage.  A well  prepared track
only car in this class will run $35K to $45K to set up.   I have a great
roll bar made by Dougherty.  If you have priced one lately,  you know this
bar actually cost more than some cages at about $750 shipped not installed.
It is the same bar ( except mine actually fits well ) found in a certain C
class winner that has won best prepared at least once that I know of and is
found in a nationally recognized race prep shop's advertising ( not
Dougherty ).  This set up allows me to have 1 sports car that I drive a
bunch and compete with on a limited basis.   My wives BMW doesn't count.
The cost issue in my arguments is not $2K for a cage but the $35 to $45K for
a separate car.  I am considering buying a 944 or 914 race car for what I
have spent in prep on my 911.  And yes I do race on a budget.  Don't you?

I know of several very expensive and very fast cars that have roll bars.  I
know that not all of the folks who have written saying  "not having the best
safety equipment money can buy is STUPID" do not have things like central
fire systems and NASCAR style cages.

I have heard from several folks that agreed with my thoughts.

Thanks for your time.

Bryan
