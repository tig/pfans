I am just a novice drivers school student but allow me to take a shot at
this answer.  Note that you have a fraction of a second to correct for
your original mistake.  The adjustment has to be a reaction not an
actual thought process.

Every school I have attended and all the books I read taught me that
slow is fast.  My translation of this is actually "smooth is fast"  I
assume that when you saw the apex you "hammered" the right pedal.  I
think this is where your troubles began.  When you hammered the gas you
immediately loaded the rear drive shafts which created the wheel spin.
It takes a split second later for the weight to be transferred to the
rear end of the car.   (transfer time is directly related to chassis
set-up stiffer = faster)  This is similar to what happens when breaking
in a straight line.  If you immediately hammer the breaks the front
tires will not grab because the transition from full throttle to full
breaking was made to quickly and the weight has not yet transferred to
the front end.  (If I recall Bruce Anderson's book correctly he said to
stab the breaks to transfer the weight and then squeeze.)

Again, all this takes place faster than most of us (read I) can react.
I think your only hope was to lift slightly until the wheels regained
traction and then squeeze the throttle.  Again, all this takes place
very quickly.  The only part I am not sure about is the wheel spin.  I
had the same situation in turn 11?? (last turn b-4 the pit straight). at
Watkins Glen.  I apexed early and had to lift slightly, the lift brought
the nose out slightly, and then I squeezed the gas to straighten myself
out.  I had the help of a nice curb to run up on but no room for error.
There is NO run off area in that turn.

I hope this is good food for thought...
