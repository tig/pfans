However, it's also added weight. Not that I'd _ever_ go wheel-to-wheel
without a cage. I have done trials without a cage, and felt only a
little nervous trusting my built-in roll bar. But where I've been
running it is very difficult to go into the weeds, much less encounter
anything that could get a well prepped 914 on its roof. I'm not saying
it can't happen, but it was unlikely. BTW, I am getting GCR legal roll
protection installed by the spring.
