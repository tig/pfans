Responding to Craig Seko:

Craig, your friend's advice is inconsistent with what I understand the
rule to be, and I've had several conversations with Harry Hall about
cages.

I just got a custom cage built in my car, welded in, and wanted to make
sure it would be legal.   Basically, in the stock classes, welded cages
are fine, so long as they meet the tubing size requirements, and do not
extend beyond the passenger's compartment.  Most cages in the stock
classes are bolt in, but that's just for cost and the fact that most of
us aren't sure when we start racing if it will be what we want to do.

I had a bolt in cage that I ran for several seasons before I concluded
the driver's door protection wasn't as strong as I wanted.  I've never
been upside down in a car, but I have an active imagination, and don't
think I'd like to.  I also didn't see much side impact protection from 
the bolt-in cage that I had.  So, I wanted to build the NASCAR style 
driver's impact out to just under the skin of the door, and I thought 
that would be legal.

The rule says that interior panels must remain intact except where they
interfere with a cage, or that's the gist of it.  My interpretation was
that I could hollow out the driver's door to build the cage.  Harry and
I corresponded by email about it and he looked at my car in September
1996.  To Harry's credit (even though I didn't like the result) he 
promptly put my rule interpretation to a vote of the PCA stewards, and 
reported that the door protection had to remain inside the panel.  He 
also pointed out, that if I was so concerned about my own safety, there 
were many more things that I could do, but hadn't done, to make my cage 
as safe as it could be. He noted that even though my cage met the 
minimums, the tubing could be stonger, and better placed.  And the main 
hoop could be higher against the roof, to give more head clearance.

Kind of an eye-opener for me (I hadn't really thought through these 
issues before), and I set about to build the safest cage that would be 
permitted in stock classes.  I went up 2 sizes on tubing over what was 
required, and used chromoly, which gave me about a triple safety factor. 
 It does have the NASCAR style driver protection, but only out to the 
door panel.  To get a bit more distance between me and the door, we've 
mounted the seat as far to the center of the car as possible.  My new 
cage is gusseted at the corners, and is cross-braced very substantially 
within the passenger compartment.  It probably weighs 30-50 lbs more 
than a full cage would (let alone a roll bar only) if I had used the 
minimum wall thickness, but we have to make weight anyway, so ballast 
that adds safety is the best kind. (I admit it is higher in the car than 
ideal, but it's stout where it needs to be.)  My welder also is a 
machinist and racer, and has been upside down in his quarter midget 
several times, so he also appreciates the value of a good build on a 
cage.

Anyway, it's good to hear that someone else thinks the PCA minimums are
not enough for himself.  While you're at it, you might tie the driver's
seat back to the cage as the SCCA rules require (PCA rules are silent on 
this).  



If you need specific questions answered, you can contact Harry Hall at
hhall@udel.edu

Good luck, and I hope to see you at a race.  Frequently the F and E
classes are in the same run group.

derivative number.
