Regarding "equal restraints": I believe seats count.  Let's face it - you're
changing the driver's side seat to a more-supportive one that's properly
slotted for the harness.  The stock seat does not provide for proper
orientation of either the shoulder belts or the sub belt.  So you no longer
have equal restraints.

Now having said that, I've certainly seen cars with this setup, and I've even
ridden with instructors at D.E. events who had this setup.  So its probably
more a matter of how tightly its enforced at a particular event.
(Of course the equal restraint condition only applies if you are actually
carrying a passenger).

You may want to consider buying a "sport" (aka "rec" or "road") seat rather
than a competition seat.  These generally have some adjustments (recline,
bolsters, etc) and should be more comfortable for long trips compared to a
fixed shell.
