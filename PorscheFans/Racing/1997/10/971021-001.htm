Lee:

Just a reminder... Each of those gussets can easily become a
meat-cleaver if your arm flails into it during a crash, so it's
important to heavily pad any gusset (and, of course, all other parts
of the roll cage) that your head or arms can POSSIBLY reach.

And while we're on the subject of excessive paranoia and rollcage 
padding...

1.  Make sure that you choose padding (and tie-wraps or whatever)
    that won't melt and/or burn in the unlikely event of a fire; I
    can imagine few things more uncomfortable than hanging upside
    down in a burning car while big globs of molten, flaming foam
    rubber drip onto me.

2.  When your helmet hits something hard (like, say, the roll cage),
    your odds of walking away without serious injury are inversely
    related to the rate of deceleration... That is, your head will
    hurt less if it slows gradually than if it stops suddenly.

    It goes without saying that the padding exists in order to slow
    your rate of deceleration when you hit it.  What may not be
    immediately obvious, though, is that you can make the padding's
    job easier by reducing the amount of time that your head's
    accelerating BEFORE it hits the padding.

    This means that the padding should be as close to your head (in
    your normal driving position) as possible.  For the BEST crash
    protection, you would ideally have the padding in contact with
    the full circumference of your helmet at all times... This isn't
    real practical, of course, since you have to drive the car, but
    you should think about building up the padding on the cage
    members closest to your head until it's as close as possible
    without interfering with helmet movement.

    I don't know what your 911 cage looks like, but in a 914, you
    can build up the padding on the rear hoop until it practically
    touches the back of your helmet, and build up the padding on the
    front-to-rear-hoop longitudinals until they're within an inch of
    the side of your helmet, without affecting your head's normal
    range of motion.  It's a little harder to build up the padding on
    the top and sides of the front hoop without interfering with your
    vision -- or, at least without making you FEEL that your vision's
    being interfered with -- but maybe it's easier on your 911.

    Also... The padding on your big anti-intrusion door bars,
    especially since your seat has been mounted as far as possible
    inboard of them, could probably also be bulked up in order to
    bring it closer to you and maybe save you from a broken arm or
    wrist.

3.  Most of us use "offset" rollbar padding that's thicker on one
    side than the other... The idea is that you can install it so
    the thick side is toward you, offering as much protection as
    possible, while the thin side will still fit in the
    presumably-as-narrow-as-possible gap between the tubing and the
    body of the car.

    This is fine, but -- especially if you stack multiple layers of
    padding on the side closest to you -- it's important to ensure
    that the padding won't rotate around the rollcage tubing.

    I still haven't come up with a good way to do this... If you
    overtighten the tie-wraps that hold the padding, they tend to
    cut into it -- and besides, they STILL don't do a great job of
    preventing rotation -- and gluing the padding to the cage with
    rubber cement, while it works, makes it difficult and messy to
    remove the padding for inspection or replacement or whatever.

If anyone has a better idea for preventing rotation, I'd like to
hear it.  Please keep the "you've got to be REALLY anal-retentive to
worry about padding rotation" responses to a minimum... I mean, I
SAID that this was all about "excessive paranoia".
