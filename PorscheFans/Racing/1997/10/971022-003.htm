Double stick tape, such as some kinds of carpet tape or mounting tape,
does a pretty good job of keeping the padding on the bars where you
want it, preventing rotation and sliding - you don't need it in more than a
few places, especially if you wrap with "racer" tape (which also does
away with need for tie wraps at all) after it is in place.  does take some
elbow grease to remove when time for that comes, though.

Simson (the helmet etc guy) was touting using crushable foam (as used
in helmets) instead of the usual closed cell foam as padding.  It has to
have a whole lot more energy absorbtion capacity than an equal
thickness of the stuff we all have been using, asymetric or not.  Is this
(or something like it) what the Probar Padding XLT Racer Wholesale sells
as "extremely energy absorbing without being hard as a brick" is made
of?  If it is, one might want to wrap it with racer's tape for its own
protection, as crushable foam can be penetrated pretty easily, and
poking it full of holes reduces its energy absorbption capacity (don't ask
me how I figured out why using my helmet as a convenient place to put a
bunch of car keys and similar objects wasn't such a good idea).
