Hi Wes,

The problems with the Weltmeister 28 mm front bar and the 944 control
arms are well known. The Weltmeister bar was designed for the post 85.5
cars which has the swaybar drop link connecting to the control arm in
the middle of the arm. When combined with stock springs, this places too
much load in the middle of the control arm causing it to break. Even
Fabcar arms are apparently not immune from this failure mode.

I wouldn't use the 28mm Weltmeister front bar on any car that hasn't had
the front springs upgraded first. But I think the best setup is to
upgrade the springs and torsion bars, use a Porsche-produced front bar,
and then use an adjustable rear bar, such as the Weltmeister 22mm bar to
balance the car.

Regarding autocrossing with it, there isn't much choice in the stock car
classes. You are very limited in what you can do to eliminate the body
roll. I'd be *very* careful of any potholes and the like, and I'd
inspect the control arms every event.
