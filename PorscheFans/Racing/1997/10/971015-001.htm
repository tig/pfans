Mike,

This is fine. You can used a race seat with 5 point on the drivers side and
a stock seat with 6 point on the passenger side. The belts are the restraints.

Good luck,
Cal

My thinking was to have the stock seat on the drivers
side for the long drive, then I arive at the track, I put the stock seat on
the passenger side, and put the race seat on the driver side, that way I
have the best of both worlds.

My question, is Will this be allowed? The rules say equal "restraints" for
driver and passenger, and I read that to mean equal belts. am I mistaken?
Will I be given a hard time by the organizers? Just trying to keep my costs
down is all. I plan of course to put full 6 point harnesses on both sides,
but if I can save $600 by buying one less seat, THAT would be very nice.

Thanks for your time.
