Actually, I have to replace the stock seat as it doesn't support the
shoulder harness properly, so the problem will be minimized.

I have an old Recaro rally seat (looks like a 914 seat, with a separate
headrest) that I plan to use. I should be able to bolt it in very low. The
only issue with it is where to run the anti-sub straps (6-point) - there's
no hole in the seat. (Allowed) ideas anyone? "Normally" the straps just run
to the front of the seat and then are anchored to the floor somewhere
underneath the seat, but I see the rules don't seem to allow this (The
"crush" sentence). Is mounting the anti-sub anchors just forward of the lap
belt anchors allowed? Depending on how you want to argue it, this is a
worse solution (I know the I can't use the inboard seatbelt anchor for
anything.) Or can I cut a hole in the seat?

Geez I'm just full of questions... I wish there was a Club Racing FAQ...

TIA,
Craig.
