I'd just like to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my question
about roll cages. I appreciate it very much.

Now I have to work with my fabricator to come up with a design that
complies with the "No suspension pickup" guideline. This is going to
require some thought as I was originally going to run pipes back from the
main hoop to the rear shock towers :-) and then run a bar across the towers
:-), and then triangulate that rectangle. So much for *that* idea. (FWIW,
that's how my rally car is set up)

I have access to a Rothman's turbo cup car with the Matter cage - I'll have
a look at that one, maybe get an idea or two.

Thanks again,
Craig.
