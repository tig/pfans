Jim,

I have been actively running in SCCA for the past 5 years, and in Porsche
Club racing for the same length of time.

I have ran in the Rennen Festival at blackhawk farm twice, and have loved
it. your format of 2 8-12 lap sprint races on Saturday and an hour enduro on
Sunday is fantastic. 

I have heard rumors, however, that due to low turnout this year you
(milwaukee region) is thinking about not running it again. that would be a
shame, and I have an idea to greatly increase participation:

Quite simply, recognize full competition PCA licenses, just as you do
midwest counsel and others.Of course they would have to join SCCA, but the
fee is negligable next to the cost of tires<G>. Then put add for it in some
reqion newsletters. There are at least 200 racers in the Wisconsin,
Illinois, Indiana region. Almost all of them would welcome the chance to
race in other venues.

The only problem is that, in general, Porsches are not classified anywhere
(except mabye ITE). If you set up a porsche only run group, open to ALL
porsches, I am willing to bet at least 40 entrants. (I would run in both
this group and ITS.) That would ease the phobia twords us "crazy' SCCA drivers.

Even though I am a Chicago region SCCA member I would be willing to act as a
point of contact for any licensed porsche racer who was interested. 

Please give this idea some thought. Rennen is to much fun to allow to die,
and PCA is to big a source of potential racers to overlook. 

I am pretty sure this is being sucessfully done in other regions now.

Scott Sanda
