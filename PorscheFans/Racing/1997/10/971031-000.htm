Safety is hugely important. So is performance, and the two go together hand in 
hand. As a new subscriber to this digest, I am surprised at the quantity of 
queries from drivers who are not placing a high enough priority on safety in 
their Porsches. That is my opinion, and here is more of same:
Preserving "originality" when race-preparing a car- even for stock(!)- can be 
a misguided objective. Watch out for this trap! Seats, harnesses, belts, rock 
chips, body-flex cracks, bushing fatigue, possible contact (it can happen), 
are all parts of racing. If a roll bar seems like a "big enough modification", 
consider that a roll-cage only entails two more contact points. And a cage can 
have removable side bars (mine), or even no side bars.
Stock class Porsches are posting some extremely quick lap times, and often 
while running in close wheel-to-wheel proximity with other cars. And stock 
class races might include drivers with lesser levels of experience. This is 
not a knock on stock, just a thought that new racers often start in stock. So 
the talent and equipment range is very high in stock, which enables some of 
the closest racing(!!!) in PCA and would appear to enable some rookie-related 
risk, though I have not seen data to support a higher level of risk in any one 
area of PCA. 
"Stock" cars normally have more crash protection remaining in the car than the 
GT cars (fiberglass, carbon..), which is comforting, but speeds and 
competition are extremely high, and crash safety needs to be up to snuff. 
Speeds example- The top C and D cars frequently run quicker than half of the 
GT car field. At IRP, the top E, F and G(!) cars would have beaten half of the 
GT car field, based upon lap times.
Make your car prep plans appropriately to suit your goals. First, define 
goals. Consider that if you are afraid of losing the "originality" of your 
car, perhaps it is not the right car for racing. I started with a near perfect 
street car, and eased into the track modifications, first with semi-stiff 
bars, later with solid bushings,... so I am doubled-up or tripled-up on labor 
in the process of finding the setup. The gist of this shared story is to say 
that my opinions are based upon experience.
Consider- Compromise track preparation will produce a compromise track car 
that will not be race competitive, but will be devalued as a streeter. This 
car will never be in its element. That is an important concept to grasp.
Non-compromise track mods (cage, seats, full suspension, lowering, 
allignment,...) can make a car class-competitive and make it a more 
exhilarating driving experience when street-driven. This car is no longer 
cushy & comfi, but I like the track behavior and I like the precise-ness of 
the car when streeting. 
Exceptions abound. eg. I kept the "chin spoiler" instead of going to a full 
air dam and splitter for driveway accessability, a near must-have for street.
Plan your car-build wisely.
