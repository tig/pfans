I  have watched with interest the recent thread on cage requirements in PCA
racing.  I am very new to racing and obviously do not have the experience to
argue much.  However, it seems to me that most folks think we are talking
about a safety issue and I feel that we are really talking about the future
of club racing.  My recent initiation into club racing may make my comments
concerning getting started more meaningful than my meager experience would
normally allow.

Adding a cage to a car is the final step that usually separates a streetable
car from a track only car.  A hoop generally does not move a car off the
street,  particularly a roll bar like mine that is completely bolt
in  and fits flush against the head liner.    If a cage had been required, I
believe that many people racing today would not be involved.  If new folks
find it much harder to get started does that not effect the future and
direction of club racing?  I know that I would not be involved if a cage was
an initial requirement.  I was not sure enough that racing was for me to
invest in a track only car for my first race.  I know many people who are or
were in the same boat.  As it is, I race a car that is driven mostly on the
street.  I am not alone.  Of the 5 cars, all 911's,  that went to Heartland
from this area 4 did not have cages,  Three cars from the group are driven
regularly on the street.  No, we didn't win, but we sure had fun.    I
realize, if I expect to win,  I will have to change to more of a track car
with fewer compromises in suspension set up and street safety.  That
decision will be based now on experience rather than speculation since I was
able to get started with minor changes to my existing car.

Street safety?   You guys with cages who do drive on the street and are very
concerned with safety always wear your harness and helmet since you have
introduced many hard points to your interior for you and your passengers
that would not be normally allowed in a street car don't you?  The cage is
part of a safety system.  You have you heard about the guy in the Miata with
the steel roll bar behind his head when he got rear ended at a stop light?

There are many people who have to drive quite a way to go racing and
therefore are only able to go 3 times a year.  Wouldn't a track only car
requirement make 3 weekends a year a little harder to justify.

I have been involved with other organizations that have improved themselves
out of existence.  If the car requirements become the same as SCCA doesn't
the SCCA style race soon follow?   One might reason that there is really no
reason for the 13  -  13 rule and therefore trading a little paint won't
hurt since it is less likely to get someone hurt.   Then since the racing is
the same as SCCA why don't we petition the SCCA to set up some classes for
us and do away with PCA racing?  I have a good friend that just finished his
first season of SCCA SSB racing which is like our lettered classes except
the only change allowed is the mandatory cage.   He got all 4 fenders at
least once.  The left front at  least 3 times.  Two front suspensions on the
left side....  Well you get the picture.  Maybe the best safety device going
is the nut behind the wheel.

I agree that a cage is safer, but I will bet that I can show you a way to
make your car safer too.  Especially if safety is the issue and not
performance.  How much is enough?  The ultimate safety device would be to
not start the car.

A rule like this may make more sense in the GT classes where the majority of
the cars are track only already.  I believe it will ultimately harm the
lettered classes.
