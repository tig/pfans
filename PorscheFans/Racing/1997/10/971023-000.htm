This is a somewhat lengthy story of my first hill climb which I entered
last weekend with my 1983 911SC, which is bone stock, except for the brake
pads, and the tires. I sent it to a couple of friends, and it was suggested
to me that I post it to the race list as well. So without further boring
discourse, here is the report:

Well folks, as most of you know this past weekend was my first attempt at
competitive hill climbing. The event took place at Mt. Philo, in Charlotte
Vt. The event runs up a 1.1 mile mountain road, and although Technically
"paved",  at some points we are REALLY stretching the definition of
"pavemement"! The raod was breaking up so badly in areas that there were
littereally piles of "marbles" which consisted of pavement bits in many of
the courses' most tretcherous corners. The upper portion of the road is
litterally only slightly wider than the car, it really should be classified
as a bike path, narrow you could say, and lined the entire way by
trees...BIG trees!

So saturday the event starts no less than 3 hours late, which meant cars
were not on the hill until 11:00am, needless to say, folks were NOT happy!
considering each run lasts only about a minute and a half, and you only can
hope to get FIVE in a day at best, when you loose 3 hours of your day, it
makes it just that much more difficult, especially for a rookie that does
not know the course, (me!). 

Well my first timed run was around 1:25.xx which meant nothng to me, as I
had no point of reference, so I went to check the time sheet. the time was
OK for my class, and since I was not there to win, I was not too
concerend....then I noticed what I was racing against! Among the others in
my class, (including one other 911SC) was a 1993 TWIN TURBO RX7, UMM HELLO
the car makes nearly 100 more HP, and is virtually no heavier, AND on top
of that, it was being driven by a 10 year veteran, and multi time former
champion, Oh yeah this made me REAL happy, COME ON, give me a break! Well,
when saturday was over, I had put in a 1:22.9x and fast time in my class
was a 1:21.04 by a Shelby CSX (I think) and the RX7 had put in a 1:21.4x. I
had made all of three timed runs that day, each one was faster than the
previous, but then everyone was doing that. I went home and thought about
how I wanted to approach the following day. When I signed up for the event
I had told myself it was just a fun event, and an oppertunity to get some
seat time, and drive fast in a somewhat controlled enviroment. Which
reminds me, let me take just a second to talk about this "controlled"
enviroment. there are NO gard-rails, there is NO run-off AT ALL. the entire
course is lined with trees, and Saturday afternoon saw the first accident.
An early model RX7 went off, and hit a tree HARD folding the car severly,
the driver was unhurt, but the car was a complete total, the destruction
was disturbing, amazing what a large tree will do to a moving car. The next
was worse. A VW Scirroco went off, and banged the front corner pretty well,
bending the wheel back, and twisting the front end. A friend of mine took
his truck and trailer down to load up the car so that they could take it
home for her, while loading it, they turned the ignition on so they could
try and turn the wheel a bit. The ensuing fire burned the car beyond
recognition, NOTHING remained of the car, the tires were gone, the
interioir, gone, there was not a single bolt on that car that was
salvagable, it was just awefull. They tried in vain to put the fire out,
but after no less than 5 or 6 extinguishers, the fire would just start
again from a different local, and all they could do was stand and wait for
the fire dept to arive.

So on Sunday I had decided that I COULD make a run at going for the top
three spots in my class, my plan was to go out early, make a HARD run, and
see if it would hold up for the day. I was getting more and more concerned
about the whole idea of driving this event as, the danger of it was really
starting to hit home. On my first run I put in a 1:19.41!!! Hey 3.5 seconds
off my best from yeterday, things were REALLY looking up!!! The RX7 went
out and did another 1:21.xx on his first run, and the shelby did a 1:21.xx
also, I was leading the class, BUT there were two runs each to go. I
decided to wait and see how the other guys did on there second run before I
went out again, if I was lucky I would not have to run again that day. That
mornings run had been pretty harry. The second run for the RX7 was a heart
breaking 1:19.27 UGGGGGGH .14 seconds, MAN how could he do that to me?!?!?
Then of course we broke for lunch before I could get back out for my second
run, so I had to sit and wait for an hour and a half to get my next run in,
I HATE waiting!! Finally my second run was starting, I tried a couple of
new things, and it paid off, I put in a 1:18.67!! WOOOO HOOOOO He was right
behind me on his third run, and only clocked in a 1:19.7 YAAAAAA! At that
point it was not expected that there would be time for a fourth run, so he
came up to me and congratulated me on the win, as no one else in the class
was close to the two of us.....THEN the announcement, a FOURTH run would be
allowed, UGGGGH No way, it aint fair, I had the emotional high of winning,
and now I had to see what would happen AGAIN. He ran to his car, and since
I had only done TWO runs at this point, I ran over to mine just to get in
queue in case. As it turned out he was first up the hill, and I was one car
after him. At the start line I asked them to tell me his time, so I could
know if I really had to make this run or not....They would not tell me,
DAMN...OK lets hang it out, here we go. With tires spinning, (accompanied
by the pungent smell of clutch smoke, oh thats got to be good for the car,
SORRY!) I screamed up the hill, deciding to push just a little harder,
(hmmm do you recall this was going to be a "fun run" event, I was NOT going
to try and win? Yah, that really lasted!) The run was good, very good, a
1:17.07! BUT they hit me with a 10 second penalty for jumping the start,
DAMN!!!!

Well, as it turned out it did not matter......The RX7 had only been able to
manage a 1:18.82.

I WON!!!!!! By only .15 seconds, I had taken the class win YEEEEAH!!!!
WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO I was so happy, I could not believe it. This was the
first time *I* had ever won ANYTHING by myself, EVER!!! It was a fantastic
feeling. At the awards cerimony, there were lots of hoots and hollars as
they announced that a rookie had won Class U2, very cool, a really great
feeling.

I must say though that I will not be doing another Hill Climb, the risks
were SO great, and although the reward for me was HUGE, there were several
times that I was wondering if my car was going home on a trailer. I LOVE to
go fast, but I REALLY prefer some room for error, I am not perfect, and I
do make mistakes from time to time, I NEED runnoff!!!

Thanks for listening, hope you enjoyed it! :-))
