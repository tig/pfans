Bryan Henderson <bhender@email.msn.com> wrote a thoughtful, thorough 
series of comments about roll-cage requirements, bits and pieces of 
which I'll be quoting below:

    Usually, yes... But Hank Watts, I, and lots of others own cars
    with both a stereo AND a full cage.

    A full cage can be a bolt-in installation, too (or at least the
    door bars can be bolted in and out), and most of them fit just as
    close to the perimeter of the cockpit as rollbars do.

    Admittedly, it's a LITTLE difficult to get into and out of a
    cage-equipped car -- you have to pull your knees up toward your
    chest and be careful not to scrape your back or ankle on the
    door-bar stubs -- but even women in short skirts can learn to
    manage it without abandoning all modesty.

    Yeah, but if enough new folks find it hard to walk with a broken
    back caused by insufficient crash protection, I think Club
    Racing's future might be affected even more.

    I can see your point, and most PCA regions allow first-timers to
    run in time trials (not races) without a cage, rollbar, or even
    a five-point harness for just that reason... It allows those
    people to try before they buy.

    RACING, however, is kinda different.  Personally, I feel that if
    you don't have the financial wherewithal to do it safely, you
    shouldn't be doing it at all; ownership of a street Porsche
    doesn't automatically confer upon you the "right" to race it in
    an unsafe configuration.

    I don't believe that special dispensation should be granted to
    people who simply can't afford to properly outfit a Porsche for
    club racing... I mean, do you think that someone with a
    perfectly-safe shitbox IT car -- no offense to list members who
    also drive IT shitboxes -- should be allowed to drive it in a PCA
    club race until he's sure that he wants to invest in a Porsche?

    The arguments against roll-cage requirements sound a lot, to me,
    like the arguments against mandatory insurance coverage for
    street cars.  "But it discriminates against people who can't
    AFFORD insurance", they whine...

    Anyway...

    This is a REALLY good point; I'm glad you brought it up.

    Personally, I always wear the harness when I'm driving my 914
    on the street -- mostly because the car doesn't have stock belts
    any more -- and I keep the rollbar padding on the cage, too.

    I don't wear my helmet on the street, of course, but I HAVE
    thought about it... Even went to the trouble of finding out
    whether it's legal in California (it isn't).

    Some time ago, the conversation on the Acura NSX mailing list
    turned from its usual mindless drivel to the question of whether
    5-point harnesses were appropriate for cars that were driven on
    the street.  This isn't EXACTLY the right Porschefans sub-list
    for it -- it probably belongs on one of the non-racing sublists
    -- but here's what I had to say on the subject... I hope you find
    it interesting:

    ------ Forwarded Message Follows ------

    There are a whole lot of good reasons for installing 5-point
    belts in your car; if you're involved in a relatively-minor
    crash, for instance, they'll hold you in the seat (so you can
    still reach the steering wheel and pedals) better than the stock
    belts will.

    They also look totally bitchin'.

    However...

    1.  5- or 6-point harnesses will keep you and your wife
        securely fastened in your seats, but ONLY IF THEY'RE USED
        PROPERLY.  To be effective, harnesses must be very tight; if
        you can only latch them yourself with difficulty and after
        exhaling, they're just about tight enough.

        People used to wonder why I always wore a suit when I drove
        my harness-equipped Porsche to work.  The reason was simple:
        I needed a jacket to cover the harness-generated wrinkles in
        the shoulders of my shirts.  If you and your wife are at all
        concerned with how your clothes look when you get out of the
        car, you'll never tighten the harnesses enough, and you'll
        end up with LESS security than you have with the stock belts.

        Related to this is the fact that racing harnesses are
        uncomfortable or awkward for many women to wear... Large
        breasts get in the way, and pregnmant women DEFINITELY
        shouldn't use them.  If someone can't tighten the belts
        without discomfort, she simply WON'T tighten them.

        Also, many people can't STAND being tightly strapped into the
        seat for any length of time.  I've taken cross-country trips
        in the Porsche and didn't feel very uncomfortable, but I've
        had passengers who started to feel clautrophobic after only a
        few minutes in the car.

    2.  Even if you properly tighten the belts, they still stretch. 
        Nylon belts can stretch up to 20% in a severe crash, so even
        if you're wearing tight racing harnesses, your upper body is
        likely to move forward a few inches.

        This is not necessarily a bad thing... The whole idea of
        crash-survivability revolves around decelerating your body
        (relatively) gradually.  Kevlar harnesses are available from
        Stand 21 (and maybe from other manufacturers, as well), but
        because they have no stretch to speak of, they're dangerous in
        most tube-frame cars or really stiff single-seat racers.
        They'd be less dangerous in a street car with crush zones, but
        you should still expect a broken collarbone if you crash while
        wearing a Kevlar harness.

    3.  Although nylon belts will stretch a little, your neck will
        stretch A LOT.  Paul Tracy, who was belted very securely
        into his Indy car at the time, HIT HIS HEAD ON THE STEERING
        WHEEL when he crashed at Indianapolis a couple years ago.

        The stock three-point inertial-reel belt will allow your
        shoulders to move forward significantly farther than will
        racing harnesses.  You may bang your nose on the steering
        wheel while wearing EITHER set of belts, but if you're
        wearing the stock belts, your shoulders won't still be held
        near the seatback at the time.

        For those of us whose necks aren't as strong as Paul Tracy's,
        this is a good thing.

    4.  In the very unlikely event that an object is coming at your
        windshield with enough warning for you to get your head out
        of its way, the stock belts will let you lean over or duck.
        Racing harnesses, on the other hand, will keep your face
        right in the line of fire.

    Like most vehicle modifications, you need to remember that
    what's good for a race car is not necessarily good for a street
    car.

    So...

    I guess I agree with you that racing-type modifications to street
    cars can often compromise street safety.

    I just CAN'T agree, however, that this is a good reason to allow
    street cars to race WITHOUT those modifications.  If someone
    wants to race, I think he needs to commit to the cost of safety
    modifications as part of the package.

    -Andy

    P.S.  For what it's worth, I worked out the cost of racing a
          Porsche and decided that for what I wanted to do, I
          couldn't afford it.  I bought my NSX right after making
          that decision... I've owned it for about eighteen months,
          and I'm just about at the break-even point where the cost
          of the car balances the cost of a year and a half of
          racing.
