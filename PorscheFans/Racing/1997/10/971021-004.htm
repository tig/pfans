>>As an SCCA Scrutineer, I can tell you why sitting on the "crotch/sub"
belt is NOT safe.  The purpose of the sub strap is not to hold you
from sliding forward under the lap belts.  It is supposed to keep the
lap belts from riding up the body when the shoulder straps are pulled
tight.  Ideally you want the belt to come up through the seat.  Since
we don't all have racing seats, and we don't want to cut up our
everyday seats, a compromise has to be made.  On two different
vehicles I have had, I mounted the sub strap just behind a vertical
line from the front edge of the seat when it's back as far as it will
go.  Then I adjusted the length of the belt to be in the proper
position when the other belts are pulled tight.

By routing the belts from the back through the slot in between the
seat cushion and the seat back, there is nothing to hold you down.  In
a front end collision, the belts can stretch 6 inches or more.  The
shoulder belt has a tendency to come down, and the sub strap will come
up as your body moves forward, causing possible spinal compression.
=46or example;  put your finger in a rubber band and pull it.  You'll
notice how the rubber band pinches down on the top and bottom around
your finger.  If the sub belt is mounted in an ideal manner, it will
be in a straight line from the point it comes down over your
shoulders, to where the sub belt attaches on the floor.  Forming a
barrier to prevent your body from going forward into the windshield.>>

I find I have to disagree with this. The stock seat will deform and
provide even more room for movement than sitting on the sub belt. In
both cases the belts are subject to stretching. The sub belt must be
mounted at or behind the lap belts to be effective.

Furthermore, the sub belt's purpose is not to keep the lap belt from
moving up when you tighten your harness straps. It is to keep the lap
belt in position and prevent 'submarining' in the event of a crash. That
is why is is call a sub belt.

I find it even more disturbing that a number of individuals use
harnesses and lap belts with no sub belt at all! This is very dangerous!
*Any* sub belt attachment method is better than no sub belt.

To: PORSTURBO@aol.com; Racing@PorscheFans.com

The recent thread on roll cages has brought up some questions for me, as I am 
currently building a 914 for J stock.  The rule book gives minimum specs for 
roll cages (forget roll bars), but no limitations on the number of attachment 
points.  What is the spirit of the rule?  How much can I use the cage to stiffen 
up the car?  Is the cage limited to the passenger compartment, as stated in Lee 
Wilkins' post on 10/20?  If so, I missed this in the rule book.  I'd like to run 
braces from the points where the rear main hoop braces attach to the firewall, 
back to the wheel wells to stiffen up the whole structure.  Is this possible and 
remain in the stock classes?
