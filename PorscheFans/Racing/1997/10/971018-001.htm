I just bought myself a 944S2 and am thinking about setting it up for club
racing in Class F, given the possibility of events close to me next year :-)

Now a local club racer (944 in class I, with the Autopower roll bar) has
told me that if I put a roll cage in the car it can't be welded in. It has
to be bolted in, and in such a way that the cage can slide about. The
reasoning is that the cage will unfairly stiffen the structure of the car.

I know this sounds ridiculous (to me, anyway), and I can't find any mention
of such a thing in the rules, but I also have no reason to not believe my
friend. Has anyone heard of this?

(And yes, I know all one needs is a roll bar. My *street* car has a 13
point SCCA ProRally-legal cage in it. I *like* cages. I've been upside down
in a car before and believe me, a cage is a *very* *good* *thing*. I don't
feel comfortable racing on a track without one, 13/13 rule or not.)

Also, the rules also state the main hoop of a roll bar (and, I'm assuming
by extension, the main hoop of a roll cage) must be at least 2" above the
driver's helmet. It isn't stated, but I'm guessing this must be in
reference to open cars (like it is in other rule books I've seen). My
head/helmet is jammed up against the sunroof as it is...

Thanks in advance for any response,
Craig.

Looking for a cheap tow vehicle/winter beater... Hmmm. Maybe the 924S...
