Sounds like we're in the same hot oil (sorry).  I also have a Terbatrol 
(4-rows)
and from my research, I've been told that its finned design is not as efficient
as a radiator-style cooler for optimal cooling.   I've also been told 
that we need a
minimum of 25rows.   The cooler needs to mounted such that at least 1-1.5"
of air space exists behind it for the hot air to exhaust itself or else 
the air will
not flow through effectively.  Also, the cooler needs to be blocked off, top,
bottom and sides to force all the air through and not around it.  I have
a Ruf polyu front spoiler and the space is only about 2 7/8" D x 7" H x 26" W
so it's tight in there.   I'm considering keeping the Terbatrol and run 
a smaller
cooler in front in series.  Dale at Turbatronics suggested this, maybe 
with this
approach a smaller front cooler can do the job.  BTW, they use AN-12 fittings.

Dale and Chris Brown suggested lose the washer bottle in the left fender
well and add a second cooler there like the factory did in newer cars 
but I think
for track use, the lack of airflow is still a problem.

Does anyone use a front spoiler-mounted cooler with top fittings?   Pegasus
carries a Mocal 25-row with top fittings for $175.    I believe this is 
the same
brand sold by Earl's.
Is it a bad idea buying a used cooler not knowing its history?  I'd get it
cleaned and pressure-tested anyway.

The search for better cooling continues....
