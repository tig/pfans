P'Fans,
I've seen numerous questions and comments about stock seats vs. aftermarket
ones slotted for shoulder harnesses.  Unmodified, I believe the stock seats
are a hazard with shoulder harnesses, for both the driver AND the
instructor/passenger.  For the track, you can't beat a quality competition
seat.  However, for many of us who drive our cars daily as well as on the
track, a competition seat (or seats, if you carry passengers at the track) is
impractical unless you swap it in and out ( a PITA).  In addition, good
aftermarket seats are expensive.

Some may cringe at this suggestion, but on my last two cars (944 and 951S) I
slotted the stock seats to allow the harnesses to pass through the seatback.
As bad as it sounds, it actually looks fine, and works very well to locate
the harnesses properly for all but the very tall. I don't want to gross
everybody out, so if you're interested in how I did it, let me know and I'll
send you a description.
