I purchased my first set of R-1's earlier this summer.  After three Dr Ed
events (one was rain all weekend), and three auto-x, I'm showing cord on the
inside half of the fronts.  I rotated tire positions (l and r) between Dr Ed
events.  I was using stock suspension settings, until the last Dr Ed I had
stock suspension settings on my '87 951.  Prior to last event, I had -1d
camber and 1/16" toe (Jim Pashas recommendations) dialed in.  My questions
are:

Is this wear rate normal?

Is it normal to wear out the inside first?  I would have thought the outside
would go first.

TIA,
Jeff Fortenbery
'87 951 (corded fronts)
'77 911S (street tires)
