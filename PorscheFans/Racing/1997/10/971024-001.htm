Um, okay, I think I started the thread, so I'll give you a reply :-)

First of all, I was NOT asking for/proposing/thinking about a rules change.
The current rule's spirit that a cage is a recommended thing is fine with
me. As I said in my original post, my friend has a bar. It's his
responsibility to provide the protection he's happy with, and that's fine.

Similarly, if I'm going to be on the track, I know I'll feel more
comfortable if I have a roll cage (among other things). That's my
I'm-just-an-anal-retentive-kind-of-guy choice. My friend had some
misconceptions about the restriction applying to cages in stock classes
which have been cleared up, thanks to this list.  

I can understand that many people don't want to have a roll cage in their
street car. That is their (and your) choice. I certainly didn't mean to
imply having a roll cage is something everyone should have for their street
car. 

(FYI, I have a cage in my (non-Porsche) street/lapping day car because it
is an old rally car. It no longer has stock seatbelts or seats so I wear a
6-point harness (mercifully a cam-lock) all the time, as does my passenger
(the back seat has been removed). All the hard points are covered with one,
and in parts two, layers of hard foam, and the seats are mounted *very*
low, much to the chagrin of shorter passengers who find themselves staring
at the dash. :-))

Many of the people who have posted have expressed their opinions about
having a cage installed. Two (I think) of the people who responded to me
have said that a rule change requiring cages may be in the offing. Both
seem to have something to do with PCA racing officially. Both implied that
this was an information item. I'll bet that it has nothing to do with
changing the 13/13 rule or the spirit of club racing. I believe it *does*
have to do with safety, only. I also got the impression that current club
racers like yourself would have the opportunity to comment come the new
year. No doubt this proposal will prompt much discussion. :-)
