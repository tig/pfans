In reply to the email about weld in versus bolt in roll cages, I believe
what the friend was referring to was the old rule that made a distinction
between welded in and bolted in cages in the "super" classes, along with the
distinction between slicks and DOT tires.  That distincction is gone.  I
don't see anything in the rule about not being able to weld in a cage in a
stock class car, although if there was an excessive amount of frame
strengthening with it, there may be some challenge to it.  Howver, as long
as you are simply welding in a normal cage, should be no problem.
With regard to the roll bar, I'd stick with a cage, particularly in a 944 as
there have been reports of windshield pillars folding on those. IN addtion,
the national committee is having very preliminary discussions about making
roll cages mandatory in all classes.  I emphasis, discussing, with the rule
not going into effect until at least 1/1/99 at the earliest.  YEs, there are
arguments both ways and we'll all get our opportunity to make them.
I'd be concerned about a seating position where there isn't sufficient space
between the top of your helmet and the top of your roll bar/cage.  The issue
is spinal compression in a roll over, not a pretty possiblity.  I'd suggest
lowering your seat, which serves the dual purpose of getting your 180+
pounds or whatever lower in the center of gravitiy in the car.  -Bruce Boeder
