It's Sanda, but please, address me as Scott since we are all supposed to be
friends here.

I disagree, with a good driver, a very well prepped car will be faster than
a poorly prepared car.
With a less experianced/novice driver, you are absolutly correct.
Preparation will not usually make a driver noticeably faster if he/she is
not pushing the limits of the lesser prepared car. Of course there are
always exceptions in both cases (A certain Ferarri F1 driver comes to mind).

I am sure you are correct, I made the  mistake of equating preparation in
and of itself to speed.

I have seen an Email from Mr. Fogle to a friend of mine who asked for more
detail on the car. First and foremost Mr. Fogle seems to be primarily
interested in SCCA (as am I). However, the car as he described it is not
legal for either ITS or Class I. 

These are his own words, if the copy of the original Email was in fact from
Mr. Fogle:

Flywheel and Euro pistons make it illegal for ITS, Flywheel, pistons, block
modifications and coatings make it illegal for class I

The truth is that in SCCA ITS and PCA class I the pistons and flywheel would
never get protested, and might not even get noticed.

By the description he has on hell of a well prepared car, and it would seem,
not having actually seen the car, to be an excellent buy.

It is not, however, a "most prepped I car"
