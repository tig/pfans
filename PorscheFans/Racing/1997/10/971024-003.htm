Steve Russakov asked about the merits of chromolly vs. mild steel.  I 
asked a lot of these questions last year, and here is what I found.

Most (maybe all) of the NASCAR cages are SEAMLESS (not DOM, or drawn 
over mandrel) mild steel.  The concensus (from a few folks such as Tom 
Hintz, and another person, who wrote me a very informative note) is that 
mild steel has a slight bit of give, or deflection, whereas chromolly is 
brittle.  They select mild steel over chromolly for a reason, not 
because the NASCAR guys can't afford it.

There is no difference in weight of mild steel vs. chromolly on the same 
tubing size and thickness.

All of the above having been said, my fabricator was a strong believer 
in the chromolly cage, having raced circle tracks and been upside down 
in his car several times.  He tried to explain the metallurgical 
principles behind his preference, but I was lost after awhile.  I ended 
up going with chromolly based on his recommendation, but used the same 
tubing size and thickness that I would have used with mild steel (I 
already was using a size larger than required for my car), which he told 
me would be the strength equivalent of moving up one size.

If anyone in the Dallas area is interested in having a cage built by my 
guy, his name is John Ray, at 214-357-0545.  I have no business 
relationships with him except that he's fabricated several items for me 
and I've always found him honest and reasonable.  I'm very pleased with 
the construction, the attention to detail and the price.  Everyone who 
has looked at this cage has been impressed with the build quality.

Hope this helps.
