There was a thread last week about mounting sub-straps in a car.  I
wrote this last week, but the server bounced it, so I'm trying to send
it again.

Here is my opinion of the sub-strap mounting issue.

(get on soap box)

As an SCCA Scrutineer, I can tell you why sitting on the "crotch/sub"
belt is NOT safe.  The purpose of the sub strap is not to hold you
from sliding forward under the lap belts.  It is supposed to keep the
lap belts from riding up the body when the shoulder straps are pulled
tight.  Ideally you want the belt to come up through the seat.  Since
we don't all have racing seats, and we don't want to cut up our
everyday seats, a compromise has to be made.  On two different
vehicles I have had, I mounted the sub strap just behind a vertical
line from the front edge of the seat when it's back as far as it will
go.  Then I adjusted the length of the belt to be in the proper
position when the other belts are pulled tight.

By routing the belts from the back through the slot in between the
seat cushion and the seat back, there is nothing to hold you down.  In
a front end collision, the belts can stretch 6 inches or more.  The
shoulder belt has a tendency to come down, and the sub strap will come
up as your body moves forward, causing possible spinal compression.
=46or example;  put your finger in a rubber band and pull it.  You'll
notice how the rubber band pinches down on the top and bottom around
your finger.  If the sub belt is mounted in an ideal manner, it will
be in a straight line from the point it comes down over your
shoulders, to where the sub belt attaches on the floor.  Forming a
barrier to prevent your body from going forward into the windshield.

My student for a drivers ed this weekend was getting his car
inspected, and had his sub-belt mounted through the seat.  I told him
to either move the sub-belt attachment to the front, or we were going
to use the stock seat belts.  I was not going to ride in a car that I
felt was unsafe.  If others feel this attachment method is OK, more
power to them.  I will not use it on any of my cars, nor will I ride
in and/or instruct any that do.

My safety and the safety of my passengers is more important then not
wanting to drill a hole in the floor of my car.  My first track car, a
91 Eagle Talon AWD, I was able to mount the sub-strap to the studs in
the floor used to mount the front of the seat.  My Porsches have all
been early 70s, dedicated track cars, and I bolted  the sub-strap
right to the floor.   I am not familiar enough with the newer cars to
suggest a non-destructive mounting point.  Just remember that safety
is the most important issue.  It's easier to weld up a hole in the
floor then fix a broken back.

This message was not meant to offend or put anybody down.  It's merely
my opinion of a subject I feel very strong about.
