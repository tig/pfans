    Mark:

    I've got a bolt-in Autopower cage in my 914... No experience
    with Stable Energies.

> I'm concerned about: Material type(DOM,ERW)

    To me, DOM seems much more suitable than ERW... I'm just not
    comfortable with rollcage tubing that has a weld seam running
    along its entire length.

> location points(floor or door sill)

    In my 914, there are four mounting plates welded to the
    doorsills; the cage bolts to those four plates and to the stock
    shoulder-belt mounting points on the B-pillars.  I don't know
    how Autopower's 911 cages are mounted.

> fit

    Perfect on my car, but mine was the first bolt-in cage they'd
    done for a 914, and they installed it themselves.  I have no
    experience with their "off the rack" cages, but they certainly
    don't have a reputation for building cages that don't fit.

> additional features(door bars, etc.)

    The door bars bolt in and out real easily; I leave them out of
    the car for street driving.  When they're installed, they DO
    make it a little difficult to get in and out of the car, but when
    they're removed, the door area is hardly obstructed at all...
    You just have to remember not to scrape your back or bang your
    knee against the two short tube-stubs to which the door bars
    normally attach.

    Of course, your entry/exit technique has to be modified a little
    bit even when the door bars are out of the car, since the
    roll-cage's front hoop comes straight down to the doorsill from
    the dashboard.  This means that you need to sorta pull your
    knees up toward your chest in order for your feet to clear that
    front hoop, but no one who's ever attempted to get in my car has
    failed.

    Some people have modified their door bars so that they swivel at
    the front (where they normally  bolt to the front hoop) and
    latch at the rear (where they normally bolt to the rear hoop).
    This allows you to leave the door bars in all the time, and just
    swing them out like the doors whenever you want to get in and out
    (or they can even swing WITH the doors, if you strap the doors
    and bars together).

    The 914 cage also comes with a diagonal brace that goes from the
    center of the rear hoop to the passenger-side doorsill... I leave
    IT out of the car for street driving, too.

> PCA and SCCA approved.

    You should read the rule books and make sure, but Autopower and
    the other manufacturers have a pretty clear idea of what's
    required by the rules... It IS their business, after all.  Some
    sanctioning bodies may require a couple of additional mounting
    points (maybe at dashboard level on the front hoop), but I think
    six points is generally ok for most.

    Autopower does good work, the prices are reasonable, they've
    been in business for twenty or thirty years... I have nothing
    bad to say about them.
