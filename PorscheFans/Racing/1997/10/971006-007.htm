Scott,

I too went through a similar process with my 82 Euro Targa.  First I
lowered it and went up to 21 and 28 mm torsion bars.  I then added a
full cage so I upgraded to 23 and 29 mm torsion bars and added
adjustable Charlie bars and solid bushings.  Now the car handles
awesome!

I was always told to not go real stiff in a Targa without a cage but I
thought the car handled great when I went to 21's and 28's.  You could
definitely feel the chassis flex with the 21/28 combination, especially
at tracks such as Bridgehampton.

If I was doing it without a cage I would consider: 21's 28's and
adjustable sway bars, front and rear.  Lower the car and add some sticky
tires and  you're off!  I'd leave the bushings alone unless you decide
to put in a cage.

Safety Editorial: If you decide to get serious about driver's ed, and
you find yourself pushing your car, I would strongly consider a full
roll cage.  I've seen numerous incidents at both races and drivers ed
where the driver was lucky to get out alive.  I've seen drivers get
launched into the passenger side A pillar. I've seen the top of the
windshield frame (on a Targa) collapse and crush the front of the
drivers helmet (and you should've seen the bruise on his forehead).
I've seen rollbars mounted to the floor push four inches through the
floor (think about this one).  I've seen many many cars in drivers ed
end up on their roof.  It does happen, alot.  If anybody says otherwise
they're wrong!  At the very least, you should invest in a pair (don't
forget your instructor!) of good racing seats.  Recaro SRD's are a good
street / track compromise.  Forget the harness over a harness bar with
stock seats! ... Soapbox dismount...

Subject: Racing a Targa?

I have a '78 Targa and was considering some suspension mods for the
track
like 22mm adjustable front and rear sway bars and 22mm front and 28mm
rear
torsion bars.  The car is a daily driver also.  So I'm not sure if the
Targa is worth the mods, particularly:

1. Does the weight addition and stiffness reduction of a Targa (without
roll cage) make it a poor choice for a driver's ed. car?

2.  Given that I don't want to add a roll cage, are there suspension
modifications which make *more* or *less* sense on the Targa due to the
inherent reduced stiffness of the body?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
