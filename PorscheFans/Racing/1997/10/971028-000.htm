The yellow Rohr GT1 was in fact at the back of Rohr's pits--and it had been
damaged, although I don't know if the damage occurred Thursday or at a
previous event. Saturday I witnessed a Rohr team member doing bodywork on
the car (he was equipped with an extra-large can of Bondo), and by Sunday
morning the car had fresh yellow paint. Later Sunday morning I saw several
Rohr team members assembling the front of the car.

A damaged GT1 nosepiece (not the body, but the internal structure with
ducting for the brakes, etc.) was laying next to the car.
