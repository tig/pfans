I'll jump into the fracas by stating my understanding of the function of the
(anti) sub belt.

My understanding is that the 5th and 6th points were developed for forms of
racing other than PCA, SCCA or NASCAR.  It was originally developed for
TransAm and Formula racing where the driver's position is extremely "laid
back".  Original intent was to keep driver from sliding out from under lap
and shoulder harnesses.

It also seems that the additional benefit that was discovered is that, for
those who drive in a more upright position, it keeps the lap belt from riding
up (or being forced up in a collision) and causing compression on the soft,
vulnerable abdominal cavity.  If the sub belt will keep the lap belt around
the hip bones or pelvic structure, there's much less chance of internal
injuries.

This summarizes conversations / discussions I've had with other drivers (many
from this list), and while I don't claim any expertise along these (or many
other) lines, it certainly seemed to make good sense.

Flame away, if you must,

Jeff Fortenbery
