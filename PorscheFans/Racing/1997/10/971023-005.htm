Hi,

Roll bar padding.

I don't know what quality the roll bar padding is that
is discussed on the list, but we use a SFI spec. padding =

in our dragster.
This is available at least from Taylor Motorsports Products.
It meet and exceed SFI Spec. 45.1. There is two types,
180 degree and I believe round also. This stuff is very
"dense", not like some of the stuff that is called
roll bar padding. This is expensive, don't know if it is
because of SFI? Just wanted You to know.

	Item #550   36" piece SFI 45.1 35.- USD

Anti sub strap

I have followed the discussion here about the anti sub strap.
As I'm getting older, I get more careful and got a harness bar
and 5-point harness. I still have the stock seat, and have been
satisfied with the use of 5-point harness without the sub strap.
I mounted the harness to stock locations. Lap belts to side of
seat and shoulder belts to rear seat belt anchor points. I feel =

that the lap belts come down in such angle that if I tight them =

first and then the shoulder belts it is better than the stock belt.

Am I fooling myself?  =
