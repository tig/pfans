This weekend I ran in a driver's ed event at Putnam Park and experienced
what may be a problem and wanted to get some advice from the list.  I was
running in the A group with an '84 911 and have run at Putnam Park on 9
separate weekends not to mention various other driver ed groups at Mid
Ohio, Elkhart Lake and Gingerman in the same car.  Three weekends ago I was
an instructor at a Putnam driver ed event and posted consistent lap times
in the 1:28's and occasionally in the 1:27's with my students riding along.
I started this weekend by running in the low 1:27's but the times became
progressively slower throughout the weekend until the final session on
Sunday when I was consistently (several laps within 0.1 sec) running 1:30
flat.  The weather was  good throughout the weekend, the tires (R1s) were
in good shape throughout the weekend and I did not detect any change in the
car's handling.  I did put new pads on Sunday morning but the braking
seemed to be very similar.
        I am wondering if I am starting to see a drop in the engine power
(although I did not notice any obvious signs such as misfire or
hesitation).  Any advice as where to start looking and how to diagnose a
potential engine problem?
        Of course maybe I could start by looking in the mirror because it
could be the driver.  However my lap times were very consistent, I didn't
make any changes to my line and have never experienced such a significant
change in lap times before.
