Guys,

Craig Seko wrote asking about roll cages in PCA Club Racing and that brings
to mind a couple of points:

(1)  I would not drive from the paddock to the hot pits, let alone out on the
track, without a roll cage in my race car.  

(2)  I would suggest that you refer to page 6, number 4, in the Rule Book
where it states that "it is strongly recommended that all cars . . . be
fitted with a roll cage."

(3)  A roll cage that is bolted in so that it can "slide around" will not
pass tech and Craig's right that it would be ridiculous.  I am not a
scrutineer, but somewhere in the rules it says that even a roll bar must be
securely in place with metal to metal contact.

(4)  And this is the real reason I am responding:  We have established a
Safety Committee and the members are myself, Bob Barker, Tom Charlesworth and
Harry Hall.  We are going to be looking at all aspects of safety in PCA Club
Racing and one of the things we will be looking at is the requirement to have
roll cages in ALL cars as mandatory.  After the first of the year, all
licensed racers will receive a questionnaire about safety that will include
what equipment you have and your impressions about possible changes.  I urge
all of you to return same as soon as possible and, in the mean time, if you
have observations about safety, I would like to hear them.

(5)  At the same time, you do not have to wait for somebody else to tell you
that you must/should have a roll cage.  I have had my share of shunts in race
cars and, like Craig, I would not be comfortable on the track without one.
 Our program is built upon the premise of individual responsibility; i.e., a
rule book that states, "It is the driver's responsibility . . .".  That is
not going to change.  If You feel that You would be safer with a full roll
cage, do it.  AutoPower is developing a bolt in kit that will convert your AP
roll bar into a roll cage and it is even possible to use side bars that can
be removed when not racing.     

(6)  Further, I will be meeting with the PCA Club Racing National Advisory
Board on November 7/8.  At that meeting we will be discussing the program in
general, where we are, where we want to be and how we're going to get there.
 If you (PCA Club Racers only, please) have thoughts that are important to
you and that you think we should be concerned with, please let me know.

We live in exciting times and are members of a dynamic, evolving program.  We
are interested in your input.

Monte
