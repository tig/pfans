Hello out there,

I have a simple question about suspension upgrades for an
89 951 (S) that I race in E stock.

I want to improve my stock suspension. Of course, money is 
very big issue, as I must leave myself with funds for tires,
entry fees, gas, etc.

My car currently has the stock 951S suspension. I would like
to make some simple improvements. Basically, I would like to
stiffen the car so it doesn't roll as much. 

For the rear, I'm thinking Weltmeister 22mm adjustable rear sway bar.
I helped a friend install one of those on his 86 951, it was easy to
do, and worked well.

I have some options for the front, and I'm not sure which is the best
approach. I can change springs, swaybars or both. Why would I change
one vs. the other? I'm thinking that I'm happy with the way the car is
sprung, ie it doesn't dive excessively under braking, it just leans too
much. So that means (to me) that I should increase the front sway bar.
My front swaybar is currently a tubular 26.8mm, so it doesn't look like
going to a 28mm will do very much. So should I get a 30mm front bar?
How about changing the front springs to 400 lb 'cup car' spring, 
and leaving the swaybar alone? 

The shocks are Koni adjustables, and I don't plan on changing them.

Anything else? What about suspension bushings? Do the 'camberball'
type devices do anything? 

Any advice welcome.

Thanks,
