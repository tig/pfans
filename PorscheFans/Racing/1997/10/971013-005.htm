	I am trying to get insurance on my toy car that I built while work at a
Porsche repair place and go to collage. I am 24 years old and have a 1970
911 with the 1984  3.2 engine, 915 trans. and Carrera suspension and
brakes. The car has SC Flares, some fiberglass parts, no interior and a
full roll cage.
	State Farm has covered me on my 944 and now a Ford Ranger. But with the
911 they have a list of problems it is not stock vehicle, the full roll
cage, no interior and the big one going to PCA events. State Farm said that
they might work with if I did not go to thing like PCA event for the first
year or so.  
	I am trying to stay with State Farm because my parents have been with them
for 30 years.   
	I know that insurance does not cover you on the track, all I want is
insurance to drive to the track.
	Any suggestion?
	Has any one tried Leland West Insurance Brokers, Inc.?   This is the one
with the ad in Panorama.
	I have two or three weeks before I am ready for the road and have to find
insurance.
