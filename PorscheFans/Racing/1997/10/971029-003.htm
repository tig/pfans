Well, having not had the oportuninty to play with a 993 yet, I can't say
anything about the suspension in particular. Anyone want to let me learn
on their car? :) :)

Anyway, in your circumstance, you're not going to be able to gain any
rearward weight transfer by gassing it more. If the tires are already
lit up, they will not be able to accelerate you. Lifting in this
situation, on the other hand, will have a profound effect and you will
most likely wind up looking at the rest of the pack coming at your
through your front windscreen. The best solution to your partuclar
situation, is to not get on the gas quite so early. However, if the
tires have not strated spinning yet, and the rear end is drifting, then
yes more gas _might_ well fix the problems. But if your tires are
already spinning, there's not an easy fix. Not all errors are easilly
recoverable. 

Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong...
