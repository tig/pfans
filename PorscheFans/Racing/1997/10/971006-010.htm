Depends on how much you want to compromise ride vs. handling if
your car is a daily driver.  I went with 21/27 t-bars and 22 f/r swaybars
and most importantly sticky tires and the handling was transformed
without a severe degradation in ride quality.  Stay away from plastic bushings
if you want to keep the fillings in your teeth and avoid the squeaks.  
If you're
going to do this stuff, remember the rack spacers to correct bump steer if you
lower the car and a good 4-wheel alignment (corner-balanced recommended).

I know of a '73 and '84 targa with 22/28 t-bars and they love it but I 
was told by
a reputed racer/mechanic that the extra stress will loosed the welds in a Targa
eventually unless you put in a full cage to stiffen it.  There must be 
some truth
to this as I suffered the common swaybar mount fracture after going to R1s.

Not at all, I'm having a ball doing track and autox with my ol' Targa.

I'd do tires first, then t-bars and swaybars together.  I did swaybars 
first and
couldn't tell the difference.  BTW, I agree with Mark re: safety first. 
 Good brake
pads/fluid first. Good seats and harnesses keep you planted.  I went with OMP
San Remo seats because they recline for access to the rear but have the 
harness
slots and are as deeply bolstered as race seats but a lot more 
comfortable for daily
driving.  I also started out  saying I didn't want to put a cage in but 
the faster
I go, the more I think it's nice to have some insurance in case 
something happens.

Hope this helps,
