No, unless these drivers ed events are hours long. Your tires should
last a good bit longer. However, race tires have an expensive learning
curve. If you've never driven on race tires before (I don't know, maybe
you have), there will be a learning curve ascociated with the tire. Race
tires can perform amazingly better than street tires, but are not as
forgiving when you over-drive them.

Where it wears depends on alot of things. Outer shoulder wear is not
overly common on R1s, due mostly to the "pseudo-camber" effect of the
sidewall construction. Non-EGOD (Evil Groove Of Doom) wear usually is
indicative of suspension. If you have a fairly stiff front spring rate
and a fair amount of negative camber, you will observe wear in the
manner you describe.  This is either a result of long term stright ahead
driving on negatively cambered wheels, or (in my case) braking and
occasional small lock-ups. I'm assuming your cord is showing a fairly
even pattern and not the result of flat spotting. Because the front
tires are cambered, there is less of a straight ahead contact patch, and
that contact patch will be on the inner edge of the tire. Hence, heavy
braking puts more load on a smaller amount of tire, wearing it out
quicker. And any brake lock-ups will help hasten the demise of the tire
in exactly that region.
 
BTW, EGOD is generally the result of underinflation and occurs at the
second treadblock in from the outter edge of the tire. It is quite
possible to have a drastically underinflated tire and not be noticable
to the eye. The sidewalls are very stiff and will be able to support a
cars weight with very low pressures, but the carcass of the tire will
flex too much and the hinge point of that flexing is right at that
second tread block. The flexing will heat the rubber up very quickly and
essentially boil the rubber right off the tire.

Seeing as how you do alot of drivers ed events, did you have the tires
shaved before you ran them at the track? This will really help prolong
the life of your tires if you regularly run track events. An unshaved
tire at track speeds will see alot of tread squirm. The taller tread
blocks allow the tread to shift around under the weight of the car. This
squirm is friction, and friction is heat. This is a common cause of
shortened lifetimes for R1s that see frequent track use or autox on very
heavy (big V8s) cars.

Hope this helps. Have fun! And remeber to heat cycle your R1s before you
race on 'em.
