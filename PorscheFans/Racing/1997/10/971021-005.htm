As an SCCA Scrutineer, I can tell you why sitting on the "crotch/sub"
belt is NOT safe.  The purpose of the sub strap is not to hold you
from sliding forward under the lap belts.  It is supposed to keep the
lap belts from riding up the body when the shoulder straps are pulled
tight.  Ideally you want the belt to come up through the seat.  Since
we don't all have racing seats, and we don't want to cut up our
everyday seats, a compromise has to be made.  

We agree so far.  However, we differ a bunch on some physics.  If 
you pull tight on a belt that comes over the front of the seat, you are
pulling the lapbelt AWAY from the body and forcing it to be more 
horizontal, which creates an edge that will slice into your gut on
a frontal impact.  6-point belts run under the thighs and back to the
lapbelt mounting point will, when pulled tight, keep the vertical aspect
of the lapbelt and keep it from riding up.  This is not about the
bolthole in the front.  This is about doing it right.  I agree with
your polemics about how important safety is.  That's why I don't
think a substrap over the front of the seat is any good at all.
