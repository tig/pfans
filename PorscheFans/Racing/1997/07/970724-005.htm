I've looked into harnesses just lately.
I found that MOMO was for me.  TRW is widely used by very capable and
knowledgeable drivers and was my second choice.

You will need to decide on having a brace or fitting a rollbar.

I don't think most drivers run the submarine (crotch) strap, so you're
looking at a four point harness.  But this is not so much an opinion as
just an observation.

Also, I've been advised that shoulder pads are worth the extra pennies for
the comfort.

Cheers
