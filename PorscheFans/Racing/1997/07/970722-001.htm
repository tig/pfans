Hi Steve,

> '74 914-2.0 for PCA Club Racing.   I need to budget  initial car prep 
> with myself

Hey, this sounds familiar. I'm going through the same thing, only for
a 944. I didn't want to wait while I built a car, so I raced my 89
951 at Lime Rock, and I'll be racing again at Pocono in August.
It was a blast!

> doing all the labor.   This will be a stock or improved class car which will

If possible, stay in the stock class. This way, you're not racing
someone's wallet. Well, you still are, but it isn't as bad.

> not be competitive but I don't care once I'm actually racing and having fun.

That's my attitude. Unless you can afford a new set of Hoosiers or
GSCS for every race, and have the car prepared to the absolute limit,
you aren't going to win. You'll still have a lot of fun racing the
people who are the same speed. 

> battery cut-off	
    $40, plus $$ to install, or $5 for you to do it (assuming you
can figure out the wiring). I took a look at that, and paid my 
mechanic to do it. I was afraid of frying the computer. Make sure
you get the double pole switch, for cars with alternators. 

> window net	?
    $20, plus $25 for mounting kit.

> brake pads	$200
    make sure you use real race pads. I'm very happy with Performance
Friction PF 80 compound.

> R1s		$500 - have 205/60R15 but 205/50 still stock?
   The rule book states in section 3. Tire and Wheels, paragraph F.
"195/50-15 and 205/50-15 tires may not be used on any stock car,
and 225/50-15 tires may be used only on 75-77 930 and 75-82 924."
I have no idea why.

> Harnesses	already have - can long 911 harness be dual-use
> 		for both cars?  i.e. some way of attaching to cage?
   Yes. The roll bar must have a horizontal bar. You can attach the
shoulder harnesses to that bar with wrap around ends.

> Are the prices realistic assuming sourcing some used stuff?

Except for the 914 suspension stuff, which I have no idea of,
your prices seem OK. 

> So what else did I forget?  Any interest in forming a race team in

Driving gear. You need an SFI suit, nomex underwear (or a two layer
suit), gloves, SA 90 helmet, etc. You need steel lug nuts ($40 at
Automotion).  You need to get a catalog from Racer Wholesale. Call them
at 800-886-RACE, or http://www.racerwholesale.com. They're the best!

How are you going to get to the track? I drove my car to Lime Rock, and
I'll be driving to Pocono. I can fit a lot of stuff in it.  However,
I'm not comfortable doing that, so I'm thinking about what to get to
tow with. I keep moving from an old cargo van, to a motorhome, to a
pick up, and back again.

The last thing you need is a crew. While you can probably do without,
having at least 1 person there makes it a lot easier. I had a friend
meet me at the track. He timed laps, took tire temps and pressures,
helped me figure out how to adjust the car, gave advice and support,
and made the weekend go a lot easier. 

> the North-East to share driving/expenses?  Am I nuts - my family

Yeah, you're nuts. We all are.

If you lived a little closer to me (or me to you) we could do that.
However, we're too far apart. 

> PCA Club race rules - so far I'm still day-dreaming but I'd like to buy
> a car now, prep over the winter for the '98 season.

Good plan.
