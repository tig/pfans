Hi 914-Pfans,

I've done my share of Driver's Ed and am considering the purchase of a
'74 914-2.0 for PCA Club Racing.   I need to budget  initial car prep 
with myself
doing all the labor.   This will be a stock or improved class car which will
not be competitive but I don't care once I'm actually racing and having fun.

So far I've thought of the following other than $3k purchase price,
assuming a relatively rust-free car w/o engine work needed:

bolt-in cage	$500?  used?
battery cut-off	?
window net	?
brake pads	$200
R1s		$500 - have 205/60R15 but 205/50 still stock?
Springs		$100
T-bars		$100
Shocks		$200
Harnesses	already have - can long 911 harness be dual-use
		for both cars?  i.e. some way of attaching to cage?
Extinguisher	have
OMP race seat	already have

Are the prices realistic assuming sourcing some used stuff?
So what else did I forget?  Any interest in forming a race team in
the North-East to share driving/expenses?  Am I nuts - my family
thinks so!   Yes, I know I have to contact Ruth Harte to get the official
PCA Club race rules - so far I'm still day-dreaming but I'd like to buy
a car now, prep over the winter for the '98 season.

Thanks for any input,

Steve Jagernauth   jagernauth_stephen@bns.att.com
'74 911/3.0 and maybe '74 914-2.0 soon
