Basically, this is correct. The moisture in compressed air is _not_
gasseous. It is in fact water suspended in air. When depressurised (from
100+ psi) and heated it becomes gas and expands significantly in volume.

Yup, but is more predictable (no humidity factor) and will expand less
as well.

Really? I would expect, if anything, a small nitrogen bottle for tires
and just a big 'ol compressor or tank of compressed air. Dry nitrogen is
a good bit more expensive than just plain old compressed air. As for
what kindof difference it makes? I dunno, it depends on how into the
toys of the trade you are. I suppose it might make things just a wee bit
better to predict, but can't see it make that much of a difference
unless you do it _all_ the time (read professional) and are battling
over tenths of a second. But what do I know? I'm just an amateur...

Got the beat up 'ol pickup with duct tape towing the pristene and
gleaming race car too? :)
