Barry,

There is a group called Customer Driven Cars that works out of the 
NY-NJ-Conn. area that rents 944's for races. I am sure they can help you in 
the $'s of the deals.

It is not unusual in racing for rentals to be run, even in Nascar you can 
rent a ride.

I thought of building a set of J & K stock racers out of 914's, the 
exposure would be light and the chance of supper high speed crash repair 
should be lighter than with 944 & 951 cars.

Barry, I'm no expert, for sure, but I attended the entire Parade Club Race
at TWS. I saw *alot* of practicing. I mean, a *lot*. I think you'd wear
the tires, brakes, suspension, engine, etc. out faster than you're
figuring, i.e. you should up your rental costs to cover it. Also, I've
seen a lot of spins and car to car contact. I know you can get insurance
for that sort of thing but it's bound to be expensive. I think you might
also attract some "risky" drivers. You know, people that don't want to
take risks with their car, but would be happy to take risks with someone
elses? Some food for thought...
