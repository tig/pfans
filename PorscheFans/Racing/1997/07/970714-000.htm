Hello!

   I'm trying to get the DME injection on a '91 C2 engine to fit in my 914. 
After removing all the non-essentials, it's very close. However, the trunk is
in the way of the intake. Surprise, surprise.
   My question. I definitely could not fit the factory air box and air cleaner,
so it has been removed and replaced with the smaller MSDS intake unit. However,
this is still in the way, because it mounts parallel with the trunk, right on
top of it. If I add an 4" long plastic tube (3" diameter; same as intake) bent
at 45 degrees so that it turns away from the trunk it will fit. How would adding
such a tube effect the engines performance? I could speculate, but does anybody
really know? Help me save as much of my trunk as possible!
  
Thanks in advance,
Steve
