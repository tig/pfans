Here's hoping this gets sent only once, and some of you actually read it!
Just got back from my first driver's ed event at Road Atlanta and WOW, what
fun!  And this is from someone working pit lane, not driving.  Next time, I
promise!  I gotta say that it was really well run, with only minor mishaps
and two broken cars.  A 951 got it sideways coming out of turn 11 and ended
up on pit road with the right rear wheel at an unnatural angle, and a
pretty radical 930 lost it somewhere in the esses and did some serious
gardening -- broken bumper and lots 'o weeds where there shouldn't be any,
but still rolling.  The owner was standing next to me when it came in and
his reaction?  "Oh well.  I needed a new bumper anyway."  It was labled
"Team Cheap" if anyone knows them.  Oh yeah, one guy in a 944 blew his
engine, but not a racing incident.  Contrast this with a BMW club event
there not too long before.  Five serious accidents, three totalled M3s, and
plenty of minor incidents.

Highlights:  Picture a 904 in a spectacular spin coming down the hill out
of turn 11 (same place the 951 lost it), catching it, powering through the
final turn, and accelerating down the front straight.  Same 904 losing it
in turn 1 earlier in the day, lots of dust and gravel, and really stuck.
No harm done and he didn't spin once on Sunday!  Great to see cars like
this being *driven*, not stuck in a museum somewhere.  A guy ran his
Mercedes 500E in group 4 and really held his own.  I had no idea those cars
were that fast and had that much brakes.  I also got to do a "fun run"
around the track on Sunday and loved it.  If only the guy in the Jetta had
known what a racing line was, I might not have been on his bumper so
much... :)

I was working pit road where the cars were coming off of the track --
directing traffic mostly.  The drivers were all very friendly, waving and
having a great time (jealous!), especially the guys in the final run group
with the "BEER!" sign. :)  Here's hoping they waited until *after* they
came in!  One guy in a highly modified 914 came flying into the pits,
around the corner and into the paddock, through our signals to slow down
and scaring the hell out of me and my partner.  He came down later
apologizing profusely, saying he was stuck in 4th gear and couldn't slow
down that much.  Nice guy and no harm done, thank God.

All in all, great fun and a wonderful weekend.  I met so many new friends I
couldn't begin to count and can't wait to get more active in the club.  If
you haven't been, or don't think you can drive in it, just go.  Volunteer
to work, anything.  Believe me, you'll love it!
