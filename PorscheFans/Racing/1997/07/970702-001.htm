I hope that this post isn't too far below the level of the group.

Background:

I currently do not own a Porsche yet. I hope to be acquiring my first in the 
next 12 months. This car will be a daily driver, but I also intend to begin 
exploring the sport of racing with this car. SCCA Solo II racing has been 
recommended to me as a good place to start but I hope to grow into track 
events. My current place of residence is Northwest Ohio and I hope to stay in 
the area.

Question 1:

What is a good car to start with? Costs, both acquisition and maintenance will 
be important as my accountant/wife will be scrutinizing this endeavor.

Question 2:

Where can I go in this part of the country to see some good Porsche action in 
a track setting? 

Please feel free to respond directly if this post is too far below the level 
of the group.

Thanks
