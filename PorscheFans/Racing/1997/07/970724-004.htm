Less likely to submarine with 6pt, less holes in car, can attach
to same pts as lap belt (someone else pls confirm)

>2)  Expensive (Simpson, Bell) or cut-rate (AutoPro, TRW)?
TRW Sabelts are used by a lot of racing teams and < $200.  I saw
a picture with them in the 911 GT1 so they are not inferior in any way.

>3)  Mounting systems - removeable, full-time, use w/ standard belts, etc.?
For s street driven car, you want snap-in ends to undo easily.

>4)  Rating - I don't want to buy something and learn it's no good for SCCA,
>PCA, etc.
They must be SFI certified meeting SFI 16.1 spec.  There is a date
on the label.  SCCA requires belt to be changed every 2-3 years,
not sure on exact interval.

>5)  Pull-up or pull down?  Sternum strap, H-strap?

I had pull-downs on my former '87 951 which I transferred to my
current car.  I think I would prefer pull-ups for the lap-belts.  You need
the H-style on the shoulder belts to prevent separation esp. with stock
seats.  Non-issue with race seats with harness cut-outs.

On the 951, you'll need to drill at least 2 holes per side if you
go with 5-pts - 1 for the sub and the other for the inboard lap belt.

Hope this helps,
