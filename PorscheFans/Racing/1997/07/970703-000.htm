IMSG TO FORM NEW STOCKCAR ROAD RACING SERIES

2 July, 1997
TAMPA, Fla. (July 2, 1997) -- International Motor Sports Group (IMSG) today
announced
the formation of the United States Road Racing StockCar Championship which
will provide a
highly-visible arena for SportsCar competitors who prefer
tube-frame (StockCar) type construction over the unibody (GT) style that has
recently become
so popular. "This is the next step in a five-year plan to restructure
professional road racing in
North America," said Andrew Evans, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of
IMSG.
"All of our market research indicates that a large majority of motorsport
fans prefer evenly
matched, single class racing," said Kurtis Eide, President of IMSG
Properties. Additionally,
television sports networks prefer a two-hour format including pace lap, green
flag, checkered
flag and winner's interview for both live and live-to-tape programming.
IMSG will add a StockCar Commission to its recently-formed GT and SportsCar
Commissions in North America. The Commission will oversee the technical and
sporting
regulations for the new group of road racing StockCars. "The first two
members to be named
to this group are Dave Watson, who will also serve as the Brand Manager for
the new series,
and Mike Lozano of Lozano Brothers Racing Engines," said Doug Robinson, Vice
President
of Race Operations.
The new United States Road Racing StockCar Championship will have 10-12 races
in 1998, with $2,000,000 in appearance plan money and a per race purse of
more than
$50,000. Teams which have previously competed in series like GTS-1, Trans-Am,
ARCA
and ASA should find this series to be very attractive.
The concept of running this type race in combination with World SportsCar and
GT SportsCar
race weekends has been successful with record crowds at Lime Rock Park for
the past two
years. Mosport Park and Pikes Peak International Raceway will host combined
events this
season. Many other promoters have expressed interest for 1998.
New regulations will emphasize three-year rules stability leading to
specifications that will
enable new race cars to be constructed for under $100,000, with engines under
$30,000.
Annual racing budgets for front running cars should be less than $500,000.
