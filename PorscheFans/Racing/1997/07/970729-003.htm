<<i am looking at a porsche which was originally owned by Don
Wittington, i am
not familiar with this name, my ignorance, could anyone give me
background on
his racing history,>>

Don Whittington is one of the (in)famous Whittington brothers who got
into road racing very heavily during the 70s. Together they bought Road
Atlanta. They all 3 qualified at Indy one year (a record that will
probably never be beat!). They were found by the authorities to have
sold prodigious amounts of marijuana. I haven't heard a word about them
since.
