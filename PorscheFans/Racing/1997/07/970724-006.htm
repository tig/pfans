JeffBCS asked some good questions about seatbelts, and Steve
Jagernauth and others gave some good answers.  Have about a half
cent to add to that:

SCCA (in 95, don't think they have changed) requires that belts have an
SFI 16.1 label not more than 5  years old, with three years recommended.
While the hardware does not wear out, nylon webbing loses strength
over time,  UV being the major culprit I believe.  Our own club racing is
thinking about some such rule.  I hope they never do this, because I just
don't believe the strength loss over time in our usual applications is
significant, at least not with three inch web which hasn't been
mechanically (or chemically - you ought to see what battery acid does to
it) damaged.  Has anyone ever seen or heard of an accident where a
seat belt web component broke due to age induced weakness?  How
many drivers of street cars replace their 20 or 30 year old seat belts
(other than because of fraying or some other problem).  I mention this not
just to spread my prejudices concerning acceptable safety, but to point
out that Simpson will reweb, with a new SFI label, Simpson belts.  Don't
know just what they charge, but its got to be a whole lot less than
buying a new set every 5 years if the safety nannys have their way. 
Haven't seen anyone else advertise this, or that they are an SFI certified
belt rewebber, and Simpson is not going to reweb anyone else's belt. 

While latch style belts do the job fine and I haven't been moved to change
out the one in one of my cars, if you can come up with the extra cash
the camlock style is a lot more convenient since you can plug things in in
any order you want, or do the lower three in your pit, and attach the
shoulders in the grid after you put your helmet on, etc.  Fact is, driver's
often tend to be strapping in a bit late in the game, and the cam style is
less of a hassle, leaving the mind freer to prepare for the challenge
ahead.  

I like the TRW (and its price), but found that I could  catch the protruding
tab you grip to release with the gauntlet of my driving glove while turning
a corner.  Once was enough for that (just driver's ed, fortunately, so I
came in), so I sawed the part off and bolted on something which couldn't
be caught.  Never heard anyone else complain of this happening, though.
 Same thing happened to me once in an autocross with my latch type
belt.  Bell design camlock can't catch, and Simpson looks like it wouldn't
since you pull forward to release, and it nestles down pretty much out of
the way of flying wrists.

SCCA only requires a 6 point if seated in a semi-reclining position (as in a
Formula Ford, etc, not any of our production based cars), otherwise 5 is
fine for upright seating.  IMSA's rules used to be on their website before
they changed their name, and required a 6 point for all cars.  However, a
friend who got his Porsche passed by IMSA with a 5 point hadn't heard
of this and was given no hassle.  I can't see why a 6 point would have
the slightest safety advantage (if you hit so hard you would break a
single web sub strap but not a double, would you want to live?).  But
installing without drilling holes is very much a plus.  I put my 5 point in,
then bought a seat with a sub hole in it, and had to move my mounting, so
I now have 2 holes.  If I ever get a different car I would use a 6 if it
would save drilling.

However, why settle for a 4 point.  I started that way with the latch
system, but soon added the sub.  The hip belt part was a belly belt
without the sub strap to keep it down.
