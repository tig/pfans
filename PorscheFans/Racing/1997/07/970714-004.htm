I was at this race , their first and Jerry Door and his region did a first
rate job. About 90 cars showed up and about 60 raced, The course is very
technical...some tough turns, but there are vast runoffs almost everywhere.
This is good if you get in trouble, but there are no landmarks for
reference. And there is precious little shade! 
Lovely resort area...I would recommend it to you for next year.. Its a lot
like PutnamThere were no serious incidents, by the way., which is nice for a
first race, and there were some very hot cars there.
