Joshua:

In a perfect world, all air compressors would have working dryers. 
In OUR world, however (and especially at our racetracks and gas
stations), most air compressors arerarely blown down and the dryers,
if installed, are never maintained properly.

The easiest moderately-priced solution is to buy an air tank, fill
it with dry air from your own presumably-well-maintained compressor,
and carry it with you to the track.
