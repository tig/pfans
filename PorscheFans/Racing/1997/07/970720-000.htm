<pardon me for posting to the racing list - want to make sure D.
Bergstrom sees this>

Thank you PCA- Loma Prieta Region  and D. Bergstrom (my unflappable
instructor) for the INCREDIBLE time at the 3Com Park Autocross
today!!!   I not only have come away from the event with tremendous
respect for AX driver abilities, but also the fearless, volunteer corner
workers whom I am glad I did not mow down any today... (I learned to
stand away from apexes too!)

Ok 928 fans - here's how the day went:

I obviously was the new guy as I circled Candlestick trying to find out
how to get in the dang parking lot and once in, how to get to the PCA
area avoiding the SCCA AX class which was running at the same time.

Once parked, it was off to the registration table where I met Tom
Provasi who was very helpful explaining the event.  I also met 928 AX'r
Bob Kusche (hope I'm spelling all this right) and his wife (thanks again
for the apple & pop, I was starving!).  Bob's running the Devek
coilovers and AX tires and looks cool in the car with his helmet on.
The track announcer comments on the great sound the 928 engine makes
under acceleration when Bob does his runs.  While I was walking around
the lot I met Dick Bergstrom, who volunteered to be my instructor (boy
he didn't know what he was getting into!).

There were plenty of cars for the afternoon runs, so many that I was
changed from the blue group to the red group.  That meant corner worker
duty first after we all walked the course.   Ok, grab a red flag and
hopefully find a safe spot out on the course to pick-up cones, etc.  You
know me, I headed over to the fastest part of the track, the long back
chicane (wow where did I learn that!?) and avoided standing anywhere I
saw tire marks leaving the course!

Never having been to an autocross before, I was then in for a treat as
LPR members came BLAZING by just scant feet away, exhausts roaring!
Yippee! I saw at least four 911's handling so hard their front tires
were lifting in the corners!!!  There were some spectacular spins, but
inside I was already getting nervous and knew that I'd probably top them
all by mistake somehow.  Each driver was given four runs, with each run
having an initial warm-up lap, then the official timed run - a good
amount of time behind the wheel.  I noted one 911 so smooth it appeared
that he wasn't going fast at all, when indeed he was one of the fastest
cars out on the track, running 37-38 seconds!  On one run, something
upset his near perfect balance and concentration and only then with the
car slightly out-of-control could a spectator see -Holy Cow- he is
really moving fast!

The last car of the group was lining up, and the red group workers were
called in to prepare their cars.  Jeez, I better hit the bathroom
first!  Thankfully, this was not a problem as there were plenty of
'portable facilities' available for us to use.

Back in the car, engine running to get it up to temp, my instructor Dick
began to explain what was in store.  I was lucky to have read the
'Secrets of Solo Racing' book from the AX school I missed earlier so I
could understand much of what he was talking about.  I'll not detail it
all here because you need this first-hand in the proper setting (in your
928 with an instructor!) plus I'd probably mis-quote him as there was
alot of information all at once.  The course would be run pretty much
exclusively in 2nd gear - whip out your manuals and see how fast that is
in your particular car near redline!

The pit lane worker gives us the signal so we don our helmets and pull
forward and watch the start/stop flagman.  We'll be entering the course
while another car is circulating also so I'm told do not take your eyes
off him, and when he points over, to extend my left arm to acknowledge
back.  There's the signal, wait, green flag - pull on course and NAIL
IT!

Down the short straight, pull off a shift to 2nd, brake for turn one,
right turn, heavy gas, uh-oh here's come the rear, I panic and lift,
arms flailing,  here we go SPECTACULAR SPIN #1 in less than a few
seconds into the practice!  Cool!  I'm facing the wrong way, forgot to
clutch it in case the motor backspins (didn't) and looking at my trick
skidmarks.  A few attempts with the starter and Get it back on course!
We complete the right sweeper and start speeding through the back
chicane and I start to get disoriented - do I go outside of these cones
or wha?  (the answer is between the 'gate').  Too hot through the
chicane I come up against the weird dog legs that should be little
straights but brake way late and turn too much again and whups,
SPECTACULAR SPIN #2 but this time heading straight for the fence!!!
Dick has enough time to yell " BRAKES!!! BRAKES!!! " before becoming
totally speechless.  In retrospect, we had come close but thanks to the
course layout there was still more open space to go, whew.

Hey, you can't say I'm not trying and I don't know why I'm trying to go
balls-out on my first run even during practice but nows the time to push
all my limits - not on the street right?  So, rev it up and  Back on
course and complete the run.  Again, another sweeper and another couple
of tight sections.  It just looks like a wall of cones directly in front
of me and I mow them all down.  I mean ALL of them.  Sorry corner
workers - I'm lost!  Coming round the timing lights, I make my timed
pass and get a 49 seconds with a few cones.  And almost the timing
position too as I forget to pickup my slip (sorry - I'll do better I
promise!).

Back in the staging area, we review my 'performance' and note that the
GT has a tremendous surplus of power & brakes, the better approach at
this point is to ease on the power or stoppers.  Also we start
discussing how to catch a spin, or save a tail-out attitude with power.
Braking points.  Markers.  Hand positioning.  Turns.   Dick is amp'd and
going a mile a minute.  I am amp'd and trying to digest all the info and
glad he's along for the ride.

On subsequent, more relaxed runs, I am starting to get it.  I start
'seeing' the course and where it goes, especially where once was a just
a wall of cones now becomes a clear left / right / left section.  It's
almost like a revelation, like getting eyesight for the first time.  I
can SEE the course!!!  Now it's getting fun...   My times drop to a 42
and a 43 , plus a couple of cones.  Hey - I'M AUTOCROSSING!!!

Did I have fun?  You bet!  Did I learn anything?  Tons!  Do I think you
should do this too?  Definately!  Is it expensive?  Try $20!

This is a great way to start learning about how to drive your 928, or
any car, before venturing out onto the track or roadcourse. Dick said,
if you think things happen fast here when you lose it (and they do),
imagine the same thing but at 150 - you've got to know what to do and
how your car is going to react.   Highly recommend the AX experience to
you, especially with the PCA, which as you see, doesn't even have to be
your own region.  It will make you a better street driver too.

Also note that I didn't mention any concerns about fooling around with
tire pressures, etc.  Believe me, at the beginning stages this stuff
isn't going to matter - your ability to learn and apply what you've
learned will affect your times more.  (Well, I am super curious so I did
paint my sidewalls with shoe polish marks just to see - I'll raise my
fronts 4psi and leave the rears alone next time but once I get going I
won't pay much attention to tire pressure after that).

Everyone's been a first timer sometime - so no embarassment ok?  Just do
it!  You'll have a great time...

Thanks again LPR - see you next time!
Phil Tong
