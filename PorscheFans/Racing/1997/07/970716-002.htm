Hello,

It's a little slow at work right now, so I'm engaging in a little
daydreaming / planning.

Does anyone know, or have an opinion on, what the current demand
is for club race class I 944 rentals is? I would like to develop
such a car, and if I could rent it out at some events, that would
be a good thing.

It seems to me that the per race costs for that car would be:
1. Tires - say BFG R1, ~$600 set 
   good for 5 races?
   $120 / race
2. Gas - 20 gallons of 93 octane should do it
     30 / race
3. Brake pads / rotors
   should last 1 year at 10 races / year?
   say $150 for pads and rotors
     15 / race
4. Oil Mobil1, change every other race, plus filter
     15 / race

So, roughly, it would cost you about $200 race to field the car.
If you rent the car for $750, you make $500 a race weekend, or
about $250 / day. Not a lot of money. However, if my race expenses
are $500, then I rent one race, drive 1 race, and I don't have
to spend much money at all. I'm not counting travel expenses here,
and I probably should. If I use a motorhome to tow with and stay
in, that's at least another $100 in gas / food / tolls, etc.
for a 400 mile round trip.

Can you rent a NA 944 for $750? When you add the entry fee, that
brings the driver's cost to $1000, plus travel, lodging, food, etc.
Are people willing to spend that much money? I see rentals advertized
in Pano, but that's all I see. 

I've read the articles in Excellence about the guy (Bob Johnson?) that
hauls the cars to the races, and works on them. He seemed to charge an
aweful lot of money for that.

Any comments (besides "get back to work" or "that's a stupid idea")
