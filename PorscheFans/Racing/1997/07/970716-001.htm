My Porsche is a 1975  911S
It used to lost of power while exit a turn at normal speed, say 30 mph
at normal temperature engine and ambient,  at about 3000 rpm.
with 1st gear  or 2nd gear.

Subject problem stop me to join any local auto-cross event or road 
racing driving school.  it is no kidding sudden lost of power while 
managing a turn at high speed.

I do appreciate any help / advice given.

My 911S  (1975) comes with stock alloy wheels and tyre when I bought 12 
months ago.  I want wider wheels and low profile tyre.
Please advise how max-wide wheels I can have without rubbing fenders.
and what rubbers should I have.


Is it a good idea to remove CIS mechanical fuel injection and replace it 
with WEBER carburators ?   Any gain in H/P ?


Whenever I make down-shift from 5 to 4.  it used to grind reverse gear 
even I down-shift with extra care.   
Is a locking plate I can replace new to stop reverse gear grinding.
or a gear-box overhaul is on its way.

Thank you for help and advice.
Best regards and happy driving a Porsche.
