Torque Master also has a webpage at http://www.torquemaster.com  !

I just received a set from them to try in my 928 GT and am very
anxious!  Understand this is a very specialized plug and may require
some engine mod's to take full advantage of their design ie. hi-rate
injectors, etc.   Also, be realistic about the amount of performance
gains expected from a 'simple' plug change - slightly analogous to
expecting a chipswap making your car into a nitro-burning funny car - it
won't...

However when tenths or even hundreths of a second count - anything you
can do to stack the house is fair game.  As you can tell, I'll be on a
near holy war with the clock soon.

Will post back how my tests go,
Phil
