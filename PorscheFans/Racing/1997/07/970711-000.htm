Apologies for being late chiming in on this.  It seems that Eric Sternberg
forwarded to us a post to the BMW list from Charles Quarton which was
answering gofast@ix.netcom.com

I agree entirely with the position that limiting cars at the track, even for
first-timers, is pretty futile.  People think of low-rpm rev limiters and the
like, but the performance of the car also includes brakes and suspension.
While it is certainly nice to be going slower if real trouble develops, the
main effect of limiting power/revs (outside of going somewhat slower into
the normally heavy braking at the end of major straights) is that people
drive through the corners in the wrong gears.  I've watched this done at
the professional schools, and it's clearly counter-productive.

The main responsibility lies in the event administration and instructor 
corps to be sure that students get a clear idea of their limits and the
consequences at the track at hand.  Anyone not having the skill and 
judgement to voluntarily back off to a reasonable level of terror without 
defeating basic car capabilities is likely to be a menace to themselves 
and others and should go home.  Beyond that, I've really got no strong
feelings about the issue.
