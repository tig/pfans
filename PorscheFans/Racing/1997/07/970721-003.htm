Ahhh!  Normalcy.  The only Porschefans digest that appears to have =
avoided the repeating GPR flame.  I'm leaving the other digests until =
things clear up.

Phil, glad to see you had such a good time autocrossing.  I did my first =
couple of autocrosses last year, and I can definitely relate to your =
experiences.  I too was impressed by how "slow" the smooth cars appeared =
to be going, yet they were actually the fastest.  It's a great way to =
appreciate the smoothness adage.

It's even better when it happens to you.  I remember when I finally =
learned the course, I had a run that I was sure was one of my slowest, =
yet it turned out to be my quickest.  I was still fairly slow compared =
to the other cars in my class, yet I felt a lot of satisfaction that I =
seemed to be on my way to learning how to control my car.

Keep having fun!
