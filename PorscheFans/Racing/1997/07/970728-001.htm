Rob Channell wonders what the deal is with using nitrogen in tires.  He
gives Boyle's law (or is it Charles'?) and reasons that the increase in
pressure due to an increase in  heat in the same volume should be the
same no matter what the gas might be.  I guess I had always understood
the physics to be thus also.

Air in air tanks from compressors typically has moisture in it, sometimes
quite a lot. Higher pressure = higher boiling point = humidity changes back
to liquid?   What I have heard is that it is the moisture in the air which
causes it not to follow Boyles law (that's not the way you hear it
expressed at race tracks).  Analyzing the pressure behavior of such a
mixed gas exceeds my knowledge, alas, though the theory sounds good.

 Nitrogen is "dry," no doubt because of the care used in its manufacture. 
As such it shouldn't suffer from this complication.  Its pressure still
should increase with temperature.

Folks who haul one of those huge commercial tanks along to run air tools
have nitrogen in them (is it the least expensive?), and so use it for tires. 
Does anyone think it really makes a difference for our 20 minute races?

but has pressure bleedoffs on all his track rims)
