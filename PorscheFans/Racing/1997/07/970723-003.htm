Attn:  James McCullers

Hi, Jim.  I would be glad to give you my experience with
930 brakes & tire pressures.

My car is a '86 Turbo which I've owned since 1989.
The car is now seriously modified into a driver's ed
and club racing machine.  My work was done by
Bob Holcombe @ Motorsport Design in Scottsdale,AZ.

1)I too have front 928S4 calipers and mounted the stock
front 930 calipers to the rear.  I have retained the stock
master cylinder and have been satisfied with the setup
for 6 years.  I believe you can make the stock setup work
without necessitating dual master cylinders.
Certainly, your suspension will affect your braking.  Another
factor to consider is your choice of brake pad compounds.
I have been very happy with the Pagid racing pads which I've
used since Bob started originally importing them in 1993.  
Though pricey by appearance, they offer phenomenal pad
wear, with minimal rotor damage.  There certainly are other
*good* pads available today, and I'm aware that opinions
vary wildly.  I just know that the Pagids work best for me.

Regarding pads, the other consideration is the specific
compound used front/rear.  You might want to try using
a harder compound at the rear than front, as this is another
way to change your *bias*.  It works for me.

2)BFG R1 tire pressures:

I run 315/35 rears, 245/45 fronts.  A good, safe, cold starting
point is 26# front, 30# rear.  The R1's can be run with a LOT
less pressure than this, but many factors must be considered,
including weight of the car.  I do think the 4# difference from
front to rear is pretty much written in stone, based on my
own trials.  

I would be happy to further discuss these issues further
outside the Racing Digest.  Feel free to e-mail me.
