Hi Joe,

So my rental prices were close, but my expenses a little low. OK, I can
work with that.

So that's 9 track days on the tires and brakes. That's pretty close to 
my estimate for tires (I was thinking 5 races @ 2 days / race = 10 days).
What tires were those, R1's?

There is much more wear for the front brakes than I expected. I'm surprised,
because I've driven 8 days (1 race [2 days], and 6 DE days) on my front
brakes, and there is still about %40 of the pad material left. I would
think that a NA car would be easier on brakes, as it's lighter and slower.
Those are Performance Friction PF 80 compound, BTW.

I'm not considering the cost of the car because it's something I want to
do for me. I'm just thinking that since I can't afford to drive in that
many races a year, that I could perhaps rent the car out for some events,
and reduce my expenses. I understand that there's no way to actually
MAKE money at this stuff, I just don't want to spend as much.

I think you should be able to build a competive car for much less than
10K, closer to 6K (assuming a running car for 3K that doesn't need too
much work).  If you don't mind, could you give me list of the expensive
items?  Does that cost include a spare set or two of race wheels? You
could easily spend a ton of money on things like that, but you can also
get 7 X 15 phone dials for about $50 / wheel. Same thing with seats,
$700 for a Recaro, vs. $150 for a Kirkey. Run 951 Turbo sway bars (set
costs $100-$150) vs new Weltmeister.

I'm also not including the costs of spares, trailer, tow vehicle, etc.
in my car building expenses, although that stuff has to come from somewhere.

Very true. I have to decide how much wear is from me, and how much from
renters to determine the cost of this. I do most (all?) the work myself,
so my labor is cheap.

> IMO:  RENTING such a 944 is a great idea for someone who is not sure about

The more I think about it, the more I think the real Club Race market
is not such a hot idea. Perhaps taking the Driver Ed rental approach
would be better. This way, getting the last second from the car isn't
so important, and the other associated costs go down. Of course, 
people won't pay the same price as for racing, but it's all relative.
