Jim,
    From the BFG folks, if you run much under 30 psi hot you'll get the
groove of doom quick. You can't use sidewall flex shape to indicate when
there's enough air in them, either. Mike Dayton had a problem with a seal on
his new wheels and the tire looked a little low, but had 0 psi. Those
sidewalls are really stiff.

    I ran (and am still running) 245/45-16's in front and 275/40-17's in the
rear on my SC/Carrera(similar sizes to yours if no one else has any better
ideas). I start my day with the tires 30 psi front /32 psi rear, and bleed
them after every session to obtain 32 F/34 R hot. This seemed to work for me
without too much wear. Occasionally I would run them lower, but tried not to
in  order to make them last longer (went through 4 sets last year anyway).
You will end up with different cold pressures from side to side with the side
towards the outside of the track having a lower tire pressure. Guess I'll
have to take into account we will be running both directions this weekend
somehow. Should be interesting.
    
For nitrogen vs. air question, here's my thought. Am I correct? 

PV = nRT still applies.
Volume is constant V=nRT/P
 nRT1/P1 = nRT1/P2  Volume while cold (1) = Volume while hot(2) 
                                  n and R cancel out
T1/P1 = T2/P2
Pressure is related to tempurature only, right?
Nitrogen might react slower with the rubber inside the tire, thus reducing
the rate of dry rot, but who can use tires that long anyway, right ?   <G>

Hope to see you Sunday. Got any extra lights yet???????
