Okay, many thanks to everyone who gave me Hank's humber at GT Racing. For
everyone's information, Hank is the orginal designer of the Club Racing
logo and he sells decals that come in either 18" or 24" designs, one-color
or 4 color. His number is 1-800-797-2911 if you need these decals.

I'm looking for the smaller decals (Hank says some other people are
apparently making these). Seems like every Club Racing car has them;
they're just like Hank's except they're about 6" by 4" and are perfect for
the bumper or small side windows of the car. This is
racing@porschefans.com. I *know* someone reading this has these stickers
on their car. Out with it! Where can I get some these?? Thanks!
