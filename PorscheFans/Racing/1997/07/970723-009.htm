James,

A good friend of mine just did the same thing recently.  His first outing at
Heartland Park he had some of the same problems.  Very frustrating!  Turned
out that the rotors and pads had never bedded-in.  Afterwards he started over
with street pads to get them set-up.  The problems are but a fading memory
now.  He just returned from Road Atlanta with nothing but smiles.  This may
not be the same for your situation but he didn't have to mess with any
different valving.

Good luck,

Zane Dobson
