Barry:

Having just built an '85 944 into a competitive club racer, I think your
figures are a bit low.

A very good local shop (Schnieder Motorsports) has just built such a car and
offers it for rental at $500/day for DE events and $750 for race events (I
think.... call them directly for an exact quotation which I think would
depend on the race location).  They have it reserved for Heartland Park, the
owner raced it at Brainerd, and they have had some interest from people
wanting to run an SCCA school (requires full roll cage).

As far as Jay's concern goes.... in all cases of rental racers I know of, a
contract is signed agreeing that the renter is responsible for any damage
done to the car.  

I agree with Jay that your per race estimates of consumables is a bit low.
I have run my 944 for 2 race weekends and one DE weekend so far this summer
(all 3 day events).  I've worn out the equivalent of one set of tires and
one set of front brake pads (the rears still look new).  I run Porterfield
pads that run around $120 for just the fronts!

Another factor to consider is the cost of building the car.  I suspect that
the "rent-ability" of the car is much better if it is well set up, and not
just "legal for racing".  Even if you buy the project car for say $3,000 and
do all the work yourself (and call it fun, because putting a value on your
time will make it look REALLY expensive), I don't think a competitive car
can be done for less than $10k and probably closer to $15k.

Don't forget the "incidental" expenses.  Say... like a water pump that was
smooth and quiet when you build the car, but you discover is really bad
right before an event when you don't have time do it yourself.  (that was a
$600+ lesson!)  BTW:  Big thanks to Bob Viau at Auto Edge for spending a
whole day on my car with no appointment so I could go play!

IMO:  RENTING such a 944 is a great idea for someone who is not sure about
going racing regularly.  Compared to the cost of going racing in your own
car, even $2,000 per weekend (as a total cost), is not unreasonable for a
trial event.  Remember that as an owner, you need to have the car, a
trailer, and a tow vehicle!

Also IMO:  Building such a car is probably the most fun for the buck
available in PCA.  There is plenty of competition without having to spend
the $40k+ I suspect it would cost to build a competitive class F car.  There
is also a huge comfort factor in NOT putting my baby ('87 Carrera) at risk
on the track anymore.

Best Regards, good luck, let us know what you decide to do!

>   $120 / race
>2. Gas - 20 gallons of 93 octane should do it
