Guys,

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you but after the Brainerd race Sue
and I went to deepest, darkest Iowa for the wedding of my sister-in-law and
just got back about an hour ago.  Really nice that the Republican controlled
congress gave control of speed limits back to the states and allowed us to
navigate Nebraska and Wyoming in record time.  Anyway:

The Nord Stern Region did another outstanding job in putting together this
years PCA Club Race.  Friday, June 20 was a practice day for racers and
driver's ed people, followed by race tech and the orientation meeting.  We
had 87 registered racers for this years race and, of those, 12 were first
time PCA Club racers.  The increased number of competitors was due in no
small part to the work of Teresa Vickery, event chair, and Roger Johnson,
registrar.  Brainerd is really an exciting track to drive and, hopefully, the
number of racers will continue to grow.

At last years Brainerd race we started Saturday morning with eight corner
workers and, until we found some more, almost didn't race.  This year, Joel
Pfitzer did an outstanding job and we had 45 trained workers and he actually
had a waiting list of people who wanted to work the race.  The group that he
recruited was outstanding as was tech, control, grid, emergency vehicles and,
except for the final two sessions, timing and scoring.  Almost without
exception, timing had each run group sheets ready almost before racers got
out of their cars.  Then, at race time, the computer decided to glitch during
both race groups, the lap charts had to be manually fed into the beast and,
of course, it took a while to get final results.  Really frustrating for a
group that did such a good job throughout the weekend.  In that the final
race results are one of the least important parts of a Club racing weekend
and that their lack did little to erase the smiles and hugs, it did little to
diminish an exciting weekend.

Saturday we had more than our fair share of incidents, but the majority of
participants kept the proper perspective and had a safe and fun time.  The
social that evening, as always, was well run and everyone had a good time
(even if a Saturn won the people's choice award in the concours!).  There
were some veiled charges of ballot stuffing but . . .

One of the things that makes the Brainerd race so enjoyable is the membership
of Nord Stern Region and this year was no exception.  Truly a great group to
be around, they make you feel like part of the family and if you have not
raced there, do it.

While I'm sure there are others who had more fun, the following is a list of
racers who crossed the finish line ahead of other drivers in their class:

GT1R	Steve Watson
GT2R	Peter Kitchak
GT3R	Rick Polk
GT3S	Mike Hoke
GT2S	Bob Johnson
C		Fred Senn
E		Ron Smith
GT4S	Jennifer Bretzel
F		Roger Johnson
H		Scott Sanda
G		Bruce Boeder
I		Jim Bryant
GT5S	Tom Salstad
J		Eric Pilhofer

Both John Crosby, national scrutineer, and I had a great time at Brainerd and
if you want a really fun event to attend next year, put this one on your
schedule.

Monte
