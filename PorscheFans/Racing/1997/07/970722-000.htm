Hey, this is a great hiding place!

Now all I have to do is figure out how in the heck they pull it off!

Yeah - it's weird!  Like there's a certain channel and the car just
seems to float right through the cones.  My problem is I went into most
turns way too hot and was hanging the tail out, gassing it to remain in
control - this couldn't be the fastest way through the corner at all.
Plus I'm surprised at how tail-happy the 928 was.  I was running mfg.
spec of 44psi rears though.   The car definately did not display this
behavior while I was chasing a friend on a mountain road (with 36psi all
around) and thank god for that too!  I'll need to try this again (AX
that is) and get plenty of help and critique from the
instructor/observers...

For sure!  Man was I wiped at the end of that day - guess I had like no
adrenaline left, slept for 14 hours!
