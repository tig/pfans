And the answer is, yes! I'm not able to used so-called scientific
instruments to measure the actual temperature difference but I can tell
you there is a noticeable difference on a properly working temperature
gauge. If you're having cooling problems, try some and see if it helps. On
to the details, I drained (sucked rather) 14 ozs. of coolant from my
radiator and replaced it with 12 ozs. of WaterWetter. I then took the car
on a drive to get the stuff mixed in with the coolant thoroughly. Redline
claims up to a 30 degree reduction in temperature assuming you're running
pure water. I have a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water so my results were
going to be somewhat less. I am experiencing a very definate drop in
temps. according to my gauge. Most of the time, the needle hovers just
above the first slender, slash mark. Rarely it will rise to slightly more
than halfway. It has yet to go high enough to cause fan #2 to kick in. If
you remember my description from the long Cooling Problem from Hell post,
you can see the improvement. For those who don't, the needle usually
stayed right at the halfway mark between the two slashes and would
sometimes rise as high as the second mark or a little higher. It's no
where near that high now. I talked to my shop about WaterWetter and they
said that they'd seen performance like this but the problem they had was
that it wouldn't last very long. I added the stuff on 3/10/97 and I've put
about 250 miles on it since then and it's doing great. We'll see what
happens. I'll keep you guys informed...
