   Our 89 944S2 has not started a couple times. It just cranks over and has
plenty of battery but won't lite. After sitting a few minutes and playing
with the door locks it fires right off. Does the alarm shut the fuel off and
not the starter motor? The car is a race car with a cutoff switch which we
reset a few times to no avail. The central door lock system has not worked
since I've owned the car, hence playing with the door locks. Any Ideas?

Lemmy no,

 BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
 or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
