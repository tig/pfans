I have to agree with Dave Ingraha on his impression of Bondurant.  I haven't 
been to any of the other schools, but after 50 or so PCA days, I attended the 4 
day course at Bondurant two weeks ago and I highly recommend it.

The instruction at PCA events has been excellent, but now that I am in a higher 
run group, I don't get to spend as much time with instructors as I would like.  
The instructors at Bondurant are all "near or at" professional drivers, and if 
they could find a sponsored ride......  You may not learn anything that is 
unfamiliar or brand new, but I am clearly faster/safer than I was before I 
went, and isn't that what really counts.
