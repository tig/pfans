Hey dudes,

Here is the schedule for those going down to the Kent, WA auto-x event at
Boeing. You can get exact details of how to get from I5 to the event from
the Western Washington Sports Car Council web site.  

Anyone in B.C. or Western Washington is welcome to join us, I know that
the following people are attending for sure:

Paul     89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Lou      89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Darren   87 944 Turbo (chipped)
Me       89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Squamish 97 944S (I've lost this guys email so I hope he gets this email)
Tom Putz 89 944 Turbo (stock) I'm gonna try and convince Tom and his Son to
                              autocross their car :)

The Canadian contingent is meeting at the Peace Arch border at 6:00am.
There may be others from our region coming down with us too (non p-cars).



Since there is only one person from WA coming that has never done this
before, I don't think we will stop at South Center this time.  We'll
just meet Tom at the event site.  Tom, if you need instructions, I can get
them off the web for you on how to get there.

As usual, ANY of the p-car Canadians are more than willing to take ANY
passenger for a ride (as long as they sign the waiver), so if you've never
done this before and are looking for a way to experience it, come up to ANY
one of us and we'll take you for a run.  It's quite something when 17 
pounds of boost come on as the driver exits the tight bend on slicks in 
the rain and you have ZERO control over your future destiny :)

Paul and I are also going to attempt to assist with Tech, with Bill Buetow's
assistance.

I hope to see more people out this time, we had 7 last time, I want to bring
more this time.

Any questions, let me know.

Farzaan.
89 951 - 14psi (hoping for a wet weekend, I need the practice!)
