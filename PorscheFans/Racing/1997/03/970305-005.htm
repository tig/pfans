Definitely do not use those bolts.  Go to a hardware store that
specializes in fasteners and get grade 8.8 or higher, fine thread bolts
of the proper size.  Also get the same grade aircraft nuts, wavy/split
washers and fender washer. I personally like socket head machine bolts,
grade 10.9...the heads look really good when the cage is mounted.  For
each mounting hole, a complete assembly (bolt/washers/aircraft nut)
should cost around $2.00-3.00; expensive but well worth the investment.

The corresponding metric size is 10 mm.  I like using metric because it
matches everything else, including the wrenches.  Good luck with your
project.
