SEBRING, Fla (March 12, 1997) -- Professional SportsCar Racing, Inc.
officially becomes the new name for the International Motor Sports
Association, Inc. on Friday, March 14, when it formally introduces the new
name and logo in a news conference at Sebring International Raceway in
Sebring, Florida. The new name better represents what the sports car racing
sanctioning body does and is one
of several major changes to the organization since it was purchased in
September 1996 by the International Motorsports Speedway Group (IMSG), a
group of investors led by former Reebok International president Roberto
Muller and Seattle-based investment banker Andrew Evans. Rather than creating
an acronym for the new organization, like IMSA, USAC or NASCAR, the brand
name of the sanctioning body will be SportsCar, which is featured prominently
in the striking new logo.
"As we are the premier sanctioning body for professional sports car racing in
North America, we felt we needed the name of our company to better reflect
what we do," said Jack Long, CEO of Professional SportsCar Racing, Inc. and
IMSG. "Now our job is to focus on converting the growing popularity of sports
cars and sports car racing into a solid fan base and long-term marketing
partnerships."
"Sports car racing is enjoying a tremendous renaissance with manufacturer,
sponsor and fan interest on a sharp upswing " said Andrew Evans, chairman of
Professional SportsCar Racing, Inc. "With the help of our sponsors, promoters
and members, we will present a sport that everyone can benefit from and
enjoy." Professional SportsCar Racing, Inc. sanctions five different series
including the Exxon World
SportsCar Championship, Exxon Supreme GT Series presented by Virgin
Interactive, the Endurance Championship (for stock sports cars), Black Magic
Pro Series and Ferrari Challenge.
