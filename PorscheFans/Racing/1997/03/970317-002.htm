Farzaan,

I live here in Portland, OR and do not know of one in this area.  If you 
can't find one another option would be one of the new accelerometer devices 
that you plug into your cigarette lighter.  This device is less than $200 
and gives you very accurate acceleration numbers from which it calculates 
HP, G force, etc.  I don't have one but some one on the list probably does. 
 I believe Racers Wholesale sells them (and many other sources).  Suppose 
to work very well.

Good luck,

Scott

Hey guys and girls,

I am looking for a chasis dyno (wheel dyno) in the Western US or Western
Canada.  I have a bunch of computer chips laying around and K&N filters,
etc. and want a difinitive answer to some power questions I have.  Seat
of the pants only goes so far before it becomes numb, so I want to test
various different parts and give their results out for the p-fans to see.

But, I can't find anywhere to dyno my car, so if you know of anywhere
around Western US or Western Canada that has one, let me know.  I'm
willing to drive up to 5-6 hours to use one for a couple of hours.
I'm in Burnaby, B.C. Canada.  Don't you guys down in Washington have
anything?  What about Portland?

Farzaan.
