      ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 5, 1997--

    Sebring International Raceway to be site of Worldwide
          Notification Systems' second trial run for state-of-the-art
                             GPS Tracking System
          When the green flag comes down, the technology takes off.
          On Saturday, March 15 at the Superflo 12 Hours of Sebring, the 
WNS(TM) Alex Job Porsche Racing Team (Porsche 25, driven by Jeff Purner)
will be equipped with amazing technology that monitors in real-time, 
the location, speed and lap count of a car traveling well over 160 
mph on a custom-computerized map of the Sebring International 
Raceway.
          Through the integration of GPS (Global Positioning System) 
technology, digital mapping, wireless communications and customized 
computer software programs, Worldwide Notification Systems(TM) (WNS) 
is alone in the field as the first company in the nation to have 
successfully introduced and tested GPS tracking during a 24-hour 
sports car endurance race -- the 1997 Rolex 24 in Daytona, Fla.
          Worldwide Notification Systems, Inc. is the official sponsor of 
the WNS Alex Job Porsche Racing Team.  As one of the favorites in the
IMSA GTS-3 class, this championship team is just the team to 
represent WNS.  They're both on the fast track.  "We had our first 
opportunity to see this product really put to the test in Daytona -- 
it's amazing.  You're front and center around every corner," said 
Jeff Purner, driver for WNS Porsche Racing Team.  The WNS team for 
Sebring includes Jeff Purner, Robbie Groff, Charles Slater and Terry 
Lingner.  Lingner serves as the independent producer of ESPN's 
SpeedWeek(TM) and SpeedVision.
          Exactly what does this technology mean for the racing community?
Right out of the blocks, WNS products will improve track and pit 
safety, plus provide real-time car speed and position on the track.  
Future WNS plans may enable spectators to "see" entire road races 
with a hand-held monitor; they will see all the cars at once -- and 
see them in relation to each other -- who's in the lead, how fast 
they're going and more.  It's even possible that fans will be able to
give these professional drivers a run for their money at an on-site 
interactive display.
          Consumers will be fans of this cutting-edge technology too as it 
is designed to increase the safety and security of drivers all over 
the world.  Plus, it will enable commercial fleet management 
companies to effectively track their vehicle and cargo investments 
from one end of the earth to the other.  It guarantees just-in-time 
delivery, updating recipients of delivery arrivals.  At any given 
time, auto clubs, for instance, will be able to track the location of
stolen vehicles, alert police as to the precise vehicle location or 
dispatch emergency roadside service in the case of accidents, flat 
tires, even empty gas tanks.  This technology utilizes software that 
enables staff at a state-of-the-art tracking center to remotely 
unlock your car should your keys accidentally be locked inside -- 24 
hours a day.  This GPS technology is far superior to the currently 
available radio-based products in terms of accuracy, timeliness and 
the ability to track vehicles on a global scale.
          Worldwide Notification Systems, Inc. designs tracking and 
notification products that are used in conjunction with The Global 
Positioning System, or GPS, a public-use network of 24 NAVSTAR 
satellites.  WNS holds a U.S. patent for this state-of-the-art 
technology, plus four additional U.S. registered patents with two 
more pending.
          Based and founded in 1989 in Atlanta, Worldwide Notification 
Systems, Inc. is currently a privately-held company with 20 
employees.  WNS specializes in the successful integration of GPS in 
vehicle hardware, digital processing, client server computing, 
digital mapping and wireless communication technologies to provide 
solutions for air and maritime-based tracking too -- not just asphalt
and concrete race tracks.
