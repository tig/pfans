Regarding the posting below on Driving Schools, I've done both Jim Russell
at Laguna Seca, and Bondurant's 4 day GPRR school at his Firebird facility
in Phoenix.  Can't personally comment on Skip Barber.  My experience at
Bondurant was very favorable.  Key benefits are a lot of personalized
instruction (3 students to each instructor), a lot of seat time (you don't
share your car), terrific facilities with great learning tools (skid cars,
Mustangs, and Formula Fords), and very knowledgeable instructors.  I would
highly recommend it, while the first day is very repetitive if you have been
to a good PCA Driver's Ed school -- you still get a lot of good practice and
feedback.  The only shortcoming relative to Barber and Russell might be the
lack of a "name track".  Bondurant's primary track for the schools was
designed and built for instruction purposes.  It is terrific for that -- but
isn't a spectacular, historic site like some of the other tracks.

Relative to Russell, it's strengths were more emphasis on racing passes, and
Laguna Seca's track (when they were headquartered there).  As far as
instruction, and quality of the car maintenance there was no comparison to
Bondurant.  Bondurant services all the cars whenever you take a break for
classroom sessions, or lunch.  At Russell they were struggling to keep all
the cars out on the track, and since you share a car there isn't a lot of
time for them to make repairs between sessions.  Still a fun time though.
