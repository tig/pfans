My 914 runs too hot and suffers oil starvation in left turns.  I am sure both
of these problems are common to 914 racers.  I am not a mechanic so I would
be eternally grateful to anyone who could light my path.

Does anyone have experience with mounting an oil cooler in the back, above
the right axle?  How much does the oil temperature drop?  Can you use the
stock oil pump?  What did you use for the actual cooler, and how did you
mount it?  Did you duct air in and/or out?  Is it necessary to protect it
from flying rocks?  Is an oil thermostat necessary, and if so what
temperature range is best for a mostly track car?

One suggestion for oil starvation is an Accusump.  I've heard of them, but
know nothing about them.  Cost?  Availability?  Do they solve the problem?
 Is it possible to "drain" the Accusump resevoir?  Are there other solutions
short of the dreaded dry-sump?

Racing this car is the one thing I most want in my life right now.  I am
desperate for (effective yet budget-conscious) solutions.  Your help could
save my sanity or my financial independence, or both.

Thank you!
