I have one of these devices and while it works quite well (G-tech), it 
doesn't give me any sort of resolution of the numbers.  I want to test
various different chips and while one chip may make 280hp peak and the
other 275hp at peak, I want to know what chip produces what power and
at what RPM to determine the difference between stock chips, aftermarket
chips, and Porsche Motorsports/Andial chips in bottom end and top end
power.  I also want to quantify K&N filters, etc and that small level
of HP is hard to measure by an accelerometer.

But, I do thank you for your quick and accurate response.

Farzaan.
