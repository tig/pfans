Presumably the goal of most F1 teams is to be competitive.  Presumably the
goal of most PCA club racers is first to race and have fun, and secondly to
be competitive.  This is an important difference.  For me, I'm on the
verge of starting to run the POC racing clinics.  I'll be at the back of
the pack, duelling with 2 or more 914 2.0Ls that, while being left behind
by the rest of the pack, still have lots of fun racing each other.
