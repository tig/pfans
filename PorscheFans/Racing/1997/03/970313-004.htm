Rich Brown 

Jack Long, CEO of International Motorsports Speedway Group (IMSG)

Question from Fritz Jean Charles of Montreal-North, Quebec, Canada: "The
Philosophy of this sanctioning body."
Jack Long: "Professional SportsCar Racing's philosophy is to take
Professional
SportsCar Racing to the next level of motor sport providing a sound business
and
entertainment base."


Question from Rich Brown of Gary, Indiana: "The European "Supercars" are
currently
shut out of the IMSA series. Will IMSA introduce changes to it's rules to
stimulate
participation by the major marquees?"
Jack Long: "Professional SportsCar Racing has initiated a dialog with the FIA
with a
goal of developing a common rules package that will be acceptable to both
parties.
There is no time table for the completion of this discussion, but just
participating in the dialog brings us closer to a mutually beneficial rules
package.


Question from George Allegrezza of Worcester, Massachusetts: "Jack, how do
you
see IMSA's future rules package shaping up? FIA GT's, WSC's, Le Mans protos
or
some combination thereof?"
see answer 2 above.


Question from John Turpin of Edmond, Oklahoma: "Jack, will we see a turbo
formula
for WSC? There is a lot of fan grumbling out there for Porsche, Nissan, etc.
in WSC.
Jack Long: see answer 2 above and add: "Professional SportsCar Racing is
attempting to put a product on the race track that is acceptable to our fans
and that is consistent with the goals and objectives of our competitors. I
believe the fans will like the product that sports cars will be delivering to
race tracks in North America."


Question from John Turpin : "There is talk of going to a single IMSA class.
This would obviously be WSC. Is this imminent? Near? Just a rumor?"
Jack Long: "I believe this rumor is a misunderstood discussion that has
developed
regarding the desirability of a single GT class to run within the World
SportsCar group. While these discussions are proceeding no resolution has
been determined as to the feasibility to such a single class GT structure.
Discussion on this subject will continue."


Question from Daryl Daulong of Mesquite, Texas: "Why was Dallas dropped from
the
IMSA venue?"
Jack Long: "SportsCar determined that particular Dallas venue was not a
viable long
term opportunity.


Question from Steve Rundell of Seattle, WA: "When are you going to get the
1997
Code on the Web site?"
Jack Long: "As there are no immediate plans to put the 1997 CODE on the web
site,
however, contact our office at 813-877-4672 and they will mail it to you."


Question from Mike Ducharme of Boston, MA: "Is IMSA/IMSG planning more
concurrent rounds with the FIA World GT Championship for 1998?"
Jack Long: "We are currently in negotiations to determine if increasing the
number of
rounds of the FIA World GT Championship in 1998 is desirable and if it is in
fact
possible."


Question from Bruce Mills of Toronto: "Why do press releases as late as Feb
27 still
show Mosport as an IMSA property, is there any chance the deal will still
happen?"
Jack Long: "Under advice of council It would be in appropriate to speculate
at this
time."


Question from Sue Wuerthner Fastbenz @ AOL.com: "Do you have any plans for
promoting your drivers in the Supreme Series so the public can identify with
them all and not just a select few ?"
Jack Long: "I'm proud to announce we just recently announced Sid Priddle the
Vice
President of Communications. Sid is developing a communications plan that
will
certainly improve profiles of all our drivers in all series."


Question from Eric Weiman of East Hampton, CT: "Are there any plans to
formulate a WSC-lights series?"
Jack Long: "While there have been recent suggestions that a WSC lights series
be
considered we are not currently planning a return to that racing format in
the immediate future."


Question from Chelsea of Phoenix: "Do you think that girls can race as good
as boys?"
Jack Long: "Yes. In my racing experience I've had the pleasure watching Lyn
St.
James develop and I feel it is only a matter of time that we have a
significant number of female drivers competing in all forms of motorsports."


Question from Dave Hardee of Sugar Hill,GA: "When do you think the European
GT1's will show up?"
Jack Long: "They will show up in October 1997 at Sebring October 18 and
Luguna
Seca October 26. The FIA GT1 cars will be competing in the final two rounds
of the
FIA GT World Championship."


Question from Robert Irvin of Charlotte: "For IMSA to grow & be a successful
org. it
needs: public interest, TV coverage, more Manufacturer involvement &
sponsors. What are the plans to achieve this?"
Jack Long: "I agree these areas amoung others need to be developed for
SportsCar to grow in this country. I can tell you that we at Professional
SportsCar Racing have a plan to address all these areas and employ best
practices in all of the functions we carry out."


Question from Joshua Johnson Iowa City, IA: "Does IMSA or IMSG offer
internships in the business aspect of racing and what should I do to have the
best
possible chance to get an internship?"
Jack Long: "That's an interesting concept, why don't you write me a letter
explaining
how such an internship will work."


Question from Rick McCornick Cantonment, FL: "Does IMSA intend to run joint
WSC/GT races after Sebring this year as last year? I am particularly
interested in FIA GT races at Sebring and Laguna Seca."
Jack Long: "Professional SportsCar Racing plans to race the WSC and GT series
in
separate races after Sebring in 1997. The FIA GT races will be run as a
separate event at both Sebring and Laguna Seca."


Question from Jim Morford, II of Tucson, AZ: "Sir: Is IMSA doing anything to
increase the number of its races televised (say on ESPN or other networks?)"
Jack Long: "Television is an integral part of our short and long term
marketing mix. We expect to make further television announcements soon."


Question from JOE F. Tampa Fl.: "Do you think Daytona and Sebring will be
part of
endurance crown in 1998?"
Jack Long: "Yes."


Question from Glenn Cirlincione of Renton, WA: "Are there any plans to return
to
Portland, Oregon?"
Jack Long: "Professional SportsCar Racing continues to examine any racing
venue that will be a benefit for both the series and the spectators."


Question from Tony Lopez of Fremont, Ca: "Street Stock: Acura Integra GSR
should
be in Touring not Sport. It is matched to the cars in tour better than sport.
We would
like to race ours with you rather than SCCA."
Jack Long: "I would suggest that you direct your inquiry to Doug Robinson of
the
Professional SportsCar Racing, inc. VP of Race Operations."


Question from Juan Mansilla of Miami, Florida: "Does imsa plan to add a wsc
class to its racing series, i allways thought that a class that will allow a
specseries racer with a 4 cylinder engine will be fun."
Jack Long: "Professional SportsCar Racing is always reviewing it's options to
add
viable entry level racing series to our schedule. Please e-mail Doug
Robinson, VP of
Race Operations, your thoughts on the subject."


Question from Stephen Miernicki of Fort Wayne: "On March1 1996, I sent an 18
page letter of suggestions to IMSA. It was replied to by George Silbermann.
Have you seen a copy of that letter?"
Jack Long: "No. I don't recall reviewing any such document. If you wish to
send to my attention, I would be happy to consider your views."


Question from Dick Coburn of Windsor, Ontario: "Are you acquiring Mosport &
will
you improve the washrooms? What other improvements for fans & turn marshals
do
you propose?"

comfort
features as part of upgrading those properties. "
