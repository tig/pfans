Accusumps

Downshift asks about an Accusump for his 914 to cure oil starvation on
cornering.  I think Racer Wholesale or Pegasus or both carry the
Accusump, and Downshift needs to equip himself with these useful
catalogs, in which he will also find armored oil line hose, oil line fittings,
coolers, and other stuff he will need, as well as stuff he didn't think he
needed.  The Accusump is not a hard to obtain item.  Price with some
parts needed for installation somewhere under $300, depending on
whether you get the electric valve.  

I used one on a VW I ran in the Carrerra Panamericana.  Pretty simple to
plumb in if you already have a remote oil cooler.  Buy the large (3 quart?)
one, don't skimp.  These folks also sell mounting straps (you need 2) and
brackets.  I faked it with really long hose clamps, but that's not really the
right way.  

Were I to do it over I would find the $ for the electric valve also.  I
attached a choke cable I could pull over my shoulder to the manual valve,
but kept forgetting to use it, which meant the sump, when engine was
shut down, was overfilled with the 2 quarts of oil from the Accusump. 
Turned out not to be a big deal, as on starting the sump quickly cleared
out and refilled the Accusump without spewing oil out the breather or
some other engine case orfice.   Maybe if I had bought the bigger 3 quart
version I would have had a spewing problem to reward my
forgetfulness.  But this also meant I could not use the Accusump to
prelubricate the engine before starting, which is another neat feature of
this device, though hardly essential.  An electric valve would allow
placement on the dash somewhere where I might have remembered it
more often as part of the engine shutdown routine.  But then again, I
was probably at the same place he is when it comes to money back
then.

You should get some responses from people who have used the
Accusump, as it is popular with the 356ers who race. 

I write from my office, far from my stash of catalogs and books, and I
posted it on the 911 list by mistake, but Andrew Warren -
fastfwd@ix.netcom.com, Fast Forward Engineering - Vista, California
posted these useful numbers there to get you started:    Racer
Wholesale:  800 886-RACE -   Pegasus Racing:   800 688-6946
