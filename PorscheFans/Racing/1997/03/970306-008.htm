>I am looking for advice on what would be appropriate 
>oil pan baffling for an '86 951 which will (hopefully)
>get 8 to 10 track days per year at SE US tracks.
>Major enhancements are/will be a cage, chip, R1's,
>kevlar brake lines and front strut bar.
>
>I have read in the 944 Corner FAQ that I should get 
>the '89 951 baffle (PN 944.107.389.03).  
>
>The first complication is that a parts-counter-person
>told me their microfiche indicated that there was a
>whole slew of oil pan baffle related parts for the '89
>951, not just the one I knew of, and that installing 
>these parts was complicated enough to warrant a 
>dedicated service bulletin.  I assume he meant 
>complicated once the pan was off, with just getting
>that far looking fairly unpleasant.
>
>The second complication is that an aftermarket parts
>purveyor (offering a $400+ oil pan) indicated that all
>factory baffle configurations worked only in right turns,
>but that their design worked also in left turns.  While
>most of the tracks I visit have primarily right turns, 
>both Roebling and Summit Point have significant left
>hand sweepers.  I am reminded that with other engine
>designs that over-baffling can also cause oil starvation 
>problems.
>
>So:  Is the stock '89 setup OK?  Does it consist of
>more that the infamous 944.107.389.03?  Is the $400+
>aftermarket setup worthwhile, and/or does it solve
>more problems than it causes?  I'd really appreciate
>any ideas/thoughts/guesses or whatever.
>
>P.S.
>I hope to God that this posting doesn't get infinitely
>replicated, and I am sure any would-be advisors out 
>there must be similarly gun-shy.  I know it reduces
>the knowledge transfer, but perhaps it might be best
>to reply directly to me until things stabilize.  I will also
>send this posting separately to 924-944@PorscheFans,
>to avoid the possible multi-post problem.
