Just wanted to relay an incident that happened here in my hometown, and illust
rates the need for safety awareness in your shop area. A long time racer and
classic car owner was removing the fuel tank from a car when his shop light
fell and broke, igniting some gasoline which had spilled from the tank. His
shop area was almost instantly engulfed, and several classic cars, including
an original AC Cobra, and also a 427 side oiler Cobra engine were lost. This
is just an example of why you should never, ever use an old style shop light
when working around anything flammable. Luckily the man escaped with his life,
but to lose that Cobra, oh, man, how awful!!
