Here's the secret to cheap, good looking, easy on, easy off race numbers: 
 
                   SHELF PAPER AND STENCILS	 
 
Get yourself a set of stencils for numbers 1-0 at an office supply store, sign 
store, whatever.  Get them as large as is required, 8", 10" whatever. 
 
Go to your hardware/houseware/grocery store and get a roll of shelf paper($5) 
in a color that will contrast with your car.  This stuff comes in white, 
black, red, b/w checkerboard, white with black cow markings....you won't 
believe the choices...... 
 
Trace the numbers you need, cut em out and stick 'em on the car.  Wax the 
surfaces you're putting them on and they will peel off easily without harming 
the cheapest of paint jobs.  And they won't fly off( Guaranteed for 120mph) 
 
Good project for the kids or pit tootsie...... 
 
Ted 
 
PS:  experiment with the clear shelf paper stuff.  Put your cut out #s onto 
clear paper and stick 'em on, peel 'em off.....reuse 'em......

Hi Guys,

Back in February, when I was at Sears Point to watch a NASA race, I saw
many cars with numbers made by a business called "Fast Signs of San
Fransisco" or something like that. The numbers were on a rectangular
sticker, and looked to be easy to apply and to remove.

Does anyone have the phone number for that place? Are those numbers PCA
Club Race legal? Does anyone know how well they work? When you remove
them, does your paint get damaged? Any other ideas for race numbers?

Thanks,
Barry Lenoble
