 Hy
I just want to present my self even if sounds stupid!
I'm a portuguese guy who came to England to study Automobile Eng. I
woulnd't came to England if it wasn't for Porsche. I startec when i
was 12 and i bought a spanish magazine ( Motor16 ) with a big picture
of a 930. After that i became a maniac of car magazine. But i still
believe that if it wasn't for the slight chamnce that i have that some
day i might work for Porsche i don't think i would leave that
beautiful country to study here. It is a big passion. Even bigger when
they are racing Porsche. Like Ferdinand Porsche said i think without
the racing department Porsche couldn't live and vice-versa. I would
also like to congratulate whoever started this mailing-list.

P.S - I had some problems finding the best Porsche webs. Can anyone
give me some help? There are a lot of webs that don't have any
information.
