   Thanx for the help Dave, but we found the problem today after going thru
the schematics in the manuals. There is an alarm control unit just behind
the DME unit on the passanger side floor boards. It was mounted in such a
way that a small water leak filled the plastic cover on this control unit
with many many relays and chips and resistors in it and shorting it out
where it decided to cut the spark and fuel ;-(
   Apparently, when my freind took the car to detail it he parked at just
the perfect angle so that the minute water leak the car has dripped
perfectly into this relay cover, what are the odds? Anyway, we used some
brakeclean and electrical contact cleaner and blew it out with an air hose
and the car started!! YAAAYYYYY!!  I will order a new alarm control unit and
install it monday.
   Man what a releif, my SCCA liscencing school is tomorrow and I didn't
want to have to miss it because of a silly glitch like the race car won't
start ;-)

Hope this helps,

,

 BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
 or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
