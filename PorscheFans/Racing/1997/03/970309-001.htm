Jay,

I've been researching this same idea.  I'm in the same situation.  I've done
25+ PCA events, I don't want to waste my time or money.  I know how to drive
around other cars at speed so I want to learn more about racing.  Three other
PCAers here have been to Bondurant 4 day school.  They are all positive about
the results.
I talked to the rep at Bondurant the other day, he was very realistic about
what would be learned in the 4 day.  So.........

I have always heard that Skip Barber or Jim Russell was better for learning
about racing.  Maybe learn more in their 3 day events versus the more
expensive 4 day.

So with no money to burn, I guess I would like to know more as well.

Zane
