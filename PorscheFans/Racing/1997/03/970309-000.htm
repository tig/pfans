	Yuck, yuck, yuck, I kill me sometimes. My longer, more in-depth
	post about the improvements the Konis made has arrived. First
	off, Doug Donsbach mailed me and mentioned that his seemed to
	ride smoother with the new Konis than with his worn out shocks
	even though the Konis are much stiffer. I concur, with this
	minor dissention; the big bumps are definately much better.
	You're over them and down them before you know it and they're
	instantly forgotten. However, you do feel all the little bumps
	that your worn out shocks gently floated you over. With the
	Konis, it can be like running over a little pebbled road
	if they road surface your on has a lot of these little bumps.
	Other than that, I have no complaints. On to the more technical
	aspects...

	First (and this a great and unexpected feature), the car *feels*
	faster! I know my HP didn't improve with a shock change but the
	difference in handling really makes the car seem faster. This is
	probably akin to the effect you'd get from changing the throttle
	cam i.e., no real HP difference just an improved "speedier"
	feeling. I had forgotten to mention that I also had a custom
	4 wheel alignment done when I had the shocks changed and
	everything was reset to Porsche factory specs. This is a good
	thing to remember to do after you replace your shocks. The
	cornering is nothing short of *magnifigant*. I suck as a driver
	now. No, I mean I really do. But even I can tell how much better
	the cornering is with my pitiful abilities and how awesome it'd
	be in the hands of a skilled driver. I made a a fairly sharp
	right turn at a signal light (maybe 60 degrees?) at 60 mph with
	my SO in the car...she screamed for about the next 3 blocks...I
	had the biggest grin on my face :) Well, I can see that I haven't
	been very technical again. You can chalk that up to the difference
	new shocks can make on a car with high miles. It makes me very
	emotional. If you got the means to get them, do it. You won't
	regret it!
