I hate to be blunt, but would you use a used helmet? Suits break down and
loose their fire resistance over time. A good new suit may cost $500. You
are MUCH better off spending money on your safety items first, learning how
to race (as opposed to lap) and then spending money on go fast gear for the
car. Unless you have 20 or 30 races under your belt, or are Price Cobb's
twin, I can guarantee you won't be anywhere near the limits for a dead stock
car, much less a prepared one.

Of course, it's a free country, and it's your body.<g>
