Hi All;

Official word on the Road America club race is as follows:

It will be held, same dates and everything.

The race will be limited to 3 run groups, 60 cars per group. Get your
registrations in as early as they are accepted.

We will have paid SCCA corner workers, and we are paying Milwaukee region
SCCA to run the race.

Last years race had a few problems (this is my opinion, and not an official
position except for the part about paddock passes))

1. to many cars, to many run groups, not enough time in the schedule between
sessions. (i.e. NO time)
2. Some ill-advised decisions by our region that irritated the track, and
caused them to wath VERY carefully.
3. People driving street cars into the paddock, and parking anywhere,
including blocking the emergency access roads. This continued all weekend
despite repeated announcements, and is (I think) the straw that broke the
camels back.
4. etc. etc.

This is all being corrected. The limited run groups will take care of number
1, SCCA nmanagement will take care of 2, and 3 will be handled by the simple
implamentation of Paddock passes. 1 pass per race car. These will go on the
tow vehicle/support vehicle. Only cars with a pass will be allowed into the
upper paddock. All other cars must stay below the  Munchworks snack bar.

Additionally, there are some other track rules that people will be getting.
Please follow them, as the Track will in fact throw people out for
violations.  SCCA follows them all the time, and has great race weekends.


All that being said, the race will be great, you'll all have lots of track
time, and you won't get blocked into your paddock spot by some nonthinking
spectator.

Have fun!

Scott Sanda
