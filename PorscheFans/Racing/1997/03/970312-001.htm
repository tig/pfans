Been There and done that so here is what I know.

The Starvation was cured by installing the Welmister sump (about $45) 
which looks like a tin can it fits in where the screen filter is and 
extends the pickup into a cup that holds about 1/2 qt. I also run with an 
extra 1/2 inch of oil on the dip stick.

I mounted the cooler at the rear right, using the mufler braket bolts to 
hang a bar, I dropped the cooler down off that bar and put screen (Heavy 
duty) around it to stop the rocks. And in races I have put that side into 
dirt more than once or twice.

The location is just so-so it keeps the temp down for a while but once it 
gets up there (250-275) it stays there. The air flow is just not good. My 
buddy has a mazda rx7 cooler mounted in the front trunk and popped out 
the cap plugs on the front of the trunk to get air in, and a few holes in 
floor to let it out, and that works great.
