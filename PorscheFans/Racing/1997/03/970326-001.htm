Hi all,

Today I heard the news that Lola has dropped out of F1.  At the first GP of the
year Lola failed to qualify.  Maybe because of F1's new qualifying rule where
the qualifiers need to get within a certain percentage of the Pole sitters time
to qualify.  It seems to me that F1 is destined to become a sanctioned body of
about 3 race teams.  Those race teams being the strongest most well prepared
teams (currently it looks like ferrari, williams, mcclaren, and maybe
benetton).

While teams have dropped in and out of f1 for years, it seems that the rules
and the amounts of money needed to race have forced a lot of people out.

Now to apply that to Porsche racing.  Will club racing become more and more
expensive?  I currently don't have *any* club racing experience.  However I'm
worried that grass roots type racing for the porsche club will become
non-existent.  (I'm not willing to take my car to the local dirt track either,
call me a snob or whatever)

A friend said :

I just read about Lola. So much money, so much work, and they have
to leave after failing to qualify for one race.

I read a few weeks ago how McLaren got started in F1. They rolled
into Casino Square in Monaco with the car on an open trailer behind
a Ford Fairlane station wagon, with no F1 experience.

: end

I really don't want club racing to end up this way...however my fears maybe
unfounded (I hope), and club racing will never acheive the level of commitment
that some other racing series demand.  I'd like club racing to be the type of
racing that the racers commitment is all that is needed, not the series
commitments.
