In my younger days I owned two 914's and experienced just what you have
said. Well, I own the quintessential Porsche now and the 914 is every bit a
Porsche as the 911! Got another surprise for all of you (yes, I'm being
facetious), the VW is just as much a Porsche as the 911 and 914.

Now, the "Boxster" is another matter entirely--talk about a knee-jerk
reaction to the Miata...flame-on!
