Got home about 6:30 from the time trial. We are off to a good season, no
rain dry track on two very minor incidents. I think everyone had a good
time and we set some new track records.  Top time of the day was set by Art
Seeger last run of day as he forgot to post his times. so he was forced to
wait until everyone else had driven. At least he new what time he had to
beat "or maybe that was the plan" Anyway I would like to thank all the
drivers for making the event fun and safe. Next one is in three weeks.
schedule is www.vpm.com/pca-svr/ztimetr.htm
