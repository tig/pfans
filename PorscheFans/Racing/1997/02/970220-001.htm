Hi John,

 I have heard some rumors that the race at Road America may not happen this
 year.  What I heard was a few people had a disagrement with track
 personel, and the Porsche Club may not be allowed to return.  I don't care
 about what happened in the past, and I hope if this is true those people
 are not allowed back to ruin a great weekend for everyone else.  Does
 anyone have the facts on this event.  We have a group of 5-6 cars that may
 make the trek from Orlando to Elkhart Lake, and we need to start making
 plans.  Any information would be of great help.

I hate to do it, but I must tell you that at this point the rumors are true.
 There may not be a Road America Club Race in 1997.  Whether it happens or
not largely depends on how successful the efforts of Chicago Region PCA are
in convincing the RA track management that the problems of last year
(primarily involving paddock control) are not repeated.  Right now RA
management is torqued even more because the event was put on the schedule
before they had even agreed to let Chicago Region have the event there this
year.  I would not want to predict the final outcome at this time, but Club
Racing will let everyone know as soon as possible.  There is a RA
stockholders meeting this weekend which may or may not produce a final
resolution.

Incidently, PCA Club Racing is not the only entity having problems with RA
management.  The Chicago Historics are in somewhat the same situation, at
least as far as Joe Marchetti's involvement is concerned.
