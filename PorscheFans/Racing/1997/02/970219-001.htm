I have an update on my experience with the new Yokohamma A032 race tires
for anyone that cares.

I am running 205/50-15 on a 15x6 front and 225/50-15 on a 15x7 rear on a
73 911 with rather large torsion bars.  Still needs bigger and adjustable
sways.  I used them last October at our Drivers Ed at Roebling Road in
Savannah, and came away with a not so favorable impression.  I spoke to
some people, no one with yokohamma, about what was happening and what they
thought might be the problem.

I started out with the tires at 28psi front and 32psi rear.  I think that
was where I used to run my old 008's, I can't find my old notes anymore. 
The theory we came up with was too much tire pressure.  They would be fine
for a the first 4-5 laps, but would then start losing their grip.  We
thought that as the tires came up to temp, the pressure got too high.  My
co-driver used the car at a drivers ed at Sebring about four weeks ago,
and used lower pressures and he thought the car felt much better.  I ran
the car in the PCA race at Sebring this past weekend, and I used 22 front
and 25 rear, and the car felt great.  I never felt like the tires lost any
grip in the dry sessions.  I was also impressed with the traction in the
wet.
