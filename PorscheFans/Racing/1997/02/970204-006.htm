While I agree that this seems stupid, consider that Porsche brought the
986 to market in a relatively short period of time with a new powerplant
that, to my knowledge, has not seen any service in a real racing 
environment.  The car has recently been launched and is receiving rave 
reviews with sales going strongly and the company is in the middle of a 
rather expensive commercial marketing push.  

Now envision said vehicle parked along the track with oil and 
*water* dripping from its underside in a cloud of smoke.  That's some
pretty expensive advertisement thrown right out the window not to
mention the potentially (likely) negative effect on sales of a product
that Porsche appears to be targeting to a broader demographic audience
than the 911 traditionally has.  My take is that Porsche is playing it
conservative since they would appear have much more to lose if the car 
fails than they stand to win if it does well.  

OTOH, I'm concerned about the potential that there may actually be 
a lack of confidence in the Boxter's ability to stand up to the 
abuse the 911 has always been known for...

P.S. In the waning momements of the race with the Dyson car in for its 
final pit stop, the crew jumps over the wall as the TV cameras zoom in
as the crew chief proceeds to dump two quarts of Red Line synthetic 
into the engine as smoke belches out the filler cap.  The car exits 
the pits and continues on to win the race.  Let's see Prolong top that!

P.P.S  While I'd rather see him driving a car, Jeremy Dale did a 
fantasic job as a commentator on ESPN2 during the 24hrs coverage.  His
insight and attention to detail added a great deal to the coverage.
