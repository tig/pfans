hello,

>    Can anyone tell me if someone is making an aftermarket high performance

I think Autothority makes one, but I'm not really sure.

> experience with the same? I still haven't got a rule book so can anyone tell

> in PCA club race as long as the car makes weight?

Car Classification
  Stock - Classes C thru K
    Any vehicle in the stock classes, including "prepares" vehicles,
must compete with full road equipment and, with the expection of
exhaust/emmisions, be street legal, capable of being registered for
street use in the condition of the car when presented to scrutineering,
and capable of being driven to and from the event.

6. Body/Chassis/Interior
   A. Removal or substition of components, other than those specially
indication below, is not allowed.
   B. Chassis/body, with the expection of bumbers and spoilers, must
be the same material and configuration as supplied by the factory.
   C. Lexan windshields of appropriate thichness and quality of
construction are allowed.
   D. Fuel cells which can be mounted in the location of the stock
gas tank are allowed.
   E. 944 / 968 aluminum A arms may be replaced with an approved replace-
ment unit or appropriately modified early factory steel part.
   F. Seats are free providing minimum weight of vehicle is met.
   G. Steering wheels and shift knobs are free
   H. Spoilers and bumbers/air dams are free providing they do not
exceed maximum factory body length by more than 1 inch, or maximum 
spoiler height of the vehicle by more than 6 inches.
   I. Modifications to the underside of the vehicle for the purpose of
improving aerodynamics are not allowed.
   J. Interiors, wit the exception of seats (which may be replaced,
not removed) and the panels affected by the installation of the roll
bar or roll cage, must be intact.

  "Prepared" Cars
    Any vehicle meeting the criteria for a "stock" Porsche per the
previous rules, and havinh one or more of the following changes will 
progress up one stock class......

6. Body/Chassis/Interior
   A. Duction for additional coolers provided it doesn't change size
or shape of factory panels.
   B. Slope nose conversions are allowed, however tire/wheel require-
ments must remain as per aboce
   C. Fender flaring is allowed.

I take this to mean that if you change the fenders, you move to the
prepared class.

Hope this helped,
