>  We are thinking about doing the Road Atlanta PCA race this coming April
and would be sending our 53' enclosed hauler out there with our car in it
and 3 other cars from the west coast if the interest is there. We would have
room for all spares and gear that someone would typicly take racing. The
transporter will probobly go from Seattle to Los Angeles to Atlanta and
could pick up cars along the way. 
>  This trailer is basicly the same thing as what Kelly Moss has with a
smaller awning but a full airconditioned lounge with shower and reefer and
liftgate with double deck storage for cars.
>  We would also entertain going to any other races that there is enough
interest to fill the trailer with race cars.  Cost is roughly $00.35 per
mile round trip and you have a nice place to pit under an awning with a
reefer full of , uhhhh, beverages ;-) and a place to get out of the sun/rain
whatever. Also a color TV to look at you incar shots after practice. 
>  There is also the possibility of renting a ride in one of the cars going
on the trailer for a person with the right qualifications.
