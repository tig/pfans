The "Jaguar" XJR-14 was designed and built by Tom Walkinshaw Racing and
run in IMSA's GTP series in the late 80s early 90s...

Setting: late summer 1994
- IMSA's WSC class originally did not allow turbo-powered cars.  Porsche
  lobbied IMSA to allow "LeMans Prototype" turbo-powered cars at Daytona
  and Sebring (these cars were already allowed at LeMans).  IMSA finally
  agrees to create another class (WSC-LM), but reserves the right to
  modify the rules at any time.

- Porsche now must build a car on short notice to run in 1995 at
  Daytona/Sebring/LeMans.  Tom Walkinshaw Racing is idle (he hasn't
  yet purchased the Arrows F-1 team...), so Porsche contracts him
  to build a WSC chassis for the 962 engine.  TWR has these chassis
  they ran as Jaguars - make a few modifications, design new
  bodywork and undertray -> new car...

- Meanwhile, the Kremer boys in Koeln notice the rules package will
  allow them to modify one of their K-8s (a 962) to run at Daytona/
  Sebring/LeMans.

January 1995 - Daytona test days
- The TWR-Porsche runs pretty quickly (within a couple seconds per lap
  of the Ferrari 333SP).  IMSA wonders: "Are they sandbagging?  Just
  to make sure, the WSC-LM cars must run with *still smaller* restrictor
  plates during the race."  They announce this rule change about 10 days
  before the race.

- Porsche does some quick calculating and figures the smaller intakes
  will cost ~4 seconds per lap.  Not content with only class wins, Porsche
  withdraws the TWR-Porsche WSC-LM cars, and encourages other competitors
  in the same position (the Kremer K-8) to do so also.  The Kremer team
  ignores this advice and decides to run at Daytona anyway.  Porsche decides
  further development is too expensive just for LeMans, so the cars are put
  in the museum.

February 1995 - Rolex 24 at Daytona
- Ferraris rocket off into the distance at the start.  Dyson's Ford R&S
  (the only car as quick as the Ferraris) blows an engine after 30 minutes.
  The Kremer K-8 trundles slowly around the track. [fade to sunrise]  The
  Kremer K-8 still trundles around the track while the Ferrari mechanics
  continually *try* to pushstart the 333SP on pit-road.  The Kremer K-8 wins.

January 1996
- Porsche is heavily involved in the GT-1 project.  Reinhold Joest (a longtime
  Porsche racing customer) asks if he can run the TWR-Porsche at LeMans.
  Porsche agrees to let them campaign the cars.
