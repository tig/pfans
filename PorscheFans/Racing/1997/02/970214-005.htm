>If you are looking for a small enclosed rig with tractor....There is a
>26'? trailer with tractor cab specialty built by Grumman for the Snack
>Food Industry. It has about 18' before the step up at the 5th wheel with
>no wheel well intrusion. It is located in Waterloo, Iowa. It is very
>nicely done, well built and has some nice features for car applications.
>It is white with horizontal stripes. The "Eagle Snacks" signage has been
>removed. About 50K miles on the tractor which is nicely skirted in
>aluminum and it has an efi v-8 gas engine. The tractor wouldn't be
>offensive to drive around, by itself, as a second or third vehicle. I
>think the asking price is about 20K...negotiable, I'm sure.
>
>The fleet managers for commercial trucks are usually very demanding and
>it doesnt get much better than Grumman, IMHO.

>I spotted this accidently....if I had a business application that I
>could dual purpose this rig, I would be interested. We have a
>TR4...anything this size and smaller seems to be a good fit.

>Three of these things were bought on spec by a local dealer. One is
>left. Contact: Clay Skinner @ 319.233.3341 (Bill Colwell's Auto-Mart.
>(Usual disclaimers)  If anyone has any questions from me, I would be
>happy to try to answer them.
