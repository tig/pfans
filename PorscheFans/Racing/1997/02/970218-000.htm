I'm not sure if this is correct. There is some conflicting information.
The rule book I have states:

1. Engine
   G. Air condition BELTS (my capitals for emphasis) and air injections 
systems may be removed.

6. Body/Chassis/Interior
   A. Removal or substitution of components, other than those specifically
indicated below, is not allowed.
   B. Chassis/body, with the exception of bumpers and spoilers, must be
the same material and configuration as supplied by the factory.
   J. Interiors, with the exception of seats (which may be replaced,
not removed) and the panels affected by the installation of the roll
bat or roll cage, must remain intact.

I take this to mean that if your car came with A/C, you have to race
with A/C. Anyone have other information (not that I am going to
remove the A/C on my car)?
