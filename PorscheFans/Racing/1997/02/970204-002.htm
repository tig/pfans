Hi All,
        On Feb3 R.L. Mitchell asked some good questions re. Club Racing
rules raised by the Article in the current Excellence.
1. As far as removing air conditioning components I am copying e-mail I
just received from Harry Hall (Chief technical guy for club racing) on this
subject:

"From: Harrison Hall <hhall@UDel.Edu>
To: Lance Flynn <71137.1777@compuserve.com>

If all US 944 Turbos came with air and it could not be simply option
deleted by checking a box on the order form, then (as with US 3.2
Carreras) it must be left on the car.  This goes for compressor,
condenser, lines, etc.  The only removable component would be the belt.
Everything else must be there though we don't require that it be
functional.

Cars have been disqualified for lack of major A/C components.

Harry"

2.  re. putting turbo nose on earlier 944.  To me this would be a stretch
of the rules.  Bumper material is free, but to completely change the design
might be too much for the scrutineers.

3. Can't comment on the wheels.

4.  I too am curious as to whether or not camber plates are legal for 944s
in stock.  Who can help on this point. Monte?
