Haven't gotten my issue yet but is this an article by David Colman about the 
Sears Point Race? 
 
Can't help with the rims question, haven't seen the pix.  The 87 rims will fit 
though.  Only the TurboS rims and S2(?) rims from the big brake cars are 
different. 
 
Yes, you can remove the a/c, but you need to make a minimum overall weight.  I 
think you can update the bodywork without penalty.   
 
The camber plates are legal in stock class as they have been determined to 
give no advantage.  Consensus was that you could acheive "optimum" camber with 
the stock setup, therefore there was no advantage to having the plates.
