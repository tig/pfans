Not in the rulebook Mike, got this form Harry Hall when I checked into 
competitors running them......There are apparently exceptions to the rules 
that are made arbitrairily and not published.  Neat, huh?(sarcasm intended)

 Which INHO is a crock! The ability to quickly change suspension setups
 quickly for a given track, weather condition, or drivers preference, 
  is a huge advantage. It is also very difficult, in most 944's, to get much
 more than 2 degrees negative camber without modifications. It is rules like
 there, in stock classes, that really get me torqued up!

I agree with Jerry.

Ted, where do you see that they are legal in the rulebook?
All I can find is that suspension mounting points may not
be modified. This means that plates are illegal as they
change the geometry. If they have been determined legal
by consensus then that should appear in the book.
At least that's how it should work IMHO.
