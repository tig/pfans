   The way it works Barry is as follows: If your car was offered from the
factory in a certain configuration then it is legal for you to bring your
car to that configuration. IE: if you 944 was ever offered without A/C then
it is ok to remove the A/C. An RSA may run in class F if it makes C2 weight.
A C2 may run in class D and be as light as a RSA (good luck);-) A 944S2 may
be run as an MO30 car with 10" rears and 8.5" front wheels if you choose to
call it an MO30 car.

 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
