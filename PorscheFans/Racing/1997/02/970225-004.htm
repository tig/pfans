Well, if you talk to 10 different people who are racing these cars you'll get 
12 different opinions on this.  Here's mine: 
 
I run an 83 944 with an 84 motor and an 87 or later oil pan and baffle system. 
 I've a remote oil cooler(turbo type mod). The key to the success of this 
system is that you run the oil level 1/8" over full on the dipstick. And, you 
MUST check it religiously!!!!!! After every session!!!! 
 
I ran 5 races and 7 time trials last year and changed bearings this winter.  
No discernable wear. 
 
Now, there is a theory that the later motors have a higher volume oil pump and 
will scavange so much oil that they'll suck and pump air and you'll ruin #2.   
I have no experience with the later pump.  If you believe that theory, get an 
early pump and use the late pan. 
 
Know of two cars that fried bearings last year, both were down a bit on oil. 
 
Hope this helps, 
 
 
Ted

Has anyone put together some information on modifications required to keep
the 944T from blowing up at the track?  I know they have rod bearing
problems caused by oil starvation, weak oil coolers and various less
catastrophic problems, but is there a preferred fix for these things?  I'm
hoping to get another 944T to do some part time PCA events, but I want to
keep it in one piece.  Thanks.
