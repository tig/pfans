What's the straight skinny on Snell rating for helmets for 1997 PCA Club
Racing? Some here in Central Indiana think Snell 90 is ok, some (Jim
Brillhard) "saw something somewhere" that indicated as of Sebring we go
to S95??????

Just got back from Daytona. Hung out with #98, the Larry Schumacher car,
which came in 4th in GT2. By now the papers etc should have picked up
placements etc. I'll try to answer any questions. Speedvision also has a
pretty good page on IMSA, as does www.starnews.com.

One thing I saw that ticked me off was the Saleen Mustangs (in the pit
next to us) pull out with two laps to go (Tim Allen in one), right in
front of the #3 Ferrari, slowing it down considerably, all for photos.
As a side light also, #22, A camero shared the pit with Larry's crew.
The camero's crew chief asked one of Larry's crew what a yellow flag
with red stripes meant! 103 Exxon was going for $4.50 per gal. Good
weather after the race started, in the mid 70s, sun, wiggles and
giggles. #46, the Lester Jag ran REALLY strong, leading GT1 until the
end, than faded. The GT2 car, #99, that was the Porsche across the
finish line had a female driver. The NASCAR thing was less than a laugh;
it had trouble keeping up with the pace car and luckily went out after
about 5 hours.
