I have the Cool Carbon B2 compound on my 911SC too.  I have two track events
and maybe 500 street miles on them, and I have not had the buildup problem.  On
the other hand, these were my first two track events, and I may not be going
fast enough and braking hard enough to cause it.

The cure is apparently to take some sandpaper to your rotors to get the buildup
off.  Someone on Porschefans told me that if this happens I should call Cool
Carbon, who might offer me a set of the old compound pads in exchange.  The
email went on to say that maybe the B2 compound was not adequately tested
before release, and that there would be a B3 compound out to replace the B2.
This was in September.

Hope this helps.
