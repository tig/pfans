I agree with Amit, the choice for 911 vs 944 as a track car is a dilema.  I
have had both and will throw in my comments.  I drove my 83 944 for about
six years before my first Driver's Ed event.  I could not believe how well
the 944 handled.  I drove an additional 8 to 10 events with the 944 and
really liked it, except for the lack of horsepower (147).  I spent the
winter shopping for a faster car and bought an 84 911 Euro (231 hp).
Everyone said that it would be tail happy so I was quite nervous about it.
After a couple of days on the track, I commented to someone that it was no
where near as tail happy as I had heard.  There comment "you're not going
fast enough".  well, I have about 20 track days in the 911 and it is tail
happy, and I really love it.  Driving a 911 at or near it's limits is a real
experience and I think adds to the thrill (when it's under control).  I'sure
the 944 guys think race cars should be well balanced front to rear, but 911
guys/girls really enjoy the thrill of a corner done fast with your butt
hanging way out there.  My advice is to get enough horsepower with either an
911SC or 944S2.  Both are excellent cars, but horespower costs way too much
to add later, you'll want it!
