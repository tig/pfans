Guys,

The Sebring PCA Club Race was one of the most enjoyable events I've ever
attended.  Charlie Morganthaler and Jim Hayes organized an incredible three
day race weekend with lots of social doings and everything went off without a
hitch.  Corner workers were good, grid people were organized, timing/scoring
was incredible and the feeling of comradeship was every where.

The weather went from cloudy to damp to wet to damp but it didn't seem to
affect those in attendance.  And, better still, even with those kind of track
conditions the number of incidents were less than would be expected.  Three
incidents with mostly modest body damage.

Of the 197 people who raced at the event, eighteen were first time rookies
and thirteen were first time PCA club racers; that's thirty-one new people.
 If anyone is wondering if the program is healthy, that should be an
indication.

On Saturday, during a practice session we threw the black flag at Tony Murphy
who acknowledged the flag and came into the pits.  When she arrived, Harry
Hall, chief scrutineer, told her to cut her engine and remove her helmet.
 Then Tom McGlynn appeared from behind the wall, went to bended knee (how
else do you talk to someone in a race car) and proposed.  He soon stood with
thumbs up - she had accepted.  There are rumors that the wedding might take
place at the Brainerd race this summer.  How's that for a race weekend.

Qualifying sessions were damp to wet and many decided not to run.  By race
time it was mostly damp with a couple of puddles in strategic places.  Still,
in every run group there was a great deal of close racing and many finishes
were decided on the last lap.  Racers who finished ahead of the competition
in their respective classes are:

GT1R - Mike Schrom 2:22.949
GT1S - Julian Allan 2:50.121
GT2R - Peter Kitchak 2:32.958
GT2S - Jeremiah Kelly 2:43.073
GT3R - Jim Scott 2:45.506
GT3S - George Balbach 2:48.256
GT4R - Tom King 3:12.576
GT4S - Brian Canfield 2:58.381
GT5R - Kevin Wheeler 3:14.202
GT5S - Mark Eskuche 2:57.194
GT6S - Paul Swanson 3:13.315
C - Grady Willingham 2:58.999
D - William Toonen 2:53.452
E - Chris Musante 2:47.731
F - Ross Bleustein 3:08.240
G - Erik Johnson 3:16.356
H - John Crosby 3:05.558
I - Ty Hamill 3:03.298
J - Nancy Lowe 3:29.867
K - Steve Gaglione 3:25.197

In PCA Club Racing we define winning as doing the very best you can and
having fun while doing it and at Sebring 1997 we had at least 197 real
winners.  You should have been there!  Oh, and Vince, we missed you - what
happened?
