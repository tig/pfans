Well the race ended a couple hours ago and I'm back in the hotel. Sorry I
couldn't provide updates but you guys had the TV coverage and we didn't!
(Except for the hour we sneaked into the VIP suites.) I hope the Deuce
covered it adequately. I'll find out when I get back to the VCR.

Our car, the white #69 driven by Tim Ralston, Jeff Gamroth, Monte Shelton
and Jorge Trejos finished 4th in GTS-3 and we think we were 11th or 12th
overall. That's after starting 19th in class and 60th overall. We ran for 4
hours in 2nd place but the long hours of the night added seconds to our
laps.

This place is a race fan's heaven and a PorscheFans delight.

I've never seen so many beautifully prepared entries. 99 cars were present
for qualifying all hoping for one of the 80 spots on the starting grid.
This was the largest turnout ever for this event.

Our entry, a freshly delivered RSR, was prepared mainly by Jeff Gamroth. He
poured his heart and soul into both the preparation and his driving. Jeff
and teammate Jorge Trejos both ran laps routinely at 2:01 during the race.
They share the same aggressive driving style, wonderful to watch.

Only two bits of drama: Jeff hit some oil at 150 mph and mowed the lawn for
about 200 yards. No damage but the pristine white 911 picked up some grass
stains and shed some carbon-kevlar. Later a stud holding the alternator
gave way and required an 8 minute repair. The last 1.5 hours were run at
moderated speed to accommodate the temporary repair.

One other item, 64 year old team driver, Monte Shelton, was an absolute
rock: At one point yellow flags messed up our driver rotation schedule
leaving Monte in the car for well over the normal 1.5 hour shift. He not
only performed flawlessly for his extended tour of duty but he gained
several positions, emerged with a smile and looked ready to drive another
hour. What an inspiration.

The team's goals for their first effort were to have fun and finish the
race. To come so near the podium on the first time out was never thought
possible.

I have a hunch this car will be back here next year.
