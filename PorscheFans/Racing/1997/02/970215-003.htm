PFans:

I am about to purchase a set of 17" wheels (too hard to find a wide range of 
18" tires sizes) and DOT track tires (Hoosier or BFG) for my RS America.  I 
autocross and run drivers ed events.  I want to buy the widest rim/tire 
combination that will not require any alteration of the wheel well and/or 
fender lip.  I will be lowering the car about an inch with Eibach springs 
prior to the wheel/tire purchase.

Like everything else, there are rumors galore as to what are the max. sizes I 
can run.  The RS America came stock with 7J front and 8J rims in back with 
205x50ZR17 and 255x40ZR17 tires, respectively.

Dealing with the front tires first, I am told I can run Hoosier 245x40ZR17 
(their smallest 17" tire) or BFG R1 245x45ZR17 on the track but they will rub 
when the wheels are at or near right or left lock.  The next size down is 
BFG's 235x45ZR17.  Will these not rub?

Now for the rear.  I thought I heard you can run 315x35ZR17 or is 275x40ZR17 
the limit?

The best bang-for the-buck seems to be the one piece Borbet C2T wheels which 
are 7.5x17 and 9x17.  The spec. sheet I have says I can put BFG's 235x45ZR17 
or 245x45ZR17on a 7.5 to 9" rim (Borbet's 7.5" in the front) and 275x40ZR17 on 
an 8.5 - 10" rim (Borbet's 9" in the rear).  The BFG 315x35ZR17 needs a 10" 
rim.  Accordingly, Hoosier's spec. sheet says their tires need to run on 8.5" 
and 9.5" rims, respectively.  The only wider rims I can find are 3-piece and 
this doubles the price for wheels. Are my findings sound? 

I would appreciate anyone commenting if they have hands-on experience with a 
C2/RS America.  Please, no more I heard you can .... because I have probably 
heard it, too.

Thanks,

Bob
