Don't know but I believe they will be offset to the inside too much.

I always wanted to run in "I-stock" ;-)

>  Q: Is it legal to remove the Air Conditioning as described on page 104?

The rulebook says the belts may be removed. If AC was optional
(I think it was on the 924S, at least the 88) then you can remove it.
I don't know if all 944s came with AC standard.

>  Q: Can a Turbo nose (as shown in the pictures) be legally fitted?

Yes, bumpers are free in stock class. Weight must be met however.

No, must use stock locations with no machining.

>  '88 924S w/M030

For solo-II the 924S (especially '88 M030 version)
has an advantage over the 944, but for club racing I think
the 944 has the advantage of bigger wheels and tires, 
wider track, and not much more weight.
