   I don't have a rule book but was wondering where this car fits into PCA
club racing class and what size wheels are allowed on it? What size wheels
are allowed if it gets bumped a class for a wing?

Lemmy no,

 BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
 or  a buncha other stuff important to me that makes some little people get
 upset when I put it in my signiture file........ well, it just couldn't be
 that important, now could it? ;-) white)
