FWIW, I used first the Blue and more recently the B2 Cool Carbon compound with
excellent results on my '88 951. But I've also heard of some funny problems
with the B2 formula pads from the shop where I buy them.

I called the shop yesterday and was told that the phone and fax at CC are
disconnected. I was also told that a company named Power Pad was the
original manufacturer of the CC pads and would be "taking over production"
of the original compound pads. So the originals should be in supply in the
near
future.
