Hi

I had my travel agent check for lodging last week near Sebring.  Not a room
within 50 miles.  Luckily I was staying only 60 miles away so I'm going to
commute.  Received my race tickets in the mail today and am excited.
sitting here in Maine, 20 degrees, freezing rain and both Porsches put away
from Nov to April 1.  Watching Daytona 24 hrs again.  

I'd like to meet others on the list Saturday at the event, someone needs to
set it up, I have not been there before.
