A few threads ago, one PF reader requested info regarding 993 chips. Herewith
entombed is my personal experience FWIW (for what its worth). (Warning: I
neither sell chips, nor write programs for such).
The Short Answer is NO. There are no discernably operable aftermarket chips
for the 993 - particularly for the VarioRam 3.6. Many claims are out there
for such (most with severe limitations such as "this 993 chip will not work
in most 993's").

History: There are plenty of adequate chips for the 3.2 911 Carrera, and the
3.6 964 Carrera. Because the early 993 ('95 and very early '96) used a
pre-VarioRam induction system, some small gains may be available by chips. 
My '93 RSA responded very well to aftermarket chips offerd by E.Paul
Dickinson of Sewickly Porsche, who curved a chip for his killer RSA times at
the Cincinnati Parade. I used his chip for about 10 events and found the car
to be substantially more responsive. BUT, the chip was "curved" for a box
stock RSA. Mine had A/C (a necessary and welcome compromise while waiting for
your run group's turn in Florida). After adding a lightened flywheel, K & N
air filter, and a U-tube to replace the factory resonator, the car was
awesome - but wouldn't stay lit. The drag of the A/C was too much for the
lightened flywheel to handle, even when not in operation. 
The fix was a one-off custom chip from Autothority. My "specifications" were
to bring on the onset of the idle circuits a little sooner on rev-down, and
do not raise the stock rev limit. This was achieved and the car ran merrily
after that, even on max A/C. Unfortunately, AT changed hands shortly after
they did my chip, and fellow PCA'ers trying to get the same results from AT
have been stallingly unsuccessful. 
WARNING: Most Chip makers for normally aspirated engines get their numbers by
simply increasing the rev limiter a few extra hundred RPM. The factory set
that limit for longevity of the engine. There are VOLUMES of data and sad
stories about the 3.2 and 3.6 engines not being able to withstand lengthy
abuse at near-factory red line. Thus, one should look to the TORQUE end of
the spectrum for gains and faster out-of-the-corners times for these engines
unless you are entering a car at the Daytona 24, Sebring 12, or Le Mans where
a substantial amount of time is spent at Warp 10.

For VarioRam engines I suggest the following. Order the factory Motor Sound
Package and buy a K & N airfilter from Andial. The Motor Sound Package as an
option is under $400. As an After Market replacement it is over $2k. The
sound part is excellent, but more importantly, you get about 15 more HP AND
lose about 8 Lbs. The factory, not wanting to recertify its 993 with a "Sport
Exhaust System", makes no official claims for performance enhancement in
order to avoid such red tape. To achieve the "sound" there are fewer baffles
in the mufflers (i.e. less back pressure, less metal weight). The Motor Sound
Package also includes a very low restriction INTAKE box (all kinds of extra
holes for air to enter) in addition to the shiny opening. More air is more
POWER to the VarioRam! Also 100+ lead free gas (available at most rrack
events) is a welcome guest to a system with a Smart CHip, knock-sensing.
timing advancement system. Just Pour and Win!
Skip the Chips. Go for more air, better combustion, faster exhausting. Chips
are for kids (and Turbo's wishing to become hand grenades).
