This one is easier than your last question. If it's a '95
then Class E. One inch wider than stock means 8" and 10" rims 
of any diameter 15"+  would be legal. No wing as they were 
not available in '95 I think.

A '96+ 993 is in class D, and since the 8s and 10s by 18" were
optional you can run 9s and 11s! Also the C2 had an optional "aero" 
package so you could use THAT 993 C2 wing and still run in D.
I've never seen a 993 C2 wing, it may be just a tail like the turbo
instead of the wing used on the C4S aero.

Of course you can add a wing to either 993 C2 and 1" wider yet 
tires and move up a group.
