Guys,

Some interesting background:  Mike Doolin, Scott Peeler, Franz Blaum, Dave
White and Kelly-Moss had all lobbied IMSA to permit the Boxster to run in
Sports Class in the Endurance series for 1997.  IMSA agreed and informed
everyone that the car had been accepted.  The cars were suppose to be
delivered before the practice days at Daytona.  Meanwhile, with teutonic
reasoning, Porsche had decreed that the Boxster would not be raced in 1997
and Porsche Motorsports started working IMSA (Doug Matthews) and making phone
calls to insure that cars would not be delivered where they might be raced.
 The cars were not delivered for Daytona practice and two days later everyone
received letters saying that IMSA had changed their collective mind and the
Boxster would not be approved to run in the series "for at least nine
months."

Doolin/Peeler and Franz Blaum immediately phoned BMW to see what was going on
with their racing program.  Subsequently they purchased two 328si cars to run
in the Sports class.  According to Doolin they have received more
help/assistance/support/encouragement in two weeks than he and I received in
three years with the 968 - that BMW is aggressive and supportive and has
decided that they will win the marque trophies for the Endurance series
Sports class and in GTS-3.  Of interest is that BMW will match any prize
money received from IMSA, etc.  If you run a Porsche you get to buy parts at
retail plus shipping, etc.

Anyway, with partially prepared cars, Blaum finished second and Doolin/Peeler
third in the Sports class at the Daytona Endurance race and, with the BMW
contribution to winnings, actually made money on the race.  Four heretofore
loyal Porsche driver/owners are now helping BMW to fame and sales.  The
Boxsters have been sold.  Interesting?  What's the german word for stupid . .
.. or, arrogant?
