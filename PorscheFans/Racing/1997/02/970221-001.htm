I hate to say this, but things like this have been happening more and more
lately. PCA is getting a really bad reputation. As much as I love my car, and
enjoy being in PCA, a lot of PCA members are just downright rude. None of our
local clubs, including SCCA want anything to do with my region anymore, due to
a lot of ignorant, uninformed comments by PCA members. I have had fellow PCA
members make such rude comments about my car that I have considered not
renewing my membership.( a 914 isn't a real Porsche/oh look, a Volkswagen! )
Please think before making a comment about anyone's car, Porsche or not. You
can talk about my husband, but please, not my car!! Let's make an effort to
have a club we can be proud of, not an embarrassment.
