I'm vascillating between buying a 85.5-89 944 (not a 951) or a 78-80
911SC. The idea is to set the car up for track use while using it as a
daily driver, and to eventually (in about 3 years, when I hope to have
a few more bucks) go club racing. The 944s are tempting since the
initial cost is lower ($6-10K) than the 911 ($12-15K), but I really
would much rather have a 911 (no offense to owners of the water-cooled
cars, but I've been in love with the 911 since I first laid my eyes on
one -- just haven't owned one yet due to the better performance offered
by Japanese sports cars for the same money).  While I have a pretty
good idea about the perfomance of each, I've only driven both for short
periods of time on test drives, and therefore am a little uncertain
about the suitability for track use.  Also, cost and ease of
maintenance (under hard driving conditions) would be a concern. Would a
944 stand up better to the abuse since it's likely to be 7-8 years
newer, or is a 911 so much better put together (remember we're talking
about an SC here, not a 993) that it would be more trouble free. (I've
heard of the 911's being a lot more solid, and about the water-pumpers
being a maintenance nightmare.) Also, if I look for a 944, it it worth
the extra bucks to get an S or S2? As far as track experience is
concerned...  currently limited to 2 track events last year. I really
don't have a problem with getting a slower car since it's less likely
to overwhelm me at the track and would probably better to learn in. Of
course, I'd like something I won't outgrow too soon. (Boy, am I having
a hard time making up my mind! :)

I really don't have a strict budget, but the idea would be to spend the
least possible now and have more $$$ available for track time and
maintenance/upgrades. The only other consideration is that I would like
to lower my insurance payments somewhat (currently driving a '93 RX-7-TT).
After my latest escapade with the cops (still in court over it), my
insurance, while already high due to a less than perfect driving record,
is likely to really get up there.

Thanks in advance for your opinions.

Amit
