I did not get the digest that this message should have been posted to,
so I am not sure if it ever went out.  If you already got this, I'm
sorry for the duplication

I have an update on my experience with the new Yokohama A032 race
tires.

=46irst a little background.  I am running 205/50-15 on a 15x6 front and
225/50-15 on a 15x7 rear on a 73 911 with rather large torsion bars.
I started out with the tires at 28psi front and 32psi rear.  I think
that was where I used to run my old 008's, I can't find my old notes
anymore to confirm that.  I first used them last October at our
Drivers Ed at Roebling Road in Savannah, and came away with a not so
favorable impression.  I spoke to some local friends, about what was
happening and what they thought might be the problem.

The theory we came up with was too high starting tire pressure.  They
would be fine for a the first 4-5 laps, but would then start losing
their grip.  We thought that as the tires came up to temp, the
pressure got too high.  My co-driver used the car at a couple of
drivers ed events at Sebring, and he dropped the starting pressures a
little each weekend and he thought the car felt better each time.  I
ran the car in the PCA race at Sebring, and I used 22 front and 25
rear, and the car felt great.  I never felt like the tires lost any
grip in the dry sessions.  I was also impressed with the traction in
the wet.
