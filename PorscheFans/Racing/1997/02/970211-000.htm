Hello,

I see a discrepancy in the wording of 3F in the stock tires/wheels
rules. I don't mean to be picky but I have been working with 
SCCA and PCA rules for a long time and usually understand them.

First it says that the tires must be within 3% of stock
rolling radius which I have always understood. This was enough
in the past but some people could not do the math I guess.

Now there is a NOTE that says that "ANY tire with a
section width of 185 or more and aspect ration of 35 or higher
and 15" or more diamater" may be used with the
following exceptions (195, and 205, and 225/50/15)
on the drive wheels.

These exceptions are not a discrepancy as these are more than
3% smaller than stock, but there are other sizes not listed that
are also more than 3% less (i.e. 225/45/15 Hoosiers).

1. So which rule applies to these 225/45/15 tires : are they 
illegal because they are out of the 3% range, or legal because
they meet the  "any tire ... except" rule? What about 245/50/15,
do I need to measure them or are they OK as they are not on
the exclusion list?

2. Are any tire sizes allowed on the non-drive wheels?

Thank you for your clarification.

P.S. now that the PCR's will probably throw out the
minimum diameter rule, maybe club racing can do the same
next year. It does not make sense to me to allow 235/45/17 tires
on an early 911 but not 205 or 225/50/15s. The 17s are faster and
many times more expensive for the wheel/tire combo (especially
since many people already have 15" or 16" wheels that they could use).
