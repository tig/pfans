Hey guys,

With all the discussion about brake pads, I'm curious to know why no one
is using Porterfield pads?  In my Talon, I used the R4-S compound for street
and for light track duty.  I had purchased their R4 race pad for the track,
but I couldn't get the R4-S to fade, even after 20-30 laps.  Our track is
very hard on brakes, you go from 200km/h down to a 40km/h hairpin.  The only
bad things I noticed were that they dusted *A LOT*, made noise sometimes,
and grooved the rotors under extreme use.

It's unusual because I started using the Porterfield pads after the local
PCA guys recommended them to me when I owned my Talon, but now I don't
hear anyone talk about them anymore.  The Talon was a 3400lb car and only
had 11" rotors and dual piston calipers so pad and rotor selection was
critical.  I also used Porterfield's heat treated rotors which would not
warp no matter what I did.  The stock brakes could be warped within 
4 laps!
