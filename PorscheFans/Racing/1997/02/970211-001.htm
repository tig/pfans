Racers,

I first want to thank everyone who responded to my inquiry regarding the
proposed 1998 Club Race in Steamboat Springs.  The responses ran about 2 to 1
in favor of the street race.
I have at this point bad news for those of you who were enthused about it.
 The PCA National insurance broker has decided PCA is not in the business of
putting on street races.  The issue, if not dead, is at least on hold.  We
are going to explore other avenues, but at this point, things don't look
good.
I will keep everyone informed of any progress through this forum.

Regards,

Pat Moyle (pm9146@aol.com)
