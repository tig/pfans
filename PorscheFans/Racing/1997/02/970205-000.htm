Hi All

The following article appeared in the UK Daily Telegraph last July.  I saved
it at the time, and just re-read it, during an e-mail mailbox clear out!

Thought you might enjoy [even if it is in UK English - translations available!!]

>Spin doctors who can't be wrong
>
>By Sarah Edworthy
>
>YOU are whizzing down the back straight. About to clock a fantastic lap
>time. Just three more corners to negotiate. Aaaaaargh! You mistime the
>hairpin, lock up, spin, bounce off the tyres and stall the engine. Right in
>front of banks of spectators. What do you do?
>
>Rule No 1. Immediately create the suspicion of a mechanical gremlin.
>Remember, at this level there is no such thing as driver error.
>
>Hoist yourself out of the cockpit and walk a few feet away. Turn back to
>stare at your car (while undoing the helmet's chin-strap) as if to say "Now
>look what you've gone and done". Pretend you've noticed something. Walk back
>to car, examine suspect area closely, and walk away shaking your head as
>officials run to assist you.
>
>Your team, watching in the pits, were banking on a good performance. They
>know you've blown it with a misjudgment, a tiny lapse of concentration. But
>what do you say to the outside world?
>
>Rule No 2. Underplay it. Refer to "a bit of a moment", not a crash.
>"Somebody dropped some oil", is a good line. "The car went away from me and
>then I was just a passenger . . . I'm very dis- appointed because if you
>look at my sector times up until then, I would have been on pole."
>
>Rule No 3. If this does not convince, turn philosophical. "But that's motor
>racing," you say with a superior shrug, confident that the world divides
>between those who were in the cockpit (you alone) and those who were not
>(the rest of the world).
>
>A day spent testing a variety of cars at Jonathan Palmer's Motorsport
>Experience gives one an insight into what it feels like to be part of a
>grand prix team - and not just the exhilaration of driving a single-seater
>inches above the ground, of powersliding around corners, of learning how to
>control a skid or struggling with a wheel nut in a mock pit stop.
>
>As part of a team accumulating points over an eight-hour programme of
>high-performance driving activities, the skill acquired most easily is the
>art of making excuses. You realise there is no such thing as a whingeing
>driver, just genuine embarrassment at handicapping a team effort.
>
>As we will doubtless see over the next three days at Silverstone, there is
>often, of course, a mechanical explanation for a retirement or a Did Not
>Finish. The trick is to talk through the spin, for instance, without saying
>why you went into one. The driver is responsible for the glory, the car or
>circuit or another driver for any problems. It is as simple as that.
>
>* Here follows a rough guide to what team and driver-speak really means:
>
>Understeer and oversteer - very popular during qualifying. According to
>David Coulthard's race engineer, David Brown, understeer is where you hit
>the wall with the front of the car and oversteer is where you hit it with
>the back.
>
>A bit of a moment - said with maximum understatement. Invariably a solo
>effort, which leaves a lot of black lines over the circuit, probably a spin
>of 180 degrees. Also used for unscheduled grass-trimming, gravel-skating
>excursions and near collisions.
>
>A bit of an incident - said with sheepish understatement. More serious than
>a "moment", involving something solid.
>
>For sure - useful phrase with which to begin sentences, as in: "For sure it
>was going to be my fastest lap but . . . " Employed by foreign drivers to:
>a) suggest they are fluent in colloquial English, or b) stall for time,
>while they summon up some more excuses, sorry, words in English.
>
>Employed by English-speaking drivers to admonish interrogator, as in: "For
>sure it was the end of my race but . . . " where the phrase "I don't need to
>be reminded of that, you b******" is understood.
>
>It's actually very difficult to explain . . . - followed by a long-winded,
>technical, shaggy dog story, with explanatory gesticulation, to justify a
>crash into a pit-lane wall when coming in for a fuel stop or spin on the
>warm-up lap.
>
>Doing a Top Gun - Johnny Herbert's description of Martin Brundle flying
>upside down above him in Melbourne.
>
>We/our - as used by Jacques Villeneuve. Grammatical ploy to differentiate
>driver/mechanical responsibility. This tends to go something like: "I was
>running a strong second and then the car got a bit sideways. It went up on
>the grass and that was the end of our race."
>
>Too much wheelspin - a bad start.
>
>A rogue mechanic working under his own steam - team member responsible for
>the part found to infringe regulations.
>
>A junior employee - ditto.
>
>Problems with the chickens - exclusive to Gerhard Berger. His pronunciation
>of chicanes.
>
>The car was perfect - rare expression, used only by winner.
>
>I was surprised to win because I was stuck in fifth gear - I am brilliant.
>
>It was good for the team that I finished fourth, ahead of my team-mate,
>especially because I lost first and second gear - I am much better than my
>team-mate.
>
>Couldn't get the set-up right - I don't understand my car.
>
>My next set of tyres altered the balance and I lost time in the final run .
>. . " - I realised I wasn't going to finish in the points so just decided to
>take it easy.
