Hi all,
	
	Thank you all for your great responses to my post. But I guess I wasn't
clear enough in my question. I know that Dzus fasteners are usable on
body work, I've seen them in use everywhere. What I really would like to
know is what size/style I should be looking at, they have a big variety
available.

	Walt mentioned that Pegasus has a big section on that, so I will be
checking it out. I guess I never really noticed that section before as
it didn't concern me then. Now it does...

Thanks again for all your help, any and all suggestions are welcome...

Hmm, this begs a question though. Would mounting an aftermarket spoiler
to the front of a car with Dzus fasteners be legal in Street Prepared? I
can't see why not. Any coments before I go out and spend more money?
