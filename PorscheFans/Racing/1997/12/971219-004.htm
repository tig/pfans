Brad - you use an SO's e-mail?  Anyway, buy Nuts, Bolts, and Fasteners
by Carrol Smith (it's in lots of the catalogs), politely known as Screw to
Win.  He has a good explanation of what fastener torque is really all
about (clamping force developed by stretching the male fastener as the
female rotates (if a nut), etc).  Torque readings are a way of
approximating what fastener stretch has been achieved.  Lubrication
gives you more stretch at the same torque reading, but you need (or
desire) to know if the manufacturer has specified the torque with or
without lubrication, and perhaps what type of lubrication.  In my
experience, only the nut and bolt companies really tell you all about this,
and automobile manufacturers just give you a big list of torques, so doing
the right thing in practice may be harder than the theory.  

You need some stretch, but if you get too much things break.  Some
fasteners (like con rod bolts) are more critical because of high forces
and the need for low weight.  Case through bolts or bearing caps and
head studs would be right up there next in line.  Really gives you a pretty
good idea of what this is all about.

When I have time I'll take a look at what I have stored to see if I can give
you a date, but Smith's book is as good as what you will find on the list. 
Also some engineer type sent me a long post he had done on the subject
for the unwashed.  Maybe he'll read this and favor you with it also, or I'll
see where I saved it and pass it along.
