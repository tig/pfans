Bill Betts inquired:


The second is a question that came to mind while reading all the questions &
answers about PCA Club rules.  I have a 1967 911 running with a stock 1969 S
motor.  The interior has been stripped to bare (rusty) metal and all side
windows and frames removed.  A roll cage has been bolted/welded in and I
have a plastic racing seat with a five point harness.  The ignition system
will be a MDS by spring.  The oil system will be  modified as well by then
to eliminate cavitation (don't want to burn out a second motor).  The
flywheel is lightened and the torsion bars and sway bars have been beefed up
and the car lowered.  

I've finally reached the point where I cannot spend any more money and have
to actually drive the thing.  In order to get significant seat time this
upcoming year, I'm expanding my horizons (beyond vintage) to include PCA DE
and racing events.  What class do I run in?

-you'll be in GT5S, engines between 2 and 2.2 liters in a modified car,
assuming that you keep street rubber on it.  With slicks you'll be in GT5R
and spend more money without much more fun.  A great class, GT5, whihc
normally runs with the stock F-K's at most races, where you will be
competitive with your light weight and decent horsepower.  You may not win
your class if a fully zuzted GT5 shows up, such as the cars that Pat Moyle
builds or Mark Eskuche from Milwaukee, but you'll have a great time and
should have lots of cars to play with.  I wouldn't do much more to it, other
then considering a fuel cell, which may be in the works for GT cars.  How
about coming to Brainerd in June?  bruce Boeder

Cris,

I am posting this to the Fans so that everyone will be up to date on what is
happening.  Regarding you decision to put the PCA Club Racing Rules Book on
the web:

In 1997, the Porsche Club of America Executive Council decreed that neither
the PCA Club Racing rules book, rules updates nor the Newsletter would be on
the internet.  Further, they noted that they would take legal action to
prevent that happening.

I am working with Judy Boles to see if we can get this changed, but that is
the position of the Executive Council at this time.  If I make any progress on
this, I will let you all know.  In the meantime, after Sebring 1998 you will
be able to find race results and the PCA Club Racing Board at www.pca.org and
going to Club Racing.

Further, if you, and people on PorscheFans, disagree with the ruling of the
Executive Council as it now stands, you might let them know.  The members are
pictured at the back of Pano each month.

Thought you ought to know as it's a sticky wicket, at present, and you may be
opening yourself up to some unwelcome attention.

My Best for a Great New Year.

Monte
