Idiot of the Week Award
Special thanks to Keith, who pointed out this week's "Idiot of the Week"
award recipient. The unidentified gentleman is a Porsche owner who may
or may not be a regular Route 2 commuter. We'll call him Richard Cranium
for ease of reading.
Our pal "Dick" was apparently tooling along route 2 westbound from at
least the 128 on-ramp, if not somewhere further east than that.
Apparently, he was being followed by a police cruiser with lights
flashing, which he did not notice. Mr. Policeman was doing this because
he had noticed something "Dick" did not. The Porsche was spewing smoke
like the Jimmy Dean sausage factory.
When "Dick" did notice the smoke pouring out of the hood of his car
flames were involved. His choice of a place to stop was the Mobil
station at Crosby's Corner. Yes, kids, a man with a flaming car drove
into a gas station. Apparently it didn't occur to him that this was a
bad idea. It did occur to the policeman, who generously gave him MANY
citations, including something about endangering the fine folks who were
minding their own business at the gas station. So, hats off to Mr.
Cranium, our Idiot of the Week - proving once again that people with
expensive cars don't necessarily have the brains to survive in this fine
world. Chalk one up for Joe Average.
