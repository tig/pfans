A while ago I asked the lists if anyone knew for sure how to tell which
way was up on a Mocal aftermarket oil thermostat (if it lacked nuts on
the bolts holding its two parts together, which is how the instructions
reference up from down - nuts are down -- on the from cooler to tank
side).  Got one response from someone who wondered same thing and
called factory in Great Britain (which said that bolt heads are up or on
intake to cooler side, as one would expect).

Concluding I had installed mine properly in my 911 race car, but still being
concerned about fact oil coming into thermostat eventually was same
temp as oil in sump tank (this on a race car where I installed temp
sensors in these locations), I took mine off and disassembled it.  To my
dismay I found that the O ring which snaps onto the valve, which in turn
is actuated by increased temperatures and closes off the oil cooler
bypass passage, had simply come off of its groove in the valve and,
although held by a rod within the thermostat, wasn't doing its job. 
Obvious result was thermostat wasn't blocking off the cooler bypass,
hence much of the hot oil wasn't going through the cooler (although
some was, which made it hot and fooled me for quite a while).

Anyone ever have this problem with a Mocal?  One of my buddies said
he had this problem also, although his O ring broke and floated away. 
Any fix for this?  I do use a turbo oil pump, and two oil filters on the
scavange line, one before the thermostat to catch most of the engine
debris, and one between the thermostat and the sump (to catch residual
junk from the coolers), so my guess is that I have some pretty high
pressures and velocities in that thermostat.

It also looks to me that if the Mocal were installed the other way up, oil
flow would lock this O ring into place rather than push it off its perch. 
However, I don't know what this would do to proper functioning of the
thermostat - perhaps it would get schizophrenic as cooler oil cooler
return oil told it to open again.

I put a suitably sized O-ring from my junk box in for my next event, and it
seems to have held up for one day, at least.  However, I am not trusting
of all this, as I am pretty sure this Mocal problem has been at the root of
my oil temperature problems, which in turn have lead to short life for the
#2 and #5 rod bearings.  And I see no reason why the O ring won't just
come off again.  Has anyone run a race only car with no oil thermostat at
all in temperatures varying from 100F to 40F with hot oil temps within
range during cool air temperatures (after a suitable warm-up, to be sure?
I should note I replaced my engine oil cooler and its thermostat with an oil
filter).  Problems with this approach?

Anyone got a factory external oil thermostat casing with ruined threads
on the fittings they would part with for nothing?  The factory system
looks like it may be a better mousetrap.  With 4 gallons of oil in a front
mounted sump, and perhaps another gallon in the various lines, coolers,
and filters, I am hesitant to go with no thermostat at all.
