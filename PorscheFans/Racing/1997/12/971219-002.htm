Does anybody have experiance with tire strengthener?  Racers Wholesale 
is selling some stuff called Track Claw Tire Strengthener, they claim it
reduces lap times and decreases tire wear at the same time.  If it does
increase the life of soft compound/racing tires and decrease lap times
or at least not increase it might be worth it.

In a message dated 97-12-19 03:10:48 EST, you write:
  
<<     In ITA and wishing I was Hans Stuck at the 24hrs of Lemans....  >>
 
Hans Stuck hopes to be driving LeMans too... 

He and Porsche have apparently had a falling out -- they dropped him from the
FIA GT1 program and he has reportedly "severed all ties with Porsche".

I am forwarding this for Jim McCarthy, owner of Windward

Dear P-Fans,

In response to recent listings, let me assure you, at Windward Performance
Products, the customer always comes first.  Given the thousands and thousands
of transactions we have succesfully consumated over the past 12 years, I will
be the first to say, we are not perfect.  We are a million dollar company, run
by people with a real passion for Porsche automobiles.  I started this company
because of all the BS I experienced in the Porsche performance parts
aftermarket.  Occasionally, mistakes or miscommunications are made.  Every
single time, I want to know about it.  I want to fix it.  I want to make it
right.  I am in business to do business, not to lose customers.  Period.  

Do business where you want, but know how I feel about what we do at Windward.
Thanks.

Jim McCarthy
