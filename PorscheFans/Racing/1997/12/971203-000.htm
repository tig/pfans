Hi Bill,

Looks like both of us are are right and both of us are wrong! I don't
know what is parked out front of your shop, but if it has the original
dash removed and the heater core removed then it is illegal for ITC
according to the folks on the wheeltowheel mailing list. I'll send you
the replies if you like...

I was mistaken about the roll cage. It used to be illegal to weld them
in but it is not longer the case.

Regards,

Paul Foster
