Bill, Bill,  Bill,  Bill.... 
 
I'm surprized by your ITC statements. 
 
The ITC car is ILLEGAL by the SCCA GCR's.  They read 'no modifications' are 
allowed except for those specifically documented in the rules.  This was 
intended to prohibit liberal application for the shades of gray.  If you
read 
the protests in 'Sports Car's fast track section'  you'll note that unless
the 
GCR expressly authorizes the specific modification your ILLEGAL... 
 
Acid Dipped...   Go to Jail and Do not Pass Go 
Removal of Heater...  Go to Jail and Do not Pass Go 
Removal of Dash...  Go to Jail and Do not Pass Go 
 
This type of prep is why IT will NEVER be a national class.  This is a
shame, 
since I think the class should replace SS or the new TN classes.   
 
These cars sound like they are ready for the Production classes. 
 
If these cars make it to the Midwest becareful, Cuz, we do Protest and the 
driver can kiss his/her comp licence good by... 
 
Thanks for letting us know about the cars, will be watching for them...  See 
them at Tech... 
 
Those of us who run within the rules feel real sorry for any who is running
a 
cheater,  especially when we win...  
 

*******************************************************************************

This was not intended as a flame,  but a feeble attempt at humor directed 
toward the lack of rule enforcement at the REGIONAL level by the SCCA. Yes
the 
race officials work hard and do a great job,  and it does no one any good to 
send racers home with their cars in peices, let alone the amount of
resources 
it takes to validate legality. Unfortunetly the personal integrity issue
that 
SCCA management hopes exist is lacking.  So, Yes IT is a RUN-WHAT-YOU-BRUNG 
class and only we your fellow racers are expected to protest those who are 
cheating for the rules be enforced.  Sad...  So Sad... 
 
The key is to make the car visually appear legal,  make the sound reading,
and 
make minimum weight.  
 
What perplexes me is why does someone spent the big$ and the resources to 
build an illegal car for a simple $10 ornimate (same goes for rubbing)?  All 
they (cheaters) are doing is deceiving their selves of their inherent
skills,  
are they really that insecure? 
 
The joy is competing and running wheel to wheel (no rubbing please).  Some
of 
the best racing is found back in the pack where everyone is bumper to bumper 
and wheel to wheel regardless of the class (he preaches standing from the 
pedistal).  Running alone out in front is boring!  I been there and I found
it 
no different then time trialing.   
 
Please note my car is legal...  and it will stay legal as long as I own it
and 
I do not encourage anyone to push the boundries of legality unless you like 
watching from the stands. 
Yes I'm competitive most of the time,  but those &^%@ CRX's are the class of 
the ITA field.  Maybe a fresh engine and a new gear set,  yeh, thats the 
ticket,  death to the CRXs....
