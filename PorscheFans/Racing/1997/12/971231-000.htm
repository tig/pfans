   Ok, ok. I can tell I have offended a few and I want to put a stop to this
right now before the Viking gets the word 60th hand that I called him a
cheater and comes over to look me up at the next event ;-)

   First of all we all agree that the teddy care  is faster than shit,
right? We all agree that it is driven well, right? All I am saying is that I
followed Bob J around Thunderhill cuz I know he is *always* fast and I
wanted to see if he was an *awsome* driver and I was wanting to learn from
him. Besides the fact that the car is a rocket, I noticed when I followed
him around his lines were not what I would call ideal, but, the car was
still faster than shit ;-)

   I am not saying Bob J is cheating nor did I ever say that. I am genuinely
curious if other G cars prepared to the limit of the rules are as fast as
teddy. If that is the case then I would say that the *G* SC is an awsome
little car for sure and I have never seen another *G* SC run like that one
including the car Buckler was driving at the same event. I have been
impressed by teddy since the first time I saw it when both Eric and Bob were
driving it.

   Fun? Doin it better? Well, I am havin a blast for sure. I have run with
teddy 4 times. Once at Willow Springs in a 944S2 F car with no prep at all
and beat him both in lap times and the race and qualifying even being 123lb
over min weight plus the 250lb for driver. The next weekend at Sears I
qualified on the front row in the rain a few rows ahead of Eric/Bob (don't
remember which) but left my car setup soft hoping for more rain (which never
came) and had miserable oversteer and buried it in the mud in turn 8 ;-( 

   Then last month at Thunderhill and Sears in a C car and we were faster
again (should be huh?) even posting the fastest lap of all competitors in
the rain on sunday morning at Sears and in every wet session all three days
except one where it kept getting dryer as we ran.

   I am not afraid to admit that Bob and Eric are wonderful drivers. And
also that I am havin lotsa fun and am very content with how my record looks
in PCA club racing, uhhh, cept Portland :-)

 Best Wishes for the New Year from sunny Minnesota -Bruce Boeder 

   Thanx Bruce, right back at ya!
I hope I can fill a truck to come out and race with you guys this year.

BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
that important, now could it? ;-) white)
