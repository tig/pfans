Hey gang, I read a posting a day or so ago about Kumho tires being faster
than FG's.  While being faster is always nice, everything may be a trade off
as far as longevity.  I would like to know which tires give you good times
and last a decent time.  I am going to be faced with purchasing my first set
and would rather not have to do it again at my second event.  Any input and
previous experiences would be helpful.  I have talked to someone who loved
Hoosiers but said they didn't last as long as BFGs.  Thanks for your advice.
