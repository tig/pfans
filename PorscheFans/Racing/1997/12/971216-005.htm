Great story Matt!  For the uninitiated, such as myself, really helps to put
many things in perspective.  The dreams of rushing through the pack are
probably shared by us all.

However, you did point out a concern which has been one of mine, as well.
 Seems as though some may take this "club racing" a bit too seriously.  And
will do whatever is necessary to win: including rule bending, rough driving,
and harassment off the track.  (IMO, you had every right to adjust the tact
lacking, moron's attitude in a not so friendly way.)  I've always considered
club racing to be more of a gentlemans sport than say Professional Sports Car,
etc.  I hate to get caught up in a spending war in order to be competitive.
 I've seen so called "stock" class cars with $35,000 in modifications.  Perhaps
they were moved up a class, but then they're faster than the new class they're
in anyways.  Hey, you only get a trophy in club racing.  If someone believes
they are the next Fangio, they should go race in a professional series and
leave the club racing to the enthusiasts who are out more for the enjoyment of
racing.

I did a season of DE through the Chicago Region and like you, am very hooked.
 Seems the natural progression is to club race.  Perhaps in '99.  I still don't
think I'd feel comfortable in race traffic.  And I consider my car to be very
fast.  It'll take a bit more track time before I think I could race safely and
competitively.

Question:  how long did you do DE?  At what point did you feel confident to
club race?

Thanks,
