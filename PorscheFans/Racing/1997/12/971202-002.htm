Paul,

This is slightly off on IT cars.  I have the ITC champion's car parked
about 10 ft from me...  :-)   They do allow a welded in cage and removal of
the heater, and the interiors are mostly stripped.  There must be a
passenger seat, but that is about it.  Our car has been acid dipped, a full
custom cage, heater removed, race prepped Rebello engine, remove carpeting,
removed back seat (with a fabricated aluminum cover plate), fuel cell, etc.
 While this is supposed to be an economical class, to win, you need to
spend BIG bucks.  The driver of this car switches his GS-CS tires for EVERY
race.... Our second ITC car even has it dash rmoved completely to be
replaced with a fabricated steel one!  So, these are far from stock cars...
 OTOH, the engine modifications are limited to:  Carb, exhaust, and intake
mods.  BTW, our two cars are 510s.  I think the second car finished 8th for
the season (a big t-bone crash kept him out of the final few races.)
