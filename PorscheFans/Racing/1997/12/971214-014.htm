>[This message is being sent to 911, General and Racing, very very carefully
>in three separate posts.  Anyone who can safely do so is welcome to 
>forward to the other model-based lists.  I don't subscribe to those and 
>think I'd better not, lest I risk adding myself to that special
illustrious list . . .]
>
>The dates have been set for the 1998 Zone 7 Beginner and Intermediate 
>Autocross School.  May 2 & 3 at Candlestick Park (3COM for the 
>infidels among you).  This 2-day school spends Saturday on basic
>exercises (skidpad, braking, decreasing-radius, linked turns, slalom, etc.)
>then features two autocross courses on Sunday.  Enrollment is limited
>to 90 students and it will fill up very fast once the notices hit the Zone
>7 regional newsletters in either the Jan or Feb issues.  There will be
>about 60 instructors, so the student-instructor ratio is very good.
>
>I can absolutely recommend this weekend as one of the best ways to
>get into competitive driving or to hone your skills.  I ran the school for
>a number of years.  Chairmen Masuo Robinson and Jeff Sykes took
>over last year.  All their changes have been for the better.
>
>We have had a number of people travel to the school from the southland
>and from Oregon/Washington.  Those who have done so reported that
>it was a worthwhile trip.  I would suggest that the Bay Area is a nice
>place to visit with your Porsche anyway, but the school schedule is
>pretty strenuous with lots of course time and no one's going to want
>to party very much either evening.
>
>Cost is $90.
>
>To proceed, contact Masuo:  
>	"Masuo Robinson" <masuo@ix.netcom.com>
>
>Happy holidays.
