Okay, for all you folks looking for an alternative to expensive racing I
suggest you check out:

http://www.muller.net/karting/index.html

You can race an entire season in a vehicle that pulls almost 3G's in a turn
for only a few thousand $/year.  Standard entry fees are between $20-$30
for a sprint race, slightly more for an enduro if you want to race at
Sumitt, Mid Ohio, Daytona, etc...  Even Carroll Smith recommends karting as
the best way to learn racing.

         Just a note to be aware of Motor Sport Road and Racing who has
recently posted some parts for sale. 
         I purchased a racing seat from him that was more "used" than I was
lead to believe. I told him that I wasn't happy with the condition of the seat
and that I would like to return it. He said fine. Some how UPS could not find
his address stated on the bill. He claims he never got it and UPS said the
address didn't exist. The seat is in limbo with UPS. It is pretty hard to
check out both parties when they are 3000 miles away. All that I am saying is
make sure you know what you are getting and that you heavy insure it.
