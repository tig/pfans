Steve Meltzer is trying to start up that old chestnut:  to anti-seize or not to
anti-seize.  The 911 list had this going last spring (and probably the year
before, and on Porschephiles before that, ad nauseam).  Says he
always uses it, but broke a stud off on his Corvette and wonders if the
lubrication allowed the stud to stretch too far at the specified 100
pounds/feet when maybe the manufacturer meant it to be put on dry.  He
wonders if this will happen on his 944.

I offer these tidbits of prejudice.

No, you won't break the lugs on your 944 (although I'd suggest 92-96
pounds feet).  Obviously Corvettes have lousy steel or terrible quality
control, or some such.  (seriously, must have had a flaw in the part)  No
self respecting designer is going to set the torque spec for this
application so close to ultimate tensile strength or even the yield point. 
Rims are not subject to the kinds of loads that connecting rods are, and
you only need to stretch the bolt enough to keep the nut from vibrating
off.  So there is no need to get it just so.  And it sees hard and varied
service.  And thus the lug has plenty of reserve to cope with the
differences in applied stretch between lubed and dry.  

Just to give you an idea, the 12mm bolts which hold flywheels onto 2.7s
are speced at about 110 pounds/feet, and you are told to use these only
once, although lots of people reuse them without problems so it is
doubtful this is ear the elastic limit.  I torque mine to 150 pounds/feet wet
with loctite (though I do pitch them religiously), and they don't break (and
they do keep the flywheel on at 8000 rpm).  I don't know if the 14mm lugs
on our cars are grade 12.9 like the flywheel bolts, but 100 pounds wet
shouldn't cause them to break a sweat, although it might be starting to be
a bit much for the alloy wheels. 

I've never seen a manufacturer specify whether the lug nut torque was
wet or dry, although maybe someone has seen such a specification
somewhere sometime in some language.  In addition, consider what they
know will happen:  People will use the supplied tire wrench or whatever
to change their tires.  They won't use torque wrenches (we do, but we
are racers and Porsche owners and a bit anal, with some reason
considering how often we change tires for racing).  Do you see tires
rolling down the street with any frequency?  No - good and solid with the
factory tool, or the typical cross tool, or whatnot does the job. 
Lubricated or not.  Were this not the case, it would be like a bowling alley
of runaway tires out there on the city streets and freeways, considering
how many idiots there are around.

As an aside, I think the incidence, from my experience, of tires coming
loose on their lugs at the track is higher per mile than on the highway. 
We get in a hurry, get interrupted, get called to the driver's meeting,
whatever, and forget.   I  Or someone else (spouse) was supposed to
do it. I bet almost all who read this have seen this happen to someone at
a track.   I either tighten everything all the way around and refuse
interruption, or put the torque wrench on the driver's seat.   

At the high end, it is easy to forget (well, it happens, anyway) what
humongous torque is needed to tighten (read, induce a little stretch in) a
racing centerlock.  It seems that perhaps this is less obvious to the driver
before disaster also.  In Driver's ed and Club Racing with these more
sophisticated cars I've seen a wheel come off twice.  Once on the pole
sitter when the green flag dropped.  Talk about consternation in those
pits.  Scary when you think of where the tires might have gone, too.

So, I posit that it ain't that you torque it to a gnat's ass, it's that you do
torque it to a reasonable figure.  Has to help that torques are same on all
lugs, too.  Checking between runs, or at least every once and a while,
isn't a bad habit either.

I put the silver stuff on the lugs of my street/racer occasionally mainly to
keep the rust off, since Club Racing mandated open ended nuts and I put
in longer studs and have to use them anyway.  I don't, at least very
often, on the racer racer's lugs because it isn't out in the weather, and I
run race tires and use trailering tires and spend half my life at the track
changing tires and the silver stuff gets on me, my driver's suit, and picks
up sand when the nuts are lying in the dirt, etc.  Same torque, same good
results, either way.

Antisieze also prevents galling on the hemispherical mating surfaces, to
which it ought also to be applied if one is going to the trouble of using it,
but It isn't at all clear to me just how important it is to keep these pretty,
hidden under the nut as they are.

As I said, my prejudices on the subject.
