    Brad:

    As far as I know, all the bolt-in cages have removable door
    bars... I have an Autopower cage in my 914, and I leave the door
    bars (and the diagonal rear-hoop brace) out while I'm driving on
    the street.

    Even if you choose a welded-in cage, you can choose to make the
    door bars removable... Talk to your roll-cage supplier.

    Unless you're really ugly already -- so you don't care whether
    you lose any more teeth, or break your jaw or nose, or melt the
    skin off your face in a fire -- an open-face helmet is dumb...
    Especially given your statement that you "do not want to skimp
    on safety".

    Right... And rightfully so; the SFI spec (and its FIA
    counterpart) is only concerned with the amount of protection a
    suit gives, not with how that protection is accomplished.

    Personally, I have no preference for one fabric over another --
    you'll have to make that decision based on cost, comfort, color,
    etc. -- but I DO have a bias against suits that only meet
    3.2A/5.

    Here's an excerpt from a message that I wrote earlier this year
    on the subject:

        Suits built to the SFI 3.2A/5 spec (the one you're
        considering) provide about 9 seconds of protection in the
        heat of a gasoline fire before you suffer second-degree
        burns.  Nomex underwear adds a little more time, but not ALL
        that much.

        An SFI 3.2A/10 suit, on the other hand, will give you around
        19 seconds (and suits that meet the FIA spec give almost the
        same protection)... The tradeoff is that the "/10" and FIA
        suits are less comfortable in warm weather and more
        expensive than the "/5" suits.

        Here's an experiment you can try to see whether a "/5" suit
        is appropriate for you:

            Put on your gloves and helmet, buckle yourself into your
            car and close the window net, then imagine that a fire's
            started and have a friend start a stopwatch.

            Count two seconds to notice that the car's on fire, wait
            three more seconds for the car to come to a halt, close
            your eyes (you won't be able to see much in an actual
            fire), and see how long it takes to unbuckle the belts,
            remove the steering wheel, open the window net, climb
            out, and roll on the ground a couple of times.

        I can pretty much guarantee that it'll take more than 9
        seconds for the whole process.

        For this reason, I wouldn't want to be wearing anything less
        than a 3.2A/10- or FIA-approved suit.

    Just my opinion; I could be wrong.
