Here is my two cents. 
 
I agree with everyone,  there is no correct answer.  As for track time,  we
in 
that midwest (Chicago) do have a few more choices,  MSCC, SSCA, PCA, ...  we 
have two tracks extremely close to home (Backhawk,  and Road America),  
Grattan and Gingerman are additionaly very close if you don't get stuck in
the 
traffic trying to get around the bottom of the lake,  but thats a different 
story. 
 
Down side of the PCA thing is, there is not enough RACING events in the
local 
area,  such a shame.   
 
The three local SCCA clubs (Blackhawk Valley, Western Michigan and Chicago) 
keeps all the local tracks very busy.  This provide ample local racing 
opertunities for us.   The second benefit is that we have several 
mini-enduro's   This provides an hour long race,  this after a practice, 
qualifying and a sprint.  Loads of fun and tons of track time.  (my single 
biggest expense in travel)  
 
MSCC provides opertunities for those additional open dates when the local
club 
races are not so local.  This group is more layed back and a great group to 
run with. 
 
So the jist is I enjoy running in the SCCA IT series even with all the rule 
bending due to the enduros.   
 
The Spec Racers Fords (SRF)are also provided this enduro opertunity on the 
regional level as well.  The SRF is a close (this means expensive) series on 
the national level.  Body work will become your all consuming hobby.  As for 
the French period,  rubbing was still in vogue,  the nick name was Sports 
Rambo. 
 
So the jist of this rambling is,  take the time to evaluate your ambitions
and 
level set that against the amount of funding your (or your domestic partner 
is) willing to invest to achieve it.  If the two meet, great,  if not, then 
somewhere in the middle is an acceptable personal answer. 
 
Good Luck! 
 
  Michael 
 
    In ITA and wishing I was Hans Stuck at the 24hrs of Lemans....
