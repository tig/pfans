Makes sense to me - I'll bet they had fire extinguishers right at hand
at the gas station. Beats taking a left into Walden Pond at the next
light.

I' called Windward to inquire about a set of adapters for Big Reds on my 93
RSA.  I told them that I had a drop dead date for receipt the Wed. of the next
week.  The call was made on Friday.

Jay called back and left a message in which he said he could get the parts to
me if I was willing to pay two overnight FedEx charges.  I was to call back if
I wanted to order them.  I didn't call back and ordered them from another
dealer who didn't charge me twice.  They were installed in time and I was
happy.

I got unhappy 3 weeks later when a set of adapters showed up at my house.  My
daughter signed for them.  Jay had billed them to my card with no
authorization from me.  My card was on record from a previous order.

After a month of being put off by Jay, never talked to Jim, I had to go to my
credit card company to get the charges off my card.  Windward kept a 20%
restock fee for something I didn't order!!!!

If anyone wants detailed info send me a private post.

I'll add this to my performance chip from Windward which shows a nice 2 hp
loss for only $400.  I almost forgot, I was told by Jim that the next item I
purchased something from him it would be at his cost to make up for the chip.
Let's see, full retail plus shipping for something I didn't order coupled with
a 20% restock fee.  Nice way to make up for the chip.

I have since talked to other people with order problems, resolved but only
after several phone calls.

For my money I'll use another vendor.  But I'm sure there are lots of people
who are happy with Windward.  I'm not among that group!!
