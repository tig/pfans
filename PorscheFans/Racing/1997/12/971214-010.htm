Hi everyone.

   I have a couple of questions concerning suspension setup on my 1972
911 Targa. As of right now the car is pretty much stock except that it's
about 500 pounds lighter. My plans were to Autocross the car and
occasionally drive it on the street. I have looked through Bruce
Andersons book but Im still a little cloudy as to the proper setup.
Basically what I wanted to know is what would be the optimum setup?
torsion bars, tires, sway bars, camber... Tire wear is not really a big
concern as the car would not be a daily driver.  If i could get some
input from people doing these kinds of mods.  it would be greatly
appreciated.                                                             
          
					Thank You
