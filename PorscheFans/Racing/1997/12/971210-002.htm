No this was run by a guy named Bentley out of Washington DC area. 

Dave Coleman's shop at Summit Point WV is rebuilding the motor and body
for me. Cleaning out rust, and "freashing" the motor. As of this time we
are not sure what the motor is, the case is a 2L case but the cams are
S's as well as dist. The fan housing is Red like an S not Green like it
should be.

In that I have yet to title the car in Maryland, PCNA will not run a
search of the database until I can show a title naming me as the owner,
so I can't check the motor SN#.

My plans are open for the car, but I will not race it, or at least
that's what I think today.

	Dear Mr Freedman.

	Regarding the 71 Daytona 914 that you were talking about.  Was
this the car
	that was owned and raced by Ralph Meany of Washington state?
