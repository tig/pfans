Josh Halder inquires about suitability of Dzus fasteners to hold a spoiler
on his 914.  The Pegasus catalog (required reading for all would be
racers) gives the following specs:  sheer 200 lbs, tension 85 lbs.  Also
lists how to figure what length of stud and height of spring to get
depending on the thickness of the "stack" involved.  I've only used the
self-ejecting kind (because they stay put when loosened), but have seen
a buddy removing the other kind he uses on his GT 914 to hold a lip on
the bottom of his spoiler on.  Racer Wholesale catalog has drawing of
this other kind - the ones that come out in your hand and you have to
store somewhere and reinsert.  He uses quite a few.  More fasteners =
more strength.  The weld plate spring receptacles are nice, although the
other kinds are fairly easy to use.  Summit Racing has a variety of
brackets for these fasteners.
