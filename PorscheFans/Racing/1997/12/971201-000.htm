I would think the dual rate (stacked) spring would be an excellent 
combination for rough tracks, but you would have to control body roll 
more (anti-roll bars) than with an standard "single" rate spring.  I 
found that the shock valving was rather critical with higher than 
stock rate springs, and careful adjustment of the bump with 500 lb. 
springs should get you a pretty terrific handling car without going to 
a dual rate spring stack.  You already have a "progressive" setup in 
the rear with your torsion bars in place with the 300 lb. springs as 
helpers, so I wouldn't bother with a dual rate spring in the rear at 
all.  The money might be better spent on hard (spherical) bushings ALL 
around in the suspension, and hard mounts for the rear subframe, as 
these changes really provide an sharpness and consistency to the 944 
that is sorely lacking with the stock bushings.  Unless the track is 
really rough, or you need the weight transfer because you are running 
super high spring rates (oval track setup, 650 lbs. or higher) I 
wouldn't spend the money - you may not go any faster!
Good Luck!

Hi Chris,

I was very interested to see your comments about 951 setup.  I 
currently use
a 944 S2 for events here in Australia for 'Superspint' (lap dashes) 
type
events.  The car still has torsion bars in the rear but I have a set 
of
double adjustable Konis that use on BOTH ends of the car.  I runn 
500lb
front and 300 lb rear when the car is on the track with standard sway 
bars.
I was considering using an Eibach ERS setup that has a small lower 
spring
rate tender spring and a much higher rate main spring.

Have you had any experience with this sort of setup or any other 
progressive
set up?  I know the Factory Turbo Cup springs were progressive from 
150-405
lbs (I think) but they would not fit on the current spring perches.  I 
would
appreciate any views and your experience.

Many thanks in advance

Azim
