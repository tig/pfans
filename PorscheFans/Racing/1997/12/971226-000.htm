Happy holidays Harry,
I'm prepping my '90 911C2 to run this year in Club Racing.  I've several
questions that hopefully you'd be able to answer or give an opinion on.

1.  I have removed my rear seats ( mainly to give me greater access to the
rear, ie. clean the rear window without having muscle spasms squeezing in the
back).  Is this legal even if I stay within the minimum weight requirements?

2.  I have a small crack on my windshield (that looks like it has stopped
spreading, about 8 inches long) that is located paralled to the antenna in the
center of the windshield.  Will I pass tech or do I have to get a new one?
Will using a Lexan windshield move me out of my F stock class?

3.  If I switch to RS America style door panels, will I move classes?  I
believe the rules read that modifications to trim are allowed if they
interfere with the installation of roll cage/bar.  I haven't yet installed my
cage, but it appears as though it will be a very tight fit.  

Thanks for any help you can forward along.

-Manny Alban
