P-Fans,

This is a feeler to see if there is any interest in my car.  I'm
*thinking*
of selling and getting something newer.  I guess I've run out of things
to upgrade and it's time for a new car.  
This car was set up for track and autocross but is still very
comfortable
on the street.  I did about 10 Driver's Ed events over the last 2 years 
and it was very competitive at the local NNJR/PCA autox placing in the 
top 3 and winning the modified class this year.  It is light and fast
enough 
to hold off the Carreras and stay with the 993s (no kidding).
No racing other than autocross use (about 12 autox total).
All other maintenance - synthetic oil, new plugs, filters etc.
