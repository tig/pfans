Just a FYI post:

 I had took my car to the Wheel Works in Santa Clara, CA
to have new rears mounted. When I got home and looked at the
rims I have a scratch that runs around the rim edge and a gouge
in a spoke. (both sides). So I returned to the shop and showed
them the problem. First they said they would take care of it. Then I
was told to call back at 3:00pm (friday) which I did. The shop manager
told me to come down on Monday. I showed up and he looked at them.

 From there he (fred) said his best guy worked on it and that I was
trying to get my rims fixed for free. Basically call me a Liar. I should
of told him first that these are scratch free rims (he said this). Very
unprofessional. I have called the main office and filed a complaint.

Bottom line: Beware and watch those guys like a hawk. I will file a 
complaint and a claim on my insurance, I will never use them again. 

Now the choice is yours.
