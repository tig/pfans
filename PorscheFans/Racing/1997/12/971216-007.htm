Matt:

My family was at Roebling also.  My son drives the red/black/yellow 951
in E class.  I drive a red/white/blue 73 911 in F class.  
I am glad you enjoyed yourself.  However, don't pressure yourself into
thinking you have to spend more and more and more to have fun. 
Remember, better drivers outdrive better cars every race lap.  My son is
pretty good and learned in a 79 924 in J class that consistently
finished in the top few of H class 944's.

The name of the game is having fun.  A lot of the guys and gals don't
understand this.  I gues I am old and slow, I finish in the middle of a
very large class consistently and I am happy  to do that.  I have all
the fun I can handle.  Winning would be great, but either my car or my
skills aren't up to it. So what?  Have a blast.  Some of the best racing
goes on between cars further back in the field.


Good luck.  Hope to see you again at the races.

Dave Hardee

Re: Rothman -QMS message
I've had a lousy experience with Kempton. An overpriced 944S2 engine that had
a cracked block. I think the response was something like "you're in
california, I'm in Florida. Sue me!"

Interesting, I posted to the list yesterday but my return address didn't show
up. So I will try again.

Does anyone have a front and\or rear bumper for a street '91 C2/C4.   Color is
unimportant.  If so please respond to :
 CVANAUSTEN@aol.com

Thanks,
Carl Van Austen
