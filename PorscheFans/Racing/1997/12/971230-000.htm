I have no axe to grind with Windward - I'm not even a customer, although I
tried.

Another list member, who had had good experiences with Windward, suggested I
contact them regarding suspension mods I was making to my '87 951.  It took me
about six phone calls (4 or 5 days) to speak to someone besides the
receptionist.

When I finally did reach a salesman, he didn't know the difference in a Pugeot
and a Porsche!  He promised to call back in a few minutes.  That was four
weeks ago.  Maybe tomorrow.

Just another data point.
