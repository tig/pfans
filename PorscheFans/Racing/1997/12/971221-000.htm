i beleve that I saw some discussion on roll cage vs roll bar a while back
but I'm not sure that the best type of roll cage was ever discussed.  I have
seen those advertized by Autopower and Racetech and have even seen one
installed.  My situation is this:  I would like to be able to drive the car
on the street occationally and hopefully remove the across the door brace
that goes there.  I do not want to skimp on safety, at high speeds, its just
not worth it.  What is the best arrangement for the money?  Would getting
someone to custom weld the cage be better?  (welded in would limit
participation in certain SCCA events right?)  I do plan to club race,
probably in the "also-ran" category.  Any input would be helpful.  If this
was already discussed, please give me a time frame if you know it.

Also, when it comes to helmets and nomex, what types are best?  I have heard
discussions for both closed and open face helmets.  I know I want to go with
at least SFI3.2A/5 but that doesn't say anything about 2 or 3 layer Nomex,
cotton, etc.  So many decisions, so little time.

Thanks,
