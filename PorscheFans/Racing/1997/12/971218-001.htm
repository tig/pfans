There has been a very interesting thread on the "VetteNet" (shh!don't
tell anyone that I own tupperware cars!) dealing with the pros and cons
for using anti-seize on lug nuts, studs and hub surfaces. I thought that
this was really a "no-brainer" (I'm so compulsive that I feel remiss and
negligent when I don't use it), but the point was rasied that
lubrication of any thread will change the theoretic torque setting.
Thus, torqueing (does spelling count??) a lugnut treated with anti-seize
to 100ft-lbs, as I do on my 96 'Vette, actually puts much more torque on
the stud. This, the arguement goes, stretches and distorts it. Indeed, I
have snapped off a stud on my '96 'vette despite it being "correctly
torqued" just 6 weeks and 200 miles earlier (the car is garaged when not
in use). I have not previously had this experinece, and am curious if
anyone has any thoughts about this. steve meltzer resurrected '88 944
turbo s, Zermatt silver. Mechanic wannabe, Mac Believer <G>...."leave
later, drive faster, and still arrive first"
