The word on Kumhos in SCCA Solo circles is that they are potentialy just
as quick, not faster. And wear a little better. However, a very big
reason why the BFGs are so popular is the asymetric sidewall
construction. This construction bestows a sort of pseudo-camber effect,
meaning that you genearlly won't need as much negative camber as you
would with other tires. This is a major plus in classes where camber
adjustment is very limited. However, the downside is a very stiff tire
carcass that has a very slip-n-grip kindof behaviour compared to some of
the other tires. Is the BFG faster though? I don't think so. Is the
Kumho a comparable tire? Very likely. But the BFG is do damn popular
that there aren't that many people running anything else. So the data is
not very thorough.
