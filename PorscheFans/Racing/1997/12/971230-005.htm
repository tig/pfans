Ross of '86 Carrera fame questions the source of the weights and
horsepower figures used in the Club Racing rule book, in particular those
for '86 Carreras, since he knows his is entirely stock as far as weight
goes (one must suppose, and his aftermarket chip which will move him
up from F into E doesn't weigh less than the stock one) is 2756.  Others
write back pointing out that these figures are similar to those from
factory manuals and like sources, and tell of the need to fill gas tank full
in order to meet minimum weight at race's end, etc.  And not to worry.

Welcome to the world of the nominal, and the rules maker's dilemmas.  I
checked the weights he gave against the Parade Competition Rules
listing (from which I strongly suspect Club Racing initially drew, as they
are pretty comprehensive and all in one place).  The weights are the
same.  From past conversations with members of the PCR committee, I
know that the PCR weights are drawn from published factory figures.  

That, however, raises the question of where the factory figures come
from.  There is quite a difference between a minimum option (no air, no
power windows, seats, or door locks, no sun roof, no leather interior, no
anything you can avoid) car and one which is loaded.  And these
weights are going to include the spare, jack, tool set, and so on.  When
the factory decides to publish a curbweight or any other weight, how is
it supposed to decide which of the many configurations in which the car
might leave the factory it should use?  I think that is the reason people
may weigh various perfectly "stock" vehicles and find different weights. 
Maybe the factory was high one year, or didn't change its published
specs even though it altered the mix of options the next year, or
whatnot.  Maybe it even had some inscrutable racing class homologation
advantage in mind.

For some sorts of classification purposes, the nominal nature of weights
may not matter.  The PCRs don't, as far as I can interpret them, require
that a really stock car actually make its nominal weight as long as it
hasn't had any disallowed lightening done to it.  If you had a bare bones
car which was under nominal (perhaps because you availed yourself of
"free" modifications like racing seats weighing one third what stock
weighed on a minimum accessory car) weight for its year of birth, no
matter.  Lucky you (I think - that's just the way I read the PCRs).  On the
other hand, if you had changed your car (like me, making an SC out of a
77S by flaring it and putting in an SC engine), then you had to make the
nominal weight (as well as other parameters) of the car you had made
yours into.  If someone's "real" SC happened to weigh less, lucky him,
tough for you - that's the price you pay for playing car manufacturer by
udating your car.

In Club Racing, things are somewhat more equal - you have to make the
specified weight for what your car is.  Got a gripe, see the chaplain. 
The stewards don't care why you are light (although they might do more
than disqualify you if they thought you were trying to fudge because
under the upholstery the sheet metal looked like a swiss cheese from
lightening holes you had drilled).  So if you lucked out with a light stock
car, you can smile when others complain about the extra weight of a roll
cage, or whatnot, because maybe you can still be at the minimum end of
things.

Horsepower figures may be even dodgier.  It appears that engines can
vary a surprising amount in horsepower (considering they are precision
mass produced, so you'd think there wouldn't be any difference at all)
right out the factory gate.  Porsche tests theirs, I believe, so one which
doesn't measure up to some minimum won't escape.  People fantasize
that the factory may keep the ones which exceed some spec, due to
fortunate coincidences of tolerances and whatnot, for their own racing
use.  In any event, the factory again has to choose what it considers to
be "the" horsepower for its offerings.  It might be optimistic or it might be
conservative (recall tales of 400 nominal engine horsepower 993 twin
turbos producing 400 or almost 400 measured rear wheel horsepower
on a chassis dyno).  And it might undergo unexplained changes.  74 (and
75?) 911s were advertised at 175 horsepower, but 76s and 77s were
"derated" to 165 even though engines were the same (plus or minus
some monkeying around with exhaust system, California cars, etc, not to
be sneezed at, but that was the figure for ROW cars also).  Where did
that 10 hp go? 

Of course, any club racer worth his or her salt is going to put on a better
exhaust system (or at least the fabled '74 heat exchanger/exhaust for
74-87 911s), so some of the nice arithmetic of the weight to horsepower
calculations is instantly out of whack. 

No matter, really.  Again, Alan and Harry and the other patron saints of
Club Racing took published figures, warts and all, lined them up in weight
to power order, picked places to draw lines, and there are the classes
we have.  From what I can see they were pretty successful, so a really
good driver in what looks like the bottom of the class has a fighting
chance against a car which on form might seem like it would be at the
top.  Where this demonstrably didn't work out in practice, they have
made some adjustments over the years through the simple expedient of
moving a slow model down or a fast model up.  This isn't as easy as it
may seem, however, given how much influence a spot on suspension
setup and a really good (as opposed to merely capable and experienced)
driver can have.  Just because a certain G SC from the frozen North
might seem to wax its fellows regularly, and also maybe the F cars,
tends not to impress the rules writers.  If most SCs were doing this, that
would be a different matter, but that happens only in our dreams.  There
have been amazingly few adjustments over the life of the program.

As others have pointed out, one shouldn't worry overly much about the
seeming arbitrariness of these classifications.  As long as they produce
reasonably close racing we're having fun.  Or should be.

Happy New Year

Walt Fricke (who has to be careful about weight for wife's G car, but not
for his GT-4).
