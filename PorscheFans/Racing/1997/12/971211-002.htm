   Sound Tire of Tacoma Wa. is unloading on their stock of Kumho Victoracer road race/autocross R compound tires at a reduced price to clear 'em out.

sizes available are as follows:

(4) 205-50 X 15 @ $109 ea.
(8) 265-45 x 16 @ $129 ea. this is a killer tire for the rear of 911, 944 and all around for the F-body and 84 to 88 Corvettes with 16" wheels 
(4) 275-40 x17 @ $137 ea.

These are *BLOWOUT* prices and of course they are killer tires that ripsnort! ;-)

   Back to back testing at Thunderhill Raceway had us doing going *1 FULL SECOND FASTER* per lap just by switching from BFGs to Kumhos from 1 session to the next. The BFGs were heat cycled and the Kumho were fresh shavers.

   Try 'em and see.

The number is 253-272-1167 and you must ask for Jess. 


PS could someone please forward this to the wheel to wheel list please?
