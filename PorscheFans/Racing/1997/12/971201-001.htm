No, but you really can tune that with the cars balance.  If you still 
have understeer, and have made all the other changes I've mentioned in 
other postings, and have maxed out your swaybars F/R - add more rear 
spring!  I was running 500/400 with a full stiff rear bar and balance 
was ideal.

Thanks for the speedy (pardon the pun) response Chris. I am tending to 
think
the way that you have suggested.  My belief in terms of going faster 
is that
the best investment is to 'drive faster'.  Do you know what the 
effective
rate is for the standard torsion bars in the rear of a 951/S2?

Thanks again

Azim
