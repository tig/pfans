Hi gang,
Well, my 90 911C2 is quicking being prepped for the upcoming club racing
season.  I just have a few questions about certain modifications and if they
can be done.

1.  Interior.  I replaced both drivers and passenger seats with racing seats
so that both five point harnesses can be used.  I imagine that's ok.  I also
have removed the folding part of my rear seats.  Is that ok?  I am thinking of
changing my door panels to the RS America type.  I don't know if that's legal
or not.  I just hope the stock panels don't affect the installation of the
autopower roll cage that I will be installing.

2.  Suspension.  I've just sold one of my other cars and have some available
cash to significantly upgrade the suspension.  Can I install a Cup Car setup?

3.  Windshield.  I've just cracked my windshield for the second time in less
than six months.  Both times at Bridgehampton. Any negatives with a Lexan vs.
glass windshield.  The crack is about 8" long that originates from the dash on
up.  Would that fail Tech?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
