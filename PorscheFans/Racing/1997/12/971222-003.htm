Hello,

> what all of you are using currently.  I am sick and tired of using 2

I currently have two stopwatches like that. One is, believe it or not,
a Radio Shack. It can store 10 laps. I like it because it's large, has
big buttons, and has a two line display. One line always displays the
current lap, the other line always displays the previous lap. It also
displays which lap you're on. When you stop the timer you can review
all the laps. It's been durable, easy to use, and cheap!

The other watch is a Casio wristwatch. It can store up to 50 laps.
It works well, but is not as nice as the Radio Shack because it only
has one display. When you time a lap, the lap is displayed for like
5 seconds, then the current running lap time is displayed. After you
stop timing, you can recall all the lap times. The buttons are small
and hard to press. One nice feature is that it time and date stamps 
the laps. It was $25 at a Casio store, and does make a great watch.

What are the rules pertaining to a lightened flywheel on an F class 911. I
assume from the rule book that it is not allowed but would appreciate
clarification.
