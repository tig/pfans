I read with interest the recent posting regarding Kuhmos verses BFG 
R1's.  I have been running both and found both tires to have merit.  
The Kuhmos last a lot longer than the R1's and the lap times are 
about the same.  So the price/performance on Kuhmos is good.  The car 
set up required for the two tires are very different, which is why I 
am selling a set of Kuhmos.  This is an opportunity to try Kuhmos for 
a very low price.  
Tire size is 225/50/16 and 245/45/16 with two of each available.  One 
each of the 225 and 245 are in very good condition with about 1 hour 
of drivers ed on them.  The other two have multiple events, but have 
enough left for at least one drivers ed.  Price for all 4 is $225 
shipping included.
