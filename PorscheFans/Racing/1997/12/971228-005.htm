The HP and weight figures you quote are out of the PCA racing rules I
assume.  They are the same as the owners manual for my F class 84 Carrera.
If you are going racing these are not guidelines at least in the weight
department.  You must make those weights at all times when competing.  My
car weighs close to the 2670 weight you mention.  I must start all sessions
with near a full tank of gas to be assured of making weight.  Horsepower
figures depend on where you are reading.  For my car the 200 is right out of
the owners manual but I get readings of 199 at the rear wheels with a B&B
and air filter only.  My car is not the most powerful in class by a long
shot.  I have been out-dragged in several situation where corner exit speed
was not a factor.  There is at least 1 SC in G class from up north that
could pull me by 5 car lengths on the straight at Memphis.  All HP is not
created equal.  Don't worry about it .  Have fun.
