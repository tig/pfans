I believe that I attended the race that Walter Fricke spoke of when the pole
sitter lost a wheel before he crossed the start line on the first lap.
Texas world speedway in the GT-1 class?  anyway, when rebuilding engines,
you mentioned the stretch in the bolts, anti seize,  etc. had been covered
in a thread several months or a year back in the 911 page.  Since
porschefans has an archive system, could you give an approximate time frame
so that I might look it up.  Thanks.

Can someone explain this rule to me? (used in PCA club racing too).
Are the factory lug nuts unsafe or is it just to make sure
people are not screwing factory lug nuts on only 1 or 2 turns
due to spacers?

Also if anyone has any decent (good for a year or 2)
performance shocks/struts to fit an '87 924S for a
17 year old friend's 1st Porsche could you let me know?
He got the car (a nice one!) for $1900 so doesn't want to
spend $500 on shocks.
