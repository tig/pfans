Hi 

I'm looking in to buying tires for my 911 track car which I just finished. 
I do not have much experience in racing.  I had taken the Bondurant
four-day high-performance driving school about six months ago.  I am
looking for 245/45/16 the rear and 225/50/16 for the front. I will be
driving the car to events.  Although this will only  be 25 to 30 miles each
way. I have to considering two types of tires, BFG R1 and Yokohama A032R.

First which tire brand would be better for me, being a novice at racing.  I
am looking for the longer life and not necessarily the grip because I'm not
expecting to be very competitive just starting out.  At also like to get
good feedback from the tire, like when it is about to let go.

Has anyone tried the already heats cycle BFG R1 from Tire Rack?  It seems
like it would be worth the $15 per tire that they charge.

Any other suggestions appreciated.
