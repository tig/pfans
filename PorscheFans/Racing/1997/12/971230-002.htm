   I don't know enough about SC's to make accusations about the legality of
the car but, I do know nough about *lines and apexes* and such to know it
was not amazing skill or track familiarity at Thunderhill that made Bob J.
fast. His lines were uhmm, uhhhh, less than the ideal and I have it on film.
What I also have on film is that the car is *STINKIN FAST* on the straights
and out of the corners and I am suggesting that if this car is the *best
example* of a *LEGAL* and properly prepared *G* car then it should be
reclassed to E. If it is not legal then it should get legal.

   IMNSHO cars should be classed for their potential under the configuration
the car would run if prepared to the full extent the rules will allow and
not just at the level *most* competitors prepare their car to.

BOB (scotty b if it doesn't affect how much my family loves me, their health
or  the means with which I support them........ well, it just couldn't be
that important, now could it? ;-) white)
