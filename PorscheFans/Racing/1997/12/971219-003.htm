I have 3 different styles of the 3.8 litre RS wing for sale they are
fiberglass/carbon fiber.

1st I have 2 of the standard 3.8l wing which is great for racing with a single
turbo or a normally aspirated car I am asking $895 plus shipping.

2nd I have 2 thats are for a Turbo car that has a large intercooler or for a
twin turbo. I am asking $995 for this wing.

3rd I have 2 that are the same as the GT2 racers from Porsche they are like
the #2 more for a car with a larger intercooler or a twin turbo but it has
the 2 triangled air inlets on the sides. I am asking 1295. plus shipping.

All 6 of these tails are brand new never mounted or painted. I currently run
one of my #2's since I have a twin turbo car.

All are factory 6 position wings that replace the stock deck lids.

If interested contact me at     saphy@gte.net
