Steve:

I have heard (second hand), of a supposedly "rebuilt" engine from Kempton,
not seeming to be so.  I learned of this after having a VERY bad experience
with him (thankfully on a much lower cost item).  

I've often wondered how he can afford to keep putting full page ads in Pano
and Excellence with the attitude he displayed to me and the bad stories
I've heard.

Maybe some people have had good experiences??  I sure wouldn't even think
of calling him for anything!

Have had very good experience with 944 Ecology and pretty good experience
with Oklahoma Foreign (had one part charged $10 more than quoted over
phone, but resolved satisfactorily).
