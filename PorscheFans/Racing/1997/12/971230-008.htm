Scotty, having ridden in that SC at a DE event, and having the same type of
car, set up by the same mechanics, (one of whom drives the teddy bear car
when his kid doesn't) I can tell you that the car doesn't have anymore grunt
then any other SC.  I'd bet my title card that in a flat acceleration run
itisn't any faster, I'm that sure. the fact that he ran in more PCA Club
RAces then any other racer in the program last year, plus ran vintage, DE
and has abou t30 years of driving experience under his belt doesn't hurt either.

by the way, the old geek is a heck of a hockey player also, regularly
competing with kids twenty to thiry years younger then he is and more then
holding his own.  And you can't cheat on the engine in that arena.  I'd
suggest that we all take this a little less serious and have fun and maybe
admit that occasionally there is someone who can do something better then we
can.  Best Wishes for the New Year from sunny Minnesota -Bruce Boeder
