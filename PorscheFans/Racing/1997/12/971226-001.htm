Merry Christmas All,

A couple of questions.

The first is for a friend.  He is a Mech Engr and is searching for the common grading of the steel tubing used in roll cages that is refered to as "NASCAR Cage Tubing" (His caps, not mine.)  Does anybody out there know wha this is?

The second is a question that came to mind while reading all the questions & answers about PCA Club rules.  I have a 1967 911 running with a stock 1969 S motor.  The interior has been stripped to bare (rusty) metal and all side windows and frames removed.  A roll cage has been bolted/welded in and I have a plastic racing seat with a five point harness.  The ignition system will be a MDS by spring.  The oil system will be  modified as well by then to eliminate cavitation (don't want to burn out a second motor).  The flywheel is lightened and the torsion bars and sway bars have been beefed up and the car lowered.  

I've finally reached the point where I cannot spend any more money and have to actually drive the thing.  In order to get significant seat time this upcoming year, I'm expanding my horizons (beyond vintage) to include PCA DE and racing events.  What class do I run in?

The third question is about alignment & weight balancing.  Several months ago, someone posted an e-mail on how to calculate the weight on each tire using graph paper, etc.  I miss-placed the email.  Does anybody have a copy or know the date?  Also, has anyone come up with a simple way to build lever arms so the bathroom scale can be used?

By the way, if you have Costco/Price Clubs in your area, stop by and look for the ulimate Porsche coffee table book.  I got one from my wife for Christmas.  Either by weight or area, this book is the king of the hill.  It has 3~5 pages of description & pictures on every Porsche built up through the 1996 993 TT.  The only jarring note is that Boxster is miss-spelled in the table of contents.  On the other hand, it only cost $25.

Happy Porsching in the New Year!
