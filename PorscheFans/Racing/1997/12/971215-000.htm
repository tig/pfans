VERY disappointing!  I know many people from around here who were
planning to attend that event.  Any word on what this means for the club
race at the parade in '99?

I just got off the phone with the region president - Please note that
Rennsport had decided NOT to hold a club race on these dates, or at all
this year <sigh>.

Rennsport *is* planning to hold Driver Education events at
Mont-Tremblant
on: June 13/14, July 11/12, August 8/9, and September 12/13.

Oh well. Hopefully Mosport (sponsored by UCR) is still on.

Cheers,

hoping for an event at the Glen...
