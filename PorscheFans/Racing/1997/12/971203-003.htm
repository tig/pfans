Howdy,

First, I was wrong the heater core is there.  The under dash plumbing is
gone, so I assumed...I was wrong.

Second, the dash in our second car has been replaced and does pass tech.
It is not my car so I don't know the fine details, but it DOES PASS TECH.

But, I want to point out that it isn't very nice to send me threatening
messages about cheating.  Anyone who knows Bill Robertson knows that cheat
isn't a work in his vocabulary.  He won the ITC chapionchip with his skill
and a VERY well prepared car, period.  He is active in his 962 as well, so
many of you may have met him at PCA events. 

Anyway, I am not an SCCA expert, and I thought I made some valid
observations, I am sorry it I was weong about the heater core, but some of
the replies were out of line.
