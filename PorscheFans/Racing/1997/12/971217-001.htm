    You recently said....

    ...sorry to say but all you said is true in club racing.....it is =
    the old $$$$rules...what I have done is just put it down as the most
    fun = for the $$$ and know I really can't compete...ie sell the house
    and all = that....my racing buddy and I have started to look in to the
    SCCA spec = racer as this is as the rules go all the same car...
    John Hora=20 jhora@vocalink.com

    I did spec racers for awhile and do not think they are the answer for
    the following reasons...

    (1) It isn't cheap anymore.  Since the SCCA has mandated the Ford
    engine conversion (which noone but Ford and the SCCA wanted...read
    $$$$$$), it costs over $20K for a competative regional car.  I have
    also heard that the Ford engines are going soft after a few races.
    Many people also thought the Renault cars handled better and lasted
    longer.

    (2) The cars are not that stock anymore.  Penske race shocks (big
    $$$$) and other modifications are now allowed on Spec racers.  They
    deviate more from stock every year.

    (3) The field is really crowded and there is a ton of contact.  I have
    found there is generally less respect for the race cars and many more
    accidents.

    (4) The SCCA.  They could take efficiency lessions from the Post
    Office (no flames please).  You will have MUCH, MUCH less track time
    than with PCA.

    PCA is not perfect but after trying many different forms of racing...I
    think it is the best.

    Happy Holidays
