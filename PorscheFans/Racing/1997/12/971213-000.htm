About nine months ago, I purchased a completely rebuilt engine from
Kempton for my  944 Turbo S.  The car was  both street driven and used
for driver=92s ed.  From the very beginning, I noted that under load and
acceleration, the car blew clouds of thick black smoke and accelerated
poorly. Also, on at least  two occasions, oil was noted to be splattered
all over the engine compartment. The mechanic who installed the engine
thought  that the engine oil spray was due to a loose filler cap, and
then later due to a loose oil line. The black smoke and poor
acceleration under load were attributed to the Autothority chip. I was
told that the chip =93tends to make the engine run rich=94. This went on =
for
seven or eight months; running acceptably on my short drives to work,=20
but unable to complete even one single day of driver=92s ed.=20

Finally, I took the car to another mechanic who felt that the symptoms
were suggestive of a problem in the cylinder head. As predicted, the
=93leak down=94 was way out of spec. So, with about 2500 miles on the =93=
new
engine=94, the head was pulled. The exhaust valve guides were found to be
markedly distorted, very worn and a factor of 10 out of  spec!.  This
opinion is shared by 4 or 5 highly qualified Houston area mechanics. The
prevailing opinion is that these were probably old valve guides and bad
from the =93get go=94, and that they were never replaced when the engine =
was
=93rebuilt=94 by Kempton. Another possibility is that they were new, but
=93pounded in=94 and installed improperly.

At any rate, Robert Kempton claims that the car was =93raced=94  (though
when I wanted to race the Club Race,  it still wasn=92t running well
enough under acceleration to compete!).  Furthermore, he claims that I
did not have a Kempton representative present at the time the cylinder
head was pulled from the engine (despite the fact that it was pulled by
one of the most well-known and well-respected Porsche shops here in the
Houston area... German Autohaus).  Finally, Kempton states that the
engine was (by the time the correct diagnosis was made)  three months
out of warranty. It seems obvious (at least to me) that the problematic
valve guides were present from the inception of this project, though
incorrectly attributed to other causes. (BTW, with the new valve guides
in place, the car runs great, and a leak down test done by an
independent shop was within factory specs!)=20

The Kempton brochure advertises =93all new valve guides=94 in this engine=
,
and it is reasonable to have expected this in a completely rebuilt
engine at a cost of nearly $4,500.00 (not to mention the incredible cost
of labor to do the R and R!).  Am I whining?  Do I have any recourse
against Kempton?  Has anyone else had any similar experiences purchasing
things from Kempton?  Steve =93crying in my Exxon 93/Mobil 1 martini=94
