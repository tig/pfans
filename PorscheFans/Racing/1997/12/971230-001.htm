It is stinkin' fast and is extremely well driven by Bob Johnson and son
Erik.  And, it is legal.  It's been checked numerous times.  (They've
just been waiting for someone to demand a tear down to prove it, once
and for all...)  Best race of the rained out Sears weekend was between
Bob J in the SC and Mark "S-Cookie" in his GT5.  2 unbelievably great
drivers, 2 perfectly set up cars.  A thing of beauty to watch.

(who readily acknowledges superior skill behind the wheel; but who did
out qualify Bob J at Memphis.  My life was complete at that point.
'Course I was driving a GT2 car, and Bob was in the SC, but hey!  Lap
time is lap time!)
