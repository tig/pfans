Just a clarification --
Non-S Turbos are supposed to run in class E if they have a modified DME chip,
but that doesn't give them anything near a 50 hp advantage over a Turbo S.
Only a modified KLR (boost) chip and a boost bolt, wastegate shim, etc. would
give that kind of a hp increase, and that sort of modification is not allowed
in any stock  class (it may be done, but it's not allowed).
Good luck and have fun with your racing.
