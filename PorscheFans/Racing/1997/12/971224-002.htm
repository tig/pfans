Manny Alban asks:

Hi gang,
Well, my 90 911C2 is quicking being prepped for the upcoming club
racing
season.  I just have a few questions about certain modifications and if
they
can be done.

1.  Interior.  I replaced both drivers and passenger seats with racing
seats
so that both five point harnesses can be used.  I imagine that's ok.  I also
have removed the folding part of my rear seats.  Is that ok?  I am thinking
of
changing my door panels to the RS America type.  I don't know if that's
legal
or not.  I just hope the stock panels don't affect the installation of the
autopower roll cage that I will be installing.

2.  Suspension.  I've just sold one of my other cars and have some
available
cash to significantly upgrade the suspension.  Can I install a Cup Car
setup?

3.  Windshield.  I've just cracked my windshield for the second time in
less
than six months.  Both times at Bridgehampton. Any negatives with a
Lexan vs.
glass windshield.  The crack is about 8" long that originates from the
dash on
up.  Would that fail Tech?

Manny - you desparately need a copy of the RULES.  That is the only
way a person can go about "building" a race car.  You are the one who
will be held responsible at impound.  It would be nice if the rules were at
some web-site, but they aren't.  From what I can tell by nosing around,
they are not apt to appear officially on the PCA site any time soon.  And
no one with a web site has decided to do the typing to put them on as a
service to the club racing public.  So we limp along with only printed
rules (mine are in the race car trailer), although their content doesn't
change with the form.

Rule #1 for stock classes when you contemplate changes from
how car came from dealer is:  If the rules don't say that you can do it,
then you can't do it.

1) Rules say you can use any (suitable) seats, so you are OK there.  A
race seat (with big bolsters and strap slots in the right  places) is an
important safety feature, so rules actually encourage it.  Of course, rules
give a minimum post-race weight for your car without driver, but with the
addition of a cage you probably won't have a problem with weight just
because of lighter seats.  A point to consider.  You can add weight
(bolted in passenger side) if you need to. 

Rules say you can remove upholstery/trim as needed to install your roll
bar/cage.  So you can remove things which prevent metal to metal
mounting, for instance.  Unfortunately, usually you don't need to remove
the rear fold down seats to get a bar or cage in there, so you are stuck
with them.  Rules don't say you can take these seats out.  Since they
don't say you can, you can't.  I think Harry Hall even put out a warning on
that.  [I think we should be allowed to take the fold down part out, but
until rules change this is not legal.]

What to do about door panel interference with cage side bars is an
interesting issue.  Rules seem to me to allow you to remove door pockets
and whatnot if in the way of your cage.  Problem with switching to a
different system (RS America) is that is more like trying to make your car
over into an RS America.  Rules allow you to make your car into an RS
America if you want, but your C2 is in class F, isn't it, and the RS
America is in class D along with the Carrera Cup cars, so you'd have to
run in D.

Why don't you e-mail hhall@udel.edu about this door panel deal, and
share his response with us.

2) suspension:  you can change springs and change sway bars to get
stiffer or softer front/rear, whatever you want.  Use alternate shocks
(located same place as factory).  Replace rubber bushings with
polyurethane (or even steel spherical, it would seem).  Run any toe or
camber setting you can get without slotting, welding, machining.  If this
will get you to Cup Car specs, you can do it.  But you can't swap struts
or A arms (if they are different) or whatnot.  Since rules don't say you
can, . . . . .

3) I don't recall what rules say about Lexan windshields (allowed in the
GT classes if thick enough, I think), but you'll need help from someone
who has his rules book at his keyboard or a better memory.  I think not,
because this is a lightening item, which is contrary to stock rationale.  

I don't know about the 8" crack.  You make it appear like it already runs
from edge to edge in a corner, so it won't grow.  I wouldn't fail you, it is a
cosmetic item, since it is less than the distance between your pupils you
can always see around it, etc. but I'm not a club race scrutineer. 
Another thing to ask Harry about.

There is a short list of additional things you can do and you only have to
run up one class, and aren't kicked up into the GT classes.  If you do one
of them, you can do them all, so if you are going to max out that's what
you would want to do.  But you need the rules book for this.

Per the PCA website:  Any PCA member may receive a rule book and
licensing information at no cost by requesting these items from the PCA
Executive Office (703/922-9300), 9 a.m. - 4:30 p.m Monday - Friday. 
Last spring I read people saying they had asked but not received.  Hope
this isn't the case now.
