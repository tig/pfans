>> So, tell us about the race! How was it, how did you do? Anything
>> extraordinary? 

Okay Barry- here is the brief update on my first PCA race...

1. What a blast!
2. What a blast!!
3. I think I am hooked!!!
4. Nothing extraordinary (but lots of cars flatbedded back to the
paddock (fortunately not mine))

Seriously, it was a complete adrenaline rush.  After weeks trying to get
my car prepared, it all came down to the last evening before the race,
trying to put the suspension back together (I had the control arms
rebuilt, but the promised 48 hour turnaround really meant "I think we
can start working on them in 48 hours..."

Anyway, drove down to Savannah Thursday night (in my '89 Turbo - no
trailer/tow vehicle), washed the car and applied the numbers about
midnight.

Friday morning - test and tune.  Car feels great (it is completely stock
- as in original - as in no aftermarket performance parts except brake
pads), except my camber is so far off I am chewing up my tires, and it
doesn't look like they'll last even two days, much less through Sundays
race.  Other abnormality - excessive boost Friday morning.  The car has
stock chips, but seemed to have a problem with the cycling valve, and
developed WAY over 2 bar of boost a couple of times in the morning - now
I know what 400 hp feels like - what a kick!!!  Well, that problem never
repeated itself - too bad, I could have used the advantage!!!

Saturday morning I borrowed a camber gauge, and attempted my first
camber change at 8:00 in 30 degree weather - I basically guessed at the
adjustment, but the change was a dramatic improvement, and nothing later
fell off the car.  Bonus.

Now to the "racing".  Boy is this different from Drivers Schools!!  It's
one thing to drive fast around the track knowing you own the apex.  It's
quite another to attempt to drive around the track even faster, and find
out very late in the braking, that someone has a different definition of
"ahead" than was taught in the rookie drivers meeting!  Those turns are
a lot tougher when you not only can't hit the apex, but have to use a
few feet of grass for the exit.  Traction isn't quite the same.
Miraculously, I didn't spin (and learned two things: 1) my car has more
margin of error than I thought possible and 2) faster drivers get pissed
when you get in their way).  After getting yelled at in the bathroom by
the other driver (he also needed a little grass to stay away from
swapping paint) and realizing that everyone but the rookies thought they
owned the turn if their bumper was at your door, I was a little more at
ease.

I qualified respectably - turning my fastest lap time ever by about 1.5
seconds (a 1:24).  I passed a few cars during the race, and got passed
by a few more!  My adrenaline was pumping from the start (I love the
start, I love going down the straight, looking for a hole, then diving
into turn 1 three abreast!!!).

A lead car spun on lap 1, turn two - it was fun just driving through the
traffic at speed - you don't do that at Drivers Ed!  I passed a few cars
early - mostly on braking going into turn 1 (and mostly 911's, which
surprised me because I figured they would have the advantage on braking,
but I guess some of the 911 drivers like to take turn 1 slower so they
don't have to brake before turn 2?).  Then I had some open track.  My
lap times were nowhere near as fast as in qualifying, but working with
other cars was challenging (and thrilling).  I did slow down a few times
to give faster drivers a clear pass.  In doing so I let one or two guys
pass that I later come up on but couldn't repass.  Nice guys finish
last! Well, not quite last, but close enough!

Overall the weekend was a rush - I am anxiously awaiting the '98
schedule.  The people were all friendly, even the person (unnamed) who
yelled at me about getting in his way), and a great group of people.
Very supportive of the rookies too.  I would, however, like to make one
negative comment, and I guess this is as good a place as any (if anyone
is still reading this "brief" story).  The basic beef is about the
inability of cars to be competitive in truly STOCK trim.  I am just a
rookie, and in evenly matched cars would still have gotten waxed in the
race, BUT...  I feel that after a getting some experience and becoming
more competitive, I will be frustrated by the NEED to modify my car to
be competitive.  This is NOT good.  I, and others I spoke with this
weekend, would like to be able to drive their Porsche competitively
without throwing thousands of $$$'s at it, and without bending the rules
to stay in a stock class.

I originally headed down the club race trail because I had hoped their
would be a place for a stock car.  That is not the case.  Non- turbo-S
cars that have been chipped can run in E-class and have a 50 hp
advantage over an 89 turbo S.  Turbo S guys are changing DME chips, even
though it isn't allowed (although I spoke with two race shops who
claimed it is allowed to swap the DME- it clearly isn't unless you want
to move up a class).  9" wheels on the front were not uncommon.  Flowed
intake manifolds (not allowed in stock) were present, as a few drivers
pointed out.  Thousands of dollars have been spent on suspension mods to
be competitive.

This really isn't sour grapes - I finished close to last (if not last)
in my class, and that is where I would have been no matter how my car
was set up.  But the prospect of racing where the pocketbook rules in
stock class is a little disconcerting.  I would like to see a truly
"stock" class, similar to showroom stock (maybe brake pad changes or
tire choice...).  Maybe I should look to SCCA spec racer programs.

Again- the weekend was a tremendous success, too much fun, and I am
afraid of getting truly addicted and having to sell my house to stay in
the racing.  But have you seen the saying

I CAN LIVE IN MY CAR - YOU CAN'T RACE IN YOUR HOUSE

I would appreciate peoples comments, and hope I haven't offended anyone.
