The PCA National site has a section that allows you to send a message
to the executive office.  The address for this is:

http://www.pca.org/pca/about/general.cgi

I have already sent them a message with my comments about the club
racing rules online.  I'm not trying to rock the boat.  I only want to
voice my opinion on this subject.  If a majority of the members want
the rules online, then that is what should happen.

<<Anyone know which year this LeMans version of the 924 Carrera GT was?
Was this the 1981 GTP model? TIA>>

Wes:  I don't understand your question.  Are you asking which year the 924
with the 944 engine ran at LeMans?

In 1980 3 924 Turbos ran at LeMans, finishing 6, 12, and 13 overall although 2
had engine problems.

In 1981 there were two 924/944's at LeMans, the 924 GTR which finished 11th
overall and the 924 GTP which finished 7th.  The GTP was, of course, the turbo
944 type engined car.  

The following year BFG ran the 924 Group 4 cars to showcase their new road
tire technology.  These were 924 engined cars, one with British and one with
American drivers, in theory, and corresponding paint themes.  I think only one
finished and then replica versions were made, displayed, and sold of these
GTRs.
