Hi all,

Just received Monte's email. Since the Executive committee's position
is no web site, there is now no web site. I wasn't aware that PCA
doesn't 
want any club racing info available. There was an expression of need
as communicated by others and I responded to it. My desire was to
contribute to the club racing community as a new member. 

Club Racing is under the purview of the Executive Committee and they 
have a right to make decisions concerning it. If you as PCA members
think that decision is wrong or mis-guided, please speak up and let the
Exec Committee know. They work for you. 

As for the rules site, I'll still be happy to host a un-official site as
long as PCA approves. I'd be happy to make any disclaimers as needed.
Until then, thanks to everybody.

- Cris
