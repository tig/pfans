-- Question:  how long did you do DE?  At what point did you feel
confident to
-- club race?
-- Thanks,
-- Ted Arneson


Ted- 

I did my first driving school 12 years ago at Sebring (I was 18 and my
dad let me use his BMW), and did only two more before I was cut off.  I
started doing DE's again about 2 1/2 years ago, and have done about 12
since then, mostly BMW.  I bought my '89 951 in April of last year,
because at that point I saw racing in the future.  At that time I was
still using a borrowed car (an E30 or E36 M3).  I did some research as
to what would be a relatively inexpensive way to start club racing, and
settled on the '89 951 (over other Porsches and BMW's) because of big
brakes and solid handling from a stock car.  I felt like I wanted to
step up to racing soon after moving up to the advanced run groups of
DE's, or after getting caught in lots of traffic in the intermediate
groups.  Passing in the turns in DEs didn't seem like a good idea.

As an aside- I'll toss in my $.02 on the E30 thread that was raised a
few days ago.  They (E30's) are FANTASTIC cars.  They are very racy
(read peaky engines, quite light, and relatively easy to set up).  They
lack the torque of the new body style M3's (E36), but I have seen stock
E30's run circles around stock E36's and 944 Turbos on tight tracks.
Overall, they are excellent, well balanced cars, but not as well suited
for around town driving as is an E36 M3 or 944 Turbo.

Wouldn't it be neat to have a BMW Vs Porsche Club Race Challenge?!

Matt.

As for Kempton - a buddy of mine had to have MasterCard resolve his
dispute with Kempton (my friend won).  Kempton sold him a set of "like
new" takeoffs for a '96 993.  What he received was a set of scratched
rims that had paint runs on them.  Kempton said "that's what you get"
and wouldn't take them back.  So my friend stopped payment with MC and
they told Kempton to stuff it.  Moral - don't use Kempton, and ALWAYS
buy with a credit card - it is the ONLY way the consumer can hold any
power.
