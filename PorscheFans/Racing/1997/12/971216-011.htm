for the $$$ and know I really can't compete...ie sell the house and all =
that....my racing buddy and I have started to look in to the SCCA spec =
racer as this is as the rules go all the same car....hey look at it this =
way you have a nice 944T and how many of your friends can say they can =
drive their daily driver and race it at 100+mph on the weekend.....heck =
I have a lowly 914-4....don't drive the 944 8V on track...and the only =
thing that the 914 can pass in the straight is the pits...but I can beat =
anything in the curves...really...see it's really the fun not the =
competition....yeah right..that is why you bought your P-car right...

For many years I was a corner worker for IMSA and SCCA races in the
Southeastern US.  In 1979 I came into possession of a BBS modular racing wheel
and tire that had come off of Peter Gregg's 935 at the Daytona midnight race
on July 4th.  Eventually I made a coffee table, using the wheel & tire and a
40 x 40 sheet of half-inch scratch-resistant acrylic, with rounded corners and
polished edges.  This is RSA, or Rubber-Strengthened Acrylic, and to this day
does not have a single scratch on it.

I got married a year ago, and the decor in my living room has slowly evolved
from racing posters, car models, and piles of Road & Track to Matching-This-
and-That and glass and wrought iron tables and genuine framed prints and stuff
on the walls.  Alas, the Porsche coffee table must go.  I am asking $250,
which is pretty firm if I must pack it and ship it cross-country.  If you can
pick it up, we can talk.
