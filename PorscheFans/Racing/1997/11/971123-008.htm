Thanks to all for the advice on solid vs factory motor mounts
for track use.  Several people suggested I write Harry Hall for
clarification of what's legal for stock class.  I did and here's
his reply (w/permission):

 As far as I am concerned you can use any of the mounts.  If you use the
 solid ones, you will probably regret it.  There have been some strange
 part fractures from vibrational strains the rest of the stock engine
 mounting hardware was never meant to see.  We use the cab mounts on all
 stock cars, and non-stock crossbars, etc. with solid mounts on GT cars.

I also got the following from Steve Weiner at Rennsport Systems in OR:

   Just our input here about motor mounts. We use the Club Sport hard
 rubber mounts. They are cheap and work very well in stabilizing the
 engine/tran assembly and preventing the side-to-side torque reaction
 that creates the binding that make it hard to shift under load.

 Solid mounts do make a lot of noise and vibration and, in our opinion,
 aren't necessary for what you are doing. If you are running IMSA
 competition or FIA GT stuff, then the added stiffness in a 100% racing
 car might help. One would also need a full cage as well. The solid
 mounts do NOT stiffen the chassis, as some claim, since the engine
 mounts are outboard and to the rear of the suspension pickup points.
One
 would need bars that extend from the rear shock towers and cage, to the
 end of the car along the frame rails for those to be effective.

On the pro-solid mount front I heard a very successful stock class
911 is using them and felt they were necessary (I hope I paraphrased
that correctly..).  Not surprisingly, no easy answers....

Personally I'm going to go with the club sport mounts.  That is if I
can find enough spare time to drop my engine before spring.
