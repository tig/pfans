Hello Frederick,

Thanks for your comments. I have a few of my own.

Most definately.

What if your goal is to determine if racing is for you? I know that 
before I decided to go club racing, I thought long and hard (and long
and hard and long and hard and well, you get the idea...) about it.
I decided to give it a try, and if I liked it, then I would prepare
my car more for racing. However, there is a big initial cost in
preparing for your first club race.

From what I've heard (and been through) your experience is typical. 
Get a Porsche. Start in driver ed. Do more and more. Prepare the car
a little, decide to race, enjoy it, prepare the car a lot.

> Consider- Compromise track preparation will produce a compromise track car

Yes. However, what if you go all out, spend big bucks, then
decide that racing isn't for you? You're out all that time and effort.

> car will never be in its element. That is an important concept to grasp.

Yeah, you most likely aren't going to win a race unless your car is
prepped to the max. However, that doesn't mean you aren't going to
have a great time! This club race stuff is all about having fun, and
less about winning. You don't the super prepped car to have fun!
Hell, I did my two races knowing that I would be a back marker, and
I had a blast.

I understand about safety, and there really can't be any compromise
made there. However, I also know about cost. If you make this so
expensive, you will cut out a lot of the little guys (me). 

Perhaps there can be one set of safety requirements for people
with rookie / provisional licenses, and another for fully licensed
drivers. This way, the first timers can get their feet wet without
too many modifications / expenses, and if you decide this is for
you then you have to get all the safety gear. 

Specifically, how about the roll bar rule for first two races,
then roll cage requirement?
