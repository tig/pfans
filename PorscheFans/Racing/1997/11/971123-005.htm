Jeff Williams n2vxc@juno.com   Hi all,   I' ve got a couple of questions
that I need answered. I just  took the mech. fuel injection pump off my
1972 911 T and replaced it with a set of carbs. my question is how
exactly does the pump work. I understand the basic workings of the unit
but Im still confused as to how the unit
determines  when exactly to trigger each injector. obviously I know it
has something to do with the small belt that drives off the end of the
cam shaft, but in all of the books that i ve have read they say very
little about the unit much less how you would put the thing in correct
time. If any one  could tell me anything about it I would greatly
appreciated it.    Just out of curiosity but what would the complete
working assembly be worth $$$.
  One more thing, will either the type 954 short shifter #954.424.010.00
from the 911 SC  RS  mentioned in Bruce Andersons book or the factory
short shift kit offered by  Performance Products #911.424.931.00 work on
my 1972 911 with the 915 model tranny.                    Thanks to
anyone who can offer any information.....
