I don't have a single national lap record. Actually, I've never run a
national race, just IT. Personally, at least in Cendiv, you can have a lot
of great competition with a lot of drivers who would do very well nationally
if they felt like going through the hassle. Until SCCA changes it's attitude
about Porsches on a national level (i.e. classes them fairly and allows
modern FI cars in general into production and GT) I will continue to run in IT.

>i have never driven this car in a porsche club race. however, my crew
>(avg. age 70)does enjoy that privilege. 

To bad, they can be a lot of fun.

>years.......

Nope, never gone, never will. In 96 when I won the Cendiv championship, my
fastest time at Road Atlanta was in the high 42's. Since the Datsuns  and
Mazda's were turning 38's, I didn't see the point. I have never driven the
track with the chicane, so I can not compare myself to this years times.
Just as a point of interest, Price Cobb ran my car at Atlanta, during a test
day with Kelly Moss. The fastest he turned was a 41. So basically, an ITS
944 can not be competative against equally well prepared and driven 240Z's,
280Z's and RZ-7's when you are on long "horsepower" type track.

The concept of the AARC being a potention "national" IT championship is
laughable as long as IT cars are "not guaranteed to be competative" by SCCA
when they are classed. Obviously you feel somewhat the same way, since you
are selling your 944 and thinking about getting into an RX-7. I would do the
same thing if I was not having fun on the short tracks.

>P.S. would you sell your car as a slow it/s car or fast i/stock car?

I would sell it as a competative ITS car (because it is at the right tracks)
and a fast H prepared car, since it is in no way legal for I (as my car is not)

I'll be at the Sebring PCA race in February. If you still have the car and
can make the trip, come out and run with me. It should be a lot of fun.
