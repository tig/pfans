Paul:

As I've said a number of times here on the list, and as all the 
helmet manufacturers say in their literature, the NUMBER ONE rule for 
properly sizing a helmet is:

    There should be ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that you can remove a buckled
    helmet by reaching behind your head and pulling the thing
    forward.  If you can remove the helmet this way, it's too big and
    NOT SAFE.

Properly-fitted, properly-buckled helmets will not come off your 
head no matter WHAT hits them.
