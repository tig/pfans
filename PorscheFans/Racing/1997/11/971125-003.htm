In a message dated 97-11-25 09:21:46 EST, you write:

<< Looks like you have a potential for oversteer with your chassis 
setup.
  You may be able to neutral balance the car with the anti-roll bars
 but  I couldn't do it with a similar setup.  You really need to
 concentrate on the front end of a 951, this is the problem with the
 car after all <grin>.   You will still have too much weight transfer 
 with 250 lb. springs, no matter how big the anti-roll bar is (you 
will
 just have more chance of cracking the control arms where the swaybar 
 attaches).   If the car is to be setup for racing, and you must 
retain
 the torsion bar at the rear as the only springing, then use a 30mm
 effective rate bar on the rear with 500 lb. springs on the front. >>

Q. Where do I get 500 lb. springs?  I have Koni Yellows on the front.
 Non-height adjustable.  All I've found is 200, 210 and 250 lb. 
springs.

A. You can get "slide over your existing shock" threaded sleeve 
adapters from Carrara.  I suggest Hyperco springs.  Or you can replace 
the existing shocks with a threaded body shock (Koni or Penske).

  << Make sure you have sufficient rebound damping for this heavy 
spring,
 and go relatively light on the anti-roll bars (23mm/19-21mm effective 
 rate).  This will give you a neutral car that corners flat but still 
 handles bumps well.  Incidentially, you will need to optimize the
 toe/camber for the tires you plan to use as well as precision weight 
 balance the car for this to work properly.  >>

Q. Can corner balancing be done without height adjustable struts?

A. You can use shims under the springs with the factory non-adjustable 
struts, and change the rear ride height with the spring plate 
adjusters, or the spline on the torsion bar in extreme cases.

Q. What do you recommend for camber and toe?

A. Depends on the tire and wheel combination.  If you have the 
aforementioned springs installed (500/400 or 500/30mm) and you are 
using Hoosiers (the best performance/price combination for "pure 
racing")  you will have good results with:
Front Camber -3
	Front Toe +1/8"
	Rear Camber -2.7
	Rear Toe 0"

<< 245/45/16 IS the best setup for a car with stock horsepower.  Run 
8x16/9x16
wheels with more track in the front than the rear (1/2 - 1 " 
difference is
good).  This will provide better turn in and reduce/eliminate 
understeer with the
 aforementioned spring/bar changes.  It should go without saying that 
 the suspension bushings should be solid/plastic as required, 
INCLUDING
 the rear subframe.
 Good Luck!

Thanks again!  I won't continue to harass you after this one!
