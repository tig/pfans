Just a couple of quick responses to two posts.

I have a RaceTec in my 951, as do several friends.  All of us have the top
half of the rear seat back removed, as it does interfere with the cage.  The
rules allow for that removal, if it interferes with the cage [as it does].
I don't think I have seen any 944 variation of  PCA club racer with a full
cage and the top half of the rear seat installed.  You should be fine [the
seat back ways about 35 pounds, so it helps offset the 90 pounds or so the
cage weighs].  I think the RaceTec is a good choice, above the Autopower,
although not as extensive [or expensive!] as some of the "Matter" [sp?]
styled cages that Porsche installed their Cup Cars.

On the Turbo S considering Big Reds up front -- Steve Meltzer posted:

The big calipers will move you up a class. If you do "chip" your car, you
can do both and only progress the one class [from E to D].  You can only
"Chip" the DME chip, not the KLR chip that effects boost however.  This is
probably NOT a competitive move from a car class perspective.  They won't
buy you much in terms of Class D.

Good luck whatever you decide.
