Longacre is a good source for the high temp hose.
The air ducts that attach to the hub can be purchased from OG Racing 
(they are included in the "cool brake" kit, but can usually be bought 
separately).
Looks like you have a potential for oversteer with your chassis setup. 
 You may be able to neutral balance the car with the anti-roll bars 
but  I couldn't do it with a similar setup.  You really need to 
concentrate on the front end of a 951, this is the problem with the 
car after all <grin>.   You will still have too much weight transfer 
with 250 lb. springs, no matter how big the anti-roll bar is (you will 
just have more chance of cracking the control arms where the swaybar 
attaches).   If the car is to be setup for racing, and you must retain 
the torsion bar at the rear as the only springing, then use a 30mm 
effective rate bar on the rear with 500 lb. springs on the front. 
 Make sure you have sufficient rebound damping for this heavy spring, 
and go relatively light on the anti-roll bars (23mm/19-21mm effective 
rate).  This will give you a neutral car that corners flat but still 
handles bumps well.  Incidentially, you will need to optimize the 
toe/camber for the tires you plan to use as well as precision weight 
balance the car for this to work properly.  245/45/16 IS the best 
setup for a car with stock horsepower.  Run 8x16/9x16 wheels with more 
track in the front than the rear (1/2 - 1 " difference is good).  This 
will provide better turn in and reduce/eliminate understeer with the 
aforementioned spring/bar changes.  It should go without saying that 
the suspension bushings should be solid/plastic as required, INCLUDING 
the rear subframe.
Good Luck!

Hi Chris-

Saw your post on the PorscheFans Racing list.  Could you tell me a 
little
more about the brake cooling setup you described.

Specifically, you mention running 3" hose from the air duct to the 
cool brake
distribution duct.  Do you know of a source for these?  How bout the 
air
ducts?

Also, after seeing the website, I can't resist asking for some an 
opinion.
 Looks like you're involved in racing.

I'm just setting up my '87 951 this winter, for racing next summer. 
 I've got
250lb. Weltmeister springs for the front and 29mm torsion bars for the 
rear.
 30mm hollow Porsche sway bar for front, 22mm adj. Welt bar for rear.
 Question:  Does this look like an oversteer setup to you?  (I'd like 
to run
245's on all four corners, 16" rims)

I rode with a friend who had (or said he had) this setup, and his car 
handled
extremely well on the track.  Since ordering the parts, however, I've 
seen
info. that leads me to think 27 or 28mm torsion bars may yield a more 
neutral
setup.  Any thoughts?

TIA,
Jeff Fortenbery
