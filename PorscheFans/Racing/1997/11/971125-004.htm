Keith,

Great post on a subject near and dear to me!!!!

>> Jeff, sorry to here that you got rid of your MFI to move back to the old
carburetor technology.  ...  All of the great race
motors of the 70's had MFI (2.5ST, 2.7RS, 2.8/3.0 RSR, IROC, SCRS, 924GTR
<<

Don't forget the 935s running MFI with their turbos.

>>  Back in the 70's in  a
national SCCA solo competition a "T" beat the "E's,  S's" and every one
else for the gold.<<

Yes, E.Paul Dickinson had a great string of 4 wins (followed
by a string of 3 wins by the 2.4S of  John Fergus) and Greg
Fordahl won once in the late 80s in a T. But from '85 to
'90 the fastest car was a certain '72 S  (2 wins, 2 seconds) ;-).
And one win in a 911E by King Thompson was in there too to 
round out the 2.4 911 trio.

>> PS. Any other MFI hints, set up tricks or knowledge out their?  Has any
one
ground their own cam? Is any one boring out the plastic 2.4 T / E stacks 
to
36mm for S or RS conversions? What is the HP limit of a 2.4 pump?  Can it
fuel a 3.6 350+ hp motor w the right space cam? How about a high speed
"stepper motor" to control the pump?  <<

Bob Spindel, Jeff Shorey and I used an o2 sensor that Bob made
which clamped on to your muffler output to set your MFI.
It was interesting to use. I can forward the info that we got if you are
interested.

I'm trying to get info on making an RS engine which is basically the
same as the 2.4S (heads, injection) I think. 
Does anyone know if the E injection
(stacks and bodies) is the same as the S? How about the heads,
is there a difference in the T E and S? It is SO MUCH easier
to find a 2.4T engine for cheap...

Regards, Mike Piera  '72 911S, '73 RS clone?????
