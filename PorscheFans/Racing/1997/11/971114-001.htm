Subject: rain tires

Recently at a Club Race and a DE, I discovered that the tires I have chosen
to use as rain tires, (Dunlop D40s), were horrible in the rain. Does anybody
have recommendations on a good DOT rain tire that is reasonably priced? I am
not interested in dry traction with this tire. I have R1s for that purpose.

Hello P-Fans
	I have found Bridgestone RE-71's to be the best rain tire out there.
Bridgestones S0-2's are probably even better - but I haven't used them yet.
The Bridgestones give plenty of warning when they approach their limit. They
kind of feel like an eraser skipping on a piece of paper. The Yok
AVS-intermediates - Suck in the rain & snow! Ditto for the Yok A-509's. I do
Agree that the Dunlap D40--M2 are kind of scary in the rain. But are a decent
cheap-o tire overall. 
									Good Luck, davidjalai@aol.com
