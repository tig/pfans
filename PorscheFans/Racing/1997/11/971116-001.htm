Greetings from down under folks,

I currently drive a '89 944 S2 in our club 'Supersprint' events.  I guess
the closest way of describing these to my US counterparts is circuit lap
dashes.  The format is usually that you get one warm up lap and then three
laps of the circuit (we have four major circuits in and around Sydney) in
which to set your best time.  You usually get 4 - 5 'runs' on any day of
competition.  Some of the competitions run timed 'sessions'.  This is where
you will get a 15 min session during which you try to set you fastest lap.
Not unlike qualifying.  

So as you can see, the car is really doing stuff that is closer to circuit
racing than to autocrossing. Tracks vary in shape, size, bumpiness, hills
etc.

We are getting to close to the end of our club season and I am thinking of
making some changes for next year and was hoping to get some experiences
from you folks.  Not necessarily about my car in particular (although I
would love to hear from anyone who races a 951) but concepts in general.  I
have read lots of literature on the subject of suspension set up and I have
been driving on the current set-up for about a year and a half so I know
where the limitations of the set-up are. 

I am currently running double adjustable shocks and coil overs front and
rear.  I have linear rate springs, standard anti-roll bars and the torsion
bars in the rear are still active (kind of a 'dual rate' set-up but it also
allows me to take the track springs out and put the car back to road spec
very quickly). The car is lowered 25mm at the front and 20mm at the back.

I am thinking of running an Eibach dual spring set-up next year and wanted
to see if anyone has any experience with this sort of set up as opposed to a
progressive spring set up.  The car sits very well with the set-up that I
have although there are some spots on the circuits where the car is perhaps
a little too stiff (bumps in slow speed corners).  So my plan was to run (I
have 10 inch height springs in the front) a fairly soft (say 200lb) 2inch
spring coupled with a pretty stiff 450-500 lb 8inch spring.  This should
keep the tyres compliant in the slow corners while providing the required
control on the faster corners and under heavy braking. Should I also be
thinking about changing the size of the anti-roll bars at the same time?

I would welcome any experiences discussion on this.

Thanks in advance

Azim
