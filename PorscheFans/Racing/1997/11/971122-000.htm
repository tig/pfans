<< I'm thinking of buying a set OZ Racing Fittalpaldi "Star" wheels for the
 track. They are used, but in excellent condition (8 and 10X17) for my
 944TS. I couldn't see a TUV stamp on them, but I find it hard to believe
 that they aren't.Maybe I don't know what I am looking for. The seller
 has the orig purchase papers from The Tire Rack. Does anyone know if
 they're OK, or have any experience with them? TIA steve meltzer  '88
 944TS, Zermatt Silver, resurrected, mechanic wannabe, Mac Believer <G>.

I have a pair of these wheels in 10X17 that I use as spares for my Kinesis
10X17's. They are very high quality and with my spring set up, fit the front
as well as the back of my 1988 944TS. 

I purchased these wheels from the Tire Rack as a closeout special. I got a
great deal on them and would have bought more if they were available. Just
remember that these wheels are discountinued and repairs are not likely.

If you want to know any more please email me direct.
