Hi Guys

Last summer I managed to set FTD at a very wet autocross using Goodyear
Eagle GS-C's, I was using these as my Toyo Proxes RA-1 (a motorsport
tire) were too worn to use in the wet. I would recommend using either as
the Toyo's come with 7/32nds of tread when new and are an IT rain tire.
They are priced similarly to the BFG R1's.
The times seem to show the GS-C's as being pretty good too.
I've heard the Goodyear Eagle F1 is supposed to be very good in the wet
but I've never tried them.
