Thanks to all who posted with advice and information about lowering my
'89 951 and recommendations for control arms.  The car is lowered about
1/2" (I think) and I have sent the control arms to Dynamic Euro Tech for
rebuild.  I'll post the results.

New QUESTION: I have installed an electrical cut-off switch next to the
battery and run a pull cord to the driver side (used shielded bike cable
and works very nicely).  I haven't yet WIRED the switch.  It is one of
the OMP(?) switches with a capacitor to keep from damaging the
alternator...  Other wires are supposed to run to the coil and from and
to the battery positive terminal.  Two questions: 1) can anyone tell me
a good/the right way to wire this thing?  I don't speak Italian and the
English isn't real clear.  2)  My positive leads running to the battery
comprises about 7 wires and is a glob that would be about 2 inches in
diameter.  What and how do I attach to the cutoff switch?  How do I
splice these wires?

TIA, I am going to try to do this over the weekend.  Monday night is
seat installation, Tuesday night is window net night, and Thursday is
reinstall control arms.  Friday is mount the fire extinguisher (anybody
know of a source for Phoenix mechanical valves so I can use a stubby
bottle instead of a long thin bottle?).  That leaves the weekend to iron
out problems, or maybe even get the car off jack stands and drive it!!
My first race is the following week, so I still have to bleed brakes...,
and try to remember how to drive!
