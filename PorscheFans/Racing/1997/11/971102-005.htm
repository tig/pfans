I have a 72 911T with which I would like to have the engine modified to 
"S"
specs and begin PCA racing in 1999. (I have much more to learn in 98, 
more
drivers ed's, etc.) My question is regarding the class my car will fall
into. The standard 72 9llT is in the "I" class and the 72 911S is in the
"F" class. Will the modifications to a 2.4 liter engine move my car into
GT-4, which I don't want, or if the engine modifications stricktly 
follow
the formate of the original 72 2.4 S engine will it be in "F" class?

Thanks,
Thad, ARPCA

Thad, if you only change the engine to the specs of a 72 S, (and if a 
previous owner hasn't added a few things that could take it out of the 
production classes) it will be classified as a Production car.   

Consider staying with the engine as it now is and running in I for a 
season or so.  You'll likely have more than enough other things to do to 
get a competitive car (suspension, driving technique, exhaust, 
engine cooling, etc) to eat up your time and budget.  I  would 
suggest that you not change the engine until you have to rebuild it, or 
start winning in I class.  I ran my 73T in I class for awhile until the 
engine failed and I had to rebuild.  That's normally a large class, and 
I bet you'll be surprised at how competitive those pesky 914 2.0's and 
944's can be, especially on short twisty tracks.  

Another thing to consider is that F class is normally dominated by early 
944T's and 3.2 Carrera's.  I don't recall seeing any 2.4S club 
racers (I'm sure there are some), and wonder how competitive a 2.4S 
would be. You might want to run a season or two before committing the 
dollars to upgrading to 2.4S specs, during which you can solicit the 
expert opinions of others as to whether a 2.4S is likely to be a good F 
car.

If you've already decided, there is a forum member who bought a GT4S 
with a 2.4 engine, who is planning to upgrade to a 2.7 or 2.8.  Maybe 
he'd sell you his entire engine and rebuild yours, or perhaps there is 
some other area for mutual interest.  If you post a notice, he'll likely 
respond.  I don't recall his name right now.  

Just my 2 cents worth.
