Josh Halder wonders if he can get a deal on Weltmeisters better than
Automotion's price, and the List gives advice, including suggesting
having a bar made, which at first glance seems like it would cost more,
not less.  Josh explains that he already has the peripherals, and just
wants to put in a larger bar.

Maybe Automotion/Weltmeister would sell you just the bar?  Can't hurt to
ask.  My dealings with them have always left me feeling pretty good
about them.

Perhaps contact Ronald J. Podhajsky for ideas?  He made his own front
(and rear!) bars.  See his post on the 911 list of Nov 3, 1997.  He bought
bar material from Aircraft Spruce for about $30.  His bars were smaller,
but maybe they sell larger stock also.  For the front, I don't suppose a
machinist would charge all that much to mill the needed flats on a bar
(assuming that the arm from the smaller bar can be made to work on the
larger bar - perhaps end of the arm needs some work also?).  That
leaves bushings, and the question of whether the bushings for a 22mm
bar can be fit into the housing for a 19mm bar.   However, you can get
the Weltmeister bushings separately if you want to use that kind of
bushing.  You should be able to put a 22mm bushing in the housing
where a 19mm one resided (a pretty good guess, I think, as why would
they want to make housings in so many different sizes if they could just
make one size to fit all and let the bushing do the adjusting).   You have
about a $320 break even budget, no?  (cost of Weltmeister 22mm front
bar with all the fixins).
