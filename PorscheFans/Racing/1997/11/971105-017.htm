Yes, they will sell just the bar. For about $70 I believe. I was hoping
to find it cheaper than that.

The arms will work on either the 19mm or 22mm bar.

Yup. Just the bushings and the bar are all I need. The larger ID
bushings will still fit in the housing.

The front bar is just one of the few things that are going into the car
this month. 21mm hollow torsion bars (already on the way), 200lb rear
coils (poking around for the best source), 22mm front sway bar and
bushings (my search for sumthin' cheaper than automashin'), and some
race compound A-arm bushings (probably same source as wherever I get the
sway bar bushings). And I think I can get all of the above for under
$300. The trick is, how _much_ under $300 I can do it. Every penny
counts in the car account, I'm saving up for a set of lightweight 3pc
15x9 wheels. Problem is, not too many manufacturers will do a 4x130 bolt
pattern.
