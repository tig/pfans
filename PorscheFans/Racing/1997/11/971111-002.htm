[snip] discussion of the possibility of airbags removing helmets.

I think that main point here is the airbag issue. Wheather the helmets
were removed by the airbag deployment is a secondary issue in my
opinion. From what I`ve gathered about airbags in drivers ed events and
other high speed track events, is that they are potentially more of a
hazarard than a help. Here's my reasoning on this. A track is designed
(if it's well done) to have ample recovery room on the exit of most
turns. The idea being that the driver can then have time to get the car
corrected before hitting something. However, this recovery can still
entail alot of heavy bouncing around, and the possibility of the airbag
going off is getting high at that point,even if you don't hit the armco.
The problem with the airbags, when it deploys, it's like someone tossed
a stun grenade into your car. -BANG-! Make no bones about it, it _is_ an
explosion. And not only will the concusion of the blast stun you for a
few seconds or more, but the bag itself, when it deploys, will force
your hands from the steering wheel. I have read more than a few accounts
where an otherwise minor bump at speed (i.e. a fender graze on the
freeway) easilly becomes a major accident because control of teh car is
taken away from the driver.

So, my personal opinion is that airbags should be dissabled when on the
track. You can all dissagree with me, and I welcome any aguments to the
contrary.
