Andy Warren responded:

<<As I've said a number of times here on the list, and as all the 
helmet manufacturers say in their literature, the NUMBER ONE rule for 
properly sizing a helmet is:

    There should be ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that you can remove a buckled
    helmet by reaching behind your head and pulling the thing
    forward.  If you can remove the helmet this way, it's too big and
    NOT SAFE.

Properly-fitted, properly-buckled helmets will not come off your 
head no matter WHAT hits them.>>

Hi Andy,

I have two helmets - a Simpson Bandit M85 and a Bell M2 SA95. I tried
your test and found that the Simpson Bandit would indeed come right off
with little effort while the Bell M2 probably would not come off without
removing my jaw. 

I think you hit the nail on the head with your response!

Paul
