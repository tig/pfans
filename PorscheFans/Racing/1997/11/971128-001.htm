<<I care! Please post what you can regarding rules for running a 951 in
ITE. I
was told by the local region that the 1998 GCR's will not be out for a
month.
I am in the process of building a cage for my PCA GT-2S 951, and want to
make
sure I have a SCCA legal cage. BTW, do you know if the SCCA has weight
mimimums for ITE? Are cars in ITE supposed to run on spec width rims, or
spec
tire sizes/ brands? What is the spec for interiors?>>

Hi Steve,

ITE is not one of the 'official' SCCA IT regional classes so the exact
rules are a bit vague. ITE is only run in certain regions and is
typically a home for DOT-tire-production-based cars that were prepared
for other racing series. Here in the Northeast the fast cars are
apparently completely stripped Corvettes that are almost full-blown GT
cars. I think most if not all ITE groups allow welded in roll cages
becuase most of these cars were built that way. As you can imagine that
pretty much leaves winning to whomever has the largest wallet.

The GCR is not going to change much from year to year and your cage
builder will be well acquainted with it along with any recent changes. 

'Real' IT cars allow carpeting and sound deadening to be removed, but
they require most of the original components such as the heater system
to remain in place. And they do not allow welded in cages. But I
wouldn't worry too much about 'real' IT rules because the turbo cars
will _never_ be allowed to play in one of the 'real' classes. The SCCA
decided in the early 90s they could not enforce the cheating that can
occur with turbo cars so they banned them from all official classes.

Since you run with the POC I'll guess you live in the LA area. I do not
believe any of the SCCA regions in your area support ITE. But give 'em a
call and bug them. There is also another sanctioning group on the West
Coast you can try but I cannot remember the name. Apparently they are
growing larger and larger as the SCCA continues to shoot itself in the
foot. I hope they run out of bullets real soon now.

Paul Foster
