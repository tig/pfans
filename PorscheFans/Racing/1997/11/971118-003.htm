That's very likely. Don't discount improper ignition however. That can
have a huge impact on throttle response.

Yes, and unless there's a specific reason why you need/want the original
FI, I would recomend going to a quality aftermarket FI system

Reasons why one would install the D-jet in favor of a more modern
system:

1: Concourse car, must be original.
2: CA (or similar state) smog laws requiring original (if archaic) FI.
3: Competition rules that forbid modifying factory fuel, ignition or
induction.
4: Don't want to deal with the hassle of adapting, installing, and
tuning a system that wasn't specifically designed for that application.
5: Costs can be in excess of D-jet. Some just a little, others a whole
lot. It all depends on the system.

Actually, $1500 sounds alright, but what does that include? Injectors?
Fuel Pump? Throttle Body(ies)? All of these are usually an added cost to
a DFI system. If you're going to get a system that cost upwards of $1500
to $2000, then seriously consider getting one that has programable fuel
_and_ ignition maps. For that kind of money, you might as well get all
you can.

I plan to upgrade to a DFI sometime in teh next year or two. My rules
allow for any fuel, ignition or intake setups. Currently my two top
choices are the ACCELL DFI, and the HALTECH system. There are others
sure, SDS is a simple plug-'n-play system, but doesn't have the
versitility of high resolution mapping. The Electromotive is good, and
has been proven quite capable, but has lower resolution and has been
known to be problematic. Then there's MoTec. The big dog, for people
with big bucks that they don't mind reducing to little ones. MoTec is
still considered the hot stuff in the programable FI department, but is
very costly compared to the rest. Is it wort it? I honestly don't know.
 
> Does anyone have any expiriences with this type of after market FI?

Not the one you're refering to I don't think. But like I said, there are
alot to choose froom. Choose wisely.
