Scott has a point here. R1's have a kindof weird behavior in that tire
pressure changes to effect grip don't work like other R tires. However,
the problem comes up in that too many people take that to mean they can
run extreem pressures to get what they want. No, you can't bleed the
tires down to next to neothing and get ideal grip. The R1 sidewall is so
stiff that it can support the weight of the car, but will fold over
under heavy loading. What happened alot when the R1s came out was that
people, in the belief that lower pressures were better, were running
them _really_ low and were then frustrated with the rapid demise of the
tire (EGOD). One of the BFG guys explained some of this to me. The R1 at
very low pressure may very will _feel_ stickier, what you're feeling is
the contact patch rolling over to the sidewall, and tehn the sudden
break in grip is when too little of the tread is left on the ground and
the sidewall can't hold you anymore. Where the tire flexed was where
this "groove" happened to show up. The R1 at 'normal' pressures will
behave much more predicatble and much less like the "grip and slip" tire
it was called when it first came out.

Set up BFGs with tire temps. That is really the best telling way for
these tires. If you don't have a tire pyrometer, then use your hand. Or
your friends hand if the tires are REALLY hot. ;)
