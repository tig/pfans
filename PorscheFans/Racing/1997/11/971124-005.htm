*****
I don't think we are really supposed to figure it out! After reading what
limmited info I could find and taking one of my pumps apart at least 5
times for a little "reverse" engineering,  I believe the following to be
close enough to being right.

PLUNGERS: The fuel that is pushed to the injectors is delivered by plunge=
rs
that are pushed up by a cam with six lobes that are timed to the motor. (=
At
apx. 225psi, wow!)

RACK: The amount of fuel delivered per stroke is changed by a geared rack
that runs between the "V" of the plungers. This rotates the barrels of th=
e
plungers which have ramps built in to them. The position of the ramps
changes where the supply orifice is cut off and intern meters how much fu=
el
will be delivered on each stroke.

FUEL QUANTITY:  Throttle and RPM are the primary determinate of how much
fuel is delivered.  As the throttle is opened the rack is moved calling f=
or
more fuel. As the RPM increases more squirts of fuel per time are
delivered.  In a race motor this is about all that was necessary and used=
..=20
However, in a street motor other factors were required to "modify" the fu=
el
delivery to account for changes in environment and drive-ability.

MODIFIERS: There are three main sub systems that modify the quantity of
fuel delivered.  These are all tied to the position of the rack. Altitude
is compensated for by the can on top of the pump. This is a precision
device so "never pick up the pump by this".  The other is a thermostat th=
at
receives heat form the exhaust. (keep it clean & if you take it all of th=
e
way apart you will never get it back right)  The last and most interestin=
g
is the "space cam".    (There is also a fuel cutoff solenoid  that dose n=
ot
really modify or adjust but helps with emissions)

SPACE CAM: Many refer to this as a "three dimensional cam". This implies
that it is like a hard version of a three dimensional EFI or Motronic map.
I prefer to think of the space cam as 3 separate cams:  idle, cruse and
race. The choice of these is controlled by a rotating weight governor.=20
When the throttle is advanced the cam rotates and a stylist riding on it =
is
moved up or down to lean or richen the mixture.  As the RPM is increased
the stylist goes from one cam (or level of the cam) to the next to
compensate for the expected load and condition. This change in position i=
s
effected by a rotating weight governor that has a three stage spring syst=
em
in it. As the RPMs increases the governor pushes against  the springs and
moves the stylist up to the next cam (or stage of the space cam).

At idle the stylist is on the top of a lobe on the first "idle" cam.  As
soon as the throttle is depressed a little it falls off of the top of the
cam lobe thus increasing the fuel quality for acceleration.  As cruse spe=
ed
is maintained the stylist is again at the top of a lobe on the "cruse cam=
".
 If the throttle is advanced some the stylist again falls off the lobe an=
d
increases the mixture. At high RPMs the govener moves the stylist to the
third part of the space cam, or  "race cam" section.  This part of the ca=
m
keeps the stylist in a rich portion in all throttle positions except for =
a
fully closed throttle position which moves the stylist back to the top of=
 a
lobe or lean position. =20

So - if you "floor" the throttle from idle, the stylist immediately falls
off the lobe of the idle portion of the space cam and because the throttl=
e
is all the way open stays at full rich past the "cruse" portion of the ca=
m
and on to the "race" portion of the cam.=20

If you close the throttle at 7,000 rpm, the stylist goes to full lean at
the base of the race or high RPM portion of the cam and stays lean at the
base of the "cruse" portion of the cam and continues to stay lean on to t=
he
"idle" portion of the cam. =20

Jeff, sorry to here that you got rid of your MFI to move back to the old
carburetor technology.  The factory went to MFI for more power and better
emissions.  In fact the 2.4 euro carb version only had 130 hp compaired t=
o
140 hp for the USA MFI version of the same motor.  All of the great race
motors of the 70's had MFI (2.5ST, 2.7RS, 2.8/3.0 RSR, IROC, SCRS, 924GTR=
=85)
 The only reason most of the 914-6GT's did not have them is that they wou=
ld
have had to cut a hole in the firewall for adjustments.

If I were you I would SELL THE CARBS! (some other misguided sole, or a
well-guided racer with a custom cam and non factory motor setup, will pay
big bucks for them!)  Have the pump rebuilt and injectors cleaned (about
$600) and set it up right (clean stacks & good tune). The 2.4 stacks shou=
ld
not need rebuilding like the early ones unless they have big miles on the=
m
(when the motor is cold, carefully spray starter fluid on the shafts to
check, - at your own risk) =20

In fact, add a K&N air filter and add a second outlet to the right side o=
f
your exhaust (tell the pump builder you are doing so) and get about 155 h=
p
instead of the 130 with the carbs and stock exhaust.  Back in the 70's in=
 a
national SCCA solo competition a "T" beat the "E's,  S's" and every one
else for the gold.  (Oh -  you also won't have to worry about starving th=
e
motor in the big corners as the fuel runs out of the floats on those
Webbers) =20

Jeff, you also wanted to know how much for your old MFI set up. I have se=
en
them advertise the T system for up to $400. I paid $40 for the last set I
bought including the pump.=20

Happy trails . . .

Keith P.
72-911T (2.8 / MFI / twin plug)  =20

PS. Any other MFI hints, set up tricks or knowledge out their?  Has any o=
ne
ground their own cam? Is any one boring out the plastic 2.4 T / E stacks =
to
36mm for S or RS conversions? What is the HP limit of a 2.4 pump?  Can it
fuel a 3.6 350+ hp motor w the right space cam? How about a high speed
"stepper motor" to control the pump?  . . . =20
