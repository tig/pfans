I want to warn everybody that there may be a danger with airbag
deployment removing helmets, particularly closed-face helmets.

In October at a PCA drivers ed event at Watkins Glen, an instructor with
a student in a nearly new stock 993 spun in the inner loop and shot
across the exit to hit the outside Armco and tires at nearly 100 mph.
The tires did their job and the car was shot 4 or 5 feet into the air
and backwards where it came to rest shiny side up in the middle of the
track. The airbags deployed and apparently removed the closed face
helmets from the heads of both occupants. The passenger's hemlet was
found on the other side of the Armco. Both were using standard 3-point
belts. The force of the collision caused the driver's stock carbon
kevlar seat to bend clockwise 20 degrees. Both were transported to the
local hospital and released after being examined.

I can only speculate that this was not an incident of carelessness
involving not having the chin strap on securely since it affected both
occupants. I think the airbag came in contact with the chin portion of
the helmet and forced it downwards which made the back of the helmet
ride up and off the head.
