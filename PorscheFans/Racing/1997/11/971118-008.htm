<< I tried a set of Hawk Blue 9012 pads at the Road Atlanta Driver's Ed last
 weekend on my 944 Turbo S.  They stopped fine, but after the event, I found
 that the face of the pads were riddled with cracks.  Is this typical?  Am I
 doomed to a new set of pads for each weekend?
  >>

I have used the same set of  Hawk Blues on my 944 Turbo S for 8 track days (4
at Watkins Glen and 4 at Lime Rock), and they have a few days left in them.
 A pattern of small fissures is apparent on the face of the pad, but they
still work fine -- no problems with crumbling or deterioration.  For
comparison, I had been using Cool Carbons and Kool Kevlars (or something like
that) with success on my n/a 85.5 944, but they didn't stand up well to the
higher speeds of the Turbo S.  The Hawks seem to be tougher on the rotors,
though.
