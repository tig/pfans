Dear Joe Rothman:

Ref: Quaife...
I sure hope PCA backs off their draconian Quaife ruling. A reputable local
shop has a lot of experience with various LSD's and they noted no appreciable
performance advantage as you have also noted. They are much more reliable in
the long run and less expensive than a new factory unit.  I have one because
POC allows them but with an otherwise PCA - E  class car I have to run in
PCA's GT3 - ya right!

Ref: Recaro seats...
I need to find someone in SoCal that can repair a KRXT (? I think that's what
it is ?). Can you recommend someone? The threaded nut that is located
internally in the rail
has busted off so I can't screw in the mounting bolt.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
