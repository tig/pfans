Ross, all the Team T/A data I have seen says your "rule of thumb" is
incorrect for R1's. They are backwards. To increase grip, lower the
pressure.

The reason you see so many points of view is that the tire works well in a
variety of situations. On a 911SC, a car I have immense experience with,
the pressures I quoted and the recommendations I gave just plain work. You
can run even lower pressures (as low as 20 psi) and sometimes I do. The
only problem here is the "groove of doom" becomes more likely when you
run real low pressures. The biggest issue will the R1 is getting it hot
enough to work at its best. If I can't get them hot enough at 25 psi, I
lower the pressure. The tires never roll over so that is not a concern.
