Dear Jerry Mouton:
Thanks for the reference link 
(http://www.research.digital.com/CRL/personal/hawe/bfgtires.html)
I'll be sure to check it out. 

Having worked closely with Yokohama and now being sponsored by Hoosier I have
a lot of tire expertise. However, I indeed am not a user of BFG R-1's and yet
I do have  Team T/A written performance data and tire/suspension guidelines
and it too suggests the same basic "rule of thumb" as I relayed in my
posting. 

If I am incorrect then so be it - this forum is good for debate and
discussion of this sort making it possible for us all to become the wiser - I
can certainly admit to being wrong.

It is interesting to read and hear all of the different points of view
regarding the R-1's. I don't know of any tire with as diverse an amount of
recommended setup variations. More pressure vs. less pressure, a little
negative camber vs.lots of negative camber - it's all over the map. The tire
pressures Mr. Winders noted are on the lower side compared to those that my
compadres here in SoCal are running therefore I assumed (oh yes I do assume
on occasion) it would be highly unlikely that adding pressure at these
pressures would reduce traction.  But then as you noted, and I am fully aware
of the tire construction, it has a lot to do with how much negative camber is
dialed into the suspension since the pressure does affect the tire's built in
camber affect. I actuallly should have asked the original concerned party the
specifics of his suspension and its settings before making any
recommendations at all.  I have read a lot of BFG factory reports that too
many users are running their pressures too low and I have noticed that the
camber settings are getting more negative dialed in and the pressures are
coming up with them.  

Best regards,
Ross
