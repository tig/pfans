 Hi Bill:
 
 For sure for sure!  A 951 cannot be in ITA or ITS.  Only ITE(verything) if
 allowed in your region.  Typical ITS cars in addition to the '83-88 NA 944,
 are: 240,260,280Z's, 2nd Gen RX7.  ITA includes 924, 1st Gen. RX7, and a
 slew of Jap cars like CRX's.  If anyone really cares, let me know and I'll
 post.  (Don't have my GCR here today).  
 
I care! Please post what you can regarding rules for running a 951 in ITE. I
was told by the local region that the 1998 GCR's will not be out for a month.
I am in the process of building a cage for my PCA GT-2S 951, and want to make
sure I have a SCCA legal cage. BTW, do you know if the SCCA has weight
mimimums for ITE? Are cars in ITE supposed to run on spec width rims, or spec
tire sizes/ brands? What is the spec for interiors?  

Any help would be appreciated. 

Regarding 951 front springs, Chris' advice on front springs is right on the
mark. The 951/944 needs lots of help to reduce inherent understeer.  250lb
springs are really  street springs. I think anything more than stock T bars
in the back requires at least 350lb. front springs.  I run 550lb fronts.

With all this talk about springs, be sure to get some sort of camber
plate/spherical bearing for the upper strut mount. The camber loss from stock
strut mounts works against any improvements made with bars, springs or
struts. IMHO, This is the first step to getting the car to stick and making
front tire wear bearable.

Best of luck,
