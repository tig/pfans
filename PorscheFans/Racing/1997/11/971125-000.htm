Hi all-

I've got new suspension components scattered all over my garage floor,
awaiting installation.  Now I'm having second thoughts about the setup.

I decided on the front and rear spring rates after riding w/ a friend in his
race-prepped '86 951.  (Mine is an '87 951).  He said was running 250 lb/in
springs w/ 29mm torsion bars.  30mm Porsche hollow sway bar
up front and 19mm 3-hole adjustable in the rear.  His car handled
beautifully!

Now that I've begged, borrowed and stolen most of the parts, I'm wondering if
the 29mm torsion bars are gonna be a bit stiff, leading to oversteer.
 Everything I've seen would suggest 27 or 28mm t-bars coupled w/ 250 lb/in
springs would be the better balanced setup.  What's the consensus among those
w/ similar set-ups?    (I've also got the 30mm hollow Porsche bar up front,
but a 22mm adj. Weltmeister in the rear.)

I'm planning on using the car exclusively (almost) on the track.  I don't
want to loose the wonderfully "neutral" handling of the car.  Ideally, I'd
like to have the car neutral enough that I can "dial in" a bit of oversteer
or understeer via the adjustable sway bar in the rear.

TIA for your opinions,
Jeff Fortenbery
'87 951 (at age 41, I never thought I'd worry about being too stiff!)
