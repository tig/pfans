The idea though is that I already have the arms and drop links, I don't
need those, just the bar and bushings. I also think I might just have a
bar cut from a steel rod. But I havn't figured out machining costs yet.

That'd be way cool. But also very expensive. I'm trying to save money,
not burn it. :) I already have a plan for some custom fab work that will
be mucho expensive. Beacause my class rules do not allow me to reinforce
the railing arms, but do all the use of 'traction aiding devices' I
figure a can get a dual watts linkage fabriacted to prevent any flexing
of the trailing arms. But this project is down the road a ways, I'm not
ready to sink that much time and money into that particular goodie yet.
