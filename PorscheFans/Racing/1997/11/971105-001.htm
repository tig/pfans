This bounced so I'm trying again.

Agreed.  But here's my slant on it.  I mentioned that initial cost is
important which is why I'm not considering any of the bigger p-cars.
I can get a solid Rx7 with a fresh motor for less than three grand
(quite a bit less actually), that's not a trackster but gives me a decent
starting point and I can start driving right away.  Three grand is about
the starting point for a 914 1.7 that passes the big butt test, with a
tired motor -- most of the $2000 914s I've seen are rusted in half!

That said, if I could find a big-buttable 1.7 with a decent engine and
chassis for around $2000, I'm there.  But after several months of
casual looking I think I'm living in a dream world.

Sorry.  I should've mentioned that the 911 is a street car only, meaning
autocross and driver's ed is as far as I'll take it.  Hell, it already
costs me too much which is the reason for the budget.  But you'll
have to pry my cold dead fingers from the steering wheel!
