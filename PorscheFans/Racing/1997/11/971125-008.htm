Walt, thanks for the pat on the back!

**********
 
You're right, unless you build a motor to factory specifications there is
not really a MFI pump that will match.

However, I believe that even if we get close it should be as accurate as
most carb set ups. (over rich idle jets, slot mod's, building dams.... To
much for me to figure out!).

Getting the right space-cam for a non factory motor setup is a challenge. 

I believe the 2.7 RS space cam was also used in the 3.O RS; a 9% increase
in size. So there may be precedent for space cams to span different motor
displacements.

The early factory race systems did not have "space-cams" to adjust for idle
and freeway cycles. Just RPM and throttle position.

Furthermore, it is my guess that Porsche designed the factory space-cam's
by trial and error in the 60's; before computers. 

I am just finishing my motor and I am starting with a 2.4S pump and factory
plastic 36mm stacks. My motor is a 2.8 with non-factory Elgin high lift S
cams. As the 2.4S is a little peaky - I hope that the basic shape of the S
power curve will match of my Elgin's personality close enough to start.   

If a 2.8 is 20% bigger than a 2.4"S".  I will need to richen the pump 20%
by adjusting the rack. This would give me (190HPx120%=) 228 HP. The 2.4 is
8.5 compression ratio and the 2.8 is 10.5. This should give me about a 10%
boost in power with out adding any fuel (228HP x 110%=) thus 250 HP. I will
estimate another 10hp for the efficiency of the twin plug for 260 hp, again
- no more fuel required. 

A 2.8 twin plug motor with webbers and factory S cams was dynoed in Up
Fixing at 255 hp, so I think I am close. 

Any increase from the sport exhaust will be a bonus and will require
further fattening of the pump to match the increased air flow. ( A
performance exhaust can through off a factory MFI setup.)  

What I hope to do is set my pump up per factory specs on a dyno for cruise,
calibrate my dash mount O2 sensor to this, and then if necessary "shave" my
space-cam on the high RPM  part and the "off lobe" or "cruise" part of the
cam for more fuel at mid and high RPM full acceleration. (Tuning with a
file?) 

This is not a daily driver so I am mostly interested in not having a lean
condition in the 3000 to 7200 RPM range in track conditions.  

Will this work?

If it dose not, I plan to have the pump built as a 2.7 RS  and I will
fatten it up a little on the dyno if necessary. 

There is a guy out here that has a 3.5 MFI high butterfly 914-6 that is
wickedly fast. The factory never made a pump for this combo either,  but
that does not slow him down... . 

Don't wake me up, I'm still dreaming.

PS.   Any one been successful using a "non-factory"  MFI combination?
        What is the HP limit for the 2.4 pump w just a Space-cam change?
        Any "Tricks of the trade"?
