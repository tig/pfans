Hi,


  Just wanted to thank everyone that replied about the MFI,  It is sold
by the way.  I was wondering if anybody has had any machine work done by
Motor Meister out in California.  If any body has please let me know what
you thought about his work.  I am considering buying some pistons from
him and I'm told he can create any comp ratio I would like.  With the
excellent gas quality (HA HA) here in NY I was wondering what would be
the highest compressions ratio my engine would tolerate on pump gas?  If
any one would care to share there experience on this subject I would
greatly appreciated it.                                                  
                              Thanks......
