Truth in tire setup is truly elusive, as the previous comments on this
subject have shown.

For those still interested, see Grassroots Motorsports 1996; 13:54-58,
Sept/Oct.  Mike Kraemer wrote a good reference on radial DOT race tires that
addresses many issues regarding temps, pyrometers, and pressure. He makes
some enlightening comments about starting and ending pressures, shaving, and
pyrometer readings.  

His bottom line:
1. Uniform temperature across the tread only applies to bias-ply tires.
2. Temperatures tell you how much camber is dialed in, but don't help in
knowing  whether pressure is right.
3. Infrared pyrometers are only good for dynamic readings (on the track with
telemetry).  Did anyone notice the 60 degree temperature range on Doc
Bundy's right rear tire at Laguna Seca this weekend over 150 yards on the track.
4.  If your tires go away 6 laps into a club race, you probably started with
pressures too low, rather than too high as most of us would claim. (Too low
at the start means tire flexes too much early on, heats up too much, and
loses grip.  Properly inflated, the temperature doesn't rise as much, so
grip lasts longer)

With regard to R1's, Jim Fogarty (from BFG) wrote a dissertation on "Care
and Feeding of Your BFG R1's" in 1995 in which he recommended lowering the
pressure in the tire at the end that is sliding to improve stick - obviously
the converse of conventional wisdom .  He also gave recommended cold
starting pressures for a 2500-3000 pound rear wheel drive car of 34F/32R,
and work down from there.
