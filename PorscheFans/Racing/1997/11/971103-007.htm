H'lo pfans
This is probably the wrong forum to ask, but here goes nuttin'.  I'm
planning on buying a car this winter that will be semi-street, good
autocrosser.  The goal here is SCCA Solo II and maybe (more on this in a
minute) PCA autocrossing starting in the spring.  Ideally I'd like a car
that will make a competitive autocrosser (eventually, given the hack behind
the wheel) that can also be taken into road racing a year or two down the
road.  This car will be improved slowly as the driver improves, and
definitely on a budget.

My two personal favs:  Porsche 914 (of course), and Mazda Rx-7.  Both can
be excellent autocrossers, BUT...

the 914 will be expensive to make into a good roadrunner, though I know
there's quite a few who have done it, and the Rx-7 is well...not a Porsche!
I also think that it won't take as much to "move along" the Rx-7 as it will
the 914.  Am I wrong?  I'm also fighting the fact that I had an Rx-7 a few
years ago and I really miss it.  Great car!  But then I've always wanted a
914.

but...
but...
but...

You get the picture.  Anyone want to help a poor lost soul?
TIA
Mark
