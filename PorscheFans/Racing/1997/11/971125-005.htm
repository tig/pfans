Not true. if your car is STOCK as class E, then you can run it in PREPARED,
up one class to class D.

If it is a stock F car, and is in E due to some other reason (a chip, etc.)
than it is already considered PREPARED. Put in the Quaife and have fun.

You can take ALL of the prepared modifications and still run in prepared.
They do not accrue points the way  POC modifications do (or at least I think
they do.)

I agree that running in GT class in a stock engined car is a bummer.
