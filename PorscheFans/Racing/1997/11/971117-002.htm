    Hi gang,

    I spent a good part of my Sunday at Midwest Eurosport's (my race prep
    shop) open house.  It was a PCA tech session with incredible food
    (pasta and sweets) and several interesting demonstrations.

    Of most interest was the demonstration of their new Engine Dyno.  The
    dyno system is basically a two room operation. In one room, the engine
    and induction system is hooked up to a permanent setup for testing
    engines (i.e. oil tank, ignition system, serious exhaust venting, gas
    feed, etc.). The second room has a computer hookup to various parts of
    the engine and a glass window to watch the engine perform.  It was like
    a video gain.  You could control most of the engines functions from the
    room. The operator reved the engine from idle to redline. The monitor
    displayed RPMs like a tach, had fuel mixture by cylinder, torque
    readings at various RPMs and more.

    They were testing a stock 3.0 liter 911 Carrera Engine with 60,000
    miles. The engine made about 5 HP short of what it left the factory at
    (however the ambient temperature of the outside air being pumped in was
    around 30 degrees which should be good for a few extra HP).

    Then they purposely mistuned the engine timing.  This lost another
    roughly another 10 HP.  Then they took off one spark plug wire lost
    another 15 or 20 HP.

    Finally, they retuned the engine to standard specs and added a K and N
    air filter system to see what real effect it had on HP.  It added 2.5
    HP, far less than the 8% they quote in their advertisements.

    I guess the moral of the story is that most used engines will get the
    most HP benefits from being in top tune.  If your motor is 10 HP out of
    tune adding a bunch of aftermarket devices might not be the best
    immediate use of funds.

    Overall, the dyno was amazing.  A trained user can make various
    adjustments and see what the real outcome is.  i.e. do performance
    chips really work, does your machine shop really know how to modify
    heads, etc.  It is also interesting to see how broad your torque curve
    is.  So many race motors produce great HP but are really peaky.
    I am going to dyno my 2.4 911 race engine before and after I upgrade it
    to a full blown 2.7.  I will keep you posted on the results.
