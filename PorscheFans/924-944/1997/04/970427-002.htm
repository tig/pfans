Those are driving lights, not fog lights.

I would hear with a European wrecker or something, but they can be hard to
find on the web. Even I, a European, have to shop from the USA.. :(

Another thing about the Euro bumper - it has a downwards slope instead of
being square like the US ones. Fits better with the curve of the hood, and
makes the car look much better. If you get to it, why not replace the rear
bumper as well? It has a single small rubber stripe along the whole bumper
instead of those big clunky things you have in the US.
