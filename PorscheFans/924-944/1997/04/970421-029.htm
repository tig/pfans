Hello Porsche People, 

	I need some help.  I have a 1985.5 944. 115k miles. The car is in
perfect shape. Or was. I have had it only about 4 months. Today on the
way to work something weird happened. I was driving down the freeway at
70mph and all of the sudden my car started to make a noise like a rattle
comming from under the hood.  Kinda like a hole in the muffler. It felt
like it was right in front of my feet.  When this happen the car also
started vibrating. I drove the car another mile after the noise started.
It got louder. It kinda sounds like my muffler fell off but the sound is
in the front of the car. Now when I start my car I hear a rattling like
a tin can from under the hood on the drivers side.  It sounds like it is
comming from the bottom of the car.   I know this description is not
real clear but does anyone have a idea what this might be? Is this
systematic of a timming belt breaking ? Does anyone know a good Porsche
mechanic in Dallas Texas or Fort Worth ? It did not seem like I lost any
power but it vibrates and rattles pretty loud.  It is defininetly one of
those sounds that will make you not drive any further. 

P.S. - Bought car from old lady who decided she did not like such a
small car. The records were not kept up on the car.
