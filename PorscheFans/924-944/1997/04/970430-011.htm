I'm hardly running a 951, but I think you'll get the same response from
many of them.  I'm currently using Mobil 1, and although I'm not as crazy
about it as some people on the list, I *have* noticed a mild performance
increase (very mild) and it seems to be doing a better job at keeping the
engine temperature down than regular oils.  Especially on these warm
spring/summer days, I find it very useful.

The only downside is that it screws up my oil pressure reading, presumably
because the oil reacts differently to temperatures.  Oh, right!  It also
warms up much faster.  It's usually warmed up all the way about a minute
of driving the car.  (Other oils took as long as five minutes, and on one
extremely cold day, it took about seven.)

As for viscosity: I've been forced to use whatever I can get,
unfortunately.  I guess Porsche owners in the area really eat the stuff
up.  Ideally, I'd probably use 20W50 this late in the game, but 10W30 will
do (although I don't like it).

Hope that does you some good.  This might do more: I switched to Mobil 1
after a bunch of people on the list suggested it.  Most people that I've
seen use 10W30 or 20W50, unless I have a serious memory problem.  Since
every 951 owner on the globe is a member of this list...
