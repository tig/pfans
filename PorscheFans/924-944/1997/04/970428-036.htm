On Fri, 4/18/97, Colby J Leonard (shyone@sprintmail.com) asked about the
brake light staying on for anything other than the e-brake - sometimes
flickers on and off.
When I had my first P-car, a 1983 944, I had the same problem sometimes.  I
found that the bracket holding the microswitch under the e-brake handle had
somehow been bent downward a little, thereby not allowing the microswitch
to come into full contact with the e-brake handle in the "off" position,
and therefore not completely opening the contacts and breaking the circuit
for the "brakes" dash warning light.  Try bending the bracket up a little
until the e-brake handle completely depresses the microswitch button(you
should be able to hear the internal contacts "click" when opening and
closing.  Hope this helps.

Sorry I haven't been too active of late, but we've been having some trouble
with our Netscape Bridge at work, but I have been accessing the archives
when possible.
