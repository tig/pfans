Hello listmembers,
 Like many others here, I have experienced problems with the cruise control
on my '86 944 since I got it about 3 years ago. Surging speeds and losing
the preset speed were the most common failure modes. After checking out the
servo I bought a new brain (used). Great, it fixed it... for a while. Soon
afterwards the same symptoms developed, however intermittently. I decieded
to just live with it until I read here about the brake light bulbs. For
those who missed it, someone posted that on the 928 list the consensus was
non OEM brake light bulbs have a different resistance. When you cancel the
CC by using the brakes it zaps the brain. Well, I took this with a grain of
salt but I'm starting to believe it. I've been canceling the CC with the
stalk and it's working great. Ever since I started doing this it hasn't
malfunctioned one time. Another thing I did was to reinstall the stock
throttle cam. I believe that the CC brain is calibrated for the stock
throttle cam and the fast ones open up too quick. If anyone else has any
experience with this technique I'd like to hear about it.

Terry
'86 944

ps. Does anybody know where you can get German brake light bulbs?
