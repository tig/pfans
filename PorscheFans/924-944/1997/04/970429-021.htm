Ok Doug, I'll give it a shot.  The WOW (weight-on-wheels) method makes =
more sense to me.

Any thoughts as to how tight is too tight for the bearings?  The car is =
almost 10 years old and although it only has 54.5K miles, should I go =
ahead and re-pack the bearings anyway?

You know, this problem only appeared after I replaced the tires.  The =
car had Dunlop D40M2s on the front (the factory original Dunlops were on =
the rear), so I know the car 'likes' the tires.  I only really had to =
replace the rears, but I did all four.  I had problems with the shop =
that installed the tires. They tightened my balance shaft belt way too =
tight (whined like a turbine) and insisted something on the suspension =
was 'broken' and causing the 'wandering problem'.  Could they have =
loosened the bearings, maybe?  Always possible.  Anyhow they definitely =
didn't use a belt tension gauge and the Porsche dealer in Atlanta =
verified that there were no suspension problems.  Well after that =
experience I'll never let anyone work on my car except the dealer and =
me. =20

BTW, the Tire Rack recommended these jokers to mount my tires, and since =
they SEEMED to be the local Porsche experts, I let them replace my fuel =
filter and adjust the timing belt too.  They didn't even put new valve =
stems on the alloys (they were as old as the car), although the mounting =
and balancing job was OK.  The point is, ya'll get local word-of-mouth =
advice on repair shops before using them even for things as benign as =
tire mounting.

Thanx for all the help!

I don't think you can easily get enough force on the rotor to check the =
wheel
bearings properly (at least I can't but I don't lift as much as I used =
to).
What I do, with the wheels on the ground and loaded, is grab the top of =
the
tire and push/pull. Loose bearings will "clunk-clunk" and you'll have a =
pretty
good idea from the location of the noise if the bearing or the strut is =
the
source.

If you use a very sharp chisel you will not scar the hub, but some marks
are expected artifacts on the cars if they are more than a few years =
old.
At least it shows someone has cared enough to grease the bearings once =
in
awhile.

Give the bearings another check and see what happens. At least it'll =
give you
another data point.
