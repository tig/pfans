Hi Steve,

Did you do anything special with the alignment -- e.g. I'd expect
more front toe-in would make the steering stiffer and feel less
overboosted, but would that increase feedback from the tires?
Or did you just have the car set to factory standard spec.  I'm
surprised that tires make a difference -- any insight there?

From other list members:  I'd like to hear about alignment (4-wheel)
preferences/experience to set up the car for autocross on street
tires.  I'm thinking of buying Bridgestone SO-2 or SO-1.  Any other
suggestions.  (This is a Cabriolet and I've had some input that
the SO-1 improve the ride quality, and I'd like to get the car sticking
better for auto-X, esp. feel and turn-in response.  Am I fighting a  
loosing
battle against the Cab. body flex?  I hope not, she's so damn pretty
and I'd hate to give her up!)

I've currently got Goodrich Comp TA VR4 in front and Comp TA ZR in back.
The back had been VERY sensitive to throttle and brake-induced  
oversteer, but's
better since I dropped the back pressure from low 40s to mid 30s.
It's now at 36/36 front/rear.  Beyond that, I'd decided
the handling problems were COMPLETELY driver-induced, until I had  
an experienced (15yrs)
autocross instructor run a course in the car.  He took 4 seconds  
off my 47,
but completely missed a gate as the rear end broke out, and said  
"Gee, that's
squirely" when we got out of the car.  Granted, he's not experienced in
the 944, and I need LOTS MORE seat time -- but it seems I might get a bit
better grounding to start off with.

Finished whining ...
