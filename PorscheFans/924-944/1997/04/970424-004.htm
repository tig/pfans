I've got an '85 944 with 15" wheels. It's been on Pirelli P6s, 215HR60/15,
since I bought it. I've found them to give the best compromise between grip
and tire life for street use. The current P6s that are on the market are
made in USA, and have been redesigned as "all-season", with the same basic
tread design but wider circumferential "sipes", and slightly greater tread
block spacing. The P6 successor model imported from Italy by Pirelli is the
P6000, a noticeably different tire which I haven't used.

Alternatives for greater elan include the Goodrich Comp TA in 225VR50/15
(street version). This will raise your effective final drive ratio slightly,
since the diameter is just a bit smaller than the 60-series tires. Result
will be marginally better acceleration and marginally worse fuel mileage.
Yokohama makes a competing tire, the A008.

If you don't care about tire mileage, buy the Comp TA R1 (track version) in
the same 225VR50/15 size. I use these on my car for driver's ed events here
in the Northeast. They are mounted on a separate set of wheels specifically
for track events. They fit under the wheel wells at both ends just fine. You
can't outdrive them ona normally-aspirated (non-turbo) car. DO NOT try to
drive them in the rain, they are nearly slick-treaded. Expect about 6k miles
on a set driven spiritedly on the street. Yoko makes a competitor A008 track
tire, too.

Good luck with your choices.
