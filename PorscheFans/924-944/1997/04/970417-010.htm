Gee Farzaan, 

Guest you answered yourself in that one. In one hand you have technique,
use of hp and balance, in the other just oure HP for a speed burst. One
is racing the other is show off... Some old racing cars especially post
II world war use a lot of superchargers but with a lot of technological
improvements they put that baby to sleep and staretd compressing!!. If
you ever rememember the 80's the team Hart in F1 took close to 800+ hp
from a 2.5 l 4 cyl.( might be a 3l ). And the poor thing was reliable. 

On the Paris Dakar in 85, DAF, a truck company had close to 1200 HP on a
truck, and that beast almost won the race in front of a 500hp Peugeot
205 16V turbo and a 911/59 clone rally trim. he was 3rd. 

So if you're looking for technology, or take a lot of power from small
displacement engine, turbocharge it. If you have a lot of iron,
supercharge it.
