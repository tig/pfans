Hello gang:

I've a noticed a little glitch with the temp reading on my 'baby'. Before
doing the complete belts and updated water pump service my temp gauge rode
just below the first hash mark on the highway, and on the 1st line in town,
despite any playful romps. After service, needle starts at just over 1st hash
 mark on highway, and in town is  almost to the 2nd mark most of the time. It
basically appears to be very touchy. 
  The subject, by the way is a '87 944, and my local Porsche dealer did the
servicing. Which leads me to my aggrevation. It seems that Porsche (and many
other car marques for that matter) feel the need for a buffer between the
mechanics and what I feel is a well informed motoring public. ( I realize
there are obvious exceptions) This buffer has a title.....Service Advisor.
This is the second Porsche dealer I have been to and both times the 'Service
Advisor' is not even up on what should be his area of expertise. "Let me ask
my Technician" is all I heard on two seperate occasions to two different
dealers. On the last trip in after insisting  three times that the updated
NEW water pump be installed, I arrived to pick up car only to look at invoice
to see the dreaded letter x at the end of the part number. I called his
attention to this and he still didn't understand the inherent difference
between NEW and REBUILT.

I appreciate any help with this matter, if someone has experienced anything
similar let me know what you did to remedy. BTW I re-bled  and both fans
check out as for as temp kick on ect. Thermostat is supposedly the same as
one that came out of car.

Beware of evil.... for his name is Service Advisor.
