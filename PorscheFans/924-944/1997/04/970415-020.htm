Matt,

I feel that your analysis of the two systems is a bit basic.  Rather than
going into each system and how they work, it would be best if those
interested to read up on it, there are some excellent books that describe
both systems.  Keep in mind that a turbocharger is just an exhaust driven
supercharger so when looking for books, they will usually be labelled
as supercharger books.

The key difference between a supercharger and a turbocharger is the way
they build and maintain boost.  Superchargers are linear 1psi at 2000rpm,
5psi at 4000rpm and 10psi at 6500rpm for example.  Turbos on the other
hand build boost exponentially (which is why we use a wastegate to control
it), so you could have wastegate controlled boost of, say 0psi at 2000rpm,
10psi at 4000rpm and 10psi at 6500rpm.  You lose some bottom end, but
gain the midrange power.  To increase the boost on a supercharger, a 
different vane has to be used or the pulley size has to be changed.  On
a turbo, all that is required is a bleeder valve in the line going to the
wastegate.

The most common problem with superchargers is sizing the unit for the
engine.  Most superchargers don't provide enough top end if the bottom
end feels good.  With the new technology in turbochargers (roller bearing),
you can have your cake and eat it too.  The new roller bearing turbos
are quite amazing.  I had the opportunity to play with one.  The friction
in the standard turbo was such that handspinning the turbine wheel resulted
in about 10 rotations before the friction stopped the wheel.  On the
roller bearing turbo, spinning the wheel resulted in the turbine spinning
for at least 50 rotations.  You could blow on the turbine and it spun
easily on the roller bearing turbo!  This reduces lag significantly and
allows higher shaft RPM to give more boost at the top end.  At the time
I tested the roller bearing turbo, the cost was US$6000, but I've
already seen records smashed in import racing using the new T04 Garrett
based roller bearing turbo and with anything produced in large numbers,
the fixed costs get spread over the larger inventory and costs go down.

Anyhow, my intention is not to start a "my car is better than yours" 
debate, but there have been major advances in turbocharging and 
intercooling to make the system work more efficiently and produce more
power than superchargers.

What is really amazing is how an 80's technology turbocharging system like
the 944 Turbo has can still be competitive in this day and age and in
some cases, is still innovative (water pump for turbo cooldown).  Porsche,
there really is no substitute.
