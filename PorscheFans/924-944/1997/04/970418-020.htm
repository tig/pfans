Dave,

How do these pro shops dynamically balance the impeller-shaft-compressor
assembly once they are installed on the bearing housing?  I guess the real 
question is, what do they do if the balance is not adequate?  Do they 
disassemble the whole thing again?  At the first rebuild of my turbo, the
compressor blades (exhaust side) were covered with light grey build-up that
looked very much like the silica crud that you see on spark plugs after too
many miles with a bad air filter.  It was evenly coated over the entire
surface and may not have affected the balance that much.  Nonetheless, I had
the compressor blades bead blasted to get this stuff off.  The turbo spun up 
much faster and quieter than before.  I just put the impeller wheel on the
shaft at the same position I found it.  I used it for 8 years (2 smokeless
and 6 with start-up smoke) and at my rebuild last year found the bearings to 
have no apparent wear on them.  The exhaust side bearing was a bit coked 
up though, and it looked like the oil holes in the bearing were about to be 
choked off.  After a thorough cleaning with solvents, they fit on the shaft
just like the new ones.

The moral of my story is, I think an individual can rebuild a turbo without
worrying about dynamic balance if they can just put the spinning parts back 
together the way they found them.  I just wish I could figure out why these
things insist on leaking oil into the compressor side, apparently after they 
are shut down.  I get no smoke at all a minute or two after start-up.  I guess
the oil could be getting into the exhaust housing, but I definitely see a
connection between the amount of oil in the compressed intake ducting and smoke
at start-up.  New valve seals don't help a bit and I don't see any oil being 
blown from the exhaust pipe.

Any turbo-heads out there care to comment?
