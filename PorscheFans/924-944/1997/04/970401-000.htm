Jim, 
   Well, this is about what it took.  I used the handle from my floor
jack as an extension to my breaker bar.  I estimate that it took between
600 and 800 ft-lbs to break loose, with a loud noise. The breaker bar
and 1/2 inch drive extension were flexing so much, I was a bit worried
one of them would break!  After removing the bolt, other than the head,
it looked brand new.   I guess you just have to attack the damn thing
with no fear.  

  Anyone have any advice as to the best method of keyway removal? I am
replacing the seals on the balance shaft, camshaft, and crankshaft, they
are in the way.

 Should I:
1) Grab onto them with vice grips and hope I don't round them off to the
point of no removal

2) grind a slot with the dremel tool so I can pry it off with a
screwdriver?

3) None of the above?


Thanks again!

We had the same problem with mine.  The solution was to heat the bolt to
a
dull red glow, apply a 6 point 3/4 drive socket and breaker bar.  Add a
4
foot section of pipe to the breaker and give it a big pull.  I would of
never twisted as far as my engine builder did.  He cranked about 180
degrees before it broke loose with a bang.  Do not be afraid to heat the
stubborn bolts.  It is cheaper to replace a few bolts than to have to
have
the bolt holes Heli-coiled.

On your stripped radiator drain, either try Locktite thread restorer or
drill and tap to the next larger size.
