Jerry:

I drove with SS lines on another (non-Porsche) vehicle for two years and
never had any problems -- approximately 15k per year plus occasional
autocross and track events. The lines made a significant difference in
pedal feel; I seemed to notice it the most when the brakes were very hot
near the end of a track session.

SS lines used to be a "no-no" according to DOT standards, but now some
manufacturers make lines which are DOT approved. Shop accordingly and buy
from a reputable source, and you shouldn't have any problems. One caveat,
though: Make sure the lines don't rub against anything else.

-Jeff
