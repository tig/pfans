In a message dated 97-04-18 16:16:53 EDT, you write:

<<I have always gotten the non-digest
 mode so that I could easily respond directly, and add the specific
 list if I think that my answer might have general value and is correct,
 not just speculation as so many answers are.
 
 There is no list boss, so you can answer any way you like.   There
 are those who will complain if you don't chop out most of the 
 original messages, but the majority of the list is pretty tolerant.
 My pet peeves relate to using the list for public gossip and/or
 non-Porsche garage sale crap.   However, if I go away for a few
 days and come back to maybe 800 messages, I can clear them
 out in less than an hour.
 
 To thine own self be true . . . do unto others . . . etc.
 
 Welcome aboard.  >>

You know, I started in this list  in Digest mode, and it hadnt worked.  In
that mode it is FAR too difficult to read and respond.

But about a day or so ago I signed again in non-digest mode.  And just as you
said...it is far more enjoyable and more communicative...in non-digest mode.
 After all thats what e-mail is about.  800 responses in about an hour.

NON-DIGEST FOR ME.
