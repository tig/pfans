I've only seen one car that doesn't do this.  FWIW, Porsches were doing it
(at least) since '79.  I'd always thought that it was to avoid "lag" in
case your foot slipped off the throttle, you were shifting gears, etc.

For example, shifting at 3.5K I can take my foot totally off the
accelerator and the car comes in at pretty damn close to the right speed
(2.2K, 2.5K).  Seems that the idle drops more slowly at lower engine
speeds.

I've got the K-Jetronic manual.  I know 944s use Motronic, but I'll check
to see if it's a particular device that does this, or just the shape of
the air-flow sensor housing (which is what I suspect right now).

FYI, it's shaped sorta like this:

       \                      /		- gradual
	\		     /
	  \     ------     /		- sharp
	    \		 /
	     \          /		- gradual

Sorry for the crappy ASCII graphics.
