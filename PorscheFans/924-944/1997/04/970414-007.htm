As far as I know, you are doing your best already.

They will stop when you replace the dash, other than that, no.

The exact number is 100%.

> And of those, what percentage do something about it?

There are covers made of plastic that can be slipped over the dash to hide
the cracks.  They cost about $75.00.  A new dash costs about $750.00 for
your car.  The $75.00 option is not bad, but you get what you pay for.

Dashes can be repaired with some miracle plastic gel, but the root of the
problem is the plastic is releasing some of its chemical makeup when
exposed to U.V. light.  After the repair is made the plastic will continue
to crack at the original points and new ones will begin to show.  Also, the
underlying foam on the dash will deteriorate as time goes by aggravating
the problem.

The best solution is to buy a new dash.  If you can do it yourself, it is
just another expense these cars need every 8 - 10 years (if you take care
of it).
