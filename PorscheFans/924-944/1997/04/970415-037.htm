Hi,

When the engine is cold ('82 924) it starts right up, then dies in a few
seconds. Each time I attempt to restart it it runs for a few seconds longer
before quiting. I can rev it to 2-3,000 rpm, or above, each time, and hold
it at that speed until it dies.  After 4 or 5 attempts it will then run
okay. After this first start of the day, it then starts easily every time. 

Has any one on the list had this problem? Or any ideas where to start
looking. That it starts easily suggests that the cold start injectors are
working. That I can hold the rpm at 2,000 rpm plus and it still dies
suggests  the auxilary air value is not the problem.

It seems the engine has to obtain a certain temperture before it will keep
running. But, how much is the engine warmed with just running 15-30 seconds
for 4 or 5 times? Help!

MIchael
