Jerry,

I have always thought that the camber at the exit helps determine
whether to take as a single or double apex.  When the exit is
"on-camber", the corner can sometimes be taken as a single-apex; when it
is "off-camber" (or slippery, or wet), I usually take it as a
double-apex.n  The reaoning is that with a double-apex, the cornering
load is not as high at the track-out point, giving better grip to start
accelerating.  As usual, though, let your own rump be your guide!

Regards,
