The engine is assembled!  I inspect it from all angles to make sure it is
not a cardboard cutout.  All parts appear to be real and the master (my
engine builder) has it sitting in the entrance to his shop for all to
admire.  The time has finally arrived, nothing can stop final installation
now.

We push my engineless machine into the master's lair and onto the lift. 
Ha!  The lift is mine.  The master asks "you remember which bolts to pull
to drop the under carriage, don't you?".  I will hear "you remember......."
countless times during our next week together.  I remember nothing, it was
eight months ago when I pulled this thing out.  Mr. photo brain however
remembers most all the details even if he didn't disassemble it. 

I pull the A arms off to free the motor mounts and start cleaning off the
grease on the cross member.  As it is now night, I suspect no EPA  agent is
hiding in the bushes ready to pounce on me if I drop a speck of grease. 
The new motor mounts are different from the old ones!  I should of paid
more attention to the list.  In digging through the manuals, I find that
four 38mm bolts are required rather than the existing 50mm ones.  The
master's bolt bin gives up no 38mm bolts.   This is the first of several
minor set backs.

The master returns with a bag of AN aircraft hose fittings and stainless
braided hose for the oil system plumbing.  Another $400 for a bag of -12
fittings and hose.  Sticker shock no longer affects me, I am in an assembly
mode.  We set the engine down on a roller (yes, two fools can lift a turbo
engine). The master starts bolting on the Kevlar clutch and gonzo pressure
plate and I start to see stars.  We have worked through lunch and dinner
and I need food.  I depart as the master continues his work.  No one knows
if he eats or sleeps.

I spend the better part of the morning searching for 38mm bolts and settle
for 40mm.  As I enter the master's shop with my 40mm prize in hand, I see
the engine is in the car.  What a weasel!  I brought in my video camera to
capture the moment and it is already done.  He claims we will never get
this job completed at the rate we are going.  I grudgingly agree and start
to work.  Lining up the motor mounts and torque tube turns out to be a task
even with the master's help.  Each added part shrinks the working space. 
One part out of order requires its removal to install another part.

I am caught in a time warp.  I seem to be moving at normal speed yet every
time I look up the clock has advanced by two to three hours.  The new
theory of relativity must be E=944 squared.  For every installation
procedure, the hours in the flat rate book are squared when I attempt the
task.  I spend a day installing the remote oil filter and air/oil separator
in the front fender well.  Day turns to night and we toil on.  The master
bails me out when I get stuck.  I vow there is room in my tool box for a
collection of 1/4" universals, wobbles, deep sockets and long extensions. 
It is proven to me beyond a reasonable doubt that my 3/8" tools just will
not fit where the 1/4" will.  (Tech Tip:  The majority of the nuts and
bolts on this beast are either 10mm of 13mm socket)  The burger and fries
my wife dropped off at lunch go in the microwave at 7:30 p.m. when the
stars reappear before my eyes.  On my drive home at midnight, I scan the
streets looking for a person with small hands with suction cups on the ends
of their fingers.  Surely evolution has produced a strain of Porsche
mechanics no one has discovered.  

The next day the engine cavity is packed tighter and tighter with parts. 
As we attempt the final plumbing of the accumulator, oil filter, air/oil
separator, electric switch and back flow valve, we find there is no room at
the inn.  Each proposed placement is met with interference of another part.
 The tire, the oil cooler, the power steering, the fan, the windshield
washer tank, you name it, it is in the way.  The remote oil filter castings
were designed for -8 fittings and two -12 fittings side by side will not
fit.  The master stalks off to his lathe to turn the fittings down.  It is
an oil line the size of your thumb or no oil line at all, no compromise
here. The R&D projects are about completed as the master detects the new
crank triggers are scraping the starter housing.  Remove starter, grind
starter, reinstall starter, the starter and the master are now old friends.

I fight through the maze of wires and hoses to insert the crank sensors. 
There is a potential nut eating hole in the bell housing right next to
where the sensors are.  I envision dropping both the sensor hold down nuts
in that hole and having to pull the engine to get them out.  The master
deftly installs the nuts and mumbles something about child's play.  He
would of done more than mutter if I had dropped one of those nuts in that
hole.  That night I dream of vacuum lines, air and water hoses and other
joyous car delights.
