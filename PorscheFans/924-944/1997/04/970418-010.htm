The fuel pump relay does sound like Greg's problem, but I don't think the 931 
relay is the same as the early 944.  I just had mine go out last year and was 
astounded by the prices I was quoted.  The 924-44 (a.k.a. Audi) relay was about 
$30-40, while the 931 relay (PN 931 xxx xxx) was about $70 as I recall.  There's 
nothing special about it, but there were only a few thousand 931s made and maybe 
a few hundred still kicking around.  The 931 relay has an extra circuit for the
boost limit cut-out switch.
