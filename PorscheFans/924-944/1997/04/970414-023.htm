As I understand it, most 944 Alloy A-Arm re-builders (in the US at least) 
dissassemble new ball joints from early '85 A-Arms to obtain the needed parts. 
Would I recommend using the procedure I listed? Only if you check it very 
often.  If you dissassemble one of these ball joints, the cage is a very hard 
plastic material.  It is an interference fit, but not to the point where you 
would do any damage to the alloy A-Arm in removal and installation. As I said, 
I am still searching for more suitable ball joint parts to rebuild with. I 
know the Aluminum tape thing will not last very long, but would work for a 
while.(I was able to reproduce approximately the same interference fit as a 
new ball joint using the tape methode.)

  If I can't find a larger Ball joint for parts that fits correctly, I will 
try to come up with something better than the Aluminum tape thing. Obviously, 
a suitably shaped piece of sheet metal of the correct thickness would work 
well, but would be a bit tricky to make.  Until then, I will be using the used 
A-Arm from the salvage yard, not the one I am experimenting on..

Just trying to get all of you to think about this.  I consider $150 -> $300 
for a "professional" rebuild to be a rip off, and would like a less expensive, 
safe and reliable alternative if I ever need to replace these again.

Thanks,
