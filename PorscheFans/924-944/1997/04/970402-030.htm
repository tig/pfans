        Here is a question for those of you who have seen a lot of 944s.  My
'90 S2 has unusual power seats - they have more a lot more lateral support
(bolster) than any other 944 seats I have seen - but mine is the only S2 I
have ever had a good look at.  The previous owner of the car told me they
were Recaros, installed as a factory "sport seat" option.  Personally, I
think they are great, and the electric heat feature is nice too.   What can
you tell me about these seats?  I have not seen a 944 with them before - how
unusual are they?  What did this option cost in a new car?
