Hi, Michael,

In the June, 1991 issue of Porsche Panorama, John Paterek wrote:

"...This is probably caused by letting the hatch fly up against the stop 
rather than restraining it by hand.  Epoxy sealant bonds the glass to the 
aluminum frame and after years of use, the hinges bind due to lack of 
being lubricated.  The frame breaks off, lifts the glass, causes the leak 
and soon becomes inoperable.  It can be repaired by unbolting the glass 
deck lid, sitting it on a pair of work horses and cleaning out the old 
epoxy.  When the surface of the glass is clean and dry, mask the glass 
and frame and fill the gap with black two-part epoxy (Devcon).  Clamping 
may be required if the frame is bent.  Before it is dry, pull the tape 
off and let dry for 24 hours before reinstalling the glass lid.  The 
repair will hold and save many dollars in replacement deck costs."

I hope this helps you and the other people that have asked about this 
problem recently.
