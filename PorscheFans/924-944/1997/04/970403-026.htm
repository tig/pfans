Open up the glove box.  In there you will see a little plastic tube.  That is the blinker fluid access point.  I filled mine up with synthetic fluid, the blinkers work now much better in cold temperatures.

Doug, though air-cooled, the 1971(?) 911s did use blinker fluid, the access point was on the rear right fender, looks like a gas filler door.

1987 944S




PS. Actually, I checked the header to see if this message if it was sent out on the 1st of
April it was not.  Maybe the mechanic mentioned the blinker fluid on the 1st of April :-)

PPS. PLEASE, PLEASE do not follow the above directions, we all know what the plastic tube is, right?  Also it might have been the 1972 911 that had the external oil filler access point, I am not sure about the year.
