Could be a manifold leak, which goes away as the metals swell with heat.  
When you first start the engine, run your hand along the joints to feel 
for exhaust spurting out before the engine heats up.  Gasket replacement 
recomended.

Listmembers?

Sounds normal.  The first mark is where the thermostat just starts to 
open.  The fans should come on at low speed when the gauge indicates 
about halfway, and in high speed (or second fan on older cars) when the 
pointer hits the 2/3 mark.  I would be concerned if the pointer is over 
the 2/3rd mark for an extended period.

Factory pads, but I am sure others will chime in with opinions..  ;-)

Members?

Probably neither.  Cars with wide tires tend to wander in grooves like 
this.  I have 225 front and 245 rear, and the steering wheel tends to pull 
around a bit, even with good suspension and alignment.  By habit, I 
travel just a bit to one side in the lane to avoid this.
