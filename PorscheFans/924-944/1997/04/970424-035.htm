Hi Sam,

It sounds like you have already talked yourself into that new car, but I
would bet that you would be better off to keep the Turbo on the track, at
least until you get more experience.  If you are just getting started with
driving on the track, it is easy to get preoccupied with decisions like
these when the truth is, either car will be a good vehicle from which to
learn.  Even a Yugo would be good enough to learn basic driving techniques
on the track that can be applied to a serious racing machine.

You, yourself, said that a normally aspirated car out performed the rest of
the guys on the track (owing to that driver's experience) which should tell
you that a quality guitar is not an essential ingredient for a master to
make sweet music.

In the mean time you can use that time to better see what other people are
really getting the most out of in the way of a track car.  The S2 may, or
may not be the best assault weapon for you, but it is too early to worry
about it.

Get some more track experience and have fun.  I'll bet after you are better
seasoned at racing this question will be easy to answer, and if it turns
out that the Turbo is the right car, you won't have to sell two cars and
buy two cars to get it back.

Just my thoughts, good luck with what ever you choose.

Marv
