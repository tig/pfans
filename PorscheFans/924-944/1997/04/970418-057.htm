Paul,

        Everyone keeps asking me if my car has been lowered.  I tell them
yes because my mechanics have determined that this was indeed the case.  But
I didn't bother to ask them exactly how this was accomplished in my car.
How can I tell if my springs are aftermarket?  I know the PO installed the
yellow adjustable Koni shocks in there.  Where and how can I check the
bumper height adjustments or indexing points on my torsion bars?
        Also, I noticed that while my '83 NA 944's tail was always a little
higher than the nose, my '86 951's tail seems droopy.  Is the rear lower
than the front because of worn torsion bars?  No one else can tell, but I
swear the rear of my car sits a lower than the front.
        Thanks for helping...

directly through its center...
