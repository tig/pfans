P-fans:

I printed out a recent digest (4/17, I think) and it ran 70 pages!  We all
love the content, but there is a lot of excess bandwidth here.  A few
suggestions, and yes, I realize that you already know all this, but a
reminder wouldn't hurt:

1.  Please requote only enough of a previous post to give context to your
comment.  There is rarely any need to requote more than a line or two.

2.  The sign-off comments which accompany your name and e-mail address can
run a little long.  They are usually quite amusing the first time we read
them, but not after that.  An example (sorry to pick on one person, any one
of a number of examples would do) is the story about the smallest ball
bearing and the way the Germans one-upped the Americans by drilling a hole in
it.  I enjoyed the story initially, but I have now seen it many times and it
is just excess bandwidth to me now.

I think that we will all enjoy the list more if it is more compact.  Thanks!
