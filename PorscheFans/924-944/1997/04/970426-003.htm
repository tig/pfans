After listening to this thread for a while I have to add my $.02.

Why do we compare the track performance of different vehicles to decide which is 'better'? If I take that to the logical extreme I think that the answer is a formula 1 car is better. If you wish to compare driver skills, which to me is what track events are all about, then you need to compare similar cars. I have run many different types of cars at track events from time trailing Hondas to racing my GT-350. My conclusion (take it or leave it) is that learning in a lower powered car will make you more aware of what good technique is. 
Reasoning: If you have tons of power you can recover lost speed quicker and a 'bad' corner will not impact the lap times as much. If you make a mistake in a low powered car you will pay for it for quite a while!! Horsepower is really great for masking mistakes, even from yourself.
Anyway - My advice is to run what you have and compare it against similar cars. If someone with an extra 100 hp or so is happy about beating you by a couple of tenths then they just don't understand.
Work on your skill first and the car (either improvement or selecting a different model) second. I've seen some 'pigs'* go mighty fast when driven by the right driver. (Even saw a Fiat 128 embarrass some V-8's at Bridgehampton!)
Interesting note - after getting a ride in George B's green 944 turbo the other day I think he could stop at every other corner and ask for directions and still run the same lap times as my NA!! Very quick but I think it would be much harder to learn in than an NA.

Chris White - just remember - you get beaten by a driver not a car, with out the driver they pretty much just stand there unless the parking brake is not engaged..
