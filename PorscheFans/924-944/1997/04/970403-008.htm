I've just picked up my '86 951 from the shop and finally have a warm sunny
day in Toronto to drive it around a bit.  However, I've noticed that the car
vibrates pretty badly at idle then smoothes out above 1000 RPM so the one or
more of the motor mounts are probably gone.  My question is: how many motor
mounts are there and how many hours of labour should I expect to pay for
realistically to have them replaced??  Also, how vital is it to replace them
right away??  I've spent just over $10,000 on the car since getting it in
November (including wheels and tires) and would like to give my bank account
a vacation!!  However, if it is important to have them replaced ASAP, then
I'll have to bite the proverbial bullet and do it. Any information would be
greatly appreciated....
