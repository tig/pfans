Your on dash voltmeter should register more than 12 volts when charging.
More in the neighborhood of 14volts, even if you have a poor connection
to your batt terminals. The regulator, or alternator connections, sound
suspect, but not having any experience with the charging system on the
944, maybe someone else on the list can help you? 

  While we are on the subject of alternators, why is there a separate
vent hose connected to the rear of the alternator, the other end sticks
into the wheel well where the engine air intake resides. Is this an
attempt to use the heat generated by the alternator to pre-heat the
intake air slightly?  Seems if that were the case, they would have
coupled the two ducts together more than just having the openings next
to each other in the wheel well..
