     I'm having a problem with the heating/cooling fan switch in my car  
     (this is the fan switch on the dashboard).  It doesn't work until the 
     switch is set to the highest speed  - all other speed settings get no 
     response.  I described this to a Porsche mechanic and he said it was 
     likely the resistor pack, which only affects operation at lower speeds 
     - at the highest speed current flows directly to the fan.
     
     My questions - 
     
     o other than a dealer ($$), does anyone know where I can buy a 
     resistor pack?  And would you see any problem with a used one?
     
     o I'd like to install this myself but did not see anything in the 
     Haynes manual that covers this.  I'm new to Porsches but can generally 
     figure things out with a manual.  Any ideas about where I can find 
     some instructions?
     
     Thanks for any help
