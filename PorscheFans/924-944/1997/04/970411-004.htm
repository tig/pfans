The switch closest to the driver is for the driver's side.

The regulator assembly (the scissors mechanism which raises and lowers the
window) frequently is loose on these cars. Pull the interior cover off the
door and tighten the bolts. If you only want to do it once use some blue
Loctite on the bolts. Everything is easily accessible inside there.

There is a small plastic linkage between the lock motor and the lock
mechanism. It gets brittle with age and breaks. Easy and cheap to replace.
