Jerry, I have another point to add:

What I understand (partly from what I read on this list) is that when the braiding 
on a SS line gets cut during normal use and abuse, it will start cutting into the 
hose and destroy the hose(the edges of the braiding are sharp) , thus no brakes.

On a race car that gets checked out thoroughly before and after an event that is 
acceptable.  On a daily driven car this represents extra risk because I know of 
nobody who lifts up their car to check the lines before and after driving their car 
to the grocery store or to work.
