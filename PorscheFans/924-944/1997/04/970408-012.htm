I got tired of that pump (which takes about 45 minutes to inflate the
deflated little spare) and replaced it with a regular, inflated spare
mounted on that inflatable's wheel. It fit in the wheel well of an 89
944, but I had to have a new carpet piece made. That cost me about $125,
but was well worth it not to have to anticipate another 45 minutes
inflating a flimsy spare on a stormy Colorado mountain road. If anyone
wants details, email me.
