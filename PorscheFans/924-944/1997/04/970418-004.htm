This puzzles me too.. On my 924, there seems to be only two jacking points -
one in the center of each rocker panel. It seems possible to jack up one
side of the car and place jack stands under it, but the position of the
jacking points would mean that jacking one side up with the other side on
jack stands would lift the entire car! That doesn't sound right to me. I
could jack at the positions suggested in the Haynes manual for placing the
jack stands, but then I wouldn't be able to place the jack stands there..

Another thing, is it possible to jack only the rear or front of the car up
and place it on jack stands? Is this safe?
