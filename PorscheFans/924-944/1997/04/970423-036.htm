All -

If you can avoid it, I would suggest not going to the conversion from an 
expense standpoint.  As mentioned it is quite expensive and the FR-12 
from Penzoil is a drop-in replacement for R-12.  Price for "regular" R-12 
right now is over $700 (wholesale cost) for 30#.  That's about $23/# cost 
to the mechanic.  I have heard that FR-12 is available for about 20% of 
that and your existing system is compatible as is.  R-134a isn't cheap 
either.

If you are loosing freon every year, you have a leak and best bet is to
find it.  It could be a number of things from the expansion device,
compressor, evaporator/condensor coil, fittings or the lines.  Rubber
lines are terrible as are the fittings around them.  Those that have leaks
should find a shop that has a leak tester that uses a dye and a black
light to find the leak.  They fill the system with some freon, inject the
dye and then search for the leak with the black light.  A number of
heating and air conditioning firms have had to go to this for leak finding
because the old methods aren't sensitive enough to find the two - three
ounces per month.  That's just enough so that our 30-36 ounces systems
loose their charge in about a year.  If your mechanics shop doesn't have
this test, maybe you can talk your local refrigeration/a-c shop into leak
checking your system for you.  One of these leak detectors runs about 
$600-700.
