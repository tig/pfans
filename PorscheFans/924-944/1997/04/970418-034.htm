I think you might be confusing LSD (Limited Slip Differential, aka
"Positraction", which is a mechanical mechanism) with Traction Control,
which is primarily electronic.

Limited slip differentials have been used for a very long time because they
allow power to be transmitted to the wheel with the most traction. For
obvious reasons, this is a boon for sports and racing cars.

Traction control (such as implemented on late-model BMWs and other cars)
employs various mechanisms to reduce wheelspin -- usually, power is reduced
or ABS brakes applied to control wheelspin and therefore maintain traction
for the driving wheels. The system is primarily intended to improve
stability on wet and icy roads.
