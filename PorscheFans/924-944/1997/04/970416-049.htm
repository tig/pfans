I was driving home from work today and all of a sudden, my 924T died.  While doing 
about 70mph, I lost all power, my tachometer immediately went to zero, and my oil and 
battery lights came on.  I down shifted and attempted to pop the clutch, but to no 
avail.  Once I was safely stopped on the shoulder I tried to start it again.  The engine 
would turn over, but clearly would not start.  After inspecting all of my belts, (which 
are fine, including the timing belt) I am thinking this is either an electrical problem 
or something with the fuel injectors.  Any other ideas to what the problem might be 
before I tear into the engine on Saturday would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg Sipes
