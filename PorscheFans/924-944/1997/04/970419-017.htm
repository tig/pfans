Had a friend once whose parents owned a Yugo.  His mother won it in the
lottery or at a raffle or something.  It was a Yugo or $200.  (She made
the wrong decision.)

Anyway, I saw them driving it around once.  Hit a stick about half an inch
in diameter and got something like a half-foot of air.  It was ridiculous.
But even that lightweight, it took about five miles to get up to 55.

Believe it or not, the car (sports suspension or no) managed to last
about two or three years before it died (irrepairably).  Not bad,
considering I doubt you could buy a car that'd last that long with $200.
