Hi Porschefans:

I just took my Pirelli Winter 210 snows off my 968 and put the Dunlop D40M2s
back on.  I bought the car in December and only drove it a few miles at that
time before taking the Dunlops off and putting the snows on.  I couldn't
remember whether the Dunlops were noisy or not, but after putting them back
on today I realize that they are moderately loud on the highway, about the
same or a little quieter than the snows.  It isn't a big deal, but I drive
the car every day about 20 miles each way to work on the highway, so
quietness is a virtue.  My wheel and tire sizes are standard.

I will certainly wait until the D40s wear out before replacing them, but when
I do, is there a tire with decent performance and less noise?  Ultimate
performance is not my objective.  They would have to be Z rated, however.
 Any suggestions?

Thanks!
