In the Western Washington area or in the B.C. area, if you see an 87 Turbo
going for a decent price, can you shoot me an email at fkassam@direct.ca

I'm trying not to send too many ripples through our local racing community
by asking this, but Paul and I are thinking of buying a car together and
building an all-out race car.  Our street cars are just too nice (really
low mileage on both of ours) and we've always wanted a really lightweight
car with a powerful motor.  We're thinking of lightening it as much as
we can in our class (Canadian A/SP) and then running a "S" turbo upgrade
with a boost chip.  We're hoping to get the weight down to 2500lbs with
driver and have about 280hp.  Should make a rocket for under $20,000
in preparation.  Running costs should be no more than $5000 a year.

If this year goes well, I think we will be able to get a few thou of
sponsorship too.  Anyone with a real race car want to comment about our
idea?  Are we dreaming, or are we heading in the right direction?

The main goal is to do a lot of track days with this car.  Currently,
we've been focussing on auto-x, but track days and maybe some PCA
Club Racing are in the future focus.

Farzaan.
