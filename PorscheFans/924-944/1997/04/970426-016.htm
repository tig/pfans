Here is my 2 cents and assumptions,

I recently removed the auto-authority chips from my car ('89 944 turbo, with
2.8L andial engine, w/ k-27 turbo).  As a result of removing the chips my
drivability around town has increased.  The throttle isn't as touchy any more
and it is easier to maintain a constant speed through town.  Also off the
throttle lag isn't as noticeable.  Previously if you let off the throttle (with
the chips) the car wouldn't respond right away, then it would cut off sharply,
causing the drive wheels to lug the engine.

Full boost has dropped from 1.0 bar to .8 bar.  Boost also comes on a little
later (this is only the second day with out chips, so I'm starting to notice
these things)

My car doesn't backfire anymore.  With the chips my car would backfire whenever
I let off the throttle to shift.  The backfire was a result of fuel spilling
into the exhaust manifold.  When I put the stock chips in the car quit
backfiring.

The stock chips are a compromise between performance and drivability.  They try
to maintain the optimal ratio between fuel and oxygen to get a full burn  This
results in a cooler engine, and better emissions.  At WOT the stock chips will
enrich the mixture, however for normal driving it will try to maintain the
optimum ratio of fuel and oxygen.

The auto-authority chips enriches the mixture, advances the timing and allows
for higher boost levels (for the whole rpm range).  Enriched fuel mixtures will
cause more polutants, and may cause catylitic converter problems.

Since our cars are already designed to run on high octane gas, it is debateable
whether or not the aftermarket chips will be able to effectively use the same
octane with out pinging.  Porsche probably retards the timing somewhat for
lower grade fuel, however since our cars have knock sensors Porsche may have
advanced timing to use high grade fuel, and depended on the knock sensors to
retard timing when low grade fuel was used. (hope that statement made some
sense).

Chips are a (relatively) cheap way to increase power (my personal opinion is
that they are still too expensive).  My hope is that the manufactures spent
lots of time to dyno and develop their chips so that are not too many bad side
affects.

I really don't have a problem with the auto-authority chips except for the
backfiring part.  Drivability problems don't bother me that much.  However I
probably don't have the optimum chips for my application.  I called Andial and
they do sell chips for the 2.8L cars.  The guy criticized auto-authority and
said they advanced the timing too far.  (of course this is someone merely
saying their word about the competition)

Have fun!
