You didn't give any details on he 924 you are looking at.. like mileage,
body condition, is it running, etc.  I am just finishing a restoration on a
79 924. Generally the 924's seem to be easier to maintain than 944's.. The
timing belt can be changed without buying a $400.00 tool to tension it.  I
don't have my car on the road yet so I can't help you with mileage etc.  I
believe the 78's have 115 hp.
Parts are expensive and so is service.  If you can follow instructions in a
shop manual these cars aren't  rocket science.  Please respond if you have
more specific questions.
