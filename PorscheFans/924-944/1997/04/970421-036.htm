I have been struggling with this dilemma ever since I bought my 944
Turbo.  That is: which is better (for me) a Turbo or an S2.  I know
no-one can answer that for me.  It seems that I have this disease, the
symptoms of which are: 48 hours after attending some driving event, I get
it in my head that I am not driving the best car for me, and that I have
to get that one.  Is there a name for this "greener grass" fixation.
 After my first autocross, I thought: my car handles badly, and the turbo
has no low end power.  What I need is a 911!  I continued in this frame
of mind until my first track event (Lime Rock Conn.17-18).  There I saw
that the 944s really shined.  I enjoyed driving my car immensely.  There
was especially this one 944: black, Mass. plates, very stock looking.
 This thing was like a rocket ship.  It roared down the straight, and was
passing cars left and right.  I was dumbfounded.  I went up to the guy
after and asked him what mods he did to the car.  I expected to hear a
laundry list of turbo mods, software, etc...turns out it was a normally
aspirated 944.  It had a nice exhaust, and had been rebuilt (I wander if
it was blue printed) recently.
48 hours later...it hit me.  I need one of those (normally aspirated), or
more specifically - an S2.  I've always loved the S2, and have before
almost turned my car in for one.  If I could have an S2 and have it
perform like this guy's, I'd be *happy*.

For anyone who would like to try to knock some sense in me, here's my
basic situation...

Drive car every day to work.
Like low end power, not top speed.
Love track events.  Want to eventually convert whatever car I have to a
track car, and yes, will probably continue to drive it to work.
Can't afford to have a shop do all the work.  I do whatever I can at home
(and I love to work on the car).  I like the idea of the S2 being a more
"simple" car to work on.
Have no $$$ to speak of.  Am looking for an S2 that is about equal value
to my 88 951.
The only thing I think I'd miss about the Turbo, is the option to modify
it, and get all this high end turbo boost.  The S2 is what it is...but
then I remember this 944 at the track.

For anyone who is still reading...Thanks for having compassion for my
serious condition...
