Tweeks is usually not a very cheap source, they are pretty similiar to
Automotion for many items.  Excellence magazine runs a lot of ads with mail
order places selling OEM oil filters for $3 to $4 dollars. Some places also
give discounts for quantity purchases. I picked up an oil filter from a
performance shop in town here( San Diego) for $6.00, & didn't have to pay
shipping charges.
However this was before I saw some of the cheaper ads. I'll try to look one
up and post it here tomorrow.
