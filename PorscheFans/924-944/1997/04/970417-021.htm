JACKING:

I bought a 2.5-ton hydraulic jack and (4) 3-ton jackstands... I'm a serious
shadetree fellow to be dealt with, right?

Well, no. I don't think I can get the car up on all four jackstands with
this arrangement. If I jack one side up, I think I'll push the car off when
I go to jack the other side... the jack has wheels, but I'm not sure the
force required to shift the wheels is less than the side force the jacking
places on the car... I'm on my concrete driveway, so it's quite a bit
rougher than a smooth garage floor... Haynes said to jack all four corners
up and then use the jackstands, but I'm not about to develop some kind of
cross member to get the whole car up from the center while a friend tries
to balance the car on the jack while I run around kicking jackstands under
the car... am I?

ROTORS:

I just installed new rear rotors/pads on my 1987 944... surprisingly
easy... I've been driving pretty slow, using the brakes pretty mildly...
when are they good to go?

I have to do the fronts this weekend, and the weekend after that, I will
flush the fluid and bleed the clutch and brakes... anything wrong this
arrangement?

any tips for doing the front, they do look more involved than the rears...

thanks...

next up: the resealing of the engine and oil cooler
