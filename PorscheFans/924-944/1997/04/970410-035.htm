What is the real story?

I too have heard all kinds of things about SS brake lines.  First why does
DOT not recognize them?  If they are used in racing (presumably under
higher stresses), why would DOT not approve them for street use?  Many, if
not most states, outright reject them (illegal in Pennsylvania).

I have heard stories that SS lines on race cars are examined after each
race as part of the tear down, and this should provide amble data as to the
road worthiness of the lines.  Perhaps long term dirt, tar, and oils do
them harm.  The SS braid does not make cleaning easy.  Most people do not
check the condition of their brake lines after each drive.  I am lucky to
inspect them with each oil change, and I suspect some people never check,
thinking that the service shop does that for them as a matter of course.

Another rumor I have heard is that a fresh set of OEM brake lines perform
the same (as far as pedal feel (sponginess)) as SS lines.  I have heard
that any difference in brake pedal feel could be attributed to the old
lines being worn.  This does make some sense.  Most people do not heave
brand new brake lines in favor of SS.  Therefore, it is not a qualitative
comparison.

For my own use as a daily driver, I have not found compelling reason to
abandon OEM parts.  I would be concerned at the possible repercussions that
could be legally levied against the owner of a car that installed
non-approved (not DOT approved) safety equipment, if it was found that
equipment was a contributing factor to an accident.

This is just some of the things I have heard, but does any one really know
what the deal is and why?
