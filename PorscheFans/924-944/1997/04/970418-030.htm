Not that you asked, but in my experience, LSD (mmm...) is of little use if
you're a good enough driver.  Same goes for ABS.  Actually, the same goes
for all those "safety devices" that the US government wants all cars to
have -- for the average driver, they're good, but for us, they ain't.

Closest thing to LSD I have in my Porsche is a negative roll radius on the
front wheels (which *is* useful, if you're good at it), and I've never
really worried about that.  Our other car has LSD.  Only time it ever
kicked in was when I was pushing the car hard (yeah, well, pushing a BMW
528e means getting it up to 30 in under five minutes) on a combination of
mud and gravel.  Actually, for a while I was worried that the car would
just sit there until hell froze over.  Eased off on the gas and the car
went out of there, nice and smooth.

The moral of the story is that for brainless drivers, LSD is a very good
thing.  (OK, so I'm brainless.)  But if you're a careful, observant
driver, who knows his car and his surroundings, you shouldn't really need
it.  YMWVAGD, of course.
