i talked to my friends at tire rack and they said NO WAY.  they said they dont 
fit the character of the car and they arent great handling tires. they suggest 
Dunlop SP-8000 or D40M2/in addition i currently have falkens on my car and i 
like them wuite a bit although on a softer compound i can smoke them until i 
have a nice cloud these are much too hard for that. they do last virtually 
forever though, i am on over 5K mil and the PO had them for about 15K and they 
arent expensive.
