A few months ago I reported bluish smoke coming from my car under hard
acceleration.

This weekend I replaced the water pump on my car.  I noticed that there was oil
inside the turbo to intercooler tube.  This oil is coming from my turbo, and
passing through my intake system into my engine.

Just when I think I'm done mechanically fixing my car... :(

Anyway, I've looked around the catalogs for k-27 turbo rebuild kits.  They all
cost about $200.  I can't seem to find many K-27 turbo rebuild kits (stock is
the k-26).  Does anyone have any particular knowledge on rebuilding turbos?  Is
it hard?

Also, how hard is it to remove and install the turbo?  I remember hearing
horror stories about trying to bolt the suckers on...

How long does it take to remove and install it?

Thanks!
