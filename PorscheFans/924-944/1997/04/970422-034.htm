Recently, the automatic door lock-unlock on the passenger side of my 91
S2 stopped working automatically.  That is to say, when I lock or unlock
the car with my key from the driver's side, the plunger on the passenger
side does not move.  The alarm is activated and I can hear the mechanism
clicking, so I don't think it is an electrical problem.  My current
work-around is to lock or unlock the car from the passenger side, since
the lock still works mechanically (as opposed to automatically) with the
key, and the driver's side continues to work automatically.  I've
thought about removing the door panel to take a look, but maybe someone
has some advice to offer about what I can do to repair this while I'm in
there.  Thanks.
