I believe ATS was the OEM for the cookie cutters.  The CC's had ATS and a =
=0APorsche part# on the inside.  The real "ATS" wheels looked similar but w=
ere =0Alighter and had a different design.  They also had "ATS" in raised l=
etters on =0Athe outside face of the wheel.  I have two sets of 7x15 ATS wh=
eels.  The =0Aseating faces for the lug nuts are conical rather than oval a=
nd the ATS lug =0Anuts were of course conical to match.   =0A =0ATed=0A=

I was the one who asked the original question. I received a reply (sorry
I didn't keep it on file) which stated that (I'm paraphrasing here) the
original wheels installed by Porsche on the '83 944 were branded ATS (on
the inside). I was just surprised because it seemed that everything else
had "Porsche" written on it and the wheels didn't... and they didn't
have a Porsche-style part number. I've assumed since then that the
wheels were original, just an aberration. Any more insight? //Pete Jones
