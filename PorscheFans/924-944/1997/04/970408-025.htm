Your humble FAQ-meister has received several requests for information in =
the FAQ on the diagnosis and repair of wayward headlamp motor systems.  =
I know this has been discussed in detail and in the past.  But I have =
never saved any of the discussions.

If anyone out there has a write-up on this, I'd much appreciate your =
passing along the material for addition to the FAQ.  Akk credit and =
praise will, of course, be given to deserving parties.

BTW, if you haven't seen the FAQ, please do check it out at =
http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html.  Comments are welcomed, =
along with corrections, requests for additions, and bottles of Kentucky =
Bourbon!

Cheers,

Kevin
