Hi All,

I have a few pictures of my 85.5 944 from the PO.  In these pictures there
isn't a front license plate bracket on the car - you can see 2 plugs where
the bolts go into the bumper.  I guess he took the plugs out and put a
front bracket on with a Porsche logo plate.  Since GA doesn't require front
plates and I think this Porsche logo plate really takes away from the car's
looks, I'd like to take the front bracket off but I'm going to need the
plugs.  I was at the dealer friday having a new windshield installed and
talked to the parts guy (who had a major attitude) and after 5 minutes of
almost arguing with him he pulled out the parts microfische.  I didn't see
the plugs listed in the diagram (but I did see the euro bumper listed).

Does anyone know anything about these plugs for the bumper?  Or, does
anyone have any of these they'd consider parting with if your state
requires front plates?

BTW, can you believe the dealer was the cheapest place in town to get a new
windshield.  I called about 6 places and the prices ranged from $590 to
$850.  When I called the insurance company, she wanted me to go to this
place they use all the time.  I asked her if I could take it to the dealer
and she said they'd be too expensive.  I told her I wanted to ensure the
place that does it knows Porsches.  So I called the dealer ($590) and then
called the place she wanted me to take it ($838) - she decided the dealer
would be the best place.  The plus side is I've retained a factory
windshield (Sekurit-made in Germany).
