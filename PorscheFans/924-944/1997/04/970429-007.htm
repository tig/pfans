Car: 1987 944 NA

I'm finally ready to tackle my leaky engine...

I'm replacing the cam cover and head gaskets, all seals above the
crankshaft including the oil cooler, all four major drive belts, the
radiator and the expansion tank (the hoses are pretty new, I'm hoping to
get away with giving them a decent cleaning), installing a new lower temp
t-stat and early/late on/off fan switch... it took about a month and a half
to get all the parts into my house and buy what I hope is all the tools
I'll need (including the $$$ belt tensioner, the balance shaft holding
wrench, a photocopied workshop manual to go with the Haynes, etc.)...

I feel that I've thought this out, but...

+ + +

I have never really done any major work like this before... I've been
competent in everything I've tried to do with my cars over the years, I've
just never opened the head up before... the mechanical part of this job
does not scare me too bad, but the really scary part is that I have NO real
concept of how timing works...

ok, here's what I'm thinking...

my car runs really good right now (except for the oil in the coolant tank
and the smoke that puffs off the exhaust when a drop or two of oil seeps
out the rear side of the engine onto the hot pipe...), but it runs real
good... Franz Blam Racing has done the work up until now (please engine,
forgive me, but I had to take this step...)

so, since the car runs well now, I'm thinking that the belts that are on
there now are correctly placed on there, and that they are my best hope
(besides tensioning them correctly) for returning the motor to a healthy
state of tune afterwards...

my plan is to execute a rib for rib swap of the new belts for the old belts
using dabs of some marking agent on the rollers, the old belts and the new
belts... to keep the relative positions...

it also sounds like after setting the engine to TDC, that I will not want
anything on the engine to move position... not the balance shaft, not the
camshaft, not the crankshaft... nothing...

freeze the engine position, swap the belts, set correct tension... I know
it won't be this easy, but am I abstractly right?

TIA,
