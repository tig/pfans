Hi Carl,

The risks you cite about a partial paint job are not those that
would concern me.    While overspray is always a possibility,
I would consider a bad color match a greater possibility.    The
new color computers do a decent job of scanning and matching
colors, but it's anybody's guess just how close they need to
get to satisfy a particular owner.   Complicating the challenge
is that silver metallic colors tend to fade unevenly and with
150K on the car, that's a lot of time for the sun to change things.

You are absolutely correct that a top drawer paint job should
include partial disassembly, and removal of all rubber seals,
etc.  Just bring money.  I think as long as you are ready to accept
some measure of color mismatch, then a couple of hundred dollars
spent to dress up the front is money well spent.

Good paint finishes are hard to achieve, and if you want to match the 
finish quality of an original Porsche paint job, then you will have to 
specifically instruct the paint shop.    Otherwise, you will likely end
up with sanding marks, orange peel, or whatever.   I sublet all my 
paint work to a specific shop that I was fairly unmerciful with until
they understood the product that was required.   Now that they 
have it down, they do wonderful work.   They also get paid well
for it.   

Good luck.

Dave
