Hi.  My name is Sam Matthews, and I'm living in NY.

I have a 1988 944 Turbo (not S) that I would like to sell, or trade for
an S2.

Black on Tan leather interior (no cracks).  Power everything. 
Autothority Stage II chip.  80K miles.

The car is in really good shape, and looks very nice.  I am the 3rd
owner (the 2nd owned the car for 2 months).  The owner before that lived
in South Carolina.  

The car has had a paint job (which is not the best), but also has a
*very* nice set of 993 alloy rims and 1 month old Dunlops.  Also, new
(not rebuilt) water pump 1 year ago, Timing/Balance shaft belt just
done.

I don't have all service records, but I went to Porsche with the VIN,
and they printed out a service history of the car which was very
extensive.

Car has never raced (aside from 2 autocross events).

As mentioned, I am looking to get me a 944 S2.  I don't care how it
looks so much, as long as it's mechanically sound.  I would love to
trade (as I would like to do continue autocrossing right away)

Asking $9,800

Regards,
Sam.
