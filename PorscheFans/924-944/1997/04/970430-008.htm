What a tribute.  Porsche really did get the lines right on this car.  I am
amazed at how I see the car after I have washed and detailed it.  What is
more amazing is how many people ask if it is a 1997 model!  It is truly a
timeless design; copied, yet never duplicated.

When I was a kid I used to feel that the Ferrari 250 GTO (the "real" GTO)
was the most beautiful car in the world.  As an adult (and I use that term
loosely) I still feel that the 250 is very special, but it is interesting
how similar the two are (944) in shape.  The GTO has made quite a mark in
history, however, the 944 has done more than just make a great mark.  It is
said that the value of an object is in its rarity.  And while the GTO, with
only a few dozen surviving examples left in the world, is a collectors'
trophy, Porsche has made the 944 the Peoples' treasure.  Even with the vast
number of 944s produced, it has done nothing to diminish the value of that
jewel.  That in itself is an engineering marvel.
