I'm sure they are.  However, they skip numbers, so it should be OK.  When
they start making the 999, maybe they'll design the 919, or recycle 959,
or whatever.  Lots of options.

I think they're doing this already, unless Porsche just happened to design
the 911 turbo *right before* the 924 turbo (930, 931).  (Also the 935.)
Since the 944 became the 951, following the trend established by the 924,
I think it's very likely that those wacky Germans are just picking numbers
they like.  ("OK, Fritz -- when's your wife's birthday?"  "The 24th."
"Okay, so this little car is christened the 924!  What *is* it, Otto?"
"My wife's birthday is the 31st!"  "Fine, fine.  We'll call the turbo
model the 931.")

BMW went from the 2002 to whatever the hell numbering scheme they use now,
so don't ask me to explain what they're doing.

What *is* it with strange foreign car numbers?  The 944, the 968,
the 959, the Volvo *five*-cylinder (too cheap for the sixth?), the 528e,
the 735is, the RX-7... kind of makes the six-cylinder (or eight, or
whatever) "Aurora" a rather placid and boring car, doesn't it?

(OK, I know, it'd be like that anyway.  But *still*...)

There was also, I believe, the 550 Spyder, of which the Boxster is a
partial derivative.  Very pretty car.

And I actually saw a 356 on the road a while back, so I know they exist.
Also pretty cars, though they're definitely on the heavy, bulbous side.
Sort of like a 911-for-the-fifties.
