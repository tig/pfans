Can't.  It'd be split too evenly.

Actually, the Porsche guy at Fathers & Sons is pretty cool about it.  He
doesn't mind if you sit in the 911s or play around with them a little.
All floor models, though, so test drives are pretty much out.

They had three 928s last time I checked, but I'm not really interested in
928s (Porsche *almost* had the look right!), so I didn't bother.

The parts guy it pretty good, too.  I asked him how much something silly
would cost, like the shade for the luggage compartment, and he told me to
sit down before he read the number.  Then we all had a good laugh over
"pull handles" and VWs.

				conversation, n.: a vocal competition
     icarus@berkshire.net	in  which the one who is catching his
				breath  is   called   the   listener.
