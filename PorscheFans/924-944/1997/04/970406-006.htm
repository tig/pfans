Absolutely not!  The R-134 refrigerant has a different boiling point, uses
different lubricants, and generally requires an entirely different design
than R-12.  Reports I've read indicate that attempting to install R-134
into an R-12 system without modification could result in an explosion,
compressor seizure, or generally causing you grief.  And aftermarket
conversions to R-134 are VERY expensive.  The problem with R-12 that
someone, somewhere (probably a bureaucrat looking for a crusade) decided
that R-12 was causing the ozone to decay (which, last time I checked, not
even top scientists could agree on), so they got Uncle Sam to ban it.
Uncle Sam has enough arm-twisting ability with the rest of the world to get
them to go along as well.

That said, there is a product out there which is supposed to be 100%
compatible with R-12 systems yet doesn't fall under the taxes and other
political problems that R-12 does.  It's being sold by Pennzoil, so it
shouldn't be one of these sham products that come and go in the night.
They're selling it as FR-12 and if you visit Pennzoil's web site
(www.pennzoil.com), you can get more info.  Stephen Magown
<magown@digimag.net> has tried the stuff and told me the following last
October:

>FR-12 actually works and it's cheap too. I bought a 30 lb. cylinder last
>summer for about $150. I ordered it one day then on the next an 18
>wheeler with Pennzoil written on the side  pulled up and delivered it. I
>don't know why they haven't advertised that much, but I'm pleased with
>their product. You don't have to change any fittings they're just doing
>that to make money, all you have to do is to screw in a fitting off of  a
>R-12 cylinder and you can use regular R-12 equipment. I found that ought
>after I bought $200 worth of fittings. Hope I was helpful if you have
>anymore questions e-mail me.

>Stephen Magown

You might write him to see if he's had any problems or reservations since
then.  Or maybe he could comment to the whole group?
