Content:  This letter is to ask for help on how to reinstall the clips
on the windshield washer hoses.

Hi List,

I put my windshield washer hoses and nozzles back on and they work fine
(with a little leaking), and now I need to reinstall the tiny hose
clamps to finish up the job.  My question is this:  There are two types
of clip, one which is a 'C' shaped spring clip (of which there are 4),
and one which is an 'O' shaped pinch clip (of which there are 6).  The
'O' clip goes on over the 'C' clip.  So, where do I put the 4 'C' clips
when there are 6 possible locations?  I assume that I place them on the
'upstream' side of the check valves, where there are 4 hose junctions
that I would assume would be highest in pressure.  Any other
suggestions?

Here's my poor man's diagram showing the hoses (as =), the clips (as O
and C), the 'T' check valve (as T), the 'L' check valve (as L), and the
Nozzles (as N).

                          =                   =
                          N                   N


P.S.  I'm at work today, so please respond directly if you can.  Thank
you!
