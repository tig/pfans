 Car 1979 924 2ltr.

I have Emailed the list before about the problem with my car and I need some
more advice. The car had been standing for four years before I bought it seven
months ago. The car starts and runs but there is a lack of power when driving.
It will only rev to 5,000 rpm in 1st 4,000 rpm in 2nd, 3,750 rpm in 3rd and
3,500 rpm in 4th. When not in gear it will rev all the way to 6,000 rpm
however, sometimes it won't and struggles to go above 5,000 rpm. The work I
have done to resolve the above is:
Check the timimg
Replace ignition coil
Replace distributor Cap, Condensor & points
Replace fuel/gas tank, fuel pump, accumulator & fuel lines
Checked injectors
Checked fuel flow rate = correct amount
Checked plugs and leads
Replaced fuel filter
Checked warm-up reg, cold start valve & air valve = all ok
Checked sensor plate = set in the correct position

All of the above has had no affect on the problem. Any ideas??
