Karl,

My condolences.  This is VERY corrosive stuff.  The only paint  
defect when
I bought my car was a 3/4" round stain on the hood from bird  
droppings.  "No
problem" I thought, "I'll just compound it out." WRONG!!  Bird  
droppings soften
the paint and the hit area came down *fast* with rubbing compound.   
Very alarming -
and I never continued to the bottom of the stain.  Live with it --  
consider it a
character mark.
