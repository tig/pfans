Hey nice try Chuck. Bonus points for the first answer.
In my clutch replacement project I have replaced the shift lever already. (quoted at $70 from local dealer and around $45 from usual mail order sources (performance, tweeks, Atlanta and finally purchased from Sonnen Porsche (415-454-3911) for the grand total of $30.40!!) Free tip of the day - if you need to replace this part look to see if the opening in the rod that goes to the transmission has been ovalized. Mine was and I fixed it by adding metal via Mig welding and then redrilling the hole to the correct size.
ANYWAY - My problem still exists here is some additional info since learned - The vibration is actually centered at approx 3900 rpm and has a fairly narrow Q (its back to normal by 3500 and 4500 rpm.) I don't know wether the loud exhaust is related. I didn't put many miles on this car before taking it apart to fix the clutch. The exhaust note in 4th or 5th gear at cruise seems much louder (at low frequency) that I would thought normal.  The vibration seems to be there when the engine is  run at 4000 rpm with the clutch depressed but at a significantly lower amplitude. To me this seems to indicate an unbalanced pressure plate (but that does seem unlikely) The only other thought is the the exhaust system could cause this if it were not isolated from the body (?))
Any comments from an experienced 944na owner? If there exists an owner near Syracuse NY I would love to do a quick comparison of how our vehicles run. Fine tuning one of these can be real fun with out a baseline (control group?)  to compare  with. I wouldn't mind traveling an hour or so. I'll buy the beer / whatever.
