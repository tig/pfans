I know this has been discussed previously, but I can't seem to find it in the
archvives, so please pardon the bandwidth.

Once a 944 dash starts to crack, is there anything to apply on it to prevent
further decay?  The 1/4" cracks around the defogger vents seem to be growing
wider this spring.  I keep the dash covered religiously to avoid the UV and
sun scorch, but it appears that something else must be done at this point.

Secondly, is there a limit to the cracks?  I mean, are these things going to
go 4-5"?

Lastly, can anyone take a WAG as to the percentage of dashes that *do* crack?
 And of those, what percentage do something about it?

Thanks...
Carl
