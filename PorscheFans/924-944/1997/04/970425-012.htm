Sam -- 

The answer to your question depends in part on what kind of tracks you're
going to race.  On slower tracks, my S2 and I get beat in the corners by na
944s and 944Ss with better drivers, but I can pass them in the short
straights.  And vice versa, I can crawl up the bumpers of worse Turbo
drivers in the corners, and they can outpace the S2 on the straights.  I
haven't driven any really fast tracks, but I bet a Turbo would really shine
on long straights.  Given a mix of tracks and equal driving ability, it
doesn't make much difference which car you race as long as you can adapt
your technique to the power band of the car, particularly when exiting
turns.  Real serious track folks spend a lot of time worrying about
changing gear ratios to suit a particular track.  

IMHO, relax and enjoy.  The 951 is a dynamite car.  And getting an S2 isn't
going to make you better driver.
