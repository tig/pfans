Have been following this one with some interest........Since you already have 
the Turbo, keep it and learn to drive it........For those of you who are 
wondering which one to get for track events......here's an observation.   
I have a 83 944na, set up for Club Racing and TTrials.  I often outrun the 
turbos in time trials.  Usually the ones I outrun have pilots who are 
learning.  The turbos that Club race usually have more experienced drivers so, 
with a few exceptions, they're faster than me. 
 
If you're a novice, it takes a bit longer to go faster in a faster car.  
Reason being, in a  low powered car, your perspective is to sustain momentum 
thru corners or you slow down big time.  In a hi powered car your perspective 
is too slow the damn thing down so you can get thru the corner...  There's a 
difference of at least 100hp between a NA 944 and a Turbo. The difference in 
driver perspectives has a very visible impact on lap times and driving 
styles.... 
 
The novices in the turbos generally park in the corners and blast down the 
straights.  The novices in the non turbos can't blast down the straights so 
they first learn to attack the corners and exit with the most momentum 
possible.  The novices in the turbos often learn this last and later from my 
observation..... 
 
Now, when the driver who has learned to drive the low powered car gets into a 
car with HP......he already knows how to get the car thru the corners...and 
he's usually faster in the higher powered car a lot sooner..... 
 
So, if you didn't already own a Turbo, I'd vote for the S2 for you.....I'm in 
my second year with the NA car and its been dependable, fun, fast and always a 
pleasure to drive.........and I'm not a novice by a long shot.....
