Hi P-fans, I noticed a couple of days ago that my '86 951 had mysteriously
began losing coolant. I checked around the hoses, waterpump etc, and
everything was dry. I  rechecked the coolant tank and there was only about
one inch of  coolant in it and I noticed the car never got hot.  After a trip
to my repair shop and a pressure test, all I needed was a new radiator cap.
It seems the car only lost coolant when I drove because the old cap let
coolant escape when the engine was hot. The shop said this was a common
occurance and that these caps should be replaced every couple of years
because they get weak . Colin F.
