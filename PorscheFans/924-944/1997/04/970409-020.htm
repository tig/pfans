I had been using BFG 245/45-16s all the way around on my S2 M030 car
since I bought it last fall.  I was pretty happy with the BFG tires, but
not particularly happy with their service (dating back to my Audi
quattro days).  I really wanted to try a different tire size combo to
fit larger tires on the rear to limit the oversteer.  Kumho offers a
265/45-16 for the rear of the car and their 245/45s are wider than the
BFGs.  The rears do not rub, although it is veeerrrrrrryyyy close!  The
front inside sidewalls do rub inside the wheel wells at full lock....
not too bad though.

I ran these tires at the Atlanta Tour and I was very happy with the
tires.  The car was far from perfect as I did not adjust the suspension
at all since changing to the new combo.  The car understeered a bit too
much and I drove pretty poorly.  I finished third, but I know I could
have won if I drove better.  Anyway, I really liked the feel of the
tires and they seemed to be much more contollable at the limit and
beyond (ie sliding).

I have made some additional changes to the suspension since that race so
hopefully the car will be better this weekend at the Pro Solo in
Nashville.  Is anyone else going to this race?

I will report my findings next week.  I do think the Kumhos are worth a
shot.
