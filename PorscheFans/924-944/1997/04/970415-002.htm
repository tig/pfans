Wes,

        Am feeling deep sorrow for your misfortunes.  Did you have a really
elaborate stereo system?  If you did have a stereo with satellite equipment,
it is often covered under homeowner's insurance and not car insurance.
Typically, only the head unit is covered by car insurance policies.  I would
check the receipts for your stereo and "misc." items to evaluate whether or
not you should claim them as losses.  And consider this amount with any
repairs you will want to make.  The insurance company should allow you to
use your own discretion in choosing how and to what degree you will fix the
damages.  They will probably pay for most of it, but the more you claim, the
higher your premium will be when they may decide to change your vehicle's
classification to one with a "high and expensive risk" for claims.  Hope
things work out for you.  At least they didn't steal the car...

Sincerely,
Ben

a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
