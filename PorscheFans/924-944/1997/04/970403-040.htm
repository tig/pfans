Was this posted on April Fool's Day, by chance?

Reminds me of the time Candid Camera did a show, in which they offered a "1/2
price special" to change the air in customers' tires.  $5.00 instead of the
normal $10.00!

Several people took 'em up on the offer.  They asked questions like, "How far
can I go between air changes?", "Could that be why my car has been riding
rough?", and my favorite, "I probably should have it done, because I bought
this car from a guy in Canada, and I think I should have U.S. air in the
tires"

P.T. Barnum was right!
