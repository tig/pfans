Today I came home in my Turbo S and I was driving in a very casual way for
about 10 miles through town.  The ambient temperature was 60 degrees F and
at the red light I decided to take advantage of an offer the fellow next to
me at the light had extended.

After giving him a sizable head start, I had a change of heart and
depressed the throttle down and waited for the turbo to spool up.  I should
have given him more than the 2 - 3 second lead before leaving the light, so
I blew by him like a bullet and kept going until I had used up a portion of
third gear, then coasted down for the next light.

At that time I noticed the smell of antifreeze, but it soon disappeared and
the car seemed normal for the lazy cruise home.  The water temperature did
not indicate anything abnormal, and the cooling fans only ran for about one
minute (max) after stopping the car.

Once home I looked at the coolant level and saw it was over the max line
and sitting up at the cap.  I thought I might be looking at coolant-oil
mixing, but there was no evidence of oil in the plastic tank, and the oil
in the engine was fine.  After an hour of sitting the coolant has dropped
below the max line again and the oil level is still the same.  Again, there
is no evidence of mixing in either part of the system.

The age of the water pump, thermostat, and cap are unknown, but the car
does not overheat by the gauge.  The heater on this car has not been very
good this winter (I bought the car two months ago), but there is no sound
of air in the system when starting or reving the engine.

I cracked open the cap to check for oil mixing just after I had stopped, so
some coolant pushed out of the overflow tube, but the amount was only a few
ounces.

Why would the coolant system behave this way?

Is this symptomatic of any known failure mode?

Could the filler cap be weak?

Anybody have any thoughts?

Thanks in advance,

Marv
