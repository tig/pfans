I had the opposite problem this weekend on the track. I had an instructor
w/ me who's a very good driver. He had me accelerating hard and early out
of tight corners.  On tight second gear turns, I had the OUTSIDE rear wheel
spinning like crazy. I don't have LSD on my 944 S2, and was wondering if
might help in this situation.  

I agree with a previous comment about experienced drivers being able to
work around the lack of LSD with technique, and my technique leaves
something to be desired because it was my first time on the track w/ R1s
and I wasn't using them to their full potential - i.e., not carrying enough
speed into the turn, turning too sharply and not using up the track on the
exit.  I was driving correctly for street tires, but not for track tires. 
Once I started going in hotter and drifting on the exit, the tire spinning
disappeared.

Anyway, it was a great track day. But the more you learn, the more you
learn you have to learn. The main thing they beat into me this time was to
carry more speed into turns, downshift less, and even if you feel like
you're bogging at low rpms on the exit, you're still going faster.
