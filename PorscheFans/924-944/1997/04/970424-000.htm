     Wow. what a subject line.
     
     AnyWay, I caught the post about front wheel bearings.
     
     Packing bearings is not something to be taken for granted. If the 
     grease does not get fully impacted behind/above/and around all the 
     rollers, the bearing life will be dramatically impacted.
     
     An accepted method for hand packing bearings is as follows: 
     
     (reverse hand descriptions if yer a lefty)
     
     Clean and dry your hands thoroughly. The smallest contaminant will 
     kill a timken roller.
     
     Place a moderate amount of grease in the open palm of you left hand.
     
     Hold the clean, dry bearing in your right hand, with the wider 
     diameter towards you.
     
     Press the far edge of the bearing into the leading edge of the grease 
     in the palm of you hand, using a Press/Scoop action, sliding the 
     bearing towards you. As you work, you may find it easier to get the 
     greas in by pulling the inner race away from the retainer with your 
     thumb.
     
     The idea and goal is to work the grease in and behind the rollers 
     until it oozes out from behind the roller, between the top of the 
     roller and the retainer. It is important that all the rollers have 
     grease "tongues" at the top, and bottom if you can.
     
     Greasing the spindle is completely unnecessary, as the last thing you 
     want is the inner race spinning at all.  A very light coat of grease 
     will help you mount the hub, however.
     
     I hope this helps anyone else repacking or replacing wheel bearings.
     
     Yours in the Stuttgart spirit,
