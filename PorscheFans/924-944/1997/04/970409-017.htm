I had one side go, then the other.  It may be the check valves - white
plastic assemblies just upstream from the washer jets.  When they fail,
they can either stick open (and your jets dribble) or clog (and you
get a wimpy flow).  They're cheap (can replace both for under $10), 
and easy to replace, so that's a
good place to start.

I'd tried cleaning the washer jets with wire,
and that didn't fix it.  So I disconnected the hoses at the downstream
end of the check valves, and at the washer pump.  Then blew air into
the washer pump end of the hose.  The resistance was so great, that I
figured the check valves were clogged.  I replaced them and they're fine
now.

I wonder - aloud - if any particular brand of washer additive is  
less likely
to clog/damage the valves.
