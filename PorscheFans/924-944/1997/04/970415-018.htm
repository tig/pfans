If there are any 944 turbo lovers out there  I have a 1986 944 turbo for
sale.
I am the original owner.  I must sell it because I need to purchase a
pickup for our business.
The Porsche has 73000 original miles.  It is guards red and gray leather
interior.  Has an
automatic sunroof the you can remove.  It also has drivers lumbar
adjustable seat.  Never been
in an accident although my neighbor backed into it while it was parked. 
Had to have it repainted
on drivers side.  The car is in excellent condition.  I have Porsche MOMO
rims on the car.  Looks sharp.
I am located in Modesto California if anyone is interested please call me
at 209-522-93090 ask for Dave
or Loretta, or you can e-mail me at ifc@joshuanet.com  asking price$13,500

I also have all service records on car.  It has always had required
maintenance on it.
Thanks,
Loretta
