In a message dated 97-04-18 23:59:09 EDT, you write:

<< In my search for
 tires, I've turned up a surprise - 205-55 and 225-50 ZR 16s have
 24.7" outside diameter (o.d.), whereas 245-45 ZR16s have 24.4" o.d.
 (Numbers for Bridgestone S0-2s, I naively assume they're the same
 for other manufacturers.)
 I don't suppose the .3" makes any noticable difference, but lots of
 folks run 225/245 combo (e.g. standard on the 89 turbo) - wonder if the
 cars were set up level. >>

You're right that the .3" difference isn't significant -- it's only
a 1.2% difference in diameter, and only changes the ride
height by .15".  Tread wear and tire pressure variations can
affect the ride hide by that amount. Which brings me to my 
second point --  do-it-yourself ride height adjustment is not an
exact science.  You need to take out as many variables as possible,
but in the end you'll find, I think, that "close enough" is the best
you'll be able to do, and is good enough for MOST purposes. 
Variables include:
--the surface you're working on.  It should be as level and as flat as
possible.
--tire size and pressure
--reference points for measuring. For example, the rocker panels aren't
  uniformly flat underneath.  I prefer to measure from the center of the
wheel 
   hub to the lip of the fender directly above, but that's not exact either.
   It'll give you a better read on chassis balance (independent of wheels,
   tires, etc) but you then need to take a second set of measurements
   at the rocker panel to see about rake.
Which brings me to my third point -- this stuff is more complicated than
you might at first think.  Any chassis/suspension change you make will
affect other settings, in ways you may not expect.  For example, you may
get your rake and ride height set just right, and completely screw up
your corner balance in the process.  Since corner balance can have a bigger
impact on handling than rake and ride height (within limits, of course), all
your hard work could net you worse handling.  Now, for street driving, other 
than the fact that screwed up corner balance can cause your car to pull to 
one side, most of this is pretty much academic.  For track and autocross,
however, properly adjusting these parameters can provide a competitive
advantage,  which leads to...
Point four -- there are some excellent sources of information out there on
this subject.  To gain an understanding of performance  chassis/suspension
setup, HOW TO MAKE YOUR CAR HANDLE, by Fred Puhn, is a terrific
resource (I'm sure there are others, but I'm familiar with this one).  For
an excellent description of  how to align your Porsche, order the little
booklet you may have seen advertised in the back of Pano and Excellence --
HOME ALIGNMENT OF PORSCHE ___(fill in the blank; 944,924,968, 911,914) 
FOR COMPETITION OR STREET, by Ray Scruggs.  It's a terrific value at
$10 plus $2 shipping (no interest -- I just find it really useful)  
Even if you don't plan to do your own 4 wheel alignment
(an 8 hr job by Ray Scruggs' estimate for a complete job!!!),
you may play with some easier settings on your own (eg, front toe, front
camber 
or rear ride height).  To order, send $12, your address and your car model 
to Ray Scruggs, 20-A Scenic Ave, San Rafael, CA, 94901.  When I ordered
mine, he also sent me a booklet of autocross/Solo II tips that was pretty
informative.

Long post, but I hope it added value.
