I don't recall this issue being discussed but it wouldn't surprise me if it
has; if so forgive my resurrecting it. 

Going through my recent Imparts catelogue, I notice they had two entries for
a small bottle of pink fluid with a name like "Water Wetter" which claims to
lower coolant temperatures by as much as 30 degrees F.  There are times when
my series I 944, with its reletively small radiator, runs toward the high
end of the scale and lowering the highs by 30 degrees would be great.

My question(s):  Does this stuff work?  If it does, how?  Does it reduce
temperatures across the full range of operating temperatures? What's the
down side?   On a different car, I recall a lowering of normal operating
temperatures when I went from regular to synthetic oil.  Lower friction
could account for these lower temperatures, but I'm just not clear on this
pink stuff.  Anybody out there got an answer?

(BTW  my search for a 911 continues and my SO will buy the Blue 944, so I
won't really have to get rid of it!)
