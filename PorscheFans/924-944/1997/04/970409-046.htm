To all,

I'm new at this so bear with me.  I've just purchased my first Porsche . . .
.. a 1984 944NA.  Basically, the car is in really nice shape.  It has been
garaged and maintained very well both cosmetically and mechanically (with
only a few exceptions).  It looks GREAT and it handles REALLY GREAT and the
hardest thing for me to do is to wipe the silly grin off my face whenever I
drive it!  I know the motor mounts need to be replaced and I'd like to do it
myself (I'm fairly competent with a wrench . . . . . I rebuilt the engine on
my 1967 Jaguar XK-E).  My question is regarding the exact procedure.  I've
been told that with the car up on stands that I can lift the engine enough
with a floor jack to remove the old mounts and slip in the new ones.  Is this
all there is to it?  Are there any secrets or caveats that I should be aware
of?  How long should this take (for a normal person with a reasonable amount
of manual dexterity)?

The second question is about intermittent gas fumes in the driver's
compartment.  It doesn't seem to correlate to the amount of gas in the tank
or the temperature of the engine or whether the car is being pushed hard or
just cruising.  When the fumes are present in the driver's compartment I
can't smell them in the engine compartment.  I've checked in the spare tire
area and there's no gas fumes there either.  I'm stumped as to where they're
coming from.  Can anyone help me??????

Thanks in advance for any help.  This is a great forum for info exchange.
