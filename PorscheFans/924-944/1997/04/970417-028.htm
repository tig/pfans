Hi All,

I've got 3 unrelated 944 questions.  Before I start I should tell you the
car is an 85.5 944 (83k miles) with 7.5X15 and 8.5X15 Fuchs.  All four rims
have Bridestone Potenza P215-60's.

I'm going to start drivers ed and auto-x programs next month.  Is the
current tire setup on my car going to cause any major problems for these
events?  When the car is ready for new tires, should I put 205/55-15's in
the front and 225/50-15's in the back?  If I do this, will it screw up my
speedo/odo because there will be a difference of about 33mm (16.5x2) or
about 1.3" of sidewall height.  Also, I may just decide to purchase a set
of 16" rims and fit them with some type of R1 tire.  I'd love to find some
16" Fuchs at a decent price but since the rims will only be on the car for
events it won't matter to me that much.  Any ideas of what a nice looking,
well made, not-to-overly expensive rim would be for this car?  (geez the
questions are piling up).

Next...

I've started to notice, mainly when the car is cold, a cv clicking type
sound from the right rear wheel area.  It intensifies when I turn left but
seems to disappear at higher speeds and when the car has been run for about
15 minutes.  Sometimes the sound is never heard.  I checked the car's
records and the PO had the car at Automobile Atlanta on 11/92 (69k miles)
for a rear end noise.  AA R&R'd the CV Shafts and packed the bearings. 
They did make a note suggesting all CV's be replaced.  How can you tell
after removing the CV's if they need replaced or if they can be repacked? 
Also, any preferences regarding new vs. rebuilt CVs?

Lastly...

How can you tell if a 944 has been lowered?  How much space should there be
between my tires and the wheel well?

TIA - sorry for all the BW
