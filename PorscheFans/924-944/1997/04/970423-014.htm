William,
        I think what you are describing is an arm that holds the power 
steering pump, and mounts on the lower balance shaft. If you remove the timing 
belt cover, you will gain a better view of it. If the lower balance shaft 
seals were bad, you would see oil here.
  The oil-water heat exchanger (oil cooler) is located behind this arm, on the 
left side of the engine while standing in front of the car. It is below the 
exhaust manifold. The oil filter screws into it. If the oil-water heat 
exchanger housing seal were going, you would see coolant leaking, not oil. 
When removing the oil filter, oil will spill out on both the oil-water heat 
exchanger, and the aforementioned arm. Make sure it isn't residual oil you are 
seeing.
  I just replaced my lower balance shaft seals, along with the crank, cam, 
upper balance shaft, etc... The o-rings were no-longer springy, and even had 
cracks. The races and shaft seals looked to be ok, but I replaced them. There 
is also a very thin clear plastic seal (looks like a thin clear washer) which 
goes on the shaft between the race and the plain bearing. Make sure you 
replace this as well if you end up replacing the seals.

I am still not sure exactly where the leak is that you are describing. I could 
fax you some drawings if need be.

Let me know if this helps.
