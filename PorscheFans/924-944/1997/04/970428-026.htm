There is a significant price advantage in replacing the seals. However,
if you go to a garage, they will want to use a rebuild, because they do
not want to risk doing the job twice. Check out the bore of the
cylinder. If it is corroded (pitted, black) you may need a new one. If
it is smooth (but not necessarily 'shiny'), new seals may do the trick.
Honing the cylinder will make new seals seat better - but clean it
thoroughly!   

While your'e at it, renew the seals in the slave too, if that isn't done
lately. Seals are about the same age and life expectancy for the slave
is about the same as for the master.

No need to worry. It is a sloppy fit 'by design' - quite normal and
correct.
