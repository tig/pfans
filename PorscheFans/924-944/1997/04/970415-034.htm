Some also like to remove the horn fuses but I like to leave it on in case
someone gets lost in the course and heads towards me (happened at
least once).

Other German cars have the same characteristics. My experience is with
early 80's 3-series BMWs.  My friend and I played a lot with his 315i and
ended up removing the fuse for the wipers on it, too. 
 
In the heat of the a-x, lots of things tend to happen.  Though it was not a
Porsche, I would like to relay the following CB conversation that I participated in
one of last year's St. Louis Region SCCA a-x while working in the corners:
"Were those the backup lights that I saw on that Passat VR6?????"

Fun times!!!!
