Could you possibly provide a short description of this device?  Sounds
interesting for my son's car.

Sure, I believe it is the same air dam that Farzaan mentioned a 
week or so back.  It mounts to the bottom of the front fascia and
has a lip which protrudes towards the front.  It extends out perhaps
3 cm at a 45 degree angle towards the front of the car.  Of course,
it looks like it will get scratched up over time due to the fact that
it is so low, but it sure looked nice on the car.  The shop quoted
around $250 for the part, but I believe Farzaan found it for less.
It will also need to be painted before being attached to the car.

Clark
