Hi Clark,

I currently have a K-27 turbo on my car.  In fact, my K-27 is blowing more oil
into my intercooler than I would like.  Hopefully I'll be able to rebuild it
before the summer is over.

The difference in price between the K-26 and the K-27 is minimal.  My turbo was
$1200, the PO bought it when he had the 2.8l andial conversion done.  You can
probably buy rebuilt ones for ~$800.

Unless you have any other modifications done to your car, the k-27 probably
isn't going to do a lot to the performance of your car.  In fact you'll
probably loose some low end power do to increased turbo lag.  At the high end,
the turbo should able to decrease lag, off the throttle excursions will not be
as bad because the turbo will be able to fill the manifold faster when you get
back on the throttle.

If you have to replace the turbo (and don't just want to rebuild yours) you can
go ahead and try the K-27.  I'm satisfied with it (other than it leaks),
however my car has a greater engine displacement, I also have a modified
exhaust, the exhaust from the turbo is almost a 4 inch pipe...so there isn't
(shouldn't be) as much bottle neck going out the exhaust.

Some applications of the k-27 turbo allow for the exhaust to be a bottle neck
so the turbo doesn't get used effectively (I think Farzaan pointed out a case
once).  If you plan more modifications in the future, go ahead and get the
K-27.  However for now, I don't think you'll notice as much of an increase in
power.

Have fun!
