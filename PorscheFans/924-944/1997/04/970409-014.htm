Hey dudes,

I thought I'd give a data point to you.  My buddy with the 88 944 Turbo S
has been having some reliability problems.  I'd been using him as an example
to other owners of other cars because his Turbo S has been so reliable, but
lately, it looks like some deferred maintenance has ended up costing a lot
more because it was overlooked for so long.

He has had his steering rack replaced because some seal was leaking and
he didn't look after it until it became unbearable.  He also has a dead
2nd gear synchro (don't worry, he doesn't lift the throttle when he shifts,
so don't expect problems with yours if you drive normal).  The shop stuck
in some friction modifier to help shifting and it seems to have helped.

The final thing happened two days ago.  His car was hard to start, when
it finally turned over, the car was puffing tons of white smoke, blown
head gasket.  It's in the shop right now getting a new gasket put in.
When the shop pulled off the manifold, they found lots of raw fuel in
there from leaky injectors apparently.

The car has had a HARD life so it's not too bad.  The car has seen about
three track days, 100's of autocrosses, a 170mph blast across Montana
(with pictures!) and about 40,000 miles of driving since he bought it
when it had 50,000 miles on it.

Thought I'd give you a data point.  Just for clarity, this is not my
car or Paul's, it's another member of our racing club.

I think the poor guy is gonna autocross his Infinity J30 this weekend!

Farzaan.

PS - Paul and I are trying out some Kumho race tires this weekend.  I'll
let you know how they compare to the Hoosier.  Paul also got his S0-2
rubber with 17" 993 wheels.  I'll stick pics up on the web soon.  The
tread looks absolutely WILD.  Thanks to Scotty White for allowing us the
opportunity to test the Kumhos.  I have a feeling both Paul and I will
be running them in the future.
