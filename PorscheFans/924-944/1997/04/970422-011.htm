Sam--

I love my S2, but sometimes lust after a 951 or a 911. A very common
disease.  The merits of the S2 are that it does have great low-end torque
and the fact that you're not tempted to get a stroker mod or something else
equally expensive for the 951.  I live above 7000 ft in Wyoming, and my S2
still climbs fairly easily to 145 mph.  Sometimes I wish I had a Turbo to
decrease 0-100 mph times, but top speed isn't my main passion.  On the
track, the S2 bails me out of a lot of mistakes in the corners w/ the
low-end torque, buts it's also great for passing on the straights.  The
thing really squats on its rear wheels and moves when you stomp it hard.
With my driving technique slowly improving, I find that I can eliminate
some downshifts because of the torque, focus on the braking, and still have
enough rpms to accelerate out of a corner.  

On the other hand, in the Rocky Mt Region PCA, a certain 944 Turbo is still
legendary for holding a lot of track records.  But I've heard the good
Turbo drivers have to do some fancy left foot braking to keep the revs up
in the turns. 

I can't solve your dilemna, but I can tell you that I traded my late '85
944 in when I got the S2, and now I wish I'd kept it for a dedicated track
car.  Unless you really don't like the performance characteristics of your
Turbo, I'd suggest you hold on to it, bite the bullet, and buy an S2.  You
can always sell one later. 

Or look at it from this perspective. My last driving instructor drives a
'72 911 that has no more than 200 hp, but his technique is great and he
posts top times.  It's a real trip to watch him exiting a corner right on
line with the inside front wheel about 6 inches off the ground. He'll never
beat the RSs and 993 turbos, but he's getting everything out of his car. 
And he doesn't seem to be lusting after another ride.  He's learned how to
dance with the car he's got.
