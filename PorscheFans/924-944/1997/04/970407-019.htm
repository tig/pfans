Hey dudes,

I had my first really bad day in the Porsche at an auto-x.  I can't just
tell you all of the fun stuff, I have to give you the bad side too, when
I do sh*tty :(

I'm gonna call it the Curse of Kent.  First, let me set you up with the
excuses, then I'll go into the day's events.  I got about 2 hours of sleep,
drove 3 hours to the event and then didn't get to run until the afternoon
(Paul's class ran in the morning and we wanted to drive down together).
I think I had sun-stroke, starvation and lack of sleep.

So, Paul goes out in a class called Street-Mod which is a "run what you
brung" class.  He did this because he intends on running race tires later
on and it made the most sense.  He could have run BP (and in hindsight,
he should have since he was faster), but we didn't want to run against
each other this year to keep costs down.  We kept one-upping each other
last couple of years in our Talons eventually driving costs up to the point
where each car was costing C$900 a month to run!

Paul was running on street AVS intermediate Yokohama tires.  His first
run, he was really flying, even Bill Buetow made a comment about the
section he saw of that run.  Paul came in with a 52.2 on street tires!
His second run, he went out and overdrove or drove offline or something
and came in with a 53.5.  The third and final run (this was a regional),
he went out and drove a 53.6 and one cone.  I think the course was such
that it was highly technical, in that if you missed a line in one corner,
the remainder of the course no longer flowed and your run was toast.  Karen
Babb designed the course and I personally found it very difficult, but
the guys with more experience didn't seem to have problems.  It looks
like Paul nailed it on his first run, but then could not get on that line
again for the remainder.

I then went up in the afternoon.  First run out was complete brain fade,
I actually got lost on the track, something that I don't normally do :(
I was really flying through the first section which I remembered.  The
next run, I decided to take it pretty easy and get a clean time in so 
that if there was anyone else in "B Prepared", I would have a chance of
being close.  I ended up with a 53.5 on RACE tires :(  It's not that the
car wasn't sticking, in fact, I think I'm pretty happy with the Hoosiers,
they felt really good.  Last run, I pushed a bit harder, but confidence
was eroded by that first run, and I only came in with a 52.6 or something
crappy like that, so I lost to Paul with his STREET tires :(

This is now the third time I've lost at the Kent site.  Last year, I lost
in the Talon challenge, I had this 300hp monster car, and I lost to a 
270hp car with normal aftermarket suspension.  Then, this year, I lost
in the rain to Paul (this was acceptable as the Hoosiers weren't too
good on puddles compared to Paul's street tires) and then I lost again
yesterday in the dry :( :( :(  It's bizarre, on RACE tires at Bremerton,
I blew the doors off Paul, but here I lost.

We have another event at Tradex, Abbotsford this coming weekend and
if it's dry, I'm gonna be going all out to kick Paul's butt!

BTW - about the subject line, I was the only competitor in BP

Farzaan.
89 951 (even the boost couldn't help me this time).
