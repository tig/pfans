Sounds like the plastic rod that goes from the lock motor to your lock
mechanism itself has either broken or fallen loose from its ball & socket
joint.  You'll have to remove the passenger side door panel and the
components shouldn't be too hard to recognize.  Luckily, if you problem is
in fact just the rod, you can buy a new plastic rod alone for under $10.
Labor to remove door panel, fix, and replace the panel will be about an hour
to an hour and a half.  You can do this one yourself if you know how to get
that door panel off and on carefully (Haynes?).  Hope this helps...
