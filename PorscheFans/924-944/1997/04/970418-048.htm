No, if you're trying to get as much power to the ground as possible without
wheel spin, the LSD is the best aid for even the best of drivers to allow
that. When we talk LSD we're talking about mechanical locking mechanisms
inside the differential which for some range of load cause the diff to lock.
Not to be confused with electronic traction control, which I would argue
is also valuable at some power/weight ratio.
