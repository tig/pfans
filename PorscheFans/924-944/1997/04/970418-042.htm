<< I happened to be at my local domestic auto parts place to pick up some
 Loctite, but got distracted by the "Monroe" shock sale display in the same
 aisle.  Well I looked through the applications book and what do I see - a
 listing for 944 as well as the turbo, 83 to 88 (will only fit cars without
 the M474 option).  Hmm.. gas charged shocks for $52 CDN.($36 US)      What
 is the lowdown on these shocks - anybody know?  I do not use my 84 944NA
 for anything more strenuous than the groceries,  so is it a candidate for
 "Monroes"?  Would anybody like to comment.  BTW only fronts are listed.  >>

They will work right?,  but:
I have KONIS installed by myself in my 1983 944.

After about 100,000 miles of use the shock (actually  the strut) failed by
getting a little wobble in it.  My alignment shop spotted it and KONI
replaced the struts free, and I installed them again.

Also, the shocks are VERY important to a sports car's feel.  Putting MONROES
in a Porsche is like Dennis Rodman playing with WalMart sneakers.  (I wear
WalMart sneakers...$15)

But the Monroes would certainly take you to buy groceries for years to come
(albeit without the fun)....  :(

Buy the KONIS...  :)
