I've owned my 85.5 944 (83k) a month now.  I tried the A/C out when I
purchased it and it seemed to blow very cold air.  Over the weekend I
turned it on and the air was not very cold.  The outside temp was around
75.

Checking the service records from the PO, I have the following tickets from
Auto Cool in Smyrna Ga:
6/3/92 - 63k - Replaced A/C condensor, add oil to system, evacuate, charge
& leak check system. $453.56

12/29/95 - 79k - Complete A/C checkout, evacuate, charge, & leak check
system, add oil to compressor, reclaim the R-12.  Remove the compressor
assembly to disassemble and replace the shaft seal.  Replace the
filter-drier.  Evacuate, charge, & leak check system.  $426.04

5/28/96 - Miles not stated - Relcaim the R-12.  Disassemble, clean, and
reseal the inlet fitting on the condensor.  Evacuate, charge, & leak check
the system.  $113.64

This sounds like one of a couple of things wrong to me.  Either this A/C
shop doesn't have a clue how to seal an A/C system or there is something
wrong they haven't yet found.  I'm very reluctant to take my car back to
this place because they've already soaked the PO for about a $1000 and the
problem still exists.

I've always heard from owners of MB's and BMW's, and I'm not trying to
start a flame war, that the one area German cars fall down is with Air
Conditioning.  I have a friend who has owned several MB's and he is forever
cussing the Germans - "they can't build an A/C system for shit".  

I'm wondering if this is a common problem with Porsches.  I've never owned
a car where I had to give the A/C system a second look.  Just sold a '88
Honda Accord coupe with 212k miles and never had to have the system
recharged until 175k.

Any insight to this problem will be greatly appreciated.
