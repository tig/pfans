Hi everybody,

I was driveing down a wide windy road and decided to go a little faster.
the road veered to the left and then down a hill and back to the right
fairly sharply... As i was going around the turn to the right and down
the hill at the same time, the car just died! it handled great and 
i don't think i ever even lost traction, but it died! okay so i was
going in third at over 5500 rpm.  I was wondering if there was a cut
off switch on the engine so you can't redline it, or if you know
of any other reasons for this sudden stall, i would greatly appreciate
hearing from you.

The car is in great condition its an 84 944, non turbo and all stock
with 130 thousand miles on it.  It wasn't over heating nor was it low
on oil or oil pressure.  Its just killing me...

thank you,

kevin
