If you absolutely have to have a manual, it is in stock in microfiche 
form - and it is only about $18 or so.  You can read it at the library, and 
make copies of relevent pages for your personal use.  Microfiche readers 
are commonly available used as office surplus.. relatively inexpensive.

I would love to see someone scan it and put the images on CD ROM but.. 
copyrights are still in place regardless of availability, sad to say.  
For individual use this may be acceptable (fair use) but if someone were 
to sell the CD's.. they would be in legal hot water.

However, if this shortage continues, PCNA may be contending with black 
market copies, if they continue to strangle us in this fashion.

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.  Manual on 'fiche.
