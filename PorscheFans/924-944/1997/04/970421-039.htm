William,
       From what you describe, it sounds like a leak from the infamous
oil cooler. (I assume when you say to the left of the oil cooler, you
were standing in front of the vehicle, and meant your left which is the
right side of the engine.)  Before I write more, can you provide a more
detailed description? The oil cooler cover is on the right side of the
engine, to the rear of the power steering pump, below the exhaust
manifold. It is boxy, and has a heat shield held on by two bolts. It is
probably covered with oil from oil changes when the oil filter dumps all
over the place.

Good Luck,
