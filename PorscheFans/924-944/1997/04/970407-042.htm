Yep.

On the passenger side foot well, at the top under the dash, is a white
"Molex" connector that goes no where.  It has three connectors in it and
the center one is the test pin.  If you look at the end it will look like
this with three holes in it.  Inside each hole is a metal contact:
   _____________
  / 1   2   3  |
  \____________|

Pin # 2 is where you must connect a wire and run it to the drivers seat.
Connect a ground lead (I used the metal door latch on the passenger door)
from ground and run it to the drivers seat.  You will do a series of
connections and disconnection to the two ends of the wires to perform the
Air Bag reset procedure, so go ahead and take a seat in the drivers seat
and have your keys ready.  Oh, you will need a watch with a second hand to
count time.  Remember that this is a German car so be punctual about your
timing.

Procedure:

1)  Engine off - key in off position.

2)  Connect both wires - grounding the test pin.

3)  Ignition switch on (run position) do not start car.

4)  After 5 seconds disconnect wires.

5)  Wait 5 more seconds.

6)  Reconnect wires, grounding test pin again.

7)  After 5 seconds disconnect wires again.

8)  Wait another 5 seconds!

9)  Turn off ignition.

Remove the test wire and try starting the car.  If all went well you should
see that air bag warning lamp extinguish in about 10 seconds (the longest
10 seconds in you life!).

If that fails, try again.  If it fails after the third attempt you will
need to use a different procedure to "READ" the fault code to find out why
the unit is faulted.  That procedure is similar, but the fault codes are
encoded and I will have to provide a chart and access procedure for you to
go further.  If you can't reset the fault lamp, drop me an E-mail and I
will try to send you the procedure and the code matrix.
