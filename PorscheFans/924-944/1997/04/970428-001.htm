Mind you: if you hit anything (no matter how slow you drive) the bumper
will break into pieces and hardly protects the rest of your car at all !
It's really nothing, cheap polyesther or something like that. I replaced my
front bumper with a US version... I'm still looking for some US bumper
mount though.

I didn't replace the rear bumper, boy are those US ones ugly !!! The front
one is not that bad, although I agree the european one does look a little
better.

But it's really true that those European ones don't protect your car at
all, absolutely nothing ! Neither front nor rear !

I once drove very slowly backwards on a dark rainy night... bang ! Who the
hell planted that tree on such a spot ?? It was a real small tiny tree,
even gave way when I hit it: I had to replace the whole rear-bumper (rubber
hardly protected the bumper !!) and the bumper-mount was bent.

In my previous 924 I have been hit from the rear twice (both while I was
standing i front of traffic lights). The first time a motor-cycle ran into
me (I think his brakes weren't working at all !): bumper simply broke into
2 pieces and the motor-cylce rammed everthing behind it. A few months after
that had been repaired: a car hit me (guy was sleeping I guess). I
completely wrecked my car. rear end was tilted up a little, right door
scratched the paint when opened or closed. It was a total-loss... I guess
it wouldn't have been that worse when there would have been US bumpers on
it. I don't think I would have even noticed the motor-cycle...

BTW: There are no foglights in the European bumpers either...
