>Okay, Okay.  There's no such thing as blinker fluid as many of you have
>already realized.  (James, did you really consult all of your technical
>references and manuals?)  April Fool's Day reminded me of an actual post
>that was made on an Air-Cooled VW newsgroup.  SOMEONE SINCERELY ASKED A
>SIMILIAR QUESTION REGARDING BLINKER FLUID!  THIS IS TRUE!  I figured I'd
>lighten things up a bit after some of the recent heated debates on NA 944's
>vs Turbo's, etc.  The original sender on the VW newsgroup received dozens of
>curious (insulting?) replies and remarks.  But I knew you guys have a sense
>of humor and wanted to see what kind of reaction I would get if I tried this
>stunt.  I posted pretty late last night, and I was surprised to have
>received a couple replies 5 minutes after posting!  You guys jumped on this
>one quick and carried it pretty far on your own too!
>        Thanks for the laughs, and let's keep all of the list members
>informed and amused.  I apologize to those of you who may think I wasted
>valuable bandwidth with this joke.  And I'll let all of you know how the
>synthetic blinker fluid works out.  Does this mean I can extend the service
>interval to 6,000 miles before changing it again? :)
