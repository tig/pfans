     Somebody here was discussing turning brake rotors. 
     
     My two cents...
     
     The concensus among the mechanics and tuners I've spoken with is 
     Don't Do It.
     
     If the rotors are worn to the point of resurfacing, then they're 
     probably under spec, too. Under spec rotors are "unsafe at any speed" 
     because they no longer have the designed in minimum cooling mass 
     needed to work. This is why some folks have reported "no brakes" after 
     having theirs turned. The rotors overheat very very quickly, and take 
     the braking coefficient with them.
     
     It is also extremely difficult to turn old rotors without cutting in 
     the "wave," or planar distortion on the braking surfaces perpendicular 
     to the rotor axis. This causes brake pedal pulse.
     
     New rotors are available at reasonable prices from a number of 
     sources, including dealers. I consider 'em cheap and valuable 
     insurance.
