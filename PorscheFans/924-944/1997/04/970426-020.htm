Hi All:

I would like to install fog or driving lights on my '88 924S.  They were
not included from the factory.  The positive (yellow-white) and ground
(brown) connectors are already wired into position near the fog light
location(s), however neither my owners manual or Haynes identifies WHERE
the fog light switch was factory mounted. Was it in the blank just below
the oil pressure gauge on the center console, or perhaps one of the four
(4) toggle switch locations just aft the shifter?  

I also see from the wiring schematic that the fog light circuit runs
through a relay and the headlight dimmer switch. I assume the relay cuts
the fog lights when the headlights are in the high-beam position. Is
this correct and if so, is there a different dimmer switch for those
cars that came equipped with fog lights which I would have to install.
Could the relay possibly already be installed in the car, and if so
where would it be located.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff Hertz
