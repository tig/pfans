Less than an hour ago I drove a new Boxster at our monthly PCA meeting.  =
My
impressions? (as if anyone cares)  Here goes:
Styling:  I have seen all the pictures, and thought the car was beautiful=
.. In
person and up close, the car is truly beautiful, and the lines, especiall=
y in
the front, are worthy of being called sexy.  I was surprised at how large=
 the
car appeared from the rear.  I did not expect it to appear so wide (not q=
uite
Corvette shock - but definitely bigger than I expected).  The body is roc=
k
solid, and the doors are much heavier and solid than I expected.  Fit and
finish was perfect.  Inside, the dash was simple and laid out well, but t=
he
steering wheel felt larger than I expected it to.  Also, I=92m 6=923=94, =
and could
never own one of these cars, as with the seat all the way back, and lower=
ed
all the way, my head was sticking up where the roof would have been had i=
t
been up.  Also, if that=92s not bad enough, my line of vision was obstruc=
ted
partially by the top of the windshield.  However, I must say that leg roo=
m
was sufficient, and the interior was comfortable.
With regard to drivability, the car seems to be a near perfect blend of o=
ld
and new.  The car feels heavy, and adequately powered, if not lightning f=
ast,
and it retains all the suspension and steering feel I expected in a new
Porsche.  Yet the shifter felt decidedly more (dare I say it) Japanese.  =
I
mean that in a complimentary way in that it was extremely smooth like but=
ter
and not at all notchy or loose in the gate.  The engine also was much qui=
eter
than I expected, and you can definitely feel the 4 valve heads start to f=
low
up around 4K or so when it really starts to breath.  As I said, power was
fine, but 30 or 50 more HP would really be nice.  As far as the brakes go=
,
they are awesome.  I had a hard time with them because they were so good.=
  I
never got into 5=92th, but kept it mostly in 3=92rd and 4=92th at about 3=
-5K, and
stopping took much much less effort than I am used to (maybe I need new
brakes on my car?).
Anyway, that=92s it.  Overall, I think it=92s priced just about perfect, =
and if I
could actually fit in the car, I might consider actually aspiring to it
someday when my kids get out of college.  Right now, I can say that it
appears to be a great car at a great price.
