Mike,

I thought you might be interested in the outcome of my water problem. I
pulled the cooler and replaced the seals, ( two of the o-rings were
slightly contorted ), flushed the engine with deisel, ( starter only ),
replaced the oil and coolant and ran a pressure check on the cooling
system. I started with 15# on a cold engine, and it held for 3 hours
with no decrease. So I started the engine and brought it up to
temperature, both oil and water, and put 15# on it again. The pressure
slowly dropped off to about 13.5# over about one hour. I figured this
was due to contraction of the coolant since the oil level never
increased ( with very frequent checks of the dipstick I might add ). So
I started it back up, brought it to temp again and put the pressure to
it a third time. This time I started with 15# (warm) and let it set
overnight. The follownig morning I checked it again and the gauge read
14# after approx. 12 hours. No leaks, no runs, no drips, no errors. I'm
reletively sure the problem has been solved. No water in the oil, no oil
in the water, no smoke from the pipe.

Thanks for your help.
