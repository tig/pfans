I'm not sure who all those people are on the To: and Cc: spots, so I'll
leave them be.

It's depressing.  The 911T can apparently only pull 1g going sideways.

I might actually suggest a smaller turbo.  It'll give you your boost
sooner and will occasionally last as long as a bigger turbo.  You won't
get as much boost, but you say that isn't as important -- and your NA 944
anecdote supports that.

I'm no expert on the 944S2 or the 944T (is that a TS, by the way?), but it
seems to me that you want *your* car, a little more fine-tuned to the sort
of driver you are.  That really, really suggests to me that you should
stick with a 951.

I think the only thing you'd really be missing out on is a little more
all-around torque (that is, before the boost kicks in) and a couple of
features that Porsche didn't come up with until the S2.

But if you decide that neither the 944S2 nor 951 is for you, well, I have
this great, dependable 924 I know you'll just *love*.  And for you, only
$2000 when you trade in your 951.
