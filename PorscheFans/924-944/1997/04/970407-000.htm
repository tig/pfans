	I know there is a sunroof repair thread out there but I can't seem 
to find anything pertaining to my problem. I have an '87 951 with a 
sunroof that changes it's mind. Last year, the sunroof would lift at 
the back like it should but it would never allow me to release the 
sunroof to take it out... even when the key was at the proper 
position. Then one day I find out that the sunroof was released. Ever 
since then I can release the sunroof. The problem is that the switch 
doesn't recognize that the sunroof is shut and releases the sunroof 
if I hold the close button too long. So basically, I can open the 
sunroof by pushing the open button, but when I push the close button, 
the mechanism goes past the "closed" position and releases the 
sunroof. So I have to try and gauge where "closed" is... Sorry for 
being so confusing. I would have emailed Chris White but his email 
address isn't posted on the archive there.
