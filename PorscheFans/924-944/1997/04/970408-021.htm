It certainly is.  However, some of the other stuff is all Porsche --
the first example that came to mind is the heater core.  Different
dimensions from the VW model, though I'm sure lots of the inner workings
are shared with VW/Audi.

In summary: generally, yes, VW/Audi parts are usually fine.  But in some
places, Porsche fiddled with the design to make it better (or, some would
argue, more expensive).

An example of where going Porsche *saves* money: a little while back, part
of the transmission needed replacing.  God only knows *what* it was (I
wasn't involved in the decision-making process at the time), but I think
(guess) part of the transaxle.  Getting the original Audi/VW part would
involve stripping down and replacing the *entire* transmission.  Very
expensive.

Fortunately, a part for the 911 fit exactly and didn't require redoing
everything.  I have *no* idea how that works, but it does, and saved
oodles of money.

YMMV.  HTH.
