My 1988 951 had $10k of damage done about 1 1/2 years ago by somebody
pulling out directly in front of me. I insisted on getting it fixed at
the local Porsche dealer and they did an excellent job. In fact,
everything about the front of the car looks better than it did prior to
the accident. I've had no mechanical problems with the car since then. I
would say if you have a dealer with a good paint and body shop, go for
it.
