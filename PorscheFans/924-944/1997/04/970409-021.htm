We will be trying out the 245/45R16 front and 265/45R16 rear combo.

This is where I'm looking for gains, past the limit.  The Hoosiers feel
great up the limit, but when they start to slide, they really move over
A LOT and don't give much confidence.  The R1's I ran a few weeks before
felt much nicer as they slid, but the Hoosiers felt like I was going to
wipe out any second.  I'd be interested to hear more of your impressions
and from the emails I've recieved this morning, there are a bunch of
others interested in the Kumho thread.
