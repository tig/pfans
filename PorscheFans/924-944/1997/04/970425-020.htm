The "switch" is located in the right hatch shock. The left shock is used for
the defogger, the right one is on chassis (ground). If the hatch is open the
cable on the right shock is connected to mass and your interior and luggage
light is switched on (they always come together). When closed the outer
cylinder moves underneath the clip with the cable, opens the connection and
the light is out.  
No switch! Only a cheap trick.....

I have a problem with the defogger on my 82 924: The power supply is not able
to power the defogger. If I the cable is plugged off the rear window it has
full Voltage, if connected to the defogger it's only 1-2 V. Seems to be a
broken cable... 
Has anyone experience with this? 

I have a heater at the back of the mirror glass. Does anyone know how to
operate it?
