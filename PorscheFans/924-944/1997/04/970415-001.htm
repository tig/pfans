Heads up on security folks.. last week at work, there were some folks
casing my car late at night.  They were circling like hawks, and not
necessarily admiring it.  The reason I was paranoid is a co-worker had her
Datsun 280-Z stolen from her driveway near our workplace a day or two
before (and it was an older, unrestored car).  I promptly called my
significant other to come out to pick up the car.  I now use a steering
wheel lock at work, and other places where I think more security is
needed.  Remove CD's and other tempting valuables from view.  A removeable
or detachable stereo is a good thing. I hope my experience will help others
to hang on to their beloved 944, or at least help prevent a broken window 
and stolen stereo.
