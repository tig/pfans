It's official, the May 97 issue, page 149. The article titled "Fatal
Attraction - I say it's the best looking car in the world." They assigned
various editors to select one vehicle whose styling, in all of automotive
history, he felt was the most beautiful. Nothing else mattered. It even
could be a one-off show car. Steven Cole Smith, Senior Editor chose the
Porsche 944!

He writes " I have to give extra points-subconsciously, anyway - to a
design that managed to be startingly attractive as well as reasonably
economical, functional, and mass produceable... the 14-year old 944 - were
it to appear brand-new in showrooms as a 1997 model - would still turn
heads... I've never owned a 944, but I could if I wanted to. And so could
you. That makes it special. "

Wow that says it all, imagine if he drove the dang thing daily like us
lucky son of a guns!
