This weekend while at Bridgehampton a friends '86 951 developed a few
interesting problems and now we seek the advice of the crowd. He has a new
clutch and just had the belts done. At 2000 RPM he has a "tinging" sound
similar to a loose heat shield or pebble in a rotor. The sound appears to
come from around the starter (new starter as well). He thinks in may be the
something with the fly wheel. Problem #2 is at 4000 RPM he has what I would
call a violent shake from the drive train. You can really feel it on the
shifter. The PO had receipts for new motor mounts, I know that at least the
right side is new, so the left one is probably is bad. Yes, I know the PO
should have done both but he did not. He will do the mount soon, but what to
do about the rest of this mess?
