Thanks to everyone for their input on the crank bolt.


There were some people that mentioned using the wrong tools for the wrong job.
 I was using a 3/8 drive breaker bar, with a 3/8 to 1/2 inch extension to the
1/2 24 mm socket 12 point socket.  I put the handle of my floor jack over the
breaker bar, and proceeded to break the knub? of the breaker bar (the knub is
still in my 3/8 to 1/2 piece).  I don't really think I was using the wrong
tools, I wasn't trying to use vice-grips or my torque wrench, however I did
break one of the tools I was using (so that could mean I was using the wrong
tools).

However I did take the opportunity to buy an 18 inch, 1/2 inch drive breaker
bar.  The previous breaker bar was only 12 inches long.  I also bought a deep
drive 12 point 24mm socket (before I was using a shallower socket, with the 3/8
to 1/2 piece, I couldn't find a 6 point socket anywhere in this small town).
 The small breaker bar was warrantied so I walked away with a new one of those
(both breaker bars and one of my many wrachets are Blackhawk brand, most of my
sockets are craftsman).

I got home, put the breaker bar on the bolt, and yanked.  I couldn't budge the
bolt so I put the jack handle on to the breaker bar.

yank
yank
yank
bang!!!  (hope this isn't suggestive)

I loosened the bolt.


Thanks for all the help!!!!
