Having just replaced the oil pan seal, I needed to hold the engine up so
I could remove the crossmember. I didn't want to buy or rent an engine lift, 
so here is what I came up with. A 2"x6" supported on the strut towers above the
engine. Two turnbuckles with steel cable looped around the engine mount arms
(the ones that attach the engine mounts to the crankcase). Tighten the
turnbuckles, and the engine lifts up! This would also be good to use if you need
to replace the engine mounts themselves. It cost me $6 in hardware, I already
had the wood. Took me about 1.5 hours to build.

Supplies:
 A) 1  2" x 6" by approx 4'
 B) 8  4" x 4" x 2" pieces of 2" x 4"
 C) 2 turnbuckles approx 6" long, with hook on one end, loop on other
 D) ~6' Plastic Coated Steel Cable, at least 3/8" dia.
 E) 4 cable clamps for above steel cable
 F) Threaded Rod or other suitable pieces of steel
 G) a bunch of 3" sheetrock screws or two 8" carriage bolts

Ok, here is an attempt at a drawing:

     ^-------------- Sits on Top of Strut Tower-------------------------^

  The stacks of 2"x4" pieces will sit on top of the strut towers,
and will be at the same angle as the top surface of the strut towers,
I just can't draw them correctly with ASCII characters. I used shims between
the 2"x6" and the top 2"x4" to obtain the correct angle. Use lots of sheetrock
screws to hold the stacks of 2"x4" together, or a carriage bolt through each
stack. You may want to add another piece of 2"x4" depending on the length of
the turnbuckls you buy. I padded the bottom of each stack of 2"x4"'s with
rubber from an old inner tube. Since I had my struts removed, I had the
whole seating surface of the strut tower for the 2"x4" stacks to sit on. You
may need to be a bit creative to obtain a nice surface to sit on if your
struts are still in the vehicle. Assemble the above.

  The turnbuckles are positioned so that they are above the engine mount 
bars where they attach to the crankcase. On the drivers side, this is easy
to see. On the passenger side, you have to look below the exhaust manifold.
Place the 2"x6" assembly from above on the vehicle. Mark the locations for
the turnbuckles. Remove from vehicle, Drill holes through the 2"x6" at these
locations. You want the holes to be big enough for the loop side turnbuckle
bolt to fit through. Using the same drill bit, make the top of these holes
more like a slot. You want the loop to recess into the 2"x6" enough for the
two pieces of threaded rod to hold it. You want the threaded rod to hold the
weight. Slot the hole enough to allow the bolt to pivot on the pieces of
rod. Cross Section:

                * *                 (0's are cross section of threaded rod)
    ...______ * 0 0 * _________...
    \\\\\\\\\ *     * \\\\\\\\\\
    \\\\\\\\\\\ * * /\\\\\\\\\\\
    \\\\\\\\\\| *  /\\\2"x6"\\\\
    \\\\\\\\\\| *  |\\\\\\\\\\\\
    ...-------+ *  +-----------...
                * <--turnbuckle bolt, loop end
                .
 Hold the threaded rods in place with sheetrock screws set in at an angle.

On the passenger side, I ran the steel cable alongside the valve
cover, inbetween the exhaust manifold pipes, and around the engine mount bar
where it attaches. On the Drivers side, you may need to move the airbox, or
associated hoses, I am not sure since I currently have them all removed. 
Cut pieces of the steel cable to the appropriate length. For each of the 4
ends of steel cable, make a loop with the cable, and hold that loop with
the cable clamps. These will go onto the hook end of the turnbuckle.

Place the whole assembly over the engine, loop the steel cables around the
engine, and hook on the turnbuckles. Rotate the turnbuckles by hand, you
be able to raise the weight of the engine without the use or a wrench.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2"x6" will flex a bit. It would be a good idea to add
                some additional strength. I take no responsibility for any
                damage or accidents resulting from using this idea. Use your
                own common sense if you decide to build this and think
                something should be done differently.

Well, it worked well for me.

Good luck! Let me know if there are any questions or comments!
