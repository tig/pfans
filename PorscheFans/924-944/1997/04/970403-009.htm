Eight months ago I purchased a 1985.5 944.  Since then I have gone 
through intensive learning, laughing, crying, and cursing and, of 
course, plenty of tender loving care to restore this vehicle to like 
new condition.  Since I had never restored a vehicle before, let alone 
a Porsche with all of its aura and mystique, you can imagine the 
reservations I had when I purchased this vehicle.  After all, it did 
have 88K miles and looked like it was ready to be sent to that "final 
highway in the sky."  The paint was faded and peeling.  Taillight 
lenses were cracked.  Sometimes the lights worked, other times they 
would not.  The tires were worn out and the wheels were faded and 
blistering.  The front spoiler was cracked along the bottom.  The 
suspension was in need of immediate attention.  Under the hood, it 
looked like a mini tornado had recently passed through.  Grease and 
dirt covered everything.  The interior was another story.  Seats and 
carpeting faded and torn.  Door panels, console and dash were in a 
serious state of abuse and neglect.  Screws were missing.  Other small 
parts and pieces had, no doubt, been cast off some time ago.  Jeez, the 
radio was even broke!  The only thing positive about this vehicle was 
the drivetrain, it was in really good condition.  There were no leaks, 
it started every time and ran well.
I am proud to say that my Porsche has undergone a complete 
transformation.  The interior is like new, the paint job is flawless, 
the suspension works like it was designed and the engine compartment 
glistens and shines.  I know  I can look forward to years of worryfree 
driving pleasure.  I just wish I could get the car away from my wife so 
I can enjoy it as much as she does. 
Some of the upgrades I made are: Koni shocks and struts, throttle 
response cam, splitfire plugs, K&N filter and hotwires.
I have one area of concern.  The rear hatch glass was separated from 
the frame in the top left corner.  I could find no one to repair the 
original glass so I purchased another rear hatch.  This hatch is 
beginning to do the same thing.  Is there anything I can do about this 
problem?  I have measured the hatch from all sides to ensure the hatch 
is completely aligned and square. 

Thanks in advance 

Russ McMullen Jr.
