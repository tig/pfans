I don't really know much about our cooling systems and their inherent flaws,
but I do know that it's okay for coolant to expand when hot.  Your coolant
exists in a closed environment, and its volume (and thus, pressure) has to
increase with any increase in heat (energy).  After spirited runs in your
car, you should expect your coolant to be at a higher level than before, and
it may indeed pass the max mark depending on how much coolant was in the
system when cold.  I have heard from other 944 owners that one should
maintain the coolant between the min/max indicator lines, and to avoid
topping up near the max-line because you can have the coolant "overflow" if
you run the engine warm enough for a long enough period of time (and you
have a weak filler cap gasket).  While it's not that big a deal to spill a
little, coolant is pretty lethal on your paint and I imagine it's not
exactly great on other stuff (belts, etc.).
        I have heard of problems with filler cap gaskets- I guess after they
get old, they can allow the coolant to escape when the coolant system is
trying to equalize its pressure with that of the atmosphere.
        Hopefully, your car should be okay.  I'm wondering what other (more
knowledgeable) listmembers may have to say about this.  I hope I'm not
giving you a false sense of security when I'm supposed to be warning you
about explosive pumps!  Good luck!
