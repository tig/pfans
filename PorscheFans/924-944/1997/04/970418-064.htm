Barry,

You are exactly right.  The low production numbers for the Turbo S make for
great difficulties in predicting a real market value.  There have been
large price differences for these cars as witnessed by the low purchase
price of my 89 Turbo ($10,500 which I have put about $1700 into it to get
it up to spec), and the much higher (>$20,000) prices for excellent
examples with low mileage.

In the end it is all what the market will bear.  For some people the asking
price is too high.  For others it is not an issue.

As for the 968, it is true that it is a well engineered example of what
Porsche can do.  Porsche has extended the 944 into a very potent, yet
civil, sports car with evolutionary changes.  The Turbo and the 968 are
really quite different cars.  While it is true a 968 will give the stock
Turbo a run for its money, the Turbo has much greater potential for
additional horse power modifications than can be accomplished (dollar per
dollar) with any normally aspirated 924/944/968.  However, the 968 has much
more lower end torque and so behaves much better in tight places.  They are
just two different machines.  Which is better for you is a matter of
personal preference and what you intend to do with them.
