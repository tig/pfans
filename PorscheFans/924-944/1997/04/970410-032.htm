Please help!!!

I have a 78 924 with over 200,000 on it. I am having ignition problems. I
have replaced distributor, coil, cap, rotor, wires. I have checked all cold
start parts and ignition "Brain" box also fuel system. All seams to be
fine.

Now what it is doing is it will run for about 30 sec to 1 min and die. Like
someone shut it off. I hooked up a timing light to coil wire and watch as I
cranked engine over and noticed erratic spark, very erratic and sometimes
none. I'm lost. The only thing I can think it could be is balast risistor?
Ignition relay? Is there one? I have also replaced Ign. switch. Wiring
short? Where? Any help would be GREAT!

Thanks in advance

I'm going to miss her.
