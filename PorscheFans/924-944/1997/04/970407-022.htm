I don't think so.  Seems to me that the 924 is comparable to a NA 944 in
terms of maintenance.  Although I've seen conflicting information on when
to change the oil (1K miles, 3K miles, manual says 6K miles, 9K miles...
yeah, right), it mostly seems about the same.

Well, the '79s have 110 hp, so I doubt it.  I think that number is
actually 95 hp.  Euros are different, they stayed in the 120 range the
whole time they were made.

If you have to save money, you can sometimes get VW or Audi parts instead
of Porsche ones.  Can't vouch for their reliability, though -- my mechanic
and I both agree that Porsche is really the way to go if you can afford
it.
