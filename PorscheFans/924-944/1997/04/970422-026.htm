Here is some info on fixing what seems to be the most common cruise
control problem with 944's, from my own experience with my '86 with 230K
miles.. This info generally applies to '85.5 and newer 944's. I believe
pre '85.5 vehicles used the same servo, but different control
electronics which used RPM's instead of vehicle speed as a feedback
parameter.

Symptoms:
     o Cruise Control works intermittently
     o Surging
     o Full or partial throttle acceleration above pre set speed

Component identification:
     o The Cruise Control Electronics are located under the dash on the 
       left side of the vehicle behind and above the hood release lever.
     o The Cruise Control Servo is located in the Engine compartment in 
       front of the Battery.

  The Cruise Control electronics compare vehicle speed to set speed, and
adjust servo position accordingly. I am not sure if a Proportional
Integral Derivative (PID) controller is used, or some other combination
thereof. It really isn't too important for our purposes. The important
thing to understand is how the servo needs to operate for correct cruise
control functionality. The controller needs to set the position of the
servo (which in turn moves the gas pedal, and throttle). Since the servo
uses a DC motor, which produces a force somewhat proportional to the
current supplied to it, an additional positional feedback loop is
required. A variable resistor is used in this case, which is attached to
a shaft inside the servo. If this variable resistor fails due to
contamination, oxidization, etc, this feedback loop is broken, and the
cruise control electronics can not position the servo correctly, causing
surging and/or related symptoms. In my case, I was able to disassemble
the servo, and clean the variable resistor parts to restore operation of
this feedback loop, and therefor my cruise control. If you are
experiencing similar cruise control problems, this may be worth trying.

You will need:
    o Goggles
    o phillips
    o assorted sockets,wrenches (10mm,12mm?)
    o Spray on contact cleaner (Radio Shack, local electronics supply,
or 
      mail order) look for something that also contains a protectant to
      minimize future oxidization. This is typically some sort of
mineral oil. 

o Remove cable from servo. It is a small ball joint which is held on by
a metal clip. The metal clip has to be slid off to remove the cable.

o Remove the Electrical Connector from its housing/mount, and
disconnect.

o Take note as to how the servo and related brackets are attached,
unbolt, and remove from vehicle. Be careful not to loose any parts. The
metal spacers inside the rubber grommets fall out easily. 

o Mark the relationship of the lever on the servo shaft (the one you
just disconnected the cable from), and take note as to which side the
spring returns it to. If the shaft doesn't feel like it has a spring
attached to it, this is another big problem with your servo. Remove the
bolt holding this lever on by holding the lever with a pair of pliers.

o Use a high quality phillips head screwdriver to remove the cover. Be
careful, the spring may come flying out. You may need to gently tap the
sides of the case to open it. Observe how things are assembled. The
variable resistor consists of two carbon traces on the PCB board, and a
wiper attached to the internal shaft. You will notice that the internal
shaft is not directly attached to the shaft which exits the case. It is
connected in such a way as to only allow the servo to pull on the cable
in a manner as to increase throttle. You will also note that you can not
rotate the internal shaft by rotating the external shaft while the unit
is assembled. This is why we couldn't test for correct variable resistor
operation while the unit is assembled. Inspect the carbon traces. They
should not look burnt, or otherwise damaged. Mine had some grease on it.
Use spray on contact cleaner to clean the carbon traces, and the wiper
on the inner shaft. Make sure you hold the servo so that the liquid
(cleaner and dirt) can run out of the case. Insert the inner shaft and
check for adequate wiper pressure. If the wiper has deflected over time,
you may want to bend it a bit to restore contact pressure with the
traces. You don't want too much pressure or it will wear out
pre-maturely. Now would be a good time to check  operation with an ohm
meter. Connect to the wiper, and the end of one of the traces. Check for
smooth readings as you rotate the shaft (must be perpendicular to the
PCB). I believe the resistance should vary from several Kohms to close
to Zero. Check both traces. Once you are certain the traces are clean
enough, re-assemble. I re-greased appropriate areas, just make sure you
don't get any on the variable resistor contact surfaces. Once the cover
is back on, check that the shaft returns to its original
counter-clockwise position via operation of the internal spring. If so,
re-assemble, and re-install in your vehicle. Now take it out on the
highway and see if it works!  

  The above shouldn't take more than about an hour to do.

Let me know if there are any comments or questions on the above. I am
just going from memory. Maybe we could improve on the above, and make an
addition to the FAQ once it is refined enough.  

Good Luck!
