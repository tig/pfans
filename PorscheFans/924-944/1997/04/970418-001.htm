Qassim, for about the same price you can get Boge shocks for all four 
wheels. I don't have anything against Monroes but if you're going to go to 
the trouble of putting the car up on jackstands and pulling the wheels you 
might as well do all four. There are a couple of folks who are on this list 
who sell Porsche parts and they might give you a better deal. I don't use 
my '83 944 for anything other than a daily commute and I put Boges in it 
from Tweeks. Fine shocks for driving around town, but I could have spent a 
little less and gotten the same or better if I'd thought to shop around a 
little. 

Don't forget after you do the shocks you're going to need an alignment, and 
that will cost about $100 or so... so cheap shocks aren't as cheap as they 
sound!

Pete
