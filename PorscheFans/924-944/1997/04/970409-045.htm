Hi,
First time writer so please bear with me.
I have an 1986 not turbo 944 excellent condition 73k.
The only problem I seem to have with the car are minor
glitches with interior electrical system such as:
a sticking speedometer (guessing electrical)
a horn that will not sound unless the engine is running
a mpg gauge that seems to stick
a dome light that not always lites (yes I did check the door switches)
Not the end of the world, but I am very proud of my
car and I don't mind fixing it.
Is there a ground wire that could be playing german
mind games with me?  I have seen other articles about the
sticking gauges, but the horn problem really has me guessing.
I checked the Haynes manual but things seem to look right.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you 
Nine4four@aol.com
