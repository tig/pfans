While I am a firm believer in turbochargers and would never own a 
supercharged or NA car in my life (I've owned four turbo cars now), I
do want to ensure that people are able to make a good decision based
on facts.  Anthony above talks about parasitic drag from the pulley and
belt setup and he is absolutely correct, but a turbocharger also 
creates a power loss situation in that the turbocharger's turbine housing
and turbine wheel pose a restriction to the exhaust flow, thus reducing
horsepower.  The exact figures, I don't know, probably less than what you
get with a supercharger belt/pulley, but there is still some loss there.

As to the drag racer that mentioned that Superchargers are the best way
to make the most power.  I don't know if I agree with you.  From what I've
read (I've never built a 2000hp turbocharged motor :]), the reason why
drag racers don't use turbocharged motors is because the rules do not
allow them to.  Is this a correct assumption?  Or is it because turbochargers
are more difficult to launch?  The fastest I've ever gone at a track is 12.7
@ 107mph, so I'm not well versed in 200mph+ runs at the 1/4 mile :)

The reason why I make that assumption above is that many of the very
fastest race cars in the world rely on turbocharging to yank every last
HP they can get out of a motor, except in drag racing (Buick GN's aside).
