Count me in on the interest in this item. Also, I'm looking for a decent
rear valance for my '86 944. I don't particularly like the cheap-looking
vented unit available from Automotion and Performance Improvements....does
anyone know of another unit that looks a little more Porsche-like, and yet
doesn't act like an air-scoop under the car?

Regards,

Ross Leonard
'86 NA 944
