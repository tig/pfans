A few questions:

Tire advice: I currently have snow tires on my 87 S. I intend to get tires
before May. I use the car every day (around 40 miles) and I also intend to take
the car to drivers ed. I have been recommended Yokohama A008Ps any comments?

This may be a stupid question but what exactly is the rev limiter supposed to
do? My engine cuts out (dies) when I hit the red (it goes again once the revs
die down). Is this normal or does the limiter limit the revs by holding them at
that point?

My car doesn't like the new warm (maybe damp) weather! During the winter it has
been fine. Now that it became warmer (well it appeared to be) the engine has
started to stall when stopping or even during a really slow gear change (Must
stop listening to the Jazz station).

I also have noticed that when my engine is cold that I have significant engine
noise on AM. This goes away once the engine is hot.

Thank you.
