Hi Dave and All,

My problem is just the opposite.  When cold, the valve train is nice and quiet with the 
usual injector click in the background.  After warming up, however, there's a very loud 
clacking coming from the valve cover.  It's so loud that you can hear it inside the car 
with the hood closed and the window down.  The car seems to run well otherwise, but I'm 
sure this isn't normal and should be attended to ASAP.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
