When I was in the market for an IBM a bunch of years ago (when a 286 was
new!), I went to a local place, called ComputerLand or something.  I
looked around at the stuff, but since I didn't know crap about computers
at the time, I really needed the aid of a salesperson.  I looked all over
and couldn't find one, so finally went to the desk and asked for help.

The lady there asked me what company I represented.  I told her I
represented myself, and sometimes not that.  She glared at me, frowned,
and said, in a very snobbish voice, "OH.  Well, we don't deal with
*individuals.*  You'll have to go to a *discount* store to get something
*you* can afford, anyway."

I went home, incredibly pissed.  I needed to vent, so I called up IBM's
customer service and told them how I was treated.  Ten minutes later, I
got a call from ComputerLand, *begging* me to go back and buy a computer.
The manager got on the phone to apologize personally about thirty times
and offerred me something ridiclous like a 25% discount.

I later learned that IBM had threatened to withdraw CL's status as an
official IBM dealer and recall all their machines unless they sucked up to
me, big-time.

The moral of the story: Yes, definitely call PCNA or the owner of the
dealership.  I can't say that the same thing will happen for you, but the
chances aren't too bad.

				conversation, n.: a vocal competition
     icarus@berkshire.net	in  which the one who is catching his
				breath  is   called   the   listener.
