Hi !

I've been walking around with the idea of building an LPG installion into
my 1988 924S (944) and am wandering wether someone has some experience with
this ? I don't think it should be really difficult...

While looking at all possible obstacles I learned a lot about the engine
and how it works (with motronics etc)... I see that the injection nozzles
are very simple: just two wires that can open a little valve letting
through the fuel from the tube above... Now I was thinking: a car my dad
used to have a few years back had a "special" feature that closed the
fuel-tubes to the cilinders when you released the gas-pedal (when driving
at speed, with the clutch released) so that the engine didn't use any fuel
when slowing down for a traffic-light. It should be very simple to build a
similar system into a 944: simply cut the wires to the injection nozzles
(and the ignition probably) as soon as the gas-pedal is released...

But then I was thinking: since this is a so simple trick, is it already
built into the motronic system ? Or is it impossible for some reason ?

FYI: Fuel prices are huge over here in Holland ! They ought to invent
engines that run on bars of gold: that would be cheap for us !!!
