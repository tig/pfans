I Know I've seen several references to this problem in the past, but I
don't have a clue where to look for them. I just joined the elite group
of 944 owners with water in my oil, and it doesn't feel good! 

I suspect it is an oil cooler seal leak because I haven't had any of the
symptoms of head gasket problems up till now, (except MAYBE a rough idle
when the car is cold), and I've seen several FAQ's about the 944's
propensity to develop leaks at the oil cooler.

My question is this; can I remove the oil cooler and repair the leaks
without removing the engine, and/or is it just easier to jerk it out to
address this problem? I caught it VERY quickly, and I don't think that
there is any ancilliary damage to the bearings, etc., so I'm hesitant to
go too far. 

Gosh, I love these cars!
