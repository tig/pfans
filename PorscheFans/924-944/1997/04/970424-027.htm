I was wondering (obsessing) if I could ask (again) peoples honest opinion
of the 944 S2 vs the Turbo as a track car.  I've just started doing
driver ed. track events this year, and I have a Turbo.  I know that Turbo
is a more popular car in the club, but I also know that the S2 does show
up.  I want to remain in the stock class, and I feel that for the kind of
driver that I am (or think I am) I would enjoy the "low end" of the S2
more than the "high end" of the Turbo.  As far as modifications - I know
that a lot can be done with the Turbo, where as the S2, not much, but
considering that I want to remain stock (for at least a few years), I
think the S2 would be a better car.  I think that I would like to avoid
Turbo related issues for now (turbo lag, keeping boost up,etc.)

What do you guys think???
