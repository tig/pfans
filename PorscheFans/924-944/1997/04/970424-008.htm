Hi to all You Porsche Fans out there!

Greetings from Finland, the new homeland for famous Boxster.
I live quite near (about 30 ml) to the Uusikaupunki factory where they used to 
manufacture Saabs, Opel Calibras, Russian Ladas and in autumn -97 
Porsche Boxster! Imagine Lada and Boxster from the same factory.

Ok, I have been following this list for couple of months, which I 
have had my -82 924. I am not quite sure about my cars mileage, but 
it has 18000 km on the odometer, and judging from the car (pedals, 
interior, brakes and overall appearance) I'd like to think it has been 
driven 118 000 km and maximum 218 000 km. 

However, when I had my valves adjusted for the autoslalom I found out 
that my camshaft had two worn "noses", and needs then replacing.

After checking out the prices (about 80 $ each) of the adjustable valve lifters.
 I have a question:

Should all of these followers be automatically replaced together with 
a new (or reground) cam?

What else should I do besides axial oil seal (stefa), new oil pipe. 
broken lifters, cam and cover seals. Oil seals of the valves, maybe?

Since I use the car for slalomand maybe some club track events I 
would like to know is anywhere available special sport cams for my 
car, or maybe some Audi motor. Which Audi (year and the model had the 
same motor or head than Porsche 924 -82?

Thank You in advance.
