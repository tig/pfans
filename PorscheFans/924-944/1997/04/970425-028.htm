Hi Sam;
Sam is still debating about which car would be better for him at the track.
In my opinion you are better off with the Turbo for the track and an S2 for
everyday driving.  I may change my opinion if the S2 has the M030 suspension
and your Turbo does not.  All else being stock, the few horsepower
difference between the non-S, non-chipped Turbo and the N/A S2 is no big
deal.  Suspension will matter here more than the horsepower difference.  The
S2 will be easier to drive, but I think you will be better off in the long
run by learning to drive the Turbo correctly.

I would estimate that it took me a good year to properly learn how to drive
my '89 Turbo half decently.  I still learn something new everytime I do
Driver's Ed or Autocross and I am now starting my third year with the car.
My first season of autocross I finshed dead last in the local PCA autocross
series.  Last year I finished third overall in class going against S2s and
968s.  This year, if I stick with it, I expect to finish first in my class
except if Terry Baker shows up, then second is looking pretty nice.  Why
dump the Turbo for an S2 that you will have figures out in a year.  After
figuring out the S2 are you going to then go out and get another Turbo?
