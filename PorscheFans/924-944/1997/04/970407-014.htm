Whoa Matt!  I see you're a Mechanical Engineer and a Macintosh Believer. 
I won't hold that against you as long as you don't try to be an Atmospheric
Chemist too.  I am one, by training and by trade, and I do not know a single
"top scientist" that doubts that R-12 is leading to the degradation of
stratospheric ozone.  There are some scientists, mostly in the employ of
industry interests, who remind us constantly that there are other ozone
destroyers out there and that banning R-12 might not solve the whole problem.
Still, if the doctor says I've got cancer, I'm gonna quit smoking even if the
drinking may eventually get me.

As far as the bureaucrat looking for a crusade, they're mostly just looking 
for a paycheck these days.  The money for crusades was all spent in the '80s.

p.s.  I hope the FR-12 works, with or without the $200 fittings.
