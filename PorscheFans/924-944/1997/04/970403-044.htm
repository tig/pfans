I personally dislike bras in any form.  They do not allow the paint to
properly breathe, and most owners don't remove them regularly enough to
prevent dirt and grime from collecting between the paint and the lining.
Bra linings also make excellent sponges that may take days to dry.
Accelerated corrosion can also result if some road salt has also become
mixed with that moisture.


        If you do choose to use any bra, be sure to take it off and clean it
often, and don't leave it on for weeks at a time.  It's a good habit to take
it off weekly and let everything air out on the weekends.  Also pull the bra
tight across the car or mirror.  If its loose, it will flap in the wind at
high speeds, scratching your finish like sand paper.  The longer you use it,
the greater the color will differ between covered and uncovered portions of
the car (UV fading).  While the mirror may become a target for rock chips,
you have to weigh protecting it against having it's paint not match the rest
of the car when it is off.  Unless, of course, you only plan on using the
mirror bras on long highway trips and leave it off on other occasions.
