As the owner of a 1980 924 Turbo for the last 10 of its years, I can attest that my 
intake duct has always had a trace of oil in it, even right after a turbo rebuild.
However, this oiling gradually becomes heavier as time goes on and smokey start-ups
are soon to follow.  I got about two years of smoke-free start-ups after my first turbo
rebuild using the car as a daily driver.  My latest turbo work is not yet a year old 
and I only take the car out on special occasions (like weekends), but the smoke at 
start-up is becoming evident again.  It only lasts a short time.  The first good 
acceleration seems to purge the oil through the system.  At idle, she'll smoke for a 
couple of minutes.  I've taken to the habit of backing out of the garage directly!  
Bottom line:  These KKK turbo rebuilds don't last very long.

I'm not sure which model was used in the 931s, but rebuild kits have always been priced 
at about $200.  I think I saw one for $179.  They come with two sleeve bearings and their
keeper rings, two oil-control rings for the exhaust side of the shaft, various washers 
and spacers for the shaft, and what looks like an oil splash shield and slinger that's
supposed to keep the oil out of the intake side of the turbo (but doesn't for very long).
There's also a lot of extraneous nuts, washers and seals that are used to put the 
housings onto the center part, but none of these seemed to be in need of replacement on
my turbo.  In general, it looks like about $20 worth of hardware all sealed up in
shrink wrap with a $200 price tag on it.  Of course, a rebuilt turbo is about 5 times
the price, so I can't fault the parts seller's for their pricing.  Rebuilds help, but I 
think the shaft is wearing also and the new sealing rings don't help for long.

But first, Chris' problem with smoke under acceleration (after everything is warmed up?)
is not like the smoke problem I've had.  The turbo may not be your problem Chris.  The
valve seals may be.  Mine had also gone the way of all things Earthly by about 80k miles.
I had slight smoke almost all the time.  The piston rings were fine so I had the head
reworked and all was well, for a while.  It's that darned turbo, you know.

I would say that the difficulty of a turbo rebuild is not that great, but you have to 
know what to do; like marking the position of the aluminum compressor blade on the shaft
before disassembly so that you get it back on in the same position when you're done to 
preserve the dynamic balance.  Apparently, even the light-weight aluminum blades can have
an effect.  Finally, installation of the rebuilt turbo is like trying to get a cat into
a bathtub.  I can send a written account of my experiences and lessons learned if anyone 
so desires.

Sorry to be so wordy, but this is a subject that I bet many Porsche Turbo owners have
anguished about over the years.  I hear Callaway has a solution, but it requires an
incestuous mixture of Porsche and non-Porsche parts that I have hoped to avoid.
