John -- I've got an '89 S2 and think it's a great car for both road and
track.  Go for it.

>1.  is ABS standard?

Yes.

>2.  what is the 0-60 time?  6.0 seconds or 6.9 seconds?

Both. It depends on who tested the car.   6.0 seconds is probably closer to
its capabilities, but I wouldn't recommend dropping the clutch too often to
find out. There are better things to do with an S2, like time your 0-100
mph runs, and you don't have to get mean with the clutch to do this in
15-16 sec.  S2s are for high-speed cruising and playing in the curves, not
drag racing.

>3.  does chipping the car help its acceleration?

I doubt it. After chipping my late '85 944, I don't think it's worth
chipping most normally aspirated car. Some S2 owners I know who did chip
their cars didn't see much change.  Anyway, S2s are so stable and relaxed
that I doubt even another 15-20 hp would be noticed.  Personally, I've
decided to just keep mine as well serviced as possible and forget about any
modifications.  I'd suggest that if the S2 you're looking at is in good
shape, base your buying decision on the power it has now, and don't think
that you can make it go much faster without spending a lot a bucks. I've
checked with several Porsche speed shops on this topic, and their usual
response was "save your money". 

Hope this helps.
