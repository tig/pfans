Absolutely. Have not found a good way to do this. Fortunately, haven't had
to do it more than once. That was enough! Finally took out the valve stem
and piled weights on the tire (from a weight bench) to get it into shape.
Turned it every 24 hours to refold a new section. Took about a week to get
right.

But if you ever want to get rid of your frustrations, it's a great way to
go heaving around heavy stuff and sorta beating it up.
