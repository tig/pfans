Just a couple of technical questions about a Porsche I'm considering buying. I've

experience with British @ Italian sports cars and VW's, but this is my first Porsche.

Please reply directly, as I am not currently subscribed to the list (but hopefully

that'll change :). The car in question is a '77 1/2 924 automatic from Cal., 105 kmi

Any recommendations on how to determine the size of the engine? I understand these

were available with either a 1.6 or 1.8 liter engine.

The transmission has some leakage; any known/serious problems here?

The frame on the hatch glass has been bent somewhat, preventing the hatch from

closing perfectly (though it does latch). In the event that I can't straighten this

out, are replacements reasonably available?

Any other things in general to watch out for, etc.? The car has been very well

maintained, starts well and has good oil pressure.

Thanks in advance...
