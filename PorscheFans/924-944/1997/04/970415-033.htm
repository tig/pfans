Hi Mark,

> I am looking at replacing the rotors on my '89 951.  Can anyone speak to
> the pros and cons of cross drilled or slotted rotors?

PRO for Cross Drilling 
-Better cooling than slotted or standard
-lighter weight

CON for cross drilling
-The rotor WILL crack. It's just a matter of time.
-If the holes are not done in the proper pattern, the holes will
cause uneven pad wear.

PRO for slotting
-slot serves to clean the pad each time the slot crosses the pad. Much
like a windshield wiper on a windshield
-slot allows expanding brake pad gas to dissipate

Con for slotting
None that I can think of. Maybe weight - a little heavier than drilled.
More expensive than standard rotors.

Standard (no slotting or drilling)
PRO
price - cheaper than drilling or slottign
wear - if not overheated will last longer than drilled / slotted

Con
heat - easier to overheat
can get some pad material transferred to rotor

> Also, what is the consensus on Pagid brake pads for street use?

Which Pagid pads are we talking about? The street pads are excellent for
street use. I don't know about the race pads, but I would not think they
are suitable (most race pads require a fairly high temp before they work
well, good street pads NEED to work well cold)

One minor point - the holes you see in new Porsche rotors (like on the
C4 S for example) are not drilled, but are cast into the rotor. Drilling
a rotor creates many stress risers. That will cause the rotor to crack
pretty quickly. That's OK if you're a racer with a big budget and can
afford to throw rotors away after each race. The cast rotors will last 
longer, but will still crack.

NOTE - almost all this "info" is from Carrol Smith in his "Tune / Engineer 
/ Drive to Win" series of books (that's 3 books, not 1).
