I don't know why the fuel would be drawn from above instead of below the
engine, but could it have something to do with the different tank and its
respective size and space constraints?  I do know that when Porsche
intoduced the first 944 turbo in 1985.5, it had a larger, molded plastic
fuel tank instead of the (I assume) metal(?) one used in NA 944's.  Perhaps
the newer tank placed limitations on routing of fuel lines because of its
design?
        By the way, did Porsche eventually give the rest of the 944 line-up
the larger, plastic gas tank (S2's or later model NA's)?
