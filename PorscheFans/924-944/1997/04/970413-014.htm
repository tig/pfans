"An odd thing just happened.  I was on my way to lunch, got in my car 
(which is always left parked in reverse), put the clutch to the floor, 
and started.  I backed out of the space and, then, when I went to shift, 
the stick wouldn't budge.  I immediately noticed that, even with the 
clutch fully depressed, the car would pull backwards if I eased off the 
brakes at all.  WHAT is THIS?? :( "

You transmission is not (was not) fully disengaging from the engine.  Two
things I'd check would be pilot bearing (is the input shaft sticking or
binding) , and the other is whether the clutch disc is sliding freely on the
input shaft.  I suppose a third possibility is in the hydraulics, and maybe
the clutch isn't fully disengaging.  You'd notice that, however, with a low
pedal (which may "pump up" after a few shifts)
