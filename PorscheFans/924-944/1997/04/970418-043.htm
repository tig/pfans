As far as I know, synthetic oil does not change significantly with age.  (I
guess natural oil doesn't "age" much either since it's been sitting under
the earth's crust for millions of years anyway!)  Its chemical properties
should remain effective as long as the oil was stored in a reasonable
environment (like not sitting next to a blast furnace for 6 years).  The
reason you have to change your car's oil is not because it's getting "old,"
but rather because dirt, metal, and other crap becomes suspended in it,
reducing the oil's ability to lubricate and protect the engine properly.
The oil itself should be as good as when you put in in 3,000 miles earlier.
If you don't change your oil regularly, you'll have some high-quality,
refined, liquid sandpaper flowing in your engine.
        If you're really worried, just buy another case for the Porsche and
use the old stuff in your other car or lawn mower.  I guess $20 for a case
of oil and insurance is a lot cheaper than $2,000 in engine damage.

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
