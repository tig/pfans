Hello all,   being a Porsche non-self-maintenance type (which I *know* leads to 
making ownership just that more expensive) I've always enjoyed this list in 
that it helps me to make sure the shop i deal with isn't giving me a bum steer. 
That said....

My latest problem is that the fan doesn't seem to be coming on early enough in 
the early heatup stages.....what happens is the temp gauge reads fine (right 
around 1 bar) while travelling around, but once I encounter stop-n-go traffic, 
the temp can climb to nearly red zone. (read:  between top bar and red line but 
never reaching redline).  then the fan will kick on long enough to cool it to 
what I believe is the proper place (nearly back to 1 bar).  Then it starts over 
again.  heat up....nearly redline...fan comes on...cool down.  We've had 
relatively cool temps (50's/60s/low70s) here in Richmond, Va but I'm worried 
that once summer hits with it's 95+ degree weather that this may get worse and 
worse.  

I've got a stock '86 944 - 4 cyl....any advice on what to have them look at 
first and maybe what pitfalls to avoid???  

thanks!
