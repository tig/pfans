I second that. As I mentioned before, I was looking at both 951S and 968
models. The 968s range from $21k ('92 model, fair condition) to $31k ('95,
excellent condition). This is for coupes -- cabriolets are considerably
more expensive.

The 968 is probably a better car for street driving because of its low-end
torque, but Barry is absolutely right that the 951S is faster on the track.
968s are excellent handling cars and have nice power (and a great torque
curve), but they just aren't as competitive as the 951S, which is a
911-killer.

M030 968s are *extremely* rare. The option package wasn't actually
available until '93 or '94, even though it was on the books for '92.

Of course, some people don't care about performance on the track. They're
both Porsches, which means they're the greatest cars on earth. Which car
you want/need depends on your personality and how you like to drive.
