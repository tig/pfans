Ben,

In response to the question of correct ride height (front & rear) for the
water cooled Porsches (Boxster aside), the rake of the North American
924/944/968 was set with the tail slightly higher than the nose.  This was
done to meet U.S. bumper law requirements.  Porsche had intended to (and I
think the Euro cars are) set the nose and tail to the same ride height.
Setting your car to that specification maximizes the braking by reducing
nose dive.

The rake was intended to be set so the lower edge of the rocker panel was
parallel with the floor of a level garage.

The tail rake can be set with some eccentric bolts just in front of the
rear wheel axles.

The front height is not adjustable unless you have the M030 suspension with
the ride height adjustable Koni shocks (about $460 each!).

There was an article in Excellence (924/944/968 General Suspension
Preparation, May, 1984, pp. 100, issue #45), by Jim Pasha.  In that article
Pasha explores the front and rear suspensions of all three cars in depth.
He further describes how to set the car up for varying degrees of
performances.  It is well worth buying the back issue from Ross publishing
(415 382-0580) for the $5.00 cost.
