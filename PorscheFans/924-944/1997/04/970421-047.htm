ARCHIVES:

I have trouble getting into the PorscheFans archive... I set dates and
select 924-944, but then the browser just spins forever... is it searchable
any other way?

I tried to search the archives, I know wheel bearings have been covered, but...

FRONT WHEEL BEARINGS:

after replacing the front rotors/pads and repacking the front wheel
bearing, I tightened the wheel bearing so that the inner washer "just
barely moves" with light finger pressure on a screwdriver... now that I've
done it, it seems a mighty vague way to describe this level of tightness...
mine is actually just a slight slight bit tighter than "just barely moves"
with finger pressure, but it still moves easily...

I know they both must suck, but is too tight better than too loose? I feel
that mine is as "loose" as it should be, though I feel that it is a tick
too tight going by the above description... it rolls fine, it sounds better
than before, it drives smooth and quietly, but what are the consequences
should I have screwed this up? should I take it apart after a few days and
see if anything has moved?

also, I've never packed bearings before... I cleaned everything with
acetone, let everything dry, and then literally "packed" grease into the
bearings using  a pinching motion with my fingers (kinda fun actually)... I
then greased the whole spindle, using less near where the inner seal is
seated and keeping it off the threads... I used a fair amount inside the
hub and on the outside of the spindle, but a not a whole bunch... the
manual said to use ~60 grams... I used about 4-5 heaping teaspsoons...

as usual, thanks... we're getting there, I owe the list a lot...
