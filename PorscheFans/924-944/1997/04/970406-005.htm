I just tried my first autocross. It was a practice session on the course
Farzaan talked about last week. What a hoot! I was the only P-car there and
didn't give a great showing as I was on street tires and a total novice.
There was only four cars so we got a lot of runs. I was about 3 seconds
behind a Mustang with R1's and the owner driving and about 1 second behind
with another driver. I was 3 seconds ahead of a Mazda on street tires. The
other car (a dune buggy) threw a rod on his first practice so never got a
good time but he looked very fast. One of the guys tried my car and beat me
by a couple of seconds so I've got room for improvement. I learned a lot 
riding with him. Next time Porsche will win!
