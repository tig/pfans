Dear Listmembers;

Michael has brought up a topic to which I too have a dilemma. It's that time
of the year, and I thought I'd toss a little more 93 octane on that fire.

Have 86' na 944, 59k. Had A/C checked when purchased in 1993. Lost pressure by
next summer and "reboosted". Did same following season. Lost pressure over
time again and have not tested yet this year.  Like Michael, am weighing
purging, testing, replacing, filling process and comparing it to price of R-12
which is escalating as we are reading this.  Mechanic has looked into
alternative R-12 "compatible" sources but each requires a dedicated servicing
and filling nipple which means once you go there you can't come back.  Gotta
have the A/C for summer so I'l bite the bullet and throw money at it. But....
oAre there any typ. A/C parts that are prone to failure first (I know that the
pressure test should make that apparent) but just thought I'd ask?
oAt last summer's PCA event, I could not get the factory rep to comment on
R-134a conversion for 944 or like models.  Any word from those on the list? 
How about any less expensive R-12 replacements? (Read on list Pennzoil has
one?)
oIf it requires that I shop for replacement parts, is "used" a viable
alternative?

In a side note I have a turn-signal stalk that will not reset itself when
turning right.  Need to remove 4-spoked steering wheel to examine pins and
cancel allignment on "patient".  What size socket would that require for the
hub nut?

If you could find it in your heart, please cc: me personally as well as to the
list for I too have been digest-impaired lately.( but not the last few days)
TIA for everyone's assistance.
