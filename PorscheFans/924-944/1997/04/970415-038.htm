Hi all...

I am rebuilding a '82 924T.  The PO went through two turbos and two 
sets of pistons, all before 80K miles.  Part of his problem was a 
LOUSY mechanic (cut lots of corners-like nylock nuts on the exhaust), 
as well as running 1 bar boost with no knock sensor or intercooler.

1) If you're not familiar with 931's, the ignition on the 81 and 82 turbo 
is electronic-like the 944's to 85.5, I beleive.  I am missing the 
flywheel position sensor for this car, and I'm sure that would 
compromise the ignition timing and help blow the car up again.  I was 
wondering if anyone knew if this sensor is part of a harness or not, 
and if anyone knew where I could get one.

2) The valve faces were spotted(burned) slightly when I took them out.  
after cleaning everything, I lapped them back in with some medium 
compound.  The margins are thick enough, but the valve seats are a 
little wide.  What will happen if the seats are too wide? Also, can 
turbo exhaust valves be recut? will they burn more easily?  At $50 a 
piece, I'm trying to avoid buying them.  Are there any good 
aftermarket valve suppliers?

TIA

Dave
