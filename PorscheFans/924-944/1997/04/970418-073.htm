My previous car was really bad at this.  The ABS would kick in over
every small bump.  Perhaps the cars with seriously stiff suspensions
like the Bilstein turbo cup setup would also experience this?

And I'd like to apoligize for being quite harsh.  After sending the email,
I read Doug's reply and that really was enough, but I had already sent
it so it was too late.

Maybe this is an opportune time to chime in about auto-x.  Why not try
it out?  It's way funner than the street.  I wouldn't even own this
car if I wasn't able to get my gollies out at the track.  And, when
I finally get around to tracking it, I'm sure I'll be even happier
with the car than I am now!

Point taken, case closed.
