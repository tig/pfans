I'm using the Autothority chips for my car, and feel that there was a
bit of top end increase after chipping my car... but it wasn't as big
a performance as I thought it would be.  My guess is because the
pressure is increased, the efficiency of the turbo is not at 14psi, but
at stock boost levels, so the actual air density is not increased as
much as advertised.

There is definately a gain, but maybe even better if the intercooler is
increased in size, but from my research, the intercooler is already very
efficient in the 951's.

Correct me if I'm wrong please!!!
