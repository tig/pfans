i am not quite sure where he sees the advantage of a turbo.  a
supercharger gives you power all the way through the power band there is
NO ,NO, lag.  when you put your foot to the floor it is making boost all
the way until red line.  thusly there is no peak. a supercharger puts
approximately half the strain on an engine that a turbo does if the
engine is a good one.  there is NO reliability problem and a
supercharger NEVER has to be rebuilt.  One problem with them is that if
the belt that runs i
> 
> that being said i think since the Porsche cars tradionally rely on turbos they are probably the way to go.  leave the superchargers to the american muscle cars, like my stang!!

I have never sent a message to this list, so I hope it all goes well.
About the Supercharger ,turbo arguement, there are very large
differences in the two.
I own both a turbo porsche and a 8-71 (GMC styled) blown Camaro that I
drag race in the Fastest Street Car events.
I will have to agree with a few things that you say though Matt, yes
superchargers are the choice for max horsepower, but as you said leave
the superchargers to the american cars. I dont think the turbo porsches
would be the same as a supercharged car. I love having the turbo on my
porsche and would not change it to supercharged, regardless of how I
feel about them.

The MAIN reason for sending this message is because of the statement you
made about blower belt breakage and the results of a broken belt.
Many people dont realize that you can remove the blet from a blown
engine and it will run fine, of course you lose about 70% of your power,
but it will run fine, and if it breaks under throttle , not a problem
either. A few years back I was running the Camaro for my NHRA license
,and during one of the passes about 3/4 track the belt snapped(you can
even see the belt flop accross the track on the video tape :) ), well ,
the result, ......
nothing, I slowed down , drove back to my trailer and replaced belt.

Since this is not a really an all porsche subject, if anyone would like
to discuss blower vs. superchargers please send me e-mail directly.
I am not looking to argue, just discuss... I could still learn alot
about the subject myself.
