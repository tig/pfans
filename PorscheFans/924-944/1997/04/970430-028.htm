David, thanks for the e-mail on converting your 931 to 937 specs. 
If you cannot locate the 8.5 to 1 pistons, have the block decked .020"
to .040". That will help with the compression.  I don't know how close
to a 937 you are wanting to build.  The ign. box not being from a GT
should not really matter.  I do still have the factory parts manual,
shop specs and owners manual from my GTS Club Sport, so if you really
needed part numbers, I could furnish them to you.
     
     Yes, the head and cam are different, but with the proper cam grind,
the head really won't effect your car that much.  I will have to look up
the cam specs and I will e-mail you that info. tomorrow.  As I have told
others, a great thing to do is have the intake, exhaust, and head
extrude-honed.  Makes a lot of sense if you want some power.
     
     The 937 used a completely different intake, fuel distributor (8
plunger style with a Bosch # the same as one of the Ferrari's) that
necks down to 4 lines.  I seriously doubt you could find those parts. 
Your injection system can handle a fair more power than the 150-160 HP
that the stock motors have.  The injectors are just fine.  Do it right
and you can have a very tractable motor.

     If you already didn't have the GT intercooler, I would sugggest a
951 unit, along with a 944 radiator.  Fitment is pretty easy for the
intercooler and the 924 rad. hoses can adapt to the 944 rad.  You just
have to fabricate new mounts for the radiator.  They are not held in by
very much anyway.

     I've put many a lap in at T.W.S. in the 80's.  God place for you to
open such a car up.  Since this letter is so long, call me a t
(817)332-6547-off. or (817)294-5848 Ho. (if you can catch me home), and
we can discuss your project further.

Best wishes...Don Istook
