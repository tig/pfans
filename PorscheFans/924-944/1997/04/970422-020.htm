Makes sense to me. How full will the hub be with 60 grams of grease? How much 
air space is needed to prevent excessive pressure buildup? Are some greases 
more prone to creating gases as they become heated? Is this due to breakdown 
of the grease, or just out-gassing? If it is out-gassing, couldn't the hub be 
heated to out-gas, and allowed to cool prior to installing the cap? I would 
say that I had typically packed 80% -> 90% of available space with grease, but 
have not raced it yet, so maybe that is why I didn't run into any problems 
yet. (I used Mobile 1 synthetic, and am now trying Kendal with new bearings)

Thanks,
       Ezra
