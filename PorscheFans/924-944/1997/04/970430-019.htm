>What's the best brand of premium unleaded petrol for these cars?

In Western Canada (objective data), Chevron is the best with their 94
octane gasoline.  The older pumps currently are not using the oxygenated
gas, whereas the newer style pumps are.  Most of the pumps have been 
changed over though so you'll likely get the oxygenated gas everywhere.

>What's the best brand of oil for the engine?

(subjective data) Mobile 1 has worked quite well for me.  I used RedLine in
my last car and I loved it, but I did have piston ring problems in that car,
so I don't really know whether to recommend it or not, it's hard to pin-point
what causes what failure.

>Does it make a difference whether the engine is air cooled or water cooled?

I would think the air cooled motors would run hotter, but a good oil is a good
oil, regardless of what type of motor it is being used in.  Synthetic Mobile 1
in 15W50 or something like that should do just fine.

>Does it make a difference on the street as opposed to the racetrack?

Racetrack puts more load on everything and temperature durability is of prime
importance.  At the track, I would never run anything but synthetic.

>I realize these questions are mostly personal preference and choice, but
>hopefully somebody out there can give me a technical reason from the
>manufacturer's point of view for choosing one brand over another.

Well, I haven't given you a technical answer in either questions.  The fuel
quality was tested by a chemical engineer for me a while back.  We also tested
octane booster (the 104+ variety) with interesting results.  The other answers
are my personal opinion and should be taken as such :)

Wow, you guys really want to see the turbo cup videos don't you :)  As long as
I'm not violating any copyright laws, I will gladly copy them at no charge.
You can send me the tape or I can charge you for the tape ONLY.  I'm not
interested in profiting off anyone else's work.  I'm sure that Rothmans would
not mind me distributing their advertisement for them at no charge :)

When I get the tapes, I'll let the list know when I can make copies.

Farzaan.
