Hi all,

I'm going to upgrade my '88 944S (no ABS) brake system as I need new rotors
anyway. I have my hands on  2 pairs (full set) of calipers from a 968 and a
pair from an S4. Are they fairly similar and should I just install the
968's all round or put the S4 up front and the 968 on the rear. I know I
need to install new hub spindles. Anything else that I'll need to change?

As for rotors, I would dearly like to get a set of cross-drilled units. Any
suggestions on brands and where I could perhaps mail-order. The car is only
used for street and  occasionally autocrosses. I know that cross-drilled
probably aren't the best for street use but I have Carrera Cup wheels and
the huge openings are just waiting for a good-looking set of discs to be
placed behind them.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Steve.'88 944S -  Australia.
