Well, Todd Leen gave me some sage advice, ie. that no business can
improve without negative feedback, so I did the right thing and called
the manager of the dealership.

I recanted my tale(s) of woe, and he apologized, even guessing correctly
the name of the salesman with whom I had dealt.  He did not feel that
his prices were too high for parts, and suggested that I was buying
grey-market parts, but I shrugged that off as ignorance on his part (ie.
not being close enough to his service department), and decided then and
there to just get my parts elsewhere anyway.  I can't help it if he
doesn't want to deal.

I then told him that he is competing on a national basis, and that his
audience consists of not just the local market, but also of 1200+
PorscheFans, and that my feedback was shared equally with my friends on
the Internet.  He got downright RUDE.  He said he didn't appreciate me
sending "dirty FAXes across the nation" ?, and that it wasn't fair to
his dealership, which has the highest rating in the East for customer
satisfaction.  Granted, they have a great chief wrench, but three guys I
talked to here already said "Don't tell me, you went to Langan", so I
know they have a local reputation.

I'm going there this weekend for their AutoFest to see the Boxster
again, and to have my car 57-point inspected and oil-changed, and I will
draw my final conclusion then...  "But it don't look good."
