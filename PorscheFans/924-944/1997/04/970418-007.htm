okay i think it almost time to sya goodbye to my 944:
1985.5 944
guards red, 
black leather int./ with red panel trim and seat trim
115K mi. odo. stopped about 700mi. ago, will be fixed soon
has new belts(all including timing/balance)
new front tires/ less than 1000 mi.
recent oil change/castrol syntec
body in good to excellent cond (small dent over 944 badging, backed into lower part of my pickup:(  
int excellent (3 1/4 in. size cracks in dash
just finished work on the power steering parts.
large exhaust/not loud and obnoxious but deep and throaty
koni's
new shift boot/ red leather looks great.
 a lot of time and money put into my effort/ not to mention hard work and love
bra for front and mirrors
enough stereo wiring to kill someone /P.O. had a theatre in there!!!! all wiring good but only have the sony detach. face CD head unit
have all the receipts since i have owned the car, including gas!!!

discolsures:
1. could use a new front valance, the one on it is in good condition but it could use some paint to cover the lower part as we all know the get scratched.

2.  there is some key damage to the hood and mirrors.  nothing a painting couldnt fix.

3.  a new steering wheel wouldnt hurt as the leather is beginning to come off.

4.  could probably use an alignment as it is currently set up with neg. camber and pos. toe which causes some semi rough steering feed back at low highway speeds, from about 45-80, after that it is great!!!

will take any offer over 6800$U.S.

WTB:
951, any year. 
would prefer silver or red/ prefer grey int. the black is soooo dark with my tinted windows.
interior in good condition but overall not my main concern
exterior same conditions
would like all service records or a least the major ones.
dont care about the mileage.
want mechanically sound car, with new belts, water pump......
will do my own maintanance so not too worried about the little things, if there are such things on a porsche.  

dont have a whole lot of cash so i expect i might be able to afford an 87 with an luck.
willing to pay about 7200-7500$US, cash

thanks and sorry it is soooo long,
matt
