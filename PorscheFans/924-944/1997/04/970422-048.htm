My '77 924 doesn't seem to have any switch to activate the interior light
when the rear hatch opens. What is the car supposed to have?
I had a look at a 944s2 and it seemed to have either a micro or tilt switch
in the hatch itself (the tinting was too dark).
Any way if anyone knows the part no of what I need is, then drop me a line.
If not I'll look into a micro switch mounted near the top of the hatch
that rests (when closed) on the rubber seal. Seems better than a tilt
switch cause I often have to park on quite a slope and it'll trigger the alarm.
Also how about fitting the later model hatch seal to the earlier cars? It covers
up the locking mechanisms better then the old seal.

Thanks
