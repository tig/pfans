i think maybe we are forgetting that the older cars in america dont have to pass
the same emissions as the newer cars. things like no cat. on trucks and cars
that are older than 1977ish. it is possible that maybe the new regulations wont 
effect us except maybe a little higher cost, kind of like freon for older AC's.
while the  goverment said that everyone would have to convert there are still
(my est.) 4-7 million cars that dont have the newer systems and they are not
all going to change.  even if emissions are raised, think about all the smog 
producing 77 nova's and el caminos the blow so much oil that when you 
get behind them you have to make sure none of it gets on your windshield!
These people are never told to get off the streets, why are people who are barely 
over the legal limit be told they are producing too much pollution?
Maybe as a final thought a smart gruop of people like ourselves should tell 
the government that if they want more strict laws against people like us then
we want more strict control over garbage trucks, delivery trucks, dump trucks
etc. all of these are employed by the state or national govt. and are a far
worse contibutor than my 85.5 944!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
my .02 and the political drivvle comes from being a poly sci/law major!
