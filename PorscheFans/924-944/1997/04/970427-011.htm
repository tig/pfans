I just bought a georgeous 1994 968 Cab and have an annoying problem.  The oil warning light comes 
on intermittently.  Sometimes at highway speed (when going over bumps?), sometimes when I start 
the engine without shifting or moving the car.  Fortunately, I have the Porsche used car warranty, 
but the dealer indicates that the warning does not put any error code into the computer.  He has 
already changed out the circuit board and one of the sensors (although I understand there are 
multiple sensors for the warning light).  The oil pressure guage never fluctuates when this 
occurs.  Has anyone seen this problem or any ideas other than changing out the wiring.  I'd also 
be interested in knowing the sensor arrangement that ties into the light.  THANKS
