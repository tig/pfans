Hi there,

I'm looking for any ideas on how to retrofit my 1988 924S with the "sport
suspension" - M030 option, which came with some of these cars.  I got some
good advice from Dan Istook, and am looking now for a source for the
original front M030 struts that came with the 924S... (essentially a coil
over unit which allows ride height adjustment).  Where can I find such
parts?  Tried AutoAtlanta, but they wanted to sell me Bilstiens.  I'm
looking for original , rebuilt, or built to spec stuff. If I can't get it,
I'll need adjustable shocks at minimum- Bilstiens are good, but not
adjustable.  Anyone have source ideas?  Anyone with an M030 package who
wants to sell it?

Also looking for a ltd slip diff for the car, and a spare set of wheels -
15x6 front and 15x6/15x7 rears
