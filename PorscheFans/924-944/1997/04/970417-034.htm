As to the drag racer that mentioned that Superchargers are the best way
to make the most power.  I don't know if I agree with you.  From what
I've
read (I've never built a 2000hp turbocharged motor :]), the reason why
drag racers don't use turbocharged motors is because the rules do not
allow them to.  Is this a correct assumption?  Or is it because
turbochargers
are more difficult to launch?  The fastest I've ever gone at a track is
12.7
@ 107mph, so I'm not well versed in 200mph+ runs at the 1/4 mile :)

The reason why I make that assumption above is that many of the very
fastest race cars in the world rely on turbocharging to yank every last
HP they can get out of a motor, except in drag racing
_______________________________________________________________________

As I mentioned before, I am not looking to argue on this subject,just
wanted to place my opinion on this list.
Anyway, I absolutely love the turbo power I am getting from my Porsche
and think it is quite amazing what power the Porsche people can make out
of a small cube,turbo engine.
I have built both turbo and supercharged engines for drag racing, and
found out early that the turbo was not the correct road to take in this
sport.Yes, they make impressive power ,like the supercharger, but when
you run high in the Cube's , superchargers in my opinion are the better
choice for all out horsepower.
It seems like if ya wanna make max horsepower with a small cube engine,
turbo is the way to go, for the big 500+ cube engines, supercharging
will get ya there faster.
As for rules, you can run NA,Turbo,N02,Supercharger, or whatever ya
wanna bring. Atleast in the classes I run.
In other classes, as long as supercharging is in the rules, turbos are
included also. (as far as I know)
The amount of power that it takes to run the supercharger varies of
course from engine to engine, but the general rule is in the 30% range.
Now of course that sounds like alot, but when you look out the power
gain from supercharging the engine, you accept the 30% loss with a
smile.
As for me mentioning that supercharging is the best way to make power,
maybe it is better to say that supercharging is the best way to make
power in my sport, not in all racing sports.
Again , this is only my opinion.
