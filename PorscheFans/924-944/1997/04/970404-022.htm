Have you checked you distributor to see if the advance curve is as it
should be.
Don't know if it applies to the Porsche system but some cars change the
curve on
deceleration to help burn off excess fuel.  Maybe your's isn't right or
some other
anti-polution device is acting up.

I hate to admit it but I tried the splitfires in my 968.  Runs OK and
doesn't seem to
miss when cold as much as stock but not quite the power as before by
seat of the
pants guessing. No gas mileage improvement that I can tell but that was
about the
time winter gas went into effect so who knows.  My biggest surprise was
that the
original plugs have three electrodes so going to spitfires was really a
digression.
  Sorry I don't buy the guys story about the three electrodes blocking
the flame
front and yes Porsche does use plug with more than one electrode as
stock plugs.
From now on I'm sticking with stock Bosch-3 electrodes.   MYMV
