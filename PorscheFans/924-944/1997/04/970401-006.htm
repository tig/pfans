Just a quick comment for you track guys. I was at Roebling in January and a
944 had one of those on it. He spun in the last part of T1 and ran over
some minor curbing on his way to the grass. It broke the lip up, but he
didn't realize it at the time and drove back on track after traffic
cleared. It ended up doing even more damage and the session was
black-flagged to allow the car to be towed off. So you might want to think
about where you drive (or what you might have to drive over) before buying
one of those.
