I have had both the D40 M2's and XGTV's.  I am running the XGTV's right now
on my 951, and I am not very happy with them.  The D40's seemed stickier in
both the wet and dry, and the Michelins are the noisiest things in the world
when you're going over 30 mph.  The Michelins aren't wearing as well as the
D40's did, either.  I'm trying the Dunlop SP Sport 8000's this June, which
is a newer and probably better design than the D40 that only costs a bit
more per tire.  It's not the stickiest thing you can buy, but it offers
decent grip and a longer life than more aggressive Yokohamas at a relatively
inexpensive price.  IMHO, I would suggest going with the Dunlops...
