At the end of last season I got a set of the new 032R Yokos for my series I
944.  I drove a bit on the street but not on the track yet.  A BMW
acquaintance claimed that these tires are far more temperature sensitive
than the 008rs Yokos which preceded them.  The handling is supposed to be
something between the 008rs and the R1s.  

Does anyone have information, especially for 944 drivers, regarding pressure
settings for these tires on the track? What are you running them at?  Front
rear differences??   Overall evaluations are welcome too.   

I asked a similar question last fall.  Hopefully some of you in warmer
climates now have some experience with the 032s on the track.  The snow is
finally clear from most of our tracks now!
