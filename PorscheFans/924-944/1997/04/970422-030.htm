That depends on the state.  In Massachusetts, it's illegal, and no shop
will do it for you.  Plus, it almost certainly won't pass inspection.

The problem is that most harmful emissions are reduced to a negligible
level before even entering the exhaust pipes under the car.  (Actually,
that's good.)  But nitrous oxides, IIRC, can't be re-combusted as
efficiently as carbon monoxide or dioxide and other emissions.

This means that you'll pass the CO tests in flying colors, but flags will
go up everywhere in the system if your state tests NO content -- as it
almost certainly will.  However, if the 944 *still* passes... well, that
would surprise me, but it *might* happen.

The rule of thumb as I've heard it applied is to either replace the
catalytic converter right before inspection and take it off again right
after, or only do it on a car that's been grandfathered.  (I think the
current magic number is 1982.  Can anyone correct me on that?)
