Anders:

I appreciate and share your concern with environamental problems caused by
the discharge of freon into the atmosphere. However, living in Arizona where
summer tempertures often exceed 120 degrees my prospective is a little
differant than yours. A/C is essential.

I have spent many hours in exhaustive research into freon alternatives. The
auto industy has accepted R-134A as the official replacement for R-12. This
is fine for newer cars designed for the higher pressures of R-134A. But it
is problematic when retrofitted to older A/C systems. The blends such as
Frig-C are more aggressive and attack O-rings, seals, and hoses. Other
blends are flamable thus extremely dangerous in the event of an accident.
There does not yet appear to be any acceptable alternative to freon R-12 for
older cars. Hence my decision to stock up and use R-12, until an acceptable
replacement is developed.

The US has outlawed the manufacturer, remanufacturer, and importation, of
R-12 freon.  We are allowed to use, and recycle, old stocks of freon, but it
must be recovered into proper containers and disposed of according to strick
EPA regulations. Venting freon into the atmosphere carries penalties up to
$25,000 per occurance. You can be assured I will not be venting my freon
into the atmosphere.

Anders, I hope this will set your mind at ease about my unethicial decision
to stock up on freon.  Right now there simply is not any viable alternative
to freon for my '84 XJ-S Jaguar or my '82 924 Porsche. I certainly hope
someone does develope a workable alternative long before my 10 year supply
runs out.

BTW,  the reason I even posted this to the list was to let others know of
the good deals sometimes available through internet classified ads. This is
a parts and tool source some of us may not have considered in the past.

Michael
