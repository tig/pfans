The red beast lives!!!!

The laundry list of problems is forgotten.  Off to the time trials!  The
first day turns out to be less than satisfactory.  The machine has bursts
of brilliance but the old cutout problem has returned with a vengeance.  It
is like the rev limiter cutting in and out.  My instructor's head looks
like he is auditioning to become a rear window doll with the head on a
spring.  After three 20 minute runs, I have had enough and my instructor is
searching for sea sick pills.  A quick phone consultation with the master
ends with him off in search of a substitute brain.  "Excuse me, could you
lend me a cup of sugar and a brain?"  Dr. Frankenstein and Egor install the
borrowed brain.  A test drive reveals the surgery to be a success.  The
post surgery inspection shows the days activities have taken a toll.  It
seems Egor has not properly torqued the AC  hold down bolt (missing in
action) and the oil pressure sending unit has gone south.  Midnight oil is
on the menu.  The doctor and Egor somehow refrain from strangling each
other long enough to complete the work.

The second day of the time trials begin with success.  The beast has big
time midrange power.  My new instructor's command is "make them catch you".
 I blow away the tail biters on the straights and almost hold my own in the
turns.  We fly around the course and no one catches me.  I am pumped!  

On the second run, a 914 has the nerve to pass me at the end of the warm up
lap.  I dog him around the track, gain a little, get a bit sideways and
lose a little.   Powering out of the final sweeper onto the straight away
the rearend gets loose as I floor it.  Third gear to the floor, "you are
mine sucker", hit forth gear and go through the dip approaching the end of
the straight.  Whoa!  Spinout, we are sideways at 90 mph with flames
shooting out the side of the car, then  backwards with flames shooting out
the front.  A quick glance in the rearview mirror reveals the cement
barrier approaching at warp speed.   With both the clutch and brake to the
floor, we stop before saying hello the the wall.   I had the right line,
how could I of spun?  Reality sets in as people are yelling to get out of
the car, it is on fire.  The 914 driver had spotted the flames just before
the spin and runs up with his fire extinguisher.  The fire is out.  A
corner worker arrives to snuff the final flicker.  

Big time oil spill, the red beast has pumped the better part of 15 quarts
of Mobile 1 on the track.  I'll be on the EPA's ten most wanted list. 
(Tech Tip:  Oil is not conducive to traction, just fire)  The tire oiler
patent is still available if anyone is interested.

A quick inspection shows minimal fire damage.  Rather than driving home in
glory, I ride with the tow truck driver.  So is the life of boy racer.
