Hi Andy, welcome to the list.

always.  There's new tires on (cheap ones - Yokohama 302's I think), and they
"appear" to be balanced, that is there are at least "some" weights glued inside
the wheel.

It is not uncommon for glued weights to fall off.  Since wheel balancing is
relatively cheap, I'd go ahead and do it.

1.  When I'm just driving along there is a distinct "hum" (like "vvvvvvvvvvv")
that sounds like tire noise.

other tires (to rule the tires out)?

Your balance shafts might not be timed correctly.  When one of my balance
shafts was 180 degrees out of phase, there was a distinct vibration through the
knob it was almost a buzzing type feel.
