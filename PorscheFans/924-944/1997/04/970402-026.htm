The Canada West Region recently had a tech night on detailing. It was
amazing what a good tech could do. I would check out some of the detail
shops in your area. Shop around most of them are clueless. If you want to
try your self, start with paint cleaning clay and a fine polish. This will
remove most defects that don't go through the paint. A good wax can then
fill the rest. Not as good as a paint job but much cheaper and may turn out
as good as a partial paint job.
