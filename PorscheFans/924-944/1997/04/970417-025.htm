Ok, summer's coming an the car is starting to heat up again after the long
winter.
I bought my car in Feb. and I've had just a couple of problems with it. I've
solved
all of them, exept a sunroof problem that I caused myself. Just a couple of days
later when I had bought the car, I just had to play with the sunroof even
when it
was -25 degrees outside(I live in Finland). Anyway, something went all wrong...
  When I'm not driving with the car, everything is ok, the sunroof works
perfectly.
_BUT_, when I start driving the sunroof just tries to open itself! And the
damn thing
wont quit at all, just keeps going. I have to press the 'sunroof down'
switch and then it
will stop, but even then it wont close. It will only start to work again
when I stop
the car. When I do that everything is just perfect. 
  The switch works and I've also replaced both of the sunroof relays located
in the 
back of the car, but the problem hasn't gone away. Now I've just taken the
relays out
and the sunroof wont do anything. I can still remember that when the sunroof
still worked,
it locked when I was driving(the two clamps went to a notch in the sunroof).
  I really hope someone could figure this out.. The Haynes-manual doesn't
have anything
on the sunroof and I'm just out of ideas.

  Best regards,
  
  Timo Pantsari
