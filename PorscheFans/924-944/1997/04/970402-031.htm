I think i have found a way around spending large $$$$ on buying new 
lifters.
It seems using common engineering practices the lifters can be repaired.
as long as the wear is not too deep as i have seen on neglected cars 
they are salvageable.
the process is basically refacing the surface and applying a few thou of 
hard chrome.
i faced mine on the side of a grinding wheel then spun in a lathe using 
sandpaper to finish.the finish should have a mirror like finish after 
sanding and be in a slight dome shape.Note measure lifter first to 
establish how much height you have removed.
Hard chroming is extremely hard (80 rockwell) and only a few thou is 
needed.too much chrome and you run the risk of flaking(hard chrome shops 
can best reccomend max layer for ensured safety).
Have the cam ground also if any wear is evident on it.you will most 
likely need new adjusting screws to compensate for the amount taken off 
the cam and lifter.Try if possible set it up so you still have 
adjustment left as parts settle in.
Remember if you have done work on the cam run it in correctly as 
reccomended by the shop who did the work.
I did my parts at $12 (Qty8)New Zealand each compared to $150 for a new 
part each..
and $50 for the cam grind compared to $350 for a new cam.I found a used 
car part supplier that let me borrow all his used adjusting screws and 
only take what i needed (why buy new they still work ok) giving me 
access to trying various sizes.
remember torque settings and careful with the oil feed tube.Replace the 
front camshaft seal while you have the shaft out,it's easy.
Any doubts follow the Haynes manual.
