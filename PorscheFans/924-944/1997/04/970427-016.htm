Those "big clunky things" have saved my car from hundreds/thousands of
dollars in damage on numerous occasions.  (I assume you're referring to the
extended rear bumper with the two massive rubber pads.)
        I have unfortunately been rear-ended 3 times and my 951 survived
practically unscathed each time.  While the first 2 incidents occurred near
stoplights at speeds of less than 10 mph, the third involved a Honda Accord
that hit me at at least 25 mph while I was stopped in traffic.  My car was
bumped forward about 2-3 feet and I feared the worst (luckily I didn't hit
the guy in front of me- thank you Metal Masters!).  When I got out of my
car, I swear I thought I had just become a victim of a hit-and-run because
there was no car behind me!  It turns out that the Honda Accord had BOUNCED
over 2 car-lengths backward after impact!  The only damage to my car (I had
everything checked out at my shop afterward) was a small nick in the bumper
paint where the Honda's license plate screw had made contact.
        Those "big clunky things" are also good protection against people
who can't parallel-park.  I once found another car kissing my bumper and the
driver had parked right up against one of the rubber pads, compressing it
about half an inch but keeping the rest of the painted bumper safe.
        I don't know how well the thinner and smaller European rubber pads
would have held up against these abusive and potentially expensive
situations.  Just some thoughts to consider before trading in your U.S.
bumper for the European one (in the rear at least).
