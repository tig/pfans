I own a 924 and can promise you that it is a lot easier to work on than a
944 in every sense.  For oil change it every 3000.  924's put out 115
except for the 77 which dropped down to 100.  I also cannot think of a
time when I needed an "Audi" or "VW" part.  Most of the interchangeable
parts like that are made by Bosch etc.  924s are a fun little car to drive
around.  And if you would like a 77 that has been owned by a Porsche
mechanic for the last 4 years I have one for 2000 and I will deliver it
for delivery expenses.
