Whoever said, "If things always went as planned we would all be bored",
never installed a 944 turbo engine with minor modifications.  

We are closing in on the prize, I can sense that we are getting close.  The
master, who seems to have a childlike enthusiasm for every task no matter
how mundane, is more manic than ever.  We work 19 straight hours until 2:30
in the morning and we have spark!  Not just your common run of the mill
spark but MSD multi-spark turning the air to ozone.  I catch it on video
for future generations to marvel at, St. Elmo's fire big time.  I drag
myself home knowing we are almost there.

The next day brings sore legs and back.  Leaning over the engine takes its
toil.  After a few Advil and coffee, I limp into the master's shop.  We
start the final assembly knowing that we are close.  Something does not
look right.  A tour of the Haynes manual and my Turbo Supplement do not
shed any light.  There is too much room on the left side of the engine. 
This is not Porsche like, something has to fit in there.  A tour of the
shop reveals a large, and until now, forgotten heat shield.  The master
attacks it with his usual, "piece of cake", attitude and I grumble as I
pull the throttle cable, dip stick tube and assorted hoses.  The heat
shield does not go without a fight.  Hopefully no chunks of his skin or
blood have fallen into the turbo intake.

The day continues on a downward spiral as I knock over a cylinder of helium
when changing an argon bottle.  I receive a lecture about blowing up the
shop and create a bit of tension when I point out if it was so dangerous,
it should of had a chain around it.  We continue on in stoney silence.  

Things are about back to normal, if there is a normal with the master, when
he appears holding a mass of hoses and metal tubes.  These certainly will
not fit on my engine, there is no room.  He twists and turns the hoses and
proclaims that they belong under the intake manifold.  A logical mind would
ask why they were not installed before the manifold went on, unfortunately
there are no logical minds present so I start pulling the intake.  On the
forth intake removal, I am getting pretty good at intake pulling, the
master has the hoses are all fitted and I tighten down the manifold.  The
rest of the parts go on with minor struggles.  The time has come, the
master places a socket on the crank bolt to turn the engine a final time.

He informs me the engine is frozen.  I reply that it is not April Fools and
I am not amused.  A push on the breaker bar confirms the worst.  Somehow,
since yesterday, the engine has locked up.  The spark plugs and starter are
removed and the engine still will not move.  We start retracing our steps
to find the cause.

(Tech Tip:  when installing the rear flywheel sensor, make sure you include
the spacer under the sensor)  Ok, so I forgot the spacer and the pressure
of the sensor on the flywheel made the engine so it would not turn.  The
sensor is replaced and the engine turns freely.

We crank the engine without spark plugs to fill the lines, filter,
separator and accumulator with oil.  The beast drinks 15 quarts of Mobil 1.
 I am not looking forward to my first oil change.  We add it up and 15
quarts is about right.

The moment is at hand, I start the video and get ready to turn the key. 
The master makes some final adjustments and I crank the engine.  Vroooom,
we have ignition, the beast lives.  There is joy in Muddville.  After a
short run, I am signalled to kill the engine.  The video is rewound and I
watch to relive the moment.  Several minutes of the masters butt as he
makes final adjustments and then nothing.  The battery in the camera has
run out of juice at the critical moment.  The way things are going, I
decide my bed is the safest place and head in that direction.  No sense in
pushing our luck any more.
