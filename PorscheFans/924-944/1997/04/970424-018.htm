I have driven with the Peachstate Region and have found them to be an
excellent group of people. You have to remember that those you call and
email are doing the job gratis and are busy just like the rest of us, so
maybe they are flooded with email or their mailbox is full or whatever.

That would most likely be ATE Super Blue. If you siphon it out and use the
amber colored ATE you will be able to see when all of the blue is out of the
lines. Alternate to the Blue next flush for the same effect. Those are good
fluids for the track, and are not expensive.

You need to buy a Haynes book on the 944. Pep Boys has them for about $13
and it will cover the basic maintenance items (but not much more).

You'll have to have it inspected by a shop to drive with Peachstate. This is
not 100% enforced but it is an excellent idea for a first-timer new to the
car. The acceptance packet from Peachstate will include a tech inspection form
and that is probably a good thing for you to use for your own pre-track
inspection before you take it to the shop. Ask around your area, because
some shops are PCA-event-friendly and will do the inspection for $25-$50.
Others don't know what a track event is, so if there isn't immediate
recognition of what you want, go somewhere else.

Call the event organizer (listed in Pano) and get an application. If
you haven't already registered for the May event you might be getting close
on time, because it will fill up fast.

If you like your Porsche now, you will love it once you have had it on
the track. Hats off to you for having the good sense to get out there and
learn something about your Porsche and your driving skills!

Have fun!
