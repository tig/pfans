The exact requirements for helmets vary by each region.

Your best bet (in order to satisfy every region's requirements for the
longest period of time) is a helmet that meets Snell SA95 standards.
(SA stands for Special application, 95 means the 1995 standard - currently
the latest).

There is a difference between motorcycle and SA helmets, primarily being
the fire resistance rating. The motorcycle helmet standard also provides
for slightly better peripheral vision.

The best place to buy one is probably your local motorcycle or speed 
shop, where you can try on helmets to get the proper fit. 

Enjoy the ride...


Good Luck!
