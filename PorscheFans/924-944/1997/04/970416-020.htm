There's a dealer in my area where several parts personnel and the manager of
used Porsche sales couldn't figure out how to put a license plate on the
front of my 951.  (I didn't buy the car there, but I went there thinking
they would have what I was looking for.)  I insisted that there must be a
bracket available that fits in the holes or something, but everyone there
assured me that there was no such thing.  I had seen them before and have
seen them since- too bad there were no used 944 turbo's or S2's on their lot
at the time that I could have used as examples.  If I had wanted real
answers, I guess I should have asked the kid who washes the cars and mounts
the cardboard tags that say "XXXXXX Porsche Dealership" on the front of
every car they sell.  He would have been able to help me more than those
other guys.

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
