You can do that right now.  The key thing to remember when running a turbo
charged car in racing is that you must learn form a fast turbo guy (person).
When I first started autocrossing, I was very lucky to find a person who
was not only fast, but also drove a turbocharged car.  He assisted me in
what lines to take, etc, and how to enter slow, exit fast as that allows 
better boost response on the exit.  

While I am merely OK at autocross, I fly at the track.  That smooth driving
style, etc. really works well at the track.  Scotty White blows the doors
off everyone in his S2 at the track because of his skill that I think he
learnt at autocross.

When you are learning, you will find that many of the instructors drive
NA cars and they quite frankly, have no idea how to drive a turbo car.  The
best thing to do is find someone that is quick but drives a turbo car.  I 
don't think there are any books on driving turbo cars, but you really shouldn't
have lag being a major problem at the track, maybe at the autocross, but not
on the track.  We have pretty tight courses out here, but I've not yet been
upset at the lag.

BTW - when I say, learning above, I'm not implying that you are a novice driver
or anything like that, I'm just making assumptions because you said you've
just started.
