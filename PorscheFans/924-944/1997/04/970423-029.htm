At the request of a few people, I'll put down my experience with replacing my
cam shaft seal today.  I own an '89 944 turbo with the auto-tensioning device.
 The car has one Cam shaft. (8v opposed to 16v)

This is from memory, so bear with me...

I received the new seal yesterday.  It seems that Porsche has again updated the
seal.  Hopefully this one works better than the last one I put in last fall.  I
also got a new o-ring and a new plastic (celaphane?) washer.

Here is a list of procedures in the order that I did them:


Remove turbo to intercooler tube.  Requires 17mm socket and regular
screwdriver.

Remove airbox.  The intake tube (from fender) simply pulls out from the slot,
you might have screws securing it to the airbox.  You need to loosen the clamp
on the intake boot to the airbox.  Remove the top of the box.  Loosen/Remove
the 10mm bolts holding the base of the thing down.  The whole box should come
out.  You do not need to separate the metal airflap from the plastic filter
box.

Detach ignition coil wire from distributor.  Remove distributor (however leave
the wires on it).  You'll need a stubby regular screwdriver.  To remove push
the screws in and turn clockwise.

Remove the rotor (6mm allen screw) and the plastic cover on the rotor.

Remove the upper front belt cover (6 10mm bolts).  Carefully pull it out from
behind the P/S pump belt.  Remove the metal cover over the cam sprocket (3 10mm
bolts).

Turn the engine so that it is at TDC, there are TDC markings on the cam shaft
sprocket and the OT marking in the fly wheel housing port for TDC.

Mark the belts position on the cam sprocket, this is so you can put the belt on
the exact same tooth as you took it off.

Loosen the auto tensioner (loosen (don't remove) the two 13 mm bolts on it) and
carefully slip the belt (don't bend or twist it) off the cam sprocket.  You'll
probably have to apply counter pressure on the auto tensioner.

Loosen the 8mm bolt on the front of the cam shaft, this holds the shaft that
the rotor mounts on.  That shaft should pull out of the sprocket retaining
thingy once you loosen the 8mm bolt.

Using a lare wrench to hold the sprocket still (it fits on the hex bolt shape
on the front of the sprocket)  loosen the 8mm triple-square bolts on the front
of the sprocket.  If you turn the sprocket at all, move it back to its TDC
markings.

Pull the bolt and the sprocket retainer off the cam shaft.  Pull the sprocket
off.  Remove the keyway thingy.


Now you can remove the cam shaft seal.  However if you want to replace the
o-ring and the thin plastic seal, and the other thingy(small donut), you'll
need to do the following.  The following can be done, however it isn't the
correct way to do this, to do this correctly, remove all the belts, pulleys and
the rear cover.  I hold no responsibility for anyones mishaps...

Remove the two 10mm bolts holding the rear plastic cover to the cam shaft front
housing.  Remove the 3 10mm bolts holding the front housing to the cam shaft
housing.  Carefully pull the front housing off the cam housing.  The rear belt
cover will flex as you pull it off.  Mine flexed enough to allow me to remove
the front housing.  If you get worried about rear belt cover, stop...  You'll
have to remove the rear cover.

Wipe off old oil from all surfaces.

Remove old o-ring.  Coat new o-ring with oil, put on.  Put new donut in, no
oil.  Slide thin plastic seal (covered with oil) over the cam shaft (coated
with oil).

----if you didn't remove the front housing you can still do the following---

Remove seal.  These things are a pain in the butt.  I finally got frustrated
and went over to the neighbor dude.  To remove this seal easily, insert a
regular screwdriver between the inner lip of the seal and the front shaft
piece, pry the seal out.  It took my neighbor 5 seconds.  This is one of those
things that I was afraid to try because I didn't want to screw anything up...oh
well, nothing wrong with feeling foolish.

Remove any divots formed by the previous person who changed the seal but felt
that the seal wouldn't stay in place with out wedging the aluminum against it.
 This is so the new seal will be able to put into to place relatively easily.

Coat inner part of seal with oil, coat metal peice with oil, slide piece into
seal making sure the lip of the seal is facing outwards, the newer seals don't
really have a lip, they have and edge that doesn't flip in or out.  Tap new
seal into place on the front cam housing.

Put a layer of oil on all metal pieces, and put front housing onto the cam
housing carefully.  Tighten the 3 10mm bolts to correct torque (I think it is 8
newton-meters).  Tighten the 2 10 mm bolts of the rear cam cover to the
housing.  Put keyway on shaft, you might need to push the metal sleave back a
little.

Put sprocket on, put sprocket retainer and bolt back on tighten to 70 n/m.
(remember to hold the sprocket steady).

Carefully slide timing belt over timing sprocket in it's original position.  If
you have accidently slipped some teeth, make sure that the OT mark is visible
in the bell housing hole, and make sure the TDC mark is aligned on the cam
shaft sprocket.  Tighten the auto - tensioner down (~ 20 nm).

Rotate the engine one around to TDC again.  Make sure nothing is colliding
inside the engine.  Loosen the two 13 mm bolts on the tensioner, press the
tensioner down so it loosens the belt then let back up.  Retighten the two 13mm
bolts.

Everything else goes back together reverse of taking it apart.


Good luck!!!
