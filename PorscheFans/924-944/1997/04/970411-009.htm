Dave,

Just from what you've described it could be one of two things.  I'd say
check the clutch slave cylinder or it could actually be the clutch.  I'm
new to Porsches but clutches work the same for most cars.  This same
senario happened with my wife's 88 Accord Coupe when it hit about 155k
miles.  I knew right away the clutch was gone.  Of course when asking her
how long this has been going on I got the typical response "well it's been
hard to shift lately".  sheesh. (apologies to any female list members)

Good Luck and hopefully someone else might know a more specific resolution.
