I just spent the last year looking for what I considered to be a =
reasonable deal on a good 89 944T.  I did not find one.  What I found =
were a large number of these cars being sold by private owners for what =
I felt were unreasonable prices.  Let me clarify.

I started by check both NADA and Kelly Blue Book for average retail.  =
What many fail to realize is the prices listed in both the NADA book and =
the Kelly Blue Book are an average of the price dealers sell the =
particular car for.  Since typically dealers sell cars on the high side =
of the price model I felt this was a good place to start.  The on-line =
Kelly Blue Book lists the 89 944T at a retail price of $15325 USD.  I =
never found a car in what I would expect as average condition for this =
price.

What I found was many of the club racing guys were snatching these cars =
up at prices in the 19k - 25k range.  I'm sorry, but I don't think this =
car is worth that kind of dough.  Even the dealers I spoke with felt =
those prices were too high.

I ended purchasing a 93 968.  A car I had never even considered until I =
went and test drove one.  Following the test drive, I looked up articles =
on it in past Excellence and European car (no access to pano) issues.  =
The reviewers all had good things to say about it.  More or less the =
same performance as a stock 944T. =20

So, unless you have to have a turbo, consider a 968.  I have begun to =
think it is the most under-rated Porsche to date.

Thanks for your indulgence.

Like Barry, I also own an Alpine White '89 944 Turbo; I agree with
everything he said about it. I looked for this car for more than six =
months
before I found one, and when it came along, I snapped it up immediately =
--
I put a deposit down an hour after I saw the car and picked it up the =
next
day. I know for a fact that several other people were ready to buy my =
car,
so they don't stay on the market long.

Luckily, mine was in excellent condition: low mileage, perfect
body/interior, strictly-dealer maintained, and clutch, water pump, and
timing belt recently done.

Prices range from around $15k to $25k. With the 'S' cars I've found that
the owners either (a) take very good care of them, or (b) race them =
and/or
drive them very hard. [These conditions are not necessarily mutually
exclusive.] Because these cars offer incredible performance while being
very easy to drive, they're popular on the track.

I also looked at 968s but decided that I wanted a 951S because of the =
extra
power, larger brakes, and suspension goodies.

advertised

Autoweek.

I agree -- the paper won't be much help. Read Pano, and if you have =
friends
in other PCA regions across the country, enlist their help -- assuming
you're willing to travel. I found my car with Classifieds 2000, one of =
the
better on-line used car sites. They have a service which will notify by
e-mail when a car meeting your criteria shows up in their listings.

  http://www.classifieds2000.com/

Good luck. If I come across any advertisements I'll forward them to the =
list.
