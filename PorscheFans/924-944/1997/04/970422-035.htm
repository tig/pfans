If you put in a 4.0L twin-turbocharged flat-six with valves operated by
dual overhead camshafts, stripped out and replaced the transmission
with a six-speed manual or five-speed Tiptronic auto, redesigned the body
to be more aerodynamic and use more modern alloys, took out the suspension
and put in stuff like MacPherson struts and new, 18" wheels, moved the
engine to the rear for better handling characteristics (of course,
balancing the weight with as much as possible in the front), took off the
OEM brakes and replaced them with massive discs on all four wheels, and
gave the car LSD (happy now?), that Yugo should really fly.

Hmm.  That car sounds really familiar, somehow.  Maybe it's an option.

				conversation, n.: a vocal competition
     icarus@berkshire.net	in  which the one who is catching his
