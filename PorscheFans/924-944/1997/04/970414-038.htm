Ed,

        I am really sorry that you have had to put up with the abuse of
other list members who are fortunate enough to have the luxury of receiving
posts in the form they desire most.  It's truly a shame that the digest has
been experiencing difficulties, and an even greater shame that others cannot
sympathize with your position.  This list, after all, operates on the
concept of sharing and solving the technical problems of others.  Yes, it's
true we've all been hearing complaints and inquiries about the digest
problem for weeks now, but we've been hearing about the same old clutch,
sunroof, bearings, and water pump problems for even longer.  We understand
that these problems happen to everyone all the time and we patiently provide
the answers to those in need without hesitation each and every day.  While I
thank my lucky stars that my timing belt is still intact every time I read a
post about someone else who has had theirs die, I still have compassion for
that other fellow.  I wish I could offer constructive advice to everyone
about every problem, but I can't.  But at least I don't tell someone with a
important concern to "blank off" when I don't know the answer.  "Can't we
all just get along?"

Fondly,
Ben

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
