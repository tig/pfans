A mechanical (micro)switch that stops them in parked position. May need
some cleaning and lubrication. Seems like the grease have hardened and
may be blocking the free movement of the parking switch - as it works (a
little) when the wiper motor is warm. Check the wiper motor first,
before buying any switches or relays.    
It works like this: The on-off switch (steering column arm) is connected
in parallell to the inbuilt wiper parking switch - and via a two step
(actually three step - seen the extra frantic wawing of the wipers when
flushing the windscreen ?)
switch, two (three) different voltages are fed to the wiper motor.
Sounds much more complicated that it really is. When turning on the
wiper, the on-off switch takes preference, when turning of the wiper,
nothing happens - until the parking switch (parallell - remember?) turns
off the current. Voila - auto parking wipers.

Very good advise. Remember that the 944 is made out of galvanized steel
- very good protection against rust. It really takes something more than
pure water to make these panels rust. There is paint available that
protects against acid, and it may be well spent time to take out the
battery and clean and paint that area.
