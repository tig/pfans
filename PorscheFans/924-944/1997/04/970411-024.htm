There apparently is, but you don't need it unless your oil cooler is
leaking or plugged.  I'm not sure what (if any) benefit this updated cooler
would provide other than putting you out several hundred dollars.  But if
you're replacing the oil cooler seals and since your car is the same as
mine, I would strongly advise that you replace the oil pressure relief
valve while you have everything apart.  The reason I suggest this is that
my car had oil cooler seals that needed replacing and the water and oil was
mixing and forming a nasty, sticky sludge that was clogging my oil pressure
relief valve.  Oddly, one of the symptoms was that the car was getting very
hard to start when cold-- the valve was sticking open and the starter motor
was having to supply full, unrestricted pressure through all the galleys
while also trying to start.

It gets better:

The original oil pressure relief valve is a three-piece unit which is
impossible to reinsert correctly, even with the special tool.  Porsche must
have realized this since they released a self-contained, one-piece valve in
later cars ('87 on, I think) and also provided a retrofit valve just for
earlier cars.  When I had my seals replaced (I didn't have a place to do it
myself at that time), the mechanic reused the three-piece valve and it
worked for a while until, without any warning whatsoever, it stuck full
open while I was driving.  80 psi of oil pressure will find the weakest
point in your engine and escape.  I was fortunate since this, for me, was
the oil filter.  It blew oil all over the exhaust manifold, which made for
quite a show.  Another member of this group blew his head gasket ($$$).
So, if you're going to do this job, I feel it's definitely worth the
updated part (it was $215 about 2 years ago--ouch!).  Just don't let anyone
tell you that you have to buy a different cooler as well-- you don't.
There is a separate retrofit pressure-relief valve for our cars.  If you
can't get a shop that knows about this, write me and I'll get you the part
number.

Anyway, for what it's worth, there you have it.  Have fun with this job- I
hear it's a real mess!
