Before I ramble about my car being generally fixed, does anyone know how to 
fix a windshield washer nozzle that doesn't squirt well?  My passenger side 
one is hi-pressure, and my driver's side one is wimpy.  I tried cleaning it 
out with a small piece of wire, to no avail.

Well, the last time I posted to the list (6 months or so ago), my car was a D. 
O. G..., and I didn't know why.  So, I drove on up to AutoSports and had them 
take a look.  Come to find out, my local shop, which had rechecked the timing 
twice on AutoSports' suspicion, had grinched up some parts, (cam bolt, etc.), 
and failed to notice that the cams had been re-installed (at some point in the 
past), with the cam lobes separated by 101mm instead of the proper 113mm.  
Seems they were off a tooth or so.  That being corrected, and a chip being 
added, (and a veritable slew of other little things like factory alarm being 
fixed, gauges being re-aligned, broken starter replaced, new chain tensioner, 
etc.), the car runs W. E. L. L.   I could best define it as solid, everywhere 
in the RPM range, and any time I want to step on the gas!  The drive back from 
Maine was "a 6 hour grin"...

All is well with the world.
