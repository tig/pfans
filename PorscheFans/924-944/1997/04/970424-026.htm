I agree with Tracy and my experience has been similar on an 87 951. I use
Metal Masters around town with shims to stop the rattling and I use Hawk
pads on the track. I haven't used Performance Friction pads ($$$) but I
have been very pleased with the Hawks. But, for the same reasons Tracy
cited, you can't use them around town, plus they are *very* dusty.

By the way, the shims are not a big deal. I bought a simple aluminum sign
at Home Depot and I cut shims out of it with tin snips. They don't require
perfection!
