Hello All,

Does anyone out there have a cross-referenced list for paint codes and
colors?  I'm trying to find out the color of my 1984 944 . . . . . the paint
name sticker in the engine compartment is missing.  The paint code from the
sticker in the spare tire compartment is "LM1Y".  The color is a light
metallic gold.  I called the Porsche dealer (who was rather brusque -
surprise, surprise) and he said that I must've read it wrong and it must be
"LM1V" because there is no "LM1Y".  Well, he's wrong!  This is a
computer-generated printed sticker and it definitely is "LM1Y".

So, what color is it?  If I could further impose, I'd like the name in both
german and english.

Thanks in advance,
Rich Freitas

Don't know what color it is!
