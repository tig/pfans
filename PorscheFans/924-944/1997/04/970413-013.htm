I was under my toy last night and noticed some, apparently fresh, oil on the
belt tightening rod for the power steering pump.  Poking around more, I found
a thin coat of oil (not fresh, but gritty) on the bottom of the plastic cam belt
housing.  Back up top, I removed the cam belt cover and found that the belt tensioner
has some oil on its body, and more on the tensioning spring (this is the built-in
belt tension gauge, not the tensioning sprockets).  The belts, rollers, sprockets
are clean (belts were replaced by shop 7K miles ago).  I suspect (worry) about a
possible seal leak at the upper balance shaft.  Any thoughts?  How would I pinpoint
this as the location?  How much might this cost to fix - should an inexperienced
home mechanic attempt it?

Thanks in advance
