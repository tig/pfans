You didn't say how many miles are on your car but my advice would be to
replace the master and slave at one time since you have to open the
hydraulics anyway (and chances are good that if one is well-worn, so is the
other).  You can do this job quite cheaply and easily.  I just did it and
paid only $98.00 (including sales tax & shipping!) for both parts from
Vertex in Miami (see ad in Panorama).  They are original equipment FAG
parts too.  Even if you could find a rebuild kit, I'll bet the price would
not be much less than buying the complete new assemblies.  You may want to
take a close look at the flexible hose leading down to the slave while your
at it.  I had to replace a leaky one a few years back (had to buy it at the
dealer, unfortunately).
