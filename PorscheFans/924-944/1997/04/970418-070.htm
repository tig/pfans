The only motor flush that my Porsche trained mechanic would endorse for use
in my cars was that made by "LUBRO MOLY".(I don't remember the name)  He
did not recommend using engine flush in any of the 944s except the 944S,
since according to him the 16 valvers were prone to carbon on the valves
and when the valves were cleaned, again only using Lubromoly's Ventil
Saulber (valve cleaner) he would use engine flush before changing the oil.
Just some anecdotal information without any basis in science.  Use your own
discretion.
