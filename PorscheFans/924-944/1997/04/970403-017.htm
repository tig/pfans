Roy,

        If you want to make sure your bank account can retire comfortably
later, you're going have to call it back in from vacation to take care of
this little problem.  Replacing your worn motor mounts (assuming this is
your problem) is like social security for your bank account:  a few dollars
now (an ounce of prevention) can ensure a secure future later.
        The excess vibration caused by a worn mount will compromise the life
and effectiveness of a lot of components over a period of time, so it is a
good idea to have them fixed as soon as possible.  However, it should
probably be okay to drive the car for a few weeks if you're busy or having
trouble extracting the necessary productivity from your bank account.
        There are two mounts in your car, and I believe the exhaust side
(please correct me if I'm mistaken, for I honestly do not recall if this is
accurate) usually dies first.  In any case, once one goes, it puts a lot of
strain on the other one, so even if only one of your mounts is shot, REPLACE
BOTH while you're in there.  (It's like when one cooling fan motor dies- the
other will surely follow if you don't replace the dead one and take the
extra load off of the widowed one).  There is an upgraded motor mount
available for your car, that you should try and acquire if possible.  I
believe the original ones in your car are gel-filled, while the upgrades are
not(?).  I know that when I had to get mine replaced, the mechanic showed me
the old ones and all of the gel had leaked out of them!
        In any case, when I had mine done on my '86 951, the mounts were
around a little under $100 each.  I've now seen them advertised in
Excellence for $80.  I can't remember exactly, but I don't think the labor
could have been any more than 2 hours.  Anyone out there know exactly?  (I
don't have my receipts in front of me).  The point is that it's a relatively
inexpensive procedure that will help maintain the mechanical integrity of
your car and save you $$$$ from repairs later.
        Hope this helps.  GOOD LUCK!
