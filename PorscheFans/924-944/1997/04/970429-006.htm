Disclaimer:  In 1967 when I should of been sleeping through a creative
writing class, an ungrateful nation had enrolled me in upper division move,
shoot and communicate instead.  I could probably still light up a hostile
911 with a .50 caliber, but making a smooth transition to and from a
flashback in writing eludes me.   Beware, my post contains flashbacks,
neither smooth transitions nor batteries are included.



My smoke stained 951 sits dripping the remains of its unscheduled oil bath.
 A little oil, oxygen and exhaust pipe and we had P-car ignition.  I am
loading the last of my tools and gear into the back of my wife's car (yes,
Marv it is a Volvo wagon) and am telling her about my fiery spin in
animated detail.  "I spun, there was a huge flame, it was great!"  She
fixes me with her gaze, utters "your nuts" and drives off. Not totally
surprised by her reaction, I wait for the tow driver to arrive.

The master is working as usual on a Sunday afternoon when the tow driver
pulls in front of his shop.  The mystery of why his wife would leave him is
finally solved, now if we can just solve the exploding car mystery.  With
my dead Porsche unloaded and pushed onto the lift, the master launches into
his caged rat act.  He scurries about inspecting as I try to explain that I
had already jacked up the car and could not find what had blown.  His
inspection confirms my findings, our miles of stainless braided hose and
aircraft fittings connecting the accumulator, remote oil filter and oil/air
separator are not leaking nor are the OEM fittings or hoses.  The master
asks me if the engine made good power.  Great, I nearly get turned into a
crispy critter and his only concern is if the engine made good power. 
"Yes, it had a ton of power, I couldn't keep it hooked up coming out of the
corners even with the new race tires, Happy?"  My adrenaline high is
starting to wear thin.

During our marathon engine installation in the previous weeks, I began to
wonder if his constantly up mood was slightly abnormal.  As we were
finishing up late one night, he asks me if I know that there is a fine line
between genius and madness.  Well, this is a change from his usual "We have
the technology" or "Don't you know those rags cost $0.18 each".  Something
from Psychology 101 starts to stir in my murky memory, but is blotted out
by his sudden dissertation on Locktite 518.  It seems this wondrous red
urethane base sealant hardens when oxygen is removed.  Why doesn't it
harden in the tube?  You may ask this, but I certainly wouldn't.  Ask or
not, I hear all about chemical formulas and catalytic reactions.  The
master states that this is his coating of choice for the corroded ends of
the aluminum coolant lines before sliding on the rubber hoses.  Friday
night ends as I make a mental note to carry 518 on my person at all times.

Roger and Saturday arrive as a package deal.  Roger, another one of the
master's customer, acquaintance, whipping boy combinations, appears with
his car and a freshly purchased pile of parts.  Roger, an engineer who is
long on theory and short on practical application, has not purchased
exactly the right parts.  " Welcome to the club Roger, prepare for the
wrath of the master."  Roger follows the master around questioning his
every move by quoting theory.  They argue theory with the  master pointing
out that the theory Roger is quoting does not apply to the current
situation.  "Thank you Roger, I couldn't of completed this operation
without your input", rings out from the bowels of the shop.  Roger is the
subject of abuse today and  my minor screw ups go unnoticed.  Granted, I
struggle along without the master's ever present nit picking guidance but a
day of serenity is a fair trade off for limited production.  I make a point
of thanking Roger as I leave and receive a blank stare from both of them.

In the days that follow, MSD will become a four letter word.  The giga volt
ignition system is not working correctly.  After countless hours of testing
and checking, it turns out MSD has shipped the wrong ignition control
module.  It is the exact same part number as what is described in their new
catalog but is different in configuration.  A call to MSD reveals that if
the most current version is not specified when ordering, they will ship the
old outdated stock first.  The master exchanges heated words with MSD and a
duel is arranged for the next trade show.  Mega sparks at ten paces-Zap! 
MSD will probably inadvertently supply themselves a outdated unit and will
be toast.

When the MSD replacement unit fails to arrive the next day, they are again
contacted and respond with, "Oh, you asked for next day air?"  MSD is added
to my hit list.

While we await the replacement MSD unit, we inspect the engine and find
that the rubber boots on the new Nology spark plug wires are too large and
keep popping out of the sparkplug holes.  A call to the Nology customer
service desk reveals that the wicked witch of the North is no longer
unemployed.  The list grows.

As the problem list increases geometrically and our target completion dates
slip by, the master's mood starts to take a downward spiral.  The P-car is
not completed in time for the Porsche Club wine tasting expedition that I
promised I would take my wife to.  Her understanding nature has disappeared
and I find myself in deep Bandini.  This, of course, has no affect on my
cheerful attitude.  The walls of the one man shop start pressing inward. 
The master actually drops several small parts which does nothing to improve
his splendid mood, so I make a strategic retreat back to my office.  As I
vow to be more understanding to the mechanically challenged, a thought
strikes me.  An up mood could be described as manic and down could be
depressive.  Bingo!, my engine builder is a manic depressive.  The solution
is obvious, I reach for the yellow pages to find a cheap shrink and a 55
gallon drum of Prozac.  A few quick calls, a little work and the car is
ready for the next race, well almost ready.

The doctor examines the brain as Egor looks over the doctor's shoulder. 
Dr. Frankenstein diagnoses the problem as a defective injector quad driver.
 The doctor's ignition system frontal lobotomy has left few other
alternatives.  A borrowed brain is surgically inserted and the good doctor
fires up the red monster.  As the doctor comes roaring back from a 120 mph
power run, he proclaims the monster to be almost dialed in.  With a slight
grin on his face, Egor heads off with the monster.

The oil continues to drip off the undercarriage of my singed machine. 
Drip, drip, drip, just like Chinese water torture but more expensive at $4
a quart.  We will never know if it was the dripping oil or the arced
ratchet that sent the master over the edge, the mind is a mysterious thing.
