The wipers have never fully worked since I bought my 87 S. Only the last two
speeds work but they stop wherever they are as I move the switch i.e. They
never return to the bottom unless I time the switch right. The slowest speed
and the variable speed don't work. When the weather was really cold the wipers
didn't work at all! I would leave them on and as the car warmed up they would
slowly start. When this happened the slow speed would work for a while?!

Any ideas what could be the matter. I looked into the prices the switch unit
and the relay (circuit) and I would prefer to diagnose the problem instead of
just changing parts. What controls the wipers to return to the bottom when you
switch them off?

ps. I strongly recommend cleaning out the drains next to the relay box and
battery. Last weekend I heard water running behind my dash. These drains get
clogged up with leaves etc. I would imagine that the rust problem by the
battery is more because of this than battery acid.
