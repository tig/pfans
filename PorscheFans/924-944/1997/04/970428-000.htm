Hi Michael,

Good for you. You have the car, the PCA will help you enjoy it.

You really should (must) take the car to an approved tech site. All cars
in my region must have an inspection done prior to the track event. Usually
the inspection is free. Stick around while the inspection is done and ask
questions about what the inspector is doing / looking at / checking.

For a first time inspection, the earlier you do this, the better the chances
are that you can correct any problems you find. Most likely you won't have
any problems.

Enjoy,
