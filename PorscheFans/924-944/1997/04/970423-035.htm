Nick,

In a message dated 97-04-21 13:24:03 EDT, you write:

<< Anybody know of a tape with an adhesive that doesn't have this nasty
 effect, and would also cut down on having my paint job destroyed?
  >>
You might try one of the following:

     1.)  There is a strippable latex product that can be painted (brush,
roller, spray) on and later removed with little effort.  Try Phil's
Automotive Ltd., (610) 967-5754.  The military uses this stuff to cover new
aircraft prior to delivery and it can stay on for a long, LONG time and then
just stripped off.  The latex doesn't actually adhere to your paint . . . . .
it kinda sticks with surface tension like saran wrap.

     2.)  You might also try to find a product called "Nitto Tape".  It is
used by the semiconductor industry to protect silicon wafers.  It comes in
various thicknesses (some are undoubtedly thick enough to protect against
rocks) and it also uses a type of adhesion that can be pretty aggressive but
leaves no material on the surface when stripped off.  This is also used to
protect stuff like plexiglass so it can be cut without damaging the polished
surfaces.

Sorry this took so long,
