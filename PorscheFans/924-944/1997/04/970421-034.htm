In a message dated 97-04-21 13:22:31 EDT, you write:

<< I've noticed that track tires throw a lot of grit and rocks into the paint
 on the lower half of the doors, particularly if you increase wheel width in
 the front.  I got some 20 mil M3 corrosion protection tape that would seem
 ideal for using at track events,  However, after testing it on a  small
 area on the door, I found that it can strip off the clear coat finish,
 leaving your Porsche looking like it's got leprosy.  
 
 Anybody know of a tape with an adhesive that doesn't have this nasty
 effect, and would also cut down on having my paint job destroyed?

Hi Nick, a good thing to try is use good quality body shop type masking tape
it comes in widths up to 3inches so you could use it the same way.  Another
good thing to do is to put car wax on before the tape or stickers, then do
not
buff it off - just tape or decal on top of it. Then the tape or sticker is
easier to
get off, but should stay on for a race or track event.
