Carl,

A shop will probably do anything you are willing to pay them to do :-). 
My suggestion would be to go to a couple and talk to them about it.  Your
dealership or your insurance company agent might be able to refer you
to someone who routinely does Porsches.  The problem with repainting
portions of the car at its age (mine also has 150K on it) is blending the
newer, unfaded, unaged paint into the older.  I had a ding in my
quarterpanel which they feathered nicely into the color of the side of the
car,  but then we realized that the rear and side did not quite match,
because the front on the dinged side must have been repainted at some
point and the color we were matching (the dinged side) was not quite
the same as the rest of the original paint.  We found places to "break" the
new paint so the difference is not really visible unless you are looking for
it, but *I* know its there.  Anyway, FWIW and good luck!--James
