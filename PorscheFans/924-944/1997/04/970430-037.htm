I just did that seal job about 6 mos ago on my 83, 944.  No special nothing
is needed except......be careful pulling the old seal off the sunroof.  Also,
the seal comes longer than needed, so you will have to trim the seal after
its almost fully installed.

what turned out to be so easy for me, turned into a nightmare.

Porsche changed the seals rubber composition from a hard solid rubber seal to
a ballon type rubber seal.  result was my sunroof never quite seal properly.
 No water leakage, but air whistles like never before.

Also, would you believe Porsche sent there engineer troubleshooter in an
experimental yellow 911 TO MY HOUSE to look at the seal problem.

Turns out Posrsche had 3 different seals for my car - and they are all secret
and not published anywhere.

I love Porsche even though my beauty wistles.  But you cant say I didnt try,
or Porsche for that matter.
