Well I didn't think it would happen to me....but

My crank shaft,
bolt
is

STUCK

I broke my breaker bar last night trying to get it off.  (well, it was a small
breaker bar 3/8, the connection broke off)

Funny, I didn't have a problem getting it off last time, maybe I'm a victim of
over tightening the bolt?

Anyway, this has been discussed before, I realize I can heat up the bolt to
remove it, but how?  Will a simply propane torch do?  Will this adversely
affect the timing belt?

Or can I keep trying to force the bolt off.  I don't think any wd-40 is going
to help because the bolt is holds a small bell housing that holds the pump
pulleys on.

Any help is welcome!!!!

THanks!
