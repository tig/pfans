Here are a few tips based on my 944 experience:

1. Ask about maintenance records, and ask if the following have been done:
        Replace water pump with rebuilt new design, and when.
        Engine belts replaced, and when (they need to be done every 30k miles).
        Motor mounts replaced, with what design (there are two updates, the
last         one is best) and when.
        Half-shafts (rear axles) lubed and turned end-for-end? When?
        Oil cooler rebuilt and systems flushed out. When?

2. Check for evidence of leaks around the rear hatch. The spoiler/glass seal
can fail, and the water comes in there, not through the hatch-to-body seal.
Also, check under the car for evidence of fresh oil on the bottoms of the
engine and transmission.

3. Is the car lowered? If so, have the front ball joints checked closely.
They will eventually fail on a lowered car, possibly catastrophically. If
you intend to join PCA and go to driver's ed programs, lowering is not
allowed unless the front A-arms are replaced with racing units. This applies
to ALL 944s.

4. Has the car been "chipped" for higher performance? (This means replacing
the engine management sfotware with a new PROM chip with different
software.) If so, when, and how many miles or track events has it run? The
higher rev limits of chipped cars lead to inadequate high-speed oiling in
the #3 cylinder, and reduced engine life.

5. Check for buildup of dirt and grime on the inner edge of all wheelwells,
especially over the top of the wheel. This can lead to trapped moisture and
rust, even on galvanized panels.

6. If you're really attracted to a particular car, arrange to have it
inspected by a very good independent mechanic. You can find one by
contacting your local Porsche Club of America region and asking who they
hold in high regard. The cost will be around $100 if you include a
compression and leakdown test, and the owner should be willing to split the
estimated cost with you. BE THERE when the mechanic inspects it, and take
notes on what he finds. 

7. Once you buy the car, do the following immediately, regardless of
inspection findings:
        Replace all engine belts
        Change the oil
        Flush the brake/clutch hydraulic system with new fluid
        Change the transmission oil
        Flush the radiator and install new coolant

Good luck with your search. I've got an '85 Series I 944 with 82k miles that
will be for sale as soon as I find an acceptable Carrera/Carrera 2 Targa.
