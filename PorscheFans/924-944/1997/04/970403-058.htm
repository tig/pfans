That was not me, however:

There are a number of things that can cause this problem.

First, it could be the radio.

Second, the AM reception is the first thing to suffer when the antenna is
not working correctly (ie., bad grounds, defective antenna lead, defective
antenna).  FM will deteriorate, but not as much as AM does.

Third, most radios have an adjustment capacitor to tune the antenna to the
radio, and that may be out of adjustment (see radio user manual).

Fourth, I think there is an antenna signal booster amp between the antenna
and radio that may be malfunctioning (check all connections or substitute a
known working unit, or bypass the booster to test (if FM does not get
worse, it very may well be the booster (see number five below))).  Booster
amp needs 12 volts too.

Fifth, try getting a standard auto whip antenna and connect the lead to the
radio.  Ground the base of the antenna to the car chassis (door pillar
latches can make a good ground, you may need an extension lead to keep the
whip as high as possible).  The ground in the antenna lead does not count!
Once connected try the radio.  If it works, then your antenna is the
problem.  If not, then the radio is suspect.

Marv

Post Script:
If you need an extension lead to bypass the booster, Radio Shack has them.
Any auto store will carry the antennas.

Hi P-Fans,

could please someone send me the 924-944 digests from march 23rd until
april 2nd by **E-Mail** (perhaps zip-archive)?

I tried the www.porschefans.com message archive directly
 - without success. Didn't get one complete digest over the ocean...


Thanks in advance,
	Günter (expecting megabytes of good stuff... ;-)
