Mike,

I pulled the cooler apart per your directions, and it went fairly
smoothly thanks to your instructions! I had to do everything just as you
said to make it work. Imagine! Thanks.

Per our original discussion as to the source of the water, I talked to a
buddy of mine who is a VERY talented Porsche mechanic turned Fireman (
the money is better as a Fireman ). After describing all the symptoms we
discussed, his diagnosis, like yours, is that the head gasket is
leaking. Apparently there is an oil and a water passage located
extremely close to one another as they go thru the head gasket and are
prone to leakage. They would not affect compression, hence the 150#
readings I obtained, but will allow water to leak into the oil in the
volume I've experienced. He says it is a design flaw that Porsche is
aware of and there is a modified, slightly thicker gasket available to
address the problem. He says he had to change a few while working for a
dealership because of the problem.

He suggested I try re-torqueing the head after I repair the cooler to
see if that stops the leak. If not, we'll have to change the gasket. He
did make one comment that I thought was interesting when I asked him
about the rod bearings though. He said he had seen several cars with
water in the oil run for longer distances with no adverse affects on the
bearings. "Porsche tends to overreact to a problem like this to make
sure they protect against the sue-happy owners." 

If this guy wasn't a guy I might marry him just to have that knowlege
around when I need it. 

Thanks again.

John
