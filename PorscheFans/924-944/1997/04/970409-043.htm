Hi PorscheFans:

I recently took my 924S back into the local tire dealership which had
installed 4 studded snow tires onto my 15x7 phone dials last fall. In
the process of removing the rims, they stripped out the locking lug nut
"key" for the Porsche (not after-market) locking lug nuts.  There were
two (2) rims left on the car. They had two men, one on each side of a
star wrench, one pushing and one pulling just before stripping out the
lug nut "key" since the impact gun couldn't remove the lug nut even
before the key stripped.

They then drilled through the two remaining locking nuts, both wheel
studs and into the lug nut seating area of both rims. They also tried to
pry off the lug nuts and thoroughly marred the face and inset area of
the rim where the lug nut meets the wheel stud (very visible),
cosmetically ruining both rims.

The shop is denying any responsibility for damages (2 rims, 1 locking
nut set, and replacement of the 2 studs) since they claim that "I am at
fault" for having locking alloy wheel nuts on the car. They were able to
remove the "regular" wheel nuts without incident. They also add that
there is some chemical process involved between alloy nuts and steel
wheel studs which in effect "welds" the two unlike materials together.
The manager claims this is quite common and known among industry
professionals.  It had nothing to do with over-tightening the lug nuts.=20
>From this:

#1)  Have any of you heard of a "reaction" between alloy and steel
materials which creates such a bond?

#2)  Are alloy lug nuts as strong as steel, or even stronger? Would they
tend to strip out before a steel lug nut would?  I always thought allow
was stronger than steel, thus the higher prices we pay for the
materials?

#3)  Would a situation like this "normally" be considered "consumers
risk", or should the tire shop have known better than to torque down
alloy nuts in the first place, and then ruin both rims trying to get
them off the car without ever speaking to me during the process?

I'm a student so having to maintain the car is tough enough right now,
let alone having to pay for damages too. I'm trying to be fair with the
shop, but it doesn't seem right that I had a "factory" product (locking
wheel nuts) on the car and they claim it=92s against the industry norm.=20
Any comments, including suggestions of where to gain additional
information would be greatly appreciated.
