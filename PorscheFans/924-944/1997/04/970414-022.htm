The gear that operate the arms are driven by the cable itself.  You need to carefully and partially remove the sunroof seal that holds the headliner in place around the points where teh arms are located (rear of the sunroof).  Then remove the 5 screws that fasten the gearbox's lid to the box.  In there you will see where the arm engages the plastic gear.  Remove the arm and re-install so that both arms extend or retract in a similar fashion.  Make sure that the reason the arms do not extend to a different length is not due to missing teeth in the plastic gear.

When I replaced both of my plastic gears, I installed the arms so that in the extended position, the little hole in the arm (you will see it when you take the gearbox apart) lines up with the axis around which the plastic gear rotates.  With this installation, the microswitches get appropriately triggered both when the roof is fully raised and when it is fully lowered.  YMMV.

Good luck.
