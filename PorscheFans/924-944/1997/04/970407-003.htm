     Hi Brendan and List!
     
     I've owned two 924's, a 1977 and a 1978. The 924 was originally a 
     design effort under contract to Volkswagen/Audi in the early/mid 
     seventies. Volkwagen at the time had a change of leadership, and 
     Porsche needed to boost their cash flow, so Stuttgart bought the 
     design back from Wolfsburg. This is why many Porsche "die-hards" frown 
     on the 924, calling it all sorts of nasty things. But I liked mine.
     They're great fun to drive, as long as you don't try to commute in 
     traffic with one. They overheat in constant stop and go. Especially 
     the turbo's.
     
     The motor is based on the Audi 100 2.0. It uses a Porsche cross-flow 
     head, mechanical fuel injection, and a Hall effect ignition. The early 
     ones do not have an O2 sensor. The biggest drawback to the design is 
     the camshaft system. It's heavy components prevent building the engine 
     to high RPMs, which limits its performance potential. 
     
     The transmissions were primarily from the Audi parts collection as 
     well. I don't know very much about the automatic, though. Not too many 
     of them sold, I believe, so it may be interesting from a collecting 
     standpoint, although the rest of the car may not warrant that.
     
     Note that automatics are not nearly as involving as a manual to drive, 
     and if you don't want to get involved with the car, what are you 
     looking at Porsches for, after all??
     
     The front A-arms are from the Golf. The rear suspension/brakes are 
     from the Super Beetle. No, the bolt patterns/wheel backspacing don't 
     match. The braking system is a hybrid front/rear, which means discs up 
     front and drums in the back. These actually work very well, as these 
     are light cars, and limited in their overall speed by the motor.
     
     I had great fun in mine, but spent quite a bit of time in repeated and 
     annoying repairs. The electrical systems can difficult to 
     troubleshoot, and the cars have a reputation for grounding problems.
     
     I did put 36,000 miles on the '78 in one year, though.
     
     If it's in great shape, and has been well maintained, go for it. If it 
     looks like it needs some help, save your money for a good early 944. 
     Really.
     
     I have a 1987 944 Turbo now. See what happens when you get started ??
     
     Good luck, and whatever you get, make sure it's a Porsche.
     
     Yours in the Stuttgart spirit,
     
     Russell Therrien
