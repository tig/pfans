Hi Porsche Fans,
        If you have had your original compressor replaced with the less
  expensive rotary compressor, like I did, please note the following.
  Remove the lower gravel shield and check to make sure that the lower
  rear mounting ear on the Sanden compressor has been filed or cut down.
  If it has not, it will or it is already grinding away at your front
stabilizer bar,
  just like mine was (about 1/32" interference). 
        This rear lower mounting ear is not being and can easily be cut off
with
  a hacksaw while the compressor is still mounted in the car and allow plenty

  of clearance (1/4") from the stabilizer.  
  I'm not sure which cars will have the same interference problem but mine is
an
  1986  944na.
   Please check this out if you have had your compressor replaced with
anything 
   other than original equipment.
   Mike
   1986 Guards Red 944
