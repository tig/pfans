My '89 came with the Blaupunkt Reno SQR46 as standard equipment.  If you
do not have this model, you might hunt around or post here for a used one. 
This is an excellent unit, with an unsurpassed tuner section.  The
cassette section is pretty good, with Dolby B and C noise reduction and a
solenoid 'soft touch' transport.  You can do better with a top of the line
aftermarket unit such as a Nakamichi (the best) or Alpine.

Everything just plugs in, as expected.  Crutchfield and some stereo shops
sell adaptors to let you plug an aftermarket unit into the Porsche wiring
harness, should you choose.  It is a simple matter to attach the wires
from the head unit to the adapter, then just plug in. 

I would have kept my Reno installed, but I wanted to play CD's.

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L with Blaupunkt Ventura CD83.
