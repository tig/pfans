I just went to Home Depot and found a sign (like "No Smoking") made of
aluminum. I don't know how thick it is, but it's fairly thin. I then
snipped out a piece the length of which that is about the depth of the
brake pad and the width of which is slightly less than the thickness of the
pad and backing. (It's about 2" x 1/2").

To install: When looking at the caliper, there is a cross shaped wire
retainer which is released by grasping the center of the cross with pliers
and slipping the wire out of the upper retainer. This gives you access to
the pads. Remove the pads. The shims go under the pads. If they won't fit,
try thinner guage aluminum. If the pads still rattle, add more shims. The
aluminum will not scratch the rotors, but make sure you use aluminum!

Mike
