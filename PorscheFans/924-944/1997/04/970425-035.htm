I read with interest some of the answers about your oil leak.  One mans
writes about your oil cooler housing not being the problem, because it
will leak coolant--not oil.  What he does, evidently not realize, is
that the lower part of the housing is where the oil pressure relef valve
is located. This is undernaeth the water filled reservoir for the oil
cooler, and indeed, oil can leak from the seal.  If it is the old style
and has never been changed (separate seals), then it definitely is a
candidate for replacement.  If it is the newer one piece style, it also
can leak oil, even if the water portion is still intact.  It is a
difficult leak to spot, because it is very hard to see.  If you clean
everything well with Brakleen and shine a strong pencil light on the
housing, you can make out the leak as it dribbles down the case.  Of
course, there are other places for oil to leak on that side, but I think
that those  problems have been addressed for you.

Good luck...Don Istook
