        My 87 944S has begun to lose its ability to maintain idle speed. The
problem is intermittent, but frequent and seems to become worse as the day
goes on (I drive all day).  Particularly upon deceleration, the car
threatens at times to stall, with the tach diving to the bottom before
usually catching. Particularly upon coming off the interstate after higher
speed driving, a stall will occur.  Startup is fine, though.  Immediately
upon engaging the clutch in first the car tends to bog requiring more
throttle than seems necessary.  
        I have played with the set screw on the throttle assembly, but this
offers no real solution.  It seems to me the last time this happened the
dealer was able to "adjust" it without great expense or new parts. Haynes
speaks of this as a mystical "do not attempt yourself" procedure.  I suspect
I need an idle speed stabilizer. Very little is apparently known of this
product except that it lies somewhere beneath the intake manifold.  I have
also been told it could be the "computer."  
        My idea would be to replace the idle speed stabilizer ($130 from
Vertex in Miami).  How is this done? I seem to remember some mention of it
being accessible from underneath.  All advice welcome
