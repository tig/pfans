Yes there is. Usually, a motorcycle helmet is heavier. While this may
sound like a feature, it is not so. The heavier helmet puts greater
stress on the head in situations where the head isn't actually banging
into something - like when collision impact is taken up by the safety
harness.   

The typical serious motorcycle accident often means that the driver not
stops very suddenly, but is hurled to the ground and whirled around
several times before coming to rest. This is the situation where a full
facial protecting, heavy helmet is at its best.

Therefore it makes sense to differ between car helmets and motorcycle
helmets. While almost any helmet is much better than no helmet, the
proper type has clear benefits.

If you are driving a open car, you may want a integral type helmet for
comfort reasons. The same comfort reasons may call for a lighter helmet
in a coupe. The open helmet gives you a little better side vision too -
wich may be a safety issue for some. The integral is heavier, but it
will cover your mouth better - while not necessarily a big safety issue,
it may let you smile a little easier after a shunt. Also, if you want to
utilize safety equipment like full nomex clothing and emergency self
contained air supply, the integral may be your choice - but we are way
off the typical drivers ed requirements now...   

Wichever type you pick, make sure it is as new as possible. Helmets are
markeed with year of manufacturing. Plastic is subject to aging, and
older helmets are not built with the latest methods and materials
either. Take very good care of your new quality helmet. Do *not* handle
it roughly, because it will crack if it is dropped - no joke. The helmet
is supposed to be your brains 'crumpling zone' - and will not protect
the head to its maximum capacity if that clever shell construction is
destroyed. 

Best luck - may you never really need it!
