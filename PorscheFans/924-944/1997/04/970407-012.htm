I have the so-called "official" Porsche portable compressor which runs off
the lighter.  I was absolutely ripped-off when I bought mine becuase I got
it from a Porsche Design boutique in LA several years ago--the durn thing
cost $90.  I think you can get them for much less now--at least half that
if lower.  I liked the compressor becuase it had all the Porsche stickers
on it and said "Porsche" on the top cover.  The whole compressor fits very
neatly into the rear cubbyholes and never bangs around.  Problem was, the
two plastic fasteners which hold the thing closed snapped off almost
immediately, so now I need to tie the thing closed with a bungee cord.
Also, the air gauge is woefully inaccurate.  I always carry a small VDO
tire gauge in the glovebox.  I use the compressor for air but use the
handheld gauge to check the pressure.  I works pretty well.  The compressor
was able to completely inflate a tire in, oh, about ten to fifteen minutes,
which is nothing compared to a gas station, of course, but it will get you
out of a jam if you need to mount the spare.  I used the compressor to
inflate the space-saver once just to practice and it took less than 5
minutes.  I've never had any problems with it (other than knowing I paid
too much and having the plastic tabs break off).  I tried the compressor on
my Alfa 164, though, and it blew the accessory fuse after about 2 minutes,
but no problems using it with the Porsche.
