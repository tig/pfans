any advice? my '89 944S2 burglar alarm wouldn't shut up once i opened the
door with the key as of a few days ago. Even when the lock is opened, the
alarm starts as soon as the doors are opened. To quiet it, i unplugged the
battery. 

Then I removed the 2 SEND wires from the blue burglar brain in the 
footwell, so now the car is drivable, but i have no alarm. (note: 
removing the relay #18 seemed to do nothing.)

question: why does my alarm think that the car is being burgled?


please reply directly to me as the digest (which i get) is mucho screwed up.
