Blinker fluid?  Is that like "muffler bearing"?  While I realize that this
is most likely a joke post (being April first and all), I will nonethless
respond.

I'd find a new mechanic since this one sounds like he's taking you for a
ride and insulting you on top of it all.  There's no such thing as "blinker
fluid".  If your turn signals aren't working, the first thing to check is
the connection points inside the steering column.  When you push the
indicator stalk, it makes electrical connections which start a blinker
*relay*.  What usually happens is that either the relay goes bad or the
connections collect all sorts of dust and debris over time.  With a rag
underneath (so as not to drip on your carpet), I would first start by
squirting some WD-40 in around the connections and then working the
indicator arm until it works smoothly.

If this IS a joke, well. just ignore this response.
