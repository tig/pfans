Hi everybody,

a couple weeks ago my car died while i was taking a turn at high
speeds, many of you wrote back suggesting its a fuel pressure
problem...

since then the car died twice more. both at idle though. would this
suggest a fuel pump rather than the pressure regulator? I don't have
the money right now to go out and buy parts to narrow the problem
down...

After it died both times at idle, it did start right back up. I also
have a minor idle problem with cold starting, not really cold, i live
in texas, but in the morning when i first start it, there are problems
with the idle.

Any help at all is greatly appreciated!

thank you,

kevin
