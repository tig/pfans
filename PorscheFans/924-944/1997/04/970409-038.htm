I run S-02's on my 951... awesome tires.  Very sticky in the dry,
nothing else comes close in the wet.  cornering speeds average around
75-80% of dry cornering speeds in the wet, depending how much balls you
have...hehe.

My original tire size was 225/40-18 front and 265/35-18 rears, but found
tons of understeer.  Now I run 235/40-18 fronts and it's a lot better,
but when all 4 tires are new, a bit of understeer, and after the rears
"break in" (after numerous 5500rpm drops) become more neutral.

Wear on them aren't as bad as I thought, comparable to SP8000's and
better than P-Zeros.

Oh, and if anyone plans to run my tire sizes, make sure they either have
a Turbo S or shave the inside fender wall, or else you'll rub.  And make
sure you have pretty stiff suspension, and no lowering.  (turbo s and 89
turbos have inside fenderwall shaved from the factory)
