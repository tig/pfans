My 79 924 also has 110 hp according to orig. owners manual. Haynes
repair manual says '76-'77.5 = 95.4(!)hp, '77.5-'79 110hp, '80 on =
115hp(all US market cars - '80 on is Haynes phrase & does NOT include
the late '80's 924S, which is pure 944 mechanicals hiding in 924 skin!).
As for replacement parts, Porsche vs VW = no diff. in quality - if you
look closely at many of the orig. parts on the car you'll see the VW
emblem stamped into the metal or molded into the plastic! Just remember,
in some instances 'the whole is *greater* than the sum of its parts'
(i.e. these are great little cars, just like any other Porsche). 
PPE = Porsche Parts Express = savings to the customer - at least that's
what Porsche says(all standard disclaimers apply, etc.,etc.). This is
supposed to be a pricing realignment by Porsche to increase replacement
part sales by being competetive with the mail order houses like Auto
Atlanta, Tweeks, Perf. Prod., etc. I don't have an extensive knowledge
of this, but my alternator mounts were marginally cheaper at the dealer
than either Automotion or Perf. Prod.  My urge to save a buck always
seems to compell me to call every possible parts supplier to check on
the price of every little dohickey anyways, so whoever's the least
expensive wins my business.

When it comes to 924 vs 944 for maint. & repl. parts costs the 924
appears to me to be a clear cut winner. My water pump cost $38 + tax &
it was a DIY project that took I evening(okay, okay it was two eves. but
I spent half the time cleaning & checking unrelated stuff - honest!).
Most of my opinion comes from leafing thru the parts catalogs &
comparing prices. Obviously, there's a SLIGHT, almost imperceptible
trade-off in perfomance & pizazz(style, chick magnetism, ad infinitum).
Oh, I almost forgot to ask(trivia buffs to the fore), which of the two
has the lower coefficient of drag??? 

All joking aside, I got my 924 when I couldn't find a decent example of
a 944 for a reasonable price. After searching the want ads all spring &
summer long & becoming increasingly desparate for a Porsche, I 'settled'
for a "poor man's Porsche" & am enjoying it immensely! Yes, I still
dream about 944's & 911's(& 356's & 986's[Boxster]), but at least I've
got a Porsche & in the meantime I'm learning a lot about all the models
& hope to be a little more informed when I do purchase another Porsche.
