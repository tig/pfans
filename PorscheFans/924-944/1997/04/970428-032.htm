My 87 944 turbo has had the early and late Autothority chips.  They add
obvious power and torque.  And they definitely change the feel of the
engine.  The later chips in particular seemed more aggressive.

The car now has the Autothority mass-flow conversion with 310 dyno'd HP (my
car was the prototype and tuning car, so those charts they publish were
from my car with 90,000 miles on it at the time...)   As I recall, the
larger-turbo cars like yours started a 330 HP.

I really like the mass flow conversion as it makes the car seem much less
peaky and more like a highly-modified normally-aspirated engine (insofar as
the torque and power curves are concerned).

I don't have experience with Weltmeister but the seem to be reputable.  My
experience with Superchips is that I wouldn't put one on my
car...especially a car like the 951.
