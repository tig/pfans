How it works:
If the surface tension of the cooling media is lowered (for any given
coolant fluid) the cooling effect is going to be (slightly) better. This
has to do with the ability of the coolant to adhere to the hot metal and
to make it easier for the heat transfer to take place - both when
storing the heat in the engine, and when offloading the heat in the
radiator. 

This is a (much simplified) background to why a surface tension lowering
additive can be of value for lowering engine temperatures.

Something to consider:
What may not be told by anyone offering a coolant additive of this kind,
is that alcohol is more or less doing the same thing, and coolant
additives of that kind ('glycol') is universally used these days, for
both freezing and corrosion protection. So the added value of a bottle
of 'Water Wetter' may be slight, if not completely negligent.

The backside of 'glycol'-types of coolant additives is that they make
the water less effective for moving heat. Water is strange, as fluids
go, it can store a larger amount of energy (heat) before temperatures
rise than most other fluids. 
Adding a 30-40 percentage of anti-freeze is therefore going to make the
fluid (water+antifreeze) worse for heat transfer. 

If you are running a water only coolant mix, the advantage of 'Water
Wetter' type additives will be only slight. If you are already using
anti-freeze, there will be no big difference to the cooling properties.
You will want to use antifreeze, because it also stops corrosion - I
don't know if 'Water Wetter' claims to do that.

I dont want to spoil yor fun, but a clean and properly working cooling
system will probably not give you any problems with overheating.  
 

Good luck!
