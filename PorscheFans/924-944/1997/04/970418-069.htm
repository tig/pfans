Could be a bunch of things.  Based on recent experience and advice, I'd
guess your fuel pump is leaking or you're losing fuel pressure somewhere
else along the line.

Of course, I replaced my fuel pump and all the fuel lines and I *still*
have this problem occasionally, so your guess is really as good as mine.
This seems to be the Hard Starting Problem From Hell, to accompany Jay's
Cooling PFH.

Will the car start if you crank it long enough?  If you push-start it?
How long does it have to sit before it'll start normally (or
semi-normally) again?
