I'm pleased to report that my '83 944 does not use blinker fluid. I
think that mod started at the same time as the power sunroofs. My '83
uses pneumatic blinkers, driven by engine vacuum, much the same as my
wipers. The blinker vacuum reservoir is immediately forward of the
battery. You need to make sure the vacuum hose is connected to the
reservoir, or the blinkers won't have enough pressure to work.

BTW, on my 928S the blinkers are driven by the Auxiliary Power Unit
located just abeam the fuel tank. If you're looking for parts, it's the
same APU which is used by Saudi export-approved F-16s (C model or
higher). Make sure you service the turbine blades on this puppy
regularly... a cracked blade will shear off, penetrate the main drive
shielding, breach the core and lead to catastrophic depletion of the
dilithium crystals.
