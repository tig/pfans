Hello, 
	I'm new to the list and I wish I'd come here sooner!  The amount of good
information to be found here is astounding.
	I have an 85.5 944 which is in pretty good condition overall, but the rear
window squeaks like a sonofabitch, and it appears that the top of the glass
has actually pulled away from its frame - towards the back of the car.  I'm
nervous that a good bump or set of railroad tracks will sent the thing
flying out of the car, and I know how expensive the rear windshield is on
this car.  Is this a common problem, and if anyone has experience with it,
what needs to be done to fix it, and how much is it gonna cost?
	Second, I have seen a 944 around town with a glass sunroof.  My sunroof
panel has some major paint chips in it, and I like the look of the glass
one, but I haven't been able to find one anywhere.  I'll chase this guy
down and ask him where he got it, but I thought I'd check here first to see
if anybody knew about this glass sunroof panel.

Thanks in advance,

James Pratt
