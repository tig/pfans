One of the odd things about this:

When Porsche made its 924S (a 944 in 924 clothes) it was originally
found faster than the 944 with the same engine. Drag coefficient for the
944 was measured slightly better (lower), but the 924's frontal area was
less - and hence a lower *total* drag was achieved for the 924S. As wind
resistance (drag) is by far the largest speed inhibiting force acting on
an automobile at 120+ mph (200+ kmph) (its force is squared) this effect
was ofcourse troublesome. Alas, the Porsche techies changed the engine
ignition/fuel map in the brain box, so the 924S would have slightly less
power - and not be able to outrun its big brother - at least in speed
tests performed by the auto press.             

A for HP ratings, bear in mind that the multitude of versions for
different markets have resulted in a number of versions. Swedish and
Swiss versions are different from the rest of Europe, US models are
different from all European, US versions differ between year and state,
and so on. It wasn't until the advent of a 'dial-in-power', aka 'Turbo',
that Porsche was able to deliver the same power to all its versions of
944 - all over the civilized (=Porsche-driving) world.

At least, this is what the legend says...
