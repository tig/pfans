I thought I should give a reference time to our runs:  Bill Buetow (S2) ran
(I think) 48.8 and Glen Hernandez (924S) ran a 50.0.  I'm sure Bill will
correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm closing the gap slowly, but not by enough.

I'll be there one day Bill, knocking on the door.  I want to be within
3 seconds by the end of this season, consistently.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that discipline was what I
was lacking yesterday.  I was too caught up in getting a fast time that
I didn't spend enough time looking at the line and when I went out there,
I was yearning for that straight section to get on boost, and when it did
come in, about 2 seconds too late, I ended up missing my braking points
twice on the run, the first time not too badly, the second time right
before the right hander 90 degree turn at the end which did cost me
a bunch of time.

Farzaan.
Boost and discipline don't mix together.
