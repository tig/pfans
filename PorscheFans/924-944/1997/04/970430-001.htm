U bet it's a good price.  I wouldn't sell mine for that with 80K miles. 
The car is a wolf in sheep clothing.

Yes, all US '89 944 Turbo cars were S's w/247hp.  Some '88s were S's but
most were non-S w/217hp.  The differences between the S and non-S cars is
much more than just 30 hp.  The list is extensive, from brakes to
shot-peened transaxle gears.................

Driving an S-Turbo is a major kick in the pants, your 911 will seem like a
tonka-toy.  Remember that it is a Porsche, so by definition, at any
point-in-time it could rear it's ugly head and cost U mega-bucks.  Not
unlike a beautiful female, nice to look at and drive but tough to own. 
Good luck!!!!
