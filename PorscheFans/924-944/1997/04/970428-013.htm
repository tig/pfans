Porsche does not mess around... if the car gets about 1/2 way between the
dipstick marks, the light goes off... at least on my 1987 944... I think
they just want you to have plenty of oil in the car... if I start the car,
drive a short distance, turn it off, do something that takes 3 minutes (ATM
machine, quick mart...) and come back out and start it, that damn light
will often come on since oil is all over the top inside the engine... the
sensor reads low until restarted after the oil settles back down...

Do others have this experience? it's annoying... I kinda wish I could
disable that and that stupid CASIS shift light...

Hey, at least we don't have that terrible BMW trip computer... I loved BMW
535 and 540 cars until my friend bought one... half of the dashboard and
center console is taken up by a computer that tells you all kinds of
information you can live without... I expect that from Chrysler, but not
the Germans... the only half decent info it gives is the outside
temperature, and I'm cool with sticking my hand out the window for that
"data"...
