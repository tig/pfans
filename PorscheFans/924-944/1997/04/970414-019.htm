Hello P-fans

I have a couple of questions about my 85.5 944.  I have recently been under
the dash rebuilding wiring harness and running wires where previous ones
burnt.  I do not know what caused the problem and unfortunatly i am working
without the back-ordered manuals so im in the dark about some things.

As far as i know, there was a single wire which burnt from the relay board
to the alarm (control box?) under the passenger side dash next to the DME. 
As this wire burnt, it took others along with it - all of which i have
traced and replaced.  

Some symptoms...
When I turn the ignition on - switches and instruments and dash lights
work, gagues do not.  
Turn the key over - sounds like fuel pump is running and a small electrical
click under the dash - but no turn of the starter.

Some questions 
Is it possible to check relays?  the cooling fan relay smells like it might
be bad and shows a hot point on a connection.  Would any other relays
prevent the engine from turning over while everything else seems to work?

I understand that the alarm unit could be bad, but this should only prevent
fuel pump from running and not the starter, right?

I understand that the DME could possibly have burnt.  Would this prevent
the starter from turning over, or just prevent spark and fuel injection?  I
have contacted Porsche and found that there is no way to test the    DME so
i am reluctant to purchase a new one before I exhaust every other
possibilitiy.

The shops around my area are reluctant to help so I would appreciate any
advice!
Thanks in advance
