Mike,

No, it's too much water, ( approx. 2 quarts ) for it to be condensation.
I haven't noticed any oil in the coolant, but I have noticed that I
would lose a small amount of coolant on a routine basis, approx. 1 quart
after I put 400 or so miles on the car. I was just about ready to check
the cooler anyway. It might help if you knew some of the other stuff.

I just ran a compression check, and all 4 cyl. were 140-150# (cold
engine of course), no white smoke when I started it (steam), or
knocking, etc. that might indicate head/gasket problems anytime in the
recent two weeks prior to this problem, (other than the slight coolant
loss noted), so I don't think it's that type of problem. Short of
replacing the oil cooler gaskets and running a pressure check on the
cooling system, I don't know of anyway to verify the location or source
of the water without teardown of the entire engine. That's what I'm
trying to avoid by asking these questions. I've got a fair background
with a wrench, but I'm unfamiliar with the inner workings of the 944. I
guess the real question is if the oil cooler CAN cause this severe a
problem. I'm guessing, but I'd assume if oil can get out under pressure
into the coolant, (60# vs. 15#), coolant could go into the oil when the
engine is hot but not running, (15# vs. 0#). If this isn't possible,
then I suppose it's time to pull the head and hope.

Thanks,

John G.
