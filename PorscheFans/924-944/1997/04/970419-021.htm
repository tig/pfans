I had some of the same symptoms on the Boost and found that the vacuum 
line at the computer under the passenger floorboard had become loose. 
 There is a copper fitting that can be tightened by hand, check that.

As for the idle, mine jumped around until I got some contact cleaner 
and sprayed the inside of the connector to the throttle position 
sensor, all is well now.

Hope that works!!!

Subject:	'89 944 S Turbo Boost Problem

I'm the original owner of a '89 944 Turbo S.  It now has 80K 
aggressively
(not destructively) driven miles.  I had the original clutch replaced 
at
79K miles.  Actually, the clutch probably would have gone longer but 
I
think the "lot boy" at the dealer did a few too many "hole shots", 
because
when I picked it up after a regular service, the clutch was out, go 
figure.
 It runs great with only one extremely annoying intermittent problem 
to
which the local dealers cannot or will not definitively propose a 
solution
without my giving them essentially a blank check -- bad idea at a 
Porsche
dealer.

The symptoms ---------------

*  Under hard acceleration the boost waffles between 1.0 and 1.7 bar. 
 This
is different than the standard over-boost condition when the 
waste-gate
cuts the boost completely to avoid real damage.  The car has done that 
from
day-one.

*  The idle will be 950 rpm and then 1500 rpm staying at one or the 
other,
unpredictably, when cold or hot.

*  Engine operating temperature tends to be at the high end of the 
scale.

Things I've tried ---------------

*  Textron additive and Octane Boosters -- some improvement, but may 
be
only in my head

*  Complete service / tune at the dealer ($$$$$) -- no change

*  Split fire spark plugs -- no change

One dealer suggested that I install an after-market chip set since 
that is
where the problem "typically" exists, and I would get more horsepower 
at
the same time.  I think I'd like to be a little more scientific about 
it,
namely identify the root cause before we start swoppin' parts.  Then, 
I'll
happily pay whatever it takes to fix the problem.

Also, I live in the mountains and typically drive at altitudes between 
5K
and 10K feet.  The car has always been driven at this altitude and 
the
problem started only a few thousand miles ago.

Please help, I love the car and don't want to trade it for a 
"rice-burner".

Thanks,
