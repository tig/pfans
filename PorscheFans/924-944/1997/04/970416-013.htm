Hey Allen, 

You need to take a poll and see if we can guess which dealership
this was!    I bet some get a lot of votes.

>Hi List,

>I stopped by the local dealer today to order a bunch of books (thanks to
>Qassim Moola's and Mike Kehr's ample guidance), and paused to inquire
>about the two Boxsters they had waiting for owner-pickup.  I expressed
>an interest in purchasing either a new Boxster or a used 911, to which
>the salesman replied "Let's talk bluntly, there are a lot of people who
>want to sit in one just for the bragging rights, but who don't really
>have any intention of buying one.  You know what I mean?  Why would you
>want to 'look it over' if you have no intention of buying it?".
>
>Well, my intent of buying one went somewhere between "out the window"
>and "Hey salesguy, you can kiss my $#@#!".  Shortly thereafter, the
>parts department was rude and unversed in what I was looking for, so I
>left and logged onto MY Porsche's web page and ordered the manuals I
>wanted from there (which was a LOT cheaper, as it turns out!).
>
>Thanks.  Just needed to vent.
