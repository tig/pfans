Sorry to waste bandwidth but seem I'm not the only one
who is having problems.

>I don't mean to complain but what has happened to the list.


>I now only get the digest once in a blue moon and when it
>comes it's all individual enclosures in one digest.  Is this the
>new and improved style or am I just messed up.  I seem to
>get the 911 list most days but not the others.  Anything we
>can do to help.  Are we just so big now that we are over
>loading the system or is this a software feature?  Sorry I need
>a good high speed fix so I'll leave now and go for a ride.
>Thanks.  Please keep the list up and running even if it is
>mixed up.  Your reward awaits you.
