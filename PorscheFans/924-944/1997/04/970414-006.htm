Included in this note are:
1) Front Bearing removal and installation, what I did
2) Replacing ball joint boots with inexpensive over the counter parts
3) rebuilding your ball joints at home with inexpensive over the counter
parts!

************************************************************************

 Thanks to everyone who sent me advice on removing and installing the
bearing races on my front hubs!! Here is what I ended up doing, worked
great:

1) Heat Hubs to 150Deg. C in Kitchen oven
2) Cut a 6" section of steel pipe, remove burr with file
3) remove hot hub #1 from oven with leather gloves, place on concrete
floor, drive old races out with steel pipe and hammer, being careful not
to scratch or otherwise ding the hub
4) place hub #1 back into oven
5) repeat 3 & 4 on hub #2
6) Trim the ends of the steel pipe to remove damage from removal process
7) Remove hub #1 from oven, clean, lubricate with tapping
fluid,carefully drive new races in
8) repeate 7 on Hub #2

All in all, took me less than an hour, removal and installation. I would
highly suggest heating these hubs.  Driving the races off the first hub
took about 5 minutes, and a bit of force.  By the time I got to the
second hub, it was a higher temp than the first, and it took me about 45
seconds!  Heating makes a big difference in the amount of force needed.
The other thing that made a big difference was working directly on the
concrete floor vs. the workbench. Even a 5/8" piece of plywood in
between the hub and floor dramatically increased the amount of hammer
velocity needed.


*** Professional Ball Joint Rebuild story, rubber boot replacement ****
 
Ok, I had sent my alloy A-Arms off to Dynamic Euro Tech. for ball joint
rebuild, $150 each. They rebuilt the Right A-Arm, but the left A-Arm had
a crack, so I decided to purchase a used A-Arm.  After calling about a
dozen places across the country, I got one from PAP for $150 (they
wanted $200).  
  I received all of these back by Last Friday. Dynamic Euro Tech did a
good job rebuilding.  They cleaned and sprayed the Arms with what looks
to be zinc, and replaced the ball joint. The rear of the ball joint
(where the old one was held in by a clip) is now sealed with some sort
of epoxy. The cracked arm looked to be cracked by excessive travel where
the ball pin hit the lip where the boot attaches, not structural, and
still usable.
  
  The used Left A-Arm from PAP was very dirty.  I cleaned it with a wire
brush, and coated it with clear chip guard(I covered the bolt holes,
bushing, and ball joint boot).  The ball joint itself was still tight,
but the boot was rotted.  I went around to local parts stores, and
compared early '85 A-Arm ball joints (the ones with three mounting bolts
for the early '85 steel A-Arms, I think these are also used on VW
rabbits) to the one on my used alloy A-Arm.  All of the ones I looked at
(and measured with my caliper) were between 0.15" and 0.20" smaller in
outer diameter where they clip to the ball joint.  I purchased one which
was 0.15" smaller ($22).  With a little stretching, the boot fits well
on my Used Alloy Arm!  I would highly suggest this to anyone with


cracked or otherwise damaged boots! (You will need to re-use the clip
which holds the rubber boot on, so be carefull not to damage it)  

  Now I had a used A-Arm for the left side of my vehicle with a new
rubber boot, and the rebuilt A-Arm for the right side, and my slighlty
cracked extra left A-arm with a missing ball joint.  So I thought,
wouldn't it be nice if I could rebuild the cracked arm with the parts
from the replacement ball joint I just took the boot from?  Well, it
wasn't that difficult, I just need a new boot for it to complete the
rebuild!  

************************Ball Joint Rebuild*******************
Here is what you will need:
o Dust Mask
o Goggles
o Dremel tool, Heavy duty cuttoff discs and mandrel (or other suitable
cutting tool)
o vise
o rubbing alcohol 
o paper towles
o exacto knife or similar
o aluminum tape (the kind used for heating ducts is fine)
o New Replacement ball joint for early '85 or older steel A-Arm
o Misc tools

1) Clamp the new ball joint in the vice, cuttoff the rear of the ball
joint assembly. This is where the housing was crimped around the steel
end plate to hold the ball joint together when manufactured.  You don't
want to damage this end plate, and you don't want to cut closer to the
ball than needed or you will damage the plastic cage.
2) Once the end cap is removed, remove the clip holding the rubber boot
to the ball joint.  Be carefull not to damage the boot!slide the boot
off.
3) press or hammer the ball joint out of the housing
4) remove the ball joint from the plastic cage, clean all parts to
remove all grease
5) carefully dissassemble the ball joint on your Alloy A-Arm.  The
assembly is held in place by a clip which is sealed with a hard caulk
like substance.
6) now examine all of the parts you have, measure and compare the old
parts to the new parts. I had the disadvantage of not having any of the
old alloy a-arm parts (Dynamic Euro did not return them, they only sent
back the alloy A-Arm).  In my case, the diameter of the hole in the
A-Arm was about 0.10 inches larger than the outer diameter of the
plastic cage.  So what to do?  
7) I carefully applied aluminum tape to the ouside of the cage (this is
one of the reasons de-greasing is important).  To do this, cut aluminum
tape strips that are a bit wider than needed. Wrap around the cage in
such a manner as to avoid any creases or air bubbles. cut slits in the
tape where the cage has them.  carefully rub the tape on with your
thumbnail.  You may need to trim the tape in the region of the slits as
you are smoothing it out.  trim any excess off.  smooth with the side of
the exacto handle.  You want to achieve a mirror smooth finish, free of
air bubbles or creases.  apply as many layers as needed, 8 in my case,
to build up to the needed diameter.  for a final layer, use some clear
packing tape, this will help the assembly slide into the hole in the
a-arm.  
8) grease and press the ball joint into the cage. Press the cage into
the A-arm.  If you built up enough tape layers, this should be a snug
fit.  
9) use your inginuity to press the end cap on, and hold it in place.  In
my case, the new end cap was the right diameter to press into smaller
diameter hole the cage fits in.  I was able to hammer it in until the
ball joint was as tight as the Dynamic Euro Rebuild.  I plan to seal
this off with epoxy.

I plan to search for more suitable replacements that are the correct
diameter. It is also possible to do something better than tape in the
above.  The challenge is filling in the gap while maintaining the
countour around the top of the cage.  Send me your suggestions.  I will
be fine tuning this procedure, and plan to eventually take pictures and
better document it. Obviously, there are no guarentees!!  Use this info
at your own Risk!!


Good Luck!
