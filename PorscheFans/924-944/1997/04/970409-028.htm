James,

        I've never seen a 4-spoke steering wheel on an '83 944.  I thought
they came with the upgraded dash in mid-1985?  In any case, Porsche tried to
improve ergonomics and aesthetics with the new dash, and the steering wheel
was not supposed to rub your thighs as much.  Perhaps the designers placed
the 4-spoke closer to the dash so that your legs might clear the wheel
easier?  I know my 951's 4-spoke seems a lot more comfortable than the
3-spoke I used to have in my '83 944.  I used to cradle that thing in my lap!

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
