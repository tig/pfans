Someone a while ago posted about racing his 924S (same body) against, I
think, a 944S or S2.  Straight the whole way, he just *barely* pulled
ahead of the 944 and stayed there.

....and the disadvantage, also from a message from here a while ago, is
that the 924 and 924S has to take smaller tires than the 944 series before
you start scraping the wells on turns.

Mmm.... turqoise.  Diamant silber, L97A, here.

And if you can't translate "diamant silber," well...

     icarus@berkshire.net	in  which the one who is catching his
