I called Zim's Porsche parts for a seal kit for my oil cooler and the
salesman asked if I had the updated housing or the original. I didn't
know that there was an update on the housing, just the seals. 

Does anyone know what he was talking about?

My son just asked me to see if anyone knows of a source for the sunroof
cable for his 84 944. His mechanism is OK, and all he needs Is a new
cable. The only source we've been able to locate is original Porsche
parts which includes the entire assembly for some $300.

Thanks
