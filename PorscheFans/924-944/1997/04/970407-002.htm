Hi  Darren,
Sounds to me like one of the micro switches at the rear of the 'track' has gone bad. It sounds like it has changed from being closed to open all the time. It is also possible that it is one of the relays that are connected to the switches but I would guess that it is the switch.
Does this happen only in key position 2? Can you fully open the roof in key position 1 now? (My guess is that nothing happens in position 1)
At least these parts are cheap!!
