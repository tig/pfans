Chris,

Thanks for the reply.  I did replace the cap, rotor, wires, plugs and
air filter along with a oil change. The wires were a embarassment! I
also traced and checked the vac lines and wires.  The car runs better
but the starting problem remains.  I also failed to mention that I put a
can of injector cleaner in a couple of days before the problem started,
can't help but wonder if some crud dislodged and is causing the problem.
  The car has 81000 miles but only about 2k in the last 2 years.  I have
put about 500 since I got it.
  Also, when the morning temp is about 30-32 deg it takes about 10 tries
before it will sustain running, but when it's 45 deg (this morn) it
caught on the first try.  In either case it still feels like only two
are firing for the first 10-15 sec. then all is fine.  There remains a
slightly rough idle which nearly disappears when warmed up.
  I am elaborating on the details I left out originally in the event
anyone can solve the mystery. (I plan on checking fuel pressures this
weekend for good measure)

Thanks Much
George Mouer
