Bob:  Here's some input I got on R1's that I haven't been able to test....I=
 =0Acall it the 4 lb. rule........Start the tires out cold at an arbitrary =
number, =0Asay 34#front, 32#rear.  Suggest higher in the front as the cars =
tend to push =0Aand higher front pressure helps.  Go out for the session, c=
heck pressures as =0Asoon as you return.  The rule claims that your ideal p=
ressure cold is one that =0Acauses the tire to reach 4# more pressure hot. =
 If you come in and the 34# =0Atire is at 44# hot, then go out the next tim=
e with the tire at 36#.  If you =0Acome in and it's 42#hot you're getting c=
loser to having a 4# differential =0Abetween hot and cold.  Go out next tim=
e at 38# and adjust accordingly. =0A =0APressures I generally run on other =
tires: =0A =0AGoodyear GSCS=0931 front   29 rear =0AHoosiers=0937         3=

the above =0Adifferences in tires due to construction and compound differen=

I will soon be taking my new-to-me '86 951 out play in the traffic for
the
first time, and am hopeful that someone can advise me on appropriate
R1 tire pressures for track events. 

I will be using unshaved 16 inch 225x50(f) & 245x45(r) R1's mounted on
Fuchs wheels.  The suspension is stock except for a front strut brace
and
is in good shape.  I would guess air temperatures will start in the high
70's
and peak in the low 90's.  Tracks will be Road Atlanta, Roebling &
Summit
Point.

I know I should have had the tires shaved, but I expected to use them at
several events in March/April which I missed.  Oops.  So now the tires
will 
probably run overly hot until I wear off some rubber.  

I read the 20-30 page memo on "care & feeding of R1's" available on the 
TireRack website, which gives generic pressure recommendations based
on car weight, but I would sure appreciate any specific 951 suggestions
anyone might have.
