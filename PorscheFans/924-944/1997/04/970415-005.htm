Waste of time.  Freon and saws can take these out in a matter of seconds,
especially if the thief chooses to cut the actual steering wheel instead of
the club.  On a special story about car theft on 20/20 or some similar news
broadcast, they asked professional thieves and ex-convicts if seeing the
club in a car discouraged them enough to try a different vehicle.  All
claimed that the club did not intimidate them in the slightest, and that
they would not avoid or hesitate to approach that car.  In fact, those cars
using the club just drew more attention to themselves because they probably
protected a valuable car with other valuables inside.

Detachable faces are effective, as long as you resist the temptation to hide
your stereo face in your car because you're lazy or whatever.  Thieves will

JUST TAKE THE DARN THING WITH YOU EVERY TIME YOU LEAVE YOUR CAR FOR MORE
THAN A FEW MINTES!
        Remember, prevention is key, but there are no foolproof alarms out
there.  So pay attention when you decide where to park your car and what
belongings you will leave exposed within it.  It doesn't matter how many
expensive features and gadgets your alarm has, a motivated thief can and
WILL steal you car if he really wants to...

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
