       As far as the differences between the two cars, the only real one as
far as performance goes is that with the S the car has more acceleration in
the mid to upper Rpm range. This car loves to be revved, like most other 16
valve engines do. Also a lot of the parts are from the 951 model. As far as
parts go the S is much costlier than a regular 944. The reason is that a
lot of after market parts suppliers don't really make parts because of the
limited number of S's produced compared to the 944. Trust me on this one !
I was looking for an after market muffler from Ansa,Borla,etc. and no one
made one for the S model. Had to get an O.E.M part which set me back about
750 bucks! Also the clutch components are exclusive to the S model I think.
I've owned both and enjoy the S much more though, just seems to have better
components standard. Plus it was made in much smaller numbers then most
other 944's.
