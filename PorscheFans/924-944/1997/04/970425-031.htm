I have had the same problem. Water enters along the top /sides and follows
the "ditch" in the middle of the figure 8 "door" seal until it reaches the
area of the "locking pins" where the inside of the figure 8 seal is
lower than the outside. This means "the inside" part of the door seal
leads the water into the trunk area. Another possibility is the two
drainage holes between spoiler and glass witch you have re-caulked, they
lead  a lot of water close to the main doorseal's weakest area.
Get some help and use a water hose on the outside while you observe on the
inside to see if the water enters trough the drainage holes or along
top/sides of the "door".
A dirty fix for the problem is to make a cut in the outer part of the
Figure 8
profile seal near the locking pin (the lowest part), after you have tested
with the water hose.  
I hope this can help you.
