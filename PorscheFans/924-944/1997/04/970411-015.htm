I am looking for some quick advice on changing the bearing races on the
front wheels.  I have removed the hubs, removed the rotors from the
hubs, de-greased the hubs, and now have to decide how to change the
races.  The shop Manual says to:
  1) heat the hub to ~120->150 Deg. C
  2) Press out the Old Races
  3) Heat it up again
  4) Press in the new races

Ok, I could heat these in the kitchen stove, but I do not have a press.

 I called around to see if any local shops would perform this service
for me.  One shop said it would take two hours, and I would be charged
accordingly. It obviously will not take two hours, I have already done
most of the work, and it should take less than an hour if heating time
is included, probably ten minutes of actual labor.  Another shop told me
it was no big deal, and they don't bother to heat the hub, just drive
the races in and out with a punch. I am not happy with either of these
responses.  Obviously the thermal coefficient of expansion is such that
heating the hub expands it more than the races, allowing for less force
to be used during removal and installation. How important is this?  Our
German engineering friends are no idiots, but were they just being
overly careful with the recommended procedure?  I am inclined to heat
these up in the kitchen stove, and use a hammer and appropriate size
punch.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
