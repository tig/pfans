my 85.5 944 has been sitting in my garage all year. it has seen one and one
helf tank of gas. probably has less than 600 miles all year, i dont know i cant
find someone to fix the odometer! i am kinda fond of the fact that it has been 
sitting and i am showing restraint, hopefully i can keep the miles down for a
good long while.  anyhow to the important stuff.
1) a while ago the belts were squealing i finally made them stop when i got new
ones and replaced the tensioner which had broken during an unfortunate accident
involving RR tracks and a 45 MPH jump! well they are up to it again only
this time i think the problem is with the PS pump, water pump or both.  when 
i was checking them the other day i found that the end of the long tensioner 
by the alternator did not have a bolt in it. i am guessing that it is about 8 inches
long but i am not sure.  Does anyone know???? i can hear the blets sagging and
i am now sure that this is the problem but i cant replace the bolts if i dont know
what size and length.

2) the amount of lifter click is unbeliveable! it was never this loud before and i mean 
you can easily hear it from the other side of the garage not a problem.  i am thinking
that i might need new lifters but i am not sure of the replacement tech.  i imagine
one would have to take the valve cover off and go from there.  is it possible that i am 
also hearing the spark plugs fire?? they need to be replaced i have just been putting
it off and since it wasnt being driven i didnt see much point.  if so what is the proper
torque setting? 

3) i bought the car sans service records so it is going to the p-car dealer in San 
Antonio to have the timing belt etc. changed. i dont think it needs new rollers but that
is really not an informed opinion. the guy said that without looking he cant tell me
what the cost would be but i am imagining that it is going to be in the 350-700 dollar
range is this an exceptable guess???  

thanks in advance
matt
