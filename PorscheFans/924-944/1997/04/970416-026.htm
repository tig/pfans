Well, I continue to become frusterated with the PO of my car (at least
the work that had been done on it.) There have been so many things that
were done incorrectly, and I am continually discovering additonal items
as I fix others.  The latest has me worried about the local auto dealer
I was going to bring my car to for an alignment. At some point, one of
the PO's had done a bad waterpump installation, and overheated the
engine.  They went to this particular dealer, and had a used engine
installed (I have the receipt). Since I just noticed that the bolts on
the engine mounts are too long, and therefor hit the rubber, I can only
assume that the dealer service dept. did this when installing the used
engine, what idiots. This is the only Porsche dealer in the area, and
all the local repair shops that claim to service Porsche autos in my
area don't do alignments. When I speak to the service dept. about doing
the alignment, they tell me that it takes ~3 hours, and they want $130. 
Ok, this isn't your average car, but 3 hours and $130?  The front End
should be a no brainer to adjust, and the only thing in the rear that I
can think of that would take a long time is if they have to remove the
spring plates to change them a notch or two on the torsion bars.  Am I
missing something? or is this place just going to take my money?  What
kind of equipment should a place need to do an alignment? 


  I have some additional time to look for an alignment shop as I am now
replacing the valve guide seals, oil cooler seals, crankcase seal, in
addition to the other items I had been working on.  Those damn rubber
seals just don't last too long.  Should have just tore the whole engine
apart when I first started. Oh Well.. Should have it back on the road
again next week.

I am located in Burlington, Vermont. ~3.5 hrs north of Boston, Mass.
