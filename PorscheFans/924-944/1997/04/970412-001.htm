Sounds vaguely like a VW/Audi code (which is what Porsche uses).  Mine is
L97A, but it seemed to be rather eccentric -- the others went by a
different standard.

I don't suppose you're that 944 owner who lives in Longmeadow?  Believe it
or not, I've seen only three 944s there -- a red one that would be pretty
if not for the automatic transmission sitting between the seats, a gold
one with a spoiler drifting around, and an unfortunately-colored one
parked in a driveway.

If you want anything of use on your Porsche, call PCNA.  I don't have the
number, but someone else on the list can supply it to you if you want it.
Give them the VIN of your car, and they can tell you the paint code (and
color, in English or German), options, date-of-manufacture if you lost
your "MANUFACTURED BY Dr. Ing. h.c. F. PORSCHE AG WEST GERMANY" sticker,
too.  I also wouldn't be too sure that LM1Y is your paint code, especially
if the dealer claims it doesn't exist.

Stop by at a local auto parts store, like Auto Palace.  They should have
books lying around with paint codes.  Check under VW/Audi for the year of
your car.  You should be able to go by descriptive color alone (i.e., not
the paint code), since there really aren't many colors.  Then, go buy
yourself a German dictionary.

Mine is easy: Diamant Silber, or Diamond Silver.

I love how I'm developing all these Porsche mantras.  "1-4-3-2."  "Dr.
Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG."  "L97A, Diamant Silber."  "Negative roll
radius."  And I've read my manual so many times that I can quote bits of
it by heart (and can do transmission conversions in my head).

(Since I can tell you're curious: 5th gear, ratio 0.600:1, axle ratio 5:1.
6500 * 60 * 2Rpi / 5 / 0.6 = top speed... about 155mph.)
