Electrical sensors have a response time which may change as they get old.
That is, all sensors require some amount of time before their readings are
accurate.  For example, imagine changing the temperature faster than a
mercury thermometer could register-- you have to let it sit for a few
minutes before the thermometer reading is accurate.  If your O2 sensor is
old, it may just be "tired" and respond too slowly to pass the test.

The engine computer can work without the O2 sensor, but not very well.
Without the O2 sensor, it runs in "open loop" mode, which means it makes
its best guess about the amount of fuel to inject based on its computer
map, the throttle position sensor, and the air flow sensor.  The O2 sensor
allows the computer to "fine tune" the amount of fuel injected into the
engine.  If your car runs too high on the CO but doesn't smoke, my guess is
the O2 sensor.  If your car smoked on deceleration, I would suspect the
throttle position sensor, false air entry, a fuel pressure regulator going
South, or a bad air flow sensor.  But that doesn't sound like what you're
describing.

As for Auto Atlanta telling you that there's no adjustment to help, I'm
surprised and somewhat disappointed since ther *is* an adjustment screw
that affects the CO levels.  Actually, there's two of them!  One screw that
could possible affect your CO setting is a 7mm bolt that sits near the
throttle body.  It's set in what looks like an epoxy resin and it changes
how much air bypasses the throttle plates.  This, combined with the
throttle plate screw, can be used to vary the CO content while keeping the
idle approximately the same.

The second screw is located on the air flow sensor and is described (with a
picture) in the book, "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management" Chapter 4,
section 7.1 (a very informative book, by the way).  The book describes this
second screw as a "mixture screw".  Turning the screw clockwise will richen
the mixture, while turning counterclockwise will lean the mixture.  That a
Porsche specialty place didn't know this is sad, but not all that
surprising.  I find that most Porsche places only really know the 911, not
the 944.

In short, my money (if I were a betting man) would be on the O2 sensor.  A
capable shop should be able to confirm this and make adjustments as
necessary.  It may just be a simple adjustment!

Let us know what you find out.
