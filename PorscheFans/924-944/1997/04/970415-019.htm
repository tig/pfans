Oh no Wes!

Sorry to hear about your car!  It seems that the best place to take your
car to for body work around here is Burrard Autostrause.  They work on
all of the Lambos, Ferraris, Porsches, etc. around here.  You should
probably ask MCL who they recommend and I know that Weissach recommends
Burrard.  ICBC (which I'll assume is your insurer) MUST allow YOU to
choose which body shop to go to.  They may try and get you to get
three estimates, don't bother.  Tell them this is your Porsche and it
will go to who YOU want it to go to, PERIOD.  If they want three estimates,
let them get it for you and then kindly reject all of them and choose
the shop you wanted in the first place.

As for parts (window, etc.), make sure that Burrard knows that you want
factory parts, not OEM, not aftermarket, but factory Porsche parts.


You pay huge insurance fees here in B.C., you at least deserve to get
the same parts that were broken/stolen back.

Paul and I went through this crap when his Talon was stolen and bumped
into all those parked cars.  It was a nightmare dealing with the
insurance company, but in the end, we stuck to our guns and got the car
fixed properly.

As George says, Good Luck!  If you need any help, give me a shout, I've
helped a bunch of people deal with the Insurance company.  ICBC can be
good to work with if you are stern and fair from square one.

Farzaan.
