Hi, Rich,

Looking at my copy of the 1984 Exterior Paint Colors pamphlet, there is
no "LM1Y" listed.  The second and fourth characters are all numbers, but
the ones starting with "L" are specific to 944s.  However, pamphlets have
been known to be wrong or it may have been a specially ordered color.
You may want to call the PCNA Customer Commitment Center at 800-545-8039
to see if they can help you.
