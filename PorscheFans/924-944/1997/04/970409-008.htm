Having recently dealt with some similar problems I'll gladly share my
findings with you:

Changing front rotors can induce two possible errors:

One is obvious, you are exposing the bearing for a lot of dirt when you
take it out, dismount the old rotor, handle it and so on. This can make
the bearing fail, as they, understandably, are sensitive to dirt. 

The other problem lies in the construction of the rotor-hub assembly.
The tiniest amount of debris, wedged between the rotor and the hub at
bolt-together time, may (will!) give the same effect as a warped
rotor.    

As you have changed rotors, there will probably not be any rust on them
in this case. But if you haven't changed the rear ones... Trust me,
there can be a tremendous amount of rust on rear brake rotors, as they
are very lightly loaded in normal driving. Rust cakes and have to be
peened off the rotor to make it even usable, and aft rotors should be
resurfaced to be perfect. This is especially easy to miss on the rear
rotors, as they rust a lot on the inboard side - at least on mine. 

Please also differentiate between the 'pulsing' pedal movement from
warping rotors, and the 'vibration' induced by stuck 'sliding calipers'
rumbling along on the edge of the rotor. Porsche still used one
cylinder, sliding calipers on 1985.5 models (4 cylinder fixed calipers,
standard on Turbo's, came later). 
Moving them around helps - especially when brake pads are out. Some
grease (*not much* - just some!) on the sliding edge will help. Observe
that only the rear caliper have plastic inserts to help with smooth
movement. They will melt (!) under racing conditions on the front
caliper ass'y (no kidding!).

In this case - I'll guess in this order:

1.  Sliding calipers not moving freely
2.  Rear hand (emergency) brake shoes displaced 
3a. Dirt between hub and rotor 
3b. Rust (if rotors are not new) 
4.  A bad front bearing (rumbles at first, if it has a lot of play may
even shift around, eventually seizes and can make the car unsteerable or
drop the wheel completely - nasty) - but you'll hear it if you turn the
wheel by hand.  
Good luck
