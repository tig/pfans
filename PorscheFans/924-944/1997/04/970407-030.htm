I have a 1987 944S. My oil pressure gauge used to act the same and I
thought it was the sending unit. I recently had an oil change at a
different shop and they used Penzoil 10/30, used to be Quaker State 10/40.
Now the pressure goes down to about 2 bar at a warm idle.

no idea

When I bought mine last summer the steering was crisper than I was used to
so I thought it was OK. The steering rack started leaking so I replaced it
and was amazed at how much crisper the steering was. It's still stiff at
very low speed though.
