Greetings all:

One item to keep in mind about detachable face stereos--it is very possible to buy a 
replacement faceplate for a detachable face stereo. They run about $50 at almost any 
stereo shop. The expensive part of a stereo is the head unit that remains in the 
car. A thief usually won't bother, but don't think a detachable face stereo is the 
holy grail against stolen car stereos.

On my last car (not a Porsche), I had installed an Eclipse CD player with the 
Eclipse Security Network. The owner of the stereo can insert his/her favorite CD 
into the unit and quickly code the unit to work after it loses the power source 
(when it is stolen, etc.) only after this "key" CD is installed. If the thief steals 
it anyway it is absolutely useless, and if he calls the 800 service number on the 
unit for help, Eclipse sends it back to the owner's address on file. An Eclipse runs 
about $450 and has a policy of replacing a stolen unit for free for 12 months after 
the date of purchase. There may be a way around this theft deterrent technology, but 
the average young punk probably doesn't know it/can't get it.

Eclipses may not fit in some cars, but they are worth looking at in terms of their 
very high quality, great performance, and top-line theft deterrence for any car you 
may be driving. Audiophile magazines rate them highly every time. Because this is 
such a unique way to prevent theft in car stereos, I thought I'd share it.

BTW, I have nothing to gain from Eclipse--I'm just a very satisfied customer. Hope 
this helps!
