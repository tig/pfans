Jerry and Michael,

Have had my '87 944T since new. The short inlet hose at the compressor 
failed at about one year and the loooong hose, (from comp up left side 
and along firewall), failed about two years ago. Both hoses failed (small 
leak) where metal was crimped to rubber. I could see oil residue at the 
crimp. Porsche dealer replaced both at no cost to me even tho latter case 
was definitely out of warranty. (Crimps are not suppossed to fail).

Last year, AC  was blowing warm air and I could see residue on one of the 
metal pipe fittings at the dryer. A AC Shop tightened the fitting and 
refilled the system with R-something that is the substitute for R-12. 
Worked fine last year and still is.

Regards,
Jim K.
