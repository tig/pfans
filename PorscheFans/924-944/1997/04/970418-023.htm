BMW radios circa 1988 feature a flashing red light that says "ANTI-THEFT"
underneath.  And a plus: most thieves think it's a car alarm, even though
it's on the radio (or so I'd assume).

My father learned a similar lesson from someone who lived near Temple
(which is also a horrible neighborhood).

Lesson number one: conceal anything of value.  If you're dumb enough to,
say, leave your wallet in plain sight, you *deserve* to have it stolen.

Lesson number two: always buy foreign cars.  (I assume you're talking
about different tools, but this still applies.)  A moderately intelligent
thief will realize that your tool set is metric and thus will work on crap
in this country.

Lesson number three: advertise the presence of your car alarm as a
theft-deterrent.  If the thieves are thick enough to actually *run* when
an alarm goes off (what's the point?), they probably won't spot it -- or
believe it -- but it's the cost of a sticker or flashing light.

You can, by the way, buy a flashing light from Performance Products.

Lesson number four: if a thief wants to get into your car, he can do it,
no matter what sort of theft-prevention devices you have installed.  This
is the lesson my father learned.  He was told that if you lock your car
and a thief wants something in it (or the car itself), you have to pay for
a new window.  If you leave the doors unlocked, you still collect the
insurance and don't have to pay for the window.  So, my father did just
that for about ten years, and his car was never stolen.

Lesson number five: if you're going to invest in an alarm system, don't
worry about "features" so much as usefulness.  Alarms rarely, in my
experience, frighten away a determined thief -- namely, one who would take
the whole car.  Would you rather replace a stereo and maybe the dash, or
the entire automobile?  So, don't worry about how many decibels the alarm
produces, or if the panic button works OK, or if the lights flash.

The most effective sort of "alarm" that I know of is the type that cuts
off the fuel pump and relies on a changeable code sequence to work again.
Most thieves don't know enough about cars or alarms to actually work
around this, especially when there may be an easier target nearby.  The
code can't really be broken without a lot of work, especially if it's a
code you enter (rather than one that's sent when you push a button).

> I've used this technique for years and it has worked for me also.

As have I.  I have an added bonus, though -- because I'm working on the
wiring for my stereo, I have it sticking out halfway.  At first, I was
worried about this, but during the time when it wasn't working at all, I
stopped thinking about it.  It hasn't been stolen or even touched, despite
parking for three or four hours at nighttime between an abandoned
industrial park and an extremely low-income part of town.

I guess the would-be thieves think the radio's broken?
