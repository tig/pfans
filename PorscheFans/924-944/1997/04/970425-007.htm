The easy way to get 924 Carrera GT power (210 PS) out of a 924 turbo is
to use the original (or rebuild) parts of the GT. But the first question to answer
for a conversion is for the modelyear of the car !
If you have a '79 or '80 924 turbo - forget it ! You MUST have a engine with the
electronic ignition system (made by Siemens). The Carrera GT is based on the
second generation of this engine (177 PS vs. 170 PS - European spec.). 

There is no chance to upgrade the engine to electronic ignition, cause nearly
every part is changed to add the electronic sensors and to increase the compression.

So if you have one of these older 924 turbo you should try to get a second generation
engine and the modified clutch cage first. If you have one of the newer 924 turbo, the
upgrade is fairly easy. Just add the GT cooler and the GT ignition box - and you should
have at least 200 PS ! (Don't forget the air hood for the cooler). The job will take less
than 30 min and is very easy.

The remaining 10 PS can be found by replacing the exhaust system.

The next step would be to go for the 924 Carrera GTS or GTR specs, but that is
a different story. It is very expen$$ive and takes a while to get the 250-320 PS.
Makes only sense if you want to race that car.

Since I have all documents like workshop manuals and parts-list available, I'm able to give
you the part numbers you would need. Feel free to mail, if you need some further information.
