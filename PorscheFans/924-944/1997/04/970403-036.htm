My '89 951 also failed the emission test on the idle portion.  I took 
the shortcut and took it to Jim Ellis.  Cost me about $50 and the car 
passed fine.

Subject:	85.5 944 emissions

I posted a message last week about my 85.5 944 failing the new GA
emissions.  The only thing that failed was CO at idle.  It needs to be 
at
1.20 and mine was at 2.16.

I ran by Automobile Atlanta and they told me to try new plugs and air
filter.  I checked the records and it has been about 25k miles since 
either
was changed so I changed them.

I took the car back and it failed again - same problem - CO at idle. 
 This
time the CO was down to 1.66.

I took the car by Automobile Atlanta today they hooked it up to their
exhaust analyzer.  The car only registered 1.04 at idle which was 
very
confusing.  But the way the state test works is as follows:
2500 rpms for 30 seconds
idle for 30 seconds

When we kept the rpms at 2500 for 30 seconds - all the numbers were 
good.
Then we backed it off to an idle and the CO's go up to about 2.50 
then
gradually return to around 1.04 after 45-50 seconds.  So the problem 
is the
car can't recover to 1.20 within 30 seconds.  It will dip below the 
1.20
after 35-40 seconds but that is too much time which causes the car to 
fail.


Can anyone think of anything to make to CO recover quicker?  I read in 
the
Haynes Emissions manual that the O2 sensor should be changed every 
60k.  My
car has 82k and it has never been changed.  The techs at AA don't 
think a
new O2 sensor will make a difference and they also said there isn't 
any
adjustment they can make to help.

If anyone has any ideas I'd love to hear them.

Thanks,

Michael
