I have not had a lot of response to my previous posts concerning R-12
alternatives. My guess is that most people are staying with R-12, and
putting off dealing with the problems of changing to a freon alternative.
That is what the local Porsche dealer advised me to do.=20

Due to the limited response (lack of knowledge on this subject?), I have
decided to contribute my findings to the list.=20

I found an informative website at:  http://www.santech.com

I don't pretend to fully understand all the information presented. Perhaps a
chemist or engineer on the list could take a look at it, and explain it to
me/the list. From what I do understand it appears that there are major
problems with alternative coolants such as that marketed by Pennzoil.

The overall impression I got was that Pennzoil's Frig-C works well with both
nitril and neoprene O-rings. However it's performance with HNBR O-rings was
marginal. Does anyone have any idea what kind of O-rings and seals were used
in the '82 924?

According to the report, calls to service facilities that have charged
systems with these alternate refrigerants have mixed results. The reports
range from=20
catastrophic to successful systems even with the same refrigerant. The=20
types of seal and hose failures on the unsuccessful systems are listed=20
below:
    =95Seals swelling where they would no longer fit into the glands=20
    =95Seals splitting open
    =95Seals extruding between metal gland surfaces
    =95Seals turning into a gum type material
    =95Hoses leaking throughout the length of the hose
    =95Hoses collapsing on the suction side due to softening

Tests on GHG-X4 showed poor to marginal results on all three types of
O-rings. GHG-X4 is basicly the same as R-406A.

At http://www.worldserver.com\R406A\compat.txt there is an article that
causes me additional concern:  Seals may fail (usually 30 mins to one hour)
after the engine is turned off, due to heat soak from the radiator bleeding
into the condenser and raising pressures.  Leaky heater water valves
contribute to the problem since they allow heat to build up in the
evaporator area, further increasing the pressures.   Dirt buildup in the
radiator and condenser area also contribute by preventing the release of
trapped heat after the engine is turned off.

Additionally, cars with poorly maintained cooling (radiator) systems, may
encounter radiator boilovers and overheating problems when changing to
GHG-X4 or R-406A, since more heat is transferred to the condenser, which
rejects the heat into the radiator.=20

I would like to suggest that it may be benefitial if we make a group effort
to solve this problem that we will all have to face sooner or later.
