Okay, Okay.  There's no such thing as blinker fluid as many of you have
already realized.  (James, did you really consult all of your technical
references and manuals?)  April Fool's Day reminded me of an actual post
that was made on an Air-Cooled VW newsgroup.  SOMEONE SINCERELY ASKED A
SIMILIAR QUESTION REGARDING BLINKER FLUID!  THIS IS TRUE!  I figured I'd
lighten things up a bit after some of the recent heated debates on NA 944's
vs Turbo's, etc.  The original sender on the VW newsgroup received dozens of
curious (insulting?) replies and remarks.  But I knew you guys have a sense
of humor and wanted to see what kind of reaction I would get if I tried this
stunt.  I posted pretty late last night, and I was surprised to have
received a couple replies 5 minutes after posting!  You guys jumped on this
one quick and carried it pretty far on your own too!
        Thanks for the laughs, and let's keep all of the list members
informed and amused.  I apologize to those of you who may think I wasted
valuable bandwidth with this joke.  And I'll let all of you know how the
synthetic blinker fluid works out.  Does this mean I can extend the service
interval to 6,000 miles before changing it again? :)
