I hav had the pleasure to see instructor drivers at Porsche drivers ed
events run considerably faster with their 'daily transport banger' than
many of their students do with 911:s, 944:s and 951:s. This is because
most unexperienced drivers tend to underestimate the speed levels that
is achievable when driving real smoothly.

Also, driver instructors usually teaches a general 'ideal track' -
without going into that a slightly different approach may give better
results for a certain driver-car combination...  The goal is often set
to teach good racing track behaviour rather than revealing the secrets
of that really fast lap.

As racing goes, even 951:s are relatively slow and powerless (looking
for my old Nomex suit now - hear the wooosh-wooosh-wooosh sound of
flamethrowers already...) 
and it is essential to keep speed up as high as possible. Everytime you
give speed away, it will take some time to recover it - more so if the
car is powerless (relatively!!!). Therefore the perfectly executed curve
is different for all combinations of cornering ability (car+driver) and
acceleration potential(car). 

Advice for learning from a fast guy driving the same type of car as you
have is therefore extremely valid.

Look at rally drivers: They compete in very different cars on the same
roads. 4wd cars with 500+ hp drive much differently in corners than 150
hp two wheel cars do.
The current trend is to brake hard, find a small radius track and
accelerate as much as possible out of it - but in weaker cars, a higher
speed track is often a better choice as the exit speed will be higher.

As for turbo lag on road cars, bear in mind that gear ratios are chosen
for road/street use and acceptable economy and not for maximizing power
availability on race tracks. The Turbos power band is not narrower than
(almost any) similar NA car, but it may feel that way because of that
torque is extremely evenly distributed on a 951. The power buildup is
almost linear to engine revolutions - wich, I think, was a design
objective when creating the boost map for the brain. 

NA:s actually *loose* power on the top end, and the equation for gear
change is different (means: may be detrimental to speed to rev too high
- read your cars torque curve...) wich creates the impression of more
low end torque - its only a relative thing.  
  
Have fun !
