OK, as promised, I spoke with the chemists regarding refrigerants like
FR-12, R134a, FRIGC (pronounced FRIDGE-ik), and I present my findings
below.  DISCLAIMERS:  I don't sell this stuff, and neither do these
chemists, so application information may not be perfect.  IE. they know
exactly how to make the stuff, but the sales force is most knowledgeable
about applications, and I did not get hold of a salesman yet (they're
all travelling).  If I make incorrect assumptions here, please point
them out kindly, and if my "anti-salesman filter" didn't catch
something, I apologize, as I'm trying to be impartial here.

In a nutshell:

FREON (FR-12), was manufactured by DOW in this country, and is now being
phased out.  Supply and demand dictates that as stock gets lower, prices
will get higher.  There's some large squirrel-stock with some of the
larger auto manufacturers, but it's not for general resale.  They have
basically retooled, as of '93 or '94, for R134a.  This leaves us looking
for an ever-diminishing supply of FR-12, some of which may be the result
of "re-capture".

There are a few reasons why R134a is a more expensive retrofit.  It has
a different "pressure profile", which in this case boils down to (no
pun, honest) operating at much higher pressures than FR-12.  Our cooling
systems in older cars are not intended for all this pressure. 
Additionally, the lubricant is different, being a polyol ester-based
lube which is not completely compatible with the oil-based lube in our
older cars.  This can cause problems with seals, gaskets, etc.

There are several replacements (if not more), that are mostly called
"blends" because they contain multiple ingredients.  One is called
"Chillit"?, one is called FRIGC, and there are others I don't know the
names of.  I will stick with FR-12, R134a, and FRIGC in this letter,
because the others are flammable, and the chemists told me they are not
a good idea because of that (they contain lots of butane, I guess). 
That's their opinion, and you are obviously welcome to yours. ;-)

According to the chemists, FRIGC is much less ozone-depleting than
FR-12, is non-flammable, is cheaper than FR-12 due to the obvious supply
factors, and is more cost-effective than R134a for older cars because
the only retrofit required is the installation of a left-hand threaded
nipple (by law), so you can't cross-connect the refrigerant tanks. 
Additionally, the polyol-ester lube used in FRIGC is compatible with the
oil-based lube in FR-12, so a "recharge" consists of evacuating the
remaining FR-12, then simply recharging with FRIGC, which operates with
the same pressure profile (or pretty darn close), as that of FR-12. 
(R134a retrofits require a removal of all old lubricant as well,
replacement of seals for the new lube, etc.).

InterMagnetics General Corp. patented the stuff (stock ticker IMG, take
a look at it, it's gone down BAD over the last year for some reason),
they specialize in cryogenics, like cooling superconducting magnets, and
it's marketed by their subsidiary InterCool.  Me, being an MIS Manager,
would have no way of disputing the chemists or of validating their
information, so please decide for yourself the size of the salt grain
you would like to apply to this information.

Take care.  Hope this helps.  Hope this doesn't get posted 200 times...
