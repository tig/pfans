I am looking for a 944S or S2 and this weekend I made a test drive in 
a 1987 944S. First of all I have to say that everybody is correct 
that the 2.5l 16V engine does not feel any faster than the 2.5 l 8V 
engine (I drive a 924S now). I noticed the following problems on the 
car:

1. Battery was totally shot (after driving 20 minutes, shutting it 
off and turning the key to on again there wasn't even a light which 
came on. They started it with a separate battery)
2. There was some vibration at idle (motor mounts)
3. Vibration at 3000 rpm (clutch)
4. When releasing the throttle and applying it again while driving 
there is a kind of clunk and it feels very rough. (clutch ?)
5. Even after driving for 20 minutes the idle oil pressure does not 
drop below 4 bar.
6. Above 5000 rpm the engine cut out (completely).

I am not worried about the clutch, I am a reasonably experienced 
mechanic and I think I can do the replacement myself. The motor 
mounts are also no problem, I have already replaced those on my 
current car. The questions I have are the following:

1. Why does the oil pressure stay at 4 bar (even at idle). Is this 
normal for a 944S?
2. Could the engine cut out at 5000 rpm have something to do with the 
bad battery.
3. The steering was not as crisp as my 924S, the tires on the 944S 
were 215/60 15" which is wider than the 195/65 on my 924S. Could this 
be the cause? (I did not check the tire pressure)

Thanks in advance.
