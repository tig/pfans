The question submitted to the list was:

"Why is dot5 (Silicone) brake fluid not recommended for Porsches"

There have been a large number of answers sent to me by members of the
list. All was nice and helpful. The answers were unambigous, silicone
brake fluid is *not* to be used in Porsches. However, explanations
lacked - it was mostly stated as a well known no-no.

As I got interested in the issue - and the reasons behind it - I did
some 'research' on my own. Here is what I found:

The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first
DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based. Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids,
Silicone fluids do not absorb water at all. The problem is that any
water present pools up interfering with braking performance and
corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. The
water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake
calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. Water, BTW, cannot be kept
out of a car brake system - the plastic and rubber components are
permeable to water (!) and over a period of time, water will be present
in any brake system, regardless of how well sealed it is. Changing brake
fluid every two years give ample safety margins, however.           

Because of this phenomenon, it is regarded essential when converting to
Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
beforehand. There also have been recommendations of replacing all rubber
parts in the brake system when converting. 

Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  
1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles),
which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and
2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4
fluids, they have high temperature failure modes which look (and feel)
the same as a 'boiling' DOT-4 fluid.  

Silicone fluids *may* make sense in some applications, but they are
certainly not recommended for high performance driving.

I also have become aware of fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do
not contain Silicones. They are reported to be reasonably compatible
with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids. They are sometimes also
designated as DOT 5.1

Applications where Silicone fluids may be worthwhile do exist, however.
The low temperature viscosity makes this fluid work at extremely low
temperatures, the long term stability is reported to be very good, and
the deterioration of rubber seals may be lessened for vehicles subjected
for long term storage. That is, reportedly why the US Army (and the
Swedish!) use it for their stored vehicles. 

Thanks to all who responded!
