This is not a consumer's risk.  They are counting on the fact that most people will not
argue against the shop and drop it.  I forced a shop to pay several hunderds of $ in repair (for those living in Missouri, USA, the place is one of the Dobbs chain) on damages to my Mazda (two stripped studs, destroyed ball joint, destroyed knuckle bolt, ...).  I had to threaten to reporting them to the attorney general, reported them to their customer service department and would not leave thier shop until I was satisfied.  The shop did not give in right away but the idea of a suit was not appealing to them so they paid up.

Make them pay for everything.

Again, make them pay.
