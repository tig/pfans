P-fans:

My Northern Ohio Region PCA newsletter for April quoted a "PR newswire" from
Porsche Cars North America discussing a 148% increase in sales year-to-date
for 1997 compared to 1996.  The actual number of cars was 2329 compared to
941.  I think "year-to-date" means through February.  Most of the increase
was due to Boxster sales.  The interesting part for me was the table listing
the breakdown of sales by model, which showed Porsche dealers selling 3 new
968s in the first 2 months of this year, compared to 2 new 968s during the
same months last year.  Is this possible?  Can one go to a dealer and buy a
new 968 now?  I assume that these are 1995 models -- could they be left over
for over 2 years?  Would they be heavily discounted by this point?

Very interesting.
