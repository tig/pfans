Hi there everyone -
I have several questions about my '88 Turbo S. If anyone can help, please
join in.
1) Exhaust leak: When starting the engine completely cold, there is a small
exhaust leak on the right side of the engine that goes away in about 30-60
seconds. Could this be a leaky waste gate? 
2) Shocks: After 50k plus miles, I would like to replace the shocks. What
works and what doesn't? The rear end tends to jump around under moderate to
hard cornering - the 'wash board' effect.
3) Overheating: When at highway speeds the indicated guage temperature is
normal, at the first white mark. But around town the guage will frequently
climb up towards the red mark. The motor never boils over, or feels
unusually hot. Does anyone know what temperatures correspond to the
different guage marks?
4) Brakes: I want to replace the pads with some 'soft' pads to accomplish -
longer pad life, and greater stopping power. What works?
5) Noisy throw-out bearing - nuisance? or dangerous situation?
6) Ball joints: the car tends to pull to one side or the other when
traveling along uneven parallel groves in the pavement. Does this indicate
worn ball joints or tie rod ends, or both?

Thanks for your thoughts!
