After a few hours searching the web I've come up with more questions than
answers.

Apparently the GHG-X4 I referred to in my previous post will leak through
Nitrile rubber hoses. Later model US cars come with Barrier type hoses which
are okay. Does anyone know what kind of hoses are on an '82 924? What about
the 'O' rings and seals? Could I be so lucky that they are neoprene?

I also came accross several referances to a dehydrant/sealant called Dry-Pak
or Cryo-Silane (made by Cryo-Chem, Inc.) It is reported to seal A/C systems
with a freon leak rate of 3 weeks to 1 year.  What I have not been able to
find is any URL, address or phone number for this company. Does anyone know
of a source for this product? Has anyone tried it?

Michael
