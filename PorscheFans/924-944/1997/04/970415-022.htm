I've been a Porsche owner and a member of this list for all of a month =
now.  I have found the list to be an invaluable resource for 944 owners. =
 Someone recommended a few weeks ago about the possibility of writing =
some sort of manual from the archives.  It seems that there are only =
about 2 dozen recurring problems with the 944.  It would be great to =
identify a list of these common problems (oil in water, sunroofs, CV =
joints, etc.) and have different qualified members volunteer to write up =
the proper maintenance and/or repair procedure.  I would then be happy =
to volunteer to produce these "write-ups" in HTML format and burn a CD =
so they could be viewed using a web browser.  If the author of the =
write-up chose to include photos of the procedure, they could be added =
as well.  Then if anyone wanted a copy of the CD, they could either send =
me a blank CD or $10-12 (the cost of a blank CD) and I'd send them a =
copy.  Also, if anyone had the space on their web site, they could post =
the files on the Internet as well. =20

I've been coding HTML for about a year and even produce the web site for =
my employer.  I'm a network engineer and not a programmer, but these =
HTML documents could look very professional without much work.  If you'd =
like to see some of my work, it can be seen at:

If anyone has any other thoughts, drop me a line
