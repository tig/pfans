Sounds like an excellent feature!  My Alpine 3D-Shuttle head-unit has a
detachable face as well as "Code-In Security" that requires entry of the
proper 4 digit code to turn on the stereo after its power supply has been
disconnected.  While 4 digits may seem like a pretty small figure, Alpine
has incorporated a feature that makes it much more difficult to crack the
code.  It will accept 2 or 3 wrong codes (buffer for accidental mistakes in
owner entry) before waiting 10-20? minutes for the next available code-entry
prompt.  After each successive wrong entry after this, the time between
code-in prompts increases sort of exponentially.
        Another good feature that my Alpine and most other high-quality head
units have is a red LED that flashes from somewhere on or behind the face
when the car is turned off.  A constant power supply (for clock, presets,
etc.) maintains this flashing warning light while the owner is away from the
vehicle and it functions similarly to a car alarm's LED.  It merely warns
anyone peering into your car that your stereo is protected by some sort of
theft-deterrent device or feature.
        There is even a flashing LED kit ($25-$40?) you can buy to mount on
your dash somewhere that is supposed to make it LOOK like you have a car
alarm installed in your car.  It can save some money (as opposed to
installing a complete, real alarm) and may in one sense be as effective as
real alarms, assuming that thieves do recognize these LED's and will
probably avoid cars equipped with them.

a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
