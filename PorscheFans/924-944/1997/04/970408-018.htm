if anyone is a lawyer and can help me out here is the question;
while my car was parked in the Baylor University parking facility some 
#@$#@$#@$#@ took it upon themself to key it. the damage done is on the hood and 
some on the door. the estimate i got for a total respray of the whole car was 
about 2500-3000. the hood and the door were going to cost about 600$. is there 
any way i can make the university pay for the damage since at the time the car 
was in their care and there are police who are supposed to be patrolling the 
garage??  if not i suppose it is my loss and maybe in the future i will put the 
car cover on every time i get out of the car.  it just seems that at a 
university where nice care are not abnormal a mid 80's less than 10000$ car 
would not be the main keying target, especially not when a viper and a 96 Lt-4 
vette are parked on either side of it!!
thanks 
matt
