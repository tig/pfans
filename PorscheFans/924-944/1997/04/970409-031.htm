Paul,

        I had this problem occur with both of my door locks within a year of
each other.  There is a plastic, piston rod on your door lock motors that
actuate the mechanisms.  It is connected to the locks themselves by a ball &
socket joint.  What often fails is this joint, because either the ball on
the plastic rod wears out or the socket has "loosened" too much or cracked.
Or you may have a combination of both phenomenon.  The plastic rod itself
can also snap, I suppose.  A temporary fix (one which would still require
you to take off the door panel, so I recommend fixing it permanently by
replacing the rod) can be done by replacing the loose ball within the socket
and re-securing it with zip-wire or something.  A better fix would be to buy
a new plastic rod and replace the worn or broken one.  It's really cheap,
like $5, and you don't have to replace the whole lock motor or anything.
Labor on removing one door panel, replacing the part, and putting the door
panel back on is about an hour and a half.  This is one you can do yourself
if you have the time and a manual that describes how to CAREFULLY remove
your door panel.  Good luck!

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
