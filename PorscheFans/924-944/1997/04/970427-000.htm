Hey dude,
There is something wrong there then, or perhaps you've got the Stage I
chips.  The Stage I chips seem to just increase the fuel mixture and
bump up the timing to give better throttle response and to get air
moving through the turbo to reduce lag.  The Stage II has the bleeder
bolt or boost bolt.  The boost bolts sometimes have to be tweaked to
get the correct boost.  Some bolts that I've seen have been so open that
they give almost stock boost levels.  By using different jetting (on
the older bolts) or by drilling the welds, you are supposed to set the
boost with a proper gauge.

Let me know what Stage you have and if you installed a bolt or not.  If,
after that, we do not solve the problem, we can go over a number of things
to determine the power loss.  Your car should absolutely fly with chips.
The change in performance is dramatic.  Even if you are coming from an "S"
model, the chips give you a realistic 30hp over stock and an increase in
torque as well.

Farzaan.
