Hi John (& John's friend),
Don't know if you have seen it but there is a similar thread regarding this problem. (I started it!) I put in a new clutch kit this winter and I have exactly the same problem. I have noticed that my vibration is actually centered at 3900 rpm. I would say that my problem is annoying but not life threatening (mechanical life that is). If you get any great advise let me know. I am on the verge of removing and inspecting the whole nine yards. LOTS of work, even more on the 951.
Can you tell us what was done in his clutch replacement? 
Which kit,  who did the work and what parts were replaced.
I would appreciate the info so I can try to solve my vibration and also help your friend.
How was the Bridge? I have driven there since 82' (in a Shelby GT350). I really love that track. (Really hate the stuff on either side of the asphalt!! (SAND))
Did your friend get any lap times?

Chris White (Still picking up bad vibrations)
