Hey dudes,

This is a super long shot, but I thought I'd try anyways.  Ever since travelling
on the decayed I5 in Washington, I've had this really annoying dash noise.  It's
not really a rattle, it sounds more like two pieces of metal touching.  I was
hoping to have my stereo in by now, but of course all of that was stolen last
week from my garage so I can't just crank the music up.  I do drive with the
windows down whenever I can, but it's really irritating me.  It sounds like it
is coming from straight in front of me.  I've tried tightening every screw,
loosening a couple, anything.  Any ideas if there is a common noise creator
on the dash???

I've managed to find someone that has old turbo cup videos so we "S" dudes
can see where our cars came from.  I've only managed to source one race, one
year review and one race of the old cup cars (944 normally aspirated).  Does
anyone on the list have any copies laying around?

Farzaan.
