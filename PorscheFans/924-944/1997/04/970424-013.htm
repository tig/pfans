I joined PCA about 3 weeks ago.  A few days later I email my region's
communications person (Peachstate) introducing myself - also asking some
basic questions about preparing my car for a drivers ed event at Road
Atlanta at the end of May.  I'm rather disappointed - I haven't heard
anything from anyone at Peachstate.  So I bring my questions to the list.

I read about a week ago, someone posted an excellent check list of things
to do after buying a 944.  Things like - change the oil, coolant, brake
fluid, etc.  I've had my car about 5 weeks now and I want to complete the
things that need done.  I have excellent records for this car so I'm fully
aware when all services were done.

This weekend I'd like to tackle the brake fluid and coolant.  Brake fluid
I've changed in cars dozens of times so I assume there is nothing special I
need to know. (?)  BTW, the car has a blue colored brake fluid in it now. 
Anyone know what kind it is? 

Flushing the coolant system.  I've been on the PorscheFans FAQ and read
about getting all the air out of the system.  Any tips on actually flushing
the system?  Unless there is anything special to do, I'd probably just
drain the radiator, maybe turn the engine over without starting the car to
drain more coolant from the block, and refill with fresh coolant (phosphate
free, right?).

Also, if there is anything else anyone can suggest I do to ensure my car is
ready for a drivers ed event - I'd be extremely grateful.  I drive this car
everyday but only put about 150 miles a week on the car.  TIA
