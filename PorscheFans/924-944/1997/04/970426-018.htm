In response to the messsages the last couple of days on rear glass; I
had problems with both my 87 944 and my 94 968. On both cars the rear
window became loose and rattled after the car was in the sun for any
length of time. The solution for the 944 was simple.. turn on the air
conditioner and the rattle was gone in about ten minutes. The 968 was
not as simple..it rattled even in the winter and turning on the air
conditioner did not work summer or winter. Fortunately, the dealer after
approval by PCNA replaced the 968 window under warranty. The first time
lasted about six months and they replaced it a second time and its been
fine since. The second time required a trip back 30 days after
installation for adjustments. In summary, there must be a
design/assembly fault and it is fixable. If you are out of warranty
though, it will cost you about $2000 including the new window.
