Hi all:
A little while ago I posted several inquiries about a vibration I had (centered at 3900rpm). I have made it disappear with the aid of George B!! In case anyone else suffers the same I'll tell the story.
I purchased the car from a friend of mine last fall with a bad clutch (Typical rubber center thing) and replaced the clutch ect this winter. One of the things I also replaced was a very badly worn shift lever. I figured that the PO was the kind of guy who drives with one hand on the shift knob. (Evil) When spring finally arrived and I put the car on the road there was this annoying vibration. Fearing the worst I was contemplating removing the drivetrain to look at the new clutch kit for a balance problem. I figured that a trip to visit a knowledgeable 944 guy would be a good step first. After calling George B. and finding some time in our schedules I drove over to his place (260 miles) and let him drive it around to check it out. "Balance  shaft belt" he declared. Hmm, no ones been in there for 20k according to the records. So I drove it home and the next morning took it apart. It seems that the PO mechanic must have been not quite as good as the PO thought. Both balance shaft gears were installed in the 'O' (Ober or upper) position. Maybe he thought that this was a secret Porsche statement "Germany Ober Alles" (please excuse German spelling)!! Well anyway - I returned the lower gear to it's correct keyway position and reassembled it. Gee so this is what it supposed to feel like...cool.
I have figured out in perfect 20/20 hindsight that the out of balance shafts caused the vibration that wore the original shift linkage to about 50% of it's normal size. Everything else seems fine. Any ideas on what to check for 20k miles of vibration wear??
Other side effect - now it is much quieter I can hear my pinion humming, not to bad but it is noticeable.
BTW the PO told me that this guy was a great Porsche mechanic...right.  Well at least the thought of belt changes no longer intimidates me.

PS- Thanks George and all others who helped.
