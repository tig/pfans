Hi everyone,

I just got a digest for the 14th... woohoo! First one in a week or two.

Anywho, I've got a question. My '84 944 hasn't been just right for quite
a while, I've been living with it, but I've noticed a slight degradation
in performance. Actually, I haven't been living with it, I've been trying
little things every so often to see if they'd help. Nothing has. The next
little thing is my oxygen sensor.

I have noted that with the sensor unplugged, there is no difference at
idle. Should the difference be apparent when it's not connected? I think
I'm going to try driving a little tonight with it unplugged to see if
there's anything noticeably different. I'd like to think it's in there
for something. If anyone has experience with this guy, please let me
know. I'd appreciate it.

I should point out that my mechanic friend doesn't even think there is
a problem (without really checking anything) and the car has been tuned
up recently.

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
