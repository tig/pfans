In a message dated 97-04-19 20:52:17 EDT, you write:

<< As for the idle, mine jumped around until I got some contact cleaner 
 and sprayed the inside of the connector to the throttle position 
 sensor, all is well now.

FYI
This is the most frequent source of intermittent boost problems on Turbo's.
Especially the Turbo S model of 88 and 89. I, and two friends, spend
countless hours trying to trouble shoot the problem. Everytime we went to the
dealer and used his code reader it came out "defective throttle position
switch." We would buy new switches and that would cure the problem for 4 to 6
months, then back to intermittent boost and a new switch. Luckily Porsche
warranties their parts. Finally we discovered that simply wiggling the
connection fixed the problem for the same 4 to 6 months. A careful cleaning
and some di-electric grease solved the problem permanently for all three of
us!!
BTW I could always tell the days when I was going to have a boost problem
when I started the car in the morning. If it had a lumpy or somewhat strange
idle I only had the default boost, 1.2 bars on the gauge.
