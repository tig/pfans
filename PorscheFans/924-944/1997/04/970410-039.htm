As far as wanting someone to trust to turn down your rotors, I would be
somewhat cautious about who I let do this for me. I let one of my sons
friends turn down a pair from a Conquest I had a couple of years ago,
just to clean up the rust. When I *tried* to stop, I found I had the
WORST case of pulsating pedal there ever was!!! He had been turning them
down for customers for about a week before I let him have at mine, but
for some reason had a little difficulty getting mine set correctly on
the machine - voila, rotors to the scrap pile.  So much for my freebie
turn-down. Usually, a well established shop is a good hedge against this
sort of thing. Also, more exp. could result in less metal removal to get
the job done, which could net another turn-down down the road.

P.S. He gave me a deal I couldn't "turn down" on a brand new pair of
rotors & many parts discounts since then!
