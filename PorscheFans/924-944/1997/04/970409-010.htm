I am Looking for some more advice..

Vehicle      : '86 944, '87 engine with automatic cambelt tensioner

Documentation: Haynes Manual, Factory Workshop Manuals, 944 FAQ, etc..

Current state:

o All Front suspension removed, including steering rack, engine shield,
etc..
o Front Faring Removed
o Bumper removed
o Radiator and Air Conditioner Condensor removed
o Water Pump, Air Cond. Compressor, power steering pump,cam&balance
shaft belts, rollers, housing, etc. removed.
o The housing which holds the Upper and Lower Balance shaft seals
removed. Both Balance shafts have about 0.05" of play.  Is this ok??
The balance shafts are still in their housing, and the plain bearing on
the inside is the only one on the shaft.  Obviously this is a big lever,
so the actual play on the inner plain bearing is not 0.05".

+-0.025" play on end of balance shaft where balance shaft gear attaches.

I could not find any info in the workshop manuals as to when the balance
shaft bearings need to be replaced, they just show the procedure..  Any
advice?

o The Crank Shaft seal is the only one that was leaking, but I am
replacing all of them while I am at it, along with the races (ZIMMS
kit).  I now need to remove the crank shaft seal.  to do this,  I need
to remove the oil pump housing.  In both the Haynes, and the workshop
manuals, they show that it is necessary to remove the oil pan to remove
the oil pump housing&crankshaft seal.  My question is, is it ok of I
just loosen the oil pan enough to remove the oil pump housing?  I think
I can access all of the oil pan bolts without removing the crossmember. 
If I do this, will the oil pan leak? (The assembly process usually would
inlude the application of a sealant to the oil pan gasket, so I am
concerned that breaking the existing seal, and then re-tightening
without cleaning and re-applying sealant will allow oil leaks.) 
Otherwise, I will need to rent an engine hoist.

Ok, now that I have the engine very accessable, any thing else I should
do?  Here is what I am replacing..

o rebuilding right A-arm, replacing cracked left A-arm with used
o Tie Rod ends
o Wheel Bearings, seals
o rotors 
o brake pads (mintex)
o Balance and Cam shaft rollers
o Balance and Cam shaft seals, o-rings, and races
o crankshaft seal, crankshaft bolt
o cam, balance, power steering, and air cond./alternator belts
o Camshaft Bolt
o Cap, Rotor, and Rotor gasket
o Misc. Strut mount hardware
o De-greasing all parts, and generally checking things out..
o Left and Right window squeege
o Door handle gaskets
o Mirror gaskets

o I would also like to replace the valve guide seals.  There was
recently a short thread on doing this without removing the head. Has
anyone done this?  The two suggested method seems to be: use compressed
air to hold the valve while removing the spring and installing the new
seal.  I have looked in the automation and Tweeks catalogs, but can not
find a suitable valve spring compresson tool to use while the head is
still on the block.  Any suggestions for such a tool? 

Wow, this is getting to be a big note, so I will stop for now.

Thanks for any advice!
