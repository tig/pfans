If it is not to late have the head, intake manifold, exhaust manifold
and throttle body extrude-honed.   The results are fabulous and for the
cost (about $900.00), it is worth the Hp.  Deck the block from .020" to
..040". Have your cam reprofiled by a good cam grinder (such as
Web-Cam).  The bottom end is plenty strong, but have everything
rebalanced.  

The fuel injectors flow fine (same as a 930 turbo), but watch your CO%
when you get it running.  Is your turbo modified--lots can be done
there. The flywheel and clutch should be ok, just balance them with the
rest of the motor.

The 951 intercooler will fit in the nose and work well, with the 931
front ducting, but you may want to do a little sheet metal work to adapt
it.  The hoses will have to be fabricated, but that is not that big of a
deal.  As for the radiator, the 944 or 944 turbo radiators are much more
efficient and you want the motor to cool well.  Fabrication of radiator
mounts are easy, but if you use the 951 intercooler, you probably will
not be able to use the 951 radiator because it will hang to low.  The
radiator hoses for the 924 will adapt easy enough.

You probably can run one bar of boost with decent fuel, but be sure--be
sure--you don't have detonation.  Is your boost adjustable so you can
turn it down if neccesary?  I hope so.  Be sure and use the higher
strength head studs that are on the market (I have forgotten their
name). 
A good idea is to run a QUALITY boost gauge and EGT gauge if you can.

My former Carrera GTS Club Sport was a rocket (285 HP).  Your motor
would not be that high, but it would definitely be a standout.

Good luck...Don Istook
