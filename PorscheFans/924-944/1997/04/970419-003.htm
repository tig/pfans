Hi, PorscheFans,

During a Q&A period at the 1984 War Bonnet Tech Session, Chuck Stoddard 
answered a question regarding 944 front suspension quiver and had this to 
say about alignment.

"For years, Porsche always said to preload the suspension during 
alignment, which is a very good, logical way to do it.  It holds all the 
slop and wear outward because that's what the car feels when it goes down 
the road.  The wheels tend to push apart.  So they specify to set it 
while simulating the road conditions with a preload.  Unfortunately, most 
American shops don't have the facilities for this.  Very recently, the 
latest spec for all models, including 911s, etc., is a new spec setting 
wich is essentially greater toe-in and no preload.  It comes out to about 
the same answer, but if you have a choice, I would strongly recommend 
that you put a preload bar in front of and between the wheels, spread 
them all you can-I think it used to be about 40 pounds force was the 
spec-and adjust to at least five minutes toe-in on each side.  On a real 
bad car, you can go to 10 minutes on a side."

I realize that this information is 13 years old, but does anyone do wheel 
alignments like this any more?  That's the way my '83 was done in '85 and 
I was happy with it.  Any comments?
