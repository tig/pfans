okay i think because the tank of gas is so old that the fuel filter might be clogged, i am going to run a test with some techron and see if that clears it up.  the dealership in San Antonio is going to do a pressure check on the 16th.  at any rate the i had to heel-toe all the way home to keep the car from dipping down into the 900s once it got down there it wanted to keep going, like all the way to 200 (yes, it did die on me but i was in my garage)  i just replaced the belts yesterday and i might have got them too tight but i dont think this is the problem, i may very well have knocked a vaccuum line loose but i couldnt find it when i looked a while ago.  Both of the cooling fans were running though because of the temp. today but the temp. gauge read just over 1.5 slash marks.  

next problem, 
when going over  speed bump today (f@#@$@# things) the rear hatch came open on one side. seems that it will close and stay closed but a good tug on the left side and it will come right open, the answer to this looks like the little ball shaped piece and how it fits into the car, however, i have come to learn in the last few months nothing is simple or cheap on Porsches.  

thanks in advance
matt
still looking for a car cover
