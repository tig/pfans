The factory swaybars shouldn't be that expensive although aftermarket bars
may be an option also. More wiz bang Koni's are now available and at less
money than the ones Porsche would supply. The brakes are where life would
begin to get difficult.  Not so much the cost of the S4 caliper, but the
cost of the spindle that allows you to mount the caliper may very well be
staggering.  Probably a better option would be to get one of the brake
packages that allow you to mount the "big red" calipers.  I'd probably lose
the cross drilled rotors on a  do-it yourself M030 also.  But as you said,
the cost of the original package was pretty attractive.
