The oil pressure gauge on my '89 951 bounces within a ~1 bar range at idle.
It seems to do this mostly at lower oil pressures, i.e., once it's warmed
up.

I had a similar problem with an Audi oil pressure gauge -- it would exhibit
the same behavior once the car was warm and the pressure was hovering
around 1-2 bar. I always suspected a bad sending unit or possibly a bad
ground to the gauge, but never did anything about it.

Does anyone else have a similar problem? Is it something I should be
concerned about?

Thanks,

-Jeff
