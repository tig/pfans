Hi Marv,

If you really want Ss brake lines, why not get DOT approved lines? They
are made.

From Automotion:
   "...End soft, mushy brake pdel feel with teflon lines, stainless steel
braided brake lines....We also offer DOT legal stainless steel brake lines.
When ordering DOT lines, please add D to the end of the part number. Sold
as set of four lines."
924, 944 BL-380 Weltmeister $59.99, DOT $89.99

From Tweeks:
   "...Don't accept cheap imitations, Purchase only Earls (TM) Stainless
steel brake hoses...These hoses, unlike others, have been pressure tested
to 4000PSI which exceeds all DOT recommendations..."
944 	83-86	944SBH1  $74.95
944/S/S2/T 86+	944SBH2   74.95
944 M030	944SBH3	  74.95

I haven't seen a real compelling reason for SS brake lines. One of my friends
has them, I don't. His pedal is stiffer than mine. So? His brakes don't work
any better.

I suppose that when the times comes to replace my brake lines I'll probably
go to SS. I can't see replacing perfectly good rubber lines just for the
sake of SS. If I'm missing something, can someone enlighten me?

Usual disclaimers: I don't know anything about anything. I don't work for
Tweeks or Automotion, althought I have bought stuff from them and would
deal with them again.
