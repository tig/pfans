Hi all,

I guess this files under good advice, or under common sence advice.

This goes out to anyone attempting to remove any snap rings.  This goes out due
to the time wasted swearing, sweating, agonizing over something so small and
simple as a snap ring.

Simply put, any of the cheap under $12.00 snap ring pliers will not cut it when
trying to remove snap rings.  On the 944 there are two places that have snap
rings, the CV joints and the water pump.  The CV joints use snap rings to hold
the axle to the joint, the water pump uses a ring to hold the thermostat in.
 The CV joint snap rings use external force to open them, the water pump uses
internal (one pulls out, the other pulls in).

I've gone through 3 or 4 sets of cheap snap ring pliers before finally picking
up a semi decent pair (Hi-Tec, however Snap-On might have a good pair,
Craftsman doesn't, or I'm just not capable of using them correctly :) ).  The
cheap pliers I'm talking about usually have clips that must be screwed down
over the bits.  The clips never seem to hold the bits down, and usually I end
up breaking a bit.  Also pliers that are very thin should be avoided.  I was
having trouble where the pliers would warp as increased pressure was applied,
so the bits would not stay lateral to each other, so one would slip out,
causing lots of cussing.  Also the trouble with thin pliers is that they don't
have adequate handles (for my big hands at list), the handles tend to slip and
slide within the palm of my hand, making things impossible.

After finally picking up a good pair of snap ring pliers, it took one try to
get the rings off.
