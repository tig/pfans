I had this problem in both my first 944 and my current 951.  But it happened
a long time ago, both a week after I bought each car respectively.  (What
luck!)  All I needed was a new clutch slave cylinder.  (I think it cost
around $25-30 dollars?)  The piston rod in each were loose and not moving
properly because the seal around them had worn or become loose.  I knew it
was the slave because when you moved the rod, fluid would come out.  Once I
replaced them, clutch mobility returned to normal.  You have to bleed
everything though, and I didn't have one of those one-person pump things so
it was a pain in the butt.  I'm not sure of the actual mechanics involved,
but this may be your problem.  I really can't remember the details of how
the slave cylinder contributes to the clutch pedal's operation- someone else
explained it to me then.  Perhaps someone on the list who is more
knowledgeable could provide this information.  Hope this helps...
