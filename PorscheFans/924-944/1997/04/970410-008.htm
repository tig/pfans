        The problem with the lines is not that they work loose (at least I have 
        not seen this), but that they are susceptible to bursting caused by 
        rubbing against something or corrosion from brake dust.  I have had two 
        burst on my VW Jetta.  The lines were less than 2 years old.  If you do 
        decide to go with these lines you MUST check them on a regular basis for 
        wear and tear.  These line are not like the stock ones that are mostly 
        install and forget.

     Its the time of year to change the brake fluid to get ready for "driver 
     education" days with our club. I have been thinking of installing SS 
     brake lines this year on my '89 951. I should point out that this car 
     is also a daily driver. I have heard rumors that SS brake lines are not 
     recommended for a daily driver because the rigid hose is not designed 
     to take abuse on a daily bases and that SS brake lines have a tendency 
     to work them selves loose from the calipers on a daily driver (which 
     would be a bad thing). So I turn to the collective wisdom of this group 
     to dispel the rumors and get the strait scoop. 
     
     TIA,
