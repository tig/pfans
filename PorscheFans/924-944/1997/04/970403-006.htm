Hi all
Well spring has arrived where I live and the newly refurbished 86 NA is back on the road. The only plus I can attribute to our winters is that it gives me plenty of time to work on the car.
My 'new' problem is this:
After replacing the clutch this winter I now have a new vibration and accompanying sounds. If I can get everybodies $.02 maybe I'll have a collective buck worth of insight. (would require 50 respondence) Here are the symptoms - 
The vibration is most notable at 4000 rpm trailing of either above or below that number. 
The vibration is felt most under low load and not much at all under full load.
The vibration is not felt with the transmission out of gear at 4000 rpm.
The vibration is felt the most through the gear shift lever. 
Some what less noticeable when cold. (I usually don't go near 4000 rpm when cold but for the sake of testing I did)
The vibration is accompanied by a lot more low frequency noise from the exhaust than I remember. (during vibration but not at low or high rpm)
No vibration when car is out of gear at any speed. (OK any speed up to 120)
My guess is that the problem is engine related and not clutch disk / torque tube / transmission. (other wise I would get a vibration when the car was in gear and moving with the clutch depressed).
I used a Sachs clutch kit and I belive that the clutch pressure plate is balanced and can be installed in any position.
Could imperfect alignment of the exhaust system cause this?
Is this vibration description similar to a slipped balance belt? (I didn't touch it honest!)
Out of balance clutch kit?
Did I leave a wrench in the bellhousing?
Did I offend the Porsche gods by replacing the German stereo?

PS - I checked the blinker fluid and found the the pervious owner had already done the ultra expensive upgrade to the 911 non-fluid cooled system. I could have the muffler bearing problem.
