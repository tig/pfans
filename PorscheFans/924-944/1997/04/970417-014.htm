Hello,

The problem with the bluebook for this car is that the cars were made in
relatively low numbers. Best estimates I have show about 1000 1988 turbo S
and about 1400 89 turbo (S). I don't know how the blue book people can
be accurate with volumes that low. From my own research, I believe the
cars are selling for 13 - 18K, depending on condition of course. 

There have been a few people on this list who have recently bought and/or
sold these cars. They could provide you with more accurate and up to date
price information. Keep in mind that you can definately buy one of these
cars for 12K, and then have to spend 5K to make it decent. 

> who own 944 tur s (88-89'), it's a nice car??? does it have any problem?

It's a very nice car. Very (very, very, keep adding very) fast, very comfortable
very easy to drive. It really shines on the track. It's not all that fast
off the line, but once the RPMS are up, it's a rocket.

However, it is expensive to fix. If you can work on it yourself, it is not
all that expensive to maintain. Like all 944 models (and especially the 
turbos), there are a number of items that go wrong. Due to this great
list, almost all of problems have been identified, and the costs of
repair known ahead of time. The typical items are water pump, motor mounts,
and clutch. Some less important problems are the sunroofs, and power 
steering systems.

The cars can be difficult to find. You are not going to find one advertised
in the local paper. I looked for about 6 months before I found mine. Good
places to look are Porsche Panorama, Excellence, Hemmings, and Autoweek.

Good Luck,
