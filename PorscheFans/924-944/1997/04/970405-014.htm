Interesting project!

You can go really two ways here. One is to try to do it yourself, the
other is letting a shop do it. The problem with any shop is that they,
to be real sure of a good result, have to do a lot of work that may not
be neccessary - so the DIY way may be the best here. Do let a competent
shop check on safety related components, as brakes, tho'.
A shop manual will be useful (I like Haynes), and see this project
as a since long neglegted major tuneup.

Immediate problem areas on this (and any long unused) car will be:

The gas in it may (must?) have gotten 'old' - potential problem being
evaporation and deposition (varnish) buildup - and sludge may have
formed on the bottom of the gas tank - drain and refill with a few
gallons. The battery is most probably beyond all help, get a new one
The engine oil *must* be changed. Before any attempt is made to start
the engine, drain it without starting (that means cold), change filter
and fill up with new oil. The clutch may stick to the pressure plate or
the flywheel (or both).   

Secondly, all rubber based seals in brake system, clutch system and both
engine and gearbox will be suspect. Now, Porsche is a quality car, and 6
years is not a *very* long time - so some or all of them may be OK.
There is also a very real risk that cam and balance shaft belts are
brittle and have 'flat spots' - and if they fail, the repairs would be
costly.

At least consider changing the cam and balance shaft belts before
attempting to start the engine. This would probably mean thet you should
haul the car to a Porsche mechanic. Some of the seals on the front end
will be easy (well' sort of...) to change at the same time. Changing all
brake rubber components and brake fluid will give you peace of mind,
consider that too.     

However, if you are more adventorous:

Before starting the car, check out the following:

1. press on the brakes, real hard and for at least 1-2 minutes. If
anything breaks, the best time is in the garage, standing still. This is
important! Check for leaks. Then, try moving the car by hand, forward
and rearward to see that brakes are releasing. 
2. Turn on the ignition, wait some time for everything to settle and
check that the fuel pump is working. Check warning lights and see if
things work.    
3. Depress the clutch. If it feels normal and engages/disengages -
consider yourself lucky. If it does'nt - make sure that any attempts to
start the engine is with the gearbox in neutral.  

As for starting the engine, the key to success is fuel proper fuel
delivery and a clean spark. You may try starting the engine directly -
another strategy would be treating it like a rebuilt engine turning it
by hand - or pushing it gently with 4:th or 5:th gear in. After 6 years,
I would prefer to see oil pressure buildup and before trying to run the
engine, tho'. 

Good luck!
