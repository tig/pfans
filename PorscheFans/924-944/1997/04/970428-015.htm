Michael,

| I joined PCA about 3 weeks ago.  A few days later I email my region's
| communications person (Peachstate) introducing myself - also asking some
| basic questions about preparing my car for a drivers ed event at Road
| Atlanta at the end of May.  I'm rather disappointed - I haven't heard
| anything from anyone at Peachstate.  So I bring my questions to the list.

Well, on behalf of the region's Drivers Events Committee, welcome!  I can't
explain why you've not heard from anyone yet, but it seems to be a
recurring problem in the region (the new membership signup procedure
always seems to be really slow).

Anyway, with resect to prepping your car, pay particular attention to
the brakes and tires.  Check for a decent amount of pad material on the
brakes and plenty of tread on the tires. You should be getting a tech
form in the mail with a checklist of things to look for. And you'll want
to take it to a mechanic for a close inspection too.  Email me if you
have any specific questions or need a recommendation on a local shop.

And track me down (so to speak :-)) at the school -- I'll probably be
teaching the classroom session on saturday morning.
