i think i can only say one thing; 84 944NA 9 sec. 1/4mi.  sound cool"!!!
well it is cool because it has a small block 400 bored to 406. ran high 9
sec. at battle of the imports and even blew away a diablo VTTT.  check out
renegade highbrids they do some neat stuff and for all of you who have nasty
rusting older cars you were thinking of parting out this might be the answer.
there is also a 7 sec 924. it has a 454 w/ a blower and a hood scoop five 
feet tall it seems!!  there is also a place in england that has a 500Hp 
front engined 911 thing!!!  well anyhow now that i have suffieciently discussed
the odd things one can do to a porsche, ihave to say i dont like it.
the Hp is cool but if i wanted something of that nature i would have bought
a mid 60's camaro or a 93 ford cobra.  well justg my .02 and i thought someone
may be interested in a little who ever heard of that trivia stuff!!
