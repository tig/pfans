I've been reading the various replys on stereo theft and the various
code schemes used by the equipment maker.  Problem is, as I see it, is
that at this point the stereo is already gone, your dash damaged etc. 
There may be some relief in knowing that the "new owner" will have
troubles getting it running but you will still need repairs done and a
new stereo.

I find it curious that these schemes are considered theft prevention
when they don't even come into play until it is too late.

On the subject of alarms, I learned a lesson from a friend of mine who
lives in a horrible neighborhood:

  The first time, they broke his window in his truck and made off with
his tools.  (Cost: tools + window)

  Then he bought an alarm.  On the second occasion, they broke his
window, opened the locked door, set off the alarm and took off running.
(cost: window only)

  Finally the truck was left with the alarm set but the doors unlocked. 
Sure enough, he was visited again and many times more.  The shoppers try
the door, find it unlocked so don't bother to brake the window.  The
alarm sounds and sends them running. (cost: none)

I've used this technique for years and it has worked for me also.

Any comments would be interesting.
