Hi Matt,

Thanks for the reply.  Actually the car passed after installing the O2
sensor.  I had lots of people reply telling me pretty much what you said,
the sensor is getting tired.  Also, Auto Atlanta said there wasn't an
adjustment "they" could do.  They know how to adjust it but when we put it
on their analyzer it was reading well below the 1.20 I needed for passing
the test.  But the problem was it wasn't recovering from the 2500 rpm test
within 30 seconds.  It took the CO's 45 seconds to dip below 1.20.  I just
wanted to clear that up because the guys at AA are extremely knowledgable
and helpful.  They didn't even charge me for the shop time to hook it up to
the analyzer.  They suggested changing the O2 sensor which I did and it
passed.

I've only had the car 3 weeks now and I'm thrilled with the car.  I bought
it from a guy who used it as a 3rd/weekend car.  The car is extremely
clean.  I mean the interior looks as though no one has ever sat in it and
you could eat off of the engine.  The car only has 82k miles on it and I
think its the best $7900 I've ever spent.  If you care to take a peak at
the car you can check it out on my web page

Anyways, thanks so much for the input!
