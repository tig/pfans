For what it's worth, had exactly the same problem in my 83 944NA. Fuel pump 
relay, under the dash. If it's the same part in the 924, it's a VW/Audi 
part. Get the PN from Porsche then truck on over to the VW dealer and see 
if they have it. Saved me about $15. Not a big deal, but worth a try.

>I was driving home from work today and all of a sudden, my 924T died.  
While doing

my oil and

but to no

again.  The engine 
>would turn over, but clearly would not start.  After inspecting all of my 
belts, (which 
>are fine, including the timing belt) I am thinking this is either an 
electrical problem 
>or something with the fuel injectors.  Any other ideas to what the problem 
might be 
>before I tear into the engine on Saturday would be greatly appreciated.
