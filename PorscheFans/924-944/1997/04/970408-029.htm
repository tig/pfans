Look in your phone book for a brake shop.  Brakes are turned by a machine
and it is almost impossible to screw up.  Since they are rear rotors there
should not be much wear.  It is not rocket science.  It took me a solid
47.2 seconds to learn how to use a break lathe and it was explained to me
twice.  No worries.  Most brake places should have same day or next day
turn around.
