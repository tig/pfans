Porschefans:

I have posted notes before in which I complained that my D40M2s seem harsh
and noisy to me on my 92 968 (no M030) daily driver.  I drove an 89 C4 today
with Pirelli SP 7000 all season tires today.  The owner had had D40s in the
same sizes on the car before, but had the same complaints which disappeared
with the SP7000s.

I thought that the car handled with great precision, but that the ride and
noise level were significantly better than on my car with the D40s.  The
tires appear to have an aggressive tread pattern.  I don't care about
racetrack handling or autocrossing.  Has anyone tried these on a
water-pumper.  I already love my car, but a gentler ride and less noise would
be just that much nicer for my daily 20+ mile commute (each way).  By the
way, I do not need winter traction, since I have proper snows for that.

Thanks!
