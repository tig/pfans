From your comment, you must do driver's ed at Watkins Glen. That PCA
chapter is (as far as I know) the only chapter that does not allow
lowered 944s at driver's ed events (perhaps becaue it is such a fast
track and there were probably incidents in the past). Granted, ball
joint failures are common on post 85.5 944s that have been lowered TOO
FAR. However, A-arm failures are common on pre 85.5s whether they have
been lowered or not (particularly with the Weltmeister 28mm sway bar).
Regarding the racing a-arms (cannot remember the vendor!), I have seen
one separate from the upright at a track event at Bridgehampton on a
racecar. It may have been an installation/maintenance issue, but it did
happen!

But I have to take exception to your comment that lowering a 944 will
ALWAYS lead to ball joint failure. My favorite car company would not
offer the M030 option if it wasn't safe to lower 944s!

IMO, there are no absolute answers when it comes to the front
suspensions on 944s. My advice would be to inspect the front suspension
regularly (I have had 2 metal a-arms break catastrophically on my '84
944 so I went to the aluminum ones), don't lower too far (check that the
ball joints do not bind in full droop or compression), and use the
racing arms whenever the rules allow you that modification.
