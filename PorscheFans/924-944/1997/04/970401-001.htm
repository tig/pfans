I got tired of the hoses leaking at the reservoir and decided to fix it.
I started by siphoning all the fluid I could out of the reservoir, then
removed the clamps and hoses and pulled it from the car. I was fairly
sure the system had never been flushed so I attached a funnel to the hose
on the pump intake side and duct-taped a length of 1/2" plastic tubing to
the return. I put the return in a gallon jug, and poured a quart of P/S
fluid through the funnel as my helper started the engine and turned the
wheel from lock to lock.

I then cleaned the reservior with brake cleaner. There is a filter in the
bottom of the reservior which is not removable, but by back-flushing it I
was able to get it all clean.

The two nipples on the reservior have casting flash on them which I think
probably results in some of the leakage you see on these cars. I sanded
the nipples smooth with 400 grit sandpaper, cleaned the hose ends and
re-installed and re-filled the reservior.

That was 6 months and 4 track events ago and the thing has yet to leak
a drop.
