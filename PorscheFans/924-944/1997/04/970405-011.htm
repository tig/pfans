Todd:

Your project sounds similar to the one I am just completing.  Mine is a 79
924 that sat for 7 years outside under a cover with the transmission
removed.  This is not a project for the weak of heart.  If you can do the
work yourself go for it!  If not be prepared to spend some big bucks.  To
start I had to pull the fuel tank.  In my 924 I didn't have to pull the
transmission like the manuals said, but with the 44 I don't know.  I had
several rust holes in the top of the tank.  At the very least you need to
drain all of the old  fuel.  Neither of my fuel pumps would turn over.
Although repair isn't in the manuals I managed to get both of them apart to
clean all the varnish, etc.  They both work now so far.  I then disconnected
all fuel lines including the ones to the injectors and blew them out with
compressed air.  On my 924 and I suspect on this 944 the plunger in the fuel
distributor was stuck.  I couldn't get it free without taking the fuel
distributor apart.  This is not a proceedure recommended by the Porsche
folks because it is put together under clean room conditions and the least
speck of dust will allow it to weep a small amount of fuel.  So try real
hard to get the plunger free without disassembling the unit.  I still have a
problem with my warmup regulator I think.  I was able to resurrect my 924 by
doing all this without spending but $75.00 for the fuel tank cleaning and
sealing but If you look in the parts catalogs If I had screwed any of the
above proceedures up It could have cost big.
     My car sat on just the front tires for 7 years and they are ruined..
serious flat spots.  Your question of is it worth it... I paid $700.00 for
my 924 with 76,000 miles on it.  It was a huge gamble but I just finished
painting it last week and I have only $1200 in it.  If you can get this car
for free and the body, interior, and the rest of the motor are OK the worst
you can do is ruin the car so nobody can fix it.  There are lots of folks
out there that could advise you as you go along.  Good Luck!
