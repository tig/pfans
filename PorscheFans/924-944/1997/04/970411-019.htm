The reason for heating the hub when taking out the races is because of
the very fine tolerances involved in a 'interference fit'. Punching out
the old races 'cold' may make that fit a little less perfect, but it
will be OK to punch (drift) them out from a 'hot' hub - especially as
they will see no more use. It is quite OK to heat the hub in the kitchen
stove - but make sure it is heated long enough.

Most home mechanics don't have a hydraulic press, and the often
recommended practice of using a vice may be tricky, because of the
problems to get the race aligned correctly, holding a 150 C hot hub, and
turning the handle - all at same time.

A trick - and this is no joke - is to make it the temperature difference
even larger. Put the race in the refrigerator or -better- in the freezer
for 20 minutes before mating the hot hub and  sub-zero race. 

With a bit of luck, the race will go in with only a slight amount of
tapping. You can then use a vice and a suitable socket to make sure that
it is FIRMLY seated. 

Good luck !
