What you experience is not entirely uncommon on 24's sand 44's.  What is
happening is the hatch is being stretched out.  The hinge mounts are a
little to far from the latches and is therefore pulling the frame off.  I
went to a glass shop to have mine redone but they did not do it right and
the dimensions were wrong and it did not fit so be careful.  So inform
them that it has to be the right dimensions.  Also $190 sounds way too
expensive for a reglue.  

To stop the stretching and keep it from separating again you can do a
couple things.  One is use a lot of duct tape(my favorite) but it looks
bad and people will laugh at you on the highway.  The second is to make a
shim to raise the front of the window on the driver side hinge.  It will
be similar to the nut plate on the inside of the car.  It only needs to be
about 2mm thick and a hacksaw and a drill with a piece of metal will do
the job.  This did the trick for me.
