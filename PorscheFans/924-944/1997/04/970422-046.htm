Just joined the list and just got the car three days ago - an '89 944, =
120,000 miles but feels strong.  I do have a few things I need help =
fixing though.

1.   The steering wheel shakes a bit once you get to about 65mph, but =
not always.  There's new tires on (cheap ones - Yokohama 302's I think), =
and they "appear" to be balanced, that is there are at least "some" =
weights glued inside the wheel.  I checked the wheel bearings, and =
tightened them up a bit to spec., but it didn't make any difference.  I =
checked the tie-rod end on the left side while I had the car up, and it =
was tight, but I forgot to check the right side.  Think I should get the =
balance checked anyway?

2.   This may be the same problem, or at least part of the problem in =
number 1.  When I'm just driving along there is a distinct "hum" (like =
"vvvvvvvvvvv") that sounds like tire noise.  When I turn right, no =
difference, but when I turn left hard enough to "unweight" the left side =
the noise goes away.  This, along with number 1 above makes me think =
wheel bearings, except they seem to "feel" OK, but that's only a =
semi-educated guess.  I want to try rotating the tires when I have time =
and see if the noise follows, but I'm open to any other =
ideas/suggestions.

3.   There's a pretty noticeable vibration through the clutch pedal and =
shift knob at 3300-3500 rpm's, regardless of speed or load.  Any idea =
where this may be coming from and how to fix it?

4.   The stereo is the Blaupunkt with the eq/amp which sounds great half =
the time, but sometimes the left-front just goes and starts spitting out =
static, then it'll come back just as randomly.  I pulled the unit and =
the connections aren't corroded or otherwise visibly broken, any ideas?

Sorry to be such a question hog on my first post, but I figured it's =
better than hitting everyone with four separate messages.  Thanks in =
advance.  I love the car so far...
