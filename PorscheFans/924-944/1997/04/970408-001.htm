As a reply to trivia question about coefficient of drag I think I read
somewhere that the 924 happens to have one of hte lowest COD's of all time
beating out the 944 and other cars including the smooth looking 92.  But I
may be wrong.  I also must say that my HP ratings are out of a Panorama
issue from many moons ago.  Also one advantage that a 924 has is that with
it's narrower body it can get around auto cross courses easier than those
big fat 944s.

77 924 and I am willing to sacrifice it for Boxster if someone is
desperate enough to want a turquoise (original color) 924.
