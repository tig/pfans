     -only relevant to UK list members, but I've had full alignment checks 
     and adjustments done on two cars by Pro-Align in Lawn Road, 
     Northampton.  They are the main importers for a brilliant 4-wheel 
     computerised measurement system, and offer the alignment service as a 
     sideline.  These guys are good and fast, and know Porsches.  Cost is 
     _36 for a full set of measurements, then _10 for each adjustment 
     required, so they are a fraction of the cost of a main dealer.  When I 
     was last there, I learned that they fix the cars that the main dealers 
     can't sort out.
     
     No, I don't work for them, or get commission!
     
     
     Mike

I recently had an alignment done and was charged 1.8 hours labour and 
$10.00 shop supplies for a total of $135.91 CDN which is about $96.00 US. 
They did say that it sometimes takes longer.
