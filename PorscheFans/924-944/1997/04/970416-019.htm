Hey Allen, somebody owns that dealership and they'd be delighted to hear how 
you, a Pcar owner was treated.  I think PCNA would also appreciate some input 
on how effective their dealer network is in the customer relations 
dept.....and ....the dealership owner would be thrilled to know you'd spoken 
to PCNA. 
 
I had a buddy in the 60's who got out of high school and got a good job at 
Electric Boat in Conn, as a pipefitter building Nuclear subs.  Worked a lot of 
OT, lived at home for free and saved agressively for his dream car, a new 66 
Corvette 396 roadster.  He had saved, I think, $3200 and on a nice spring 
Saturday, he and I and another friend went to the local Chevy dealer to buy a 
silver, red interior car on the showroom floor.  He had the money in his 
pocket.  The salesman copped the same attitude your Pcar guy had.  He wouldn't 
open the hood to let us view the engine, wouldn't let him sit in the car even 
though he announced his intention to buy it.  We asked for the manager and he 
explained his "policy" towards those with a champagne appetite and a nickel 
for beer. I dragged my friend out to the parts dept. where I was a familiar 
face, having spent too much of my meager income for performance parts.  The 
parts counter guy gave us the name of the owner of the dealership and we 
called him..told the story...  Met him there 30 minutes later, showed him the 
cash and went with him as he got the paperwork started and fired the sales guy 
and manager.  My friend drove the car home........ 
 
So, venting with us is ok but do it where it may do some good.........go get 
'em....... 
 
Ted
