Well my gas gauge doesn't seem to read acurately any more (it is a little low).
 I realize someone else just went through this.

I pulled the carpet and the mat from over the gas tank.  I was going to try to
clean the contacts.  Low and behold the gas tank is different than my '84 944.
 The fuel is pulled from above the engine, versus before it was pulled below.
 I envieled a few gas lines coming from the hole and going down to the engine.
 The contacts are in a sealed box.

What year did Porsche make this change, and why?
