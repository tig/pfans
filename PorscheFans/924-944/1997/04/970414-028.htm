Hi-

Well I just plain ran out of time.  Am leaving Ithaca for Santa Clara in   
10 days and the infamous 931 is still sitting in pieces in my barn.  I'm   
calling the junk man to haul it away at the end of the week, but if   
between then and now someone wants to make me an offer for any of it,   
blast away. Email me at paul_booth@vds.com or call me at 607.257.2651.

1981 924-turbo.  Complete car, but has been in the midst of an engine   
rebuild for going on 2 years now.  Powerplant is re-assembled but still   
on the engine stand.  Everything is up for grabs if we can arrange   
shipping.

Here are a few pieces that might be of special interest to a 931 owner:

4 16x6" 928-style flat rims.  2 are perfect, 2 a little chewed but
straight.  Rims are currently shod with 205/55 ZR16 Dunlop D40/M2's.

4 205/55 R16 Pirelli P210 snow tires.  Two seasons on them.  Nicest
performing snows I've ridden.

Rebuilt (but never reinstalled) KKK turbo.  Turbo-city did the rebuild.
All oil/air hoses for the turbo are latest rev's and in good shape.

931 exhaust manifold.

931 cylinder head.  One season on the camshaft.

Power bits:  working power mirrors, window motors, rear window wiper.

4-spoke Porsche steering wheel, brown leather.

Hella halogen headlamps.

etc.

Let me know....

Paul
