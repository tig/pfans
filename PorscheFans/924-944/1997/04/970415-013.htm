Marv,

        An excellent point you have made about our vehicles' decreased
desirability among thieves since their "prime" in the 80's.  You are right
that every car is still at risk since 198X Olds/GM's seem to be popular
targets even though they may not be the flashiest or fastest moving ones on

        I forgot to mention that LoJack has been shown to be somewhat
effective in deterring theft and recovery of vehicle before it gets to the
chop shop.  It's kind of expensive, but then again, so is your Porsche.
