  Well that would help explain some of the problem. The sunroof is supposed to be released only when the key is in position one, the first or 'accessory' position. In this position the roof will not go up or down but it will only retract the arms to release the roof. When in position two, the 'run' position, 2nd click, the roof should go up and down but not be able to release. The micro switches at the rear end of the motor assembly track sense the position of the sunroof and will inform the 'system' when the sunroof is closed and when the sunroof is released. The switch is responsible for stopping the motor in the closed position when the key is in position 2 and it is also responsible for sensing that the sunroof is closed and then can be released when the key is in position 1. My guess is that the switch is showing an open signal all the time so that the system does not know when the roof is closed and allows the motor to continue running and release the sunroof while in key position 2. This could be dangerous!! (or it could be a useful tool for solving tailgating problems). If the roof will not release in key position number 1 I belive that confirms my suspicion that the micro switch sensor is not telling the system that the roof is closed. Try George B., he should have the parts (used and good price) that your looking for as well as good advice.
