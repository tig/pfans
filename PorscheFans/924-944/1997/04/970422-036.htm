Hmm.  On my car, it's located at the base of the driver's side door
support thingy, above the running board.  But my paint code is also
located conveniently right next to the dash cables under the hood, so I
guess it's different for a 944.

Anyway, I think it's required someplace: it lists the GVWR and GVAR, along
with maximum seating capacity and weight.  It's also our assurance that
the car meets both stringent Porsche factory standards and US emissions
and safety standards.

I can't believe they replaced it, if they did.
