Barry Lenoble already posted on the trans cooler being an option,
but the all knowing George B. puts more light on the subject with
this bit of info:

I think the important thing about George's note is that apparently the
cooler on the '86, even though an option, was apparently on many of those
cars.

Thanks to Barry and George for their clarification of my post stating
that the cooler was not standard equipment on the '86 951.
