     Ezra, Jerry, George, Tony, Dan, John,(others I might have missed)  
     
     Thanks for the suggestions on fixing the fan switch (88 944S).  I'm 
     going to start with Jerry's (below), then move on to buying used if 
     needed.  I also attached another reply that didn't CC everyone.

     What you have going out on you is the blower motor resistor.  I had 
     mine go out last summer at Mid-Ohio during the IndyCar event.  Sunny, 
     98 degrees outside  with a black leather interior and my A/C on the 
     fritz.  Wasn't fun. Now the skinny.  Thought my problem was the 
     climate control unit, but they normally don't go bad.  The blower 
     motor resistor is part no. 944.616.101.00. OEM new will run you 
     $211.37 (Beaudry Porsche) or used at Parts Heaven for $20.00.  I went 
     used and thought I could go thru ten for the price of one.   The 
     switch is located under the black plastic shroud in between the 
     battery and fuse box in the engine compartment.  Carefully lift off 
     the plastic blower motor shroud and your will see a 4" long cable plug 
     going into a 5"long white ceramic flat on the right hand side.  There 
     are two screws that hold the resistor in.  It seems that high speed 
     (#4) is the default for the only on speed and the power is stepped 
     down for the other three.  The theory is the ceramic plate holds the 
     stepdown coils in the airflow of the blower motor to cool them as they 
     get quite hot when you add resistance to slow the fan (See old 
     PorscheFans posts about meltdown of Headlight switches on early 944's 
     when you dim the dashlights while driving for hours and build up all 
     of that resistor heat.)
     The resistor is easy to replace and should take about 30 minutes max.
     
     >        Oh yeah, anybody have a spare Air-Conditioning switch (has 
     the >snowflake on it) for the dash on an '86 951?  Are they

     My snowflake has worn off, and I'd like to replace it, but an earlier 
     post or an article in Excellence had made me aware, if I am not 
     mistaken, that the switch alone is in the range of $150-200 plus the 
     time to wire the climate control system.  Once again, there is no 
     "easy" fix. Let me know if someone out there has a better solution.
     
     Good Luck!

     Had the same problem on my 86 944
     The resistor pack is on the  top of drivers side heating/ cooling fan 
     Case.
     Mine has a 3 inch black plug held by two screws, the base is white.  
     IT is
     in the cooling system to keep it cool !!
     
     I would check the pack ( as u said u would like to do the maintenance 
     yourself) because it could be only one wire that may need soldering.  
     As the pack is suspended coil resistors and the connections rust.  Or 
     the actual connector plug could be loose and need reconnecting.
     
     But once u see the problem u should have no problem solving it but if 
     u do just e-mail me with specifics and I will help as I allready had 
     to trouble shoot mine with no books..
     
     If it needs replacing try ecology@juno.com for used parts that is 
     where I go  George is very good..

Ted,
    If you don't find a used resistor pack, or want to repair yours, let
me know. I can look up the values in my factory workshop manuals, and it 
would be a simple matter to order replacements. You could determine the 
required resistor wattages by removing the resistor pack and inspecting 
the resistors on it. Or, I could make some quick back of the envelope 
calculations using the blower current draw & resistor values...  In any 
event, I suggest you remove the resistor pack and see if that is what 
blew.  It could also be your switch..
     
Good Luck.
