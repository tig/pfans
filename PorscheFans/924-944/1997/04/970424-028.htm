<< Could you give me the exact physical location of the suspect connector on
 the 89 Turbo?


 
 This sounds like some preventative maintenance that can easily be done in
 advance.  My car has had a lot of dirt accumulate over its previous owner's
 life.  I have since cleaned the engine bay, but there is a higher chance
 for problems like the one discussed to rear their ugly head when large
 volumes of dirt and grease infiltrates throughout the engine.
  >>
This is the connector on the throttle body. If you activate the accelerator
pedal a shaft rotates and activates the throttle body butterfly valve. One
end of the shaft is attached to the accelerater cable and the other goes thru
the throttle body and activates the throttle position switch which is the
usual culprit. Or as I stated the connection to that switch is susually the
culprit. If this is as clear as mud maybe someone can describe it a bit
better. My car isn't home so I can't do the description justice.
