Aside from the odometer being broken, these cars demand to be driven if
they are to survive.  What are you saving it for!  Enjoy it!  Gas will go
stale under long term storage and cause varnish deposits in the fuel
system, causing all sorts of running problems.  Lifters tend to stick and
collapse under storage.  Driving keeps them pumped up.  Belts dry out and
get stiff when sitting.  Same with engine seals and gaskets.  They need
heat and oil to stay supple, or they will dry out and shrink.  Run the AC,
or the compressor seal will shrink and leak freon.  Tires will flat spot
from sitting, and get crusty from non-use.

The car should be driven at least 10 miles at a time to ensure that 
everything gets up to operating temperature, and the oil has had a chance 
to circulate to the tiny crevices, like the lifters.  Shorter trips will 
not heat the engine oil hot enough to cause moisture condensation to 
vaporize, causing water accumulation in the oil.  Same with the exhaust 
system.  It will rot if condensed moisture is not burned off.

Someone a long time ago stated their 911 Turbo's manual specifically said
to drive the car hard occasionally.  I can't verify the information, but I
did take the advice.  ;-)

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.  Daily driver in Eugene, OR.
