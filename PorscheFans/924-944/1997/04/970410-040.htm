About three week ago I sent a message to the list concerning a cooling
problem on my '86 944. Thanks to all who responded both personally and to
the list. 

I thought I recap and pass along what I found out.The car is a '86 944
with 84K. I'm the third owner. The POers generally took good care of the
car. The second owner had service done at an established local shop. I
bought the car with 68K on the odo. At 70K I had the timing and balance 
belts replaced by the same shop. It was a just in time repair because the
balance belt was actually broken. I heard a noise and had it
investigated. The water pump, seals, etc were not replaced as they were
in good condition according to the shop. 

I've had the car about a year and one half. Its my daily driver. The
temperature gauge has always stayed at the first mark on the dial. When
it would start to rise, such as when idling in traffic, the fans would
come on and bring it back down. to the mark or a little above. 

About three weeks ago I  noticed that the gauge was starting to creep up
and sit around the second mark. There was no coolant loss or noise to
indicate a bad water pump, and so far as I could tell the fans were
operating normally.  However even at highway speeds the temperature gauge
stayed up.  When driving in town, it was hard to tell whether the fan
were operating properly, temperatures have been in the 40's to 70's here
so cooling loads were low. The fans seemed to be operating on low at
times when the temperature was up near the second mark, and when the car
was parked after driving enough to bring the gauge up to the second mark
the fans would usually come on at high speed for a minute or two. 

The first week I checked the fan operation and tried to determine by
restricting the upper hose if I was getting good coolant flow. The fans
seem to operate OK, but not quite as I expected. The coolant flow test
were sort a inconclusive because I didn't really know what to look for. I
attempted to bleed the system of air, but was getting mostly steam when I
attempted it. 

By the end of the first week, I'd decided that the fans and pump were ok
and either I had a bad gauge or a failing thermostat. The local dealer
had the thermostat, but not the gaskets to go with it. I ordered from
Auto Atlanta and waited. During the second week my problem got a little
worse, the gauge would start to creep to the second mark and go above it
if I sat in traffic. Reving the engine would bring the gauge down some. I
drove the car sparingly.

I got the thermostat and gaskets last Friday and went into mechanic mode
on Saturday. If you haven't tried this the working space is tight, tight,
tight. If you've got big hand - forget it and let someone else do the
work. I removed the hose from the water pump and re moved the distributor
cap, just placed it on top of the engine, wires intact, to get working
room. Then I went looking for snap ring pliers. I bought a set of
Craftsman with prongs held in by screws. Luckily the snap ring was at the
bottom of the water pump outlet, but because of the design I could not
get them to engage the holes in the snap ring. I tried a set from the
local Auto Zone that had interchangeable heads and with these I could
engage the holes in the snap ring and compress it some but not enough to
remove the snap ring. All this is done working blind. With the pliers and
you hand in place its hard to see any thing that your doing.  The trips
to the auto parts store and attempts to use the pliers consumed all of
Saturday. About 6 PM I put everything back together and decided to take
it to a shop! Let the deal with it.

On Monday I was no longer speaking in tongues and foaming at the mouth so
I decided to give it one more try. During my lunch hour I cruised the
mechanics shops near where I worked looking for a Snap-On truck or some
other tool supplier. I figure I just needed a better set of snap ring
pliers. The second set would engage the ring , but there was too much
flex in the pivot of the plier to hold the ring steady long enough to
pull it out. I found a Cornwell tool supplier and bought a set of snap
ring pliers from him. The Cornwell part is ML 34-45 - $15.00.  This set
has a rigid pivot point and bigger prongs than any I was able to find at
the auto part store. 

I didn't get a chance to work on the car again till Wednesday evening.
But within 20 minutes after starting from scratch, I had the thermostat
out. Removing the gasket behind the thermostat was a pain because it was
so old it fell apart and came out in pieces. Working blind and checking
with a mirror, I spent about an hour getting the gasket out. The new rear
gasket I got from AA would not fit in the inner part of the pump - the
diameter of the gasket was too large. The part number on the gasket was
95110615500. I figure its for a 951 type replacement pump - the upgrade
everyone advertises and I had the original pump.A this point I wasn't
about to stop so I installed the thermostat without the rear gasket. So
far as I can tell the rear gasket was to prevent  coolant from leaking by
the thermostat and direct it though the heater loop to promote fast
heater warmup. I put every thing back together, bled the system and drove
the car today. The thermostat I received from AA was an 80 C and the one
I replace was an 83. The temperature gauge is now staying on the first
mark, rising above it occasionally when stopped in traffic. The fans seem
to be operating normally.

Here is what I think was going on. The thermostat was failing,
restricting flow back to the radiator. (BTW, I tested the thermostat in
boiling water and I could not see that it was opening at all.) Because
the flow was restricted, the temperature stayed up at highway speeds i e,
the hot coolant was not getting to the radiator in sufficient quantity to
bring the gauge down. The fans were not operating properly because the
radiator temperature sensor was not seeing the coolant temperature
present in the engine. When the engine was stopped, the coolant equalized
and the high temperature water reached the radiator through a reverse
path or the radiator temperature went up because there was no air flow.
In any case the radiator fans came on at high speed and cooled the water
in the radiator. 

Other things I noticed. When I tried to bleed the system before I replace
the thermostat I could get air out through the bleed valve, but by the
time coolant started to come out I was so hot it flashed to steam. After
I changed the thermostat I got a good coolant flow when I bled the
system. 

Several questions. Which way does the coolant flow? I assume it flows out
past the thermostat and into the bottom of the radiator.

 Second,what distinguishes the original '86 pump. The one on my car has
what looks like a white plastic outlet on the front of the pump. 

Third, any thought about leaving the rear gasket out. I can't really
decide how the flow goes to the heater. What I consider the return comes
into the pump between the top and bottom of the thermostat. Anyone know
how this is supposed to work? I guess hot water from the engine flows
into the heater and returns to the water pump, but until the thermostat
opens it seems flow would be restricted. Is there another bypass back
into the engine? 

Fourth, I use what I had in the way of anti-freeze, Prestone. Any
recommendations? I know how to change it pretty fast now. 

One last comment. I'm about 15,000 miles into the 30K life of the belts.
If the water pump last that long, and if someone confirms that it is the
original one, I think I'll change it when the belts are serviced.

Sorry this is so long, just thought it might help someone else and I
needed to get it said.
