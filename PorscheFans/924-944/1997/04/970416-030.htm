I had to retire my '84 944 when I broke the timing belt at Bridgehampton
last year. It served me well for 10 years and 120K miles with over 100
autocrosses and at least 10 PCA driver's ed events. But you can almost
set the clock on the fact that the timing belt will break at the worst
possible moment if you do not replace it before 60K miles! 

Since rumor had it that the Bridge was not going to be in business this
year, I have been biding my time before picking up a suitable
replacement vehicle.

Well, the word is in and the Bridge is still in business until Labor
Day! So now I have this unbelievable desire to get back out there. If
you haven't driven this course, CONTACT THE METRO NY PCA CHAPTER RIGHT
NOW!!!! 

Short of finding a 911 or Boxster to rent by the day (I'd have to build
a custom rollbar for the Boxster!?!!), I'm in the market for a Turbo S.
I'd consider a 944 Turbo with a LSD, but I really like to have the M030
suspension as well. If any of you PorscheFans know where one can be had
in good condition for a fair price, please let me know ASAP! I will
travel anywhere in the US for the right car!!!

Thanks in advance,

Paul Foster

BTW, George Beuselinck still has my old car. It is still sitting there
waiting for some lucky individual to come along and get a great bargain.
It would make a wonderful low-bucks SCCA ITS or PCA racecar!
