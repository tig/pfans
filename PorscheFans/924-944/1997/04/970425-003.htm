I don't notice much difference, but I think the AC is supposed to go into a
standby mode when you hit the gas so you get the needed power when
requested.

Yes, there is a kit (I think the bracket is about $200) to circumnavigate
the AC compressor.  You need that kit and a shorter belt to go to the
alternater only.  The kit provides a means of belt tensioning in the
absence of the AC as that is where the belt is tensioned now.  I think
there was a short article in Excellence that outlined this procedure and
the Porsche part numbers for the conversion.

The only problem for you to do that is you should run the AC to get the
juices flowing in the system and lubricate the compressor on a regular
basis to prevent the seals from leaking the coolant away.  If you by-pass
the AC you run the risk of possible AC deterioration for the next season.
