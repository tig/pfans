Hey dudes,

Well, this weekend's auto-x went a lot better than Kent.  Actually, if
it weren't for a pesky 450hp Mustang (with upper and lower control arm
suspension conversion), it would have been a clean Porsche sweep of the
top three fastest times.

The course was quite low speed, but if you got the line right, things
became a lot straighter and faster.  It was one of these courses where
you bring the car out to the far sides of the course and then sort of
cross over in the center.  The first lap was a figure-8, the next an
hour glass.

Of the Porsche dudes out, we had Paul in his 89 944T, me in my 89 944T,
Lou in his 89 944T, Wes in his 91 944S2, Kelly in his 944S, Harry
in his 89 911 Carrera and a husband and wife team in a 95 993.

First one out of the 944 group was Wes.  He turned a time of 66, but
missed part of the course and DNF'ed.  Next up was me on the Hoosiers.
I left the line hard and ended up almost killing myself and a few
spectators as the car started to snake back and forth.  I was totally
out of control, or so I thought, because I ended up somehow going in
the general direction of the course and made it through the first few
gates, under boost and sliding around.  I finally got it into second
and things calmed down a bit.  I realized I didn't leave any squashed
spectators behind and felt better.  That run was a 71.144 clean.
Paul then went up (first time on Kumhos) and clicked off a 72.4??.  Both
of us felt that the tires needed some breaking in as both cars felt
really greasy.  Lou went out and got lost on the cours and DNF'ed.

At this point of the event, my 71.144 was the fastest of the day.  Next
rounds, I went up before Paul and ran a 70.490 which was now the new
fastest time.  Paul went up and ran a 71.0?? on his next run and said
the tires felt much better as he got used to them, he says they feel
very much like an RSII Yoky.  Wes in his ever fast S2 went out and ran
a 68.???, but hit the stop box cone so his run was technically a DNF.
Lou got an 80 second time (he was running on Comp T/A M&S tires!)

By this run, my FTD was gone as a Mustang with a 450hp supercharged
engine and full custom suspension (upper and lower control arms!) was
in first at 68.7??.  Paul went up for his third timed run and got a
very quick 68.923.  The pressure was now on, I had to produce :)  I
went out and quickly turned my wipers on as I reached down to shift
gears and managed to spray the windshield with fluid too!  I ended up
leaving the damn wipers on through the run.  I was not happy about
wasting all that time fumbling with the wiper stalk, but to my
surprise, the time was a 68.922.  Wes went out and finally got a clean
non-DNF run with a stunning 67.8??.  So, out of the timed runs, the
times were as follows:

Driver		Time		Car		Tire
Wes Shew	67.8??		91 944S2	BFG R1
Alex D		68.7??		Mustang	BFG R1
Farzaan	68.922		89 944T	Hoosier
Paul		68.923		89 944T	Kumho
Johnny		69.9??		80 Turbo T/A	Yokohama

Paul and I called it quits then, but some people still took a fun run.
In the fun run, Wes and Alex both went fast, with Wes's time being a 
67.4?? and Alex went down to 68.4??.

I'm surprised how well the turbos did in this relatively slow speed event.
I'm anxiously waiting for the first regional down here.  The organizers
are trying to make it really fast.

For people following the tire comparisons.  Paul gives the Kumhos a huge
thumbs up.  While my Hoosiers showed about a 10-15% wear rate at this
event, Paul's Kumhos didn't show any wear at all.  I think both Paul and I
will be running the Kumhos in the future.  Paul liked them so much that
he's going to order a new set of fronts in the next couple of days to
augment the good condition rears.

Farzaan.
