First of all I'd like to thank everyone for their replies while trying to
get my 944 to pass the new GA emissions.  I took the advice and just
replaced the O2 sensor and it passed.  I did called the dealer (Jim Ellis
in Atlanta) and the guy there told me they could probably adjust it but it
still might need the sensor and I was probably looking at 2 hours shop
time.  Knowing in advance the CO's at idle were fine (but just couldn't
recover with 30 seconds) and the car runs perfect, I didn't see the need
for the dealer to spend two hours adjusting it only then to tell me it
needs an oxygen sensor.  Plus I like doing as much as I can myself.  But
anyway, thanks for everyones input.

ps ... can we drop the "blinker fluid" thread already.  i know i'm new here
and it was funny at first but now its getting tired - plus it was a major
pain last night when the net is jammed, trying to download the archive page
when its that big.  it wouldn't be that bad if the digest list worked but
as a network engineer myself, i'm well aware of server upgrades and the
time and money it takes to do these things.  : )
