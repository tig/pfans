What, precisely, are the symptoms of head gasket problems?  Is there a way
that you could tell without having to, say, take apart the entire engine
and do measurements (well, if it's bad, you don't have to measure)?

I'm starting to get depressed about my car again.  It's starting to seem
like as soon as I get about $300 of work done, it's back in the shop
again.  Fortunately, that's just how I feel -- not the reality of the
situation -- but it'd really top things off if I had to go through a damn
engine rebuild.  (But if anyone can find a reputable engine-rebuilding
place that only charges $300...)
