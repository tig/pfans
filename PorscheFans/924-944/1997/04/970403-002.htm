Hey Carl,
I'm having a partial paint job done on my car right this minute.  
Unfortunately, my car is black so we can only hope for the best.  On the 
bright side, my guy is using factory Sikkens paint.  We're doing the 
driver's fender, driver's door, entire driver's side body back to the 
seam joint in the rear, both side view mirrors, and replacing ALL stone 
guards.  My guy says right up front that, short of a proper whole-car 
respray, there's not much hope of a perfect partial.  He will, however, 
do his best to rub out the rest of the car.  Frankly I'm quite 
optomistic.  A couple keys items you'll notice are respraying the side 
view mirrors (badly stone chipped after 317,000 miles) and replacing the 
stone guards all the way around.  These steps should go a long way to 
freshen the overall look.  I'm considering Colgan mirror bras but I want 
to avoid a cheesy look.  Please e-mail me to find out how it turns out.  
I should have it back by Saturday.  

What do other people think of mirror bras?
