I recently replaced the tires on my '87 944 Turbo with Dunlop D40M2s.  =
Since then, the car hasn't had the 'on-center' feel it had before.  It =
tends to follow road grooves and irregularities.  I've checked the ball =
joints, tie-rod ends, and wheel bearings and all is well there.  =
Alignment was done a year ago.  One thing I've noticed though.....

If I place my knee on the top of either front tire and apply force, I =
can feel some play in the lateral direction in both front wheels. This =
is with weight on the wheel of course.  I don't think this is normal.  =
Is this a sign of worn struts?  The play is there also with weight off =
the wheels and struts fully extented, but I had felt that was normal =
with the struts fully extented.

If I have to replace the struts, does anyone have any recommended Koni =
suppliers.  Any extra parts I should replace at that time like turnstile =
bearings, etc?  A detailed procedure would be helpful, but it doesn't =
look that hard. (Hey, I replaced my own motor mounts!)

Thanks for any advice! =20
And Jim Richmond, keep those stories coming!
