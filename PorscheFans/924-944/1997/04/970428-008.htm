Yes, it does work. My understanding is that it functions by decreasing the
surface tension of the water, promoting better contact between the water and
the heat exchanger. Kind of makes me wonder if a little laundry detergent
wouldn't accomplish the same thing.

You can now buy the stuff at Pep Boys for about $6.

There is some stuff on the net about it but I lost the URL.

If you have more than a 30% mix of antifreeze / water in the system, you should
take care of that before doing anything else. Antifreeze significantly reduces
the heat transfer capacity of the coolant and doesn't offer a significant increase
in the boiling point, so running a 50/50 mix is a bad idea unless the weather
demands it.
