While this is clearly sound advice, please bear in mind that 944:s
owners manuals are printed between 1983 and 1991. This will also mean
that recommendations of, say 1986 (1987 model year), will not take into
account what have happened between today and date of printing... 

I think that *extra* oil additives are unneccesary (at best) and may
even be detrimental (sometimes). However, I also believe that synthetic
oils and new additives may give good reason to reevaluate wich oil to
choose.
