I think Andial's comments are correct.  When I tried the latest Autothority,
the car felt very, very rich.  Now, I don't have the instrumentation hooked
up yet so I could only assume it was running really rich, but it looks like
Andial found out it was actually the timing bumped too high.  The car feels
"un-natural".  That is a stupid description, but it's the best I can think
of.  It feels like the engine is not supposed to be accelerating like that
at low RPM and feels like it's not supposed to be run that way, almost like
the chips are forcing it to.

*but*, I'd rather have a "fat" feeling chip than to run stock boost :)

On another note, Christopher, be careful running stock chips with the 2.8L
motor, it may run lean.  There are some things you can do to the stock setup
that will allow a bit richer mixture without inflicting any of the side
effects of running the aftermarket chips.  Email me.
