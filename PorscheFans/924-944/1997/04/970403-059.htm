This is very good advice!!!

Everyone should know about it.  I only use my training bras for highway
travel and when I get dressed up for nights on the town.  A properly
adjusted bra will look sharp, but never, never let it get wet and leave it
on.  Even moisture (dew) from sitting overnight will ruin you paint!!!

Take heed.
