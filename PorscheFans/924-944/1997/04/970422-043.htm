I am having a problem with my A/C switch.  It won't stay depressed and will
actually pop out of the dash into the passenger seat.  I looked behind the
face of the button and it looked like I was missing a lever.  George
Beuselinck generously provided me with a replacement lever (which is made
from white plastic and is smaller than a grain of rice- each end also has a
groove cut into it).  I replaced the lever, but it hasn't solved the problem.
        I was wondering if anyone knew what I could try next.  The white
lever spins freely on its pin, but it seems that it doesn't catch after
being depressed, and it doesn't "reset" itself when the button is released:
in other words, the lever (starting in a vertical orientation) will spin 90
degrees (to horizontal) as it hits and clears the plastic, but then it stays
horizontal throughout the entire throw of travel each time the button is
depressed thereafter.  I must be missing a spring or another piece that
makes the lever flip back to vertical behind the plastic lip (to catch the
button and maintain A/C function without the pressure of your finger to hold
the button in).  Does anyone have any idea of what I'm describing?  I'm at a
loss as to how to fix this darn thing, and summer is just around the corner.
Has anyone ever had the face of their button off and looked inside?  All I
need is a description of what I'm missing- "it" should be directly behind
the lever if my R. Goldberg instincts are correct.  Thanks...
