I just completed a long list of repairs to my '86 944  ('87 engine).
Without going into too many details, I cleaned associated components,
and replaced:
o Cam Shaft race and seals
o Balance Shaft Races and seals (including those little clear ones)
o Crankshaft/Oil Pump seals
o Oil Pan gasket (oh what fun that was)
o Oil Cooler seals
o valve guide seals ( <10$ in supplies to make my own tools for this)
o Camshaft housing gasket
o Water Pump Gasket
o Cam Belt Rollers and sprockets
o Balance Shaft Rollers and sprockets
o All Belts
o Dist Cap and Rotor
o Cleaned Power Steering system inside and out, trimmed seams on
reservoir, replaced clamps, no more leaks evident
o Left and Right tie rod ends
o left and right alloy control arm ball joints
o Front Rotors
o Front Bearings
o Front Brake Pads
o Air Filter
o Oil Filter
o Oil 
o Coolant
o A/C o-rings at condensor and compressor (system was empty when I
purchased the vehicle last fall. Recharge TBD)
o I am sure I left out many items, but the above were the major ones.. 

While I was replacing the valve guide seals, I decided to do a simple
leakdown test. I have a compression testor, so I used the hose and
fittings from that to attach my Sears brand spare tire compressor to the
spark plug hole. With the camshaft removed, and the flywheel lock
installed, the max pressure this low CFM compressor would reach was
~20PSI. It sounded like the air was leaking out of the exhaust valve. I
checked cylinders #1 and #2, with identacle results, and didn't bother
to check #3 and #4. Is this acceptable? My valve guides and/or valve
stems are worn as there is some play with the springs removed. The old
valve guide seals were worn (used to have black exhaust at startup).
What is a good leakdown test? The workshop manuals are of no help, they
only specify physical tolerance limits. I plan to re-build the head this
comming winter, and would like some advice as to the dangers, if any, of
running it as is until then.

  Also, as I was re-assembling the engine last night (had an alignment
appointment this AM I didn't want to miss) I had some confusion as to
what to do for priming or otherwise pressurizing the oil lubrication
system prior to first startup. My factory workshop manuals don't say to
do anything. I used assembly lube.  The Haynes manual says to remove
spark plugs, disconnect coil, and crank engine until oil pressure
registers on the oil pressure meter. I tried this many times, even tried
pouring oil into oil cooler and crankcase through the oil filter mount,
oil pressure relief valve hole, etc..  I had no luck, and finally
decided to give starting a try. I squirted oil on the camshaft, put the
spark plugs back in, and reconnected everything. Started the engine, and
within two seconds, had full oil pressure. One of the valves was fairly
noisy. As the engine warmed up, or maybe as the lifters filled with oil,
and assembly lube was washed away, the clicking went away. It has not
re-appeared in the two times I started it since then. (The vehicle is
still at the dealer, alignment is done, including ride height leveling,
can't wait to pick it up!) What is the recommended procedure for the
next time I have to do this? I was concerned I would do damage..

  Also, how much engine vibration is normal? I definetely have less now
that I did the above repairs, but it still seems like too much. I
aligned the harmnic balancers correctly. The resonant freq, or a
harmonic thereof, is most felt between ~3k and 4K RPMs. At least it is
now better than it was before I worked on it..

Thanks for any advice!
