<pre>
I have the following items from my old 924 available for immediete
pick-up in Pittsburgh, PA:
Rear Hatch w/rear wiper
Door glass for both sides
Rear taillight assemblies
Rear side marker lights
2 wheels (4 bolt alloy painted white) w/ okay tires
Black hatch cover assembly (The thing that rolls out over your cargo area)
All of the above can be yours for $65 if you come to pick it up.  I'd
really prefer to sell it all together and I'd also really prefer to not
have to ship it.

I've also got:
4 Advent 4.6i's - Fit in rear perfectly and in front doors with holes
cut. Origionally $75/pair
Take 'em all for $30  I don't see any reason not to ship these if you
pay the shipping.

Please reply via e-mail (not through the list, please) or call me at
412.683.5729
Again I am in Pittsburgh so if you want any of the parts it would help
if you're near western PA.
Take care,
Matt


Ps: Everything listed above is in good working order.  It's not in
PERFECT condition but it all works just fine.  Hovever, because these
prices are really low I'm selling everything as is - come and see for
yourself that it's all in good shape.
