Regarding wheels and tires, having tires that are smaller than OEM will
help with gearing (particularly when autocrossing). Just check the rules
and make sure they allow you to run non-OEM-sized tires in the class you
are going to enter. I'd put 225-50x15s all the way around. I ran them
for years on 7&8x15s. The only problem I had was with the Golden Gate
Region of PCA. They reclassed my stock car to run with full-blown
racecars since they weren't the OEM size of 215-60x15!!! The SCCA allows
any size tire in the stock classes as long as it fits inside the wheel
wells (a much better rule in my opinion.)

Regarding CV joints, that clicking sound indicates you have a bad one
(or 2 or 3 or 4)...

Regarding lowering, the front is lowered by replacing the springs or by
adjustment (if you have the M030 option). The rear is lowered by
reindexing the torsion bars and/or by using the adjustment for bumper
height. In your case, look for non-OEM springs on the front struts.

Good luck with your events!
