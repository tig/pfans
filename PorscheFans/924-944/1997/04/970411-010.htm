Something is going wrong with your clutch :-(

Either your hydraulics are going bad (clutch master or slave cylinder)
or your clutch release lever has broken (don't laugh, I've seen this
happen before, right John?), or your rubber center or spring center
clutch has broken.

There's nothing wrong with parking in reverse.

Most likely, your clutch slave cyl is starting to go bad. Do you
have any brake fluid leaking into the car? It would be by the clutch
pedal. If so, your clutch master is shot. If not, do you have any
wetness on or near the starter? If so, the clutch slave cyl is probably
on it's way out. Not that uncommon. Not that difficult (or expensive)
to fix. Next time it happens, try pumping the clutch pedal a few times.

If you can't find any leaks in the hydraulics, then it might be the
clutch itself. That is bad, as it either takes a LONG time or a LOT
of money to replace the clutch.

Good luck,
