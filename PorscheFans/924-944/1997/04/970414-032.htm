Thanx Mike 

    The non-digest mode is how I get  the posts  from 944 only  all the
rest work in digest form.

I re-up  every week  in hopes that they fixed the digest and or their
server software as they said  they would by the end of March.

I love this  medium  but  the individual  messages  are too much.
I prefer the digest.   It used to work.

Thank-you for you polite response and work-around solution.

I got another suggestion  that says  I am an ingrate (they used a
different set of words)  this however is far from the truth as this 
list has caused me great pleasure   akin  to getting letters from a
freind. My response  was to help same.

                          Sir   / Ed
