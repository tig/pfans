Well guys, I kept searching the web for an acceptable alternative to freon
and  found a classified ad for a like new Snap-On vacuum pump, manifold set,
and leak detector ...and 30 cans of R-12, at a couple hundred dollars less
than the freon alone would cost me here in Phoenix. I figure this should
last me about ten years, even if I purge the system once a year. So my freon
alternative search is over for a while.

I also found a neat site for those of you who would like to be able to
purchase R-12, R-134a, or just about any other kind of coolant, to do your
own A/C repairs.  http://www.epatest.com

At this website you can download the EPA section 609 manual free, take the
test online for under $10, and print out an instant temporary EPA
certification certificate, if you pass the test. The actual certification
card is mailed in about 30 days.  

Also found a site selling Sun freon recycling stations (new still in the
box) model A9950 for $987. They are supposed to list at over $3,200. if
anyone is interested I will e-mail them the website.
