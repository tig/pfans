Chris,

Oil in that tube is not unusual and I doubt that you would inspect many
cars without a trace of oil there. I've been seeing it in mine for many
thousands of miles now. I think it is more likely that you are sucking
oil through the valve seals, assuming the rest of the engine is in good
shape.

Of course if you are literally spewing oil into the intercooler, and it
is pooling at the bottom of the intercooler (a dental mirror will show
you that), you are probably in the market for a new turbo.
