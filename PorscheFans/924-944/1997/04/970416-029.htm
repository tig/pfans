Weight of the fuel tank isn't that much...

LPG does have lower energy than gasoline, but that mainly means that you
get a lower milage on LPG than you would on gasoline (that's not a real
problem since LPG is about 30 $cents instead of $1.10 for gasoline !!!).

There is a minor power decrease, but that's not a real problem either,
since there will be a switch on the dashboard that will simply switch back
to gasoline in an instant. So when I am at a traffic light and another
Porsche comes near (or some wannabe-fast guy in a wannabe-fast car)... off
I go !

Anyway, I haven't installed (or even bought) it yet... I'm just thinking
about it and wondered wether there are others with experience with it.
However, I guess there will not be anyone in the US considering the
gas-prices over there ! :)
