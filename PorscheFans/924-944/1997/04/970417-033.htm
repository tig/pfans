Like Barry, I also own an Alpine White '89 944 Turbo; I agree with
everything he said about it. I looked for this car for more than six months
before I found one, and when it came along, I snapped it up immediately --
I put a deposit down an hour after I saw the car and picked it up the next
day. I know for a fact that several other people were ready to buy my car,
so they don't stay on the market long.

Luckily, mine was in excellent condition: low mileage, perfect
body/interior, strictly-dealer maintained, and clutch, water pump, and
timing belt recently done.

Prices range from around $15k to $25k. With the 'S' cars I've found that
the owners either (a) take very good care of them, or (b) race them and/or
drive them very hard. [These conditions are not necessarily mutually
exclusive.] Because these cars offer incredible performance while being
very easy to drive, they're popular on the track.

I also looked at 968s but decided that I wanted a 951S because of the extra
power, larger brakes, and suspension goodies.

I agree -- the paper won't be much help. Read Pano, and if you have friends
in other PCA regions across the country, enlist their help -- assuming
you're willing to travel. I found my car with Classifieds 2000, one of the
better on-line used car sites. They have a service which will notify by
e-mail when a car meeting your criteria shows up in their listings.

Good luck. If I come across any advertisements I'll forward them to the list.
