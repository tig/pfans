The outside diameter is smaller, but more importantly, the wheel is much
thicker.  I currently have a Momo Monte Carlo F1.  In the very near future,
I will be changing to a Momo Champion.  I love the F1, but it looks to have
been bent somewhere in its life.  I didn't notice this until I compared
it to Paul's Monte Carlo which is relatively new.  Darren put a Momo Shuttle
on his car and loves it.  Hey Darren, describe the difference you felt.

I just notice that the stock steering wheel is too big and hampers having
fun.  The slightly smaller (350mm) wheel with the thicker padding just makes
it a lot easier to maneuver and improves the feel.
