Hot or cold, it is a 15 minute job to get both races out of a single hub.
Use a brass drift, not a hard steel punch, to avoid digging furrows into
the hub and/or chipping the race. A heavy hammer and safety glasses are the
only other tools you'll need. Just work your way around the diameter of the
race to keep from getting it cocked in the hub, especially when putting the
new ones in. I applied a light coat of WD40 to the surface of the hub and
this seemed to help things slide a little better.

I punched one set out cold, then heated the other one. It made a slight
difference on both removal and replacement and is probably worth the trouble.
