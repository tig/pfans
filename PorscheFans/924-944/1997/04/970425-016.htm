I like my Michelin XGT-V4 tires (215/60/15/VR rated)...

they are M+S, so I am getting excellent tread wear and durability out of
them... they are hard enough to where I think they would resist most OOR
conditions, and they seem to grip pretty good, though I do think they let
go a bit quicker than a softer compund... I admit, I did not like them at
first, and thought my tire dealer did me wrong, (I still think they were
lazy, M+S tires on a Porsche? but it's working out fine...) I came from
moutainbike and motorcycles and this was the first car I've owned in a
while, so my consumer educational level was not up to snuff at the time...

for everyday driving, they seem quite up to the task... I'm looking at
about 30-35k miles out of them too! I have cruised 80-100mph for short
distances (20-30 miles- speeding tickets are still a real concern here in
Georgia!) and they were rock solid... I cruise at an extended 80mph often
(we have some 70mph highways just outside of the city) and they are totally
fine...

If you need more aggression, I think they make a non M+S version
called "XGT V4 sport" which I will take a good look at and will probably
get if the word on the tread life is close to 30k miles... on my
motorcycle, I was replacing 2 $150 tires every 6k miles, so these Michelins
are mileage heaven...

I think the softer tires have more of a problem with OOR, and if the car
does extended sitting, it's probably best to take the wheels off... I
wanted Pirelli P6 tires when I was shopping, but the Michelins were $35
cheaper per tire...

on rotation- this could be the culprit... I waited too long to rotate my
tires (9k miles- please send flames to design@mindspring.com) and I got
wobble at 70mph... I drove around like this for 2k miles and got sick of my
hand twitching on the highway, so I put them back and they are again wobble
free and straight tracking...

how often should you rotate new tires? every 3k miles?

oh well, this is just my experience...
