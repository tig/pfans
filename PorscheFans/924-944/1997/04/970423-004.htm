Ezra, 

The area where I see oil seeping out is close to the power steering pump.  If 
you were standing in front of the car, you would find the area to the right of 
the power steering pump.  It is a metal piece held on by 5 bolts and is 
between the PS pump and the engine (i don't remember, but there may be 
something between this unit and the engine).  Of the 5 bolts, one bolt is 
facing the front of the car and the other four bolts go in a direction 
perpendicular to the first one towards the engine.  I don't know if this is 
the actual source of the leak.  It was the highest point that I could make 
out.
Unfortunately, I could not identify this part in the parts catalog.

How high up is the oil cooler?

| William,
|        From what you describe, it sounds like a leak from the infamous
| oil cooler. (I assume when you say to the left of the oil cooler, you
| were standing in front of the vehicle, and meant your left which is the
| right side of the engine.)  Before I write more, can you provide a more
| detailed description? The oil cooler cover is on the right side of the
| engine, to the rear of the power steering pump, below the exhaust
| manifold. It is boxy, and has a heat shield held on by two bolts. It is
| probably covered with oil from oil changes when the oil filter dumps all
| over the place.
| 
| Good Luck,
