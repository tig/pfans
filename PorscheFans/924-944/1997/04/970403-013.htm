someone wrote a post earlier and it mentioned split fire plugs.  i personally dont care which plugs anyone uses but i seem to remember a thread about this sometime in november. it had to do with which plugs to use and why.  i am almost certain that as a group it was stated there was a good reason not to use the split fire plugs. anyone remember why?  also i am getting ready to replace mine, what did we decide were the ones to go with? i think they were bosch triple platinums but i am not quite sure. these are pretty expensive so i want to make sure that they are worth what i am paying.
thanks in advance,
matt
