It's interesting to note that Porsche's 911 was originally project number
901.  It appeared at the Frankfurt show as the 901, but because Peugeot
always named their cars after 3 digit numbers with central zeros, Porsche
yielded and let their 2nd masterpiece be sold under the "911" designation.
        If Porsche was willing to accommodate others then, perhaps Porsche
will also adapt their tradition of naming cars after their project #'s in
the interest of maintaining other "traditions" associated with their marque.
As we have already seen with the current 993 series and upcoming 996 model,
many Porsche enthusiasts continue to use the "911" name.  And the 986 is
better known as the "Boxster."  So even if Porsche projects go into the
thousands, the cars may still be referred to by their more familiar names
(Carrera, Boxster, Speedster, etc.) or 900-series designations.  This may
only prolong the ineveitable as more new cars are developed, but I'd rather
have a car named "Porsche 1026 RS Turbo" than one called "Porsche Interlude
VTEC," or "Porsche Donkey GT."

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
