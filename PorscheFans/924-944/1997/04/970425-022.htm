I have a turbo and you couldn't pay me to switch. Turbo lag is more of a
problem on the street or in autocrosses than it is at the track. On the
track, the turbo is awesome.

FWIW, a friend of mine has a race prepared 993, stock class, and he runs
with turbo S's. He can't believe the performance of the turbos.
