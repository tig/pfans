Terry,
      I will look at the cruise control design this weekend, and see if
there is a problem with how the cruise control electroncs sense the 
brake light voltage. I highly doubt the brake light bulbs are "zapping"
the cruise control electronics, but higher wattage bulbs could cause 
voltage droop in the system, possibly causing problems.

>ps. Does anybody know where you can get German brake light bulbs?
