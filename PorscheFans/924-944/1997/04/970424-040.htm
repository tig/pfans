Thanks for the responses on tires.  Another query though; any opinions,
anecdotal info or otherwise on which manufacturer is the best at making
tires that stay round?  My early 944 seems overly sensitive to (what I
would consider) minimal OOR condition (i.e., 1/16 or less).  My last two
sets of tires, Sumitomo and Dunlop, both developed at least one OOR which
had to be kept on the back where the slight but annoying vibration was not
as noticeable (try returning a tire with such a small amount of OOR). 
Obviously, this prevents one from utilizing tire rotation to extend tread
life.  Tire Re-balancing would sometimes help a little but not completely
(even high speed on-the-car wheel balancing), so I'm pretty sure OOR is the
culprit.  Wheel bearing have been checked, rack, etc.  Shocks/struts seem
plenty stiff but are original.  Perhaps the very communicative steering (on
all Porsches) makes them a bit more finicky in this regard as more feel
gets transmitted through to the driver by design.  If so, I would expect
others have had similar experiences.  I'm just looking for decent street
tires (no auto-X or track) that will cruise comfortably at 90 or so mph. 
Any suggestions are appreciated.
