I guess I'm a brainless driver, so is Hans Stuck and the rest of the
Porsche drivers.  LSD is a necessity when you have enough power to break
the inside rear tires loose in a corner under acceleration, simple as that.

If you don't have an LSD, the inside tire will spin and the car will lose
forward momentum, it doesn't matter what kind of drive you are, every
person with an LSD is going to bomb right by.

I am a firm believer in LSD and ABS, I feel that both provide an advantage
when used correctly.  For those people that hate ABS, you still can threshold
brake with ABS, it just takes a more sensitive foot.  Over bumps, it can be
a bit troublesome, but it's worth the trade off.

From what I remember, the Porschefan above drives a 924 and perhaps the
924 does not have enough HP to really break the inside tire loose under
cornering, but I have seen an 86 951 with no LSD and it just sits there and
smokes its inside tire when my car is moving along nicely.

Farzaan.
89 951.
