I was in a similar predicament some time ago and a mechanic friend
suggested that one can remove almost any bolt by the following method:

1) Use the appropriate tool (to start with)
2) Get a 2 to 3lb sledge or deadblow hammer
3) GENTLY TAP TAP the appropriate tool (TAPPING is the operative word and
not hitting hard blows)
4) This could take as much as 15 minutes but you will eventually loosen the
stuck bolt.

Worked for me (I am a sceptic from way back) apparently the accumulated
energy from the repeated tapping blows slowly loosens  the bolt.  There is
also no damage to the fastener because you are not applying a huge force in
one instant. Give it a try and let the list know if it works. 

Well I didn't think it would happen to me....but

My crank shaft,
bolt
is

STUCK

I broke my breaker bar last night trying to get it off.  (well, it was a small
breaker bar 3/8, the connection broke off)

Funny, I didn't have a problem getting it off last time, maybe I'm a victim of
over tightening the bolt?

Anyway, this has been discussed before, I realize I can heat up the bolt to
remove it, but how?  Will a simply propane torch do?  Will this adversely
affect the timing belt?

Or can I keep trying to force the bolt off.  I don't think any wd-40 is going
to help because the bolt is holds a small bell housing that holds the pump
pulleys on.

Any help is welcome!!!!

THanks!
