Steve  

Thank-you  for your  prompt reply

My point was to tell the listmaster  that  there was and error message
on their website    as I said in my post.

Also to call attention to the fact the digest is probably not getting
thru to others as well as myself.

You obviously missed these points.

Please note  that I just want to list to work  right  and would
subscribe with payment for it if it works  as it should.   You might
not.

It is easy  to get on my  case  for having  the audacity   "to look a
gift horse in the mouth"   however  I would like to see the horse not
hobbled by things such as that error message that asked me  to report or
the fact that the digest is busted.

Steve  you are hereby forgiven for misconstrueing my post as I believe I
must not have been clear enough or you sent that reply without thinking.

                    Thanx  for your concern  /  Ed
