I should have been clearer that I am looking for the current state of
lubrication technology.  I tend not to adapt "wing-ding" technologies like
those seen on TV info-mertials.  However, much has transpired since my '89
944 S Turbo was engineered.  And, there just may be something new under the
sun.  I started using synthetic oil (Amsoil & Redline) in my new 1980 Volvo
244 DL.  It worked fine until the rear engine seal leaked so bad that I
could not afford it any longer.  I wanted to use synthetic in my 1983 BMW
R100RS, but ran into a glitch when the dealer pointed out that BMW would
void the warranty.

So, back to the original question...............What oil brand, type,
viscosity and additives are Porsche 944 Turbo owners using and recommending
today.

Thanks for your advice.
