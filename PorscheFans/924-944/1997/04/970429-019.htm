I don't think so Doug.  When I checked the bearings, I grabbed the rotor =
and tried to wiggle it in the horizontal direction, not in the vertical =
direction since in that vertical axis, the struts have some play.  (this =
play is visible with no load on the suspension, I have assumed that this =
is normal)  The passenger side bearings were a little loose and I =
adjusted that side.  The driver's side was OK.  BTW, the method I used =
was the 'Haynes approved' method of wheel bearing adjustment and then =
double checking for no noticable lateral play in the rotors.  I'm used =
to torqing the bearing retaining nut to a specified torque or degrees of =
rotation, and then loosing the nut a certain amount.  Will I get a =
different result with weight-on-wheels?  Is there a better method than =
the Haynes method?  I just turned the retaining nut(clamp) by hand until =
no play was felt in the rotor - which was really tighter than supposedly =
necessary since at that point I could not turn the washer with a =
screwdriver.  Any experienced advice would be appreciated.

(Attention ya'll novice Porsche mechanics - the hub's on these cars are =
aluminum and VERY soft metal - the bearing caps should not be pryed off =
with the old tap with a hammer and chisel method. I started out that way =
and after two taps realize that the hub lip was deforming, but the cap =
wasn't going anywhere. Use some channel lock pliers to grap the bearing =
cap and pull.)

Anyway, I don't know how you verify worn-out struts unless you remove =
them.

Thanks for the quick response.

I know you said you checked, but are you sure you aren't feeling loose
wheel bearings?
