I would think that the reasons that high viscosity oils are not favored
by GM and Ford are:

1) They are more interested in CAFE numbers than race motors.

B) They are more interested in selling more cars than helping your car to
survive for 200K or more miles.

III) They just don't care.

(Gee, hope I don't piss off the detroit contingent!)
