This is a fairly common problem with the 924, and I've heard of it on
early (pre 85.5) 944s.  I don't know of any fix for it, but it's almost
certainly something loose in the controls or improperly shielded or
something.

I've noticed it only shows up on my car when I hold the wiper wand in
until the wipers come on when cleaning the windshield.  If I just hold it
until it starts spraying, then move it down to the intermittent setting,
and continue pulling the wand, it goes away and never comes back.

If it's a quick and cheap fix, lemme know, would you?  I knew a guy who
had his wipers come on whenever he went around a corner, which was
actually pretty funny.  (That was the 944 owner, I think.)
