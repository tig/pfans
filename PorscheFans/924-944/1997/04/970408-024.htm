I would search for a very good paint shop and see if they can help.
Unfortunatly, I have seen bird droppings actualy eat away the clear coat on
paint.  Some times their diet includes some nasty ingredients that react
with paint.

In the future you might try going to a garden store and get a rubber snake.
They may deter birds as they are natural enimies.  I have not tried it
myself, but a friend (with a black car) swears by it.
