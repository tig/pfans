     Well, the mystery is solved.  Turns out the intake gasket
     on the #4 intake runner was cracked.  One "arm" of the
     gasket was partially sucked into the port leaving a gap
     of about 1/8" allowing non-metered air into the cylinder.
     Naturally, this would be a bigger problem at idle when
     vacuum is greatest.  Did a few "while I was in there"
     things as well:
     
     clean cold idle valve
     replace heater valve which had a leaking diaphragm
     clean throttle body
     clean intake runners
     
     Note: thanks to Anders and Dave for their suggestions.
