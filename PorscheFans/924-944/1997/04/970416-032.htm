If you want your turbo rebuilt and the housings and wheels are OK, get 
the rebuild kit-but you would be well served to have it professionally 
rebuilt.  All shops should dynamically balance the assembled unit for 
you after rebuilding.

The K26 in a stock 944T can exceed 110,000 rpm at around 6000 rpm on 
the tach.  Now, I know how much effort I put in to balancing my bottom 
end to within a gram for that crankshaft speed.  Without the math, I'm 
sure we can all figure out that it would take lots less than a gram to 
cause a turbo assembly to gyrate at that (rotational) speed, and break
the delicate oil barrier that keeps the turbo from becoming an expensive 
hand grenade (or trashing the bearing/journal surfaces).

I took my last rebuild to a reputable diesel engine repair shop - they 
do lots of turbo rebuilds for commercial trucks, and they stand behind 
their work.  Also fairly inexpensive.

Hey, maybe I'm wrong-but if one does screw up the rebuild, another 
rebuild might not be the cheapest option.
