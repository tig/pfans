The chip set should include a bleeder bolt.  This bolt fits into the
pipe
which runs from the turbo to the intercooler.  There is a banjo fitting
with a vacuum line attached.  By restricting the airflow through this
bleeder bolt, you are able to 'trick' the car into 'thinking' that it is
running less boost.  A small carburetor jet screws into the inside of
the bleeder bolt (the stock bolt is just hollow) and, by changing out
jets, you can increase/decrease boost.  If you do this, it is a good
idea to get an accurate boost gauge and attach it temporarily to see
exactly how much boost pressure you are running--the stock gauge is not
too accurate, especially above stock boost levels.

Reliability.  Well, common sense would indicate that the more power you
make from a given motor, the shorter the lifetime of that motor will
be.  As long as you don't get extreme with the boost and run high
quality fuel it shouldn't be a major problem.  As you raise boost, 
more heat is generated, which can lead to harmful detonation.  If
your car starts detonating, you can burn a hole in a piston or otherwise
damage your engine.  I wouldn't make too many top speed runs on full
boost because the heat simply can't be removed from the cylinders 
quickly enough, and the engine would be under maximum load.  Most of
the time though, at least in my everyday driving, the car is only 
asked to produce max power for short periods of time.
