James Pratt posted a note regarding movement of the rear glass on his 944
hatch, & Michael Samuels has a similar problem with his 968.

I have the same problem on my 944, but I haven't spoken to anyone about
fixing it.  The glass is separating from the frame near the roof of the car.
It has been in this condition for about two years, and other than a little
wind noise, I have had no problems driving it in this condition.  The amount
of separation has been slowly increasing, so I'll probably need to have it
fixed later this year.
