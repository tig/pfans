After 125 Kmiles, and many,many downshifts, the leather boot-cum-shift-
knob on my 944 85.5 broke, just where the palm on my hand pushes it
forward.

Pricing a new one in the local Porsche shop gave me very good incentive
to try to find another solution. This is what I did:

The old boot was taken out. This can be done by releasing the panel
around the shifter boot, and prying the boot itself off the edge. It is
fastened by a rubber band, sewn into the boot itself. The shift knob is
fastened by a spring clip, and can be released after that is loosened.
(actually, it can be loosened anyway - but the rubber bushing may
suffer. The old boot was secured by the bezel on top of the shifter
knop. Do not pry it out from the top - try to push it out with a
suitable tool from inside the knob instead. That will be easier on the
thin plastic edge on the bezel.

The old shift boot can now be used as a pattern for fabricating a new
one. Buy a piece of suitably coloured, nice looking, soft leather
somewhere (I found mine in a shop specialized in mending leather clothes
and bags). You will need a piece that will let you put the old boot on
it at least two times plus a fair margin. Make it rather big - the poor
deceased animals hide may not be too expensive, but *do not* buy a very
stiff piece - however cheap. 

Then, it's just a question of fabricating a exact copy of the shift boot
you have. Use the old one as a pattern. If the leather is not too thick,
your SO may help you with the sewing machine - otherwise, hand sewing is
not too tricky. The thing is to look for a very tight fit around the
shift knob - the rest is not critical at all. Work it on from the top,
make sure the seams are snugged down in the channels in the knob and put
the bezel on top when the fit is to Porsche's high standard. I even
reused the old rubber band, but that may have been overly cheap - a new
would have costed 10 cents.

The cost will be about 5 dollars for the piece of leather, about one
hour of hand sewing, or 10 minutes, max, on a sewing machine. The result
is quite good - longevity I can't obviously tell you anything about -
its only a month old.
