thanks... I am kinda looking for one...

A quick question...

I'm replacing the balance shaft seals, along with the head gasket, oil
cooler, and valve cover gasket and belts (but not the rollers and all- they
are OK)... is this difficult bolt the one that holds the outer pulley on,
or the actual crankshaft or both? I mean, do I need to mess with this thing
to do what I'm doing? Obviously, this is my first decent into this
territory... thanks...
