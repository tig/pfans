Chili From HELL!

Lyd and I are hosting the EIGHTH semi-annual chili cookoff and

and, of all places, our Living Room ?!?  Here are the complete
details:

Date/Time:  Saturday May 3rd,  One PM -> late 
	We'll start cooking at about 9am, start the blender about noon,
	the first chili ready about 3pm. Last time people dropped in
	continuously from about 2 until about 10 p.m. with the last people
	leaving about two am.  Show up whenever.

Place: 373 West Chestnut Hill Road, Newark Ph: 456-0630
