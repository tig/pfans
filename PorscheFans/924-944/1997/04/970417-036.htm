If you are in the habit of checking your pads when you bleed the brakes before
and after track events you don't need them. If you just cut the wires the light
will come on.

I cut the wires close to the sensor side of the connector, spliced, soldered them
and applied heat shrink tubing.

If you ever want to restore them just buy new sensors, pull the shorted connector
out, replace with the sensor and you're back to original condition.
