Folks,

Tip for auto-x.  To avoid the distraction resulting from hitting  
the wiper
stalk switch, pull the wiper fuse as part of your car prep.

When I first bought my 944, I was amazed at how well the driving position
was worked out.  Just lovely.  I was also amazed at how poor the  
hand control
(wiper, cruise, foglight) ergonomics had been done.
(This doesn't include the shifter,
which is perfectly placed.  Wish they'd put the brake/gas pedals closer 
together though. Germans must wear WIIIDDEE shoes!)

It's real common for us to hit
the wiper switch during spirited driving -- as Farzaan posted, this is a
real distraction during an auto-x.

I did this on the first lap of my 2nd auto-x.  Back on grid, I yanked
the wiper/washer fuse.
