     I noticed a slight whirring noise at certain revs from under the front 
     cover of my S2, (with the hood open) so I took a look at the belts.  
     Lucky I did.  I found that the balance shaft belt was flapping around 
     so much it was sometimes hitting the water pump pulley boss on the cam 
     belt.  I've tightened the belt up enough to stop this happening, but 
     can anyone tell me roughly how tight this belt should be - I don't 
     have a tensioning gauge, and I have to use the car for a while before 
     I can take it to the dealers to get it properly adjusted.
     
     
     Mike

  I too had the vibration in the shifter at 4000 rpm.  Turned out to be the
balance shaft belt. It was missing about ten teeth along the outside so only 
the lower belt was out of time.
     
  Someone also mentioned a loud whirring sound after having the belts done.
Check the balance shaft belt idler pulley. If this is incorrectly set then 
it can contact the belt as it runs over the top of the balance shaft 
sprocket causing a very annoying noise. I know...
