AFAIK, the problems with so called SS brakelines are that they simply
are not flexible enough for long term use. What makes them solid and
unyielding is the fact that they are *stiff* - and they are called SS
because of their stainless steel braiding, wich covers (and mechanically
protects) the outside - not because they are made of SS. In fact, these
lines are made of hi-tech thick-walled plastics - very dense and
mechanichally strong. 

The stiffness is both a blessing and a curse. The very same unyildiness
that makes the brakes a *little* bit efficient will make them unreliable
over time because they *will* crack and fail. 

So will rubber tubes, eventually, but the number of cycles needed to
reach the fatigue point will be very, very, large. Therefore, for
practical considerations, the automotive rubber brake line may be
considered safe for a sufficiently long time. It will show other
symptoms of ageing long before actually breaking - and the brake
degradation will warn the driver long before actually making the car
brakeless.   

Not so on the stiffer (and more more brittle) SS lines. Their tolerance
for bend stress and vibration induced fatigue is lower, and they may
*not* show any warnings before they break. 

The number of bending cycles the brake line will have to withstand is
tremendous. Obviously, the line is bent every time the steering wheel is
moved, but, also, one must consider bending involved in the constant
suspension cycles. It would be be fairer to look at these stresses as a
constant vibration, rather than a flex induced stress... 

Now, to the tricky part: That nice looking, braided, protective sheath
makes it virtually impossible to see any deterioraton of the brake line,
and hence, even regular inspection may not reveal any problems, until it
suddenly bursts. With all due respect for dual circuit brakes, losing
half the system is no fun at all.     

On racing cars changing brake lines is a matter of routine, and they are
*always* checked and changed at regular intervals - based on 'hours of
use' if not between every race. If that is the kind of maintenance
schedule one maintains - fine - otherwise consider the very real risk of
loosing the brakes in a situation where not only the car is at stake. 

New rubber brake lines may not be too bad, after all...
