This is indeed possible.  In VA, an emissions tests has to be done every
time a car is bought in order for the DMV to process the title, tags, etc.
After buying my first 944, it promptly failed the emissions test because of
excessive CO levels, and I immediately took it to my shop.  They opened the
hood, and adjusted a screw while monitoring CO levels from their own
equipment.  No labor charge because the whole thing took less than 3
minutes.  I confidently went back to retry my emissions, and I passed with
flying colors: .01!  For a first-time Porsche owner, this quick and free fix
was really assuring!
