This is what happened inside the engine:

There is a delay before the coolant takes up the heat from the
combustion, because combustion heat warms up the head, then the head
warms up the water. Most probably, the engine was at it hottest when you
let off the pedal and coasted. That meant that the water flow was (too)
slow, and that local boiling set in. This alone may have caused the
coolant overflow - as the extra volume in the tank will take care of
normal expansion. Combined with too high coolant level and a weak spring
in the coolant cap, it can happen even easier.  

In a properly designed cooling system (like Porsche's!), sizable boiling
takes place only when there is a mismatch between enhgine temperature
and coolant flow - just what happens after such a 'bullet move'. Usually
the boiling tends to be a selregulating phenomenon - the very small
bubbles formed in the coolant fluid (void ratio) will themselves hinder
a rapid development of the boiling situation because they make the heat
travel slower into the water.   

Sens moral: Do continue to beat the crap out those fella's - but dont
step down too early - keep up the revolutions (but not the engine load)
for a minute or two...   :-)))
