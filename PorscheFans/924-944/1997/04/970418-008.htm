I was worried about this at first, but the following works fine for me.  
1) Place floor jack under the center jack point on one side of the
vehicle (the jack point listed for use by the emergency jack). Use a
couple of pieces of plywood to prevent damage to the undercoating.  
2)Raise this first side of the vehicle just enough to place jack stands
underneath, make sure you use pieces of wood here as well. Use the front
and rear jack points for the stands.
3) Lower vehicle onto jack stands.  Raise the other side, and repeate. I
usually set this side up higher than the first so I only need to go
around to the first side once to obtain the desired lift. 

If you feal really uncomfortable about this, you could set up a very
gradual ramp using pieces of wood to get your car high enough to reduce
the overall tilt.  I use the 4 and 6 ton jack stands from Sears, those 3
ton deals are a bit small... Don't do anything you are not comfortable
with.

Good Luck and be safe!!!

'86 Guards Red 944, '87 Engine, more parts on their way, still up on
jack stands, but I guess it doesn't matter since it is currently snowing
outside!!!  This Vt winter just doesn't want to let go!
