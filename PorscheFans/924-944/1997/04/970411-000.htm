Hi all,

I've solved my intermittent starting problem at last.  Turned out the
molding which held the speed sensor was cracked.  The car would heat up
the crack would open the speed sensors would get too far apart: and bang
stall. I'm curious how it could have cracked though, when the helpful
folk at Weissach Performance took the speed sensor out, the molding
broke into 3 pieces which had been held together by the screws.  Hmmmm. 
Tx to everyone who helped me on this.

I need a bunch of odds and ends and don't know where to find them.  I
need the "vent covers" that are in the door frames, the drivers side
plastic guard that runs along the bottom of car, the little panel in the
dash with the heater/AC controls on it, and worst of all: a new digital
clock.  Ideally I'd like to find someone who's parting a car and is
willing let go of the above parts cheap.

The folks at Weissach also noticed something which no one else had
noticed (read my previous two "Porsche" mechanics).  I have a 944  non
Turbo Transmission on a Turbo car.  I would like to know whether there
are any concerns in terms of performance, transmission life, etc.
I am aware that the ratios on the two transmissions are slightly
different, and that the Turbo trans has a cooling coil.

Finally the PO also replaced the Drivers side door, and whoever did the
job did it terribly.  I am going to be taking it apart to fix it but I
have some questions: 
	1) Which window switch is *supposed* to open the drivers side window
the forward one or the rearward one?  I think mine might be backwards.
	
	2) My window vibrates if I close the door with it open, I assume the
bracket inside is loose, is everything pretty accessible?  I've done
this before, but not on a car with power windows so I imagine it will be
somewhat different.

	3) When I lock/unlock the drivers side door it doesn't unlock the
passenger door.  The pwr lock switch on the centre console works
correctly.  When I unlock the passenger side door it unlocks both, but
only locks itself.  What is supposed to happen?  Any suggestions?

	4) The power mirrors have been rewired funny.  The mirror select switch
is like an on/off switch.  And the lever moves both mirrors at the same
time if the passenger side is selected and nothing if the drivers side
is selected.  Does anyone have a good idea how to wire this properly. 
The Diagram in the manual leaves a lot to be desired.

Sorry this is such a long post, I just want to get everything fixed and
out of the way for summer.

Tx
