>>I have recently started looking for a pre-owned 944 (84-88).  This will
>>be my first.  I have come across several 84's with about 90-95,000
>>miles.  Can you offer some advice on choosing a fairly good one?

Well congrats on the decision to purchase one of the finest automobiles
in the WORLD.  I personally own a 1984 944.  I bought mine in October of
1995 and it is my first PORSCHE.  Min had about 88,000 miles on it. So
90-95K would be acceptable.  The best advise I can give is to see if the
car has all the paperwork with it. Owners manuals, maitanence receipts
etc.. This would be the best indicator of what has been or was done to
the car.  

Also, if you have a mechanic that you trust and you can, take the car be
the mechanic and have him check out the car too.

Good Luck!
