PorscheFans,

A couple of questions on problems I am having with one of my 924=92s.  Th=
e
car is a 1980 non turbo.  It has the five bolt wheels, although I am not
sure that they were factory equipment.  The questions I have are:

!.  The windshield washers pump does not have any power when the lever
is pulled toward the steering wheel.  I have looked at the wiring
diagram in the Haynes manual and it shows only one fuse that serves both
the wiper motor and the pump.  Are there any fuses or relays that I am
missing?  If not, I would suspect that the contacts on the steering
wheel are bad.

2.  Since it has the five bolt wheels the parking brake operates with
two small brake shoes on each of the rear wheels.  How are these
adjusted?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Tom Cooper, tcoop@radiks.net
