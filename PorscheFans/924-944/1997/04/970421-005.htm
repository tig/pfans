I was recently thumbing through the AutoAtlanta 924-944 catalogue and
noticed, in their tech-tips, a warning that the ring and pinion on the
944
are prone to early failure.  My local Porsche shop (West Palm Beach, FL)
says they have seen very few of these and my own 1985 (early) now has
160K
on the original transaxle with only a balky 1-2 synchro.  Am I living on
borrowed time or is Mobil 1 gear lube 'preserving' this one? 
Incidentally,
this car also has about 15 - 20 track ours on it so it is not as if it
has
been babied.  I would be interested in others opinions/experiences on
this
subject...

I broke a ring and pinion on my '84 944 at the LA Pro Solo one year. I
think the reason was that I missed a speed shift from 1st to 2nd. (Pro
Solos involve a standing start.) However, I have always heard from
knowledgable people that the 944 transaxle is basically bullet-proof.

Just another data point...
