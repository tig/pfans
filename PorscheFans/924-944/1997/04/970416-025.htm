Sounds like your switch isn't working correctly.  You might be able to take it
apart and clean it out.

As for you wipers not coming back down.  Wiper motors (I really haven't looked
at the porsche one) usually have two power leads going to them.  One is the
switch lead (your input) which is only on when you turn your wipers on, the
other is continous.  When the wipers are up, the circuit is closed, so the
wipers come back down.  When they are down, the circuit opens, so they stop.

J. Pasha wrote an article about the wipers a few months back in Excellence.
 You might want to go through some back copies of it.
