Dear CJ,

A lot of years ago I had a tri-color (yech green, primer red and priner
gray) Mustang that I was always working on. I had the same types of
prblems that you had... the battery wasn't strong enough to turn the car
over unless I put jumper cables on it BUT all of the electrical stuff
worked. I replaced just about every electrical piece on the car to no
avail. It wound up being a corroded battery cable from the engine to the
battery. It seems the PO had replaced the battery cables with made to
fit models and corrosion had worked it's way into the wire between the
end of the cable and the the first two - three inches of it. By jumping
the car, I was putting a lot more juice through the cable and overriding
the resistance. I would check you engine grounding strap for looseness
or corrosion and the battery cables.

Sincerely, 

Jim Mattingly
