Yesterday in the middle of an autocross, my car quit ('87 951). It was hard
to start yesterday morning, but once it started, it ran fine through 4
autocross runs. I parked it for lunch and had great difficulty restarting
it. Finally got it going and my son got one run in and was starting his
second run when it died and would not restart.

The symptoms were that it would crank & crank but not fire. After sitting
for a long time, it would crank, catch & then stall.

I suspect the fuel pump. Any other ideas? How difficult is fuel pump
replacement, and is the procedure documented anywhere?

TIA,

Mike
