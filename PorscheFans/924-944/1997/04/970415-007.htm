If the Club is a waste of time, what about a very large snake?

Actually, Wes, try contacting your local police department.  They can tell
you what statistically works, and what doesn't.  They also know where the
problem areas are and can give you specific tips on when, where, and how.

One thing in our favor is that the 944 is not a hot ticket on the stolen
car wish list.  But then again, these are just statistics and poop happens.
Glad you are alright.
