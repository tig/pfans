        Matt,
        I can probably arrange to get the odometer fixed for you, where are you 
based?
        The tappets may be noisy because of old oil, or because the oil bypass 
valve is stuck in the oil cooler housing.  Trust me, you are NOT hearing the 
sparkplugs firing...  If the ticking is almost like an electrical discharge 
sound then you may be hearing the injector solenoids.  
        I just replaced the timing and balance belts on a 951 for a labor charge
of $150, although it needed new rollers which increased the price of the parts. 
After doing this job, and finding out what a pain in the neck it is to follow 
some hand-fisted %$#%^* who tightens EVERYTHING to 400 ft-lbs, the price went 
up...
        Cheers,  Jan

1) a while ago the belts were squealing i finally made them stop when i got new 
ones and replaced the tensioner which had broken during an unfortunate accident 
involving RR tracks and a 45 MPH jump! well they are up to it again only
this time i think the problem is with the PS pump, water pump or both.  when 
i was checking them the other day i found that the end of the long tensioner 
by the alternator did not have a bolt in it. i am guessing that it is about 8 
inc hes
long but i am not sure.  Does anyone know???? i can hear the blets sagging and
i am now sure that this is the problem but i cant replace the bolts if i dont 
kno w
what size and length.
     
2) the amount of lifter click is unbeliveable! it was never this loud before 
and i mean 
you can easily hear it from the other side of the garage not a problem.  i am 
thi nking
that i might need new lifters but i am not sure of the replacement tech.  i 
imagi ne
one would have to take the valve cover off and go from there.  is it possible 
tha t i am 
also hearing the spark plugs fire?? they need to be replaced i have just been 
put ting
it off and since it wasnt being driven i didnt see much point.  if so what is 
the
 proper
torque setting? 
     
3) i bought the car sans service records so it is going to the p-car dealer in 
Sa n 
Antonio to have the timing belt etc. changed. i dont think it needs new rollers 
b ut that
is really not an informed opinion. the guy said that without looking he cant 
tell
 me
what the cost would be but i am imagining that it is going to be in the 350-700 
d ollar
range is this an exceptable guess???  
     
thanks in advance
matt
