For the gentleman looking for a datapoint on 89 Turbo prices, Paul and I
recently bought our cars.  I purchased mine in late August of last year
for C$28,900 + 14% tax = $32,946 (US$23,873).  The car was (is) in perfect
condition with 44,000km (27,500mi), all dealer serviced, but timing belts
and water pump were not done, so I spent about C$2000 on PM in the first
week of ownership changing all fluids, belts, water pump and worn brake pads.
Soon after, I did the rotors, starter motor, and a few water pumps before
I got a good one (factory instead of rebuilt).  The water pumps were all
covered under warranty of course.  The sticker price was $29,900 on the car
and I really didn't dicker that much.  In fact, I bought the car in the
span of about 1/2 hour including the test drive.  It just felt soooo much
better than the $60,000 Supra TT we just test drove that I really didn't
care how much it cost, and I haven't regretted it one penny!

Paul bought his a couple of months ago this year.  He paid $26,500 + 14%
tax = $30,210 (US$21,891).  His car had 46,000km (28,750mi) on it and
was in really good condition.  There were no dealer records, but the car
drove well and felt good.  We actually bought the car without even driving
it, but an after sales drive and check confirmed that the car was a good
specimen.  The main difference between his car and mine is that mine has
sport seats and is red, his has aftermarket brake cooling ducts and is
black and the dealer had the timing belts, water pump, etc. done on the
car.  Both cars came chipped, his Autothority, mine Andial turbo cup 
units.  Paul, obviously got the better deal, but ever since our two cars,
I haven't seen another 89T or 88TS for sale anywhere in the area, especially
not with the low mileage ours had.

My car now has 57,000km on it and Paul's is approaching 53,000km right now.
I'm still happy (unusual for me) with the power and the car is great, I'd
get one all over again.

Farzaan.
