	For those who were asking about the steering wheels. I just got my 
Momo Shuttle not too long ago. I was tempted to get the 320mm one 
because the 350mm wheel looks so huge outside the car. Don't worry 
about it... once it's in the car, it looks right. When I put the 
350mm up to my original wheel it didn't look like much difference... 
but after driving with it... BIG difference. You have to remember to 
take into consideration that the wheel itself is thicker than your 
original. After driving with a Momo I agree with what Paul said to 
me... "how the hell did you drive with that stock thing all this 
time?" As for specifics, car's just more responsive... if you've got 
a stock steering wheel, I HIGHLY suggest getting an aftermarket 
wheel. And try not to get suckered into buying a 320mm that you 
probably couldn't turn without huge arms.
	I guess I'm not really a novice anymore... I just started autoXing 
this year and I made 4 events so far. My very first event at 
Bremerton was a high speed course which was lots of fun. There's a 
local Novice series that I'm in which is  decently fun 
too(1st gear only for us Turbos). But I guess there's no substitute 
for hitting the top of 2nd in an autoX. Anyhow, my last autoX showed 
that I still don't know what I'm doing out there. I just try to take 
lines and be as smooth as possible... didn't seem to work first 2 
runs. 3rd run I slid all over, was rather jerky and put the gas down 
early everywhere... and I shaved off 2-3 seconds. Is it just me or 
does autoXing not really require smoothness? You always hear that the 
fastest drivers are the smoothest ones. I sat in one of the fastest 
944S2 drivers cars and I was surprised at how many things he was 
doing at once... especially with the steering wheel... he was almost 
hacking at it like rally drivers do. Maybe when they say smooth they 
mean outside of the car and violent as you want inside. 8-) BTW, I 
drive a '87 951.

P.S. There, I've finally said stuff I've been meaning to write for 
awhile... I'm just happy school's out.
