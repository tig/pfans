I'm not an expert but my 87 944 na exhibited similar symptoms when my
rubber center clutch was about to go.  It was sometimes difficult to get
out of gear and at other times seemed to work ok.  When the clutch was
replaced the old one had big chunks of rubber missing that caused the
difficulty in shifting.
