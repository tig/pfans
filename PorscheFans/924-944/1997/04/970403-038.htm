hey all,

my car is a 1987 944 NA

I wrote back a few weeks ago in reference to my desire to "reseal" my
engine, replace the brakes and replace the belts and replace the
radiator... and the importance of the factory manual...

well, I have a living room full of parts and a Haynes, but, no factory
manual... I call the dealer and Porsche North America weekly, trying to
make this situation seem stinky, but no avail... also wierd, is how I get
different stories from everybody... there's a typo, they are out of print,
they need x orders before they will ship, they are in a warehouse in
Nevada, they are in a warehaus in Germany, on and on...

I GIVE UP!

I will pay good money if someone will ship me their set of manuals, so I
may photocopy them and send them back... I worked my way through school as
a legal researcher/librarian, so I'm great with pages, and I swear that I
won't damage the pages in any way... I would rather do the copying myself,
since said library experience has left me rather anal when it comes to
documented information ( I hate poor contrast photocopies, crooked
photocopies, images that are too dark, etc... )

turnaround would be ASAP, less than a week...

thanks...
