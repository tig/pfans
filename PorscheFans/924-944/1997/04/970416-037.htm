Hi P-Fans!

Well, I finished up my taxes the other night and decided that
it was time to upgrade the turbo on my 951.  I am really not
sure what is the best way to go.  My turbo currently blows
more oil into the intercooler than I would like and also
is developing a small leak where one of the oil lines connects.
Anyway, I am just looking for some advice here.  Should I
go all out and get the hybrid K26/27.  I have already had
a recommendation for this route from a friend who has installed
the K27 hyrbid on his 951.  I called Turbo Performance Center
but I'm still not sure if their Max Flow turbo is really
a K26/27 hybrid or, well, something else.  Also, I talked
to David at PowerHaus who recommended the K27 hybrid as well.
Anyone out here running one of these on their car that can
give me some additional feedback?

Thanks,
Clark
