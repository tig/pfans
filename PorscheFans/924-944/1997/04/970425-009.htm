John,

I have an 1989 S2 that I bought new. Love it. Unfortuntely, there is
not much you can do to tweek it's performance. You can chip it, which I
did with a Weltmeister chip from Automotion. 

     -ABS is standard
     -0-60 is between 6-3-6.7 depending on which test publication
      you read at the time the car came out.
     -I have chipped mine and have noticed a slight improvement at
      the low end. From all the reading I have done (actual
      empirical tests) I gather the gain is about 3%. Granted the
      tests were done on normally aspirated 911's. On turbo's it
      is a different story altogether. Now...if I could recall where
      I read the stuff...I think it was and old issue of Excellence.
      In Fact, it was. If you are interested I can look it up and 
      FAX to you.

---------------------------

I am looking at an 89 S2 (USA car) and have been reading about the car as
well.  Some questions I have are:

1.  is ABS standard?
2.  what is the 0-60 time?  6.0 seconds or 6.9 seconds?
3.  does chipping the car help its acceleration?


Please respond to me directly as well as the digest.  Thanks,  John
