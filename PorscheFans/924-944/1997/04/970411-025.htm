Water is gravity fed from the top of the radiator to the bottom where it is
picked up by the pump.  From there it is circulated through the engine (and
interior) and then exits at the top of the block, right near the #1 intake
runner, and back through the radiator again.

The later (updated) pumps have a larger diameter pulley and the update kit
included a belt separator for the timing belt.  That separator is located
to the right (driver's side) of the water pump pulley.  The idea is that
it's supposed to keep the two parts of the belts (which are moving in
opposite directions) from coming into contact if your belt is too loose.

The water should flow from the pump along the pipe next to the exhaust
manifold, and into the interior.  My car is parked elsewhere right now or
I'd go out and look, but I seem to recall a separate water line which
routes through the water shutoff (driver's side, at the back of the
engine).  Check near there for the two lines-- one in, one out.  The return
side from the interior of the engine into the pump is within the engine
block, so you won't see an external return line to your water pump
(excepting the lower radiator hose, of course).  This means that the return
line from the interior of the car won't be very long since it only has to
feed back into the block.

When the engine is cold, water just circulates inside the block and the car
interior.  The principle is *not* that hot water is expelled so much as
that colder water is sucked into the pump when the engine gets warm.
Otherwise the engine just circulates the water within the engine block.

People on this list seem to have had around a 2:1 ratio for water pump to
belt life expectancy (about 60,000 for a water pump).  But if this is the
original pump, it's not just mileage you're fighting but sheer age-- 11
years now!  So when you do replace the pump, you'll be updating and likely
replacing the belts, all the rollers (definitely worth it), etc.

Hope this answers some of your questions.  Let me know if it doesn't.
