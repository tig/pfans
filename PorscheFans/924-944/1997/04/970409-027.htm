The SekurPlus(sp?) Sekurit or whatever it is called coating is almost like a plastic liner in the inside of the windshield, so that when the glass shatter it does not enter the cockpit (which did happen with my non-Sekurit-equipped car).  This liner is not too happy about glues and other
chemical being applied to it.  The sticky stuff you refer to are something like aluminum foils with special adhesive so that they do not harm the liner.  In addition, one would hope that when a service station guy that wants to use a stell knife to remove something like an old state inspection sticker will see the foil and ask before damaging your Sekurit layer. The dealer is supposed to carry this stuff, the car came with these when bought new (I think with two of these).

I hope this help and that I am not off in the left field.
