Don,

I appreciate your help!

The car is rock solid except for this new predicament.

Reason for replacement:  hot starting problem, progressively getting worse
during the past month.  A few days ago, got a surging problem while
accelerating to the freeway.  It cleared up and didn't happen again, but it
scared me into action.


Cranking:  it sounds the same all the time.  It never tries to catch.  The
battery and starter seem healthy.  Well, OK, my battery is getting kind of
tired by now and I'm recharging it...

Fuel pump:  I haven't had the benefit of a second person to crank while I
was under the car, but after cranking and leaving the key in the ignition on
position, I don't hear the fuel pump buzzing.   I'll have my wife crank
while I'm under the car tonight.  I'll also get under there with a voltmeter
to verify 12v at the terminals.

Fuel injectors:  they buzz with the ignition on.

More questions for you:

I've heard mention of the fuel pump relay being a culprit.  In the fuse box,
there is no such relay.  The closest reference I've found is taking the DME
relay out and jumping terminals 30 and 87 to test fuel pump volume.  Where
is this animal?  
        

        Thanks,

        John
