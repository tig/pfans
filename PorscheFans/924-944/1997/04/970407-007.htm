here's the options:
1) a ferrari testarossa
2) a 993 twin turbo
3) a lamborghini diablo
4) a honda, yes let's not forget that in europe they even wear honda badges!

92,340 is the price of a new NSX. who the hell do they think they are kidding??
for that price you get 290Hp@7000RPM. now we all go driving around at 7000RPM,
right?  then lets not forget the fact that you get all of 220ft-lbs of torque@5500RPM,
theres an impressive number! okay maybe the weight is worth the price, not so
they weigh 3200lbs.  well now i am confused must be the marvel of engineering,
right.  WRONG, where is the marvel, is it the 24Valve V-6??  Is anyone listening??
for my 92340 i want 
1) a body that is made of carbon fiber
2) i want the biggest alcon/brembo brake package on the face of the earth
3) i want a roof panel that doesnt sqeak over bumps
4) now the good stuff, i want a Mugen Honda V-10
5) 550+ HP at a usable RPM
6) 400ft-lbs torque
7) 0-60 in 3.6 or less
8) 200+ MPH
9) i want heritage not some damn wannabe piece of garbage
10) finally, 
 hi you have reached chevrolet. 
 yes, id like 2 grand sport corvettes and a geo tracker please. 
that will be 90000$ please.
not a problem and with my change id like to uprgade from my 944 NA to a 944 tubo!!!


maybe this warrants a 92,000$ price tag but until then i am glad to be a porsche 
owner.  and ever so glad that honda doesnt sell to many of these so i dont get
road rage and go postal worker on their owners for being about as dumb as they 
come.
