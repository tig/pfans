Sorry to hear about your experience.  I wish I had some answers for
you, but I am clueless.

What you are going through, however is going to become more and more
a problem, I fear.  Here in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, they
will be going to a more stringent dyno-type testing of automobile
emissions in the near future.  (There's a scary thought--a technician
revving up your car on a dyno under load--they won't let you drive
it--oops, my foot slipped!   :-(((  )   I know that 911 owners in California
sometimes have had an incredible time getting their cars through the
emissions tests (bring your lawyer with you to the test).  Plus, at least
for the 911s, the test requirements may not be correct for the older
vehicles as well.

Anyway, sorry I'm no help, but you raise a very important issue that is
going to effect more and more of us as time goes on--and EPA is
considering even tougher standards as we speak.

FWIW--James
