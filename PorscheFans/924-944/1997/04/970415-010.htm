they are almost the same and although i really have respect for chris cervelli,
i am not quite sure where he sees the advantage of a turbo.  a supercharger gives you power all the way through the power band there is NO ,NO, lag.  when you put your foot to the floor it is making boost all the way until red line.  thusly there is no peak. a supercharger puts approximately half the strain on an engine that a turbo does if the engine is a good one.  there is NO reliability problem and a supercharger NEVER has to be rebuilt.  One problem with them is that if the belt that runs it is not checked and it breaks then you are looking at catastorphic meltdown!!

that being said i think since the Porsche cars tradionally rely on turbos they are probably the way to go.  leave the superchargers to the american muscle cars, like my stang!!  

just another point of info. a supercharger and turbocharger all make different amount of boost depending on size, intercooler, etc, etc.......

        What are some of the advantages of turbos over superchargers anyway?
I know that superchargers run off belts instead of exhaust, but does one
make more boost than another?  Do they peak at different RPM's?  I've heard
that superchargers can compromise the reliability and longevity of an engine
more than turbos too.  I'm just curious and was wondering if you or anyone
else remembers what Chris said.  Was he saying that turbos were better in
general, or just in 944 applications?  Thanks...

During World War II, American engineers developed what they believed to be
the smallest ball bearing ever created and mailed it to Germany as proof of
America's technical superiority.  A few weeks later, the Americans received
a small parcel with their ball bearing inside.  A tiny hole had been drilled
directly through its center...
