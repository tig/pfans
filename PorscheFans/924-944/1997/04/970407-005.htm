Gentlemen:

I'm having a technical problem with my 89 944 (8v) which has me
stumped.  Cylinder number 4 misses at idle (I confirmed #4 with
the spark plug wire test, so it's not just the worn-out motor 
mount problem).  It seems to clear up at about 1500 RPM and 
high-end power isn't affected (confirmed this past weekend at 
Texas World Speedway).

Here is the list of things I have tried so far:

1.  Replace spark plugs.
2.  Replace distributor cap and rotor.
3.  Replace ignition wires.
4.  Replace #4 fuel injector.
5.  Replace O-rings on all fuel injectors.
6.  Check compression (all cylinders within 3 psi range).
7.  Timing belt checked.
8.  All four injectors clack away identically when checked
	with my new mechanics stethoscope by Lisle (a neat
	and very inexpensive device!).

During replacement of the distributor cap and rotor I noticed
a bunch of white powder on the connection between #4 wire and
the distributor cap.  The fuel injector didn't appear any
different from the others, but I have no way to check the flow
pattern. All four of the old spark plugs looked similar and
quite normal for used plugs.

The O2 sensor is getting lazy and is on the replacement list.
However, disconnecting it doesn't affect the idle problem.  The
only other known bad component (also on the list) is the heater
valve which has a leaking diaphragm.  I would think that this
should affect all cylinders more or less equally, though.

Please send your creative inspirations directly as the digest
is rather erratic.  Thanks very much for your help...
