Too funny!

My girlfriend has just informed me that here mother owns one of those cars.
She too got a great deal (a great deal more than she thought!).  It was
fine (relative term!) for about a year, but broke and no parts are
available.  It has been sitting in the garage for four years now.

I understand that you can unbolt the fenders and use it as a shopping cart,
but the wheels still wobble.
