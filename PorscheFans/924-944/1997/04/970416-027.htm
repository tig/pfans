When I looked at the Boxster, I made it a point to not only drive the 951,
but to park it smack-dab in the dealer's lot, in plain view.  They will
come out to greet you.  From a dealer's perspective, you are what you
drive, sad but true.  If you look like a potential customer then they'll be
all over you and you can sit, feel, smell, touch, and taste the car to you
liking.  You just need to schmooz and play their game.  It was a grave
mistake of that dealer to put the pressure on you that way.  If this
dealership wants to alienate their base of potential customers, nearly all
of which are previous Porsche owners and enthusiasts, then that's sad.  You
should not only get his name but contact the sales manager and write a
letter to PCNA.   I've gotten the rude treatment from BMW dealers I am
absolutely sick of them and won't set foot in another BMW dealership.  Why
would any BMW dealer bother to show me a used $13,000 535i when he has ten
people on the phone who will gladly plunk down $40k for a new one?  It's
all the more pathetic because if the major European carmakers want to woo
customers away from the Japanese competition, then they can't afford to
blow people off this way, especially those who represent the enthusiast
base and who don't always go for the highest-ticket items.  I hope this is
an isolated incident with this dealer.  Porsche dealers have usually been
polite to me, not that I visit them often, but if they were to see me drive
up in a "lesser car" I suspect the situation would be different.
