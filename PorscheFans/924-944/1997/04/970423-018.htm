You've done all the obvious things with the fuel system and ignition. 
Something else you might check is the proper setup of the timing belt. 
If it was off a notch or two....
One more thing to check..don't get insulted.. is the brakes.  I've had
the symptoms of power loss in my MG when the brakes were hanging up..
Good luck.. I'm still trying to get the bugs out of my 79 924.  I'm
about 90% there and they are great cars.
