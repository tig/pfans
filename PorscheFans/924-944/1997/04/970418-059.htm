I guess this proves what I wrote about the Blue book and other price
guides - they are not accurate for the 944 turbo S (and probably are 
not accurate for very low volume cars in general).

We (in the US and Canada) live in a free market society. If the cars are
selling for 19 - 25K, then that is what they are worth. Just because you
(and dealers, or blue book writers, or anyone else) don't feel the car 
is worth that much doesn't mean anything.

The cars are worth what they sell for, it's that simple. 

I believe that Tom Plutz went through the exact same thing you went
through when he was looking for a car. I believe he eventually found 
a nice car, but paid the appropriate price.

Just for the record, I have not seen ANY 968's selling for less than
a 944 turbo S. Now the 968 is newer (by at least 2 years) and does
have some nice features. However, unless the 968 is properly equipped
(with M030 package) the 944 turbo S will be a lot faster, especially
on the track.
