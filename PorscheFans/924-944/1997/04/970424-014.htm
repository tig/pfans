I've heard great things about PCA, but I'm always reluctant to join
organizations... probably for the reason above... they are sketchy in
meeting your needs... are you in Atlanta? I'm in Atlanta, and I'm getting
interested in tracking a 944... probably not my daily driver since it's in
such nice shape, but I'm looking for the $2500 944 that the teenager could
not afford to maintain... especially now that I've got the $400 tensioner
device!

the clutch must be bled with the brakes, they run off the same master
cylinder... I'm about to do this on my car this weekend... perhaps we can
get together and bleed brakes and clutch? I hear the clutch is a "real pain
in the butt"... that's a quote from a listmember... I have some notes on
this if you're interested...

mine has an internal coolant leak (oil cooler) that I'm going to fix after
the first of the month (always get paid before starting major work)... I
fidget with my coolant on a monthly basis now... no, not good... I'm
looking for flush tips now, except I'll have my head off... I have oil in
my coolant galleys... yes, the car really is in pretty nice shape!...
