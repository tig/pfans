     I owned an immaculate 944S for 5 trouble-free years.  Nice car, with 
     lots of "extras" as standard, but rather disappointing from a 
     performance point of view, despite 190HP versus 165HP for the 8-valve 
     (I live in England, and I think we get a few more horses than the US). 
     
     I've driven a few 8-valve  944s, and the low-end torque was better thn 
     my S.  Yes, once above 4500 rpm the S picked up its skirts and flew, 
     but how often can you drive like that in everyday traffic.  I hardly 
     ever used 5th gear.  I was also never impressed by the brakes despite 
     renewing everything.  
     
     Last year I switched to a 3.0 S2, and the difference is stunning.  The 
     S2 is everything I wanted the S to be.  Loads of low-down torque and 
     brilliant (ABS) brakes.  Servicing costs are only slightly higher than 
     any other 944 (but with all those valves,don't break a cam belt......) 
      
     
     If you are thinking of upgrading from a 2.5 944 forget the S, find a 
     few more _ ($) and go for an S2.   .
     
     
     Mike

Hey folks,
     
The post about the 944S for sale caused me to think about the 
differences between the S and the original 2.5 8 valve car.  Has anyone 
out there owned or driven both?  What did you experience as the 
differences between the cars?  Did the extra valves produce any 
differences that you would notice?  Are the maintenance costs/problems 
any different for the S?
     
TIA--James
