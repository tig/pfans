Yeah, I guess so.  *cough*

The most annoying time for ABS is on ice, which I suppose is when it's
most useful.  The problem is that some ABSes are so sensitive that any
brake pressure at all on ice causes the damn thing to kick in and vibrate
your foot like crazy.  It seems to work OK, and I really haven't got any
comparison for it, but it's still annoying.

I don't have any real problems with ABS.  And this I do think I can safely
say that, used properly, the advantage offered by ABS is fairly small
compared to a non-ABS system.  (That is, a non-ABS car, used properly.)
Depends on how you drive the car for whether or not it's worth the extra
couple grand most manufacturers make you pay.

You remember correctly.  It might have enough HP, at low gears (like,
floored in 3rd at 5K rpm or so), to make it noticeable, but I've had
occasion to be driving that aggressively... let me think... well, I'll get
back to you on that.

I sort of want to apologize for my brainless (there's that word!) message
and sort of don't.  I was citing my own experience with what I still
suspect may be LSD, not anybody else's.  I didn't claim extensive
knowledge on the subject.  In fact, I tried to make it clear that I really
only drive two cars regularly, one of which has LSD (or that electronic
thingy) and one of which doesn't.  Apparently, I made the YMMV variant at
the end too complex for most people to catch.

You're very probably right.  In fact, since you have lots more experience
in this, I'd say you certainly are.  Once again, I've never been in a
situation (legally) where I could claim to need LSD, and only one where
I'd really want ABS (and that because I was stupid).

For the track, sure, go for ABS, LSD, all those TLAs that you think might
help.  Even for auto-x, do it.  But I can't bring myself to drive that
aggresively just around town, especially since there are so few safe
places to really find my car's limits -- like I posted earlier, when
figuring out how to drive well (not that I'm really there yet), I almost
hit a guardrail, which would have been messy at about 65mph.

Because I don't want to make this a dissertation, and I'm starting to take
it too personally, I'll cut it short with these two points: I still
believe that the uses of LSD in day-to-day driving are limited, and I
*did* say that I was speaking from my own limited experience.
