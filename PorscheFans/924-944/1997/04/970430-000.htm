Well Porsche-fans we had about 18 of us guys show and 22+ plastic cars for
this practice event. We got 3 real long runs, over 100 seconds each versus
the normal 50-60 sec. course. 

The weather did not cooperate and most of us
only got 1 or maybe 2 dry runs. That was enough though for PCA to outrun
the Vettes! Two of the top three times were P-cars. Top time of the day
was 104.2 sec by a 944 S2 although a 951S had 103._ + a few cones.
Fastest plastic was 106._ on worn out race tyres. As per usual for the
Vette club the course had 2 long straights (close to 70mph for the power
cars) and some challenging tight offset gates and a long slalom. Even with
the rain I'm sure we all had a great adrenanlin rush.

Be sure to mark your
calendars for the official Porsche versus Vettes autocross on Sun. Jun.29.
It will make for a good practice too for those going to Whistler Weekend
for the PCA autocross. If you have any autocross related questions, drop
me an e-mail post.

By the way, one of the local autocross clubs will be
holding a autocross driving school on Victoria Day Mon. May 19, call
(604)734-SOLO for 24 hr. pre-recorded message. Or contact me for more
details, it's only around $45 and you will learn alot about driving your
car to the limit and beyond in a safe, controlled enviroment.
