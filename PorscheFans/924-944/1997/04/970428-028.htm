You may want to take the pump apart.  Unless the one you have is radically
different than the one in my 87 944S, you should be able to remove the four
screws (I think they are 5.5mm) and first take the pump motor off the pump
so that you can try it with a 9V battery.  If that passes the test, the pump assembly
comes apart easily by pulling on the little metal plate.  Try not to destroy the seal
as you pull it apart.  My pump had collected "crud" in it which effectively seazed
the pump.  Once I cleaned it, operation was restored.  Took me about 20 minutes
from start to end.
