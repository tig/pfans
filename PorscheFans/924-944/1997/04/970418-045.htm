<< I have much the same problem with my 83 944. Believe it to be a bad ground

 or connection behind the gauge panel. Frankly, I've just not had the time 
 to go and figure it out. No doubt I will soon (after my honey-do list goes 
 down....)
 
 The Haynes manual tells you how to remove the instrument cluster. I'd start 
 with that and see if there's any corrosion, grounding problems, bad 
 connectors. I had a heck of a corrosion problem with my car, and so that's 
 why I suspect additional corrosion behind the gauge cluster.

I had a ground problem, whereby the oil gauge didnt read properly.  Till one
day I had the oil gauge panel out , and there was a ground connection LOOSE
behind that panel.  But I dont think that this is the problem this time.
