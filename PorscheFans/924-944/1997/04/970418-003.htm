Anyone else in a similar situation but a bit closer to Pittsburgh, PA?  I'm
hoping to purchase a 951 soon, but CA is a bit far to go (for me at least).

Thanks for any leads!  (especially if you're going to Rountop this weekend
because I can't make it! :( )

Allen Look wrote that he had his Gauges Re-aligned.

What does this mean ?

I am convinced that both my Speedometer and my Trip Meter/Odometer  show
numbers that are much higher than they really are.  When my speedometer
says 150km/hr  I'm usually travelling at the same speed as almost everyone
else on the highway (which is usually about 120km/hr when I'm driving my
wife's Escort).

My tires are the stock size so its not the tire size throwing the gauges
off.

Can these gauges be calibrated ? Is this an easy fix  ?  What is involved ?

 TIA
