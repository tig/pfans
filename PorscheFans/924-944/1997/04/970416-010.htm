The Alpine stereos with security features that I have seen have a small
auxiliary PCB inside the unit that when pulled ' restore ' the stereo
without need of a code. No system is full proof, just so long as they
are sufficiently fool resistant to deter those socially challenged
knuckle draggers out there.

Sounds like an excellent feature!  My Alpine 3D-Shuttle head-unit has a
detachable face as well as "Code-In Security" that requires entry of the
proper 4 digit code to turn on the stereo after its power supply has
been
disconnected.  While 4 digits may seem like a pretty small figure,
Alpine
has incorporated a feature that makes it much more difficult to crack
the
code.  It will accept 2 or 3 wrong codes (buffer for accidental mistakes
in
owner entry) before waiting 10-20? minutes for the next available
code-entry
prompt.  After each successive wrong entry after this, the time between
code-in prompts increases sort of exponentially.

The Alpine stereos with security features that I have seen have a small
auxillary PCB inside the unit that when pulled ' restore ' the stereo
without need of a code. No system is full proof, just so long as they
are suffecently fool resistant to deter those socially challanged
knuckle draggers out there.
