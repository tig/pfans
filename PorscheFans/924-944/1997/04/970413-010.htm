I'm sure it was a very nice 928. But I was offering advice to someone,
who by the tone of the message, wanted to supercharge a NA944. I dont
doubt that the equipment is out there to do it. But assuming the vehicle
then produces similar horse power to a 951 that car becomes under
engineered for its new role. To bring it up to a similar or better spec,
brake and suspension wise,  as a late model 951 is simply not economic
good sense considering that you only have a mongrel car as a product.
For a similar outlay you can go out and have something that has been
designed and built by people who really know what they are doing. Chris
Cervelli gave an excellent summation of why turbos are superior to
superchargers a few months ago on the POC chat board. If you are out
there Chris.....

my 5 cents worth.

Give your friend the $20,cut your loses, and go buy a turbo.
Superchargers are for drag cars, which dont like going around corners.

Actually I've seen a supercharged 928 generating over 650 horses. It
lapped
everybody on the track quite nicely.
