      Everyone was real helpful re: cleanout procedure for the idle speed
stabilizer on my 1987 944s.  The intake manifold removal was described as a
DIY job.  However, Haynes (my only source for the procedure), of course, is
based on the 8v model and is particularly unsuited for use on this procedure
as the engine configurations seem radically different in all respects in
this area. In fact, the first step - depressurization of the fuel system -
stopped me in my tracks.  For the 8v, simple removal of the "fuel pump fuse"
and running the engine is all that is needed.  However, on the 16v version,
the fuel pump fuse (#34) renders the engine unstartable.  I assume something
else (a relay?) might be the weapon of choice, but there is not a relay
identified in the manual as the right one.  I also anticipate other problems
from examining the engine layout such as removal of the fuel rail which
appears to be a more complex procedure on the 16v than on the Haynes 8v.

        Before I set myself up for the hundreds of dollars the shop will
charge (What, you want me to spray it out, when I could gouge you on a
replacement???!!!), I was wondering if a patient soul might want to post or
mail me a step by step procedure for removal of the intake gasket on the
944S (I will not be insulted by tedious detail).

        I also, while studying this problem, became curious about the
possibility of a spray cleaner which, if introduced while the engine is
running into the system, might effectively free up or clean the stabilizer
(or destroy the engine).

        My problem, intially, is unstable or weak idle; intermittent
stalling on deceleration from high speed; poor off idle performance - all of
which appears to become worse as the day goes on and the engine becomes
warmer and which is made all the more frustrating by the fact that, at
times, everything works fine.
