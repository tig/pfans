Chris,
      Having gone through this recently, I would suggest you buy a
larger breaker bar, and a 6-point impact socket.  I used 1/2" drive
stuff from Sears. Since the breaker bar alone wasn't long enough, I used
my Floor Jack Handle as an extension for more leverage. I braced myself
against the vehicle with one hand, and just kept pulling with the
other.  The breaker bar flexed, the 1/2" drive extension flexed, and I
thought they would break, but the crankshaft bolt eventually broke loose
with a bang. I estimate it took ~800ft-lbs.   Although some had
suggested to me that heating the bolt would help (I think Jim Richmond
said his engine builder heated it to a dull glow) I decided not to do
that. I would suggest against heating unless absolutely necessary.  The
oil pump is right there, timing belt, etc..  You are correct in that
WD-40 doesn't do anything.  I sprayed tons on mine, and when the bolt
finally came out, it was shiny and bone dry!  I think the seal between
the Bolt Head, washer, and the pulley is too tight to allow any WD-40
in.. Also, I sure hope you are using the Flywheel lock, and not a
screwdriver or punch as the Haynes Manual says! (I used the flywheel
lock)

Good luck!  Let us know how it goes!
