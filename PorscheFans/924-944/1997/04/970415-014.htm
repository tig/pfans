Hello fellow Porsche fans:

I have recently purchased my first Porsche ('86 944 Turbo) and have a
couple of questions.

	1. I recently had the Thermostat replaced and since the repair
	was made, the heater inside the car is really misbehaving.
	The heater is not respecting the position of the knob that 	
	controls the temperature of the air coming in to the vehicle.
	The air is almost always HOOOTTTTT!!!!
	Is this related to the Thermostat or could it be a separate 
	and distinct situation????

	2.  Second question, this is really driving me crazy, the dash 		lights
in the car are barely noticeable at night.  These lights 	are really
DIMMMM!!  What can be done about this??? I am 		desperate to get
repaired.  I've already had my mechanic replace 	the bulbs with a set of
higher wattage bulbs, this helped to 
	a small extent. What else can be done???

	3.  What is the best way to fix a cracked dashboard?? 
	I've seen "Sleeves" for this, and I have also seen repairs on 	the
dashboards themselves.  

	4. Last question,  I would like to replace the material the 
	covers the overheaed area of the car. I would call it the 		ceiling;
however, that sounds really kinda silly.  The area
	above your head whenever your sitting in the car.  There are a 
	few rips and tears in this area.  Any Advise?????

	
Well, that should do it......If there is anything else I should be aware 
of , please pass on the advise, I could use it at this point.....

thanks,


dan
