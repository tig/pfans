	Steve, potentially bad news here; the behaviour you're describing
	was the beginning of the failure mode for my last clutch. The
	rubber center began to fall to pieces and was lodging in places
	it shouldn't have been making the shifting very, very stiff.
	Good luck...

     I just put a set of Borbet C2 Cup wheels (17" X 7.5" and 9") on my '86 
     951 and they look great!  I've compared them to the real thing and I 
     actually like the look of my Borbet's more!  The Borbet's are softer 
     and rounder, and seem like they are "brighter" too.  However, I've 
     seen other brand replicas and their finishes don't look as nice as 
     those that are on the Borbet's.
        Tire Rack will know which offset is necessary for your car--they 
     obviously had to match it for my '86 951 (23mm?).  There are some 
     web-pages with offset info but I can't find their addresses anymore.
        By the way, for those interested, I weighed my new and old wheels.  
     I was afraid that my new Borbet's would be heavier than my 16" (7" & 
     8" wide) phone dials, but I was wrong.  THE BORBET'S ARE LIGHTER!  The 
     phone dials with inflated tires were each over 40 pounds (the rears 
     were about 1 pound heavier than the fronts), and the Borbet's with 
     inflated tires were 13-14 pounds lighter per wheel!  (I have to admit 
     that I never actually weighed the Borbet's, but the UPS shipping tag 
     indicated the total weight of the package, including wheels with 
     mounted and inflated tires, so I ignored cardboard packaging and just 
     divided by 4 to get a rough estimate.)

HI P-fans,

I have recently purchased a 92 968 coupe, it has the standard 16" 
wheels, I am interested in installing 17" wheels on the car. Will the 
BORBET C2T 17" fit (as advertised by Tire Rack in magazines like Car and 
Driver). I know I need 17"*7.5 in the front and 17"*9 in the back, but I 
read somewhere that the backspacing should be 150.3 mm front and 166.3 
mm back and offset 55 mm f and 52 mm back. What is backspacing and 
offset, is it the same for the 968 as the 911 C2 Turbo ( hence the name 
of the BORBET wheel). Has any one tried them long term and would you 
recommend buying them as opposed to the factory 17" that are $1,000's 
more.
     
I have just had my engine oil changed, Porsche recommends 5W30 but my 
P-specialist put in 10W40 synthetic, I live in Montreal Canada, will it 
withstand -20 C in winter?
     
Thanks for the info P-friends and good summer.

Subject: 951 Clutch Options
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     In a brief discussion with my mechanics yesterday, they told me that 
     they usually replace their 951 customer's factory clutches with 930 
     units.  Apparently, they are not more expensive than stock 
     replacements and are of course made to handle 930 torque.
        Does anyone know how these 930 clutches compare to the "Turbo Cup" 
     clutches?  Does it not have those fragile inner springs too?  Anyone 
     driving with a 930 clutch?
        Any info or insight would be appreciated...
