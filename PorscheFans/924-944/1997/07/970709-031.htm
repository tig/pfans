I have a similar power window problem developing on my 924S.  The window
mechanism hasn't failed yet, but its starting to bind a little when the
passenger side window almost reaches the top.  Pulled the door apart as
you did until I reached the point that I had to remove the inside door
handle.  Haynes describe that it could be removed by a single screw that
didn't seem to exist.  So rather than force prying anything off (never a
good idea), I simply put it all back together and have left this window
in the closed position (feared what happened to you...failing in the
down position).  Knew eventually a fellow member of the page would run
into this problem and hopefully learn how to solve it.

When you do, please let me know how you did it.  If I figure it out on
my own and you're still stuck, I'll return the favor!

As I become more familiar with my toy, I've noticed that almost
everything on the FAQ is happening on my car.  At least the FAQ helps
you read the symptoms and provides some guidance on the cures.  One of
the positive things about my car on the FAQ items is that the metal
under my battery has zero rust and so I'm in no immediate danger of
having water leaks into the passenger side leg room.  Glad dad lived in
Florida!

Regards, Rick
