Hi P'fans,

Well here I was just days (well a week and a bit) from getting my 931 back on
the road after a complete engine/clutch/turbo re-build last thing to do was
get the old KKK K26 Turbo re-built. Sent it off last week to a bunch of cool
people (Turbo Direct), and have just been informed that my faithfull old K26
is as dead as a Doodoo. Looks like the PO had some major problems, The guys
at TD say it looks like a piece of a exhaust value has been injested by the
turbo. Strange when I took the Head off all looked fine! The PO probably had
a major engine problem and only did half the job. Anyway the engine is now
totally rebuilt only missing a Turbo. The guys at TD are looking around for
the parts needed to re-manufacture the unit. Does any one have a cheap K26
lying around or any ideas what I can replace it with????????

Heeellllppppp

        Richard.
