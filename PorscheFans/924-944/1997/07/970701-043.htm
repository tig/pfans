I didn't pick up the original thread, but I would suggest that head gasket 
problems on both 944s and 928s are VERY possible if the car has been
run hard, perhaps on the track, and has gotten hot.   These heads do not
like high heat and will warp if mistreated.   Been there, done that.

>Allen, no I would not expect a head gasket problem on a non-turbo model at
