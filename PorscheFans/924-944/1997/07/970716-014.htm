	A couple weeks ago I wrote that my 86 944 was not accelerating smoothly in 
the mid RPM range at partial throttle.  After testing every ignition 
component, I checked the throttle position sensor which had been suggested 
by someone on the list.  They were all fine.  One person suggested that I 
check the oxygen sensor in the exhaust.  So as a last resort I unplugged 
the sensor from the engine wiring harness in the engine compartment.  I 
went for a test drive with it disconnected; it was smooth and pulled 
stronger than ever.
	The Bentley manual for my old BMW 325I has a very good section on oxygen 
sensors.  BMW suggests replacing them every 30,000 miles.  It also 
describes how to test the sensor using a multimeter.  I have not performed 
the tests yet, but I hope I just need to clean it, because oxygen sensors 
are expensive.
	Writing about expensive: I have started buying all my parts from my local 
Porsche dealer here in Albuquerque, because they have been cheaper than 
Automotion, Tweeks and Performance Products.
