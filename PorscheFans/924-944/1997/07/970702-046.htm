Well, it's up to you, really.  I'd either bite the bullet and rebuild 
what I have, or buy a good used box.  The only problem with the latter 
is, to quote Stan Hanks, you've already got a used transmission.  How 
good is another good used box really?

When you say "carrier", I assume you mean the open differential. 
 Despite visual appearance, I would absolutely magnaflux the pinion 
gear, and preferably the ring gear as well.  You may not see any 
damage, but you don't really know for sure.  You also don't know 
whether you've spun the pinion or diff bearings, yet.

Hi all -

Well, the transmission is out and apart.  Or at least the differential
side plate is off.

What I found is a carrier that has broken at both points on the ring 
gear
side and one point on the opposite end.  Suprisingly it didn't crack at
the pin/dowel location through the spider gears.  The first comment the
mechanic asked me was where I was hiding the V-8!  Guess those speed
shifts and 2-1 downshifts have taken their toll.  There are signs of 
the
cracks having been there for a while and then of course major failure 
over
the weekend.  The ring and pinion look to be in good shape; no sign of
damage and very little metal in the bottom of the case.  All of the 
damage
is limited to the spider gears, side plate cover (which is in about 
five
pieces) and of course the carrier.  Haven't really looked at the 
bearings
yet.

So the decision, do I buy a rebuilt/used transaxle or do I repair it. 
 A
friend has a complete carrier from his transmission (price?) when he 
put
in a limited slip.  Kevin and George, what do you have available for a
'86 NA car?  Anything with a limited slip in it?  Or do I repair it and 
at what cost?  Sure would be easier to just install another transaxle.

Thanks for everyones suggestions and help.
