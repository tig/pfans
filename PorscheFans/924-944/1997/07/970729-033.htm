Hi, Vaughan,

In the June, 1991 issue of Porsche Panorama, John Paterek wrote:

"...This is probably caused by letting the hatch fly up against the stop
rather than restraining it by hand.  Epoxy sealant bonds the glass to
the
aluminum frame and after years of use, the hinges bind due to lack of
being lubricated.  The frame breaks off, lifts the glass, causes the
leak
and soon becomes inoperable.  It can be repaired by unbolting the glass
deck lid, sitting it on a pair of work horses and cleaning out the old
epoxy.  When the surface of the glass is clean and dry, mask the glass
and frame and fill the gap with black two-part epoxy (Devcon).  Clamping
may be required if the frame is bent.  Before it is dry, pull the tape
off and let dry for 24 hours before reinstalling the glass lid.  The
repair will hold and save many dollars in replacement deck costs."

The key here is in using epoxy.  Anything else just won't be up to the
task.
