For those of you still entertaining the idea of fitting a K&N to your
car the only benefit I can see is you will never have to buy another air
filter. Replacing the stock paper filter with a K&N will have no gain
mostly because of the limitations in the design of the air box and
induction system prior to the turbo. Although we all still wait for the
dyno results from the K&N 'cone' style I'll go out on a limb and say
there will be no HP gain that you will feel is worth the $100 they
charge for the kits.

If it decreased turbo lag, we would have seen it on the dyno.  The
only aspect that wasn't measured was throttle response.  This is
something
we will be testing next time.  We are going to take the car to 3500rpm
and floor it and see what happens.
