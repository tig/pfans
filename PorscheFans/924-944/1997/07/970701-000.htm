Here is how Waterwetter works (as far as I can tell):

One way to remove heat from a large piece of hot metal is to flow some sort
of fluid over it. You can use air (e.g. my 914) but the efficiency of that
transfer isn't all that good.  Better is to use a glygol coolant (e.g.
Prestone) -- it has a better heat capacity than air.  Better still is to use
pure water -- better heat capacity than coolant.  Water with "waterwetter"
in it will actually have a worse heat capacity than pure water, so in the
ideal case, it is better to use just water.

But water with "waterwetter" *is* much better than air!  Sometimes, usually
in the head during hard driving, localized boiling occurs because the water
is not able to take the heat away fast enough. This starts a "teufelskreis"
because this boiling causes gaseous water instead of liquid water to be the
coolant.  This cools even poorer still and causes the head to get even
hotter causing more gaseous water to form, ad infinitum.  One way to stop
this is to use pressure, thus raising the boiling temperature of water.
Another way is to change the characteristics of the boiling bubbles.  Adding
"waterwetter" changes the surface tension of the bubbles, making them
smaller, easier to float off of the surface of the metal.  That in turn
allows more liquid water to be in contact with the metal, in effect
minimizing the problem with boiling.

This explains the various claims about Waterwetter.  Some people see
absolutely no effect.  They probably seldom have any boiling occuring in the
head and thus Waterwetter makes no big difference.  Some people so a 30
degree drop in temps.  They probably have a great deal of boiling and thus
get a big effect.  I saw pretty much no effect in my (perfectly running) 93
Honda Civic, but in my 72 Ford F-250 in the Mojave Desert summers it had
quite a large effect.  (BTW, that is sort of a People Magazine version of
the science behind the whole thing so please excuse any liberties.)

One last thing: a couple of days ago someone wrote in about filling his 951
up with coolant after losing a major amount of it.  Crucial to this process
is to bleed air from the coolant system by unscrewing the bolt on the
coolant manifold (over near the distributor) until coolant starts to flow
out, then retighten. You might be surprised just how much air you still have
in the system.
