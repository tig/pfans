Ok here goes my first post....

Having been the proud owner of a 1988 944S for the past 2 years I am about 
to buy a 968 Coupe.  Its having its check up tommorrow at a local 
Porsche specialist and I am hoping all will be well.

I have been trawling through the PorscheFans archives for the past 3 
days and it has been very informative.  Especially to know that I am 
not the only one with the dilemma about "should I buy a 968 or a 
Turbo S".  My first wish was for the 968 as I really like the 
styling, but I didn't think I could afford one, so the Turbo seemed 
the best bet.  Then this fairly higher miler (90k) came up in my 
price range so I swung back to the original plan.

I like the 944 styling as well (not so much the early cars 
like my current one), but I find the pop up lights and the aggressive 
front end of the later models a teeny bit old hat now  (please don't all lynch me 
at once!!).  And although I have only test driven a 951 once and a 
968 twice, I think I am going to take the more modern looks of the 
latter and sacrifice that 10 or 11 bhp of the former.  I now hope for a mass
of postings telling me I am doing the right thing :)

I am only really planning on using it for street driving, so apart from the ego 
massage, how often will I really get to drive the Turbo to its best?  Only time
will tell if I will miss the extra kick in the pants.  As I keep reading,
almost the same power is there in the 968 but in a more 
consistent torque curve.  Even with its 250bhp, the turbo seemed a 
bit lazy below 4000rpm, something I hate about the 944S, but have 
learned to compensate for.  It seemed to me that the Turbo had the same problem 
until the boost cut in.  The 968 gets up and goes as soon as you 
breathe on the throttle, this seemed a much more relaxed way to drive 
day to day.  Having said that, you could still wind up the revs and 
let things get interesting if you wanted.  

Aside from perfiormance, the thing I really like about Porsche is the clean lines and 
understated styling.  Not like the Italian macho wagons, the Ferraris and all 
the other makes ending in 'is'.  Not only do they seem to come in a 
choice of red or.... red, but the abundance of ports and protruberances 
just seems rather vulgar to my delicate British sensibilities :)

A Porsche hints at its power but doesn't shout about it.
The new shape of the 911 is the best, (I 
think the front of the 968 hints at this - which is partly why I 
like it - not having the money for a newer 911), although from the 
pictures I have seen I don't think I am going to like the '98 styling. 
Sorry..The front end Boxster bolt on look just doesn't do it for me.  
All the above carries the IMHO tag so please be gentle.

So I hope to be posting more stuff in the future about my fledgling 
days as a 968 owner.  I agree with the past comments about the lack 
of 968 postings and hope to be able to contribute something in that 
area.  It would be nice to see more postings from this side of the 
world as well :)

Sorry for the long post but, HEY its my first time!

Anyone wanna buy a 944S?
