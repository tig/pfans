Hi Wesley.......thanks again.  I disappeared off the list a couple of weeks
ago, so I don't know if I got any other answers - I'll try again soon.

2. 95 is RON = 90 CLC= (R+M)/2 - sorry, you lost me here - what is CLC
(when I know I'll phone a local Fuel company and find out, but I want to
know what to ask.  Unleaded we have 92 and 95 RON (I think) - if all that
happens is that the Engine Management retards to cope I don't mind using
lower grade, but I don't want to do any long term damage.  They are now
starting to discount the 95 when they discount the 92 (didn't used to), so
it's not so much of a problem.

4. Apparently it doesn't - it has to be an 87 onwards.....don't know why.
I managed to source a new one from the UK, so problem solved.

7. Any experience of adjusting these ?  Do I try and take the pins out of
the door frame, so I can open the door completely and get in from the front
of the door, or do I strip the inside out of the door and access from there
??

Other questions/projects in progress/completed (fyi in case I can help
you).

a.  Respray front door lower speaker grills
b.  Solve problem of broken hinge on cassette box without spending big $'s
c.  Replace perspex in front of instruments
d.  Repolish gear lever gaiter
e.  Replace drivers door window and work out why it's getting scrathed by
going down/up
f.  Find a way of making sure rubber hose stays on back of air temp sensor
for auto A/c
g.  Find replacement grill to cover air temp sensor for auto A/c
h.  Find way to stop dashboard on drivers side squealing/rattling (since
attempted theft)
i.  Refresh switchgear (e.g. Sunroof switch) without replacement
j.  Establish whether instruments lights unnaturally dim (posts on this
list suggest this is common problem).
k.  Fix flickering fuel/oil pressure guages
l.  Work out whether there should be fuel/temp warning lights showing (as
per oil pressure) prior to starting engine - if so, why not.
m.  Replaced clock bulb - not too difficult, but a couple of traps for the
young player.
n.  Find parts shop in US/Aus/Ger who will respond to EMAILs to get
cheapest quotes

I'm sure there will be more......IanS

In summary no it wont make a difference if you're not driving hard. But if
you're under full throttle the ignition will be retarded if it senses
knock and you wil have less aceleration.

I have a S2, remember 95 is RON = 90 CLC= (R+M)/2 . We have CLC 87, 89, 92
and 94 avail. here in Canada. What about down under?

I'm guessing yes.

Mine don't open that wide. There is a slight click/detent before the door
is fully open.
