I'm not going to bother answering your other ridiculous questions (ie, why
didn't the 928 get 600hp, et al), but I think you should mention that the
968 you refer to above (from my memory) is a normally aspirated car.  
Porsches have had their turbochargers restricted for some time, because
of their superiority.

Porsches are not the be all and end all of supercars, but in my mind,
they are pretty damn close!  And, I can drive it to work everyday.

Just for fun, I went out and took a Firebird for a drive at lunch.
The power, while there, feels stifled by something, perhaps air
box?  exhaust?  engine internals?  The car is not as smooth as my
951 and I have no idea where you got the idea they handle better!
The back end wiggles as you drive down bumpy roads, without any power
being applied.  You feel like you are driving on top of something,
like you are gliding on air, almost out of control when pushing it.
I was expecting the power to overwhelm all of these shortcomings
and make the experience positive, but I have nothing but bad things
to say about this car.  If your 951 handles worse or feels less smooth
than the Pontiac, I suggest you take your car to your local PCA 944
tech and have him drive it;  he will figure out what's wrong.

Sorry, I really wanted to see what all the fuss was about this Firebird
and came away dumbfounded as to why a company of GM's size produces
such garbage.

Farzaan.
