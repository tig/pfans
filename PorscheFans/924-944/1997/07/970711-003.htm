Raymond:

The most important measure when changing pistons, conn rods, or
cranks  is compression ratio.  The other most important factor is
bottom end  clearance.  

compression ratio =(swept piston volume at bottom dead center+ head 
combustion chamber volume) / (top dead center piston volume + head 
combustion chamber volume).  If your pistons aren't flat tops, you 
must measure the volume of those with mineral oil.  Same goes for the
 head chamber volume.  I could explain a way to do it, if you like.  

Boring is the easiest way to increase displacement, but I think it 
requires that sleeves of cast iron be installed in your block.  
Stroking requires a stroker crank.  could be expensive, and might 
cause clearance problems at the edges of piston throw.  It might be 
possible to put a crank from an S2 or a 968 in there...  I dont know 
if they fit, though-

Hi Dave:

Thanks, I appreciate your response and have some references on
calculating/measuring compression ratios (CR).  

What the articles don't tell me is what CRs I should shoot for to run
on 93 octane street gas.  Of course, the next question is how to
juggle the configuration of stroker crank, con-rod length and piston
height to achieve the desired upgrade in performance without smacking
heads, or as you pointed out, getting interference on the big-ends.

I recall a fairly recent article in Excellence that mentions stroking
and I need to delve into that.  

Thanks again, any further comments and suggestions would be welcome.

Happy motoring, Ray.
