Subject: Tail Lights Revealed!/Repair Window Switches/Sunroof Problem

Mine has just failed! The mechanic has said that one of the teeth in the =
gearbox [that is in the roof (inside the roof lining)] has snapped off. =
This means the limiters that control the amount of travel on the roof =
mechanism - i.e. how much the roof motor can turn the cable  before auto =
stopping - are now not set correctly.  This also effects the sensors =
that allow or prevent movement when you operate the sun roof switch - it =
would appear you are compensating for this by moving the roof slightly.  =
The good news is that the replacement gear is only a few cents.  Better =
still maybe it is just your sensor that has failed.  The bad news in my =
case is that the roof lining has to come out.  Also the cable has =
unwound itself from the roof motor as well, on the rear left bulkhead.   =
I will read with interest any other replies you get as my special =
mechanic will do this for me and it even he has not had this fault it =
before.  I have spoken to a Porsche garage and they say the cable can be =
replaced easily, and the limiters are located in this motor. =20
