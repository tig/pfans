Hi,

On the July 4th weekend I went to Muir Woods in San Francisco area 
across the Golden Gate Bridge with my newly brought 87 951.
I was crusing up and down the road and were making those
sharp turns on the way there.  The car handling was excellent
and I enjoyed driving it very much.  While on the way back to 
San Franscisco before passing the Golden Gate Bridge, traffic
got so bad that basically everyone was driving stop and go 
traffic at 5mph on a 25 degree incline hill for about 20 minutes.
And here comes the nightmare......... White burning smell smokes
starting to come out from my 951.  First I thought it was the VW
in front of me but then after some stares from the cars around me
I realized my car was leaving behind a huge cloudy white smoke.  2 cars
behind me were so freak out that they immediately pulled to my left
At the same time, while releasing my clutch the whole #$#@@
car starting to shake like San Francisco had another earthquake 
again!!!  

Forturnately I was almost at the tip of the hill when all these
things happened. Then I basically avoided to engage my clutch and
let the car run at neutral while going downhill.  The smoke stopped
on the way going downhill. 

I've driving stick shift before and never experienced a burn clutch.
With the above situation, I don't think I can burn my clutch with 
the 25 degree slope.  My guess would be some oil (motor/brake/steering)
fluid got inside the clutch and created that huge burning smoke
while the uneven friction surface with oil on the clutch caused the car
to vibrate when I released my clutch.  Hope all the experts out
there can help me solve this mystery.  

By the way, the Bauer Porsche mechanic says I have a leaking
steering rack, could the leaking power steering fluid got into
the clutch?   

I felt kinda bad when my wife(951) create that embrasse white
smoke.  I wouldn't feel so bad if I am driving a junky car.

Many Thanks!!!!!

Tom,
