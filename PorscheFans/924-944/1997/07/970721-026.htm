The 968CS was voted Sports Car of the Year here in the UK (I forget the year , 
but when it was a current model) and personally I think its a better car than 
the turbo.

I have a 968 Sport , its somewhere between the 968 and the CS . 
Having had a 944s2 before the 968 , I was very suprised in the overall 
difference between the two. Sitting behind the wheel its all very similar , but 
from the moment you start it up you know you have a different car .
The engine pulls even stronger at low rpm (no turbo lag either ...) and spins 
more smoothly , but still has a bit of a surge at around 4000rpm and doesn't 
let up until the red line , probably beyond . It also sounds better .
The steering is more precise , and I think perfectly weighted where as my 944 
never had the same kind of feedback. 
I now prefer the overall look of the car , but it it take a while to grow on me 
and I must admit to not being sure for quite a while.

Values of ALL porsches seem to be on the up in the UK lately , hope it stays 
that way !

How many 968 fans do we have out there ?
