Lee,

I spent a bit of time researching the infamous tow eye.  After striking out
with the purveyors of slightly used parts, I tried the industrial hardware
suppliers.  I broadened my search by enlisting help from several of the
purchasing agents I deal with.  I thought we had found it even though the
thread pitch did not make sense.  I figured they must measure metric
threads differently and ordered the part for $11.  It was the right
diameter but the threads were wrong.  Sneaky Germans did it to me again.

Join PCA and you will get a discount at the dealer.  The eye cost me thirty
something dollars.  We probably expended $500 worth of time trying to save
$20.  However if my Panzer tank ever gets stuck, I have a metric tow eye
for it.
