I do not know where you are living, but I have devised a hypotheses that
all left lane drivers come from Ohio.  I have transversed this state a few
times and it seems that the numbers support a Boltzman's curve distribution
(bell shaped statics curve) as you cut across the state.

Now that I live in Ohio I have formed a more practical hypotheses that
seems to accurately explain this phenomena.  It goes something like this:

Many people like top drive at a steady pace.  Most of those are traveling
at speeds that are different than the trucks (professional drivers) that
mostly occupy the right most lanes.  Since the average speed of right lane
vehicles vary over a wider range (due to trucks slowing and speeding up),
it is simpler to move to the left lane and drive at a speed that is
constant (usually it follows the mathematical formula => Speed Limit - 8.5
mph).  Furthermore, left lane drivers can ignore vehicles going faster as
they are crazy drivers and undeserving of respect.  The principle goes like
this.  "I refuse to acknowledge faster drivers as they are pathological
morons that weave left and right through traffic.  Anyone that weaves lane
to lane between traffic is both unsafe and irrational, therefore, should be
ignored.  Unless, of course, they are driving a 50 megaton loaded dump
truck".

This generally leads to the observation that cars that are moving faster
and weaving side to side tend to get around those vehicles in the left lane
any way,  so moving to the right is unnecessary in the first place.  Beside
the fact that turning the steering wheel in most cars is nothing more than
a request to turn and "I do not want to have to reset my cruise control
again.  It took me ten minutes to get it just right...  Oh, oh, what's
this?  A Burger King!"  At which time they neglect to use their turn
signal, switch lanes, and promptly get run over by a 50 megaton loaded dump
truck.

This causes yet another curious phenomena called rubber necking.  However,
we leave that explanation to a later time.
