<<  Any opinions? Is the S worth the extra
 money? Is the S better/more fun to drive with
 the 16 valve engine? Are the brakes
 better/different? I'm looking for a good, fun
 car to use as a summer toy/every other day
 driver. :-)
 
 Looking for any guidance and opinions
 please...

Hi Eric,  as the owner of an 87 944-S, I would say that it is a really nice
car
and is a little faster than the 86 944, especially at the higher RPM's where
the 16v motor really starts to sing.  However, I do not think I would pay
$6,000. more for it.  Maybe $1,000 to $2,000 more is more reasonable.

Maintenance on the 16v seems to cost a lot, and you need to have someone
familiar with the 16v motors work on them.  They are different in many ways
from
a 'normal' 944.

My opinion only....
