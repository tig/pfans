And then Keith R. Hanson replied:

SEVENTEEN POUNDS? When asked how long your head gasket will last, do you
say, "17 minutes, Timex watch"?

Seriously, though, how long have you been running such boost levels? What
other modifications have you made to insure the reliability of your motor?
How hard do you run it (track events or street only), and how often?

And more to the point, can you quantify the performance of your cars in
terms of measured horsepower and/or acceleration? Spinning tires are
impressive and all, but I think most of us are more interested in
measurable performance gains.

Thanks,
