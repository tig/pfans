John: I would rather trust my 944 to go a coupla thousand miles longer
without scheduled maintenance than have a bad shop work on it. I did ask
Chris to fit me into his busy schedule, but if he told me the payoff for
the "favor" was shoddy/incomplete work I would have driven to Denver on
a song and a prayer! Pat Moyle's shop here in Denver is equally swamped
if not more, with Pat's race stewarding schedule, and they did not do me
any "favors!" I know you also had your own suspicions about Chris's shop
and its quality of work.

After having work done at Dave Cooley's shop in Great Falls, MT, perhaps
I was expecting a level of expertise, courtesy and conscience that is
unreasonable, of Chris's German Auto (Dave is a personal friend). On the
other hand Pat Moyle's shop certainly has its act together so I would
still tend to think that Chris cut some unacceptable corners working on
my car. As for revenue, a 911 can certainly bring in more revenue than a
944 for equivalent work (what was that figure for an oil change?!) and
there is certainly a prestige issue, kind of the Porsche-shop
counterpart of the controversy that this list flogged to death last
month (Air-cooled vs. Water-cooled, or Is The 944 a Real Porsche??).

I know you live in the Seattle area so if you happen to be at Chris's
please let them know about the '84 944 they sent out of the shop on a
2000 mile trip running on a cam belt at 5.0 and emissions enough to kill
a horse at idle! I will not contact the shop again. Thanks.
