You can drive up to 110 degree whithout problem, but it is inposible to
reach it!!!

This is only a marketing srategie from Porsche manager W.Wiedeking"only
911 or somthing like 911 is Porsche"

There is a 800 and 1000 HP 928 engine for the powerboat racing.There is
also 500 and 600 HP with kompressor or twin turbos 928engines in Europe.

There is a 335HP 968 stock engine, and a 360HP 968 racing engine.
A 924 944 or 968 must be less powerfull than the 993 tt.
The 302 HP 968 turbo was very fast : 0-60 4.3sec   top 284KM/H.

Nobody want to buy 968 or 928 in Germany.Only USA, England, and
Australia was a market for this cars.
In Germany  we say: the 944 is the best Sportwagen but it is not a 911 (
that means it is not a real Porsche)


By the way the new Porsche is also watercooled
"Watercooled engines is not a crime"
