OK I must apologize. I misread Farzaan's post because I was losing my
sight and objectability due to the inundation of "GRP" messages. I
thought Farzaan was berating Kincaid for makeing statements while their
951 was not well tuned. This was not the case. Farzaan was refering to
folks making statements about the longeveity of enhanced 951's without
experience. (I could get myself in hot water by mentioning that Farzaan
has a limited amout of time and milage on his 951 upgrades).
Being from a "racing " background (Not meant to be a snobby statement)
the term "Reliable" may mean something different to me that other list
members. I have seen many hot rodded car (Not just 944s) that were
reliable on the street develope problems at the track (I should qualify
'track' as a road racing venue). While dyno testing is a great tuning
benchmark (BTW - nice graphs Farzaan) the final results (in my opinion)
need a real life test. I suppose that it is really up to the driver what
that real life test is. If you live in the city then drag racing might
be a good compairison. I just happen to live in a county area with nice
curvey roads and not many other drivers (too many deers & other
critters). 
 I do , as I said, enjoy and benefit from Farzaan knowledge and
experiments. I wish that he continues to share the info with the rest of
us on the GRP Flame list..oops I mean the 924-944 list.
As for the track time comment - At no time did I mention that I felt I
was faster or better than anybody, I think that running a track event is
important to anybody who wishes to experience the total capibilities of
their Porsche or any car for that matter. (Jim sounds like a track
junkie too!!)

RECAP - I'm sorry Farzaan, I misread your previous post and semiflamed
you by mistake. Keep up what youre doing. (I would love to see lap times
of you and 'Hansman' to compare your improvments!!)
