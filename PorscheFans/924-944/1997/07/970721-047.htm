Boredom has set in. Every now and then the cost of owning these cars comes
up, here's my 2 cents worth. Yes, it can cost some bucks to drive these cars
but one way to offset this is learn how to do the work yourself. A clutch
costs about 1500-2k to have a shop do, like George B says "2k buys a whole
lotta tools." 
I am by no means a mechanic but in the last 2 years I have learned how to do
the simple things such as oil changes, to complex things like clutches. Over
the last 24 months Barry Lenoble and I ( Barry being the real mechanic here,
but I'm gaining) , with the help of this list and friends have done:

Too many oil changes
Brakes- pads and rotors
Trans axels - Removed and changed fluids
control arms- with new bushings
slave and clutch cylinders ect
rotors
motor mounts
tune ups :caps, rotors, plugs
starters
added sway bars
a/c charges
cooling fan thermo switches
CV joints
Other stuff I can't remember!

This was done on several cars not all ours, thank God. We did it not always
to save money but to learn more about the cars we drive at a buck thirty at
Bridghampton. The majority of the above stuff can be done with a Craftsman
100 piece tool set. The clutch took time and tools, but we learned a great
deal about these cars. You will really appreciate those crazy Germans once
you get a look at what they have built for us (see CV joint).
