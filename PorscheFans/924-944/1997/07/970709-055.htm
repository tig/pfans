Some battery facts:

A healty, fully loaded 12 V lead/acid accumulator (car battery) should
have a voltage of about 12.6 V. This can be measured with a good voltage
meter after letting the battery rest for about 3-4 hours, otherwise the
newly charged acid around the plates will give a false reading (higher
voltage). 

A completely empty battery will have a (rested in the same way as above)
voltage of about 11.2 V (Yes!). Strange thing, the "empty battery" may
start the car, anyway - but make no mistake, it is empty anyway. To
start one needs 200A for about 3-5 seconds, wich is only about 0.35 AH,
no more. During this start, the voltage may go as low as 6-7V, and
recover in a minute or so.     

"Around 12V" may be between 30% and 50 %, depending on the precision of
the voltage meter and if it is 11.8 or 12.2V. The one in the car is not,
understandably, quite up to this, but it will atleast tell if the
alternator kicks in or not. 

The regulator maximizes the voltage to between 13.8 to 14.2 V, to make
sure the battery acid does not overheat. There ar battery charging
regulators that check battery temperature and battery voltage, but the
Porsche (Bosch) is a generator sensing unit with a fixed voltage.

To fully charge a flat battery, a voltage in excess of 13.8-14.2 V may
be needed to quickly charge the battery. Restoring it to about 60% goes
fairly quick, but then the voltage potential between the battery and the
alternator just will be to small for fast charging. This is good, and
bad: Good, because it saves on maintenance (water replenishing) and
does'nt wear out the battery (heat), bad because most Porsches are not
used for driving on and on for hours.  

The last 20 % will therefore take very long time to recharge, and most
starter batteries may never be 'fully' charged after the first time.
Ideally, a regulator should be voltage governing the first 70 %, the
switch to current governing for the rest. But it ain't so. 

What to do:

Basically, two things: If the battery is worn out (3-5 years may be a
reasonable life expectancy number) replace it, and make sure that it is
fully charged when installed. 

If it is OK, but empty, recharge it with a mains battery charger. A 60
AH battery would ideally be charged with a 6A charger, but a smaller one
will do, even if it will take longer time.     

A mains battery charger is a very good tool, and as it may prolong the
life of a battery with 100 %, it is also economical. Keeping the water
(electrolyte, acid) level topped up, so the plates always are wet, is
essential. Dont worry about short time electrical consumers, like power
windows, electrical hatc or locks, but worry about the headlamps, AC fan
and the stereo, gadgets that may soak up the excess current from the
alternator instead of letting it charge the battery.
