	Yes, this can be done. It's (probably) only vinyl back there
	anyway. Quality can be a problem, though. If you go this route,
	make sure you have have it done by someone you trust and/or
	get a good guarantee for the workmanship.

	Huh??!! Who told you that? Mine went south last summer and
	I replaced just the switchh. It wasn't cheap ($189 installed)
	but it sure as hell was cheaper than replacing the whole
	console...

	Not really anything you can do about this. You might try the
	Automotion throttle response cam which relpaces your factory
	model. It's cheap ($40) and gives you a big seat of the pants
	inprovement in acceleration (but doesn't really make the car
	any faster).

	A fair amount. Mine's Azurite Blue.

	Enjoy!
