I disconnected my airbags when I did the a/c
evaporator being that my small son likes to 
ride with me in the front.

I never thought about the huge master warning 
light glowing all the time... what a pain.

I took out the instrument cluster and found the
diode that feeds the master caution from the 
air bag warning light.  It uses the diodes to 
let any warning light feed the big main warning without
lighting up all the rest of the warning lights.
(an electrical check valve)

I believe it is the one on the left end looking 
at the back of the instrument cluster.

I took it and cut one end loose making it 
replaceable later and removed the fasten
seatbelt bulb ( I use my seatbelt, but don't
need it to tell me to wear it!)

It's not the butcher job it sounds like and is a
very cleen fix.  I usually like to leave things
as designed, but  it's nice the way the air bag
light stays on letting anyone know they are
inop without lighting the master warning light!

The rest of the important warning lights 
ie oil press and level etc etc still
light the master warning (unlike if I had
just removed the annoying master light), 
and if I reconnect the bags and reset the
bag box the smaller warning still works 
as advertised!

Hope this helps!

If you want to try it and have any questions
write me and I'll add any missing details!
