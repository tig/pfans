<<Just a note on this CV dea:

Loctite and grease-free threads are not the final answer here.  I've
used
both and still had bolts back out.  The ultimate insult on this whole
thing
came last Saturdayy at an AX at Candlestick when I busted a CV joint.

My main point is this:

Of course it is smart to clean the threads on both the CV bolts and the
drive
axle flange, and use Loctite red compound.  However, the CV's take one
hell
of a beating, particularly on bumby tracks or in bumpy parking lots like
we
have at the 'stick).  In conjunctionwith the aforementioned partial
remedies,
check these rascals frequently.  I have my car up in the air 2-3 times
per
week for one reason or another, so I check often.>>

Hmmm... It worked for me. Then I'd safety wire the bolts...

It also looks like there is a real problem with 944 transaxles on
autocrossers. I always heard they are supposedly bullet-proof. I suspect
uneven surfaces.
