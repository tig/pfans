Last weekend I replaced the DME unit on my 1982 944 NA as the old one wou=
ld
stumble and die at about 4000 revs. The new one (second hand 150GBP)
transformed the car. I came out this morning started it up, moved it out
onto the road & started looking at why the windscreen washer pump was not=

working. I decided to drive to the local accessories shop to see if they
had a new one, I turned the key the engine fired for a few seconds and
stopped It would turn over but would not fire. The fuel gauge showed 1/4
full but initially Thought it had run out of petrol and put some more in
it, this did not work. I took out the plugs and they were very wet, dried=

them off ran the engine over without the plugs in and fuel came out of th=
e
plug holes. Left the car for half an hour replaced the plugs checked for =
a
spark, OK tried to start the engine using a booster as the battery was
getting a bmit low. Fired maybe once but then nothing, as if it immediate=
ly
flooded. Tried the sae thing with the old DME unit same response- nothing=
=2E
Anybody got any ideas please.
