Ok 
try this: take an old sock stuff it into the air intake and take her out
for a spin. Notice any difference? Now my point is you can still see
through the sock but it ads more restriction. Less restriction = more hp
The air flow sensor (MAF) is a sturdy peice of metal thats hinged, its
job is to check and measure air flow. With the boost turned up to 16 or
17 lbs and the injectors flowing at max the maf needs to let more air in
it would seem that modifying the intake would do this. This is not
something written that I am following just a hunch. And the results are
in the runs. With 17 inch 40 17's in the rear the car does not hook up
until 4th gear. Try that with a stock 951! Just an opinion.
