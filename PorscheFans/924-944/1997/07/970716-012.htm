I started with a list Barry Lenoble sent me before my first event and
have evolved it into this:

* Combination wrenches
* Medium and large phillips and flat screwdrivers
* Medium pliers
* 12" sliding-jaw type pipe wrench
* 1/2" socket and rachet set
* Torque wrench (for wheel lugs)
* Utility knife
* Assorted plastic wire ties
* Tire pressure gauge
* Electric air compressor
* Simple Green cleaner
* Tube of hand cleaner
* Windex
* Roll of high-strength paper towels (the blue ones)
* Duct tape
* Coolant mixture
* Brake fluid
* Oil
* Blanket or drop cloth to spread your stuff out on
* Fold-up beach chair
* Sunscreen
* Couple of garbage bags
* Plastic bag to hold stuff from glove box
* Lots to drink in an ice chest
* Driving clothes (light colored long tee for summer, long pants)

Maybe some other stuff I can't think of. I put everything into a plastic
Rubbermaid utility box, tools in the bottom.

I have never needed any of the tools except for the torque wrench and you
probably won't either. They're lucky that way.

You won't have any problems. When you get the car on the track you will know
it belongs there!

When it is really hot I have worn a pair of running shorts under my long
pants or suit. Between runs you can slip out and be comfortable. Depending
on the routine at your event you will probably spend the first morning in
instruction, walking the track or just waiting around, so arrive at the
track dressed cool.

Have a great time, but beware: this stuff is addictive!
