I too learned of this traumatic experience...(replacing the rear speakers in
my '86-44)

You're never gunna get what you want out of those little 4x6's. The only way
to go is a sub-woofer and additional amp. There is a subwoofer available
(Fosgate, perhaps?) that fits neatly into the spare tire center. I don't
suggest it though. It's perfomance is lame. 

I'm getting ready to go the sub-woof way within the next few weeks. I've
checked pricing though, which is frightening. $300.00 for the amp, and $250.
for the woof.
That pricing is sans install too!  But I have heard the difference and it's
massive.

I dunno what your pushing with now, but I have a SONY 35wX4 chan. CD, that
works well. It just lacks the bass-balls which the woofer will provide.

Happy listening!
