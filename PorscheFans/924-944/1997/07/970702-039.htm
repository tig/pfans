The symptoms you describe are symptoms of motor mount failure, 90% on t=
he
righthand side. On the outside everything looks ok=E9, but you should b=
e able
to spot some fluid or a difference in hight between the left and right
mount.
Another reason for the same symptoms is when one of the cylinders is no=
t
working 100%. You will feel vibration at idle, smoothing out at higher =
revs
and a reduction in overall performance is hard to notice. It is easy to=

check by disconnecting one at a time the connectors from the injectors =
at
idle and compare changes in effect on idling.
In my case one of the cylinders gave less reduction in idling speed tha=
n
the other three, compression on that cylinder was low and it turned out=
 to
be a broken piston ring in that cylinder.

Same on my '81 924. Vibrates below 1000 RPM, disappears completely abov=
e.
Gets worse when fan kicks in (not AC). An acquaintance of mine who is a=

mechanic took a quick look at the mounts, and said that there was no wa=

they were gone. Note that this was only a quick look under the hood, no=

thorough under car inspection. Could it be anything other than the moun=

or could the mounts be shot without showing any signs of it?
