Farz,
  I don't have the time to start dumping codes for chips.  I could crawl
back under there, rip up the floor board take them out, have them tested
by Ferry himself and then maybe just maybe with his consent or
authorization he could say these are real. There are other hp gains out
there other than the ones you feel work for you. With all due respect
Farzann, there are 1500 members out there, all of whom do not drive only
with the modifications that you recomend and endorse. I know what I have
done to my 951 works
for me. Since I have been on the list I have heard you refer to the K&N
filter as useless also. This is a company that supplies filters to
thousands, maybe millions of  people looking for that extra 5 hp. I
suppose that this is part of an large scam
in the filter business that only you have proven not to be effective.
Let me guess it started with a simple check on the dyno. Like I have
stated before I dyno my car on the street sidestepping the clutch at
3,000. Tell my adversary's that my filter doesn't work the chips are
stock, the Bosch rising rate fuel pressure doesn't do annything,the k27
is really a hair dryer etc.etc.
They will probably only have one ? Why am I looking at his tail lights.
