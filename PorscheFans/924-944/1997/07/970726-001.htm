Whew! been waiting for days to post again...didn't want to add to the
GPR mayhem!

Firstly thanks to everyone who added their opinions to the 'should I
buy a 951 or a 968' question.  I bought the 968.  I just LOVE the look
of that car!...shame about the turbo but you can't have
everything..its still several classes above my 944S, quicker,
smoother, and much more fun to throw around the country lanes. Anyway
thanks again to all you helpful PorscheFans.

I now have two questions..

I am due to have a clutch replacement in the 968  and am being quoted
different figures by differnt workshops.  I know using a genuine
Porsche part is going to be the most expensive option but I have been
told by one mechanic that only genuine clutch parts are available for
the 968 (in the UK anyway).  Apparently Sachs are not allowed to sell
the generic part yet as with other models and it still has to come in
a Porsche box with a Porsche price tag.  Another workshop quoted me a
price for a pattern part clutch from LUK (I think thats how you spell
it) the first mechanic(getting confusing now) said that LUK clutches
were rubbish and I shouldn't fit one.  However the ppl wanting to sell
me the LUK said that LUK promise to supply clutches for all makes of
car and as they can't make a Porsche 968 clutch the buy one from
Porsche, put it in their own box and sell it as a LUK clutch but at
two thirds of the cost.  Does any of this make sense? has anyone else
experienced this problem.  any answers would be gratefully received.

Also could anyone confirm..does the 968 clutch have the center rubber
donut like the 944 clutches?  and does this fail in the same way as
the 944's did?  If so is there an alternative?

Final question for the moment...OK I now have a 6 speed box.  So where
is 'top'?  is it fourth and 5 and 6 are above 'top' or is 5 now top
and 6 where 5th usually is..its all so confusing.  If I am belting
round the country lanes or tooling round the city in 4th am I actually
driving in the equivilant of 3rd everywhere?  It seems to pull like a
mad thing in 4th and I am hoping this is the 1:1 ratio so I can pat
myself on the back and say 'you didn't need the turbo after all' :))
