Bob:

Been there. Changing T bars involves time, it's a lot of work. Changing the
sway bar is easy. Barry Lenoble and
I changed my rear sway bar on my '86 951 in about 15 min. I ordered mine
from Jason at Paragon (Weltmister about $250.00), came with everything. My
car would understeer real bad (push) prior to the bar, after the bar I can
dial in whatever I want understeer/oversteer. To offset part of the cost of
the new swaybar you can sell your stock bar (18mm) and bushings to someone
who doesn't have one, or someone with a Turbo S. The Turbo S came with a
bigger T-bar and a smaller rear sway bar, 16mm.
