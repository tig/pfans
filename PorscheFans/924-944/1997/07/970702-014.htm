Yes it is a strange moonroof/removeable roof.  Doesn't really have much of a
purpose either (well, I don't think so).  To remove it, turn the ignition key
to the first indent (very important), push the up part of the button, wait till
the noise stops, unclip and remove.  (this unlocks the sunroof)  Installation
is reverse except you push the down part of the button to lock it in place.

DO NOT try to remove the sunroof any other way.

Sounds normal to me.  When my A/C is on it clicks (cycles) all the time.

You probably don't want to know the 0-60 of the base 944.  I think it is about
7.9 seconds.  I couldn't tell you if your 325 was faster or not.

You have the "phone dials."  Chrome them polish them, whatever you want.  You
could just get them repainted.  I don't know what would be the most economical
solution.

MORE GAS MORE GAS...  :)

I really don't know about this one.  Could be a variety of problems or could be
not problem at all.  Also there doesn't seem to be enough info.  Have some one
who owns/knows a 944 drive your car.
