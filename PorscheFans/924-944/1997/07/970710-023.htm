A 944T can be run at 17lbs of boost on the street with no problem.  Or,
if the KLR system is still in the loop, you can run a 17lb spike (Paul's
car spikes to 16psi, then drops after the KLR says uh-uh).  But, to
be really fast, you'd need to get a different mapped KLR chip that
allows higher boost pressure and that's where the problem with most
of these modified cars comes.

My gut feeling (Hansman, you can correct me if I'm wrong) is that he
is using a bleeder valve set at 17psi, APE chips, and a 3 bar FPR.
Maybe a wide fire ring head gasket?  If that's all the mods, I'd
say the car would be perfectly safe on the street, but at a 50-lap
track event going 100% all day, I don't know if it would survive.

My goal with this car is to build real, reliable HP, the type that will
last an entire track season, not just one sessions or 5 laps.  I had
that with my Talon, sure it ran 12.7, sure it blew the doors off
every V-8 I could find on the street (no slicks=no go), and sure
it made me a very poor man every time it blew up.
