Hello Fans:

My buddy has a '88 944NA and has a no start condition this morning. We
believe that the fuel pump is to blame, after following the Haynes technique
to the letter. Our only problem is that I believe that the last part of the
procedure outlined by Haynes is for an earlier 944. The '88 does not have a
relay for the fuel pump, and they tell the reader to install a jumper wire
between the relay terminals. 

My question is, with the cap and ball removed from fuel rail and hose
installed, fuse installed, with the key in the run position it should fill
the graduated cylinder? We are getting nothing from the hose.  Any
ideas/experience with the trouble shoot would be helpful. Thankyou in
advance.
