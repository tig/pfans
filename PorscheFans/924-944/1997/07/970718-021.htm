Please give me a break!  The FACTORY ran these cars at 300hp in a racing
series, a series where they want their cars to be reliable and fast.
Sure, you may blow a head gasket if you put in some crappy gas or just
from wear and tear.  Sure you could burn a piston if you run 30lbs of
boost, but if you take care of the car, use appropriate fuel and know
what you are doing (as I feel the members of this list do), there
is no reason why you cannot have a 100% reliable 300 flywheel HP 944T(S).

Now, if I remember correctly, you have a pre-88(S) model, in which case,
300HP will be much more difficult to attain without turbo upgrades, etc,
but on an TS model with the bigger turbo, 15psi will give you 300 flywheel
HP and 300ft-lbs of flywheel torque.

>looking at cars originally designed in '77 or so (the fact that they are

The key thing you wrote there is "originally designed".  You forgot that
the entire engine/drivetrain assembly was updated in the late 80's.  There
is an excellent article in Up-Fixen about the upgrades done to the normal
944 to make it Turbo worthy.  Some of the technology used in this engine
is still years ahead of the competition.  Did you know that a C$60,000
Supra does not yet have the coolant pumper after shutdown?  Did you also
know that the 944T is the first production car I've ever seen that
has ceramic coated exhaust ports.

The grip will be better in a Firebird?  I don't know about the normal Turbo
models, but the "S" models have some serious grip around the track and
street.  I'm reluctant to change anything in the suspension and we all know
that I like to change everything.  I get very concerned when people, who
have had no experience running their cars at levels above stock make
comments about longetivity based solely on what someone told them.

I'm sorry to say, but you just don't understand what modern really is.
I look at key areas of the 944T that still haven't made it into other
production turbo cars that make it more modern:

1. The front mount intercooler is absolutely huge in this car.  You need to
   spend US$1000 to install a front mount on most Japenese cars *and* you
   will then have overheating problems with that setup, whereas with our
   ancient cars, the airpath for the rad and intercooler are seperate.
2. The exhaust ports are ceramic coated to keep the heat in the ports to
   give the turbo more efficiency.
3. The turbocharger is on the other end of the engine to promote turbo
   longetivity and to cut down on the amount of heat transferred from the
   turbine shaft to the compressor shaft.
4. The 12" rotors on the front of my car are still larger than a comparable
   RX-7 T and the calipers are 4-piston on this car compared to dual on
   almost every other comparable car.  
5. There are still no other production cars in this range that has height
   adjustable suspenion from the factory.  I guess those things are just
   too ancient for new car manufacturers to install.
6. The turbo cooler is the best engineering idea I've ever seen and the
   other manufacturers still haven't copied it.
7. The 50/50 weight distribution with the poler moment of inertia is now
   being copied by the Corvette.  Wonder what those engineers were thinking
   when they copied an ancient design!
8. The exhaust system design is a work of art to a power hungry person like
   myself.  Go and try sticking a broom up a Supra's exhaust and see how
   far in you can go.  Can you say backpressure?

I can go on and on, like the way my sport seats hold me in place or the 
dash board's nice layout, the clear dials, the smooth shifter, the perfect
placement of the pedals (only when going full-out), the late activating ABS,
etc, etc.  Just to be fair to you and to the other readers, the 944T is
not perfect, no car ever is.  There are small things that would need updating
because the technology just wasn't there back in the 80s.  For example:

1. The CBV does not seem to have the capacity to handle the higher boost
   of the modded cars.  This is not Porsche's fault, turbo cars in the 80's
   didn't even have CBV's!
2. The flapper door should have never been considered as an air metering
   device, but they really didn't have the hot wire system back then, so
   once again, just a technology change.

That's about all that I can really feel is wrong.  The water pump and
other trouble areas like that are based 100% on owner maintenance.

>machine, if the design can't fulfill your needs you need to get
>something else. The new Corvette, for all the fun we can have with

Or, you can improve on what you have.  I remember reading about something
in Porsche history.  The saying went something like this:

It's easy to replace, difficult to improve.  I intend to improve.

>plastic car jokes, is beautiful and looks very impressive.  The next
>year Firebirds will have all aluminum 300+ HP stock engines...  The
>world has caught up to us, but can't repalce us.

You seem to contradict what you say in that last line, I'm not sure what
you mean, but whatever the case, if you like your car stock, heck, I'm
all for it, just don't make comments on areas you don't have personal
experience with.  Sorry to be rude, but my skin is only so thick!

Farzaan.
