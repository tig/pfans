     I keep my Tonneau on all the time (the top NEVER goes up :-), but the 
     very few times I have had to take it off I have had no problems 
     putting it back on. Of course, mine is 944, but I would imagine the 
     design is pretty similar. I just put the cover down behind the 
     windscreen and under the seats as usual.

Ok, so I went out and bought a 968 windscreen from Sonnen as was 
recommended here on these pages over the last few weeks.  Just as 
everyone said, the windscreen works great. Significantly less noise and 
wind.  I can see how it will prolong the open air season for my cab.
     
However, I can no longer get my top cover on (did someone call it a 
tonneau?)  I don't think this is a big deal because frankly, I think the 
cover is more cosmetic than functional regardless of what the manual says, 
however, it would be nice to use if it can be put on easily.  Has anyone 
successfully used the windscreen and the cover at the same time?
     
Thanks in advance.
