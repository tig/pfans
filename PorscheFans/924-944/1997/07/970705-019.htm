Hi there,

Developing my 924S for SCCA and P-car events, I've run into a need for a 7Q
ltd slip diff.  Any sources known?
Also, I'm thinking of trying a hotter coil and want to know if there are
any pitfalls in putting more voltage into the distributor.  Should I use an
8 ohm ballast or can I just go with the 35,000 peaking MSD coil?  And the
BRAKES!   OH MY!  I'm sorry, but the Porsche brakes are very soft.  I've
got two 924Ss, and both have long travel in the pedals with little firm
feedback.  I've previously competed in Corvettes, MR2 turbos, BMWs, hell,
I've done a few laps in a 993 too... even Neons have better brakes than
this...  What's up?  I've tried metal master pads and a new brake master
cylinder with little result.  I need something that gives quick effective
stopping power.  Is the power brake booster in these cars simply "soft"?

Thus far, I've lowered the car to the extent of the M030 suspension
adjustments, keeping the car level, and added a 28mm Weltmeister bar with
adjustable drop links tuned to the soft ends of the bar.  Feels about like
a 26mm bar at this level.  I'm running KONI sport yellows and the car is
very well balanced, but feels underpowered and lacking brakes.  Still, I'm
faster than every 944 and 924S I've met at the track thus far.  Still,
people who know how to go faster than me are out there in droves, so any
other simple, legal, and effective performance tips would be welcome.

I already know that most work needs to go into the nut behind the wheel,
but I'm looking to max out my metallic outer self as well...  I missed the
Porsche Parade, but the SCCA Nationals are just around the corner, and I'd
like to dial in the car ASAP.

Thanks very much in advance,

Rich Fletcher
