I recently purchased a 1989 944T and love it.  One morning after
starting the car, I experienced a problem getting it into reverse.
Since I am a new Porsche owner, I though nothing of it.  I just engaged
and dis-engaged the clutch a couple of times and eventually got it in
gear.  A few days later, I had the same problem trying to get the car
into any gear!  I had no idea what the problem was.  I tried everything
and eventually turned off the engine and tried it.  Wha-la!  It went
right in with no problems.  I talked to a service manager at my local
Porsche dealer and he said I needed a new clutch and it would cost about
$2000.00!  He further explained that one of the small springs in the
clutch had broke and it was causing the clutch not to fully disengage.
This is an intermittent problem now, but I'm not sure for how long.  The
problem only occurs when the car has been turned off.  I have no problem
shifting while driving.  I don't want to cause any additional damage to
the car by not replacing it if it is broken, but $2000.00, WOW!  So, my
questions are: 1) Does this sound realistic for a car with 39,000 on it?
 2)  Can anyone recommend a really good mechanic (should be cheaper than
a dealer) to replace my clutch in the Phila. PA area. 3)  It there
anything else I should consider changing at the same time as a
precaution.  Any help would surely be appreciated!
