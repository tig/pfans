Marv, I don't know if this is related to your changing coolant levels, but
the other day when I decided to bleed the coolant system on my car, I went
out and purchased a new expansion tank($$). My old tank had seen better days.
When I purchased the new tank, I looked it over and found out that it has a
one way flap in one of the inlets. (the inlet nearest the rad. cap). When I
took my old tank off, sure enough it had the flap, but it was stuck in the
open position, I could move it to the closed postion with a screw driver. I
don't know if internal pressure in the system was enough to make it close,
but the one in the new tank flipped-flopped alot more freely. Tha flap looks
like it will allow coolant back into the tank, but not allow it to go out the
same way. Maybe some of the P-fan experts can explain exactly what the
function of the flap is. Colin F. '89 951
