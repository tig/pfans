Be careful.  One problem area with the 944 series is that the rear glass
will seperate from the frame.  Someone wrote in a while ago stating that a
cause of this is due to letting the hatch just glide to the top unassisted.
 Not sure its true but its not worth taking chances.  One observation I've
had is that it is too easy to torque the rear glass.  I always make sure I
close the hatch from the center to make certain I'm not twisting the hatch
by pressing one side down further than the other.
