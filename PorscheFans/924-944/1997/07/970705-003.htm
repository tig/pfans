Recently I had the head gasket replaced on my 89 944 Turbo with the wide
fire ring gasket.  At first I thought that my coolant level was rising, but
more careful observations have determined that it is actually doing the
opposite.

I have been marking the level every two days now, first thing in the
morning, with a cold engine and coolant.

The level has been consistently dropping by 3/8" every two days.  The car
now has about 160 miles on the gasket and I have not used the "turbo" that
much, but when I get it going, I seem to smell some coolant (subjective) in
the air when I do.

The reservoir cap is new and there are no drips seen anywhere under the
car.  I would assume this is an abnormal situation for the turbo to loose
coolant on a regular basis.  I think I will do an oil change to look for
coolant and oil mixing too.

I wanted to hear from the group first before I return the car Monday to the
service shop that performed the work.  I think I have amassed enough
evidence to show that something is abnormal.

Any thoughts or wisdom anybody?
