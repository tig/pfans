What a day, I didn't use the car over the weekend. I did fix the hatch, the
release button had failed. I put in a new one and was surprised that the hatch
actually lifts completly up when the button is pressed (the hatch never worked
since I got the car). Neat!

This morning I go to start the car and it just turns and turns. So I did the
following:
Made sure that the engine was indeed turning.
I checked the spark plugs: They are working okay.
Checked the fuel Pump. It appears to be pumping, though, I don't have a
pressure guage to know how well.
I checked the injectors: With the ignition on they have 12v on both terminals.
Is that normal? The manuals only state 12v on terminal 2.

That leaves the DME and to check if there are any pulses ( I plan on connecting
a diode accross the terminals to see if it flashes/melts!?). Otherwise why
wouldn't a car turn over if it has sparks and fuel unless the injectors are not
working?

The one thing that I am wondering about is the alarm. I triggered it yesterday
when I started on the hatch. The handbooks state that a car can't be started
with the alarm on. How does the alarm disable the engine and how can I check
this. Even the workshop manuals don't seem to mention the alarm (I have the key
on the side version).

I only have tonight to fix it, or else its being towed to a local shop. So if
you have any ideas, please send them to me directly.

Thank you.
Robert, 944 S (87)
