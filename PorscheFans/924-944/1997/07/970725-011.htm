So, in other words we can use just about anything we want!  There has =
been
much debate in this list about whether to use GL4 (which the owner's
manual says) or to use GL5.  It now seems that either type is OK.

If I were putting in Redline I'd opt for either the 75w/90 gear oil which
is GL5 or MT90 instead of the MTL.  MTL is 75w/80 (equivalent to 10w30
motor oil), which may be fine, but for my son's turbo a little extra
protection couldn't hurt.  MT90 is like 10w40.  I use MTL in my '92 Honda
Si and it has improved the shifting greatly.

You don't need to do this with the synthetic varieties.  They pour like
water and are very easy to install.

Thanks for the procedure and safety tips.
