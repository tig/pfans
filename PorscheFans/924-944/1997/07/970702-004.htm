When anyone has a question on purchasing a car, especially one like this,
you can get those answers directly from the PCNA (Porsche Cars North
America) in a matter of minutes.

Their number is 800 545-8039.

This assumes that you are buying a car in the USA, of course.

>I came across a 1990 944cab. with 23,000mi.  The price
>is very good.  It needs a radiator and thats it.  Does the
>car share the same radiator as the Turbo?  Anyway upon further
>inspection I began to notice a few things.
>First it had no airbag.  I thought this was standard?
>The dealer said it had never been hit.  How can one tell
>if a car has been hit before?  Also is this just an early
>'90 with no airbag?  I also noticed that the spacing
>between the left front fender and door is not equal.  Can
>that be adjusted?  Ok now onto the engine compartment.
>The engine bay is very mint.  No sign of repair.  Just
>perfect and clean.  However I did notice that the VIN#
>was etched on the inside of the hood, fenders,and trunk.
>Again the dealer had no answer.  Another item I saw was
>a service sticker, but it was not in english,  It had some
>european phone #.  This makes me very curious.  Maybe this
>car is a euro-model.  What is the difference
>between U.S. model and the Euro version?  Maybe the original
>owner was in the military and brought this baby over, is
>this possible?
>I'm a first time porsche buyer,  so any advice I can get
>would be great.  Send any suggestions, helpful hints to beastie@put.com
>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
