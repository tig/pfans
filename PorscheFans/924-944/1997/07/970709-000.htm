Anything's possible.  If you want to modify you can go as far as 9.0+10.5
with 275/315.  That will take a large hammer to the inner fenders and some grinding
to the camber adjusting bolts.

Normally 8.5+10.0 works well with 255/275.  Offset is approximately 65mm
(2.5")
and may require tweeking the front fenders.  All boides are different and 
some of this depends on how much camber you are running.  I have this setup
on my 951S.

It had better not rub under hard cornering.

You may or may not be able to just bolt thses on.  It depends on the
individual car.  If you are lucky they'll bolt on.  If not - be
prepared.

BFG Comp T/A now makes a R1 drag radial for the cornering impared.  Maybe 
a set of skinnies can be had for the front to minimize drag ;^}

Howdy,

I'm hoping that as the mail server clears itself up, the dyno results will
appear in a digest form so the other readers get to see the results.  I'm
in the process of putting together a website with the dyno graphs on there.

Next item is wheel offsets.  I've been told that the widest wheel/tire
combination possible on a late 944 Turbo is 17x8.5 up front and 17x10 in
the rear with 255/40R17 and 275/40R17 R1's.

1. Is this information correct?
2. If so, what are the offsets of the wheels?
3. How bad does the gearing get affected by this change, can you notice
   the difference?
4. Does it rub under hard cornerning?

It's time to get serious about this racing stuff and get some real 
stickies on my car :)

Farzaan.
