Garry,

I had the same problem on my '83 for a year.  I kept thinking it wat the 
wheel bearings, but two different shops told me the noise was coming 
from the differential.  One shop would replace the bearings for about 
$1000 and the other would replace the transaxle with a rebuilt one for 
about $2500 plus labor.  Since my transaxle has a LSD, I wanted it 
repaired.

Turns out there is little more the average shop can do to the transaxle 
(gears, I suppose) because the of the tolerances required. 

The shop tore the transaxle down, and replaced the bearings, which had 
lost some of the hardened layer on the races.  The mechanic was suprised 
to find so little damage.  When they put it all back together, there was 
still some of the noise.  So they also replaced the wheel bearings for 
the cost of the parts.  These were rough, too, but not brindled.  I also 


had the clutch replaced at this time. The rubber center of the clutch 
was torn.  All was quiet after the extensive repair.  I honestly think 
the noise was coming from both the transaxle bearings and the wheel 
bearings.  The clutch was just icing on the cake.

So my advice is to start with the cheaper thing first.  Check and 
replace the wheel bearings if you think that may be the problem. New 
bearings cost about $100 for the set of four plus labor.  If the noise 
goes away, maybe you don't need to replace the bearings in the 
transaxle.  If it is still noisy, get the checkbook out.

I don't know the implications fron ignoring loud transaxle bearings.  
Obviously a failure would be disastrous, but maybe they will just yell 
at you for a long time before they fail.

Good luck.  Email me directly if you want more details.
