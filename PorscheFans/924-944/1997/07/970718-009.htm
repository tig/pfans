hello, new to the list....  anyway, on the bmw digest, there was some mention
about the 134a.  when installing it in a car that originally came with the
R12, you have to replace with approx. 75-80% of 134a.  134a runs a hhigher
pressure (don't know how to say it technically).  simple math - if your car
takes 2 lbs. of R12, replace it with 1.5 to 1.6 lbs of 134a.  any thoughts on
this.  someday, i know i wil have to switch all my cars.   those that have
done this say they have had no problems.  the reason why the origianl
conversions were blowing up was higher pressures could not be handled by the
original seals. YMMV
