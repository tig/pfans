My 92 968 coupe developed a gas odor in the right rear area several
months
>ago.  I have paid the dealer to check it out twice and then paid an
>independent mechanic about $200 to check it out further.  The latter replaced
>the charcoal cannister, which was full of charcoal powder (apparently it
>should have been full of pellets) and stank like gasoline.  This did nothing
>to help the problem.  I caulked the plastic lid to the fuel pump area on the
>passenger side trunk floor, but this did not help either.  I have decided to
>wait until a real leak develops, which will make it easier to locate.  As far
>as I know, the mechanics have checked every connection in the fuel system,
>without finding anything amiss.  The 2nd mechanic used a hydrocarbon meter,
>and confirmed that the fumes were present before the car starts up in the
>morning.  The nice thing is that the ventilation system removes the odor
>immediately on starting the car, so it isn't a very significant problem.
>
>I will check the drain hose which Stuart Trushkowsky mentioned.  Any other
>ideas would be appreciated.

I had this exact problem.  It drove me crazy.  It only happened when the
tank was full.  The problem was a cracked fuel tank!
