I posted this before, but it was when the server dumped everyone.
I'm looking for a used AFmeter to Turbo boot (the one that looks like a
muscle shell.  It can be damaged, because it is going to be extensively
modified.

     I'm going to check my roof with a magnet later this afternoon.  If it 
     doesn't attract, it's probably safe to assume that all of our sunroofs 
     are made from Bondo.  Anyone care to snap theirs in half to see what's 
     actually in there (I'm starting to suspect the sunroof is made from 
     those special heat-shield tiles from the space shuttle).

I just went down to my '86 951 and *carefully* (don't want to scratch 
that paint!) placed a refrigerator magnet on the roof of the car and 
then on the sunroof panel.  The magnet (a cutout of Dogbert) stuck to 
the roof, but not the sunroof panel.  If it's not fiberglass, then it's 
another non-ferrous material.
