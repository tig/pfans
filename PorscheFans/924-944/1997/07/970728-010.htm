Hi, as I no longer need the net it is for sale.  It is a black
"Teamtec" custom made PCA legal window net specifically
for the 944.

It was purchased from Dougherty's and is in excellent condition,
It has a lower front bracket that fits under the door panel & does not 
interfere with use of the window, and does not require cutting of 
the door panel.  The lower rear attachment requires a small hole for the
"bar" to slide into to be drilled at the bottom of the rear vertical part of
the
window opening.  The upper attachment has a flat metal portion
that slides up into the window channel & requires drilling two very
small holes up through the top of the upper window channel for 
securing,  these holes are never visibile due to their location.

It is an extremely nice package.  For sale $125.00 including shipping
or best offer.  

Thanks,
Jeff Brubaker
