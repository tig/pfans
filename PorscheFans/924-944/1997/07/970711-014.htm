i have never quite understood how an air filter on a chassis dyno can make HP. 
if the car is not moving then it is not really taking in enough air to make much 
if any difference at all. i think that you really wouldnt notice a difference 
unless the car was moving at speed. i.e. the faster the car is moving then the 
more air is rushing in (right?) the more air then the more fuel the car injects 
(right?) the more fuel and air you have then the more HP you should have 
(RIGHT?)  if this is the case then i cant even see how a K&N or any other filter 
could make HP on an engine dyno or chassis dyno!!!

my .02, and it is probably all wrong
