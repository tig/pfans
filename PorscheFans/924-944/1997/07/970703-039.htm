My recently purchased '78 924 uses a lot of fuel too. It idles high most
of the time (between 1200 - 1600 rpm). I haven't had it looked at yet so
can't help you there, sorry. The synchros have gone too I think since
it's hard to change gear without crunching! Oh well I still like it for
my first Porche :)

To all you lucky American readers; I wish Porches were as cheap here in
Ausralia as they are over there!
I nearly had a heart attack when I found out you lot can buy an '89 944
for less than I paid for my old 924 :(
