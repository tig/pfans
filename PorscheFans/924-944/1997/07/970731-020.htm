Pfans,

Before sending your pics off to 'angel' who posted here asking.  You may want to
visit the little 'angel's' website.  The name DANA may lead you to think that
said 'angel' is of the female variety when in fact the 'little lady' was born
with more plumbing than you might expect.  'She' also has a page called 'cute
guys on the net' as well as a Porsche page that has yet to have any pics in it.
There is a section in there on 'Gay Resources' too, but I'm not sure why 'she'
would have that there.  So before sending pics of your favorite car with you
smiling largely in front of it, you MAY want to think about whether or not you
want your pearly whites adorning a page where people may assume you prefer lace
over boxers.  Know what I mean?

Just a friendly warning from the one way only club  :-)
Bill
