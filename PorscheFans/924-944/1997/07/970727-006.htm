I am just wondering if someone can help me.  Are racing seats like the Momo
rookie or a Sparco seat too much to live with day to day, the reason I ask is
because my stock tweed seats need rebuilt and reuphalstered and from what I
can tell it would be cheaper to put in racing seats, harnesses, etc.. I do
intend on auto crossing and taking my car to track days.  Also how hard is it
to totally remove my useless back seat (bottom cushions and all) I would then
have that area carpeted.  And the last thing is who makes the stiffest rear
shocks, the front of my car is stiff and the back is a lot softer and I want
to even it out a little.  Thanks for all the help I have recieved in this
list so far.
