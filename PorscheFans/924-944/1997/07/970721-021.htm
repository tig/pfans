Firstly well done on battling through the archives.

I shall start by paraphrasing my mechanic " Only the 944 turbos were
something special the others, well weren't." As a turbo S owner this one
comment kept a stupid grin on my face all day.

I also had chance to venture onto a dealers lot a few months ago. The
salesman was a one time Porsche racer and generally on the level. There
was a 968 CS ( club sport - factory stripped out light weight special
for the benefit of our North American members) in black. I said I'd
kinda like one of these on day. I was told that I should save my money
as the turbo S was a better car. It was built when Porsche had lots of
spare money and not on the ropes.

If I was in the market for a 968 I would be only after a club sport the
other models don't really have any appeal ( other than a 968 turbo S, I
think they only made 70 though. ) I prefer the exterior styling of the
968s over the 944s again it is a personal choice.

Years from now I think that the value of 944 turbo S cars will firm up
in much the same way that the price of '73 911 RS cars bottomed out at
the beginning of the 80's and then went up. I'm only trying to compare
the two cars by what I see as a trend in prices of rarer Porsche cars. I
am NOT trying to compare them in any other way.


Turbo charged cars, say those manufactured by sports car companies, tend
to be built to satisfy homologation regulations for racing. People often
comment that the engine seems a bit lazy below X-RPM. When racing if
your not hard on the gas or hard on the brakes you are wasting your time
as the saying goes. Yeah the 951 engine is 'lazy' below 3500-4000 RPM
but it is as intrusive as you choose to make it. Having ridden a number
a 2 stroke race bikes over the years I know if I want to accelerate from
60 MPH I have to change down a couple of gears.
The power delivery in a turbo will always be different to a NA car. Its
what you choose to make of it.

I see your point on the 98 cars. I think the Boxster has an ugly nose.
I think the best advice is to buy the newest car you can afford.

Richard.
