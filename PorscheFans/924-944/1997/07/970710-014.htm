Hello.  I am new to the list and I am sure these questions have been asked 
before, so if there is a FAQ that details the information I am seeking, please 
let me know.  

I am considering the purchase of either a 944S2 or a 91-92 968.  I have read 
the car magazine reviews for years on these cars, but I am interested in 
opinions and experiences of real owners.  Especially in the area of 
maintenance routines, common problems areas, low cost performance 
improvements, etc.  This car would be a daily driver, approx. 75 miles round 
trip, of which 60% would be interstate and the rest is nice SMOOTH, CURVY two 
lane county roads.  

I do not want to enter this endeavor blind.  I have been warned by several 
previous owners, about the cost of maintaining these cars.  However, there are 
lemons on every line.  For instance, my previous and current cars have been 
BMW 325's.  I have had no problems with these cars, while I have had friends 
that have had nightmares with them, and will never buy one again.  

I will have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed on the car. 

Information in the following areas would be greatly appreciated:

1.  Approx. price range of a car in good condition?

2.  Any known problem areas with either of these cars / year models (i.e. 
engine, electrical, transmission, brakes, leaks, squeaks, etc.)?

3.  Maintenance routines:
	What is performed at 15K, 30K?
	What is the reasonable cost if done by a trained independent?

4.     If I maintain and treat the car well, how many miles can I expect on 
the engine before a rebuild.  
        What is the price range of a rebuild?	

5.  Are parts still readily available?  I believe the 944S2 was only produced 
two years, 89-90, and then the 968 began in 91.  What year did they stop 
production of the 968?

Please forgive a newbie of his enthusiasm, I could go on and on.  I have been 
a fan of  Porsches for many years, but either did not have the finances during 
college, or in recent years, had three small children and a small sports car 
was out of the question.  But now an opportunity presents itself for ownership 
and the flame has been rekindled.  

TIA

Cliff James
