Hi Michael,

> Considering unmodified cars only, what class do 968s fit in and how does it

The 968 runs in class F, which is made up of 944S2, 944 turbo, 911's
from 84-93 (3.2 Carrera - 964) and Euro SC, 72-73 911S, 85-86 928 S,
and the Boxter. The 944S Club Sport / Firehawk car is also in that class, 
although they're pretty rare.

A 968 Firehawk car would run in E, with 944 turbo S, 95 993, Euro and
club sport  Carrera's, 87+ 928, and some other cars.

The classes are pretty much based on power to weight ratios. The 968
is listed at 3086 lbs, 236 hp, for a lb/hp of 13.08.

I haven't seen enough 968's to know how competitive they are.
