Cris,
  Sounds like your in for the long haul. Anyway when I embark into the
unknown on my 86 951 I use masking tape on every hose, wire and clamp.
I  number the end that came off and corespond with the same # that it
connects with.
This is extremely important with the vac hoses found on these turbo
cars. One misconnect and she'll never be the same. I noticed you said
that sand
fell in to your engine. YIKES!! Before you take anything off that will
expose the innards vaccum EVERYTHING. I use a shop vac with a piece of
garden hose taped to the end. Good luck
