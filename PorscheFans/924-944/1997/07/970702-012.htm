	Well, this is my first post so I have a few questions on my new-to-me 944.
Up until about 3 weeks ago I had a really nice BMW '87 325is. It was great
until it hit a rock in the apex of a turn resulting in me wishing I had
replaced the shocks with Bilsteins. Needless to say, I was shopping for
something more "practical" (I was looking at 535's) and drove by Crevier
BMW. Well, in the sea of pre-owned BMW's I saw a bright red Porsche and
thought I'd "just ask" about it. Well, there's not a scratch on it and the
car is absolutely perfect. I've never seen a used car in better condition.
It only has 73,000 miles on it and the leather shows no wear whatsoever.
The original owner kept a 2-inch binder with all of the maintenance records
and documented everything down to changing a light bulb. All servicce done
at the dealer. I've been told that the best way to buy used Porsche is with
all of the records. I've got a couple of questions though:

	* This car has some strange moonroof / removeable roof. Is this normal?
It's all factory and motorized with clips at the front to remove. 

	* The A/C is extremely cold yet the whole climate control seems strange
compared to other Porsches I saw. It has a temperature knob with centigrade
notation and the compressor cycles on and off. Is this normal?

	* I could only test drive it for 20 minutes or so and despite being a good
250-300 pounds lighter than my 325is it didn't feel faster. I wasn't timing
anything but could this effect be due to the much lower seat height than
325is? My BMW had a chip and almost 140,000mi but it was still very quick.
What is the normal 0-60 obtainable with the 944?

	* It has the 15" "oval hole" style wheels. They are silver but the powder
coat / paint is showing signs of coming off. What are my options? I
personally like the looks of them compared to my old impossible to clean
14" BBS RZ's. Can I have them chromed? Or would polishing be a better idea?
I'm looking for something that both looks good and is cost effective. 

	* This clutch is not as stiff as my BMW and the whole car seems much
easier to stall. (I never did) but I always felt like more gas was needed.
Is this normal? Also, if I didn't make a shift pretty close to perfect.
(matching RPM's right) when I let the clutch out completely the engine
would seem to "buck" and the tack would be oscillating. Is this a clutch
problem? As I said, it only happens when I was grossly off on the shift.
Anything pretty close and there was no problem. 

	* Finally, I'm looking for a good Porsche mechanic is South Orange County
CA. Anybody know of one?
