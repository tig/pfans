This is exactly what Magnecor says.  No ignition wire can ADD power.  All
it can do is deliver the spark that was intended to get there.  If you
have burned out carbon-based wires, just adding a new set of the same
thing will improve the situation.  I believe the real benefits of a wire
such as Magnecor's (and others) is that they are designed to last
virtually forever due to the solid metal to metal spiral windings.  They
are also designed for minimal EMI and RFI which is critical on computer
controlled cars.
