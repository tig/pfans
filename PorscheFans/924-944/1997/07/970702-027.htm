Last week the following comments were made/quoted on the list (I've been
behind on the digests and only read it recently):

>I haven't driven a 968, but I'm sure it's a fantastic car.  The only
bad
>rap against it that I've heard or read comes from the 924/944/968/928
book
>by Vivian.  He said that compared w/ the 3rd en RX-7, the 968 was
>relatively clumsy and almost scary in the corners.  The one RX-7 I've
>driven convinced me it is one of the few cars in the same price range
that
>is comparable or better than the 944 line in handling, and the
acceleration
>is amazing. But Vivian's criticism seems a bit overstated.

I have owned a twin turbo '93 RX7 for the last four years, and in March
of this year my wife acquired a '92 968 coupe.  I had my RX7 at Mid Ohio
for a Rotary SportsCar Club event in May, and on June 20-22 I attended
the NNJR PCA Mid Ohio event with the 968.  For those that are
interested, a comparison of the two cars on the track follows:    

The RX7 is clearly faster as you would expect with 19 more hp and 260
fewer lbs in weight.  I easily got the RX7 up to 130+ mph at the end of
the back straight, while I was only able to get the 968 up to about 122.
This makes a big difference in lap times at Mid Ohio.    

Handling is hard to compare directly since I used street tires on the
RX7 (Goodyear Eagle GSCs which suck badly IMO) and BFG R1s on the 968.
I'll try to compare the two now, but a true apples to apples comparison
will have to wait until I get the RX7 on R1s.  Both cars handle the
esses, the jump turn and right/left combination after Thunder Valley
very well, but the 968 was extremely forgiving while the RX7 was
slightly more twitchy.  Every time I got the 968 out of shape it was
incredibly easy to save.  The RX7 was a little more challenging, and
once coming out of Thunder Valley a little too hot I lifted just a bit
lightening the rear end and spun.  I am convinced that the same maneuver
would have been catchable in the 968.  The RX7 is a very easy car to
drive fast, but the 968 is even easier.  The "relatively clumsy and
almost scary in the corners" comment above is complete bullsh*t and
after three days on the track I have the experience to prove it.  With
R1s I would expect the RX7 to have more grip and higher limits than the
968, but I think it would require a bit more skill to explore those
limits.  

The biggest difference in the two cars is in braking.  The 968 as set up
for the track was by far the best braking car I have ever driven.  On
paper (C&D, R&T etc. comparisons) the RX7 is supposed to have better
brakes, but I just don't see it in practice.  The RX7 was using Hawk
Blue pads on stock rotors, while the 968 was using Porterfield track
pads also on stock rotors.  Both were flushed and bled with new high
temp fluid only days before the events.  The 968 had a much firmer
pedal, was much easier to modulate and simply inspired more confidence
than the RX7.  I'm sure some of the difference I noticed on the track
was due to the R1s, but most of the difference was noticeable on the 968
off of the track with its street tires on (well worn SP8000s).  Also,
the ABS system on the 968 works far better than the RX7 which seems to
lock for a few split seconds before fully engaging.  

Unfortunately with the 968 I was placed in the slowest of the three run
groups since this was my first PCA event, despite the fact that I had
previous Mid Ohio experience in the RX7.  With that said, I was the
fastest car in my run group, blowing by several chipped 944 turbos, a
928 GTS, a bunch of NA 911s and three 911 turbos.  Many cars would leave
me in the dust on the back straight only to be eaten up under braking
and in the turns.  People in my group had a hard time believing that the
car was stock and that I was beating them only with aggressive braking
and awesome handling.  My fastest laps were in the low 1:50s and I was
consistently running high 1:50s and low 1:51s.  I think with some
alignment changes, tire pressure experimentation and some more practice
I can get into the low 1:49s in the 968.  With BFG R1s on the RX7 I am
hoping that I can get into the 1:47s but that improvement will be mainly
due to the RX7's hp and weight advantage over the 968 than any handling
advantage.  

Anyone who says that the 968 is not an awesome handler as in the quote
above is seriously confused.
