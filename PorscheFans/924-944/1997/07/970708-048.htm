Hi PorscheFans.

The following is a VERY LONG message that has very little to do with Porsche.
SO PLEASE SKIP IT IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED.  However, I think many of you,
especially those who are true driving enthusiasts, will find it very interesting
and enjoyable reading, as I did, about the Lamborghini Countach.

Enjoy!

Naweed.

Subject: Lamborghini Countach Owner's Experience (LONG)


WARNING: This post is long with only a bit of Ferrari Content.

A few months ago, several list members asked if I would pass along any
observations I had as I got to know the Lambo I acquired last spring.  With
nearly 4 months and 2500 miles under by belt,  I am just beginning to
understand and appreciate the Countach we purchased in March of this year.
I know this isnt a Ferrari, but Im sure many of you are as curious as I
was as to how this fabled machine drives, owns, and maintains in reality.

A few specifics on the car: it is a 1985 Countach 5000S, Black with white
leather interior, the third model in a series of 5 in the Countach line.  I
bought the car through a dealer in Illinois, and I paid $28,000 plus a 1993
Acura NSX in trade.  Ive been following Countach prices for several years,
and my assessment was it was time to act (much like 308 prices reached a
low 6 months ago).  This was one of 193 5000S models made between 1982 and
1985.  Mine is one of the last dozen produced.  The 5000S uprated the
engine displacement to 4.8L, principally to meet more stringent emissions
requirements and to improve fuel economy (Im getting about 14 mpg in
mostly highway driving).  It is carbed and power is up slightly (to 375 HP)
from the 400S model, though the improvement to the torque range were more
noticeable.  Torque is both higher and broader throughout the range.  The
V12 pulls strongly down to 2000 rpm, and really comes on from 4000 rpm to
the non-rev-limited 8000 rpm suggested redline.  The car I purchased was a
grey-market Euro model with full EPA and DOT releases.  It had one caring
owner (who I talked with extensively pre- and post-purchase) who had put
only 7000 km on the odometer.  A recent service changed all the fluids and
supposedly tuned the 6 Weber 40 DCOE side-draft carbs (more on this later).

I took delivery in late March in the midst of spring New Mexico snowstorm.
When the transport opened up and the black Lambo peeked out from the
trailer, I was in heaven.  Its the kind of thing Ive dreamed about for 20
years since I first became aware of the Countach in the mid-70s. My first
drive was a dream to say the least.  This car is like no other in the
intimidation department.  It took nearly 2 months to grow comfortable
enough to steer with one hand.  But, Im getting ahead of myself.

First, everything youve read about this car is inaccurate!  The myths that
have grown around the Countach are legendary and just plain wrong.  For
starters, the car is very well built.  In my judgement, build quality is
superior to the Ferraris Ive seen and owned.  The Countach is rock-solid,
and there isnt a shake or rattle in the car.  The doors work perfectly and
are a marvel of engineering.  Body roll is minimal, and strangely, there is
a bit more lift and dive under hard braking or acceleration than you might
expect giving the lateral rigidity during cornering.  

The two most impressive handling features of the car are steering and
brakes.  Steering cannot be described.  Ive raced NSXs for two years, and
prior to the Countach, I thought the NSX steering was the best in a
road-going car.  Well, the Countach steering is precise beyond words.  It
is the first car Ive ever driven with NO slop or hunting.  Compare this to
the Ferrari 308 which needs constant adjustment to keep on-center.  The
Countach is the only car Ive driven that holds its heading without the
slightest movement of the wheel.  The steering is heavy at slow speeds (no
power assist), but is moderately light once youre moving.  The Countach
steering transmits precise information about front-wheel grip to the wheel,
but without any kickback over bumps and other imperfections.  The car is
neutral at moderate speed, with progressively more understeer at slower
speeds.  The Countach is sensitive to lift-throttle oversteer, and I dont
yet have the courage to push it through the sweepers at the limits of its
ability.  I havent spun the car yet, so frankly Im not certain how it
behaves just before it loses it.  In comparison, the Ferrari gives plenty
of warning before it rotates while the NSX didnt.  Those two experiences
have left my cautious as I explore the limits of the Lambo.    

The brakes are racing-car caliber.  Ive had the Countach on the track a
few times, and the brakes are very linear and progressive with no fade.
Impending lockup is easily sensed and corrected.  Brake balance seemed just
a touch off with the fronts locking up consistently.  This may be a tuning
issue with the grippier P-Zeros I installed.  The limits of the Countach
are large.  I doubt anyone other than the test drivers can really
appreciate what this car is capable of.  Im a moderately competant driver,
and this car has more than I do.  One BIG problem: the roof line is so low,
you cant fit easily with a helmet on.  Im 5 10", and I have to squat low
in the seat with my knees bent on either side of the wheel in order to fit
during racing.  Tall drivers need not apply.

Mechanically, the car is quite simple.  Standard carbs and Marrelli
ignition.  I had to make up some special adapters in order to fit mercury
tubes (for carb balancing), and I found the prior tuning was way off.  I
refitted the Webers with high-altitude jets, and I dropped the air
correction jet size in order to keep the mixture rich at high RPM (at the
sacrifice of economy and emissions).  We dont have required emission
testing, but since I dont know who may read this, Ill refrain from any
comments on purely hypothetical alterations one could make to the strap-on
emissions equipment which was required for EPA and DOT release.  The add-on
equipment is a rats nest of plumbing and electronics, but once you work
through the idea its within the DIY capabilities of the home mechanics on
this list (essentially exhaust gas taken from the crankcase is recirculated
into the intake manifold in order to lower combustion temperature). 

One problem I noticed early on was a bad (nearly engine-killing) hesitation
on acceleration.  I talked with another 5000s owner who confirmed this
problem, and a re-read of several Countach reviews from 80-85 also
mentioned this trait.  I found that the acceleration pumps on the carbs
werent injecting near enough gas on throttle opening.  Thank goodness for
Webers, since a quick alteration of the pump bypass orifice resulted in
about a three-fold increase in gas delivery on acceleration and completely
eliminated the hesitation.  Now the car really takes off when you hit the
gas!   Ive been asked to write the details of this up for the Lamborghini
Club magazine, as it appears the original carb tuning was a factory
compromise in favor of emissions.  Also, Ive had no problems with
overheating.  Even city traffic in the summer hasnt phased the cooling
system and the only time Ive seen the temperature rise was after hot laps
at the PCA events.

The most difficult aspect of operation (in addition to restricted
visibility and backing up) is the clutch: my wife calls it the Thighmaster.
 I havent measured, but Id guess its about 60-80 pounds to activate.  In
comparison, the clutch on our early 308 GTB is a featherweight.  Honestly,
Ive gone straight from the Countach to the 308, and the difference is
greater than from the 308 to any modern car.  The throttle travel is long
as well.  You just keep pushing, and the engine just builds power.  In
fact, the overwhelming sensation when driving is that you keep holding the
car back.  It feels the same at 50 as it does at 100, and it gets smoother
with speed.  The question everyone asks is how fast: well, under controlled
conditions during testing, I tickled 140, but without knowing the tire and
car history, I wouldnt do much more.  The car had plenty left.  During
racing, the tight PCA courses allow maybe 7000 rpm in third gear (~110
mph), but the car just wants more.  The only other car that kind-of feels
the same at speed is the 928.  The car just seems to feel smaller the
faster you go.  In terms of driving position and ergonomics, the Countach
is closer to the 308 than any other car Ive owned (but not that close).

About visibility: you only have to look at the car to realize its going to
be a joke.  But looks are deceiving.  Visibility is excellent to the front,
adequate to the sides, and poor but not blind to the rear.  The wing DOES
NOT block the rear view.  The worst vis is the rear quarters, and having a
passenger glance out the right-side is mandatory for driving in heavy
traffic.  It doesnt help that many, many drivers like to catch up and hug
behind the car in order to inspect it.  Most of these folks hide in the
blind spots.  Two tiny, concave mirrors on the outside corners of the side
mirrors have done wonders to at least indicate the presence of obstacles in
the blind spots.

While registering the car at the DMV (20 minutes after it rolled off the
trailer), I was mobbed with whats proven to be a universal occurrence
every time I take the car out: a huge, passionate crowd gathered to inspect
the car and contents.  In the ensuing months, Ive been tailed, flagged,
pulled over, followed, honked at, had at least a half-a-dozen offers of
sexual enticement (most from women) in exchange for rides, had several
police agencies stop me for inspection (no tickets), and have seen at least
two people lose their glasses onto the pavement as the spun their heads in
a double-take as the car drove past.  Im sure cars such as these are more
common on the coasts, but here in New Mexico, this is pretty  unique.  For
the record, Ive owned and driven a variety of world-class sports cars
(including our current Ferrari 308 GTB), and NOTHING comes close to
attracting the jaw-dropping attention of the Lambo.

One problem weve had is that you cant leave the car alone.  The body is 1
mm thick aluminum and is very fragile.  The car came with a few mild
indentations (not really dents) which the previous owner said were a result
of over-eager fans leaning against the car.  This, plus the attention the
car attracts, adds up to possible trouble.  This makes shopping (yes, weve
gone shopping in the car) and eating out a bit tricky.  There are two
solutions weve come up with: 1) valet were possible, and 2) drop the car
off at new car dealers.  This second method works like a charm.  Weve
taken the Countach to Albuquerque several times, and lately Ive been
dropping by the Lexus or Porsche dealers.  I know the managers at both
sites, and theyve been very accomodating in allowing us to park the Lambo
at the dealer.  In return, Ive been given a variety of loaner cars for the
day in which to shop/eat.  This is a win/win since the dealers (who I
trust) get an instant attraction, and I get local transport and someone
wholl provide security while were running errands.  The fragility of the
body makes engine work a bit tricky.  Accepted procedure is to remove the
rear trunk lid and wing, and you stand or kneel in the trunk to service the
engine.

Theres a lot of vicarious joy in watching others see and inspect the car
for the first time.  The most amazing fan was a 9-year-old boy who had his
mother stop while we were putting new P-Zeros on the car in Santa Fe (Ive
removed and stored the valuable original P7s for some future
owner/collector).  This kid knew everything about the car down to subtle
details.  Ive no idea were he learned this stuff, but he spent a full 90
minutes.  We made his day when we found a camera and took a full roll of
pictures with him in the drivers seat.  Usually, we dont allow folks to
sit in the car in order to preserve the interior trim.  The wide leather
side bolster is especially vulnerable to wear and tear as you slide into
the seats.  The leather is a much better quality than the Ferraris, as the
whole hide is dyed and is softer and finer-grained than the cheap Connoley
stuff.  

I could go on, but maybe Ill wrap up with a simple observation.  Beneath
the sci-fi looks and bad-boy image of this car sits a completely different
machine.  It is tractable, reliable, and supremely confident though the car
needs skill to bring out its best qualities.  The racing car feel never
really disappears, though most of the intimidation eventually wanes.  The
Countach feels very protective with an ahead-of-its time combination of
balance and poise.  Compared to Ferraris of the same era, the car is stable
and predictable with none of the skitishness and light feeling you get
under hard cornering.  Whatever else the automotive world might bring, the
Countach still ranks as one of the most outlandish and provocative driving
experiences the enthusiast could want.
