	You can keep driving it without worry of something else
	breaking. You'll just get stranded somewhere. When it
	happened to me, I was just 1 block from my apartment.
	I managed to get an addiditonal 5000 miles from
	the time I noticed the slop (I noticed it right
	away, too) to when the clutch gave out
	completely.

	You have some choices here. You can get the factory
	replacement clutch, you can get the turbo clutch, or
	you can get the Cup Car clutch. The factory clutch is
	rubber centered, the turbo clutch is a multi-spring device
	and the Cup car clutch is a single spring doohicky.
	The rubber degrades, the multi spring shoots broken springs
	all over the place, and the single spring...I don't know
	what it does because I've never heard of anyone breaking
	one. If you plan on tracking the car or racing it, I'd go
	with the Cup car clutch. For normal, easy street driving,
	the factory job is ok.
