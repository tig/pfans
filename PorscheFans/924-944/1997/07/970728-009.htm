Hi, I have a strange problem with my '87 944-S that has been occurring
within the last few weeks as I am driving along, at random times the 
heat will come on for a short period all by itself, and then turn itself 
back off after about 5 minutes (or less sometimes).

It happens with the Temp knob turned completely cold, down to the little
blue dot.  I haven't actually used the heat on purpose since winter.
The fan is usually turned off when it happens, but the heat comes out 
much faster than the cool air flow normally is (or so it seems). 

Does anyone have some suggestions as to what I should check, or how to
prevent this from happening??  It is most uncomfortable to have heat on when
the temp's outside are already in the 90's.

Thanks in advance for your help.
