HI P-fans,

I have recently purchased a 92 968 coupe, it has the standard 16"
wheels, I am interested in installing 17" wheels on the car. Will the
BORBET C2T 17" fit (as advertised by Tire Rack in magazines like Car and
Driver). I know I need 17"*7.5 in the front and 17"*9 in the back, but I
read somewhere that the backspacing should be 150.3 mm front and 166.3
mm back and offset 55 mm f and 52 mm back. What is backspacing and
offset, is it the same for the 968 as the 911 C2 Turbo ( hence the name
of the BORBET wheel). Has any one tried them long term and would you
recommend buying them as opposed to the factory 17" that are $1,000's
more.

I have just had my engine oil changed, Porsche recommends 5W30 but my
P-specialist put in 10W40 synthetic, I live in Montreal Canada, will it
withstand -20 C in winter?

Thanks for the info P-friends and good summer.

Ala
