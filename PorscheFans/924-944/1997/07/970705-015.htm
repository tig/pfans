The '91 944 S2 was the first S2 with airbags as *standard*.
(At least in germany)
Check the VIN for the modelyear. Mine reads like:
WPOZZZ94ZMN4......
         ^- this is a 1991 model (L=1990, ...)
   ^^^- just a filler on a german VIN (ZZZ),
      - US cars may have some other letters/digits(?) here

(Model year 1991 does not mean that a car has been built
in 1991. Porsche's model years mostly start in summer/autumn
of the year before)

Cars you buy from a dealer ALWAYS have clean(ed) engines
and look like new. (The tires look like new, the car smells
new, the ash tray is perfectly clean, ... - got me?)

>was etched on the inside of the hood, fenders,and trunk.
>Again the dealer had no answer.  Another item I saw was
>a service sticker, but it was not in english,  It had some

Tell me the words and i can translate them for you.

The german S2 has 211hp while the US spec car has 208bhp.
(But i've been told that 211hp == 208bhp - so this seems
to make no difference)

German 944s have other direction indicators on the front fender:
The german is *behind* the front wheels and measures about 3*6 cm.
US 944s have their direction indicators *before* the front wheels
and are much longer ~15cm(?) (Saw them only on pictures)

>I'm a first time porsche buyer,  so any advice I can get
>would be great.  Send any suggestions, helpful hints to beastie@put.com

Suggestion 1: listen to the tech-wizards on this list.
    "      2: get the 944 FAQ and read it.


Good luck,
  Guenter
2.91 944 S2, azuritblau
