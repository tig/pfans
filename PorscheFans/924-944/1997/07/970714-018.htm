We had an auto-x yesterday at the PNE lot in Vancouver, B.C.  Lots of fun.
A good open course with flowing corners, not too fast, but flowing.

I did the best I have done in a long time with that test pipe in.  My first
run, I had so much more low end torque that I spun the car while babying
the throttle!  Next runs went faster and faster, then I reached my max.

Paul went out first run and set what was to be close to his fastest time
of the day, max from run 1, pretty damn good.

Wes absolutely flew.  He was really, really fast, almost vying for FTD.

Kerry Brown has been making some huge improvement in his driving and
is getting faster and faster each event, closing the gap.  He's taking
the right way to learn, he's not changing anything, not adding any power,
just making the most of what he has before he changes anything, smart move.

Our times:
Driver		Car		Tire			Time
Wes		1991 944 S2	BFG R1			56.0
Richard	1990 Corvette	BFG R1			57.0
Harry		1989 911C	BFG R1			58.2
Paul		1989 944T	Potenza S-02		58.8
Farzaan	1989 944T	Dunlop SP8000		59.4
Patrick Ma	1996 911T	Potenza S-02		59.8 (only did one or two runs)
Patrick	1989 944T	Yokohama RS-II	60.5
Kerry		1987 944S	Dunlop I think	64.0 (I think)

As you can see, Wes was in a league of his own.

Next week is a Regional at Whistler, it's do or die time for me.  Either
I do well and keep my hopes alive, or I do crappy and screw the whole
year.  Of course, I'm still on street tires this year, leaving the stickies
for next year.

Farzaan.
