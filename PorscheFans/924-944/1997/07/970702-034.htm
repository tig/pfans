Hi everyone,
	I'll try to give you all the readers digest version of what happened,
and to see if this has happened to anyone else:

	Coming home down a 2 mile straight split highway paved section of road
where visibility is great and usually little if any traffic, I did what
most of you would do, revved up my '86 951 through the gears.  At the
stop, I noticed a new, sweet smell.  Stupid me, thought a dumpster was
near or something.  Then a guy in a truck said I was losing coolant. 
Heat guage up to the third mark and rising, I coasted in the drive and
shut 'er off.  Opened the hood.  Got my sinuses cleaned by boiling
coolant steam.  

	Right below the rear of the intake manifold, a 1" diameter hose came
off a metal fitting.  (Two or three other very small 1/8" hoses plug
into the same box that this 1" hose fit into.  What is this??)  I assume
this brings coolant to the manifold and is for vacuum metering.  Then
again learning the hard way, I filled the expansion tank, not knowing
that a bleeder fitting even existed.  That explains why she heated up
again.  I didn't know that at the time however, and saw $$ dancing
through my head.

Everything's back to normal now except my sinuses.  

	Hope you all get a good laugh from this and hopefully maybe you'll
benefit from this experience if it happens to you.
