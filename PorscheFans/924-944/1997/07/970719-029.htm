Guenter:

I replaced my Dunlop D40s with Pirelli P7000 supersports a few months ago (92
968 coupe).  The tires are the same sizes as yours.  My wife's 968 cab has
P700z tires, but in 17" sizes (225/50 front, 255/45(?) rear), which makes
comparing a little difficult.

I bought the P7000s because Tire Rack said that they were the quietest and
best-riding Z rated tires available, and the all-season compounding was an
additional plus.  I drive my 968 every day, so liveability is important to
me.  I autocrossed them once when brand new, and they did not feel very
sticky, but for twisty road handling I have been very happy with them, and I
pushed them pretty hard on a recent driving trip.

My wife's 968 cab, with the 17" P700z tires, sticks significantly better than
mine does in the corners.  It is also very quiet, but the ride is inferior to
mine, either because of the design or the lower profile.  I would be very
happy with either tire, and both are infinitely superior to the D40s.  I
suspect the P700z is a more single-purpose tire than the P7000, but there is
not a great deal of difference.

Hope this helps.
