The list had unsubscribed everyone when I originally sent this out.  Sorry
about the late post, I've been in Fort Worth Tx. for the past week.




        I raise the turbo up to the heavens and let out a
might roar.  The mighty Porsche gods have not denied me
my prize.  I collapse on the ground weeping, tears of joy
flow.


Then I get up and run to the little boys room.  As usual
I've put the Porsche above all else.  It is a struggle,
will I be able to get this last bolt before I wet my
pants?  Hold it, hold it....

Done.


The turbo is finally out.  My days of struggle are half
over.  I asses the situation:

I have one oily turbo.
I have dozens of little baggies.
I have one messy engine.
and two bolts that aren't in little baggies. :(


I take the turbo to the girlfriend's neighbor.  He looks
at it and says "I tell you you've wasted your time,  it
isn't your turbo that's broken."  I grab the turbo from
him and hit in the face.  I hear his curses as I run
away, holding my prize.

I don't care, I will have an oil free intake.  No longer
will I have to restrain from full throttle at the track.
I will blow by everyone, laughing, hahahaha.
