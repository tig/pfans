Paul and mine are 89 944T which are not technically called "S" models,
but have all of the "S" parts on them from the factory.

It is this ugly brown cylinder under the intake manifold, but before doing
that, get the right chips from John Milledge or anyone else that uses
that system.

The car, based on exhaust temp, etc moves the boost around a few psi, so
during our runs, we were able to see how much 1psi boost change made
a difference in the HP and TQ.  For comparison runs, we would keep
doing the run until the boost came up to the same level (usually took
a few minutes to let the coolant temp get past the first mark on the gauge).

>to the rear wheels.

I actually want 300hp at the wheels now :)  So far, I can get up to 265hp
at the wheels using APE chips and the drilled valve, but I'm going to
continue developing the setup I have until I run out of fuel.  As my
car stands right now, it has 258hp at the wheels.  I'm hoping the test
pipe adds another 5-10hp and opens the torque curve up a bit.  Once that
goes on, I'm going to try a conical K&N.  If those two items don't give
it, I'll go for the MAF.  I'm sure that by the time I reach my goal, I'll
want more, that's when the really cool stuff will start like the K27, etc.

>5.  What is the CBV?

Compressor Bypass Valve.  A more efficient one gives no additional HP
or TQ, but brings the boost in MUCH faster after letting off.

>87' 951 w/APE 2.7 and wanting more

Unfortunately, to get more from a non-"S" turbo will require some turbo
upgrading or some serious mapping changes.  Look at Darren's car's results
with the APE setup.  Spike city.
