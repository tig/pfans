Richard,

If the "series" you are talking about is the turbocharger type (there are 3),
then I believe the main difference was the addition of ring seals to the
turbo-to-manifold and turbo-to-exhaust joints.  I heard somewhere that the
impeller blades and housing are a little smaller on type 2 and 3 turbos, but
I can't see any obvious difference.  Type 1 has no ring seals, type 2 has the
ring seal on the exhaust manifold joint and type 3 has a ring seal on both
the manifold and exhaust joints.  As far as the intake housing and compressor
blades, I don't know of any differences.  The factory manual says the different
turbo types are not interchangable, but my 1980 model has the type 3 on it now.
It should have been manufactured with type 1, but the previous owner may have
had the exhaust manifold replaced.  Mine has an additional "05" added to the
standard part number.  I've had a type 2 on the bench next to the type 3 on my
car now, and they looked identical except for the rings seals.

IMHO, you can swap them at will as long as you use ring seals where the 
exhaust housing can accept them.

        What's up with the above tag I received with my message receipt?  
        Did all of you get my message about how I goofed on weighing the 
        Borbet's, or did only 6 of you really get it?  I wonder if 1,500 
        members actually cancelled their subscriptions last week.
                Well, for the six of us still on PorscheFans, it sure is 
        kind of quiet and lonely in here... So, any of you want to argue 
        about which car is better:  944S2 or 951?
        
        
        Ben
