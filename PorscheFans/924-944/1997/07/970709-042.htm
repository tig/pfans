You didn't think I'd leave you hanging like that, now did you?

Here are some raw numbers:

                  RW-HP          RW-Torque          FW-HP         FW-Torque
Farzaan         257 @ 5500      270 @ 4250           293             308
Paul            249 @ 5750      287 @ 4250           284             327
Tim             237 @ 5500      260 @ 4500           270             296
Darren          208 @ 5750      262 @ 3500           237             299
Stock "S"       216 @ 5750      228 @ 3750           246             259
Stock "S" boost w/
APE v2.7        231 @ 6000      220 @ 5250           263             251

Can you tell which one has the non-"S" turbo in it (hint:look at the max
torque RPM).

It's hard to convert from wheel to flywheel HP.  I'll tell you what I
did and if anyone knows of a better way, let me know.  We ran Paul's car
with the full car completely back to stock.  I took the claimed flywheel
torque and divided it by the rear wheel HP and Torque.  I came up with
1.14 for the HP and 1.12 for the Torque.  I used 1.14 as it seemed more
correct as HP seems to be very consistent and torque is off a bit at
times (+-5 lb-ft).

As you can see from above, these cars have some smokin' engines.  The 911
guys would be proud to see these numbers.  Most people brag about having
close to 300lb-ft of torque at the flywheel, Paul will be approaching that
at the WHEELS!

Paul's incredibly high torque figures are a bit misleading though.  On
his run, the boost gauge (which I videorecorded) ran up to 16.2psi,
whereas my car ran only up to 14psi.  His car's KLR immediately got
pissed off and told the DME to pull back the timing, richen the mixture
and the c-valve to dial back the boost.  The boost drops dramatically, then
the KLR says, OK, it's feeling better in that cylinder, let's bring the
timing back up, clean up the mixture a bit and allow some boost to
be dialed back (is this how it goes Larry?), then you see the boost
start to rise a pound or two back up.  This creates a wicked rise in
torque when you get the 16.2psi, but then the torque *and* HP curves
go downhill fast as the KLR reduces boost, then as it increases it
again, you see the torque *and* HP curves come back up.  My drilled


cycling valve with the turbo cup units have SMOOTH
curves like the factory chips, just much higher HP and Torque.

To my susprise, my torque band is broader and almost as high as Paul's.
Paul's APE setup falls flat on its face at 4500rpm and starts to
recover at 5500rpm.  Mine doesn't dip at all in that area, just
pulls nice and clean.

The torque of the town was Darren's 87 944T with APE 2.2.  That car
can pull a tree out of the ground, but only in a very, very narrow
power band.  From 3000-4250, the car holds the high torque figure,
after that, it's downhill city.  My car in comparison holds a
high torque peak from 3500rpm to almost 5500rpm without a major drop
off before or after that.  Once again, as in all of the APE cars we
tested, it has that damn dip in the power band.  Many people had
complained to me about the flat spots, well, they are now here
in front of my face as proof.  All of the APE cars have some odd
dips, etc.  I thought it might be the car, but when the computers were
swapped, those same cars had smooth torque cuves again.  It's all related
to how high the boost is run.  When we ran Paul's car with the stock
boost bolt, the KLR didn't have to get into the middle of things
and the torque and HP curves are nice and smooth, but crank the boost
and it gets all cranky and starts to create lumps in the curves.

Tim's car with the older APE chips (ver 2.5) has a really bad dip
in the power right before the car comes on full song.  His boost was
pretty low, so he may tweek the banjo bolt for the next time, and 
probably introduce yet another dip in the powerband when the KLR
decides the party's over.

A few more tidbits.  The boost presssure run is very important for
torque figures.  I turned my boost down by 1psi to see what would
happen, the car produced the same HP, but lost 10lb-ft of torque!
Same with Paul's run, from 16.0 to 15.0 saw him lose 10lb-ft of
torque, or gain it if you look the other way (right Torquemaster-Paul!)

So, what's the hot setup?  Probably the John Milledge setup because
I can see now why he would continue to use the drilled cycling valve.
But, what to do if you already have APE chips?  Not to worry, the
hot setup of the day was my car with the drilled cycling valve and
Paul's APE v2.7 chips.  This produced some awesome numbers of:

                  RW-HP          RW-Torque          FW-HP         FW-Torque
Farzaan         264 @ 5500      271 @ 4500           301             309

As you can see, that makes one killer car, but the story cannot be
told by the numbers only.  When you get to see the dyno charts, you
will notice that the torque band is wide, rising and fat.  Which
means, that awesome surge when you floor it, and the continous pull of the 
engine that I like so much.

Powerhaus had said that a stock "S" model puts 200hp to the rear wheels.
I think they are high.  I think they gave that figure just to make their
products seem better or give more power, *or* maybe they quoted the
HP level of a non-"S" model.  If you look at Darren's figures, without
the APE stuff, he'd likely be in the high 180's low 190's range in HP
at the wheels, so who knows.

Let's go back to when I bought my car, do you remember what my goal was
about power?  I wanted 268hp to the rear wheels because Powerhaus
and Windward said I needed K27, MAF, etc, etc, to get there.  Well, look
up at the numbers, I'll be there in a week or two with the simple
mods I'm doing.  Imagine if I'd put all that money into the car without
listening to you guys and then ran on the dyno and saw 268, I would
have been happy, but little would I have known that the stock package
can produce the same damn numbers with a few tweeks!  I'm only running
14psi, not even 1 bar!!!  If I turn the boost up a pound or two and
get the cat test-pipe and the CBV, the car should haul!

Please keep this info in the hands of only list members if possible.
I don't want to see my results show up in some magazine without my
permission.  This cost me a small fortune and any reduction I can
get on it is a good thing.  Minnam has promised a major refund if I
can get them in a magazine, so please don't ruin that opportunity for
me by posting this email in newsgroups or on your web site.  If it does
leak out and become common knowledge, I'll have to think twice before
making something like this open to the 944 list.

Once the magazine situation is sorted out, I will create a web site or
at least an FTP site for the impatient ones with all of the details.
The above numbers only tell 10% of the story, the dyno graphs tell
the other 90%.  Let's just say Paul's torque peak looks damn good
up there, but I'll take him on any day from a roll or from 5000rpm on
up!

If you have individual questions, fire away.  We tested O2 sensors
too.

I'm already booked on the dyno for next week for a test of the test pipe
and hopefully the B&B exhaust by then.  These Germans that built these
cars deserve a pat on the back.  We ran a heat soak test to see if the
IC was heating up enough to cause false numbers (Jim reminded me to 
check this).  An MX-6 Turbo in the day before required 20 mins between
runs to cool down enough for consistent results.  What about the Porsche?
My car's fastest run came right after it's first run, like RIGHT after,
no cool down, nothing.  We ran Paul's car for 6 runs back to back with
a control at the end, no change in the control, only decimal changes.
I don't know how much you understand about this stuff, but to have that
little change in heat in the IC and engine is amazing

Farzaan - 300hp and 300lb-ft of torque & 14.0 @ 103.5mph in the 1/4.
Don't believe me?  I have the dyno sheets and the timeslips to prove it!
