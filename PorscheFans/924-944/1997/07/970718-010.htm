i have had great success with covering the old dash with coverlays.  it is a
piece of plastic that is molded to the shape of the dash and is grained to
look like the original surface.  i know it is not the best solution, but for
$85?!!  you really can not lose.  you just glue it over the old dash.  great
fit.   sorry, i have to draw comparisons to my other german cars, but yes i
have placed these on some old bimmers and an old benz.  very happy with the
results.  i am not about to spend $500+ on a ten year old car that is not a
collector.  i think it also looks a lot better than those cloth covers that
quite a few retailers sell.  your friends will really not notice.  hey, if
you really want to get extreme, just think of those cracks in the dash as
"lightening your car"

YMMV
