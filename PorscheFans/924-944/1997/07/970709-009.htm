     Has anyone had experience with both the CoolCarbons and the 
     PerformanceFriction pads? Its time to replace my CoolCarbons and I'm 
     trying to decide between trying to find the CC pads again or switching 
     to PF pads. I love the CCs, except for the horrible amounts of dust.  
     It wipes right off (which I try to do after each drive) unless the 
     dust gets wet. Then it gets very difficult to remove the dust without 
     using anything too caustic for my wheels. (Windex is a nice 
     wheel-friendly cleaner that works pretty well until the dust gets 
     really thick and has been wet BTW).  
     
     Anyway, will braking force increase or decrease by going to the PF 
     from the CC? Do the PF pads produce less dust or is it about the same? 
     How about braking when cold? This is certainly a strong point of the 
     CCs, are the PFs as good?
     
     Any input would be appreciated.
