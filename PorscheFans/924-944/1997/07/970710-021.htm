Ben,
    I had Dynamic European Technologies rebuild an A-arm for $150, and was 
satisfied with the work. You really shouldn't need a grease fitting. They are 
located in Texas, the phone number should be in the FAQ. I personally believe 
that $150 is still too much, but until we have a suitable source for 
replacement parts, I guess we are stuck with that price.
Good Luck!
Ezra
