Hi PorscheFans,

I have decided to sell my 1987 944 Turbo.  Just got married - time to =
build a house (yeah...I know...I WAS going to keep it).  The car is =
Guards Red with black leather interior.  The car has just over 55K =
miles, new motor mounts, new Dunlop D40M2 tires, Weltmeister chip (0.9 =
bar boost), new Blaupunkt CD Player, new brake master cylinder, =
Evolution 4 car cover, etc.  All maintainence done while I have owned =
the car has been done by the Porsche dealer in Atlanta or myself, =
including a recent timing belt replacement/re-tensioning.  The car is in =
excellent condition.  The price is $9500.  The car is located in Warner =
Robins, GA.

BTW, the car was re-built as a salvaged car (with 45K miles), so it is =
re-titled.  I have owned/driven the car since November 1995.  My father, =
brother and I fixed the car ( my dad has been fixing salvaged cars for =
ten years ).  The car had no frame damage at all.  It was hit on the =
left front.  The only body parts replaced were the left front =
fender(used), front bumper cover(used), left fog and signal lights =
(used), header panel (new), and left headlight cover (new).  The =
intecooler, radiator, and even the coolant tank(miraculously) were not =
damaged.  The air bags did not deploy.  The car's alignment was checked =
after we finished the repairs and it was just fine. The car's chassis =
integrity has been checked out by the Atlanta Porsche dealer and the =
car's chassis is solid.

I wanted to mention this because most people are very wary of buying =
re-titled cars or cars that have been in a collision.  This car is in =
excellent shape.  I woundn't have bought it if it wasn't.  But I =
understand that some people want a perfect car with no collision =
history.

I have been driving the car for the past year and a half and have =
enjoyed it thoughly.  It's just time to sell it.  E-mail me for more =
info if you are interested.

Thanx,

J. Dean Roberson
