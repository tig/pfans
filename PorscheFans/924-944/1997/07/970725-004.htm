I just had a defective rebuilt water pump (Tweeks, 16,000 miles) replaced. 
Something to note at replacement time.  Factory rebuilds are available at
nearly the same price.  I would recommend a new factory unit if you want
to insure you will not be doing this 8 hour job prematurely like I was
forced to do. 

My question is this.  Should the balance shaft belt whine audibly after
being tensioned with the 9201 gauge?  The shop (non dealer, but the owner
is the Cascade Region PCA head) insists this whine is normal when the belt
is at the correct tension, but I can't believe it.  It was inaudible
before I brought the car in.  The whine is loud enough to be heard inside
the car.  The timing belt is quiet.

Perhaps the gauge was dropped, not calibrated properly, or the mechanic 
is using the wrong specification.

Also, would folks be willing to be part of a mini-survey and reply to me
privately (unless the list is interested) and tell me if you have whiney
belts. 

I would really like to come back to the shop with the results of this 
survey, and the opinions of the shop owners on this list.

Thanks in advance..

 -Gregor.  89 944 2.7.  Fresh water pump, belts and rollers.
