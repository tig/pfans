For everyone who was unsubscribed, I posted this last Sunday I think, to
a total of 25 people.  Since I had requests for the fix for this problem
whenever I had it fixed I am re-posting.

Dear Collective:

        If you will recall, I was having a problem with the engine
shutting
down at full throttle, and here is what I did to solve the problem.

1) Replaced Throttle Position Sensor - no effect
2) Replaced DME Control Unit and Knock Regulator Control Unit - no
   effect
3) Cleaned engine - no effect (pleasure is irrelevant)
4) Removed air intake, air filter, vacuum lines
5) Cleaned electrical connections to air flow sensor 
6) Tightened upper radiator hose clamp because mechanic, who told me
   computers were bad who told me TPS was bad who told me radiator was
bad,
   who did radiator F&F did not tighten hose clamp.  Mechanic will be
   assimilated.  There is a shortage of waste recycler drones, assign
new
   drone to waste detail.  Drone not to be allowed to repair anything.
7) Re-assembled air intake system
8) Started car
9) Car smoked 3 minutes, engine cleaning fluid burning off exhaust
   pipes.
10) Engine at operating temperature
11) Car exceeded 1.8 bar boost and speed limit 3 times within 10
    minutes, no engine roughness noted, no engine power loss.

        I'll try an extended run tomorrow, but so far the car is running
better
than it has since January when purchased.  If it holds up tomorrow I
will be happy, though poorer (money is relevant).  So, if your car is
running rough at full throttle, clean the air flow sensor connector and
cable connector first.  Check the vacuum lines!
You might just save yourself a lot of money.

>>>Since Sunday the car continues to run wonderfully.  
This is my first experience with a fully functional 951, 
and I have to wonder, for the street, why would anyone 
want to modify or change her?  I've read a lot here about
lightening this and changing that, and coming from a cycling
background (carbon vs aluminum vs titanium & Campy vs Shimano)
I know that you can spend a LOT and end up with nothing, 
mainly because YOU are not good enough.
Tell y'all what (you 250 pound men).  I weigh 145.  Save all
the money you are spending on all those carbon-fiber parts,
stripping the A/C, changing chips etc, and let me drive your cars
(before you ruin them).
You will save 100 ponds off the top, and I won't charge you near
as much as that blown engine and divorce will cost you!  Give you
$2500 for the car once you blow it to 300 hp H*** Mr. Farzann
(spelling?).
