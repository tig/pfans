I consider myself a shade tree mechanic (learned most of what I know
rebuilding EVERYTHING on an MGB and Sprite).  Now the 944 engine most
certainly is orders of magnitude more advanced than these dinosaurs,
however, I did a successful rebuild of mine back in 1989 and it now has
about 100K on it since with not a single problem other than front crank
seal is leaking a little now.  True, it was not cheap at $4,500 for parts
and machine work but I feel I got my money's worth and the satisfaction of
doing it myself.  Your motor may actually cost less if you don't need new
pistons (i.e. boring oversize) and the fancy boring technique (I hear that
some outboard engine rebuilder's can do them now).  These two items cost
about $1,000 alone.  I had a Porsche shop re-do the head.  If you've
rebuilt a few engines before, you can do this one.  Just take your time (I
had a spare car); I think I spent about 3 months doing mine on weekends. 
You will need to buy some of that anerobic sealant stuff for the main
bearing 'girdle' to block seal (and oil pump to block).  The Haynes manual
procedure works O.K. for getting the engine out.  One of those cherry
picker-type lifts works great (you lower the engine and remove from under
the car).  Good luck.  Feel free to e-mail with any questions.
