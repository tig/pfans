Yeah, right.

The factory raced 300+ HP 944 Turbo Cup cars with very impressive
reliability. The late 951S cars are evidence of their track experience,
although detuned for street use. Yes, the motors are more highly stressed
at greater than 100hp/liter, but they were engineered that way based on a
variety of considerations.

When was the Chevy 350 designed? And you think 1977 engineering is old!

You're correct in stating that automotive technology continues to improve;
eventually the 944 will be an antique. Porsche engineering is significantly
ahead of the curve, though -- far more so than most mainstream GM products
-- and the 944 is still very much a modern car.
