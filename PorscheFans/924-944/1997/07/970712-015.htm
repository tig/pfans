Many people had asked me to find out what the car runs A/F mixture
wise.  So, I hooked up my trusty K&N A/F mixture meter and went for
an afternoon of WOT fun.

Remember, we did this on my car, so Cup Computers, 1 bar boost, O2
disconnected.  At part throttle, the car runs at 13:1.  It actually
holds it pretty steady which is unusual for an O2 sensor, they normally
bounce around.

I was expecting to see an oscillation that people feel as the lurching
the car does under part throttle (I thought it was the O2 sensor's
fault), but I guess it is actually the factory mapping that causes
that.

Under WOT in 3rd and 4th gear (it's always fun doing WOT in 4th at
high RPM!), the car runs at 12:1 which is a bit rich.  You want around
12.5:1 so it's close and safe for street drivers.  

Next job is to find a way to see what's happening to timing
at WOT.  I guess there must be a way to see it on the dyno?

Farzaan.
