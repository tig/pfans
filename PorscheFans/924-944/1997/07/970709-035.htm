I can't help, but I can join in your request for help. I replaced my
battery about 1 month ago. My 87 951 guage has read at or below 12v for
quite awhile (before replacing the battery). Yesterday, while at a drive
through bank, the starter was verrry slow, and the guage read no more than
10v on the way home. Turning the a/c off raised it to about 11v. I'm
convinced it is slowly draining the battery and probably caused the failure
of my old battery.

My mechanic says 3.6 hours to r/r the alternator. If lucky, it is the
voltage regulator which can be purchased separately and comes with a new
set of brushes for the alternator (cost about $65). If not lucky, rebuilt
alternator is about $300.

Any other ideas would be appreciated.

Mike
