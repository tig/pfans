Howdy,

I'm surprised there hasn't been any talk about the drag races!  Maybe
everyone skipped it because they didn't want to read about the abuse :)

I ended up purchasing the cat-bypass pipes from a company called German
Parts and Restoration.  The unit is a Bursch unit.  Before laying down
the big $$$ for the stainless steel versions from B&B, I thought it
would be smarter to try it out with the cheaper parts (US$189 VS. US$499).

This Saturday is Dyno Day, finally.  I have given up waiting for them
to get a good fan, so I'm renting a huge commercial unit, it'll probably
produce more HP than my car :)  This is what we have put together for
the day so far:

1. First run will be Paul's car with the autothority chips in there (latest
   version 2.7).
2. Next car up will be mine run exactly as it it right now with pump gas.
3. While my car is being put up on the rollers, I will change Paul's chips
   back to stock and replace the boost bolt back to stock.
4. Once my car's baseline is taken, I will change the air filter to a K&N
   and re-run two runs to see if it made a difference.
5. After my car is off, Paul's will go back on with the factory boost
   chips and bolt.  Once that is completed, I will swap in the early 
   Autothority units.
6. I am trying to get Lou to bring down his 89 Turbo to test the Weltmeister
   units, but I think he is out of town (he films for Outer Limits).

I was going to put Paul's computers in my car to see how the Autothority
chips run with the drilled cycling valve in comparison to the boost bolt,
but that wouldn't be fair to Autothority since they do not sell their
parts in that configuration.

7. Weissach Performance is bringing down their most heavily modified 930
   turbo to test out, and if their parts manager allows it, they are going
   to allow me to test a SS B&B cat-back exhaust on the car.  These are the
   big muffler versions, not the carbon fibre loud ones.
8. Darren Foo is bringing his 87 Turbo down and we will stick that on the
   dyno to see how fast a chipped non-"S" model is.

I have five hours booked, so hopefully that will be enough.  Anything else
anyone can think of?  This is costing me a lot of money so I want to make
sure that this gives the most value per dollar to myself and the list.  We
could also see if the response is different with the O2 sensor disconnected
and re-connected with the stock and APE chips.

Once we have the baseline set, any future mods will be easy to test with
the correction factors built into the software.

The test pipe was US$189 from GPR.  Their number is 1-800-321-5432 or 
805-549-8525.  I don't usually advertise for someone, but they were so
nice and kind on the phone, I had to express my delight in ordering from
them.  In comparison, another shop I called said my 89 944 Turbo was a
gray market car and the test pipes they had would not fit a gray market
car!  

Farzaan.
