Howdy,

First off, special thanks to Paul Buchmann, Darren Foo, Timothy Stark,
and Minnam Racing for their assistance in getting dyno day done.  Without
their help (and their cars or facilities), this would have never happened.

Minnam Racing was excellent to deal with, just fantastic.  I came with
a list of the mods I wanted to try and on which car and at which time,
and they did all that I wanted like clockwork.  I highly recommend them
(604)821-1960 ask for Andrew.

Because this dyno day is being used in an article for a large magazine,
I cannot give away all of the juicy details (as soon as the magazine
gives me back confirmation in a day or two, I will be able to give it
all away, I just don't want to blow it before they make their decision;
if I get the dyno day in a mag, Minnam is going to give me a big break
on the HUGE bill that we incurred), but I sure can give some brash,
harcore comments backed with dyno proof.

The following is REAL, these are not lies, I have the dyno numbers to
back what I say, so you K&N lovers can put that flame thrower down
right now!

1. Get rid of that K&N, all it does it allow fine dirt into your engine!
   It doesn't do anything for power.  Next time at the dyno, I'll be
   testing Windward's bolt on cone K&N and we'll see if that can redeem
   K&N.  Not a single HP, not a single lb-ft of Torque for the darn C$50
   filter!
2. If you want raw high numbers, use the boost bolt, if you want smooth
   power without dips and valleys, but without the super high numbers,
   use a drilled cycling valve.
3. For the smoothest power, the factory knows best with the turbo cup
   computers making the aftermarket chips look like some drunk programmed
   them.
4. Autothority's claims for HP and Torque are real, very real, almost
   conservative!
5. Our Weltmeister friend did not show and our B&B exhaust did not come
   in, so those will be another dyno day.
6. Next week we are testing the cat pipe.

Farzaan.
