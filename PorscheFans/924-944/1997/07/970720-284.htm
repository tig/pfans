The typical scenario is the system runs low on refrigerant, and the low 
pressure switch opens to protect the compressor, since the oil that is 
in the system along with the refrigerant will not circulate.

The owner unwittingly bridged the low pressure switch to force the 
compressor to run again.  There may be minimal cooling available, but the 
compressor is at risk of being damaged due to lack of lubricant.

Fixing the leak and recharging the system should fix matters.
