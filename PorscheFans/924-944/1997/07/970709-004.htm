Carsten,

Ive done a Starter exchange on my 84'924, Its not that hard. As I recall
working from under the car there's some sort of exhaust shield that needs
to be removed, just a couple of small bolts. You DO have to remover the oil
filter, If you don't you can't get the space needed to remove the starter. 
(Good time for an oil change) There are two really long bolts holding the 
starter in place. With everything removed I didn't have that much trouble
removing them, the top bolt I think was a feel it rather than see it sort
of a job. Last but not least remember to disconnect the cables to the starter.
I did this after it was free, so I could see what I was doing. Just remember
to hold the starter as you take the last bolt out.

BTW Make sure you get the correct replacement. 944 startes look the same but
work in the wrong direction.

Good luck

Richard.
