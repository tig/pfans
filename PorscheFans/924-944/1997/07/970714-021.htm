John -- my 944 just got back from Pat Moyle's shop and here is what he
found:
1. Camshaft belt was at 5.0 and the balance shaft belt was at 2.2. Since
I drove the car 1800 highway miles after having it re-tensioned at
Chris's German Auto in Bellevue, WA, it is probably fair to say that the
belts were tensioned incorrectly. As Dave Cooley once told me, a loose
belt will rattle around and give you other indicators but an
over-tensioned belt will simply break, and we all know what that means.
The clunking noise (that I thought was a bad alternator) was apparently
related to the over-tensioned cam belt or the loose balance shaft belt
since all the rollers and w/pump were ok and the noise is gone with both
belts set to 2.7.

2. Fuel mixture was set completely inaccurately. Pat Moyle informed me
that he had to lean it out by more than 8 to 9 turns. Chris also told me
that my car would not hold the fuel mixture and the DME richened the
mixture every few seconds and he gave me a long list of (expensive)
things that may be bad, preventing an accurate mixture, including a bad
DME, bad temp. sensor, bad AFM, bad O2 sensor etc. Pat Moyle found a
slight loose connection in the head temp. sensor wire and the mixture is
now at 0.6% CO with less than 0.01% variation coming from the O2 sensor
-- better than new car specs. All low end hesitation is gone and I am
getting better than 26 mpg on the highway.

I paid approx. $100 for a belt-retension and fuel mixture reset at
Chris's, so these were the only two items on my work-order.

I don't wish to completely dismiss the reputation of Chris's German Auto
because a lot of list-members recommended it and they cannot all be
wrong. I may have just had the bad luck to get saddled with a new
technician or a bad day. I will reiterate though, that I got the
impression that they had very little time or inclination to fix my old
944, with the stable of shiny new 911s and 993s parked in front. Another
possibility is that Pat Moyle's shop is simply a better equipped place,
in terms of resources, equipment, experience and customer service.
Please take my experience with Chris's German Auto for what it was -- a
one time lemon -- and make your own judgments.
