Hi everyone;

   Just when I thought I was about ready to
finalise a deal on a 1986 944, along comes
this other one just to make my life really
confused. This second car is a 1987 944S and
I really need some expert guidance as to what
I should be thinking. 
  Essentially, other than color and a slight
mileage difference (46000miles for 944 /
58000miles for 944S) the cars are virtually
identical in terms of services
(belts/brakes/pump all done), overall
condition, and options. I know that the S has
the 16 valve engine, but is it a much better
car/better buy? The S is approximately
$6000.00cdn more and will go for about
$16000.00 cdn.
  Any opinions? Is the S worth the extra
money? Is the S better/more fun to drive with
the 16 valve engine? Are the brakes
better/different? I'm looking for a good, fun
car to use as a summer toy/every other day
driver. :-)

Looking for any guidance and opinions
please...

P.S. The cars both have the usual options
such as leather, power door
locks/windows/mirrors, A/C, sunroof, 15"
phone dials, etc.
