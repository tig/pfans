OK I can't resist adding more fuel to the fire.

As I understand it Farzaan has made statements regarding folks who don' make use or fully understand the capabilities of their vehicles. (I belive this was directed at Kincaid). Also as I understand it Farzaan loves to autocross his 951 but does not have a lot of 'real' track time. To me this falls under the "pot calling the kettle black" scenario. High speed driving in parking lots?? I have done it and yes it can be fun but it does not compare to extended track driving. Autocrossing actually reminds me more of drag racing with corners. The real (at least to me) test of engineering and also of 'real world' driver skills is an extended track run. When I used to race a lot the typical sprint event was about 45 minutes. The car and driver had to make the tires, brakes and coolant last and operate efficiently. 
300 hp for 60 seconds? Doesn't sound to difficult. 300hp for 45 minutes, mostly full throttle? More difficult. Being able to use all 300hp correctly for 45 minutes? Very difficult and really fun. Personally (My opinion), this is what Porsches (any flavor) were designed for and what they really excel at.
This is not meant as a flame for anybody. I really enjoy what Farzaan is doing and thank him for the experiments that he shares with us. Too bad he is on the left coast, wouldn't mind meeting him.
