Porsche guru's,

I've been receiving the 924/944 list for only a week or so now.  I've
intended to learn a bit more about these wonderful cars before
determining which to purchase as my first Porsche.  I've come accross a
deal on an '87 924s that seems hard to resist, so I need some advice
from those in the know.  

The 924s is a 944 drive train wrapped in lighter pachage and therefor
faster than the 944?  What are the disadvantages of the 924s (besides
the obvious lack of fender flares and ground effects.  Suspension? 
Brakes?  I'd hate to buy this '87 924s and regret it later.  Like I said
I had intended to gather up a bit more knowledge before plunging in, but
at well under the book value, this one is tempting.  Please advise.

I wouldn't buy one without letting a dealer look it over, but I would
like to know whether the 924s lacks in comparison to the 944.

Please respond via email, and I'll post a response letter.

Thanks
Bill
