First, I'd like to thank everyone again for their input. It has 
been invaluable in getting started in my FIRST Porsche.

I've received a basic clean health report from the shop on my 
88 944T (blk/blk).  

The car has no airbags (stolen?) so the steering wheel was 
replaced with a MOMO and the passenger side cover doesn't cover 
anything.  Other than that, stock except Authority chipped, new 
stainless exhaust/cat and Weltmeister CamberMeister.  79k 
miles.  Very nice but not perfect condition.

I bought it in San Francisco, CA for 8300 cash.  Best as I can 
tell from your input and the shop is that I got a VERY good 
deal.  

Well, enough bubbling over, on to my ??.

The car has 3 sp8000s and 1 something else on it.  All are 
225/50 and I'm experiencing a low speed handling problem.  I'm 
considering getting 245/45s on the back and putting the two 
best 225/50 onto the front.  If that doesn't work, I'll 
consider going to 205/55s on the front.

Any comments on this setup?  Also, can anyone provide any info 
on the TIRERACK mail order shop?  Local quotes for 245/45 range 
from 218-269 while TIRERACK is offering them at 155.  That's a 
pretty big difference.  Note none of the local quotes includes 
mounting and balancing.

Now, balancing.  I can't find anyone who will balance the tires 
on the car.  I called a place that does mostly Porsche, 
Mercedes, Audi and they won't do it.  And I tried a few others 
without success.  Is my interpretation of this list correct 
that many of you recommend, and I imagine obtained, on car 
balancing of the wheel/tire combos?

I'm still only getting like 1 digest out of 4 so direct replies 
would be appreciated.
