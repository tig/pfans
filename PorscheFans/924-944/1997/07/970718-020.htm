But the gas fumes really clear the sinuses...

Seriously, the cause may be caused by a loose or misdirected fuel overflow
drain.  Rain or fuel that splashes when filling (especially if the rubber
flap is torn off) is supposed to drain   through the small hole in the
sheet metal.  Pushed through the hole is a rubber "funnel" to which is
attached a short metal tube that in turn connects to a longer tube that
snakes its way over the right rear wheel well and into the storage space on
that side.  From there, the end  exits through a hole in the storage well
to the outside.  Now the problem may be the tube is draining directly into
the storage well.  Or the rubber funnel has been pushed into the fender
(like my '85) or is damaged, letting the fuel drain into the inside.  If
this is the case,  I speculate that even fumes may circulate into the hole.
  By pulling the carpet back on that side, it is possible to reach in there
and grab the drain tube and reposition it.

Good Luck,

Stu
