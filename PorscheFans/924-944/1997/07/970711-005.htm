        I raise the turbo up to the heavens and let out a
might roar.  The mighty Porsche gods have not denied me
my prize.  I collapse on the ground weeping, tears of joy
flow.


Then I get up and run to the little boys room.  As usual
I've put the Porsche above all else.  It is a struggle,
will I be able to get this last bolt before I wet my
pants?  Hold it, hold it....

Done.


The turbo is finally out.  My days of struggle are half
over.  I asses the situation:

I have one oily turbo.
I have dozens of little baggies.
I have one messy engine.
I have two bolts that aren't in little baggies. :(


I take the turbo to the girlfriend's neighbor.  He looks
at it and says "I tell you you've wasted your time,  it
isn't your turbo that's broken."  I grab the turbo from
him and hit him in the face.  I hear his curses as I run
away, holding my prize.

I don't care, I will have an oil free intake.  No longer
will I have to restrain from full throttle at the track.
I will blow by everyone, laughing, hahahaha.

Subject: 951 Head Gasket Options...Help!!!
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/
Message-Id: <01213326600038@ioio.com>

            I am unfortunately having to rebuild the engine in my newly
aquired 86 951.  I have been on the LIST now for a while, and have seen
a few posts about upgraded head gaskets.  I'm running stage 2 chips and
my waste gate has been shimmed, so I'm running a little higher boost
than stock and don't want to have to worry about my head gasket.  What
are  the options for head gaskets. Where can you buy them and how much
do they cost.

            Thanks in advance,
            Adam Gutierrez 1986 951, Jacksonville, FL
