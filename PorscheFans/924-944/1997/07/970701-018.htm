Hey Michael,

It's really funny 'cause I just drove from Qu=E9bec and all the time I ha=
d
some clowns like that on my ass. The best thing is on the hilly side of
Virginia on 77 to let the car go down the hill and see everybody ride
the brakes in each and every courb... and you fell the car just turn
like on rails... whomever is running your ass just stays far far away. =


Talking about Nascar boys, I've got some of those, even in Canada, with
a old F-body (camaro/pontiac - all the same stuff different names) that
asked me if I had an 8 under the hood of my 924S. This day I was a
little Pi.. Off and I flated ... ( BTW the engine really changes after
4000 rpm). He saw me latter on a red light ...big eyed tring to figure
out what the hell I was driving...

Take care =
