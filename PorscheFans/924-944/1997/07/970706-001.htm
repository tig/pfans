	Well, some of us anyway :) I was in Denver last week and
	picked up an Auto Trader just to leaf through. Man, I can't
	believe what our Rocky Mountain brethern have to pay for
	their cars. 944's that go for 3-4K here in TX cost 5K and
	up there. I could probably get 12K for mine. There was an
	ad for a 75 911S (traditionally held to be the worst
	model) with a price of 19K. That's an 8K car in Dallas.
	19K can get you 83SC or an 84 Carerra down here. Unbelievable!
	Just goes to show you that if you have the resources, you
	should shop around the entire country. When I decide to sell
	mine, maybe I'll try and transer  the ownership to CO :)
