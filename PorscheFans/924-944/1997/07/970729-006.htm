And so I ask...

What's "judder"?  This was the first time I have heard of it, so I looked
it up.  My spell checker never heard of "judder".  Time to try the
Webster's Dictionary.  Basically the dictionary said to see "shudder".
Upon looking up "shudder" I was directed to look up "judder", and so it
goes.

Speaking of judder, shudder, or peanut butter, my 89 Turbo exhibits a
judder, shudder at launch (that's launch, not lunch, your thinking peanut
butter).

The warmer it gets, the greater the shudder/judder as I turn the rudder
(okay, the wheel) and putter down the road.

At first I thought it was the clutch (just put one of those Turbo Cup
clutches in), or I might be dogging it when I start, but I got the
shudders/judders when I started crossing bumps after a recent road rally.
It sounded like I was losing the exhaust or a wheel or something.

I immediately put the car up on stands after my arrival to check the tail.
We did have a few DNFs during the rally and I wanted to make sure I hadn't
snagged any of those cars under the rear wheels.

I could find no signs of excessive play in the exhaust, the CV joints, or
wheels.  I did notice that I could rock the transaxle back and forth by
grabbing the oil cooler and shaking.  I tried the same thing with my 87
944S (55K miles) and found it about as loose.

Could the rear transaxle mount cause the car to shudder/judder when you
launch your car at lunch turning the rudder, as I begin to putter, munching
on a sandwich of peanut butter, yet the car will never stutter, tracking
true, not in the gutter?

Anyone have an experience like this?  Really!
