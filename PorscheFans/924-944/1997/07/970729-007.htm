Thanks for your suggestion, the window couldn't be pushed down, and I=20
haven't managed to get the electric motor off yet as I don't currently have=
=20
the correct tools=2E
But the question I have is, my local Porsche dealer can only supply a new=20
motor with a new gearbox, but most Porsche specialists will supply a motor=20
only (one third of the cost), is it an easy job fitting  a motor to the=20
gearbox , especially as you mention that you couldn't get the motor=20
completely out, why was that ?

Thanks
Ray Stacey
