well after replacing my tie rod end, the whell still shook so i went to my local firestone and they let me use the lift fr a few minutes. the dealership forgot to mention that the ball joint was bad as well. (wonder if there is any way, well never mind)  i am now stuck having to replace the lower control arm.  i have contemplated the FABCAR arms as i one day hope to track the car and drive one of the others daily. however they are mighty expensive.  while looking through some parts stuff on the net it appears that a 968 has the same lower arms. at any rate i guess my question is what are my replacement options?  and what else should i do while i am replacing it?  does anyone have one (right side) for sale? and finally how hard is replacing it going to be? seems pretty straight forward but you never know i guess.  

TIA,
matt
