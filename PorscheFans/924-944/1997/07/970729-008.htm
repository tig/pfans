Some of you may remember that a few months ago I posted a recount of
my experience resealing the glass on the hatch on my 924. Well, here I
am some 5000 miles later, and the sealant I used turns out to have clearly
been inferior. I used 3M's Black Weatherstrip adhesive, and while it went
together OK (although messily), it just was not up to the job.

I found that, over time, it has become less pliable, leading it to peel up in
places. I found that, in some areas, it appears to have become aerated
and full of cavities, probably as a result of degradation. Finally, and I think
that this is specific to the application, it just doesn't seem to have enough
thickness to provide enough cushioning of the glass. In some places, the
glass is resting directly on the metal of the frame. This concerns me,
since I'm now hearing plenty of rattling in the back from the glass.

So, I'm willing to try again to re-glue the glass, since it's mostly just my
wasted time, and I have plenty of that!  Does anyone have any
recommendations on a specific brand and product that they _have used_
in the past, for this application, with success?

TIA...
