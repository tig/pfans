Hi there:

I don't think I've ever done something stupid as what I did tonight..
while replacing worn out windshield wiper blades, one of the arms without 
a blade on it smack accidentally against the glass and left a huge bullseye
at the bottom of the windshield (1 1/2" - 2").  And I have my doubts that 
it can be fixed.

I'm located in Northern Colorado (anywhere from Denver thru Ft.Collins) and 
was wondering whether anyone had any suggestions as to where to go to have 
it replaced.  How much is a Porsche original?  *gasp*.. don't dare to even 
ask. (with the antenna embedded and all that) Any good shops around which 
can do a job worthy of a Porsche?

Thanks a bunch.

Feeling extremely stupid,
Chris

PS: Anybody else besides me who hasn't gotten a message in days?
