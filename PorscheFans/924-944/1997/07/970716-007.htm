Hi Everyone;

   I'm hoping some of you might be able to
shed some light on a few items for me. Any
advice, help, opinions, or words of wisdom
are most welcome! These items unfortunately
all seem to be a bit beyond the Haynes manual
that I have, so I cannot really dignose whats
going on. Also, does anybody know if the
Porsche 944 service manuals are now available
anywhere? (Automotion, Porsche, etc)

Car:
1986 Porsche 944NA
40000 Miles
Stored for 1.5 years (engine run fairly
regularly)
Very good condition in appearance
All belts and brakes changed before storage
No accidents, just not driven much recently


Problems:
1.  A/C on/off switch refuses to stick down
in the on position (lights up OK if held
down, and hear lots of clicks, etc) Do I need
to replace whole A/C control panel? Anybody
seen this problem, can switch be fixed
perhaps?

2.  A/C does not blow cold air, any advice on
Freon/R134 issues? Any known problems with
compressors, etc? This one is probably going
to need professional attention, but the more
I know, the better I will feel!

3.  Central Door locks do not function. When
the dash switch is pressed, I hear a relay
click; the red warning light works as I
believe it should, but nothing happens to the
door buttons on either side. Same scenario
when I lock the drivers door with the key, I
get a relay clicking, but nothing happens.

4. How hard is it to change motor mounts? Do
you have to dismantle the whole car, or is it
feasable to do this job on jack stands in a
garage without having to spend days on it?
(normal tools, normal skills etc)

5. Electric hatch release only seems to
release one side of the catches. Note that
this is probably likely an adjustment of the
pins, or perhaps it might be due to the fact
that the hatch struts are dead, and the hatch
does not pop up at all when released.
Opinions?


Many, Many Thanks;
