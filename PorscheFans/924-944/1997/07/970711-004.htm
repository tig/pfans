Subject: Sorry I goofed! (Re: 17" Wheels)
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     My mechanics forgot to tell me that my Borbets came in TWO BOXES, each 
     with their own UPS shipping labels.  They only told me what one label 
     said and I naively assumed (and wanted to believe) that the figure was 
     for all 4 wheels!  So, the Borbet's are NOT lighter than my original 
     phone dials (which would make sense because the car did NOT feel 
     faster anyway).  But they sure as hell look and feel a lot better.  
     Sorry for the confusion!
        I bet someone out there thought I was insane when I made that post! 
      But then again, I asked a bunch of other folks if the first figure 
     sounded accurate and they all said "Of course!"

     said, "Bob is on vacation.  Would you like to hold?"

Subject: Re: URGENT! BALL JOINT/ARM REPLACEMENT!
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I want to thank everyone for their help on this emergency!  I was 
     going to try and thank everyone personally, but I was flooded with so 
     many helpful responses that it would take me at least an hour to write 
     everyone back!
     
        I opted to go with the arms that my shop recommended, which were 
     the ones from ZIMS.  They were ~$250 and overnight shipping was thrown 
     in for free because my shop has given them a lot of business on these 
     things.  I inspected the arm myself, and it is really beautiful (would 
     make a great office desk ornament or paperweight) and the quality of 
     the rebuild was superb.  While many of you have said that a greasable 
     joint shouldn't be necessary, I kind of like this maintenance feature 
     since I plan to keep the car for a long time.  Also, the other 
     rebuilds ($150) cost another $100 to have the bushings replaced, and 
     the ZIMS already had these done so prices for the 2 are about equal.  
     While the bushings on my old arm were fine, I don't have the updated 
     power steering fluid hose yet, and I am more comfortable paying a 
     little more to have a "fresh" part as I wait to have the slowly oozing 
     hose replaced in a few weeks.
     
     For those who are curious, I had to replace the passenger side lower 
     arm because I had a torn boot over the joint that was discovered 2 
     years and 12,000 miles ago.  At the time, my mechanic had said it 
     would not require immediate attention and warned me that it would 
     probably have to be replaced soon.  Well, he was right.  My car is NOT 
     lowered in the front, and has never been tracked.
     
     Thanks again everyone!
     
     Ben
