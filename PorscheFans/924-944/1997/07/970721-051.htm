Apology accepted.  I am primarily an auto-x junky, mainly because it's
cheap :)  I am moving moreso into track events after all the fun days I've
had at the track with the 944 and the previous car.  You may remember a post
a while back where we did a Solo I at Mission Raceway and I had mentioned
how the 944 was a completely different animal than on the Auto-x.  It just
loved the high speed stuff.  I am likely going to a PCA event on Aug. 4th.
at PIR.  I haven't decided yet 100%, but if I can get a few parts in in
time, then I will go (brake pads, cool brake kit, etc.).

As for having Hansmen and I trying to see who is fastest.  Frankly, I would
rather blow the doors off a 'vette or something at a track than another
944.  When Paul and I go to track events, we are planning on coming up behind
this one air cooled car, and flying around him, one 944T on each side!

I also agree with you that dyno testing is not the be-all of car setup.
In fact, I feel it is almost worthless in car setup.  All it does is tell
you if you are making the power you should and where you are making it.
We did it as more of a fun thing to see how the car stands up to other makes
on the dyno.  When it comes to car setup, I am even more intricate.  Wait
until the race car debuts (hopefully some time next year) :)

The only thing stopping me right now from building the race car is that
I haven't been able *yet* to drive the 944 to its maximum consistently.  I
have these blazing fast days and then like this weekend, I'm 2-3 seconds
off the pace.  Until I can consistently run at the top, I'm not going to
change a thing on the car or build the race car.  It may sound stupid,
but I don't want to win with money, I want to win with ability.

Farzaan.
