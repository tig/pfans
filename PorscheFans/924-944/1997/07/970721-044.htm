For what it's worth, a buddy of mine traded in his pristine '96 Z28 6
speed on a used '93 VW Corrado VR6 and has not regretted it since.  He
says that the only thing he misses is the exhaust rumble, the
acceleration, and prices for parts.  Other than that he says he will
never own another F-car of any type again, and this after owning a pair
of T/A's and a couple of Z28's.  The handling on the car was ridiculous
at best, hopping from side to side every time it hit the slightest
irregularity on the road.  For the money, they are great buys, just
don't compare them to better engineered vehicles, like Porsches for
example.  I used to drive a brand new T/A (with TPI and WS6, etc.) back
in 1985 and I made the mistake of driving my dad's brand new 944 at the
time.  Ever since, I swore I would own my own Porsche some day.  I
finally bought a 968, which granted has a 3.0 liter engine, but it's a 4
cylinder, that's half the cylinders and almost half the displacement of
the latest F cars.  All things considered, the 944S2 and the 968 are not
bad performers when compared to the F's, plus 25mpg average too!

I still love the way T/A's and Z28's sound and accelerate, but for my
taste they're too big and heavy, and yes, their rear suspensions are a
joke.  Funny enough, I went to an F-body page not too long ago and read
advice from one F-car owner to another which read "Stay away from the
944 Turbo S, it will kick the crap out of a stock T/A or Z28."  And this
from a car with half the engine and "antique technology"!!  If any of
you remember the ad for the 951S: "For lunch it prefers Ferraris,
although it's been known to snack on Corvettes"  How true it is.
