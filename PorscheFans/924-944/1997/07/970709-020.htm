Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but I was told once that ram air
had no effect on HP for engines like the 944/951, due to the electronics
(DME, etc.) and their control inputs??? I stand to be corrected, of course.
:-)

None of the cars have ram-air stock, in any case, though all have cold-air
induction (which would still work, as a chassis dyno was used)

I found the dyno tests quite interesting, and useful for comparative
purposes even given your points. Of course the turbo cup chip has the
unfair advantage of not having to meet the same emissions edicts as the
other chips, but good fun nonetheless.

FWIW, most articles I've read shown the K&N makes no difference in engine
output over an optimized-for-perfomance factory system - *when* the factory
paper air filter is new. Many air filter assemblies in FWD cars are
optimized for noise reduction, and here a good cone filter does make a
difference - in noise and HP :-)
