If you buy a small hand pump, it's actually quite easy to drain and re-fill
the oil without raising the car. Compared to the front, there's plenty of
room to get underneath and work at the back of the car. As long as your
drain pan is short enough to fit under the exhaust and you have a way to
pump oil into the fill hole, you shouldn't have any problems. I've done it
twice this way.

One thought: Does raising the rear of the car affect the amount of oil the
transaxle holds before it spills out of the fill hole? I've been able to
get 2+ quarts in with my level-ground method, and when dealers/shops change
the oil I'm sure they do it on a lift where the car is level.
