Don't know if the problems you are having are the same..but when I 
first had my 944 I fund the rear hatch very difficult to open with 
the key.  The lock would turn only after a lot of force and I was 
worried about snapping the key in the process.

I dismantled the locking mechanisms..there are two, one below each 
locking pin.  They come out fairly easily and you can then disengage 
the rods that link the two together.  I then gave them a good soaking 
in penetrating oil, and then greased them up till they worked easily 
again.  Put the whole thing back together and its worked fine ever 
since.

If the key turns but doesnt unlock the hatch there must either be a 
linkage broken or disconnected or the lock is faulty.  Take the 
carpet away from the rear panel and operate the lock and see whats 
moving.  Its quite easy to see how the mechanism works, and you 
should be able to see whats at fault.

If the remote realease isn't working it could be either one of the 
same problems as above.  (the remote release still uses the same 
linkages), or the motor on the release is broken.  Can you hear the 
motor operate when you press the button?. Get someone to watch the 
likages or the motor (its on the right hand side as you look into the 
hatch from the rear), and see if anything moves.

Hope thats some help.
