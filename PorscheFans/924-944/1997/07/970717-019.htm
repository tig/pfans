You didn't think I'd let you get away with that email did you!

The factory race cars had professional drivers driving them that knew
how to drive, yet they still ruined the 951 by running them up to 310hp.

I weigh 120lbs so you should let me drive your car.

First off, it's Farzaan, second, get a life!  And then get a set of chips
on your 951 and see how much you like your car more.

You said yourself that this was the first time your 951 has worked correctly
and then you have the nerve to tell us all that we are ruining our cars
by chipping them?  Get used to the power you have, then 6 months down the
road, you will be emailing the list asking how you can get more power.

Farzaan.
