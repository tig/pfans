========================================================================

Farz,
  None of the cars you listed had a bleed valve between the wastegate
and
the valve on the intake manifold. My ? is how are you raising the boost
to 14 or 15 lbs. without the dme cutting you off? Also you said that the
K&N
filter does not do anything. I personally believe that a car sitting
still
hooked up to a dyno is not a fair evaluatio. I am a firm beleiver that a
ram air setup won't really show that much of a difference sitting in a
closed garage. However a little extra plumbing to help out the factory
air box coupled with a K&N filter, with air rushing in at about
75-100mph will improve hp period. On the dyno I doubt it. 
  In our quest for more hp every small item counts be it an air filter,
spark plugs, or even motor oil.
