Wes:

I think the server blew everyone out. It took me a day to realize it, and
re-sub. I guess that kinda takes care of the folks who didn't know how to
unsub :-).

     I think the top on my '86 951 is way too heavy to be fiberglass (it 
     also "pings" like metal when tapped too).  I have the tiniest ding 
     (actually just a shallow impression) in my sunroof, and as far as I 
     know, fiberglass doesn't dent like that.  It's as heavy as the one I 
     had on my '83 944, and I believe both are fabricated from metal.  I 
     bet the difference in materials also has something to do with the 
     944's we see on the road with flawless paint everywhere except on the 
     sunroof, where it's all faded and blotchy.
     
     By the way, for those people with Saratoga glass tops: make sure you 
     pop the sunroof up or at least crack down the windows a bit on hot, 
     sunny days.  Otherwise, you risk shattering your pretty sunroof 
     because of built up heat and pressure within the cabin of your car.  
     I've seen a moonroof turn into a "no-mo-roof" after spending a hot 
     afternoon closed in a parking lot.

I can confirm that -- both of my '89 951s have had fiberglass tops. Don't 
know about the earlier models.
