Konstantin,

Why do you want to reduce the engine temp on your car?  Is it over-heating?
 The temp gauge on these cars is a wild and wacky thing.  As long as it doesn't
go into the red, don't worry too much about it.

There are a number of supposed heat reducers out there.  Water Wetter, lower
temp. thermostats, lower temp. thermo switch.  All of these may or may not
lower engine temperature.  All of them are relatively cheap, so experimenting
isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg.

In general, make sure your cooling system is bled properly to ensure that there
is no air in the system.

I don't think anyone can reliably answer this question.  It all depends on the
car.  Since your already running more than stock boost, your chances of
breaking something are greater.

With that said, I don't think a K-27 is going to increase the chances of you
blowing a head gasket.
