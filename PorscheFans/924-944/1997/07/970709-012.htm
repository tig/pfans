Richard:
Misery loves company.  I recently replaced the turbo in my '82 931 for 
the same reason.  The PO had sucked bits of piston through the turbine
..  You don't want to know what the pistons looked like.

I made the mistake of buying a used turbo that was supposed to be 
rebuildable.  That one was trashed too, but by parting both turbos and 
buying the rebuild kit, I was able to take all to a commercial turbo 
repair place in my town for repair.  Cost about $200 for kit, $150 for 
labor.

If I had to do it all over again, I would save my pennies for an 
aftermarket turbo.  I wanted to get one from Turbonetics, but thought 
I was saving sooooo much money doing it myself...  If I had the turbo 
out still, I would like to call them and find out how they could 
upgrade the stock K26.  I know the carrera GT's used a larger turbine 
housing, no other difference.

There are probably some other companies that do rebuilds, as well.  
I'm just not sure if they can replace your blades or housings.  
I did see in the Turbonetics catalog that they can rebuild and upgrade 
turbos.  If you'd like their #, write me back and I'll bring it to 
work tomorrow.
