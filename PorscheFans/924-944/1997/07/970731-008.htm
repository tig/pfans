All,
    In the past, I have read postings recommending against turning Porsche 
rotors. What is the reasoning behind this? I replaced the front rotors this 
spring since they were worn. I am now experiencing pulsing brakes (or should I 
call this brake Judder!). It is difficult to tell if it is coming from the 
front or rear rotors. The vibration can be felt in the steering wheel. With 
the wheels off, I tried to determine if the rotors were warped. The new front 
rotors have a very slight (<1mm) warp to them. I am not sure if this is 
acceptable or not. The rear rotors have some grooves, and a bit more warp. Is 
it possible that the rear rotors are the culprits, and the vibration is being 
transmitted through the hydraulics to the front rotors, hence the steering 
wheel vibration? Other than some play in the front struts, the front end is 
completely tight as I also replaced the ball joints, tie rod ends and wheel 
bearings this spring. I am thinking of turning or replacing the rear rotors, 
and turning the front rotors. Since the front rotors are not grooved, I will 
keep the Mintex pads in use now, but will replace the rear brake pads.

Any words of Wisdom? 

Thanks,
       Ezra

                                 for Wheel re-finish)

Things Left to do & Parts to Order:
    o Heater flap Bearings (944.572.314 & 944.572.313)
    o 2 Seat Back release Handles
    o Rear Brake Pads
    o Turning of Rear Rotors or replacement
    o Turning of NEW front rotors (just to be sure)
    o Re-Sealing of Rear Hatch, awaiting identification of proper glue
    o Door lock/unlock electric actuator plastic rod thingy
    o Front faring repaint (Glassurit)
    o Rear faring repaint (Glassurit)
    o Side view mirror housing repaint (Glassurit)

Looking for the following, really cheap..
    o A/C compressor
    o A/C hose from compressor to condensor (re-build?)
    o Electric seat switch internals (2-way adjustable, no heat)

In Progress:
    o Rennsport Refinish of Rims (Local Tire shop Damage, they are paying)
