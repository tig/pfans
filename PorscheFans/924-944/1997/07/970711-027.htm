Well, I've been reading the list for quite some time now and have appreciated
the knowledge shared by all on our Porsches.  I just felt like rambling some,
so sorry to those of you who don't prefer long text, but I thought I'd share
my experiences with others who have probably been where I am now and for
those who are considering Porsche ownership for the first time.

I am currently on my second Porsche which is also my second 951.  My first
Porsche was an '89 951 - what a way to start Porsche ownership!!  I purchased
that car in Atlanta for very cheap as it needed some TLC but only had 58k
miles on it.  After having the car for 1.5 years, I sold the '89 last summer
for several thousand more than I paid for it - not bad.  The net/net was that
after a few typical reapairs I enjoyed Porsche ownership and sold the car to
break even.  I had a feeling that with 85k+ miles my luck was running out and
that major repairs were probably emminent.  This has been my philosphy on car
ownership for almost 10 years - buy cheap, thoroughly check the car out,
ALWAYS perform scheduled maintenance, repair/replace parts as necessary and
then re-sell at break even (or slight loss) before something major happens.  

Well, I just HAD to get another 951 (very addictive acceleration!!).  In
February I purchased an '86 951 for my (almost) daily driver.  Not quite as
peppy as the '89 and without airbags or ABS, but I didn't really miss it.
 The car was well maintained, purchased and lived all its life in my home
town in the southeast, never wrecked or chipped, had years of service records
(as it turned out the shop that maintained my '89 had serviced the car since
'92 - so it's history was well documented), came with a few extras (original
window sticker, bra, braided brake lines, race brake pads, etc.).  The only
drawbacks were early stages of blistering clear coat on the sunroof panel and
hood, 70k miles (low for an '86 but above my usual thresh hold) and worn
tires.  But, at $7,500 I felt it was a great deal.  All I did next was pay
tax ($500), perform lots of preventative maintenance ($1,250), purchase
floormats ($125) and a new alarm brain ($125) = $9,500 total investment for a
car I hoped to put little money into other than routine maintenance.

Well, I just couldn't wait anymore for new tires, so I ordered a new set
(bumped up sizes to 225/245s) last week.  Car was handling great on the way
back from the shop...then IT HAPPENED.

Engine shut off as I was going approximately 45 MPH and pulling around 3500
RPM - my first thought was that the alarm brain was went bad again and cut
the fuel off.  Then I tried to restart the car and heard the worst sound a
944 owner wants to hear...

I had the car towed on a flatbed to my faithful repair shop - the pulley that
tensions the (practically brand new 5 months old) cam belt apparently froze
(bad bearing) and bent every valve in the motor!  (Fortunately I didnt by an
S2 as I originally thought I might...)

As it turns out the valve guides are worn and will need to be replaced too,
along with other necessary services such as head gasket, oil change, radiator
flush (I just had the last two also done 5 months ago).  Looks like I'm going
to be out about $1,600 to the better part of $2,000 for the repair job (the
valves alone are almost $100 each x 8).  That includes the new turbo valve
that I've been needing to replace (was causing the common over-boost fuel cut
off problem when under boost under extended periods of time...)

Ouch!!!  So much for the vacation this summer!  Out of curiosity, do these
prices sound similar to what any of you have paid a reputable shop (not
dealer) to repair such damage?  (I'm in the southeast U.S.)

Well, for those of you who have been here I would appreciate your thoughts.
 Anything else I should do while the head is off the car?  I thought of
porting and polishing the head for better flow, but felt the money would be
better spent on a set of Autothority chips (I'll have a new head gasket -
less likely to fail I hope).  I'm dying to get to test out the new tires!!
 Can you believe it - just 15 minutes after the new tires were installed and
the car aligned...

Well, for those of you considering Porsche ownership here are my good and bad
stories.  Porsche ownership has its ups and downs.  You need to make sure
that before purchasing that you can either work on your own car or afford to
have a reputable mechanic do the work for you.  Fortunately for me, I can
afford the latter due to limited time and mechanic skills.  Even the best
background check and pre-purchase inspection is no guarantee that you'll have
no problems, so be prepared in the event that it does...

Would I get rid if the car?  I don't think I will just yet.  Would I buy
another car for myself other than a Porsche?  I seriously doubt it!!  This is
my fourth German car and I absolutely love the feel of a German car,  both in
build quality and handling/acceleration.  I've had too much fun driving my
951s, learning about them, and performing minor preventative
maintenance/repairs myself to change.  But, I always keep the wife with a
nearly new Vovlo just for times like this...

Sorry again for the long letter, but hope some of you enjoy sharing my
Porsche experiences!  Would be interested in hearing others comments too...

Andrew
'86 951 - back on road very soon! :)
