You said yourself that this was the first time your 951 has worked
correctly
and then you have the nerve to tell us all that we are ruining our cars
by chipping them?  Get used to the power you have, then 6 months down the
road, you will be emailing the list asking how you can get more power.



How right you are Farzaan, when I first bought a Suzuki GS550, I thought it
was a power house. 3 months later a Honda 750 Interceptor, wonderful power
band, and I thought who needs more power than this. Next season saw a 1000
Interceptor and last but not least a CBI 900 RR. You become accustomed to a
certain amount of power and then it becomes normal, then you crave more. I
have a 914 2.0, just purchased a 85.5 N/A( bought an Authority chip and the
car hasn`t even been delivered yet). So how far away can the purchase of a
951 be?
As with all high end pursuits, be it audio(tubes vs
transistors),cycling(Shimano vs Campagnolo), automobiles( Porsche vs
anything) or Race car drivers (A.J. vs Arye, got to watch those old fat
guys. They hit hard and are as mean as a Grizzly) we all want to pursue
what we feel as individuals is our personal levels of progression. After
all, owning a P-car is a sign of advancement to a higher level  ;).
Thanks for the time.

M.Selkirk.
