:)  I remember a time when I joined this list and everyone wanted to
keep their cars stock.  Power is addictive.  Luckily, these cars can
produce some impressive power with low cost.

With most of the chips available out there right now, even knock won't
be a problem.  If you use the boost bolt method, everything is still
computer controlled and should never have enough knock to destroy
your piston rings or head gasket.

I got a price of C$189 for a new one.  If you are going to go the
drilled cycling valve method, one of the list members said that John
Milledge uses that method till this day so it makes sense to purchase
it from him.  I drove Paul's car today to work (mine's getting the
pipe put on).  It's so nice to be able to drive a 951 to work even
when yours is in the shop :)  Anyway, with the boost bolt, the car will
only produce 0.2bar (1.2 gauge) at part throttle.  I find this really
irritating and I think Paul will be switching over to the drilled
method soon.

>applicable if you have the cycling valve drilled?

Nope, it does the same job in a different way.  In my car, we did try
both the bolt and cycling valve :)  20+lbs of boost was interesting.

I have become a real stickler for the factory air filter now :)  That dyno
result was the HIGHEST numbers the K&N produced in four runs.  Of the
four runs, 2 were at higher boost than my non-K&N runs and 1 was under.
The highest one turned out to be at slightly lower boost.  I found the
Dynojet extremely repeatable, but like you said, small differences such
as 2-3hp are not going to show up.

In all of my friend's Japanese turbo cars, the factory air filter is
so restrictive that you have no choice but to run an aftermarket
filter.  In those cases, gains of 10-15hp are not uncommon when using
a K&N.  Call me an idiot, but I did that paper test with the K&N
and am not convinced that it holds as much fine dust.  Does that small
dust do anything bad to the engine?  I don't know and I'm not about
to find out.

3-4hp does not justify taking a chance in my book, and air filters are
cheap on this car, something like C$12 every 10,000 miles is nothing!
