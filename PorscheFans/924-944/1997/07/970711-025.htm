Ben Trapp, you asked:
is $280 a good price to pay
     for ONE REBUILT ALUMINUM ARM?
___________________________________
Thats sounds like a good price to me.
I had the Ball Joint/Arm replace on my 951 about a year ago , but I had
it done at the Porsche dealership , and the job cost $880.00.
Tweeks was selling the Arm for , I think it was like 869.00, so of
course I just told the dealership to go for it, I didnt have the time to
mess with it myself anyway.
I personally am the type of person that refuses to use rebuilt anything
on anything I own, but that is just my preference, if it doesnt bother
you to use rebuilt I would place the order now for that price. That is
less than half what I paid.
Good Luck
        Don
