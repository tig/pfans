Subject: am i an idiot?

"My wife and I live in Manhattan, where a decent parking garage alone 
runs
about 4 bills a month. We had a 3 series Beamer droptop, which after
insurance, the car payment and the garage...was running about $1,200.00 a
month. (for a car that gets driven once or twice a week...)  Jeeze, for 
that
kinda dough couldn't I have a Turbo 911?
Anyway, we decided to be prudent, dump the Beamer and get something for 
cash
that was cheaper, yet still fun...hence the idea of getting a pristine 44 
was
born. Well, I found an 86 NA 44 which had 32,000 and was absolutely 
showroom,
inside and out. I payed $9,500.00 which was probably high, but I was in 
love.


That was back in December...(... had previously owned a 73- 914 and an 
85-
944)
I was running the numbers yesterday wondering what I had sunk into the 
new
one and was blown away. I did a clutch, alt, window regs on both sides, 
water
pump, timing belt/tensioners/ hoses, belts....a bunch of aftermarket 
toys,
rear speakers...
anyway...turns out I've got about $16, 500.00 into her, total.
She's perfect in every way now, but if I needed or wanted to sell her, 
I'd
lose my ass.

I guess, I just have to figure that this is going to be my ride for a
while..which suits me fine. What I'm trying to say here is that I've read
many posts from people looking to buy 44's. Be prepared to sink some
dough...it's a reality. And...don't go overboard unless you're gunna keep 
her
around a while. "

Boy , can I relate to this.  I also live in Manhattan and you are right 
on target about the cost of garage, the number of times I use my car and 
the cost of maintaining a 944 in tip top shape.  I also had a 85 944, and 
back in 1994, I was beginning to have to replace a lot of things, which 
is why I decided then to get a brand new 968 , and that was the best 
thing I did , as I have not had any maintenance costs except for regular 
servicing.   The other downside of a garage in Manhattan is that you have 
to let the parking attendants do the parking, and these guys cost me a 
new clutch after only 15, 000 miles on a replacement clutch I put 
on the 944.  Since, I have found a garage which , for a premium of 
course, let's me park and lock.  My clutch is still going on very strong 
with 27,000 miles on it.

Am I an idiot, too?

Naaahh!! It's worth it when you take it out of the city and go for one of 
those longer drives  and catch one of those great country roads!!!
