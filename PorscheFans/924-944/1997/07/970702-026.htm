     I received a recall notice for my 951 today. (shows the importance of 
     registering with PCNA when you buy your used Porsche). Anyway, the 
     card entitles me to a replacement of my fuel hoses and fuel rail (and 
     hopefully the injectors too). Is this a new campaign or are they just 
     catching up with un-updated cars? Have other members on the list had 
     this operation done? Did you get new injectors?
     
     I'm guessing they are replacing parts that leak and cause engine 
     fires. (which are very bad) and I never object to getting new parts 
     for free so... 
     
     I do all of my own service (except tire mounting and alignments) so 
     I'm feeling a little edgy about leaving the car and letting anyone 
     mess with it. Curious to see how the factory techs react to my 
     slightly "enhanced" car.
     
     
     
     Thanks,
