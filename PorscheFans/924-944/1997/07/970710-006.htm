Subject: New 944 owner



I am just completing the purchase of my second Porsche(current 914 =
owner). The car I`m purchasing is a 85.5 NA with about 135k =
kilometers(approx 85k miles). In the last 20k kilometers the car has had =
the following service work done: Timing belt and balance shaft =
belts(including all rollers and pulleys), camshaft cover seal,all =
coolant hoses,tune-up incl. all filters, all fluids replaced incl. brake =
fluid, new rotors and semi-metallic pads, both front control arms, =
clutch(at 90k),all tires and a Sony AM/FM cass. pullout unit. The car is =
Garnet ext. with Ivory int. Most of the regular options with the =
addition of sport electric and heated front seats. The car is very clean =
and the current owner has receipts dating back about 7yrs. His ad said =
"owned and maintained by fussy,mature middled aged owner" and from what =
I could see he was quite honest. The A/C does not work due to a hole in =
the condensor core(any suggestions who best to purchase a new one from?) =
and other than that all devices function properly. Questions: when =
started,the idle was ever so slighly rough(not annoying) and I am =
extremly fussy myself. Could this be the start of the motor mounts =
needing to be replaced? Second, what if any aftermarket improvements are =
most desirable? Third, what is the largest phone dial wheel and tire =
combo I can put on this car? Last, does the list somewhere contain the =
option codes for this car? I am a current PCA member and I`m looking =
forward to using this vehicle as my second family car( young children =
will fit in the back on occaision). Any advice/suggestions would be =
greatly appreciated. Sorry, forgot to mention that the waterpump was =
also replaced.
With respect
Mark A Selkirk.
