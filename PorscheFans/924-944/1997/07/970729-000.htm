I tried to post this to the list, but it would not let me.  Maybe you
could post it for me.

I had my belts replaced, and had a little bit of belt whine after a week. 
 I only noticed it at startup and for the first half mile.  At 2000 miles I 
had them retensioned, like you are supposed too, and the shop said that 
they were loose.  I thought that the whine was because they were too tight. 
 THE WHINE IS BECAUSE THE BELTS ARE LOOSE!  I was glad I had them 
retensioned as recommended.  The retension cost me $37.
On another note.  A while back I posted that my '86 944 was not 
accelerating smoothly at partial throttle.  It turned out to be the oxygen 
sensor.  I unplugged it from the engine wiring harness in the engine bay, 
and it ran perfectly smooth, and it seems to pull stronger.  I left it 
unplugged for two weeks.  However I needed to have it emission tested, so I 
put it back on and drove to the test station.  My emissions worsened about 
20%, although still very low, from the test last year.  This could be just 
the testing equipment variance.  But I have decided to replace the oxygen 
sensor rather than run without it and risk cooking my catalytic converter 
with a rich fuel mixture.
