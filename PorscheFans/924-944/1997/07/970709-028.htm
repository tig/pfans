Jeff:

The 951S has a bit more room for rubber under the fenders, as the lips are
rolled from the factory. I've got 7.5x17 and 9x17 Technology replicas with
225/45 and 255/40 on my 951S and there's absolutely no rubbing, and
apparently plenty of room to spare for a wider tire.

I contacted Wheel Enhancements regarding the largest possible rear tires
for my car, and this is the response I received from John Brown:
