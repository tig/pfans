I have a 1987 944S and it's a great car. You won't notice much difference
in power until you hit around 4200 RPM. After 4200 the 16 valves make a
difference. Around town and normal diving it's negligable. There's another
power peak about 5300 RPM. I don't know if the brakes are different but the
only 8 valve I've driven definately didn't brake as good as mine. Could be
pads etc. If you get the S check if the cam chain tensioner has been
replaced. If it fails it's a very expensive repair. I would look for the
LSD and M030 options and go for the car that has them. A $6000 price
difference is way out line. Should only be about $1000 tops. I've been
keeping tabs of all the Porsches advertised in Vancouver, Canada over the
past year and here's the prices for 86 & 87 944's in Canadian dollars. I
bought mine last August for $10500 and got taken. I've spent about $8000 in
repairs and now have a nice car. Make sure you get your car checked out
before you buy.
