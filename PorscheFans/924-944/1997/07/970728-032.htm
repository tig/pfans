Don't know if the problems you are having are the same..but when I =

first had my 944 I fund the rear hatch very difficult to open with =

the key.  The lock would turn only after a lot of force and I was =

worried about snapping the key in the process.

I dismantled the locking mechanisms..there are two, one below each =

locking pin.  They come out fairly easily and you can then disengage =

the rods that link the two together.  I then gave them a good soaking =

in penetrating oil, and then greased them up till they worked easily =

again.  Put the whole thing back together and its worked fine ever =

since.<

To adjust the locking mechanism, park the car on level ground, open the
hatch and loosen the 10mm nuts that hold the two latching mechanisms in
place.  Close the hatch and this should center the mechanisms.  Release t=
he
hatch and tighten the nuts.  Tech Tip:  If you over tighten the nuts the
mechanism will bind and not release or latch cleanly.  Screw in the locki=
ng
pins on the hatch until they just latch.  Then back them off about one ha=
lf
to one turn or so.  This should give you both a watertight seal and an ea=
sy
opening hatch.  BTW, if your hatch shocks are good, the hatch should open=

all the way when you press the button on level ground.

Happy hatch in SD
