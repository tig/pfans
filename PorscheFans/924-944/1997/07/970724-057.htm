Howdy,

I've got a friend here that is trying to sell his tires and I thought
you guys might be interested, I think it's a pretty good deal.  They
are Yokohama Nexus in 235/45R17 and 255/40R17 (perfect for 944 Turbo
guys).  He drove them to and from a show and that's it.  He wants
US$695 for them.  I don't think he's including shipping in that price,
I know I wouldn't :)

email Kerwin at jefflaw@direct.ca if you are interested.  Tell him I
sent you from the Porsche list and maybe you and him can bargain a 
bit.

Farzaan.
