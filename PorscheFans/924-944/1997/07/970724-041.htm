Why not get PCNA to set up a good listserver off there Porsche.com site.
They have the money to do it properly. The could put a small ad at the
foot of the message advertising product lines or parts. I'd rather they
put $10 onto the price of the new cars they sell than someone charging
me $10 to pay for an acceptable upgrade.
I too enjoy the list and the ability to communicate with Porsche owners
around the World.

This is a suggestion, not a complaint.  I am constantly greatful that
the list
is here and works as well as it does.  Thank you, list keeper.

Maybe we all need to volunteer some $ (as in annual dues, or something)
to someone who is willing to run the list as a "business."  With nearly
2000 members, $10 apiece will buy a fair amount of hardware/software.

Just a thought.

James
