Jeff:

Was at Road America and just caught up on P-fans reading.  Hope I'm not
repeating an answer mixed among the multiple posts.

If you are talking about a side-to-side slopiness in the feel of your shift
lever, you need to replace the lever itself.  There is a "finger" on the
side of the shift lever that goes through the end of the shift rod (if
that's what it' called).  Over time, it wears and will feel sloppy.

To change:  remove shift knob, boot, and rubber cover.  Remove the circlip
from the "finger" that goes through the shift rod.  The finger will then
back right out.  There are 2 bolts (one ahead and one behind the lever that
hold a "plate" in place where the pivot point is (I think they have 10mm
heads), you will need about a 2"-3" extension to your socket wrench to
easily get to these.  Pull the old lever out of the plastic socket,  the
socket may be brittle and break, so it's probably worth picking an extra
one up when you get the new lever.  I have found that heating the new
socket to about 175 degrees (in the toaster oven) allows the ball of the
new lever to pop right in.  (broke 2 of these, trying to insert in a 50
degree garage.  Then... put it all back together and use a generous amount
of anti-seize on the new "finger".  I neglected to do this and wore a new
lever to the point where it annoyed me in 12 track days.

New lever is about $36, the plastic sockets are around $3, I think.

I hope this makes sense, not difficult at all to do yourself.
