Bob, this is a very valid comment:

Stock engines differ a lot between when quite new, up to 10 % up and
down is not unheard of in 'simpler' engines. Now, Porsche may do a
better engine building job, with greater consistenmcy than most, but
even a small difference of +/- 2.5 % will still mean that two identical
(219 HP stock) cars can have between 213 and 225 HP. Incidentally, these
are the claims many aftermarket tuning parts companys make, probably
well aware that dyno readings and athmospheric variations will vary the
result as much and make claims look credible and backed up by dyno
readings. 

Now, a large number of data points (measuring instances) will tell the
story in no uncertain terms, but that is probably not within the scope
of amateurs, hiring a expensive dyno.     

Another thought about differing HP is that many think that Porsche is
conservative with their advertised HP ratings. It just may be that they
are aware of the HP span, and quotes from the low end?

Be that as it may, the thing to remember is that the precision of
rolling-road type dynos may not be enough to see very small differences
without a lot of runs.
