P Fans:

I have a no start condition on a NA 85.  There is no spark while cranking. 

Ignition coil is receiving 12 volts with ignition on, and while cranking it
drops below 11 volts.  Does anyone know what the AC output of the flywheel
sensors BG & DG should be.  One is the speed sensor and I believe the other
is a reference sensor.  All other fuel injection related sensors check out
with voltage and ohms tests.

Previous to this condition the car would hesitate under acceleration.  Just
before the car refused to start, it was hard to start.  Under the
hard-to-start condition, once started the idle was very rough, near
stalling, and if you tried to accelerate hard the car would die immediately.
This hard-to-start condition only lasted a day; then it refused to start.

Any help would be appreciated.
