I had opportunity to have a look-see on a proper racing car the other
day, cpmpeting in one of the racing standard car classes over here.
There was one clever and reputedly effective gadget that caught my eye -
because it was so simple.

It was a cooling device that cooled the charge cooler (intercooler) to
the turbo. It consisted of a high pressure nozzle, that sprayed the
intercooler from the front, where the airstream (thru' evaporation)
immediately lowers the temperature - and makes the charge density go
up.  
After some inquirys, i found that the nozzle was fed water from the
standard windscreen/headlight washer system, and basically was just a
replaced nozzle and manually invoked when the need for some extra edge
was anticipated, mostly right before curves.                       

I forward this tip FWIW, as it seems to me that it could be incorporated
for very low cost. Those I was talking to said that it was working OK,
and many seemed to use it.

Regards, and a happy 4th of July!
