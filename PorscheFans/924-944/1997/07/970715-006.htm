I installed a VDO oil temperature gauge last Winter.  I bought it from Racer
Wholesale in Georgia.  It fits into a neat plexiglass panel along with VDO
boost and water temperture gauges in my center dash bezel.  I fabricated this
set-up from a used dash vent assembly which I bought from Partsheaven for
about $25.  I took out the center vents and constructed a panel from matte
black plexiglass.  All connections are on plugs so I can easily remove the
entire assembly during non-competition driving.  It takes about 15 minutes to
change back and forth.  The plexiglass panel has a slot about 1/4 inch tall
at the bottom for air flow.

For the oil temperature sender, I drilled out an oil drain plug.  This took a
really strong bit to get through the magnet.  I then tapped the appropriate
hole and screwed in the sender.  A single wire runs back through the engine
compartment and firewall to the special gauge panel plug.  The sender thus
measures temp in the pan, which may not be totally accurate when th engine is
running-- everything is relative.  With the stock turbo oil cooler, I've seen
on-track temps as high as 250-260 degrees F on a warm day, all while reading
mid-range water tempertures and using Redline oil.  With the too large Mocal
oil cooler in series with the factory unit, I never went above 200 degrees F,
but the water got too hot.  With the Terbatrol cooler in series with the
factory unit, I don't have on track data yet.  Testing is scheduled for 7/25.

To get a reading for the water temp gauge, I use the wire coming from the
existing sendor.  You cannot get a true reading if you try to drive both the
factory gauge and a separate VDO-type gauge from the same sender unless you
include a properly chosen resistor in the circuit.  I didn't fool with this.
 Instead, I have it rigged so that I can use either gauge by just changing in
a wire in the engine compartment.  It seems that the lower white bar on the
factory gauge corresponds to about 180-190 degrees F.
