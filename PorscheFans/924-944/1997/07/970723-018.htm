P-Fans,

Thought I'd share one of the more significant experiences in my life.  Was
going out to dinner last evening (in Laramie, WY), happened to be driving
my S2 (the Pathfinder is having its hood painted), and saw 4 911s, 3
Boxsters, 1 BMW Z3 and about 10 chase trucks pull into the parking lot of
the local Comfort Inn.  Had to check it out. The 911s were all 996s. When I
asked for verification from the crowd of guys standing around, they said
the couldn't say, etc. etc. But I was finally invited to have a quick look.
Didn't think the 996 was such a big secret anymore.  I think most of the
folks were Porsche people (German accents), with a few C&D, R&T types
thrown in.  In talking w/ one of the Germans, turns out he was project
manager for 2 years on the development of the 944 S2.  Felt like I was
meeting the Pope or something. He said it was a great car, much better than
the 951 (naw, he didn't really say that, but it would have been cool).

I mentioned that the slab sides on the 996 didn't look as bad as I thought
they would, and I was told that everyone would just have to get used to the
shape, and that the 996 was as close to a perfect car that Porsche had
built.  They wouldn't let me test drive one, so I can't verify this.  All
the 996s were dark gray, and looked great.  However, I'm not sure they'd
look as good in red, yellow, etc.  The straighter lines and the lack of
bulging rear fenders somehow demand a serious color.

My overdriving emotion was total envy for jobs these guys have. Felt like
quitting my faculty position and tagging along just in case they needed a
nonprofessional opinion on performance.  When I left the parking lot, I was
revving the S2 a little louder than usual, and I felt absolutely great --
euphoric.  The gods had descended from Olympus and I had received
benediction. Great to be part of the Porsche family.  

Forgot to ask why the BMW was along for the trek, but oddly enough it was
the only car with its hood up.
