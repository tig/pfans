The compressor won't engage, because the low pressure switch is open,
protecting the compressor, as it doesn't see pressure in the system, and
assumes the oil is gone as well.  The compressor oil will not circulate
without refrigerant, and the compressor would seize in short order
otherwise. 

I would recommend having a shop do the work, for the following reasons:  
The system must be flushed and evacuated of the old oil and moisture.  
The oil used with R12 is incompatible with that used for R134a and must be 
removed.  When the system is pulled down to evacuate, they can determine 
easily if there are any leaks that need to be fixed.  They will recharge 
with the proper amount of oil as specified for the system.

They will also have the gauge set, so when the system is recharged, you 
can be confident the pressures are correct, and that your compressor is 
performing properly.  A worn compressor will not develop high enough head 
pressure to provide good cooling, even with a proper refrigerant charge.

Sorry I don't have a specific answer, but aside from just topping up the 
charge from a can, I tend to let the folks with the proper equipment do 
A/C work.   MHO. ;-)

 -Gregor - 89 944 2.7 with a slightly low R12 charge.
