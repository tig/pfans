1986 944 TURBO FOR SALE:

I am reluctantly putting my 951 up for sale.  For those of you in the market
for a 944 please read on...

what's great about this car:
- all original '86 951 with 71,000 miles
- dark grey with light tan leather interior
- never raced or modified
- BRAND NEW Dunlop D40M2s (225s/245s)
- yellow Koni sport shocks
- K&N air filter
- complete service records with all maintenance up to date
- same mechanic for over 7 years
- extras include original window sticker, bra, braided brake lines, Ferodo
brake pads, nice 'Porsche' embroidered floor mats, and more
- car has always been in Charlotte, NC
- recent head work includes new valves, head gasket, etc.  (belt tensioner
bearing failed...)
- no cracks in the original dash
- cold A/C, cruise control, 

what's not so great about the car:
- sunroof and hood paint is in poor shape (clear coat is dead) remainder of
car has paint that is in above average condition
- phone dials aren't cosmetically perfect (again dead paint)
- winshield has a crack in it from a rock

This is my second 944 Turbo and I really will miss this car, but I am
returning to graduate school for my MBA full time (i.e. no job) and will not
be able to properly maintain the car, so I'd rather sell it to someone who
will be able
to enjoy it.  If something as simple as an alternator or not so simple as a
clutch were to go out, I would be out of luck and without transportation.

This car would be perfect for a track car or for someone looking for a well
maintained but reasonably priced 944 Turbo.  I have set the price at a
negotiable $8,000.  Only if  you're seriously interested, please call Andrew
at (704) 375-1292 - feel free to leave a message if I'm not at home.  Please,
no dreamers, low-ballers or someone hoping to find a $6,000 944 Turbo.  I'd
rather put a car cover on the car, share my wife's car with her, and let the
944 sit with plans to race the car after graduate school...
