Rod,
    I own an N/A '86 944, and also received the recall notice you mentioned on 
July 2nd for replacement of "fuel hoses and fuel rail". I had this  service 
done yesterday, at the only porsche dealer in Vermont (They required the 
vehicle for the entire day). They only replaced a single rubber fuel hose, 
about 5 inches long. I received a phone call this AM from the dealer service 
dept., they seem to be having some difficulty submitting the claim to PCNA. I 
still have the PCNA postcard, of which the dealer has requested a copy. I will 
call PCNA after work to get more details on exactly what was supposed to be 
done. Has anyone else had this service performed? (I believe the recall was 
L01 or L02)

Thanks,
       Ezra
