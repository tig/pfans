In reference to my previously posted letter, what is the overwhelming opinion
on putting a non-stock head gasket on a 951?  If you recommende who's part
would you use, why, and approx. how much does it cost?

I'm am considering installing an Autothority chip or other brand - but what
are the pros and cons of each brand and what are the cons of chipping in
general?

The operative word for any modifications for me will be RELIABILITY!!!  After
spending the better part of $2k to replace all 8 bent valves due to a
tensioning pully going bad I do not wish to replace head gaskets on a regular
basis of I chip the car and overboost it.  Likewise, I rather not melt down
pistions, rods, etc.  I'm thinking somewhere in the range of 275+/- dyno (not
road) horsepower to keep both the car and myself out of trouble.

Any suggestions for RELIABLE horsepower would be appreciated.  The only mods
from current stock setup on my '86 951 is increased tire sizes to Turbo-S
specs and a K&N filter provided by the previous owner.  I'd rather check with
you guys first since you sound like the experts.  Am I asking for too much
with reliability and 50+ more horsepower?

Thanks,
Andrew

'86 951 - back on road soon!!
