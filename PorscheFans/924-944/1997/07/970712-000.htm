Porsche fans,
 In the last couple of weeks I have read a few e mails regarding bad
Amoco or Exon fuel.
You can not blame these findings on the gas itself rather it is where
the fuel is stored. The fuel is stored in large underground tanks. If
the fuel is left underground too long condensation enters the fuel. The
moral here is try to buy from a station that does a lot of business,
thus insuring yourself of a fresh tank of fuel. Personally I use Sunoco
94 and have had no problems, also use Chevron Techron fuel injector
cleaner every 3rd or 4th tankful. 
Steer clear of the station that looks like they haven't sold fuel in a
week.
 They probably haven't.
