I ask those Turbo gurus out there to give me knowledge.

First, what is the opinion about the Wide Fire Ring gasket for the 951 and
the 951S?

Is it good, bad, or indifferent compared to the OEM gasket?


Second, after replacing said gasket in my 89 Turbo, I notice a small amount
of foam in my coolant reservoir, particularly after engaging the turbo
charger.  This is as soon as I stop the car when I destinate.

Also, each morning I check the coolant level in the reservoir, oil level,
etc., when it is cold.  The coolant level, as seen across the face of the
translucent reservoir, will vary as much as plus and minus one inch from
morning to morning.

Is this normal?  Why would the coolant level vary so much?  Could the
gravitational pull of the moon cause tidal effects in the reservoir?  Could
another comet be coming?

Seriously, this is my first dance with a Turbo, but all my previous
normally aspirated cars' coolant remained rock steady from day to day.

Any clues on this behavior?  Is the Wide Fire Ring gasket a known problem
or a secure fix to blown head gaskets?

Thanks in advance,
