<< Pfans,
 
 Thanks again to all that anwered the 924s vs 944 questions.  I went with the
944
 frankly because I found a good one 
 (snip).....

 A few questions.  I love the car as it is, but would like some more HP.
    Also will need tires in a couple months I'm sure.  Any advice from those
in the know?  
(snip)......

Thanks again for all your help.  Oh, and my two cents.... computers
occasionally
 screw up...  that's life.  
 (snip)......

 I do look forward to receiving this list, and the Hansman/Farzaan/951 guys
very
 nearly had me in one of those.  This is only Porsche number one, maybe next
 year.

Sorry about taking up the BW but I just wanted to thank Bill for this post
and say that this is what this list is all about . . . . . . expressing our
opinions in a civil manner, asking for advice when we need it, and being
willing to share our experiences when someone asks for our opinion.
