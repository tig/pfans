Tim,

It would seem that the small amount of surfactant (Waterwetter ~250 ml)
added to the far larger volume of coolant would have a negligible impact on
the heat capacity of the system coolant.

What would seem more reasonable for explaining the apparent lack of cooling
would be that the system is regulated by a thermostat.  That thermostat
will only open when the temperature reaches the trip point. Before that
there is little coolant flow and exchange to carry off the heat.  If the
system is operating well, and you add Waterwetter, I would be surprised to
see much difference except that you might not see the same high temperature
spikes.

Surfactants also allow better cooling by lowering the surface tension of
water so that it will better contact the interior metal surfaces that
surround the engine.  This improves the heat transfer efficiency, but you
still need an open thermostat to allow fluid displacement and recycling.
Plain old detergent is also a surfactant, but I would hesitate using that
in your coolant system!

Good post Tim!

Marv
