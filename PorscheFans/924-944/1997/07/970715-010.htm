The easy answer is that the right rear tire is toed out, or pointed away
from the car's centerline.  Another possibility is that the car may need a
serious rear alignment.  Some 944/924 chassis are out of spec in that the
rear torsion bar/trailing arm assembly points the tires a bit toward the
right or the left of center.  If this is the case, you may also experience
a small degree of front end wander away from whichever side the rear is
pointed.  That is, if the rear is slightly biased left, the effect wil be
to push the front of the car toward the right side of the road if you let
go of the steering wheel.  In the states, this is sometimes called "dog
tracking", as I'm not remembering the technical term at the moment.  "rear
steer" is another non tech term.  AAHHHHHH, now I remember!  THRUST ANGLE.
The rear tires generate a thrust angle away from centerline.

You asked about worn springs.  Springs rarely "wear".  The rear shocks may,
however, not be supporting the car equally from side to side.  But, unless
extreme,that shouldn't cause the kind of tire wear you've got.  A good
alignment shop and a new set of rear shocks should be able to fix it.
