I have two new problems with my 951.

1)  Whenever I turn the wheel there is a goaning noise like the power
steering pump or steering rack.  The pump is less that 1 year old.  I added
fluid to the resivoir and no matter how often I add fluid it seems to
"drink" it until it is just below the depth of the dipstick.  The fluid has
always seemed low but I have never had problems before.  No apparent leaks
on the garage floor.

2)  Now that the Georgia summer is here I find that my battery slowly
drains from driving with the AC on.  I had the dealer check the electrical
system last year because the voltmeter hovered around 12V until I turned on
the AC and/or lights and then it dropped to 11V but was still above the red
line.  The dealer said that all was fine but the guage was reading low so I
was happy.  Now I suspect they either did not load the system when they
checked it or something else is screwy.

Can anyone help???
Thanks!
Mark
