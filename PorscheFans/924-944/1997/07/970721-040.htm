Frank,

	My apologies to you and any list members that felt my comment to you that
stated "It would be a good idea if you guys stopped flooding the mail
server"  I'm also sorry that you found that comment rude, it wasn't meant
to be rude.  On the other hand your reply to the original thread and my
comment was less than polite to say the least.  I'm also sorry this had to
happen to you, you sound like you might be an okay guy, you already own a
cool car.  =)  Well I won't go any further due to the fact that I wish not
to create another thread on what's rude and what's not. So once again I'm
sorry for mistaking your mass of messages to me from the mail server as a
flood instigated by you.  (Then again it wouldn't be the first time that
someone has done this if you did, hence the so called rude comment from me
to stop)




							    	My Apologies
								
								Brent@calinet.com
