First, thanks to all for the advice to cure the hi speed miss in my '87
944S.  I did change the plugs, plug wires, dist., rotor, checked timing, and
on and on.  
After completion of the aforementioned, the miss was less, but not totally gone.
I have exclusively used AMOCO Ultimate in the car, so no one suspected a
fuel problem.  Until....While on a road trip I couldn't find an AMOCO
station, so I filled up with Phillips 66 93 Octane.  Within 50 miles, the
miss seemed to go away.  I will admit, that on the road I was not pushing it
too hard, so who knows.  When I got closer to home, I started being
aggressive, there was no hi speed miss!  I filled up with AMOCO Ultimate the
next day, and the miss was back!  Next tank I tried was Chevron, within 50
miles the miss was gone!  I have not put AMOCO back in the car yet.  I will
as soon as I get down to empty.  I won't fill it totally this time!  The
funny thing is that Phillips is almost .20 a gallon cheaper here in Champaign.  

This is not a scientific study I know.  I don't claim my findings to be
indicative of anything accept what I have personally found in the seat of my
too large pants.  But, I thought it worth passing along..could it be a local
additive for weather?   MTBE is not supposed to be in my area...but, could
it be?  The last part adds mystery though.  When verbalizing this to my
wife, she told me that her Audi seems to be getting rotten mileage, and she
thought it was just the weather.  Last nite we filled the Audi with
Phillips.  On our way home after about 30 miles, she was driving, she
commented that the car was not making that funny noise any more.  What funny
noise?  Oh that pinging it always gets when its hot, the a/c is on, and I go
up this hill!

As I said, YMMV
