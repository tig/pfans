I noticed the same thing when I replaced one of my guards with a factory
(alpine white) replacement a few years ago.  Since then, all the others had
crazed and looked terrible.  I then replaced the whole set with some clear
ones that I bought from a Panorama advertiser (Zim's, I think).  These were
much more reasonably priced than a whole set of white ones from the dealer
(approaching $300 as I recall) and after two years plus they have not
yellowed in the Florida sun.  

A word of advice to anyone thinking about doing this job themselves:  if
your guards have already reached the crazed stage, they will not simply
peel off when heated (as stated in the very optimistic instructions).  It
seems that when they get to this stage, the plastic and adhesive sort of
meld together into a sticky mess that does not want to come off the fender.
 I had to resort to careful use of razor blades and then scrubbing with
lacquer thinner!  Perhaps auto body shops have some tricks they use to make
this easier.  If so, it would be money well spent to let them do it.  Don't
say I didn't warn ya......
