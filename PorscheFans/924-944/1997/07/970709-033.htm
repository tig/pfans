<<The 924S is faster than the 944.  It has a lower coefficent of drag.  It
was originally brought to the US to compete with the Japanese sports car
market (Supra, 300ZX etc) and went for less than $20K, $6k less than the
944.  However, when the value of the Deuschemark declined, the price
went up to around $30K and sales declined.  Most people in this price
range spent the extra $6K on the 944.  I heard a story that someone lost
their job for producing a car that was faster than the 944 and cost
less.>>   

NOW wait a minute!  This story has a familiar ring to it...
(ie: the 951 vs. the 911)

If someone comes out with a "914 vs. 924" story that's also similar...I ain't
buyin' it!
I guess a lot of dudes at Porsche get canned for making better product
cheaper....
And the moral of this story??? If you're a smart engineer, better go work for
BMW!
HA!
