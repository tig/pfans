All,

A friend posted this message on another board:

>>>"I was a user of cool carbons, until I was convinced to try a set of
Hawks.  WHAT a difference!  Braking was improved a little bit, there was less
fade, and literally HALF the wear versus the cool carbons.  That there is
better braking with a 2 for 1 deal thrown in as far as I am concerned.  Plus,
if you order from Windward ($89 per axle) you get a free litre of Super Blue
(good stuff!).  Don't mean to sound like a salesman, but they are that
good."<<<

I REALLY miss the stopping power of my CCs.  Anybody have any experience with
the Hawks?  Of particular concern is rotor wear.
