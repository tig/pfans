Hi Rich
I would not start by spending money on ignition components, the basic
ignition components are adequate. Could you give us some more information?
Complete setup front and rear including alignments, springs, torsionbars
and swaybars. What tires do you use? What tires are allowed? How high is
your car (side panel to ground behind frontwheel and in front of rearwheel?
Where do you loose on the track? In or out of corners, accelleration,
braking, top speed?
Balancing the car is very difficult because when driving very hard you will
experience initial understeer into corners changing into oversteer in the
corner. When the front is to stiff in relation to the rear you will have to
much initial understeer and you will loose traction on the inside rearwheel
in tight corners resulting in wheelspin. The 924 and 944 are very difficult
to balance at racing speeds.
Furthermore you have 3 problems:
1/ Braking, you mentioned it already. The brakes of the 924S are adequate,
but not perfect because they have one piston calipers with a floating yoke.
A well maintained system, new fluid, well bleeded and well bedded pads will
perform very good with a hard enough pedal and good braking performance. At
racing speeds you should additionally cool your brakes and even if the
pedal will become much softer when everything is heating up, braking
performance will still be good without to much fading. In my slightly
modified 1983 944 daily driver (identical braking system to 924S) I can
outbrake 993's on the track from 200kmh down just before a tight 3rd gear
corner.
2/ Weight. A standard 924S is a heavy car. Weight is almost more important
to laptimes then hp, because of effects on braking, cornering and
acceleration. Remove whatever weight you can, like backrest of backseat,
spare tyre, radio, extra carpets, tools, windowwashing fluid, etc. Is it
possible to use a lightweight hood and rear glass panel (lexan)?
3/ Horsepower. Your car is underpowered, but it is difficult to find more
hp's easily. You need to boost compression ratio to 10.8, use a different
camshaft, flow the head, extrude-hone intake system, adjust DME to gain a
few hp's (180-190 hp). You can ask Jim Pasha, he is involved in NA 944
racing or try to find a contact in England, where a lot of 924S's are
raced. Some Brittish racers will be over in Holland next week for
competition. I can ask around if you like. What is allowed in your type of
racing? I use a Supercharger of Knoxville intercooler kit in my '83 944
track car and with 250 hp in a low weight car, performance is pretty good.
E-mail me directly if you want to exchange experiences.

Subject: 1988 924S development advice needed

Thus far, I've lowered the car to the extent of the M030 suspension
adjustments, keeping the car level, and added a 28mm Weltmeister bar with
adjustable drop links tuned to the soft ends of the bar.  Feels about like
a 26mm bar at this level.  I'm running KONI sport yellows and the car is
very well balanced, but feels underpowered and lacking brakes.  Still, I'm
faster than every 944 and 924S I've met at the track thus far.  Still,
people who know how to go faster than me are out there in droves, so any
other simple, legal, and effective performance tips would be welcome.
I already know that most work needs to go into the nut behind the wheel,
but I'm looking to max out my metallic outer self as well...  I missed the
Porsche Parade, but the SCCA Nationals are just around the corner, and I'd
like to dial in the car ASAP.
Thanks very much in advance,
Rich Fletcher
