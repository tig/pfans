All,

It just hit me, so here goes:  Ram air and reduced resistance in the intake
would not INCREASE horspower, but would IMPROVE it.  The power is limited by
the max boost pressure which is limited by the waste gate.  What the reduced
resistance in the intake would do is let your boost pressure climb faster.  

As your turbo starts to spool up, the pressure before (up stream) the turbo
drops due to the vacuum created by the turbo compressor.  Decreasing the
restrictions upstream of the turbo will decrease the amount of pressure drop
(i.e., the pressure directly before the compressor will be slightly higher
than with a more restrictive intake).  The greater the pressure upstream of
the turbo, the greater the pressure downstream of the turbo.  After 3 yrs out
of college, I don't remember the equation for the compressor section, but if
anyone really wants it, I can get it in a week or so when I get back to the
states.  

What this all means is that your turbocharger will produce the max boost
alowable by the wastegate both earlier and will not have to spin as fast to
produce this max pressure.  

This effect should be increased by a ram-air setup.  The problem with the
ram-air on our stock cars is the Air Flow Meter.   Due to the turbulance
induced pressure fluctuations  caused by the ram-air, the the DME is not
getting accurate airflow info.  I think this might be solved by a Mass Flow
Meter, which is FAR more accurate than the spring-loaded barn door we have.

When I installed the cone filter on my 951 (it's bigger than the one that
comes w/ the mass flow sensor) I thought it felt like the turbo spooled up
just a hair faster.  I am hesitant to say this, because just the temp
difference makes such a difference in power, but I thought it spooled up
faster at the time.  I plan on making a couple of more changes to the intake
if I can get hold of a used turbo to flow meter boot (see my other post)
which would get rid of that 110 degree bend in that boot, and give me cold
air agian.  By the way, when I put the cone filter on, it felt like it
spooled faster, and I noticed no real change in power.  So I went from cold
air induction, to hot air from the radiator and intercooler, and lost no
power.  I'm hopeing on about 10hp back when I get cold air.
