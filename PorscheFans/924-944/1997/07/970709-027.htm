Most local windshield replacement places can order a new windshield for
you and install it.  I live in Cambridge, Ohio (a city of 13,000) and
Townsend Glass had a new one installed for me within a week.  So finding
one should not be a problem.

When I bought my 924S from my dad, it had a large spider crack in the
windshield on the drivers side.  After I drove it home from Florida, I
called to find out how to get it replaced.  The guy said no problem,
will probably run you about $1400 or $1500!!  Whoa!!!!  Sticker shock. 
Called my insurance company and told them that a rock kicked up from the
interstate (which was the truth) and broke the windshield.  They said no
problem, its a free replacement!  YEAH!!  So I had mine replace at NO
COST to me.

The only catch to this story is that you have to have comprehensive
coverage.  If you have that...you stand a pretty fair chance that your
windshield replacement will be a freebie.  Best of Luck

Regards, Rick
