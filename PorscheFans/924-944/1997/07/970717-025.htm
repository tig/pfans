Hello, this is my first time posting anything on this board. I purchased a
1987 944s special edition three months ago from a neighbor that burned out
the clutch and didnt have the cash to replace it. O stole the car ( or so I
thought for $1000 ), well $4500 later, it is still a problem. I finally found
a good mechanic ( michaelangelo motorsports ) in Irvine, Ca. they work almost
exclusively on Porsche cars and race prep. I have found over the last four
days with them, that 1/2 of the work I paid for was never done, and the other
1/2 ws done poorly. The car was also damaged by my first "german autohaus"
(the hood was dented in three palces from closing the hood with tools inside
it.) The moral of this story is, no matter how much I love this car, its my
scond water cooled Porsche, unless you have a great mechanic, you might as
well go buy a new (or newer) Porsche 911. Because the repair and maintanance
will kill the enjoyment.
P.S Car is almost done, it is looking pretty good, it is definately for sale.
Write me for specs if interested.
