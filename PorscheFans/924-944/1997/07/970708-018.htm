	My 87 944s makes a sound much as you describe as I accelerate through
3100-3200 rpm (no sound if I am just cruising at that level).  As to this
one, there have been a couple of posts that suggest heat shield rattle, but
you seem to have rejected that notion. If you find it, I would love to hear
the solution.  I detect absolutely no effect on performance and agree that
it seems to be more apparent once the engine is warm.

	As for the low rpm noise when the engine is "lugging" along at 1100--1200,
you might check the air flow meter assembly.  At least in the 16v model,
there are three nuts that hold the assembly and I found that if there was
not a proper amount of play in these, they would rattle at rough idle. 
They appear to have rubber bushings under the nuts and, I assume, the
damping effect is best achieved with a certain looseness.
