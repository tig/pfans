This is the first time I have had to write to the list for help, but this
one has me stumped. I have a coolant leak from the front of the engine! Now
of course everybody says water pump; however, the water pump is dry as far
as I can tell. Coolant is on several of the hoses and parts on the front of
the engine outside the timing cover case and as high as the air cleaner
box. The inside of the timing cover case is dry above the water pump;
however, when I loosened the bolts to remove the timing cover case, about 2
cups of coolant poured out. After a cooling system pressure test, I could
see no wetness around the water pump but coolant was pouring from the
bottom of the timing cover case. Am I missing something or should I just go
ahead and replace the water pump? I had no leaks at all one day and a major
drain the next.
