Here's a repost of a message that went out at the time the server dumped. I
got few responces and it took me a while to realize what the problem was and
t hat I had to resubscribe. I've also waited for the list to build back up
from the 200 or so I noticed were on the list last week.

Message:
I just replaced a poorly functioning Blaupunkt in my 88 NA with a Pioneer
"Super
Tuner".  I live on the FM fringe and the car stereo shop said this model had
the best tuner for pulling in distant stations. It is much better but I still
get unsatisfactory distance reception compared to the stock radios in our two
family Volvos.  

Do I have an antenna problem (it's a in-windshield antenna) or do I have an
unfair comparison problem (because Volvo might be using some really high end
radio)?

1. Is the standard 88 944NA windshield antenna adequate?
2. will a mast antenna provide much better distance reception? 
3. where does a mast fit best in/on the car? 
4. there is what seemed to be a dead ended power lead taped to the antenna
cable so I'd assumed it was there to accomodate a power antenna - if not,
what do I do with it, 
5. how much of an installation job is a mast (or power mast) antenna? 
6. where lies the greatest risk; an experienced 944 mechanic (or body shop)
who knows the 944 body panels but doesn't do many antennas, or the stereo
shop
who must do a number of antennas but doesn't know 944s?
7. are their any antenna's or other electronic devises that can boost FM
signal, how do I find them and where do they get wired in?
8. any other suggestions?
