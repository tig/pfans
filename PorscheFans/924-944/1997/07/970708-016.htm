Hello fellow porshe fans

I recently acquired a '87 924S.  Great car to drive, definitely a car that tempts you..... However my power window
failed this weekend (in the down position of course).  The Haynes manual is unhelpful but I pulled off the door trim and
took a look.  It's difficult to describe but I think the problem is this - The actuating arm on the quadrant gear does not
make proper contact with the end of one of the "sissor arm" part of the regulator and slides under when the motor
attempts to drive up the windows.  I believe that the actuator should push on this sissor arm.  The sissor arm appears
to be bent slightly outwards allowing the actuating part to slide under.  A curious arrangement  I presume is some sort
of torque limiter safety feature.  I don;t think that the window mechanism is too stiff, it's certainly not seized as I can
manually move it.  My question is does anybody out there have any experience in removing, repairing or at worst
replacing this mechanism that may be able to help.

Thanks a lot
