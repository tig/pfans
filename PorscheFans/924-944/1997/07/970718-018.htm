Yes, this is the first time since I've had the car that it has run
correctly.  I did not know it was running badly (coming from a 1985 T/A
background and 1981 Turbo T/A background as well as a Porsche 924S
(1988) ) because it was still faster than anything I've owned before,
and I had not bothered to floor the car until a few weeks ago.  The car
ran pretty darn well except for dying at full throttle, and I've spent
the last weeks spending too much money on mechanics before just doing
the work myself and doing it right.

Now, according to some good friends of mine (Porsche and race mechanics
40+ years), the block, pistons and heads on this car are not designed to
run at 300hp.  If you run at these levels you'll get increased ring
wear, blown head gasket, burned pistons, holes in the block
(eventually).  You can't change the laws of physics (yet).  We are
looking at cars originally designed in '77 or so (the fact that they are
still great cars is a tribute to the original designers), and they are
getting a bit long in the tooth.  If you want 300hp stock go buy a V-8
Firebird.  The grip will be better, the engine will last longer (at that
HP rating), the trannys will be bulletproof. 
You will never make the 944 a "modern" car. Everything ages, sometimes
well, sometimes badly, unfortunately this design is aging (not as badly
as the Mir), and like upgrading from a CBR600 to a bigger displacement
machine, if the design can't fulfill your needs you need to get
something else. The new Corvette, for all the fun we can have with
plastic car jokes, is beautiful and looks very impressive.  The next
year Firebirds will have all aluminum 300+ HP stock engines...  The
world has caught up to us, but can't repalce us.
