Hello Porschefans,
I am having a problem with my power locks, it's my alarm
that is going off spontaneously during heavy rainfall.
I just got the car and it happened to me a couple of
times and this is very annoying, certainly when you are in bed
and in the middle of the night you hear your car's alarm going
off and it's only the rain that is causing it, not someone
trying to get away with my car !
My car is a black 944 from 87, it has been imported from the us
in 92, it is an american version and the alarm maybe is to.
The alarm is a Boss with a red, green and a blue button.
I have no idea what type it is as I didn't get any documentation 
with it. Does anybody have an idea what could be causing this 
and what I can do to fix this ? I thought maybe it is that water
is getting in the door handles and causing the alarm to go off, it
might be mistaking the water for a key or something.
Any help will be appreciated !

Thanks,

Gerco Marsch   Holland
