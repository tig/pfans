>I took one of the V6 Camaros out for a test a few weeks ago.. The shifte=
r
is so poorly positioned my elbow hit the seat when shifting. It was about=
 4
inches back of where it should be. I can't imagine trying to shift from 1=
st
to 2nd in a hurry. I also tried last years Z28. The shifter was better bu=
t
like your experience in the Trans Am I found the back end too wiggly for
comfort. I wouldn't want to hit a bump on a corner.

The GM "sport" cars all have a Chevy feel to them including the Corvettes=
=2E =

I have not driven the new Vette but the mags are less than enthusiastic
about the handling.  For those of us who are Turbo S challenged, try
upgrading to 250 lb front springs.  The ride is not too harsh and I swear=

this is how the factory should of shipped all the 944s.  Either M30 or
yellow adjustable Konis, 250 lb springs and Welt or Cup sway bars and GM
has never come close to this feel.

BTW, the small block Chevy is the same design that they have used since t=
he
'50s.  The 265, 283, 327, 307, 305 and 350 are all the same basic block. =

The bottom end of the 944 block is beefer than that of the GM small block=
s.
 I suspect Porsche cut a 928 engine in half, kept the massive bottom end
and the 924/944 was born.  The Porsche block can take 300 plus hp and run=

great for longer than most all stock GM products.  Out limiting factor is=

the Audi transaxle which is rated for only 400 hp.  The factory knew the
enthusiasts would be find ways to crank out more power and speed so the
entire car was designed with that in mind.  =


On a side note, now that I have some driving time on the 2.9 stroker, I c=
an
give an impression.  Driveability is the best way to describe it for stre=
et
driving.  It has the low end grunt that makes the S2 a great street machi=
ne
and the explosive turbo top end.  Even with all the R&D problems, it was
worth it.  A few more bugs to stomp and it will be ready for the August
auto-x.  =
