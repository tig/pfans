With all due respect to Hansman, I want to tell you guys a little story
about Superchips.  Way back in my darker days of owning a Talon, I belonged
to (and still belong to) the Talon Digest.  The Talon Digest members tend
to be very computer literate and very smart when it comes to modifying
their cars.  To give you an idea of how much they like to modify their
cars, about 90% of our digest would have a 2.8L stroker motor if they
owned these cars (and if the price for upgrades were the same as the
Talon).  But, these guys tend to be poorer than the general p-folk,
so they tend to be very skeptical of claims of performance.  One such
member (who is not at all poor BTW) is Todd Day who runs the Talon Digest.

He works for a large firm and his position is such that he has acquired
through school, etc. the ability to dump ECU codes and to check for
validity of aftermarket chip manufacturers.  One such chip which was checked
was a Superchips chip.  The factory ECU dump and the aftermarket ECU dump
were identical.  The package from Superchips came with a bleeder valve 
set to 14psi.  HKS's documentation says that 14psi was a safe level to
install an EVC (Electronic boost controller) so it was common knowledge
that 14psi could be had without aftermarket ECU mods/fuel mods/intake mods.

When Peter Wales (owner of Superchips) was asked on the list about his
company's "scam", he replied back with an excuse, which was almost valid.
He stated that the US$249 charge was for R&D and the "Superchips" sticker
they placed on the main ECU chip was there for identification and advertising.

When you put this puzzle together, you realize that this prick sold many
customers a $10 bleeder valve and a $0.30 sticker for US$249 and then had
the gaul to go on the same list and tell the potential customers that they
were paying for their R&D.  What R&D?  HKS had already told the world
in their catalogue that 14psi was safe without any other mods besides a 
bleeder valve.

With the APE chips, a list member has proven that the code is different,
and with the turbo cup chips, I've seen that the code is different.  I
should mention here that I have *NOT* dumped the code for a Superchips
chip, but in this day and age of competitiveness, a scammer is not 
someone I would consider doing business with.

Here is Todd Day's quote from the Talon Digest:
>Remeber that even the president of SuperChips admitted ON THIS DIGEST
>that they pulled this very same boost bleeder scam.  SuperChips discontinued
>this practice - however, it seems that others are still playing the
>same games.

Make what you want of this and I know that Hansman is very happy with his
results, but how do you know that you aren't just using a bleeder valve
with no additional tuning or anything?  You may have just bought a very
expensive sticker or perhaps a very expensive rev-limit & boost limit raiser.
