Sorry, but I have to laugh (or cry, but laughing is easier).

Just because you're buying a car with low miles doesn't mean
it's new, or even in good condition. An 86 car is now 11 years
old. That means that all the seals, rubber, and moving parts
have been sitting around for a LONG time. Those parts have a
tendancy to dry out, and won't last long once the car starts
getting driven.

I'm not surprised. Again, we're talking about an 11 year old car. The
rubber center in the clutch will degrade over time and you got to buy
the new one. Same with the timing belts.  At least you were smart
enough to change them. I know people who said, "no, there are only 30K
miles on the car, the manual says I can wait until 60K." When the belt
breaks 5K later, what do you tell them?

Just because the parts were good when the car was tested doesn't
mean they will last a long time. How long do you expect things 
to last? I mean, seals are not going to seal forever. They will
need replacement. If your water pump is 10 years old, it's on
borrowed time, no doubt about it.

My best advice when buying a car is service records. If you have
proof that the car you are going to purchase has recently had
the clutch / water pump / timing belts / oil cooler seals / whatever
recently done, you probably won't have to do that in the immediate
future. If not, then be prepared!

> Go figure!

That's the attitude!

Another option is to learn to work on the car yourself. It's not for
everyone, but this is not rocket science. You can do a lot of things
yourself, and save big $$. When people ask me what it takes to own
a Porsche, I say either a lot of $$$, or a lot of time. Things are
goign to go wrong, don't kid yourself. However, I can replace a clutch
for $500 and some hours (Ok, a lot of hours), or you can get a clutch
replaced for $2000. You decide.

It's all worth when you get on the track and put the car through it's
paces. That's what these cars were built for. You will be rewarded when
you exit a turn under full throttle, the power pushing you right to the
edge, while you keep the car balanced with steering.  Then rocket down
the straight to the next turn, where you brake, turn in, and do it all
over again.
