I am about to have a better alarm fitted to my '92 968.  At the moment it 
has the factory alarm fitted at the moment with the little flashing LEDs
in the door locking pushes.

I would like to keep these lights functioning but apparently they are 
not compatible with any other makes of alarm.  I am told that they 
are not 12v so your can't just connect them to a standard alram output 
and also the flashing is controlled by the alarm circuitry so even if 
you could wire them to the new alarm they wouldn't flash!  You also 
cannot set the new alarm to activate the Porsche alarm due to the 
switch being next to the drivers door lock.

Does anyone know a fix for this problem OR does anyone know what the 
voltage rating is for the LEDs so that I can work out the correct 
resistor to put in the circuit and maybe get the alarm installer to 
connect them to the new alarm.

Any help would be appreciated.
