     My 86 951 also has this "judder" on hard acceleration. Its pretty 
     minor. I've always attributed it to the normal engine vibrations being 
     conducted into the body when the motor mount becomes compressed (and 
     effectively solid) under the load of acceleration. In other words, 
     power on, motor twists compressing mounts, mounts no longer dampen 
     vibration, judder happens. 
     
     This is, of course, a different judder than the clutch judder that 
     spawned this thread. If you get a judder upon clutch engagement, then 
     you either have an unevenly worn flywheel, pressure, plate or clutch 
     disk, or possibly oil (or coolant from a leaking heater control valve) 
     on your clutch disk, or possibly you have a failing rubber center on 
     your clutch disk. Of course, if you have a rubber centered clutch 
     disk, you will also be lacking somewhat in power. This is because the 
     car is not a turbo. (weak attempt at dry humor). 
     
     BELTS:
     
     I forget who posted this but.. Belt whine means the belts are 
     overtightened. Period. If they slap the covers they are loose. The 
     tech who told you your belts were whining because they were loose was 
     wrong. Maybe one belt was tight and the others were loose. Maybe 
     another tech did the work and this one just told you the belts were 
     loose so you would feel like you got your money's worth. Or perhaps if 
     he admitted that they were still overtightened after the initial 
     1500-2000 mile "stretch period" you might ask "well, why the hell were 
     they so overtightened in the first place?????" It could be any of 
     these things.
     
     
     I hope some of this helps,
