I have a new (to me) 88 944T and I'm just learning about the 
car.  I have a bunch of ??s.  Feel free to ignore or answer at 
your leisure :-)

NOTE:  I haven't received a digest since the 5th and the list 
administrator is on vacation thru the 14th so direct replies 
would be greatly appreciated for the time being.

I wonder if anyone knows what the rough MSRP would have been 
for my car?  I don't have a clue.

1988 944 Turbo
power leather sport seats (Recaro ?), Reno radio

Rough current value in CA.  I've heard various values from 
11-14k US.  I got it for a bit less than that so I'm wondering 
just how good a deal I did get.

78k, no air bags (no accident damage found, maybe stolen?).
cherry condition, black on black, APE Stage II, new belts and 
brand new exhaust,cat (stainless?), about 50% Dunlop SP tires.

Also, the crossmember that goes across the engine at the top of 
the engine is a rectangular cross section gold-colored bar with 
a WeltMeister sticker on it.

Is this actually a WeltMeister aftermarket component?  Does the 
original car have a member here that this replaced?

NOTE:  Thanks for all who responded to my request to id the 
chips I found in my glovebox.  Current status is unknown as the 
two chips (OEM) are both 24 pin DIPs while APE says this is 
incorrect for my car implying that either my car was 
manufactured sometime in 87 or is grey market?

Anyplace that spells out the actual date of manufacture on the 
car?

I have yet to pull up the carpet and open the boxes as I want 
to reroute some seriously hacked stereo cables at the same 
time.  It seems the previous owner bought floor mats just so he 
wouldn't have to route any cables.  Drop cable, cover with mat, 
done!

Steering ??.  Previous owner mounted 225-55-16s all around.  It 
seems to me like the steering is heavy.  How much impact would 
changing to the proper 205-50-16s in the front have?


Wheels.  I have the phone dial wheels and one of the front 
16x7J units has a chunk out of the rim a little too near the 
tire seal area for my taste even if the shop calls it okay.  
I'm a little overwhelmed by the vast array of offset 
/backspacing data in the FAQ.

Are all the phone dial wheels the same or do I need to worry 
about checking this before buying?  Anyone have a source for 
used wheels?  I've checked 944 Ecology's listing w/o a hit.

Next ?, brakes.  On light application, they squeak like crazy.  
Shop says that this is because asbestos pads aren't available 
anymore.  They also told me I would need to replace my front 
rotors during the next brake job.
1) Is this normal for 78k. (worn rotors)
2) Would drilled rotors help with the squeak problem?  
3) Failing that, would hacksawing a diagonal into the new pads 
help (that's what I've done on my motorcycles).

Clutch.  Shift, especially into reverse, is not difficult but 
is not smooth.  Shop reports the clutch wear is okay and that, 
IF I WANTED, they could bleed the clutch at the next tuneup.  
They seem much less concerned about it than I am. 
Is this a problem which should receive immediate attention?

I'm sure I'll think of plenty of other ??s but that's it for 
now as I don't want to put you all to sleep. 

Thanks in advance for anyone who read this far.
