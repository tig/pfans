All depends on the batch that got delivered to the underground tank that
week.  Just because it's a Amoco, and Amoco is on the side of the tanker,
means that it's the same exact refinment everytime.

Yes, the difference is one.  :)  couldn't resist.

I would look around and find 92 or 93 else where.  Do you have a Shell near
you?  They have 93 in my area, Dallas, TX.

I would be a little leary about additives to boost octane unless you have
some real good trusting reports that backup a certain brand.

If you can, go to the public library and look up some old Consumer Reports.
 They did a deal on Gasoline and octanes and which rated better.  Been to
long, I can't remember the brand/octane for hte buck ratings anymore.
