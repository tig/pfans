There are two big fans that are put right up in front of the nose of
the car and are set to high before the runs are done.  The IC pipe that
leaves the IC is still warmer than when you drive it down the street,
so the dyno power is actually lower than what you would see on the street,
but it is the standard way to test turbocharged cars.  Some tuner shops
run cold water over the IC during the run, that is kind of cheating to me.
