I have contemplated the A arm problem, I don't yet have a problem
though. I don't see why a good engineering shop couldn't replicate some
from   your original cast ones. You could have some bespoke FABCAR style
arms for a fraction of the price. You could also have them made from
alloy or steel.

well after replacing my tie rod end, the whell still shook so i went to
my local firestone and they let me use the lift fr a few minutes. the
dealership forgot to mention that the ball joint was bad as well.
(wonder if there is any way, well never mind)  i am now stuck having to
replace the lower control arm.  i have contemplated the FABCAR arms as i
one day hope to track the car and drive one of the others daily. however
they are mighty expensive.  while looking through some parts stuff on
the net it appears that a 968 has the same lower arms. at any rate i
guess my question is what are my replacement options?  and what else
should i do while i am replacing it?  does anyone have one (right side)
for sale? and finally how hard is replacing it going to be? seems pretty
straight forward but you never know i guess.

TIA,
matt
