Agh. I replaced my rear speakers today. Those of you who have done it
probably know what I mean when I say: NEVER AGAIN! Scraped knuckles from
trying to get the screws in behind the quarter panels (and finding the right
hole!) and greasy arms from picking up those #%#& white plastic spacers that
kept falling through the speaker hole. Some never to be found again, some
retrieved by putting my arms through the grille hole and fumbling blindly.
Oh well.. The result was very good anyway. Even though I only put three of
the four screws back in.. :) I didn't remove the window, so I there was no
way I could get that last screw in.

But still, 4x6" speakers.. 4x6"? I'm not really a stereo freak, but I need
more. I guess the easiest/best/only way is to take a big bite out of the
already cramped hatch compartment, and put a bass box in there..
Unfortunately, I don't know anything about this, and considering the general
un-generality of our cars, I guess there are some special considerations to
consider when building it? One guy mentioned he had the measurements for a
box to fit a Rockford Fosgate element. Are you reading this? I'd like any
measurements and hints and suggestions any of you might have. I'm not out to
win any contests, so I'd like to keep things at a manageable (for my wallet)
price level.
