I Just thought I would let the list know that the mysterious power loss
that has been doggin' me for over a year has been diagnosed, and all it
took was a little confidence from a friend and fellow list member Dorin
Mcintosh,

After alot of coaxing a reluctand Dorin allowed me to put my computer in
his car, I didn't put his in mine for fear it might also self destruct.

Low and behold his car had the exact same sympoms as mine, The DME is
SCREWED! 

1. Please forward me and reasonable prices for part number #944.618.111.01
2. Any ideas what caused this? Will it happen to the next unit or was it
just old age?
3. The car is able to perform all functions except for full throttle
5000rpm+ acceleration, could PCNA Reno possible fix it?

Thanks for everything,

Anthony
