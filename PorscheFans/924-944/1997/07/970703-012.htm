Yes, almost all 944's came with tilt up/removable sunroofs.  There should
be a zippered storage bag for the roof somewhere in the back of the
car.

Again, yes, you have a normal experience here.  The A/C system is
designed to maintain a preset (by means of the temp knob) interior
temperature, which will result in the cycling you are experiencing.

I can't speak to speeds for the BMW, but there appears to be a couple of
factors present here...The BMW is a 6 cylinder engine, and you stated
that you have replaced the engine management chip, both are factors
that could push the BMW into an apparent higher performance bracket.  If
I remember correctly, quoted 0-60 times were in the low 8's, but this is
usually conservative and varies greatly by driver.  In any event, 0-60
times are not really what Porsches are all about...American muscle cars
seem to want to corner that particular market.

You covered two of the three options.  The third is to have the wheels
refinished.  Personally, I would avoid chroming, as the chroming process
seems to end up flaking off after long term ownership, and isn't really
compatible with aluminum wheels.  If I can find it, there was an article in
Panorama (PCA magazine) some years back about DIY refinishing.  If
that is beyond what you want to attempt, I suggest Robert W. Wood in
LA area, also listed as Wheel Techniques.  He does most of the work for
concours winning cars.  He has trade policy, with your wheels as core
for his already refinished wheels in stock...reduces your downtime.

It appears you answered your own question.  In my experience, the 944
has a very linear throttle response, so compared to your BMW, you may
just need to have more initial tip-in.

>	* Finally, I'm looking for a good Porsche mechanic is South Orange
>County CA. Anybody know of one? 

Sorry, can't help here, I'm from IA.

Best of luck with your newfound love.  I've never regretted mine for a
single day.  FYI, check your maint. records and determine if the previous
owner had timing and balance shaft belts replaced.  Porsche
recommends every 45K, but most wisdom says every 30K (especially
for timing belts) to be safe and avoid much more expensive problems. 
Also, if water pump has not been changed, that is the only other really
weak area.
