     Last week on a 300 mile trip I got caught in 2 hours of stop-go 
     traffic on the motorway (freeway).  The kind of jam where you move 2 
     car lengths, then stop for a minute, then move a few yards again, 
     stop, etc.  To make it worse, it was really hot and humid.
     
     My clutch did not like this treatment, and after a few minutes started 
     to judder each time I pulled away.  After an hour the car was barely 
     drivable, shaking violently each time I let up the clutch (I was 
     putting the car in neutral each time I stopped, by the way, not riding 
     the clutch).
     
     When I got clear of the jam, and cruised normally for half an hour, 
     things returned more or less to normal, with just a slight judder in 
     reverse when I put the car in the garage.  Next day, with everything 
     cold, there was no trace of judder, and on my usual 17 mile trip to 
     work everything was fine.
     
     Incidentally, I checked the wear on my clutch by measuring the 
     clearance on the operating lever, and this suggests that it's about 
     one third worn.
     
     Does anyone on the List have experience of this problem, and its cure?
     
     TIA
