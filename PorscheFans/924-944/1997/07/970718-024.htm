From excellence, 1996: page 124
....Still, the Porsche water pumper never rose above mid-pack in a V-8
powered field where it gave away 140hp to the Pontiacs...  
....I don't know that I'm going to run the 968 any longer...  I got some
experience and now I'm just tired of getting my butt kicked...

This is experience from GS class racing, IMSA with the latest and
perhaps greatest of the 944 line.

As I recall, the old Cobras that Peter Brock and Shelby ran handled
rather badly (anyone know the F/R weight distribution of a big-block
Cobra) but they won (sometimes) because the engine could pick that
little car up and just throw it down the straights.  Handling is a good
thing, but cubic inches are really hard to beat (depends on the track).
The evolution of the Firebird has been uneven, but the newest iteration
of those machines are good quality fast cars.  Bye the way, the latest
stock closed cockpit Vipers are apparently more than a match for the
stock Twin-Turbo Porsches on the test track.  I think there is a review
in R&T or something recently, NSX vs 'Vette, vs Porsche vs Viper.  The
Porsche won overall, but gave up handling and top end to the Viper...  I
think it won because the reviewers liked the yellow calipers or
something.

I'm not really convinced the cooling system on my 86 951 is that great
either.  It never overheats, but in 90+ degree temps it really doesn't
seem to have much in reserve either.  I recently had it flushed and
filled, but with the A/C on & both fans pulling good air, it sits right
at the last peg before the needle goes red and doesn't want to come
down.  Of course, I've heard that with Ferrarri and some other sports
cars the A/C is even worse.  Going to try Water-Wetter...

If the cars could handle extended amounts of 300hp reliably then why did
not the factory build them that way?  Heck, if the 944s could handle
300hp stock then why not build the 928GTS as a 600 hp machine and
compete with the F40s and Diablos?  Why doesn't the 3 liter 968 make 350
hp stock?

Bye the way, the front engine rear-tranny first appeared on an old
Bugatti or something, so let us have less talk about people copying what
from whom.  After all, the 911 derives from the kubelwagen or something
that Herr Hitler promised evryone would have in his garage.
