Okay, apparently, at least one person took offense that I sent a request for advice directly to 
Don Istook (and I have apologized ;-)...), so I'll repost to the List, and let anyone who wants 
take a crack at it !! (There can be no prizes for correct answers, because my ISP doesn't support 
Net-Beer)

WARNING: It is in regards to a 'sound', and there is no .WAV file attached !  ;-)

I had previously posted the list regarding a "grating,thrashing, rattling sound" from my car when
hot, and either creeping along in 1st or 2nd at around 1100 rpm and very briefly when
accelerating quickly at around the 3000 rpm range. (Sounds like pinging, doesn't it ?)

I originally thought it was a heat shield thrashing, or an exhaust shield
vibration. (That's exactly what it sounds like, but after going under the car and
moving EVERY shield, no luck.)

SO, I pulled the DME and retarded my timing, changed fuel mix etc, hoping to see a
difference. Only the 'timbre' of the sound changed. It seems to have become more
'muffled'.

I have also tried changing octanes from 101 (using a booster marked 'safe for O2 sensors) down to
87 octane (trying to see a correlation) w/ absolutely no change in the sound. (I normally use 
Chevron 92 octane. Periodic bottles of Techron.)

I only notice this sound when engine is well heated up.
I have replaced my distributor cap and rotor as well as my plugs w/ factory spec parts.
So, does anyone have any suggestions ??

I was also wondering about the possibility of  a.) Exhaust Leak (!)  or b.) Cat
converter starting to break up. (Though it sounds OK when I smack it with a rubber
mallet.) Could it be a bad 02 sensor causing the DME to 'over advance' my timing regardless of
DME setting or octane ???

P.S - Don thinks it's the Cat Con, Anders thinks it may be Piston Slap. I personally think it's 
whatever will be the most expensive to fix !

TIA,
Neil (who definately DOES appreciate the list's advice)
