I have a 1986 944 NA with 45,000 miles which I just got from my uncle.  The
car is perfect except that with the key in the 2nd position there is a sound
coming from what sounds like the base of the windshield (I know that's not
where it's coming from) that makes a noise like a small pump running.  Not
real fast and with a little bit of squeek to it.  It continues even when
started and doesn't change with RPM or speed.  Any time you have the key in a
spot to listen to the radio this little "pump" seems to be running.  It also
has nothing to do with the HVAC system since this has no affect on it.  Any
thoughts?
