garry, the transaxle in my 84 944 just blew up, the pinion gear broke.
The mechanic theorized that the diff bearings became sloppy and allowed
the gears to work their way out of alignment (or something like that).
It cost me $600 CDN for a used transaxle (60,000 miles) and $200 CDN for
the labor to swap it out.
