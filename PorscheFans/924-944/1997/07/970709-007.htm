Hello,

I tried to charge my A/C system last night, and failed miserably!

When I first got the car (april 95) the A/C used to work. Gradually, it
worked less and less until now it doesn't even blow cool air.  After
driving it yesterday (and sweating a lot) I got fustrated and stopped
at the local autoparts place and bought a R 134 A conversion kit.

First I had to find the low pressure valve. Of course, Porsche being
Porsche, it was located in a readily accessable place (not!), right by
the compressor. Since my car is a turbo, that means I had to put the
car up on ramps (not easy to do), and crawl around underneath peering
through various openings in the undertrays. Finally I found the valve,
and I only had to remove 1 hose to access it. I think that's a first!

So, I start the car, turn on the a/c, and see the compressor is
turning. So far so good. I follow the directions on the R 134A kit, and
remove all the old R 12. I then attach the new R134A cylinder to the
low pressure valve, and start the car. When the A/C is turned on, the
compressor should spin and suck the new refrigerant into the system.
Then I should be cool forever.

However, the compressor no longer spins. I seem to recall that these
cars have a switch that prevents the compressor from engaging when
there is no refrigerant. If that's true, then I'm in a catch 22.
I can't fill the system until the compressor turns, and the compressor
won't turn until the system is full!

I have the factory manuals, they are no help at all. According to
the books, I'm supposed to use this gigantic machine to do everything.
That's not going to happen.

So, does anyone know how I can defeat the switch and get the 
compressor to suck the new refrigerant in? Or is there another way?

Many cool thanks!
