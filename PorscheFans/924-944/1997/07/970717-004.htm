How extreme do you want to go? How much money do you want to pour into
your car?
How about a full carbon fibre front including nose, wings, doors & hood.
Carbon dash with no electric ventilation. Gutted interior. Dipped and
stripped chassis.
Magnesium wheels. Titanium springs ( 917 had them ), titanium suspension
arms and light weight hand crafted race dampeners.
Light weight flywheel. Carbon fibre inlet manifold. Hollow torsion bars
or 968/ turbo cup coil overs at the back. Removed fog/driving lights.
Carbon fibre rear spoiler, that rubber one must be heavy. You could even
build a hot 944 from a 924 shell which is (correct me if I'm wrong)
lighter to start with. Metal matrix composite brake rotors. Semi tube
chassis! Hell you could even drill the torsion tube for an extra pound
or so of lightness. You can only go so far before it starts to look like
a DTM/ITC car.

     Weight? this is what I have done mine. I still drive on the street.
     Rear seats... backs gone
     front seats.... Sparco pro 2000
     spare and jack.... gone
     AC..... gone
     power steering.... manual
    These add up to about 220-230 pounds. I have the exact numbers
written
    down at home.
    Next things are:
    Exhaust (currently working on 3.5" system)
    Lexan rear glass
    carbon sunroof panel... manual
    composite rear bumper
    Headlights... Don't really know yet
    composite hood
    Who knows............Any more ideas?
