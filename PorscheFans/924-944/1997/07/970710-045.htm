Hello, I am having a small problem with my heating, the 
air vents in my car keep blowing hot air even though
I turn the temperature way down to minimum. It should give me
air at a temperature around outside temperature then, but 
the temperature sensor does not measure the right temperature
or does not work at all or anything, I don't know maybe someone 
out there knows what I need to change or do about it.

I could turn on the airco of course but it has not been used for
over 6 months the previous owner told me, (I just got the car
for 2 weeks) So He said I'd better check it before using it,
so what should I look for or can I just turn it on and see what
happens ?

I have been looking all over the net for pictures of good looking
Porsche's 944 but have not found so many, only 15 or so, is there
a site somewhere that has a good collection of pics ? I just made
some very nice pics of my own 87 black 944 with 5 spoke wheels, 255, 205
and I am going to put them online very soon, I think I will put them
on a nice domain, www.myPorsche944.com or something ! I am having
a lot of sites with pictures "that people really like to see"
and I have my own internet server so I have plenty of room and traffic
to spare for good pics of 944's.  What I would like to ask is: 
are there more people that would like to have pictures of goodlooking
Porsches online and could help me with this, I could include a story or
specifications or whatever, just tell me what you had in mind and I will
supply the space and the site. I thought it could be a central place
for pictures of Porsches, that would be really great. I think there are
more people like me who really think their car is good looking and want
to show it to other Porsche fans and this could just be the place, how
about it ? I could include all kinds of Porsches.

Oh, one more thing, I need these small buttons that keep the carpet
at the side of the hatch on it's place, the things just below the edge,
anyone has some spares or knows where I can get some ?

Thanks for your attention.
