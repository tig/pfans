Thanks to all that helped me decide whether to adopt an 88 944S. Today I 
brought it home! It's not perfect, but for 140K miles it's extremely clean 
and has good, thorough service records. As expected, it's a delight to drive. 
The engine is tight and smooth as silk. Another 944S has found a loving home.

As for the odd rear-end noises, I've determined they're probably typical for 
a car with this many miles that's been driven in an average manner--sporty, 
not abused. There doesn't seem to be a lot of slop anywhere or nasty clunking 
noises, just some gear whine proportional to rear wheel speed. It could go 
another 100K, or it could fall apart tomorrow. I figure it's like a marriage: 
I'm in it for the long haul, in sickness and in health. 

Next purchase: service manual and owner's manual. I'm still trying to sort 
out the various switchgear and figure out everything, including the "ungo" 
stuff.

A question: I'm getting a warning light (the huuuuge one as well as the 
smaller air bag warning) that I am assuming either means it's time for a 
required air bag check or that there is something wrong with the air bag (no 
damage history with this car that I know of). Suggestions? Or do I have to 
have a dealer do this?

Cheers,
Victoria
