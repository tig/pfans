Safety Equipment:

Jim Pasha's recent Excellence Tech Forum article (August '97 issue) on safety
shows some pictures of the inside of one of my cars ('87 951).  If you look
closely at the photo on page 130, you can see me (my shorts say "Dartmouth,"
which is where I went to college and grad school a long time ago).  Jim took
these photos out in Sacramento at an autocross at Mather Air Force Base.  The
event was a part of the PCA Sacramento Valley Region's annual CRAB weekend,
which is a lot of fun.

Anyway, Jim did not include two key points regarding the mounting of safety
harnesses:

(1)	If you have a late model 944/951 and you use the factory seats, you will
not have a convenient location for mounting the inside lap belts.  On the
early cars, you can use the factory lap belt location, and have your safety
harness and your stock belt share the convenient threaded hole in the tranny
tunnel.  On the later cars, the inside stock seat belt is actually bolted to
the seat.  It is not considered safe to mount a safety harness lap belt to
the seat.  You may be able to get away with this for AX, but I don't think it
would be safe for the street or the track.

	On my car, which is an '87 951, you can see in the photos that I have a pair
of Recaro seats.  I had to solve the lap belt problem when I put these seats
in to even use the stock street belts, since I couldn't attach them to the
seats.  I had to drill a hole in the tranny tunnel to mount an eye bolt (of
course with a back-up washer and lock nut), and mount a street-version seat
belt receptacle.  When I drive on the street, I use this receptacle with the
factory belt system.  On the track and for AX, I clip in the TRW/Sabelt inner
lap belts that you can see in the photos.  The drilling process was pretty
easy, and the holes are not cosmetically unattractive.

(2)	You don't have to drill a hole in the floor for your anti-sub belt.  I
use a ~2-2/12" wide strip of 3/16" thick steel which stretches across the
front seat rail mounting bolts.  Thus, the two bolts which hold down the
front part of the seat rails sandwich this bracket between the car and the
bottom of the rails.  My anti-sub belt is then attached to the middle of this
simple bracket.  The anti-sub belts are positioned correctly to prevent
submarining.  I use slightly longer-than-stock high grade bolts to hold down
the seats and the brackets to accomodate for the thickness of the bracket
(3/16"). 

Of course, before you mount any belts, make sure that you read all
instructions and cautions provided by the manufacturer, and check the rules
in force by your club or sancioning body.

As many of you know, I had a shunt at Laguna in my first 951 (an '89 with 31k
miles).  The belt system and seat worked well, although the Weltmeister
harness bar I had at the time was slightly bent, I was completely uninjured
and unmarked. Wasn't even sore.  I hit a wall at maybe 40 mph almost head on.

Thanks to Jim for keeping the tech articles coming.
