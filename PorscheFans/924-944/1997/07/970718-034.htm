Ok, maybe I was wrong... I've been talking to several of you and
PowerHaus, and maybe the block will take it.  Oh, they also said that
with a bigger oil cooler you can get the temperatures down to where they
should be and make them stay there.  PowerHaus 602-921-0921
Well, we shall see.   Anyone have experience with these guys?  They
seemed very knowledgeable.  Anybody want to give me $10k to test this?
