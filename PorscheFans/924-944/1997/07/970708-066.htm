Rich - No I don't have Paul's limited slip and I'm not sure George has 
anything available except for his current transaxle, which is rebuilt and 
has a limited slip already in it.  If I remember right, he wants $2200 
for it.....George?

Ditto on the peddle travel.  It's long, but they do work.  Earlier this
year I tried the Performance Friction 80 pads for autocrossing.  Don't
waste your time!  For autocrossing the stock pads work great!  Even, Jeff
Reitmeir will back this one up.  Now, with the stock pads in the car, I
lost brakes after about two laps at the Buttonwillow racetrack last year. 
Just ask Rich McClelland how I slowed the car for a hard 90 left hander
after about a 100+mph section, sliding sideways since I had no brakes.  Not
the quickest line, but sure better than trashing a car since that corner
is the only corner where you can hurt the car if you miss it.  I switched
over to the Performance Friction 80's for the time trial event there this
year and didn't have brake problems on a single lap.  So I'm now switching
pads between those two different types of events.  Very little wear on the
rotors or pads with the 80's also.
