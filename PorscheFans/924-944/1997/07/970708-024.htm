Greetings p-nuts,

I am soliciting your  collective help

I am currently writing an article on 944s.  What I need is to assemble an
eclectic group of owners and solicit thoughts, comments, dislikes, likes
about your cars...what I'd like to do is have maybe six to eight (or even
more) of you guys come forward and talk up life with your 944..I'd like to
see all different model 944s covered here -- the more the merrier.  I would
also like to mention names and run a photo or two (all photos will be
returned), so here's your chance at fame and stardom!!! Of course,  if you
wish to remain anonymous, I can certainly do that too -- your input is more
important.

My problem is I don't have much time...If you'd like to be a part of this
(it's all in fun...no muckraking, no political stuff) please Email me or
call ASAP -- the phones are below.  I am putting toegether a generic set of
questions so everybody can respond in a common fashion (plus whatever other
thoughts you have...).  But for right now, please let me know if you're
interested.  This is open to all...Vendors, Racers, etc.

In advance, thank you very much -- this will be fun.

Cheers
Thom Kuby
