My girlfriend's 95 968 Cab (tiptronic) has developed what appears to be a 
transmission leak over the last couple of days.  I'm taking it to the mechanic 
first thing tomorrow, and was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem - 
there's a small puddle of liquid with a reddish-tint (not water) coming from 
somewhere in the rear of the car (the puddle seems to start between the rear 
wheels).

Any ideas on what we can expect?  I haven't heard of too many transmission 
failures with the tiptronic, and the transmission fluid was replaced just over 
a month ago at the 30k service.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this - if you'd like to post to the list, please 
copy replies to me privately via email as well.  Thanks!
