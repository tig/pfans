Did you even read my original post?  I said very, very clearly:

I said you were happy with the results and to make what you want of it;
that means that you and every other list member has the freedom to choose
whatever mods they want.  I really don't care what mods anyone on this
list runs, all I want to see is everyone on this list to be fast with
reliability, which you've seemed to have.  BUT, SuperChips has done
some nasty things in the past and I refuse to deal with them and
wanted it in the open about their previous business practices.  I feel
the list had a right to know.  You live in a free world, make your
own decisions based on what you read and what you feel, I'm not sticking
a gun to your head buddy.

I tested the K&N on the dyno and it did not produce results.  Do you
want me to make up stuff?  K&N's are worth the money if you clean it
even once, it pays for itself, *and* I even gave enough consideration
to K&N to try their cone filter before completey disregarding them
as legit.  Remember, millions of people bought Milli Vanilli
(including myself) records too.

Hansman, read my original post, it gives credit to your car.  If you
don't want to read my factual REAL data obtained on a dyno, press the
delete key, that's what it's there for.  I don't have the same mods as
you, nor am I as fast you, nor do I claim to be the fastest in the world,
all that I am is a guy that wants to build a 944T the proper way and to
share real numbers with a group of people that want to read them, that's
all.

Farzaan.
