Tom:

My 92 968 coupe developed a gas odor in the right rear area several months
ago.  I have paid the dealer to check it out twice and then paid an
independent mechanic about $200 to check it out further.  The latter replaced
the charcoal cannister, which was full of charcoal powder (apparently it
should have been full of pellets) and stank like gasoline.  This did nothing
to help the problem.  I caulked the plastic lid to the fuel pump area on the
passenger side trunk floor, but this did not help either.  I have decided to
wait until a real leak develops, which will make it easier to locate.  As far
as I know, the mechanics have checked every connection in the fuel system,
without finding anything amiss.  The 2nd mechanic used a hydrocarbon meter,
and confirmed that the fumes were present before the car starts up in the
morning.  The nice thing is that the ventilation system removes the odor
immediately on starting the car, so it isn't a very significant problem.

I will check the drain hose which Stuart Trushkowsky mentioned.  Any other
ideas would be appreciated.
