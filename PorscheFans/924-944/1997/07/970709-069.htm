Regarding Jan's original question, the tightly spaced coils on my progressive
rate springs were at the top.

I believe Jan is correct that this orientation results in relatively less
unsprung weight, at least to some extent.  The chassis and everything that
moves with it comprise the sprung weight.  The wheel hub, steering knuckle,
etc. and everything that moves with them comprise the unsprung weight.  The
things that connect the two -- suspension arms, shocks/struts, springs, etc
-- are a combination of sprung and unsprung weight.
  
In its simplest representation, if you take, lets say, a rear half-shaft on a
944, then 50% of its weight will be sprung and 50% will be unsprung.  On
average, half its weight is going up and down with the chassis and half with
the hub assembly.  Similarly,  if you have a constant rate spring with evenly
spaced coils attached to the chassis at one end and the steering knuckle at
the other (as with a 944 strut) such that lower spring perch travel is equal
to wheel travel, then sprung to unsprung weight of the coil will be 50/50.
 However,  the progressive weight springs have 5 or 6 closely wound coils at
one end which compress together under the weight of the car.  These windings
make the spring heavier at one end.  If that heavier end moves more in
conjunction with the chassis (as when installed at the top), it contributes
more to sprung weight.
Conversely, if it moves more in conjunction with wheel travel, it contributes
relatively more to unsprung weight. 

Is it all academic? Probably -- but then again, we drive cars with ALLOY LUG
NUTS!!!
