You can run almost any muffler on a turbo car without really messing it
up, but you can give away throttle response and power by using the wrong
parts.  One of the main reasons why I bought this car was the engineering
that has gone into this beast.  For example, turbo cars require the least
amount of backpressure to produce boost fast and to evacuate the spent
gasses quickly and efficiently;  take a broom and stick it up your exhaust
pipe :)  It goes right through, it's straight through!  Very few factory
cars come with this type of a setup.  The only better muffler is one that
has a larger diameter.  If the SuperTrapp can evacuate more gases over
a unit of time, then it will have less backpressure, which is GOOD
for turbo cars (as for NA cars, there is tuning involved that I have
ZERO experience with).  The first thing to get rid of is the cat and
then you get the cool turbo spinning up noise as well as less backpressure.

My personal advice, stick with the factory muffler or go with an aftermarket
unit that is straight through with no discs, etc.  You should be able to
see from one end to the other.  When I build the race car, I'm gonna
run the stock cat in place, dump the external wastegate to atmosphere,
and run a large pipe at the rear with a Borla XR-1 muffler.

If you want more info on muffler dynamics with turbochargers, I have tons
of info available.
