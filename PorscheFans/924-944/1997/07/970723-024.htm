Pfans,

Thanks again to all that anwered the 924s vs 944 questions.  I went with the 944
frankly because I found a good one (I think) and I love that wheel well in my
mirrors.  (I know - call me superficial).  Anyway I bought a guards red/black
leather 85.5 944 with 93000 miles for $5700.  The car is in great shape, full
records, like new interior and I've looked at so many completely beat on
examples in the last month that I had to buy it or I might kill the next jerk
that showed me their 'pristine' car after driving two hours to see it and find
out it's trashed.

A few questions.  I love the car as it is, but would like some more HP.  I know
it's not a 951, but my motorcycles fulfill that rush for now.  Anyway, some more
snap especially low in the rev range would make it more fun to drive.  Local
shops tell me, throttle body cam, chip, Borla exhaust but leave the stock
headers.   Also will need tires in a couple months I'm sure.  Any advice from
those in the know?  Also,  for Cental Florida people...stay away from Nort's.
They are nice enough guys, but told me this car had a bad cylinder (buyers check
said 40 lbs low on number 4) in order to get me to look at one that they were
selling.  I returned this car and told the owner I didn't want it, he then had a
leak down done at the local Porsche dealer.  It's fine.  I had two other places
check it to, as well as doing a compression check myself (can you really be too
careful?)  Then I went back to Nort's who rechecked it and said it was fine
afterall.  Incompetance or a little sales tactic?  Who knows.

Thanks again for all your help.  Oh, and my two cents.... computers occasionally
screw up...  that's life.  The spamming is irritating, but some people need to
quit drinking so much coffee.   If you can spend two weeks replacing a clutch or
two months doing an engine rebuild, you can show a little patience here don't
you think?  If you want to act like a jerk, buy a corvette, perm your hair, and
have some hair implanted on your chest.  (I've always loved dogging the 'vette
guys)

I do look forward to receiving this list, and the Hansman/Farzaan/951 guys very
nearly had me in one of those.  This is only Porsche number one, maybe next
year.
