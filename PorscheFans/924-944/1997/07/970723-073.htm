Jeff, 
  Had the same problem on my 86 951. It started getting sloppy and then 
it just would not go in to 1st. I took off the leather boot and found
that my shifter lever was worn . It was supposed to be cylindrical but
it was shaped like a bowling pin. One call to Auto Atlanta 770-427-2844,
was all it took. The part's that I needed were: Shifter lever $47.50,
Bushing $8.50. These 2 parts are all you probably need. It took about an
hour to replace. 
The noise in the turbo sounds normal. You should here a whine.
