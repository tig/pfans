Hello everyone,

I hope someone can shed some light on this. After inspecting the rear tyres
on my 83' 944 I noticed that the inside of my passenger side rear tire is
completely gone. The other side is fine. I have done less than 15,000 kms
with those tyres and I haven' been burning rubber.
I went to a tyre shop here in Dubai and I showed them what happened. They
told me that the alignment of the rear tyres if off but I don't understand
how that could be possible. (Anyway mechanics down here usually don't know
their ass from their ellbow). I had a look at the rear end of the car from a
distance and noticed that the drivers side is slightly hanging. I suspect
that the springs might need replacing. Is anyone out there who had this
problem ? Is my car eating the passenger side rear tyre because of worn
springs ???? If yes any idea how much new springs cost ? Also I would like
to know if anyone can tell me how to change them

Thanks a lot in advance

Subject: URGENT!   BALL JOINT/ARM REPLACEMENT!
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     Please help!  I just found out that my right front ball joint has gone 
     to hell.  My shop says they can replace it tomorrow for ~$360 total.  
     The $82 labor doesn't seem excessive, but is $280 a good price to pay 
     for ONE REBUILT ALUMINUM ARM?  My mechanics say that these arms have 
     greasable joints and that they are high-quality rebiulds (all bushings 
     replaced or something), and that they tried the $160 rebuilds before 
     and were disgusted with the quality.  Can I find a better price?  
     Please reply directly to me because my shop will have to order the 
     part soon (TODAY) for it to get fixed tomorrow!  THANKS!!!
     
     Ben
