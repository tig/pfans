Mark,
  For now forget the mass air flow sensor. Go with Superchips Inc. They
send you the chips and a bleeder valve to take the turbo up to 17
lbs.You will need ann aftermarket gauge for boost for this I used
Autometer.
Then You are going to need more fuel. Even though the one chip is for
fuel you still need more!! For this pick up the Bosch rising rate fuel
pressure regulator. By this point you are going to notice a difference
(about 90hp). It would help at this point to have some 100+ octane. Now
you need to help out all the duct work, near the mass air flow sensor.
(I really dont know if this helps but I did it anyway). Smooth all the
edges (this could take a while). Up the plugs to bosch platinum if you
haven't already. With these upgrades alone it should allow you to
dispatch the late gm f body's and the vette's, up to 96 anyway (I havent
really had the chance to run one yet). Not bad for a 4 cylinder.
Note: Superchips tells you to stop at 14lbs. I beleive you can go higher
but if you do use it sparingly.
    Now if these upgrades aren't enough pick up a k27. You will loose
initial throttle response but it will pay for itself in mid the range.
Now all you have to do is convince your wife to test her out. Mine did
once, and refuses to take her out anymore.
