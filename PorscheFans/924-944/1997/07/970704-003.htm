Hi everyone:

Last night, I took delivery of an '86 951 (87k, Arena Red (?), sunroof,
excellent mechanical condition, very few cosmetic flaws) and I am now a 
very happy camper and member of the Porsche family.  ;-)

I wasn't really planning on this purchase, but when I saw it on the lot, saw 
what condition it was in, I had to have it.  "Wo ein Wille ist, findet man
immer einen Weg." ;-)  Maybe it's just my German stubburness that got me
there.  So, finally, when someone asks me whether I as a German in the U.S. 
drive a German car or American car, I can finally answer with a whole hearted
"YES" and big smile on my face.  Ah, yes, I guess that's why I really bought
the car anyways, just to show off -- just kidding ;-).

Wife hasn't yet decided whether she loves or hate it, she'll come around 
eventually.  Then again, maybe I should just get her a Boxster since I don't
fit in it anyways.. ;-)

The local cops have decided that I must be some local college kid zipping
around town, filled up for/from a 4th of July pseudo-related party and I
believe I've gotten stopped at least 4 times now (in 2 hrs driving in town) 
for not making a turn into the closest lane and(!) because "Sir, you also took 
a bit of time when you started after the light had turned green.  Have you had 
anything to drink tonight, Sir?"  Arrgh.  Thank you very much for pointing out 
that I'm having a little bit of trouble with getting used to the wonderful 
clutch in this car ;-).  Boy, relearning driving a manual after 4 years of
automagics, this is not an easy car to (literally) start with.  But that's
okay.  Anything in life worth having doesn't usually come without pain.

So, I guess, I have become a magnet for all sorts of junk now.  But then
again "Was stoert es eine deutsche Eiche, wenn sich ein Schwein dran reibt." 
;-)  Can't wait when I actually will get over for going the speed limit. *sigh*

Anyhow.. my apologies, just had to babble this out to the world. ;-)

Now, everything worked while I was at the dealership yesterday, and then I
go to release the rear hatch and only one side (left) will release, the other
appears to stay locked.  Any clues?  I'll probably stop by at Ed Carroll's 
(Ft.Collins, CO -- excellent guys, no nonsense, no bullshit, down to earth, 
honest, fast and friendly -- no, I don't get paid for saying that; just my 
experience) and have them have a look at it.

Everyone have an absolutely fantastic 4th of July weekend!  
I'm sure I will. ;-)

Best regards,
Chris
