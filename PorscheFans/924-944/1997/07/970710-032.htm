<<It's all worth when you get on the track and put the car through it's
paces. That's what these cars were built for. You will be rewarded when
you exit a turn under full throttle, the power pushing you right to the
edge, while you keep the car balanced with steering. Then rocket down
the straight to the next turn, where you brake, turn in, and do it all
over again.>> Writes Uncle Barry

   Stu and David, glad to see I'm not alone out here! David..the opt for the
968 was probably the best move. I could be driving a new Boxter for the
cabbage I've sunk in the 44.  But...Barry's post sums it up the best with the
above mentioned last paragraph. Nice job, makes me want to leave work early
and fire her up...perhaps a trek up the Henry Hudson Parkway.  Ahhhhhh......
