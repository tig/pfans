Hello:

I have a question/problem that I know a few of you know quite a bit about.
First off the subject is '87 NA 944. I am wanting to get air conditioning
going for the remainder of summer but I haven't the foggiest idea where to
start. A/C systems have always puzzled me and at this point I would like to
learn more about them. 

Upon inpection of misc. wiring and plumbing it seems to be in proper order
except for one thing. On what believe is the low pressure switch, located
drivers side front under headlight bracket and plumbed into a/c line, the PO
has rigged a hard wire between black/red wire and the black wire, ignoring
the two male connectors on low pressure switch completely. Why was this done?
Is there a specific condition that such a quick fix would point to, e.g. bad
compressor ect? Would I do any damage to system by plugging the low pressure
switch back? 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated as this summer is getting rather warm
with black leather.

Alec Miller
