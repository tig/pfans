I took one of the V6 Camaros out for a test a few weeks ago.. The shifter
is so poorly positioned my elbow hit the seat when shifting. It was about 4
inches back of where it should be. I can't imagine trying to shift from 1st
to 2nd in a hurry. I also tried last years Z28. The shifter was better but
like your experience in the Trans Am I found the back end too wiggly for
comfort. I wouldn't want to hit a bump on a corner.
