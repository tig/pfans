Fortunately, air doesn't rush into your airbox at 70mph or 100mph  it would
probably cause havoc with your airflow sensor.  The air intake on our cars is
in the driver side wheel well.

Here are my feelings on a K&N airfilter for turbo charged cars :

It won't improve horsepower.  Even if you didn't have an air-filter, your not
going to get any more horsepower.  The turbo (or KLR) controls the amount of
air being fed to your car, it will acheive it's max boost regardless of what
filter is installed (providing the filter does allow for airflow).

A K&N airfilter might decrease turbo lag.  With non-restricted airflow, the
turbo impeller will be able spool up faster (i.e. the turbo doesn't have to
fight to pull the air through the filter).  However I don't know if anyone has
done any tests to see if their turbos spool up faster with the K&N.
