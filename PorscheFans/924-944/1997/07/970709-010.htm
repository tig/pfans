I second the performance of the Performance Friction PF 80 pads for
heavy duty track use. I used them to race at Lime Rock, and for track
days at Bridgehampton. They work great, last a long time, and didn't 
even destroy my rotors. Of course, they aren't suitable for street
use, so I switch back to MetalMasters for that.
