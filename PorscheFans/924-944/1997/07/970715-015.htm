I had my A/C fixed about 6 weeks ago.  It needed a new condensor ($479
ouch!).  I experience a similar problem but not as bad.  When I'm driving
and push in the clutch and let the engine return to idle, there is
considerable vibration for about 2 seconds and then everything is fine and
the engine idles properly.  It never seems like the engine will stall and
no lights come on though.

Also, ever since I've had the car (3/97 5k miles), there is the same
vibration upon starting the car in the morning.
