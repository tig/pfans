Hello PorscheFans,

	First of all, I would like to thank everyone who contributed
advice to my clickity clunk problem of my '87 951.  I plan to investigate
all of the avenues this weekend. 

	Secondly, I have a few other questions:

	My dash lights are quite dim, even when on their brightest
setting.  I've been told this is normal.  Does anyone know of a way to
brighten them up?

	What is the proper tire pressure.  Tire dealers tell me about
34psi front and rear will suffice.  Porsche recommends 36psi front and
rear (inside of fuel fill door).  What's the best?

	Lastly, my right tail light lens has turned into a fish bowl.  The
lens is separated into 6 square sections (I think).  The bottom left is
the brake light.  That lens fills with water whenever it rains but not
when I wash the car.  It was suggested to me to fill the gap surrounding
this particular square with clear silicone.  I did this but to no avail.
Does anyone else have this same problem?  Any suggestions?

Any information is greatly appreciated...
