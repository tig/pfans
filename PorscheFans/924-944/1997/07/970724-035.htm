Hiya,

I recently bought a 1978 924 porsche that had major clutch problems. I
finally got the clutch rebuilt, everything is new except the bellhousing.
The starter works fine the first time start (when cold) but the sequential
times it stays engaged too long. It appears that the starter is
fairly new, I inspected it when the clutch was apart. Someone suggested
putting shims between the bellhousing and starter, any other suggestions?

I was also wondering if it's the wrong starter? How could I check?

I don't want run the car this way, figuring it could cause damage to the
flywheel or the starter.

This isn't the regular starter action, is it?

Thanks,
Robb...
