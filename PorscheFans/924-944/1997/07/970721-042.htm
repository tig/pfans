Actually the grow up was for the people hasteling you. They should know it
was not your fault, nor was it Matts fault. As to the people cursing you
ect. ignore them they will go away. AS for wasting my time, I CCed both the
911 list and the 944 list so the jerks will know how stupid they are. I also
had many responses that agreed with my post, your response to Matt was
uncalled for, and the people who had the audacity to send those stupid
messages to you are in fact jerks.

Good luck,
