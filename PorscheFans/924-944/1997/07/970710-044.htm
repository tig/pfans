All, 

All this stuff from Farzaan has got me wanting more power the easy way.
 First thing I'm gonna do when I get back to the states is as my
mechanic/buddy how much he'll drain me for a head gasket change.  Then pursue
some more boost.

First big question,  Other than head gasket, what other damage can slightly
overboosting do?  I realize you have to worry about knock.

Second, cycling valve.  How much does a new one cost?  What's the procedure
for drilling it?  And (Farzaan) how are you guys "adjusting" your boost?  

and Third, the banjo bolt.  Are the varios configurations for this bolt
applicable if you have the cycling valve drilled?

PS:  I miss my car very much.  I've been in Panama for a month w/ 8 days to
go.  The only time I drove a car in this time is occasionally a rental
tercel.  I did get to drive the tercel over from Atlantic to Pacific side
over the mountains on a newly blacktoped (actually the only road) VERY wind
road.  I was drooling for the 951.  Credit to the tercel, it did take the
flogging quite well.
