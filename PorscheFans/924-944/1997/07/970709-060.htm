========================================================================
Mike, 
 I had the same problem with my 86 951, I figured it was the altenator.
Just to get to the altenator took 3 hours, it turned out that the
brushes were bad. I purchased a new set for $31.00. They have the volt
reg. attached also. It took 5 minutes to replace but all the turbo
plumbing had to go back in, this took another 3 hrs., everything is
crammed in there! If your mech says 3hrs. total then take him up on it.
You wont be sorry.
