All of the turbos will have some oil present in the high-pressure side of the
intake path, at least if they see much boost. Jim Pasha had an Excellence article
some time ago about it. Yell if you want a copy of it. In small amounts the only
detrimental effect is to reduce intercooler efficiency because of the oil film.
You should probably clean the intercooler. Write back if you want to know how
to do this without removing the intercooler.
