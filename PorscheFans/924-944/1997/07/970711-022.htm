Just replaced the half dead Blaupunkt radio in my 88 NA with a Pioneer "Super
Tuner".  I live on the FM fringe and the car stereo shop said this model had
the best tuner for pulling in distant stations. The Pioneer is much better
the Blaup. but I still get unsatisfactory distance reception compared to the
stock radios in our two Volvos.  

Do I have an antenna problem or do I have an unfair comparison problem
(because Volvo might be using some really high end radio)?

1. Is the standard 88 944NA windshield antenna adequate?
2. will a mast provide better distance reception? 
3. where does a mast fit best in/on the car? 
4. there is what seemed to be a power lead next to the antenna cable so I
assume that it was there to accomodate a power antenna, 
5. how much of an installation job is a mast or power mast antenna? 
6. where lies the greatest risk; an experienced 944 mechanic (or body shop)
who knows the 944 body panels but doesn't do many antennas or the stereo shop
who must do a number of antennas but doesn't know 944s?
7. are their any antenna's or other electronic devises that can boost FM
signal, 
8. any other suggestions?
