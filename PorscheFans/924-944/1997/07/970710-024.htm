The drilled cycling valve is the wastegate bypass.  The wastegate
still controls the opening of the bypass gate.  With a drilled
cycling valve, less pressure gets to the wastegate diaphragm (sp)
and the wastegate stays shut longer, thus creating higher boost,
but the excess pressure that can no longer bleed through the
drilled cycling valve goes to the wastegate and causes it to
open and release the exhaust gases into the bypass pipe (bypassing
the turbine wheel of the turbo).  So, either method you use,
the car is still controlled by the wastegate, so what's the
difference?  A drilled cycling valve technologically speaking
is no better than a $0.20 aquirium valve, whereas the boost bolt
and KLR system is comparable to an extremely high tech boost/fuel
management system with precise controls.

No, no.  The stock turbo could likely produce over 20psi of boost
at 4000rpm, and then it would drop as you see in the torque
charts.  The wastegate is still controlling max boost as it
does in all cars.  BTW - the type of wastegate we have on this
car people would die to have on their japanese turbo cars.  We
pay huge dollars to get HKS external wastegates on our Talons.

The cone K&N may be a different story though.  We'll see how
it does on the dyno, from a pure restriction point of view.
