In a message dated 97-07-08 23:34:11 EDT, you write:

<< Next item is wheel offsets.  I've been told that the widest wheel/tire
 combination possible on a late 944 Turbo is 17x8.5 up front and 17x10 in
 the rear with 255/40R17 and 275/40R17 R1's.
 
 1. Is this information correct?
 2. If so, what are the offsets of the wheels?
 3. How bad does the gearing get affected by this change, can you notice
    the difference?
 4. Does it rub under hard cornerning?

Hi, I''ve got 17 x 8 & 9 Hart C2-Turbo wheels in the standard late offsets
on my 87 944-S,  The tires are Dunlop SP-8000 in the 255/40-17 and
275/40-17 sizes.

I'll tell you that they do not fit without some minor modifications,  I had 
rubbing at the ten oclock and two thirty positions on each side and had 
to bend/grind back the inner lip over 1/8 inch at those positions.  They now
do not rub.  If you go with a custom offset 3pc wheel you could avoid this
problem.

Looking back, it was really no big deal to get them to fit, and it was well 
worth it because they look absolutely awsome on the car.  I wanted some
tires/rims to REALLY FILL OUT the wheel wells - These definitely DO!

Thanks,
