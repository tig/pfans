On the contrary to what some may think, IMHO this list is fairly topical
most of the time. A healthy trading of opinins (with due respect to
persons, but maybe not to opinions...) adds to the fun - no question of
that.

If there really is a problem with the the multitude of postings here,
let's all consider some tips and tricks that are used on other lists:

1. It is not necessary to copy the list on every occasion. I think many
people hit the 'Reply to all' button (or the equivalent) by sheer habit.
It is not always necessary to universally spread all wisdom... A recent
example is Don Istooks private answer, that accidentally revealed an
individuals poor opinion about his fellow list members advice value...
(and I know what this guy's problem is, as I am sure many other know
too...) 

2. Use the concept of 'summarizing'. A question can (and should) be
summarized by the questionaree for the benefit of others who are
interested in the answers. The benefits are that the answers are put
together and contained in one post (ideally) and much easier to store or
print out, and the other is that the list traffic goes down as
respondents know that their pearls of wisdom will, eventually, get
eternal life in the summary... 

A proper hint about the willingness to summarizet could be 'Private
answers please, I'll summarize'. Now, some people ask for private
answers, 'cause they dont want to read the list'... Without an offering
to summarize, this is not either corteous or lessening list
traffic.      

3. There are no such thing as a stupid question. However, there are a
lot of internet resources that can be used before putting a question out
to the list. Reading the FAQ (splendidly edited by Kevin Gross) and
reading your vehicles handbook may always be a good idea before asking
any questions. 

4. Do not get too upset with opinions and their advice. Remember that
advice given on the list is given by individuals with very varying
degree of experience and knowledge. There is bound to be errors, and
confirming advice from the list with other sources of information may
save you from expensive or dangerous mistakes.     

Best regards
