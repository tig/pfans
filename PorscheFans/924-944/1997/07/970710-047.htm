Barry:

I am most certainly NOT an expert in A/C, but I have had good results
with the following experiences.

First of all-STOP RIGHT THERE!!  To the best of my understanding, the
oil in the conventional system (R-12) is a natural kind of oil either
castor or mineral based and NOT compatible with R-134.  You must remove
the compressor and empty it of the existing oil first.  (Look on the
bright side, there's no flushing out or anything such).  Replace the
compressor, then remove and throw away the receiver/dryer.  This removes
the rest of the oil and probably other things that I do not know the
details of.  Finally, I also changed the expansion valve to one that is
calibrated to the different pressures of 134.  I am told that this was
not absolutely necessary, but I did it as the system was no winner with
R-12 and felt that any additional help in terms of efficiency would be a
'good thing'.  
Now your supposed to evacuate the system...but I've never done that with
any one of my cars.  I use a really low budget method that many will
disagree with, but here goes.  I left one of the connections to the
compressor off and began to fill the system with the other valve,
holding the open side of the compressor closed with a finger.  Watch the
open hose for the vapors of the R-134, then close the valve on the can
90%.  Install the hose to the compressor.  Now open the can.  It stops
shortly.  Take a coffee can and MAKING SURE THE R-134 CAN AND VALVE ARE
OPEN, pour warm water over the R-134 can while same is sitting in the
coffee can.  You will hear the gas boiling and moving into the system. 
This method forced the gas into my system and required 3 cans, just like
the R-12.  Try 2 and turn the system on and read the sight glass to be
sure though.  
Mine is an older car and I'm told that the hoses are more porous than
are the late models and will result in the loss of the R-134.  Well, I
finished the project in April and so far, everything's tight, although I
do not use the A/C daily.  Nonetheless, this method resulted in a system
charged by R-134 that works as well as it did on R-12, barring actual
temperature readings, mind you.  I'm very happy with the conversion.

PLEASE be careful if you try this and (with all due respect) do not
blame me if the can blows up the fender of your car!  Done carefully and
slowly this works.  I have never been successful at having any system
draw the charging gas in under its own power.  Obviously I'm doing
something wrong as that is the way it's done, but my workaround is
effective.
