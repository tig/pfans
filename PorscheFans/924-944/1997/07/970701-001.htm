Because of very high oil consumption and a vibration in the clutch after
a club event
I have removed the engine from my 1986 924S.
I am currently taking the engine apart for a rebuild and I have just
removed the
clutch. The rubber damper was ripped in two so I definitely need a new
one,
I am also going to replace all bearings and the flywheel seal. The
question I have is
whether it is really necessary to replace the pressure plate. It seems
to be in good 
condition (100000km=60000miles) and as far as I can see does not really
need to
be replaced. I am also planning to replace the car within a year with a
944S2.
What is the collective wisdom of the net on this?

I am also experiencing a couple of noisy valve lifters, is there anybody
out there who
has good used ones for a reasonable price?

Thanks in advance.

Paul
