The reason you felt these affects were most likely due to the fact that
you changed the wires to something that you "felt" would be better... so
they must be... the ol' placebo affect... and also because you replaced
your old wires with new ones.  Most any new wire will be better than a
used one since nearly all wires deteriorate with time, at least those =
with
a carbon conductor such as Nology, MSD, Moroso, etc, etc.

I urge any interested party to read the technical information on the
Magnecor web site at www.magnecor.com.  There is quite a bit of it.  =
While
this may be self serving information I found it to make perfectly good
sense to me (an engineer).  So much so that I bought a set of their
Competition KV85 wires, which just happen to be used by many racing =
teams.

I guess that's my 2 cents worth.  No connection to Magnecor, just a
satisfied customer who appreciated a great product at a reasonable cost
delivered in two days with excellent customer service.
