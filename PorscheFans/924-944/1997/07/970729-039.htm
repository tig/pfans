Hi Pholks,
I suspect that I have a non-functioning O2 sensor.  My car (951) has been
acting up lately - drives great one day than feels sluggish the next.  I
was just reading the new issue of the Automotion catalog wherein they say,  

"Losing power? We have found that some Porsches are losing 10-20 horsepower
for no obvious reason.  The cause has been traced to failing Lambda
sensors, which pass all the standard tests at the low and mid-range RPMs.
Above 3,500 they begin to malfunction.  Check this out if you are sensing a
power drop." 

There was a recent thread on the use of the Ford Mustang Bosch sensor in
lieu of the big $$$$ Porsche item.  Is this sensor the same as the one on
my 951 (87)?  My local parts guys also carry a generic Bosch sensor (three
wire) which they say should work as well.  What about the connections -
does one need a special connector?   Anybody care to comment.  I noticed
that the 951 has a different part # from the NAs, however, my parts guy
seems to think that they are all the same. Seems a stretch to me.
