 Ben,
   Easy now. All Porsches are excellent cars, it just depends what you
are into. If you are the type of person that can live with 236 hp then
get the 968. If however you are the type of person that is allways
looking for more then pick up a 951. The 951 responds well to tweeking.
The turbo is set at the factory at a little more than half of its
capacity. With a few tweeks here and there you will have 300 ++ hp.
It will top out at well over 165. This same car will allow you to rip
through most of the cars made today going from 0-60. 
As for the 951s allways having problems I can only speak from
experience. It is one of the best made cars on the planet period.
