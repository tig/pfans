Keep in mind that in racing reliable means lasting through one race. Reliable to a drag racer is 1/4 mile between rebuilds.
One of my favorite quotes from Colin Chapman (Lotus guy) was that a propperly engineered race car should fall apart after crossing the finish line. If it lasts longer it is overengineerer for the task at hand and is therefore too heavy.
It would be my guess that the folks on our list that are in a quest for 300hp don't object to the decrease in the service life of there engines.
