Hi Everyone;

   I am about to become the new owner of a
944 and I reallly could use some advice/help
from you more experienced owners on this
great list!
   The car in question is a 1986 Porsche 944
with about 40000miles on the odometer. It has
been owned by a friend, its been well
treated, and it has had all the timing belts
and seals etc. done, as well as a complete
brake job (all done by Porsche$$). I have two
problems/concerns where I am in desperate
need of advice however.

1. This car has basically not been driven in
about two years (basically since my friend
bought her new 993!). I'm wondering if I can
expect any major problems because of this
once I put this car back on the road (seals
drying up, etc.). Note that the engine has
been run at regular intervals. 

2. The other issue is a clutch problem which
makes the car undrivable right now. Last time
the owner went to drive the car, she pressed
the clutch, the pedal went to the floor, and
stayed there. The clutch is currently in an
engaged state, but the pedal does nothing
except stay on the floor. You can pull it
back up by hand, but once it is slightly
pressed, it springs back down. There were no
obvious signs of any leaking under the car,
and the fluid reservoir seems full. Any
ideas?? 

   We intend to get under the car in the next
few days and have a look at what the problem
might be. Does anybody have any
suggestions/recommendations? Slave cylinder,
master cylinder, clutch fork (I hope not!)?
   My intentions are to get it back on the
road, make sure nothing else is obviously
wrong, then basically change ALL the fluids
and start driving the car like it should be.
Any and all information would be much
appreciated; since I get the digest format of
this mailing list, I would appreciate
responses directly to my email address below.
I will summarise as needed.

Thanks very much in advance;
