Bill:  You have an excellent person in your chapter.  He is a PCA club racer
(914), 944TS owner, 914 owner, and all around good guy.  David and Diane
Kimes, 14755 Native Dancer, Morgan Hill, CA  95037.  Home 408-779-5988.  I
hope these numbers are still current.  If not, email me and I'll get new
ones.  Dave is an occassional instructor/teacher at Sears Point and elsewhere
and worth knowing.  Say hi for me.

In PCA driving events (Club Racing classes in brackets), 1983-88 944's are in
P6 [I], 944S [H]and 1989 944's [?]are P7, 1986-88 944Turbos P8 [F], Turbo S's
and 89 Turbos [E] and 944S2's [G]and 968's [F] are P9.  How the cars progress
with mods is a whole other story.

My advice, if you want to be frugal is a 85.5 (later style dash is first
indication) or later 944.  They are generally bullet proof (sometimes
transaxle problems, the usual water pump problems, maybe a motor mount).
 There should be lots around at good prices.  Parts cars are cheap too.
 Turbos can be real good or bad.  I have a 88 TS that has only ever needed a
water pump (and now a power steering hose).  It's been tracked lots.  Others
have head gasket problems (blown), pinion gear problems, etc.  Problem is
usually overexuberance and too much boost.  (I have a hot chip and its caused
me no problems.)  944S's were a 1987 and later phenomena (2.7L).  S2's are
even better (3.0L) but more expensive.  Both can cost more to fix - if the
head is damaged -  than they can be worth.  They are great cars.
