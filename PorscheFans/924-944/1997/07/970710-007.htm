Maybe we are drifting away from 944's a little, but what the heck...

But lets talk strong engines and Porsches a little:

The 904 Carrera GTS had a NA 4 cylinder 1996 cc with 198 HP in 1965, 99
HP/liter. 

A 908 of 1975 had 6 cylinders and a turbo, 516 HP from 2997 cc.

Talkin' BIG engines, Porsche qualify with the 1973 917-30, with 1100
Turbo hp out of 5374 cc and 12 cylinders. Mark Donohue drove it in the
CanAm, and it may be the fastest Porsche, ever.

A 350 CI engine is roughly equivalent to 5534 cc - pretty close to the
Porsche CanAm car. A HP measurement of 442 (times 1.15 to compensate for
transmission and give flywheel HP) may give about 91 HP/liter. If it was
supercharged/turboed to give 6-700 HP, it would still be vastly inferior
to what Porsche did 25 years ago. 

Just to put Porsche technology in its proper place... <grin>
