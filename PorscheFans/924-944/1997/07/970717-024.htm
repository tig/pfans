Hi there:

During the past couple of days, the summer in Colorado has finally reached its 
warmer stages of the year, and today on the way to work I noticed that my '86 
951 was running what I'd consider fairly toastily, meaning: the temp gauge was
up in the upper third past the last white bar by 1-2mm, not yet in the red.
With a/c running, the temp gauge went up by another 1mm.  

All this was at a fairly civilized 75mph on I-25 around 10am'ish, so, temps
must've been 85+F.  I ended up driving around in city traffic without a/c on
and sunroof/windows wide open, worried that it might have otherwise pushed the
engine into the nastier temps.

So, I've been wondering whether that's normal or not.. anyone care to comment?

Cheers,
Chris
