Everyone, 

First the bit of news I have regarding speeding:


Speeds up; deaths down

WASHINGTON — Higher speed limits on the nation's highways have not 
resulted in an increase in traffic fatalities. Nationwide, traffic 
accident deaths actually dropped slightly in 1996 to 41,500 from 41,798 
in 1995, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
data. In December 1995, Congress repealed a 1974 federal law that 
limited speeds on interstates to 55 mph. Since then, a total of 36 
states have raised speed limits or taken steps to raise limits.


Next, I got out of a speeding ticket I received about a month and a half 
ago.

I was driving down the feeder road of our Sam Houston Tollway heading 
toward Pasadena, Texas.  I get a K-band signal on my Escort 5000, but I 
didn't see the cop.  He pulls me over, citing me for 55 in a 45.  He 
also tells me that he clocked me at 64, and another car next to me at 
63.  I am puzzled as to why he told me that.  Anyway, I wait until a 
week after my court date to show up, giving myself time to prepare.

In the courtroom, I realize the cop did NOT put the right state of my 
driver's license on the ticket!  He put it down as Louisiana, not North 
Carolina.  I get up to the judge, and ask for a dismissal, based on that 
information, which he called a 'material defect'.  I paid $20 instead of 
$98(!) and no ticket on my record!

Just thought you guys would like to know.

Michael
