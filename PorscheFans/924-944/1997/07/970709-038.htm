My wife and I live in Manhattan, where a decent parking garage alone runs
about 4 bills a month. We had a 3 series Beamer droptop, which after
insurance, the car payment and the garage...was running about $1,200.00 a
month. (for a car that gets driven once or twice a week...)  Jeeze, for that
kinda dough couldn't I have a Turbo 911?
Anyway, we decided to be prudent, dump the Beamer and get something for cash
that was cheaper, yet still fun...hence the idea of getting a pristine 44 was
born. Well, I found an 86 NA 44 which had 32,000 and was absolutely showroom,
inside and out. I payed $9,500.00 which was probably high, but I was in love.


That was back in December...(... had previously owned a 73- 914 and an 85-
944)
I was running the numbers yesterday wondering what I had sunk into the new
one and was blown away. I did a clutch, alt, window regs on both sides, water
pump, timing belt/tensioners/ hoses, belts....a bunch of aftermarket toys,
rear speakers...
anyway...turns out I've got about $16, 500.00 into her, total. 
She's perfect in every way now, but if I needed or wanted to sell her, I'd
lose my ass.

I guess, I just have to figure that this is going to be my ride for a
while..which suits me fine. What I'm trying to say here is that I've read
many posts from people looking to buy 44's. Be prepared to sink some
dough...it's a reality. And...don't go overboard unless you're gunna keep her
around a while.

(God, I'm glad my wife has no idea about this web-page!)
