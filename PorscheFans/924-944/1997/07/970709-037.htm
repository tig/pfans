The DME chip has been replaced with an aftermarket unit as all Stage II
cars have.  The car's boost changes based on conditions so you can see
the difference between 14 and 15psi.  I videotaped the boost gauge on
each run so we could analyse the video carefully after.

A turbo car does not require a ram-air setup.  Some of the tuners have
even said the factory air flow meter cannot deal with high pressure
air being fed into it (true or not, I don't know).  Whatever the case,
the main point of testing a K&N is the airflow through the filter.
The K&N had the same setup as the factory filter and produced zero gain,
so ram air or not, it went through the same test and did not produce
any results.

Going after small aspects like that will cost you a fortune.  I'd
rather turn the boost up 1/2 lb than to install an expensive cam
for example, but then, that's just me.
