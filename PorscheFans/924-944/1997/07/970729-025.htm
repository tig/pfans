Russ,

Insurance companies cannot legally charge you a higher premium for
a comprehensive claims. 

They can raise your rates for liablity claims (you hitting someone, and 
pay for THEIR damages), collision claims (you hit something, and pay to 
fix YOUR car).

They cannot charge you a higher premium for damages that someone else
has done.

In respect to that, if you live in a bad neighborhood or "territory"
they can raise your
premiums as the likelines of damage to your car is increased.

If your insurance does try to increase your premuim because of your
claim, check with
the Department of Insurance for your State.
