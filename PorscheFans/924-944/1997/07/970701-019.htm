You might loose this one....
How many F1, rally, endurance drivers started their career running go
karts, ski-doos etc... Not very hard to turn in circles, Avus in Berlin
was a close concept on the ovals in US, this on the 20's, the only
difference was the hairpin turn in one of the ends, and the HUGE
parabolic curb on the other side...

Think about Hans Stuck, Rally, endurance, F1, hill clibing and more
other things on the dance card for this gentleman. I don't think that
many NASCAR racers have some kind of close background as some F1
pilots...
