Well, what a day we had yesterday at Mission.  Lots and lots of imports
(most of them really slow!) and some interesting times, problems and
mysteries.

First run out, Paul and I grudge match each other.  Being that we are
extremely competitive with each other, we both decide to launch our cars
WAAAAY higher RPM than we had planned.  Paul's car takes off, I slaughter
him with my R/T.  Alright!  First gear hits the rev limiter really quick,
wow that's a slippery surface, hard shift to second gear, wow, rev limiter
again, this track sure is slippery, hard shift to third, (by this time
Paul is waaaay ahead of me) and rev limiter again???  OH OH, the clutch
never grabbed once I slipped it off the line, it was just slipping!
Yikes.  Let off, let the revs drop back down to wheel speed and floor
it again, it hooked fine at that point.  First run:

         Paul        Farz
R/T     1.221       0.922
60'     2.549       2.548
330'    6.598       7.126
660'    9.735      11.027
MPH     79.23       67.77
1000   12.381      13.982

1/4    14.593      16.322
MPH    102.65       97.28

At this point, people would not stand within 10ft of my car, it stunk
so bad!  I took the car out to the street, if I tried to launch harder
than 2000rpm by slipping the clutch, it would not grab.  I think I glazed
it with my "Talon-type" of launch.  Paul's got the latest and greatest
Turbo Cup clutch which he had installed last week so his clutch
held up nicely.

On my race mechanic's recommendation, I did my second run with a street start
launch just to see what MPH the car would pull and to make sure that the
clutch will grab in the higher gears.  Keep in mind that at this point,
PDM's customer's Civic with an Integra GS-R motor in it is running 14.3 @
97mph and we were slower!  The 2nd run:

         Paul        Farz
R/T     1.096       1.097 
60'     2.378       2.948 
330'    6.221       7.256
660'    9.321      10.475
MPH     79.90       77.16
1000   11.955      13.157

1/4    14.163      15.377
MPH    102.92      102.24

This was good.  The 102 shows that the clutch was grabbing.  My last run
was one of those decisions in life you have to make.  Do a hard run and
get a good time and maybe break the car, or just take it easy and see
if you can improve the MPH.  So, of course, against everyone's suggestions,
I decided to "Make it or Break it".  At this point, Paul was the fastest
and quickest non-nitrous import there.  All I did was take the baby up
to 5500rpm and as soon as I saw the yellow lights flash on the pro-tree
start, I dumped the clutch.  I told the group that if you see
the tires spin, I'll make it home, if you don't see the tires spin, call
the Tow Truck!

         Paul        Farz
R/T     0.945       0.813
60'     2.264       2.379
330'    6.081       6.163
660'    9.148       9.252
MPH     80.60       80.07
1000   11.764      11.864

1/4    13.960      14.085
MPH    103.34      102.04

If you look at the segment time from run 2 from 660 to the end, you will
see that I gained more MPH on my 2nd run.  I decided to try and shift
into fourth on my last run.  That was a mistake.  Paul was on my bumper
and a 13 second run was there, but I thought I might be able to make
up a bit more time landing in the torque peak.  As soon as I shifted,
Paul came up to my passenger door handle!  YIKES!  I still managed to
beat him to the end, but I lost out on ET and MPH on that last run.  No
biggie, I know it's there.  Paul was the only non-nitrous import to
get into the 13's and I think I had the second fastest ET of the non-
nitrous imports.  On his last run, his clutch stunk like mine did on 
the first run.  On my last run, no clutch smell at all!

Other cars for sake of comparison:
Ed "Banzai" Wong's "400hp" Camaro		13.9 @ 104mph
Acura NSX					14.3 @ 102mph
Dodge Viper					13.7 @ 105mph
Corvette on HUGE nitrous			12.2 @ 121mph
Blue street racer Mustang			11.2 @ 128mph
Typhon or Cyclone or something		13.6 @ 97mph
Kevin's Integra GSR powered Civic		14.3 @ 97mph

Kevin grudge matched the NSX and beat him 14.33 VS. 14.35!  The crowd
was laughing like crazy at the NSX driver.

Other notables:
Dodge Neon with Nitrous			13.6 @ 102mph
Honda Civic with Nitrous			13.6 @ 104mph

As you can see from our times, we have to do a lot of work to the cars
to make them really fast.  Our Talon started out at 14.505 @ 97mph
and we brought it up quite a bit, so no need to worry, next time out,
we'll be high 13's @ 105-106mph.  I've already ordered the parts :)

One bizarre thing.  My Talon made one hell of an impression on the 
regulars there.  I couldn't believe the number of people that remembered
the car and remembered me.  I had at least 10 people walk up to me and
ask me questions about the Talon.  Most people thought the Porsche
was the Talon :)

So, everyone says, don't slip the clutch, don't do this, don't do that.
Now you know why.  Slipping the factory clutch over a certain threshold
results in continuous slipping.  It's better to do an easy launch 2000rpm
or lower or just dropt he puppy from 5500rpm+.  You may break a spring
in the plate or break the rear end, but at least you don't get that
stinky smell.

The times are slow and the MPH is low, but no one ever won a race first
time out.  This gives us a good baseline to improve on.  The 60' times
suck, but that's OK.  The bigger concern I have is the low MPH.  The
conditions weren't ideal for turbo cars, hot and humid, so perhaps in
other conditions, we could get a 105 or something.  I hated the fact
my MPH was so low on my last run when Paul's was so high, but the video
shows me losing some ground when I shifted it 4th, so I hope it's there!

Farz.
14.0 @ 102mph @ 14psi.
13.7 @ 105mph (soon).
