Hello all....

Just when I thought it was safe to spend money on something else......!! 
 Having had the front wheel bearings (and hubs but thats another story) 
replaced a few weeks ago, I started hearing similar noises from the rear. I 
took her to the shop and the mechanic said it was my differential bearings 
(the ones either side). Is this going to cost the earth to fix..?? Is it 
repairable or is it time for a new diff. ? Your advice would be greatly 
appreciated.

TIA

Garry.
