Hi all -
Well, the transmission is out and apart.  Or at least the differential 
side plate is off....
What I found is a carrier that has broken at both points on the ring
gear
side and one point on the opposite end.  ...
So the decision, do I buy a rebuilt/used transaxle or do I repair it. 
.... 
Sure would be easier to just install another transaxle.
....
Thanks for everyones suggestions and help.

You answered your own question. It is cheaper to buy a used rear end and
put it in yourself. I have done this, Joe at PAP in Atlanta could get
you a good used one. You might consider going to a S or TURBO transaxel,
they are built to take more torque, get LSD if you can.. I busted my
85.5 autocrossing and put in a S rearend no problem. For a good home
mechanic it takes about 2.5 hours to get it out and about 3 to put it
back in properly. There are some tricks to the mounts write me if you
want details, my Hayes manual only had the mounts for the pre 85.5 cars.
While you are back there change your fuel filter.
