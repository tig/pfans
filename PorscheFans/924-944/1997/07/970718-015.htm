The dealer parts counter has all but given up on finding the part number
for those
cheap white plastic clips that break all the time under the driver's side
dashboard. They hold the actuator arms for the climate control system shutter
doors. I even brought the broken one in to the parts counter with me!

You'd think they'd know the number or even what the part is for, since this is
evidently a common failure on these cars.

Oh well, any help from a list member who knows the number would be GREATLY
appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Chris,
The parts guy at my dealership didn't have a clue either. I ended up going
through the microfiche reader with him and found it myself.

The part number for this is 944-572-314-00. ($.72/ea)

He had two in stock and I bought them both this winter while picking up a
rear wheel bearing. I stashed one in my ashtray just in case. Two weeks ago
I was driving down the road and noticed that the temp in the car was very
hot so I pulled off  the road climbed under the dash and sure enough the
clip was broken. It took about a minute to replace and I was on my way
again. Clip #2 is now waiting in my ashtray.
