What's up? You forgot the one that started it all! It also happens to be the
one that many people feel was the best for various reasons. Lighter weight
ect. (right George). Also because it was the first to hit a big market many
people said it was simply built better, as to not have any problems, and was
probably faster because the factory did some tweeking. What is this great
set of wheels? Why it's my '86 951. Surly an oversight.
