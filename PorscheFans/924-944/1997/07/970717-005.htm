       This is not directed at any one individual so don't wig out on me. A
few years ago, when I had less brains and less money, I raced motorcycles in
Colorado. A friend and I would work out for endurance, while being very
careful about what we ate because we wanted strength but not the additional
mass (i.e. weight). At the track we would talk to "racers" who spent
thousands of dollars on lightweight body parts, wheels, and helmets. The sad
and pathetic part was that most of these "racers" were 10+ pounds overweight
themselves, with no desire to lose it there.
        I have also been at the track for DE days and spoke/saw people who
spend tons of cash on all these great improvements to make them "faster",
the same problem is there, only different. My advice is learn to drive what
you have. When you are at the cars limit, which being honest most of us will
never get to, then add the bigger this or lighter that. Yes, I know, most
changes are to make a car/motorcycle more drivable by adjusting rev limits,
earlier boost, better response. As one person I know says, "learn to turn!".
OK boys and girls get out the flame throwers.
