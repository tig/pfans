Well, I figured that someday it would happen.  Wife and I went out
Friday night.  Parked my car under the lights in the mall parking lot.
Enjoyed dinner and a movie.  When we returned, some %$#@$%^& had keyed
the entire car.  Of what socially redeeming value did the keying of my
car represent?  The car is now in the paint shop for new paint to the
tune of $2,100.00.  Insurance will cover it, but I'm sure my rates will
go up because of the sick individual(s) who had nothing better to do
than enjoy trashing my car.  I had planned on removing my idle
stabilizer this past weekend and posting to those that had been
interested in this job, however I will have to wait for the return of my
car.
