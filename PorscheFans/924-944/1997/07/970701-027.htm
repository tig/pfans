Ok, so I went out and bought a 968 windscreen from Sonnen as was
recommended here on these pages over the last few weeks.  Just as
everyone said, the windscreen works great. Significantly less noise and
wind.  I can see how it will prolong the open air season for my cab.

However, I can no longer get my top cover on (did someone call it a
tonneau?)  I don't think this is a big deal because frankly, I think the
cover is more cosmetic than functional regardless of what the manual
says, however, it would be nice to use if it can be put on easily.  Has
anyone successfully used the windscreen and the cover at the same time?

Thanks in advance.
