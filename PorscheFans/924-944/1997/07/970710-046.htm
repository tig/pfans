Rog:

	I believe I was responsible for the last mention of the wet okole seat
covers. I bought a pair for my red/black 944S.  The cloth inserts had
rotted (the PO was a paramedic and, I suspect, got back in the car after
one too many chemical fires). I got the red with black inserts from
Performance Products.  
	I wrote the list to warn that, unless otherwise specified, your covers
will come with the "Wet Okole" logo prominently displayed on the front of
the headrests in white. I found this tacky, but would also add that Wet
Okole made direct FREE replacement with logo-less versions.  I then saw a
post by someone who said, for an extra few bucks,  Wet Okole would put a
Porsche insignia on the covers which might be worth considering.
	In any case, I think the covers are great!! I live in south Florida, and
have no trouble with excess heat altho "cool in Summer" may be overstating
it. I suspect they would more likely be "warm in Winter."  They look
fantastic in my car. The red is not quite Guards, but it fits nicely.  They
are fairly well padded and, if you're already using up all the room in your
cockpit they may drive you out of the car.  The smell is definitely
neoprene which, if you're a diver, may provoke nostalgia, but its not a
real problem.  
	I removed the seats to install the bottom portions which is probably best
(I needed to, anyway, to rewire one of the power seat controls).  The backs
fit easily.  They are not quite so tight as to be molded to the seat, but
they are tight enough.  I protected them as suggested with a spray and I
went to the local dive shop (South Florida, right!) for some wet suit
shampoo which I have yet to use. After three or four months, there is some
dirt evident, but I suspect they will clean.  
	Good Luck.
