Hi all,
	I have a few ??s about airbags.

	While my 88T came OEM w/ airbags, PO told me that the 
car had none.  This is obvious by inspection on the driver's 
side which was replaced with a MOMO wheel.  On the passenger 
side, the cover is in place.  I have found someone setting up 
an 87 for tracking who is willing to part with both airbags.  
I'm definitely buying the drivers side and would like to buy 
the passenger side but I don't know how to see what is in 
there.
(aside) This waiting for shop manuals BITES and I've found the 
Haynes useless for the most part.

Can anyone tell me how to remove the airbag cover so I can 
check out the inside.  Anyone have any pointers about replacing 
airbags?  Anybody interested in selling a manual set.  With the 
current backlog on manuals, would anybody be willing to 
photocopy the relevent section for a nominal fee?  My local 
dealer is useless (bring the car in, leave it AND your 
checkbook and we'll get back to you )

Thanks....Greg
