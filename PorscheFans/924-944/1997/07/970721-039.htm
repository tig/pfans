I recently subscribed to this list because we are having the same problem with
out 1992 968 coupe.  We bought the car new and when it was about a year old
it started having this problem.  We brought it in under warranty and the
dealer said the tank vent line got pinched during installation which caused
the seal on the gas gauge sender to leak.  They put a new sender in and dropped
the tank as much as they could without removing the rear end to try to
straighten to vent line.  Anyway it helped some but we still get the odor,
especially after filling up the tank.

We traded in a 924s in on this car which used to have the same problem.  After
I saw the tank damp on the sides after filling it up one winter I bit the
bullet and dropped the rear end and the tank.  It turns out the tank had
cracked along a crease stamped into the top of the tank.  I called the dealer
and they wanted $1000 for a new tank so I contacted Porsche NA and they agreed
to put in a new tank.  All was fine for awhile, then the stong gas odors
returned.  I removed the interior trim from the right side of the rear
hatch area and removed to metal cover over the fuel filler hose.  The hose
clamps were not very tight on this hose (large diameter hose that goes between
the fuel filler and the tank).  Anyway, tightening these clamps finally
fixed the gas odors.  I suspect this may be some of the problem on our
968.
