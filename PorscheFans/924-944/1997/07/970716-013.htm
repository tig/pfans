Jay, are you sure that the water valve is internally closing??  We see a
lot of valves that the external arm is closed, but the internal valve is
still open.  With your engine at operating temp, feel the in/out hoses
from the engine to the valve for temp changes.  

For your engine cooling--What is the value of the engine thermoswitch in
the radiator??  To see if a cooler thermoswitch will help, jump the
wires from the switch on a hot day so the fan will run continously...see
if the engine runs cooler...if it does, run a lower temp switch.  If
that does not make the engine run cooler, run your hand over the fins of
the radiator with the engine hot...is the radiator hot evenly across the
fins (we use an infrared heat detector for this)??  If there are cooler
spots, pull the radiator and have it cleaned out.

My 924 on a hot day runs a little under the 1/2 mark on the gauge.

Two other things...with the gauge at the 3/4 mark, turn on your
headlights, a/c, rear window def., etc.  If the needle on the gauge
jumps up or down, you have a bad ground problem, which can probably be
fixed by checking to be sure that the engine is securely grounded to the
chassis/battery.  Run an auxilary cable if necessary.

If all else fails, a 944 radiator can be installed in the 924 radiator's
place with a little fabrication...but you really shouldn't have to do
that on a street car.    

Good luck...Don Istook
