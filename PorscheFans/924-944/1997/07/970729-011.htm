I have driven an '88 944S for 2 years and have been pretty happy 
with it.  However the S does have a bit of a bad reputation generally 
with Porsche dealers and servicers.  There is a hell of a flat spot 
below 4000 RPM which means you really need to keep the revs up to get 
a good drive out of it.  This may be how you like to drive 
anyway..lots of people say that this is one of the most appealling 
things about the S.  It basically has one of the first generation 16V 
heads which shared the flat spot problems with other cars of the era 
such as VW Golfs etc.  I have heard that you can get the heads gas 
flowed etc that makes them much better but then you are into real money!

If the other 944 is the 2.7 litre model, I have been told that this is
a better drive with only marginal difference in performance.
Also I have been told that the 8 valve car is more sought after
than the S for the reasons outlined above.  

Maintenance-wise all I can offer is the opinion of my my unbiased  
mechanic who calls the 944S the car with the chocolate engine!  but 
then I haven't had any problems with the car in the time I have had 
it (with the engine anyway!).

If its the 2.5 litre model then I think personally I would have the 
S.  The performance of the 2.5 is not great and at least the 16v head 
will give you that rush at 4K rpm.

As I have already been told on this page its all down to personal 
taste.  Drive them both and go by gut feel..thats what I did and I am 
pretty happy with my new baby :)
