Heard this today.  While I was the "butt" of the joke, I couldn't help but
laugh!

A horse and a rabbit are walking through a field.
The horse steps in what looks like mud, but turns out to be quicksand.
The horse starts to sink.  "Go get the farmer!" he says to the rabbit.
The rabbit goes for the farmer, but can't find him.
He looks around and sees the farmer's Porsche, though.
Thinking quickly, he grabs a rope, throws it into the Porsche and drives to
the horse.
He ties one end of the rope to the bumper, throws the other end to the horse,
     and pulls the horse to safety.

The next day, the two are out walking in the field again.
This time, the rabbit steps in the quicksand and starts to sink.
He yells to the horse to go get the farmer.
The horse hesitates..."wait a minute rabbit, I think I can do this myself."
The horse reaches with his front legs across the quicksand, straddling it,
and tells
     the rabbit to grab onto his penis and pull himself free.
The rabbit grabs on,  climbs up the horse's penis, and frees himself from the
     quagmire.

The moral of the story?

If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a Porsche!!!

Enjoy,
Kevin B
