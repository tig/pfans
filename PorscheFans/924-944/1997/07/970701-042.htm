Mine gets warm, so I would assume so.

I don't know why they are out of print, but the microfiche version is 
readily available, and it is under $30!  You can use a microfiche reader 
at a library or university, and make copies of pages you need, if the 
equipment is capable.  I purchased my own reader used at an office 
equipment liquidator for $35.

There has been discussion on the list of scanning the entire 'fiche onto
CD ROM for personal use, but it is not legal, despite Porsche's inability
to supply a paper manual. Auto manufacturers are required to have repair
manuals available for cars sold in the US by law.  Perhaps the microfiche
version is the loophole here.
