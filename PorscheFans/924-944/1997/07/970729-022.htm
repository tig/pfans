Well, I was the one who originated that post, but I don't currently have
access to a copy of it, since I just switched systems, and don't yet have
access to my files from my previous system. However, there may be
someone else out there who kept a copy. I think it really should be added
to the FAQ... isn't Kevin Gross in charge of that? Kevin?

As for the failure method, I think the way you described it is exactly how
mine failed. However, I haven't yet found a good glue for it; as
mentioned, I tried one, but it's failing... I'm going to give a few local
sources a call, see what they suggest... (The local Porsche dealer
shows no part #)  I'll keep you and the list posted...

        Well, looks like I experience both judder and shudder in my 951...
        
                During violent acceleration, and especially when accelerating 
        over bumps in the road, my car can "shudder" and it feels like I'm going 
        crossing over railroad tracks.  I always attributed it to loss of 
        traction, but maybe it is something else (am I running over a Ducati?).  
        If it's really bad, I would suggest replacing or adjusting your rear 
        shock settings--I think it may help.
        
        Ben

And so I ask...
     
What's "judder"?  This was the first time I have heard of it, so I looked 
it up.  My spell checker never heard of "judder".  Time to try the 
Webster's Dictionary.  Basically the dictionary said to see "shudder". 
Upon looking up "shudder" I was directed to look up "judder", and so it 
goes.
     
Speaking of judder, shudder, or peanut butter, my 89 Turbo exhibits a 
judder, shudder at launch (that's launch, not lunch, your thinking peanut 
butter).
     
The warmer it gets, the greater the shudder/judder as I turn the rudder 
(okay, the wheel) and putter down the road.
     
At first I thought it was the clutch (just put one of those Turbo Cup 
clutches in), or I might be dogging it when I start, but I got the 
shudders/judders when I started crossing bumps after a recent road rally. 
It sounded like I was losing the exhaust or a wheel or something.
     
I immediately put the car up on stands after my arrival to check the tail. 
We did have a few DNFs during the rally and I wanted to make sure I hadn't 
snagged any of those cars under the rear wheels.
     
I could find no signs of excessive play in the exhaust, the CV joints, or 
wheels.  I did notice that I could rock the transaxle back and forth by 
grabbing the oil cooler and shaking.  I tried the same thing with my 87 
944S (55K miles) and found it about as loose.
     
Could the rear transaxle mount cause the car to shudder/judder when you 
launch your car at lunch turning the rudder, as I begin to putter, munching 
on a sandwich of peanut butter, yet the car will never stutter, tracking 
true, not in the gutter?
     
Anyone have an experience like this?  Really!
