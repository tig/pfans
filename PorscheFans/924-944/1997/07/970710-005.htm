Well The guy who owns the dyno is doing a wild buildup now and is going
for 600 HP at the rear wheels.. Right now he has 394 but hasn't added the
Supercharger or Nitrous.... you say that engine will last a week? No he
rebuilt it with the best forged components.  That is the guy I was talking
about selling his 944 V8 kit.  HIs friends who are geniuses in NA power
have 442 HP at the rear wheels in NA 350s with heads, cam, headers, TB,
etc.  The last guy around this area that I will mention; they all build and
work on each
others engines; has 569 HP at the rear wheels with the wild 350 that has
the awesome NA motor but added an intercooled Procharger supercharger.  I
have seen these cars run and they are BAD! You would think that they would
be all out racecars and be trailered but they all made the drive to
Memphis ~800 miles for all of them. Ill keep looking for that dyno stuff.


Necessary Porsche content; anyone know if indeed the 924S spoiler is the
944 spoiler or the 924 turbo spoiler or '81 82 924 spoiler?
