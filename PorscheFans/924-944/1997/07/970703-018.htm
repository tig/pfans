<<(2)     You don't have to drill a hole in the floor for your anti-sub
belt.  I
use a ~2-2/12" wide strip of 3/16" thick steel which stretches across
the
front seat rail mounting bolts.  Thus, the two bolts which hold down the
front part of the seat rails sandwich this bracket between the car and
the
bottom of the rails.  My anti-sub belt is then attached to the middle of
this
simple bracket.  The anti-sub belts are positioned correctly to prevent
submarining.  I use slightly longer-than-stock high grade bolts to hold
down
the seats and the brackets to accomodate for the thickness of the
bracket
(3/16").>>

I've heard of others attaching sub belts this way, but I think the sub
belt needs to be mounted at or behind your crotch to be totally
effective. Running the belt over the front of the seat is giving you a
decent amount of room to submarine.  I still think the best approach is
to use a 6-pt. system and attach the anti-subs to the same points you
mount the lap belt. Some organizations, such as the SCCA think you
should use different mounting points, but I simply don't see the need.
If you lose one of the lap belt mounting points, your antisub belt isn't
goind to do you *any* good! 

<<As many of you know, I had a shunt at Laguna in my first 951 (an '89
with 31k
miles).  The belt system and seat worked well, although the Weltmeister
harness bar I had at the time was slightly bent, I was completely
uninjured
and unmarked. Wasn't even sore.  I hit a wall at maybe 40 mph almost
head on.>>

This is *very* distressing. I had initial fears with the flimsiness of
the Weltmeister (aka Automotion!) harness bar. Now I have some empirical
data. What if your accident had been at 80? E=m*v*v. I hate to go to the
expense of a Brey-Krause, but it looks like there is no other safe
choice except to install a roll bar/cage.

Anybody want to buy a Weltmeister (aka Automotion) harness bar that is
currently straight? <g>
