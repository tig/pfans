Has everyone been having trouble with the list? I haven't received a
regular posting in about two weeks, and have re-subscribed twice. Hope I
don't get three subscriptions now!

As a result, I don't know if my last message went out or not, so I'm
resubmitting in case.


I have a problem with my cooling fans, and I can't seem to trace it down
using the Hayne's manual and wiring diagram. Both of my fans come on in
high speed ( a/c is not operational, compressor clutch is physically
removed, etc. ) when the temp is just at or slightly above the second
mark. They will continue to run even if the temp gauge drops well below
the first mark, and I've even had them start right up as soon as I start
the car after it's been sitting for 2-3 hours and is actually in the
cold range on the gauge. I would assume I have a problem with the temp
sensor that controls the fans, but the first fan works fine (comes on at
the second mark and off at just below the first mark), so I'm not sure
if it's the sensor or the relay sticking.

It would appear to me that the first fan should come on say, just below
or at the second mark, in slow speed, followed by the second fan, also
in slow speed, somewhere above the second mark, reversed as the temp
decreases. They should only run in high when the A/C is on and it's hot.
My A/C system doesn't work, has the clutch physically removed from the
compressor, and hasn't worked in over a year(got to get it fixed before
long, cus' it's already gotton to 105'F here), so I can't figure out why
the fans are running on high to begin with. The Hayne's manual doesn't
provide much in the way of normal operation, and seems to reference the
single pole switch only in it's description anyway.

I hate to easter egg a problem, and I'd really like to understand what's
happening. Any advice?

TIA
