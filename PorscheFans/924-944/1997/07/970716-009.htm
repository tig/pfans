hi Bob,

> Just read your post on the LIST about your ac conversion.  You basically just
> "dropped in" the 134a?  If so, you may have a serious problem in the future.
>  I think your seals may all start to deteriorate.  Although this may not be

The oil you add to the system is supposed to 'protect' the seals
from the R134A. Of course, only time will tell. 

> So it works, huh?  I thought you had to use a different valving system or

I didn't change anything. The A/C is ice cold. Yesterday, it was 90
and very humid. I had to raise the temp on tempatrol dial because the
a/c was freezing me!

> I'm VERY interested in hearing how the system holds up for you.  How's is it

If the compressor stops working, or the seals go bad and I loose
all the 134a, I'll make another post. For now, assume no news is
good news.

> Finally, who makes the kit you used?

Interdynamic. The kit was $30, and I had to buy two cans of 
R134A @ $5.00 each, for a total of $40.
