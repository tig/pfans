     Hi Kevin
     
     As an authority on 944 transmissions, I wondered if you wouldn't mind 
     giving your view on what lateral play is normal/acceptable on 
     differential output shafts.
     
     I have been seeking the source of a minor rattle/clunk from the rear 
     of my S2 for months without success.  The noise occurs on bumpy roads, 
     and is most noticeable for the first few miles driving.  The only 
     thing I have found is that both diff drive flanges will move in and 
     out of the diff housing by a mm or so (the centre retaining screws are 
     tight by the way), and clunk as they hit the end of travel.  Is this 
     normal, and do you think it could be the noise source?
     
     TIA
     
     Mike
