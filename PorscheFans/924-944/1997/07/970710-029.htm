Boy, did this post ever hit close to home!

Paid the same for an 87 NA with higher miles, a year ago. Not sure if it
was love, or lust...

June 96, for me.

Ah, yes. My list reads: water pump, hoses, belts, engine seals, shocks (4),
new front disks, brake pads all 'round. At this writing, it's in the shop
for oil cooler seals. The mainstream work has kept me from indulging the
impulse for aftermarket toys (so far). On The List: rear speakers are dead,
the a/c quit, and the climate control panel doesn't work.

I'm afraid to add it up!

Tony, I second your cautionary advice for potential '44 buyers. The selling
price of the car is only part of the story. I thought I was prepared - I'd
read and re-read the 944 FAQ, I had the car checked by a reputable shop
before buying it, etc. I was *still* caught by surprise when the bills
started coming in.

I know all you future 944 owners out there are shaking your head your head,
saying "Yeah, but that won't happen to *me*!" So, since you are going to go
ahead and buy one anyway, a few observations.

1. Murphy (if it can go wrong, it will) must have been a black sheep of the
Porsche family.
2. Read the FAQ. Contrary to what you might think, the 944 FAQ is not a
list of things that might happen, it is a prediction of your future. Know
that everything on the FAQ will happen to you - it's only a question of
time! (And not very much time, either!)
3. Read the Pfan list. At least you'll know that fate hasn't singled you
out to single-handedly support the car parts industry.

The bottom line? I still love the car. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.
Go figure!
