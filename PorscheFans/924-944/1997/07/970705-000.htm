Greetings fellow Porshefans

My 1987 944S with 87k miles recently developed a slight PERIODIC (RPM
related) vibration in the drivetrain that is felt in the gearshift
lever. It also started simultaneously with a change in the exhaust
sound. 
While doing a quick inspection of the exhaust, I noticed a couple of
small holes in the tailpipe that may be coincidental. They have been
temporarily repaired. (Given that I believe the exhaust system is the
original one, I am in the quest for a new exhaust system -cat-back is
one piece). Prior to embarking on the exhaust system replacement, I am
seeking guidance on diagnosing my vibration problem: I feel the
vibration and the exhaust are linked - I plan to jack the car up this
week-end and inspect it and accordingly would appreciate any quick
feedback and suggestions. 

The Symptoms
1-  The vibration is felt @ approx. 1650RPM and 3300 or so with the car
still, clutch in or out, also with the car moving in any gear, also with
the clutch in or out. Vibration while driving is felt in the gearknob
and clearly affects the exhaust sound. While parked, the vibration is
clearly evident on the exhaust tailpipe and exhaust rattle (small), also
on the catalytic converter- shield area. Engine is smooth. 
2-  At higher RPMs, the exhaust sound seems throatier / hollower -pretty
good actually.  
3-  The car runs fine, clutch has plenty of bite (believe you me!!) and
does not vibrate under heavy acceleration - passing the 1650 and 3300
rpm vicinities, I barely feel the vibration.  

A friend of mine who has owned several 944 (none w/16 valves) suggested
failed rubber clutch disk pieces, cracked header, bad engine mount,
torque
tube bearing, counterbalance shaft belt jumping one tooth, etc…

Help Needed
1-  Any help, suggestions or diagnosis tips for narrowing down the
vibration would be greatly appreciated. It is the cause or the symptom
with the exhaust. 
2-  Any suggestions on replacement exhausts would also be greatly
appreciated. After getting some suggestions from a previous posting to
PorsheFans, I made a few phone calls to advertisers in Panorama and have
found that the 944S exhaust system is not the same as the 944. Although
ANSA lists one, I was told they do not make it. It’s either a $550
"factory" system or a $250 Bursch from Europroducts. (Automotion did not
list any 944S exhausts!).Any experience or suggestions with the exhaust
systems or the vendors/suppliers and buying exhausts by mail would be
also greatly appreciated.
