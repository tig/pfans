This is a fact, and quite true, any coolant fluid is made more effecient
if it's surface tension is lowered.

Water is wet, obviously, but it will get even 'wetter' with less surface
tension.

It works like this (if memory serves me right): Small bubbles forms on
the hot metal surface. As soon these bubbles are formed, they will
contain gas (steam) and will significantly lessen the heat conduction
properties of the fluid. This is called 'void ratio'. Anyone wanting to
actually see this happen, just have a look at the bottom of the pan
(pot?) next time you boil eggs... Then you will see those small bubbles,
adhering to the metal. Then, all happening pretty fast, big bubbles
form, and rise to the surface... 

Localized boiling may also occur on hot spots, mostly in the head area.
any hot spot not surrounded by enough cooling water may be regarded as a
design flaw. However, due to scale buildup, localized boiling may become
a gradually rising problem on old engines.

I don't think there will be any noticeable boundary flow (laminar flow).
The surfaces are rough and there are to many turbulence creating
obstacles in the cooling water stream. It would rather be beneficient to
have swirl effects incorporated in the design, to thoroughly mix and
even out temperature in the fluid. Water, as opposed to oil, does not
change much in viscosity between its phase shifts (ice-water and
water-steam). Aerated water (with lot of bubbles in it) will tend to
rise (carried by its bubbles).

The car is not allowed to run *without* anti-freeze, the engine will
corrode...  :-).  Anti-freeze has a surface tension lowering effect,
too. As it is also rising the boiling point, it would seem to be the
perfect solution (pun!). Now, water has a strange property, it will
store more energy before it boils than most fluids. This is one of the
reasons why a 50/50 mix of glycol and water may not be sufficient to
move enough heat from the engine. If you are racing seriously, then
destilled water (with water wetter) will be 
usable, and will give you slightly better heat transfer cabability. 

Ususally, long before this borderline problem occurs, other problems
should be investigated. Scale may have formed in the radiator, even to
the extent that some tubes are completely blocked. The thermostat may
not open sufficiently, or early enough. Scale even forms on the inside
of the engine, and will worsen the heat transfer capacity. This can be
chemically treated, but it is not quite risk free. Use a radiator flush
chemical that is safe for aluminium.
