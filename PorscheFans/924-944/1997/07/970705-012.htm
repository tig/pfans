Well, the sneaky girlfriend's neighbor guy did it to me today.  He is a small
aircraft engine mechanic here in town, so I usually assume he knows something.

:(

He says that turbos (aircraft turbos anyway) don't leak oil because of bad
bearings (well, not usually),  but that they leak because of a problem with the
return flow of oil to the crankcase (i.e. too much crank case pressure).

He said the turbo seals will leak (they aren't meant to keep oil in; well what
are they there for?) because the return flow is blocked; causing oil to build
up in the turbo and flow out the bearings.

Now this isn't what I want to hear.  I'd rather my turbo go bad than have to
rebuild the dang head.  (I guess I'll be doing compression tests...)


Anybody have any input on this?  Aircraft engines have really low redlines
(2500 rpm), so those turbos operate at a slightly different capacity, but a
turbos a turbo a turbo, right?

THanks!
