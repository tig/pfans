I believe that there is a FAQ that applies to purchasing a new 944.
Someone on the list should be able to direct you to the address on the Web.

The 1988 Turbo S was the introduction of a midyear model that had a number
of enhancements that were highly desirable.  Among them was the M030 sport
suspension, chassis stiffening, wider forged wheels with the rear wheel
fender lips rolled for added tire clearance, larger brake system, premium
stereo system, and additional horse power (247 vs. 217).

The first run of these cars were only available in Metallic Rose paint with
a plaid cloth interior that must of had its roots in the '60s polyester
age.  The remaining 700 U.S. run of these cars were available with standard
interiors and exterior colors.  Unique for the 1988 model was the split
back rear seats.

In 1989 the "S" insignia was dropped, but the model retained all of the "S"
enhancements (except for the split back rear seats and plaid interior).  I
happen to own one of about 1300 models imported to the U.S. that year.

In 1990 there were but a handful of the Turbos imported.  These cars were
identical to the previous model, but may represent a better collector
status due to the extremely low numbers available.

During that following year, a topless model (Turbo Cabrio) was introduced
in a limited number production of 500 (about 250 for the U.S.).  This was
the farewell to the 944 Turbo from Zuffenhausen as production was halted
after this rare model.

There are two articles on the Turbo S and 91 Turbo Cabrio, that I am aware
of, available in Excellence magazine.  The first was in their February 1988
issue (page 37).  And the other was the October 1991 issue (page 54).  Both
can be bought directly from Ross publishing (415 382-0580) for $5.00 each.

Prices vary all over the automotive spectrum for these cars as the
production numbers are too low to get good average sales figures.  Expect
to see prices start at about $14,000 to $15,000 and spiral upward as
rapidly as the speedometer does on those models.

Calling 1 800 PORSCHE will get you in touch with someone who can direct you
to the PCNA (Porsche Cars North America).  Given the VIN number of any
potential vehicle you see, the PCNA can give you valuable data on that car.
