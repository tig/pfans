Hey dudes, (back to my pre-dyno hello)

Got the test pipes in the mail today.  They look really good.  I was
expecting some cheap pipe since I assumed, you get what you pay for.
Instead, I got a nice painted (or could be coated with something) pipe
with the wastegate attachment, etc. exactly 5 days after ordering it.
Now, that's good service.  I highly recommend German Parts and Restoration.

The pipe is going on tommorow, and if I have any money left on my credit
card [:)], I'll get it dynoed this Saturday to see if it made any
power difference.

Hey Hansman, I was pretty close on guessing what you had done eh? :)
At 17lbs, the car must haul.  I tried 20lbs a while back, but it would
still only spin the tires in 3rd over bumps.  Anyone running 17lbs of 
boost for long periods of time should consider using racing gas.  
Especially if it's a stock turbo, it'll be pumping so much hot air into
the engine, even the IC won't be able to keep up.

Farzaan.
