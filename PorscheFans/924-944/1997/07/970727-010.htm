Unfortunately, you are a victim of the infamous rubber center clutch.  My
clutch does the same thing on hot days, sitting in traffic or otherwise
keeping the clutch heated for a long period of time.  The next day, or
after a drive on the freeway, the clutch cools and the judder goes away.
However, the shaking isn't violent on my car, so your rubber center may 
be starting to deteriorate, despite the ample presence of clutch lining.

This is caused by the rubber softening with heat, which then allows a
rhythmic (harmonic) vibration with the drive shaft, which has a slight
amount of flex itself.  If the rubber has separated in places, the
symptoms are worse.  My clutch is about 40 percent worn as well, but
otherwise works fine unless it gets really hot. 

If this problem is chronic, the clutch can be replaced with a spring
centered unit.  However, the engagement isn't quite as silky and cushioned
as the rubber centered unit.  It is possible the factory has improved the
rubber centered unit, but someone else with more information than I may
want to verify here.
