Doug,

How could you!  That was cruel. It wasn't my fault. Ya see, there's this
Euro car shop down in Ft Collins. Poudre Sports - they repair and also sell
a few used BMWs and Porsches that they've worked on. Seems like every time
I stop by, they've got something interesting on the lot. In fact that's how
I got my S2. The 911S was just sitting there looking cute and cheap, and
they forced the keys into my hands. What could I do?  And besides, my S2
was not at all offended. Just sat there with a smug grin on it's front
spoiler.

And what were you doing checking out the 911 server anyway, Doug? Fess up.

-- Nick
