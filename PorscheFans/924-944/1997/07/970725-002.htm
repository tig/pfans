Hello,

Since a number of people have asked, I'm going to just
post the transaxle oil change procedure.

                    Changing Transaxle Fluid in a 944

This ShadeTree mechanic article will describe the steps required to
change the transaxle fluid in a 944. I recommend the transaxle
fluid be changed at least every 50,000 miles. If you track your 944
(and I recommend that you do that too), you might want to change
the fluid more often.

Tools Required:

This is a fairly simple job, and no special tools are required
(well, you might think a 17mm Allen hex key is special, but it
isn't). Here is what you will need:

1. Floor Jack (bigger is better)
2. Jackstands (2)
3. 17mm Allen hex key (available from Sears, Snap On, or you could
  borrow one)
4. Drain pan (1 gallon is large enough)
5. 4 foot of hose (old garden hose is fine)
6. funnel
7. Transaxle fluid - according to the technical specifications
  manual, you need "approx. 2 liters hypoid transmission oil, SAE
  75W/90, API Class GL 5 or MIL-L 2105 B or SAE 80 API Class GL 4
  or MIL-L 2105." I use Swepco 201, others use Redline Synthetic
  MTL, or Mobil 1 75W/90 gear oil.

Some notes on safety:
-I recommend that you use a heavy duty floor jack and heavy duty
  jackstands. Sears frequently has a combination of floor jack and
  jackstands on sale for about $100. Please do not use the jack
  that comes with the car. That jack is light duty, and should
  only be used in an emergency. 
-When you lift the car, use the factory lifting points, and chock
  the opposite wheels. For example, on the 944, the factory
  jacking point is right below the door. There is a diamond shape
  mark in the lower rocker panel. On the underside of the car is
  a 'cup' that should fit in the saddle of the jack. Jacking the
  car from this point will lift both wheels on that side. When the
  car has been lifted, place jackstands under the rear of the car.
  I use the ends of the torsion bars. 
-Never work under a car supported only by a jack.
-When you are working under the car, always wear eye protection.

To change the transaxle fluid:
 1. Drive vehicle for a short distance to warm the transaxle.
 2. Remove negative lead from battery.
 3. Raise rear of car and support on jackstands
 4. remove the driver side rear wheel (not absolutely necessary,
    but it makes filling the transaxle a lot easier.
 5. Use the 17mm Allen key and remove the fill plug. The fill and
    drain plugs are located on the driver side of the transaxle.
    The top one is the fill plug, the lower one the drain plug. You
    remove the fill plug first so in case there is a problem and
    you can't remove the fill plug, you aren't stuck with an empty
    transaxle. 
 6. Use the 17mm Allen key and remove the drain plug
    (be sure to place the drain pan under the transaxle first).
 7. While the old fluid is draining, I recommend you heat the new 
    transaxle fluid in a water bath. This will make it flow faster.
 8. After all the fluid has drained, re-install the drain plug.
    The manual states 18 ft lb of torque.
 9. Insert one end of the hose into the fill hole.
10. Run the hose over the muffler and up through the rear fender.
11. Insert the funnel in hose. 
12. Pour the fresh fluid into the hose, and into the transaxle.
13. When the fluid runs out the fill hole, the transaxle case is  
    full. 
14. Put the fill plug back in, and tighten to 18 ft lb.
15. Put the wheel back on (torque lug nuts to 90 ft lb.) and shift 
    happily ever after!

Note: It might take a while to add the new fluid. You might want
to support the funnel with a chair or cart or something.

Hope this helps,
