Hello PorscheDIYers.

I have 2 concerns I would appreciate help with:

1) While changing the engine oil this past weekend, I noticed one of the fins
   on the oil pan was bent, and the fin next to it actually had part of it
   sheared off.  There is no leak there, but is this something I need to be
   concerned about replacing?  Will the pan eventually leak because of this,
   and is this something I can do myself in one morning?  I pressume I would
   have to replace whatever seals were around the pan also.

2) I have noticed that my engine temp is slightly higher now that I am running
   Mobil 1.  When I used Castrol Syntec (mineral/synthetic blend) my engine ran
   cooler.  Is this a normal consequence of using Mobil 1?  Outside temp has
   been varying around 95oF (heat index ~110oF).  Humidity has been consistantly
   higher now than in the past few months.  I don't know if humidity is a factor
   (maybe slowing down combustion? - just a ridiculously wild guess).

Anyone have any ideas about these?  Please help otherwise I'll have to repost
my message at least 500 times.  I guess I shouldn't call GPR for parts.   8~)
