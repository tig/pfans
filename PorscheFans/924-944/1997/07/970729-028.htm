Well, I finally have just about finished the process of regluing the
rear hatch on my wife's '77 924, and I though I'd relay my experiences
to the list for all those interested. (feel free to reproduce, YMMV,
etc.)

The reason for doing this (for me) was because the (aluminum) frame had
become bent and separated from the glass, preventing the cover from
closing properly. I guessed, and was basically correct, that all I'd
have to do was separate the frame from the glass, straighten the frame,
and re-glue the glass to the frame. However, I underestimated the amount
of effort it would take to separate the two.

I ended up using a _full_ tube (5 Fl. Oz.) of Permatex Black Super
Weatherstrip Adhesive (Item # 81850, Part 82). It's listed a OEM
approved (doesn't say which ones), is fast drying and high strength, and
looks like a very close if not exact match for the original glue that
was used on the hatch. It costing me US$2.99 + tax, and I used up every
last bit of it without wasting any. This not only glues the glass to the
frame, it also fills in a lot of gap in places.

I found that I could get away without having a second person handy to
manuver the hatch by exercising caution, until the time came to glue it
back, when a passersby/friend got drafted. It makes it a lot easier to
handle the hatch this way, especially when all the edges are covered in
glue.

I also found it obligatory to separate the glass from the frame in order
to be sure that I got a good seal all around.

The basic step-by-step procedure was:

1) Remove the hatch from the car (disconnect shocks, unbolt hinges from
rear of roof, as described in your Haynes manual).

2) Remove the trim clips and strips from around the edge of the hatch.
These clip onto the frame, and cover the gap between the edge of the
glass and the edge of the frame. If you flip the hatch over, you can see
some spaces where the strips can be pried off with a screwdriver.

3) Pry the glass off of the frame (or vise-versa, same difference). Not
easy, and where I spent the most time. I ended up using screwdrivers and
a knife (for cutting the old adhesive). Take your time and try not to
break the glass (though it is pretty strong).

4) Scrape off the remains of all the old sealant/adhesive (with a knife
if necessary) and clean with something like an alcohol solution or brake
cleaner, so there's no residue. I actually ended up cutting off a lot of
the old adhesive, and even ended up leaving a little bit on still (the
last bits I couldn't get to). I suppose you could try using solvents to
get the rest off, but I'm too impatient to get that. Don't forget to do
the edges of the glass, too.

5) Reinstall the frame on the car without the shocks, and close it (so
the pins are in the latches). You'll glue the glass on in place to make
sure that everything's aligned properly. BTW, make sure the frame's
straight before this :)

6) Lay an even bead of the adhesive all around the edge of the frame
where the glass sits, and all around the edge of the glass where it sits
on the frame, as per the instructions on the adhesive. Keep in mind that
when the directions say that you should let it dry, they mean let it
skin over. This takes only a minute or two. Be generous with the stuff
in the corners of the hatch (all six), because the gaps are larger there
and you need to fill them in. You should have a little bit of adhesive
left over.

6) After the adhesive has skinned over, place the glass on the frame and
push it down all around so that the adhesive gets a good grip. The way
my helper and I got the glass on the frame was: with the glass
upside-down, maneuver it so that it's behind the car with the rear edge
facing forwards. Place the rear edge of the glass in the rear of the
frame, and rotate it forwards until the front of the glass is about a
foot from being in place. Have one person hold it in place while the
other person goes inside the car and takes the weight of the glass. Then
the person outside the car pulls their hands out of the way, and the
glass is lowered into place.

7) Take what's left of the adhesive and fill in gaps around the hatch
between the glass and the frame. This'll make sure there aren't any
leaks and that you have the best adhesion possible.

8) Once the adhesive has set (I'm not sure how long, probably less than
24 hrs.) replace the trim strips and clips. It may be necessary to
unbolt the hatch briefly to do this. Also don't forget the hatch shocks.

That should do it, I've just completed mine and haven't even driven it
yet, so I'll keep you posted if I experience any problems with this.

Should this be put with the FAQs?
