It is unfortunate that you have received many an insult from list members. As 
a list member, I do not own, or have any control over the list's mail server. 
I am just another frustrated list member. My note to you was an attempt to 
find a solution to the problem, not to insult. In my experience, members of 
the 924-944 list are a decent bunch.

Good Luck in the future..
Ezra
