It you're anywhere near 6' the biggest gripe is the interior of the 924s.
Steering wheel position cuts off circulation to your upper legs!  For some
it's no big deal--I actually preferred the earlier 924-944 interiors until
I test drove them and found that controlling the car was next to
impossible.  The redesigned interiors of the 1985.5 and up 944s don't have
this problem.  The 924s is potentially a great buy, as they were dwarfed in
numbers by 944 production, but you have to consider the "dated" exterior
styling when compared to the 944 (the 944 says "80s" while the 924 still
says "70s,") as well as the interior.  What I've hear a lot of complaints
on are the round "road reflectors" on the front and rear quarter panels.
