     I received a recall notice for my 951 today. (shows the importance of 
     registering with PCNA when you buy your used Porsche). Anyway, the 
     card entitles me to a replacement of my fuel hoses and fuel rail (and 
     hopefully the injectors too). Is this a new campaign or are they just 
     catching up with un-updated cars? Have other members on the list had 
     this operation done? Did you get new injectors?

Rod/other listmembers,

call PCNA Customer Commitment Group and give them your VIN#.  They will tell
you if your car has had any and all of the recall work done.  Also, ask them
to send you a letter if the recall work has been done and you don't have the
records from the PO.  This letter will help serve as proof if you resell
your car in the future.

I don't recall the injectors being replaced on my 86 951 when this recall work
was done by the PO.  Sorry but I don't have the # handy for PCNA CCG, but you
can call 1-800-PORSCHE and they can give it to you.

Regards,

Naweed
86 951
