 I'm getting a warning light (the huuuuge one as well as the

Victoria,

Welcome to the world of Porsche ownership. The shop manuals (at least in
the U.S.) have been on backorder for about a year.  The Haynes manual is
not too bad but it will not help you with the air bag light problem.  

I think it is caused when the battery gets low.  Just disconnecting the
battery does not cause it.  One of the other list members was kind enough
to post the revised reset procedure.  When I find it in my files, I will
forward it to you.  My light is also on.

Have fun, you have one of the finest cars ever built.
