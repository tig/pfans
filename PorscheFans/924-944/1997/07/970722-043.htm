     Sorry, but this is NOT normal for any 944.  The fuel pump is "whining" 
     because its straining to deliver the fuel that's being demanded by the 
     engine.  Fuel pumps can fail, and once they start whining, they can 
     die at any moment.  So you'll either get 3 miles more out of it, or 
     30,000 miles.
     
     More likely, though, is that you're having a problem with your fuel 
     pressure regulator.  It's got to be cheaper to replace than the fuel 
     pump, so I would try and swap in a fresh unit.  Check your fuel 
     mixture to make sure you're not asking for more fuel than necessary!

I recently purchased a 944S2 with 85k miles.  The fuel pump makes quite a 
bit of noise when I first start up (loud hum).  It seems to quiet down over 
time, but perhaps this is because I get used to the sound.  I have owned an 
84 944 since new, and have never heard the fuel pump at all.  Can anyone 
tell me if such noise is characteristic of S2s?  Thanks.
