I haven't dynoed the car with the test pipe yet (I'll explain below why
it will be done on Paul's car).

The installation went smoothly.  It took the shop 1.6 hours (I would love
to work on my car myself, but I tend to get frustrated easily).  The
only problem they ran into was a rubber hanger was busted up, so they
replaced it.

When I went to pick the car up, the noise was a little loud for my tastes,
so I was entering into this thing pretty skeptical.  I drove lightly on
my way home.  I noticed immediately the throttle response was much, much
better than before.  The car burbled more too and under WOT, it sounds
like a Ferrari F355 at full chat (new word I learned from an english
list member).  

So, how does it feel?  I use this one road for testing.  It's a small
straight.  You line up at this pole and take off with a street start
launch.  When you have to brake is when I look down at the speedo to
see what speed I've hit.  Paul's car can hit 150km/h down this stretch,
but Paul brakes very deep into this bend.  When I drive his car down
the stretch, I usually hit arond 140-145km/h at the end so we'll use
my numbers as a baseline.  My car gets 140-145km/h down the stretch
too.  So, what did it hit with the test pipe?  An astonishing 155km/h!!!

My street test is actually very, very accurate, I've been able to
repeat that result over and over again.  Now, onto my next test.  I use
this road up to my house to see how fast I can hit before a very awesome
chicane.  If you get everything right on a cool night, my car would
hit 2 rev limiter pops in 2nd before I have to brake and turn-in.  On a warm
20C day (yes, it did stop raining out here!), my car would have a hard
time even hitting the limiter at all (2nd gear).  With the test pipe,
the car hit the rev-limiter FIVE times.  I felt stupid for sitting
there making all that noise.  Next time, I'm gonna go for third and
really blow the doors off Paul behind.

Would I recommend it?  You bet!  Am I going to keep it on?  No! :)
Confused?  I have made a decision to keep this my street car, I
can't let it get out of hand as it did with the last car.  I want
to build a RACE car, where compromises such as emmission are no
concern.  So, for the street car, I want to stay within 100% of the
law (except those speed laws of course).

I have already sold my test pipe to Darren Foo to try on his 87 Turbo,
so we will have a data point there when we stick it on the dyno.  *And*,
Paul, being the power mad person that he is, is going to get his put on
next week.  He loves the power, he loves the loud pops (flames?), he
loves the personality it gives it, and most importantly, he loves to
win, and this is what you will need to win.  It makes the turbo lag
reduce to such a small level that you wonder why people always said
that it doesn't make much difference.

Even if the dyno doesn't show it, this is one of those mods where the
seat of your pants can verify it definitely gives an improvement.

Be forewarned though, it does make the car louder and more racey.
But the power, oh the power, what a feeling.  I wanted to take every
car next to me on, I revved and revved and revved at every light.
I felt like a guy that was driving his Ferrari for the first time.

Farzaan.
