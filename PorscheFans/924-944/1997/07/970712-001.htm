	The only thing it *could* do is reduce spool-up time and increase throttle
response slightly but on a force-fed car it's very difficult to say. From
my experience, about all the replacment K&N do on a NA car is improve
throttle response and increase top speed by a couple of MPH.

	Many people use the "cones" but there is one humongous problem on using
them in 944's. I was looking under the hood of my new-to-me 944 which
replaced my BMW 325is ('87) and I noticed the placement of the airbox where
the cone would fit. There is very poor ventilation and I would imagine a
huge rise of intake air temperature over stock at anything below 100MPH.
Unless, we all get creative and develop some extensive heat shield and
ventiliation system for the cone. On a dyno this problem will be even worse
since the car is stationary and the cone will be eating hot air for sure.
In a turbo car this would all be essentially in vain since maximum power
will not change (unless you wastegate is turned off). The only improvement
for force-fed cars is in throttle response and ability to reach maximum
boost quicker. On normally aspirated cars, however, a well-engineered cone
system could add 5-10HP. I was looking at the intake path for my 944NA and
it seems to be very restrictive. Also, BMW was able to coax 17 more HP out
of a 2.5L 2valve six with Bosch Motronic so I think there must be a
difference in volumetric efficiency somewhere. 

	On another intake note, has anyone thought about removing their
intake-side foglight and installing a ram-air system that way? The stock
intake pipe seems to be in exactly the right place for this purpose and I
can't imagine it being too difficult. The only downsides I can see are
possible hydrolock and the loss of one foglight.
