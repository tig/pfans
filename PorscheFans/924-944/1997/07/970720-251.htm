The weather has been good around here lately, and temperatures have been
high. My car feels like an oven when it is parked in the sun, so I wound
down both windows a bit after parking it. Should be safe, I thought. It was
a joint parking lot, but surrounded by houses and people. I go to my house,
and after about ten minutes a couple of friends drop by.  We walk over to
the parking lot, and my heart starts pounding..  "Hey, did I park my car
*there*?  Did I have a blackout, or what? No, I'm sure I didn't park there!"
Looks like someone stuck their hand through the crack in the driver's side
window, unlocked the door, put the transmission in neutral, and pushed the
car backwards to the parking space opposite the one I parked in.

Luckily they didn't take anything or do any damage, they even locked the
door before leaving, but one would expect people to show a little respect
for other people's property! I guess even a 924 provokes people in Norway.
Had it been a more "normal" car, I'm sure nobody would have bothered. What
has the world come to?
