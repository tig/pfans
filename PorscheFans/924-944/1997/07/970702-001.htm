1.  Can we cut all the non-technical related stuff (e.g. personal opinions
about cars/drivers etc) - it's getting harder and harder to plough through
the list and get anything useful - no response necessary to this, let's
just all try and keep to the useful stuff.
2. Anyone know about Octane ratings and S2's - my book says I have to use
95+ Unleaded - bloody expensive here in Australia - standard is 92.  If car
is not driven hard, does it really  matter ??
3. Repeat of question re clock light - is there one, if so, how changed
(think there was some previous discussion on this one).
4. Does an 86 Turbo steering wheel fit an 89.1 NA S2 (both non-airbag) ?
5. Anyone got a problem with a heater that blows HOT air on driver's side
(RHS in Aus) and not much of anything on passenger side ??
6. Anyone got a radio which sometimes doesn't switch off when cassette
inserted ?
7. What angles are the check stops meant to stop the doors at - both mine
open almost 90 degrees with no interrupt, to the point that the trim strip
on drivers side loses paint on rear of fender (wing in English).
Thanks - answers  direct if you wish to cut down list space........

     1) Have an '87 951 which has the supplemental waterpump for the turbo. 
        When I switch the engine off this thing keeps pumping water all 
        night.. surprized the battery didn't go flat!
        Anyway when I disconnect the temperature sensor, after about 30 
        seconds the little pump switches off.
        Now then, I guess the sensor is bad; but does the fact that it 
        takes 30 seconds to switch off after I disconnect the sensor mean   
        that the relay is also suspect?
     
     
     I don't think the relay is suspect because those turbo coolant pumps 
     are supposed to run for like 10+ (30 seems a bit long though) seconds 
     after shutting the car off to make sure the turbo has a chance to 
     chill out.  Isn't it normal to hear that gurgling whine after shutting 
     off our 951's?
