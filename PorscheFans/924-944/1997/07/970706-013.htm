My original question:

>> rpm; it slowly falls to a high idle. It's not consistent, except that a
>> blip of the throttle almost always causes a return to normal idle speed

Thanks for the suggestion -- I'll check the screw to make sure it's not
leaking. Brent <serge@comptec.com> suggested I check the throttle position
sensor (on the throttle body; Porsche calls it a throttle switch). As it
turns out, light tapping on the TPS always produces a return to normal
idle, so I think I've found the problem.

I'm going to pick up a new TPS next week, but before I install it I'll see
if the old one can be taken apart and cleaned (perhaps dirty contacts?).
Anyone have any experience with this, or is the TPS simply a
replace-and-discard part?

Thanks,

-Jeff
