It appears that the water pump bearing is failing.  It is not leaking, but
there is a sound at the front of the engine that is not normal, kind of a
rattly, grating sound - somewhat subtle.  I confirmed the location by
using a short section of hose as a stethoscope.  The sound is coming from
the water pump where it emerges from under the plastic belt cover. 

The moral of this story is that this water pump is 16 months old and has 
15,000 miles on it.  What! you say.  I stupidly used a rebuilt water 
pump, since $100 was much cheaper than the $400 factory pump at that 
time.  Sigh.  Well, now I have learned.

I am getting the belts retensioned next week, so when we are in there, we
can get an accurate idea of what is going on.  For the list's information,
I purchased the rebuilt pump from Tweeks in Indianapolis, so you may want
to think hard before considering a rebuilt pump from them.  It is
warranted, but it doesn't cover the labor to R&R the pump, the major cost. 

Gregor - 89 944 2.7 with newly discovered noisy water pump.  <sigh>
