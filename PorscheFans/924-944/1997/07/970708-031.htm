My advice is to double-check the heat shields and underbelly pans,
especially if your motor mounts are suspect. On my '89 951, I heard a very
similar noise at approximately 3100 RPM, usually while accelerating. It
turns out the rearmost underbelly pan at the front of the car (the one you
remove to change the oil) was just close enough to the exhaust make contact
(and thus noise) under certain conditions.

I'm not familiar with the exahaust configuration on NA 944s, but bending
the pan just 1/2-inch was enough to stop the noise permanently on my car.
