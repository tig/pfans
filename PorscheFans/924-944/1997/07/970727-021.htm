fall. I know at anytime it is going to stop for good. I've done other

- he did  a 951 clutch. How reliable are his instructions/experiences?

My garage told me 20 hrs. labor  $1500+, I trust them but I NEED THE CASH=

I recently bought an old home in Pittsburgh that needs more work than my
Porsche.
Should I get the metal spring center spline clutch or replace it with
OEM/rubber? How are AUTOMATION's retro/turbo clutches for std 944s?

Rob,

Michael Kehr's FAQ on the clutch replacement is as good as you will find
anywhere.  It is better than both Haynes and the Porsche manual combined.=
  =


My engine builder and I replaced the clutch on my 87 951 this last weeken=
d.
 I have several recommendations that make life easier.  Find a lift to us=
e,
find someone to help who knows what the hell they are doing and have the
right tools.  The lift and anyone who has replaced a 944 clutch are hard =
to
find, so you probably will just go for the tools.  Take a trip to Sears a=
nd
spend the $1500 you saved on labor on tools instead.  Actually the tools
will cost less than that, at least your first purchase.  Universal 3/8"
drive sockets are a must in 10, 13, 15, 17 and 19mm flavors.  Get three o=
r
four assorted length 3/8" drive wobble extensions and several flexhead
ratchets.  I prefer the short one and the long one with the black handle.=

A 1/2" impact wrench is helpful on dropping the transaxle.  Make sure you=

buy a quality brand of tools.  I broke a SK 15mm socket on the exhaust
manifold.  It took two of us 12 hours each so plan accordingly.  If you
have any questions, ask Marv, he should be out of clutch shock by now or =
I
will answer what I can.

Talk to Jason at Paragon Products about a Turbo Cup clutch.
