I don't have the tech specs in front of me but I don't think the S bars are that
big. I think the plain (!) turbo has 23.5mm bars. Going to 28mm bars _doubles_
the spring rate at the rear. I imagine the S bars are no larger than 24mm or 25mm.

FWIW, I have the 250# springs front and 28mm bars rear and with bigger anti-roll
bars it is a nicely balanced package. Certainly you will see a big decrease in
understeer from the situation you have now (BTDT).

I have LSD so I don't have any first-hand experience with increasing the rear
spring rate on a non-LSD model, but I think larger torsion bars would serve to
increase traction on a non-LSD car (by keeping both rear tires planted). I say
this because the anti-roll benefits of increased rear spring rate do not come
at the cost of lifting the inner wheel (as in the case of stiffer anti-roll bars).
