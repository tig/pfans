This post is a followup to a request for help in finding the drain plug.

I found it!  It is an M8 bolt with thread sealer on it.  Unfortunately, the
three Alfa Romeo drain plugs with magnesium anodes have M13.5x1.5mm,
M16x1.5mm and M21x1.5mm threads and therefore cannot be fitted.

I am in the process of replacing all of the coolant hoses.  I read somewhere
that the heater valve or attached hose leaks have caused clutch replacement
and that relocation is recommended.  I read that later cars have the valve
near the oil filter but there is no confirmation in the exploded view catalog
or in the Parts and Technical Reference Catalog.  I also couldn't find an
applicable Technical Service Bulletin.

Please advise if you have a Porsche relocated valve or if you have done your
own modification.  Now is the time for me to move it.

TIA, Claus
