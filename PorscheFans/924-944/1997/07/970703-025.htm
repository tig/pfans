If you're talking mainly about a standing start or shifting at low rpms, I
had the same experience w/ a late '85 944.  It seemed to bog on a standing
start.  Two things that helped were (1) the circular cam throttle that
makes the same throttle pedal depression open the throttle plate faster,
and (2) an Autothority chip.  The chip doesn't do anything (or very little)
for overall power, but it does seem to help torque below 4000 rpm.  Plus it
gives you a soft rolloff at higher rpms.  If you want the chip, check
around for prices.  EBS gave me a better deal than Autothority.

If your problem is a real shutter indicating a clutch problem, ignore this
advice until you get that problem solved.

     While many members of this list have experienced problems with Ron and 
     Eurospeed, I have found him quite professional and his prices 
     competitive.  While other parts suppliers were quoting me $250 to $600 
     for REBUILT Bosch 951 alternators with 30-day to 30-month warranties 
     PLUS $75-150 in core charges, Ron hooked me up with a PorscheFans 
     discount and only charged me $149 for a rebuilt alternator with a 
     LIFETIME warranty (important for car stereo buffs) with an almost 
     negligible core charge.
        Also, I asked him if he was a listmember and if he had read the 
     thread about his "questionable" service a few weeks back.  He said he 
     was not aware of it because he is only subscribed to the General and 
     911 lists, but that his concerned customers and friends on this list 
     had later called him to tell him about it.
        I don't work for Eurospeed, and I'm only trying to provide a 
     different perspective that may help balance the horrible experiences 
     some of the others have endured.  Ron and Eurospeed are A-okay in my 
     book, so far at least.
     
     Ben

Can you let me know through private email fkassam@direct.ca any experiences 
with Eurospeed.  I remember reading something about Eurosomething giving 
some problems to list members, but there are so many euro- companies that 
it's hard to remember which are which.
