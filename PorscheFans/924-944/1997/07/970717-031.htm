To the six people who have read this message earlier this week I apologize.

To all of the others who can help me out Thanks In Advance.

I have a repeat problems with a few things on my '86 951.

First - The heat is stuck on full again.  I can control the fan speed but not
the tremendous amount of heat coming through the ducts.  I checked the
factory service manuals but they give me no solutions.  It says something is
wrong with one of the three sensors (interior, exterior, and mixing chamber)
but I don't know how to test them.  I pulled the heat/AC controls out of the
dash earlier this evening and cleaned the contacts on the three large
connectors.  No change.

The A./C switch also does not stay in the on position.  When I press and hold
it the compressor kicks in.  When I let go the compressor turns off.
 Sometimes the air gets cold and sometimes the air stays *very* hot.  Does
anyone think I need to replace the control unit on the dash?  Or one or more
of the three sensors?

Second - I had my D40M2's re-balanced again today.  But I still have an
ocassional shimmy in the 60-70 mph range.  My rims are not bent, and I see
and feel no bubbles in the tread area on the front tires.  I have had bad
experiences with Dunlops before.  On one occasion the tread peeled off the
passenger side rear tire at about 110 mph.  The tread consequently peeled the
paint off the quarter panel.  Any suggestions on how to get rid of this
shimmy?  Alignment, bushings, Turbo-cup suspension?  I am ready to try just
about anything.  When I put my R-1's on for Sunday's auto-x I'll know if it
is the tires/rims.  Last time the (since re-balanced) R-1's were installled
the shimmy was still there.

Third - My driver's side wiper washer fluid does not work.  I tried to clear
the holes in the "squirter" with a pin.  No luck.  The passenger side works
fine.  The hoses are not kinked or otherwise obstructed in the hood.

Thanks much for any assistance.
