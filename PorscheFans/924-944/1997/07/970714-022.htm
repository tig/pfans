It should be a very straightforward conversion, and should take
less than 1 hour. (more like 30 minutes)

Here are the basic steps:
1. Remove old refridgerant:
   You are supposed to have an approved shop remove the old stuff
so it doesn't escape to atmosphere. I've heard that some people
just use a screwdriver to press the schrader valve, and vent the
old stuff that way.

2. Charge the system with 2 cans of new refridgerant.

3. Add oil to the sytem.

4. drive down the road with the windows up and the a/c blasting
out cold air.

Here are the details:

I bought a kit that contained a valve and hose assembly for charging
the system, 2 new connectors for the schrader type valves on the car,
and 2 cans of R134A. I had to buy 2 cans of compressor oil. Total cost
was less than $40.  The valve - hose assembly is made up of a valve
that screws onto the R134A can, and a hose that connects to the valve.
The other end of the hose has a quick connect fitting for attaching to
the car. The valve contains a pin that punctures the can when you turn
it.

You have to find and differentiate between the high pressure valve
and the low pressure valve. On 87+ cars, the low pressure valve is
located near the compressor. The high pressure valve is located on
a line near the strut mount. You don't do anything with the high
pressure valve. The kit contained 2 adapters that you thread onto
the schrader valves. Mine didn't fit the high pressure valve (it
was too small) but since you don't do anything with that, I didn't
care. You thread the low pressure adapter on the valve.

Once all old refridgerant is removed, you screw the valve onto the can
of refridge. Make sure the pin is all the way up in the valve. Next,
connect the hose the low pressure valve with the quick connect. Screw
the pin into the can, opening the can, then up to allow the refridge to
flow into the system. Now start the car and turn the a/c full on. The
can of refridge should get cold and then empty in a few seconds.

After the can is empty, remove the quick connect from the low pressure
valve, remove the hose from the empty can, and then repeat for the
next can of R134a, then the two cans of oil.

That's basically it!

Some other important notes:

I was able to access the low pressure valve by putting the car up on
ramps. Believe it or not, I didn't have to remove the undertrays,
there was enough room to get my hand in there. 

I had a number of problems that all stemmed from one problem.
The kit that I bought contained the valve that screwed onto the can.
One side of the valve connected to the can, the other to a hose that
threaded onto the valve. That side of the valve contained a schrader
valve. There was nothing in the hose that threaded onto that side
of the valve that could open the schrader valve. Therefore, I could
never get the refridgerant to flow into the system. First, I thought
it was because the low pressure switch prevented the compressor from
cycling on, and drawing the R134 into the system. After I found and
jumped the low pressure switch, and got the compressor to go on, 
I still couldn't get the R134A into the system. Next I thought that
perhaps the adapter on the low pressure inlet valve wasn't on all
the way (I just threaded it on hand tight), so I used pliers and
really screwed it on. Still no R134 into the system. Finally, I took
a close look at everything, and realized that something was wrong with
the kit I had. I called my brother, who did the conversion on his car
a week before, and found out that his kit did not contain that scrader
valve in the output of the valve that connected to the can of R134A.
Once I removed that valve (with 2 small screwdrivers) I was able to
get the R134A to flow into the system. Then, when I removed the quick
connect from the low pressure inlet valve, the refridgerant came
blasting out! I had screwed the adapter on too tight, and that forced
the valve to be open all the time. 

So don't screw the adapter on too tight, hand tight is good enough.

I think that if you fill the system with the can upside down, it will
flow faster, and the pressure in the can will open the low pressure
switch, so you should not have to jumper the switch.

That's about it.
