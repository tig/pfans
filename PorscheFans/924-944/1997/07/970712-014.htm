Porsche Fans -

First, thanks for all the great advice. I bought the '88 944S on 7/2/97 
and it's been wonderful. 141K miles so far. I'll never buy anything other 
than a Porsche ever again for a my personal ride.

I have another tech/newbie question. I drove my Porsche all day today 
(what fun!) without any problems, but when I stopped tonight for 
groceries and started the car again, the oil light came on. I quickly 
glanced at the oil pressure gauge, and it was reading normal. I turned 
the car off, started it again, watched the pressure come up to normal, 
then decided to drive it the rest of the way home (4 miles). No problems, 
no increase in temperature, etc, though I was very paranoid and mistook 
every pebble in the road for engine vibration that signalled meltdown.

The airbag warning light has been on since I've had it (about 500+ miles) 
so I'm not sure the dash warning lights aren't going funky on me. The 
current odo reading is 141K. Oil looks fresh (light honey colored) and 
seems to be topped off properly. Oil changes have been every 3000 miles 
according to the maintenance records.

Pressure seems to stay at 4-5 on the highway...drops down to 3 or so at 
idle...a bit less if idling in heat for a long time.

Could it be a faulty pressure switch? A short? Or is there some sort of 
odd "oil change needed" thingey that comes on every so often (I don't 
have an owner's manual yet).

Thanks,
Victoria Deaton
