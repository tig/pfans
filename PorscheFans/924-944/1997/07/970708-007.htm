Two weeks ago I replaced the windshield of my 1983 944. It is not
difficult, but it takes some time and you have to be very precise.
Remove the wipers, it is not necessary to remove the hood. Remove on the
inside of the car the covers of the roof pillars left and right after
removing the plastic plugs and the phillipshead screws. Remove on the
outside all the alluminium pieces, framing the windshield left, right and
top by pulling them upward from their clips.
Take care to pull carefully just above the clips, otherwise you will bent
them. You can leave the clips in place unless they are corroded and you
want to do something about it.
Take a good look at the position of the windshield and take some
measurements of distances between windshield and frame left, right and top
and how the windshield rests on the two plastic supports at the bottom and
weather it is flush with these supports and the distance beween windshield
and frame (thickness of adhesive).
Remove the plastic supports (each two phillipshead screws).
Buy the correct adhesive, primer and degreaser and special square metal
wire to cut through the old adhesive to remove the old windshield. Cover
your dash. Tie the wire to some support inside the car, route wire between
glass and frame to the outside (topside is easiest), guide it all around
the windshield on the outside and guide it back into the car at the place
where it was guided to the outside. Cut the glass from the frame by pulling
on the wire from the inside. Wrap the wire around a pair of pliers to
prevent cutting your fingers. You will need someone the help guiding the
wire around the corners while you pull. Lift the glass out of the frame.
Remove every part of adhesive from the frame, it is very important that
everything is removed. This will take time, but do it right. Use
razorblades, chisels, whatever it takes. You will damage some paint, but
that is not important because you will prime that aerea and cover it with
adhesive later. Use some sandingpaper to remove the last parts of the
adhesive, degrease the frame amd apply primer to it. If you are using a new
windshield you only have to degrease it. the primer is already there
(black). If you are using a used windshield you have to remove the adhesive
as metacuously as on the frame and degrease it, the black primer should
still be intact. Now it is time to put a new adhesive layer to the frame.
There should be a nozzle with the adhesive to lay a triangular (on
crosssection) band of adhesive around the frame pointing upwards (away from
the frame) and about 1 cm thick. Take care, because this is a point of no
return and no adjustments are possible anymore. The position of the band of
adhesive in relation to the position of the windshield to the frame is very
important. Remember the distance of the original windshield to the frame
left, right and top. Install the two plastic supports at the bottom of the
frame.
Now you will need two extra hands. Lift the windshield left and right and
hold it in position just in front of the frame. Do not touch the degreased
area of the glass. Align carefully left and right spacing to frame and
lower the bottom part on the two plastic supports. Support the glass from
the inside and slowly let it rest on the band of adhesive. Take care of
alignment, because it is almost impossible to shift the windshield once it
is in position on the adhesive. Now very carefully press the windshield
into the adhesive untill it is in the same position as the original
windshield. I mean distance beween glass and frame (thicknes of adhesive
layer). This is what you should be looking for before removing your old
windshield. The thickness of the adhesive layer is very important. Do not
press to far. You cannot correct this anymore and when the layer of
adhevsive is to thin it will not cushion your windshield and it will
fracture. Put your alluminium framing parts in place by pushing them down
into the clips. Do it directly because some of the adhesive will be in the
way and it is still flexible. Do not move the car for at least 24 hours to
let the adhesive harden. To harden correctly it needs a temperature of more
then 15 degrees Celcius and some humidity.
I hope all is clear. If not E-mail me directly. Success.
Peter
