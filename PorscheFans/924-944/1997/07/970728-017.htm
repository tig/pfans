Greetings all,

Well, as usual, the week I take off to go on vacation is the week when
all hell breaks loose.  The membership lists for some of the lists got
corrupted, and the repeating mail message problem came back.

REPEATING MESSAGE:

To try and resolve the repeating message, the account generating the
message has been BANNED from posting to the list.  My apologies to
fahlgren@worldnet.att.net for being the victim of crappy software and
dueling mail servers.  When this clears up, I'll be happy to reinstate
you.  I can make arrangements for you to continue getting the digests. I
will e-mail you separately.

When a repeating message ends up in a list, it is the fault of the mail
servers involved.  Whether their server doesn't get the message that
an email has been received, or ours doesn't indicate correctly that it
is received is unknown.  So don't flame the sender of the message. It
ain't their fault. And if you do feel like flaming someone, that's what
the Flamers forum is for.  OK?  Flaming in the other lists is not
allowed, and you will be banned from posting.  Applications for
volunteer whistle-blowers are being accepted.

MEMBERSHIP LIST CORRUPTED:

As for the corrupted membership lists, I've got a backup that I'll merge
back into the current membership lists in the next few days.

Why?  Beats me.  The only thing I can think of is that the mail server
crashed while updating the membership lists.  I do back up the membership
lists every day, but each day's backup overwrites the previous day's
backup.  At this point don't have any automatic historical records beyond
the previous day (and some semi-frequent backups). Something else that's
been on the to-do list awhile...

If you think you got bumped, just resubscribe.  Please don't e-mail me
asking to check if you're a member, or to add you back in.  If you try
to subscribe when you're already a member, it will just tell you "You're
already a member".  I don't have time to do it for you, and generally
just delete the requests, unless it is someone really having a problem. 
The PorscheFans web site has a really easy to use subscription form.
Please use it.  http://www.porschefans.com/Subscribe.html

Last note on memberships.  Getting every message as it is received puts
a big load on the server.  Please consider if you REALLY need that much
mail, or if you can make do with the digest.  At some point, I may
switch EVERYONE to digest mode, and let you switch yourself back if you
want the messages that bad.  Especially AOL members -- their mail
servers are always overloaded, and mail takes a long time to get through.

POSTING AND ADVERTISING:

Effective immediately, only members will be allowed to post to the lists.
There's been too much crap being posted into the lists.  I'm also going
to take a stand on spamming: it IS NOT ALLOWED -- except from me.  I
need to build a means of covering some of the costs of this operation,
and only PorscheFans authorized advertising will be allowed.  E-mail me
at listmaster@porschefans.com if you're interested in advertising to
PorscheFans members or in putting up a ad on the web site.  We can even
develop and host your site under PorscheFans.

To those that hate the advertising, I agree with you.  I don't like it
either -- but I accept the fact that you can't get something for nothing,
and I live with it.  You won't be bombarded.  As those two guys selling
wine coolers used to say, "Thank you for your support."

To all of you that have been patient -- Thank You.  I want these lists
to run well.  There have been several people that have contributed to
maintaining the service, and I appreciate their assistance.

As always, your feedback is appreciated.

Subject: Re[2]: Clutch judder
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I sometimes get this clutch judder in my 951, but only on hot days 
     when traffic is heavy.  But I have the spring centered clutch--are 
     both designs susceptible to this "judder?"

Unfortunately, you are a victim of the infamous rubber center clutch.  My 
clutch does the same thing on hot days, sitting in traffic or otherwise 
keeping the clutch heated for a long period of time.  The next day, or 
after a drive on the freeway, the clutch cools and the judder goes away. 
However, the shaking isn't violent on my car, so your rubber center may 
be starting to deteriorate, despite the ample presence of clutch lining.
     
This is caused by the rubber softening with heat, which then allows a 
rhythmic (harmonic) vibration with the drive shaft, which has a slight 
amount of flex itself.  If the rubber has separated in places, the 
symptoms are worse.  My clutch is about 40 percent worn as well, but 
otherwise works fine unless it gets really hot.
     
If this problem is chronic, the clutch can be replaced with a spring 
centered unit.  However, the engagement isn't quite as silky and cushioned 
as the rubber centered unit.  It is possible the factory has improved the 
rubber centered unit, but someone else with more information than I may 
want to verify here.
