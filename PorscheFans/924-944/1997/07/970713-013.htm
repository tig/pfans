Dear Collective:

	This is still "preliminary" meaning I have not driven an hour yet, but
the 951's engine seems to be rebalanced to full warp capability.  Please
store in file area 944FAQ, species 1071, Borg CPU node
89758932832543631, assimilation completed. 
	If you will recall, I was having a problem with the engine shutting
down at full throttle, and here is what I did to solve the problem.

1) Replaced Throttle Position Sensor - no effect
2) Replaced DME Control Unit and Knock Regulator Control Unit - no
effect
3) Cleaned engine - no effect (pleasure is irrelevant)
4) Removed air intake, air filter, vacuum lines
5) Cleaned electrical connections to air flow sensor 
6) Tightened upper radiator hose clamp because mechanic, who told me
computers were bad who told me TPS was bad who told me radiator was bad,
who did radiator F&F did not tighten hose clamp.  Mechanic will be
assimilated.  There is a shortage of waste recycler drones, assign new
drone to waste detail.  Drone not to be allowed to repair anything.
7) Re-assembled air intake system
8) Started car
9) Car smoked 3 minutes, engine cleaning fluid burning off exhaust
pipes.
10) Engine at operating temperature
11) Car exceeded 1.8 bar boost and speed limit 3 times within 10
minutes, no engine roughness noted, no engine power loss.

	I'll try an extended run tomorrow, but so far the car is running better
than it has since January when purchased.  If it holds up tomorrow I
will be happy, though poorer (money is relevant).  So, if your car is
running rough at full throttle, clean the air flow sensor connector and
cable connector first.  You might just save yourself a lot of money.

	Sincerely:

	Dana Kincaid
