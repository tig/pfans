Thanks to all for responding to my question about the the 924s and its
advantages/disavantages compared to the 944.  Following is an abreviated version
of the many responses I've recieved since posting that question.

The 924s is comparable to the 85 and lower 944.  Minus the fender flares, it
doesn't accomodate the wider tires that the 944's do, resulting in less
cornering ability (mostly needed only in autocross or track use).  The flares
are also a much contested asthetic issue, like all questions of taste will be
left up to the individual owner.  The 924s has a performance advantage based on
lighter weight, shorter gearing and several listers claimed higher compression,
though others contested that.  The 85.5 and up 944 has improved/updated
interior, better seating, better air conditioning and front suspension
improvements.  Some listers complained about the steering wheel on the 924s
cutting off circulation in their thighs.  While others called the air
conditioning useless in climates like mine in Orlando.  Still, several owners of
the 924s told me that this was simply not true, so who knows.

Every 924s owner that responded loved their cars,  several are now 951 owners,
but remember their 924s fondly.   So the moral of the story is......Like
everything else in life we each must make up our own minds, but like everything
Porsche in life, they're all nice cars.

Thanks to all the people who responded.  I'm still looking for a water pumper
that isn't owned by a redneck named bubba who tells me "Aw no man...these here
german cars never had power steering in them".   Actually happened twice.

I've looked at dozens of cars in the last couple months, and I must say it's
getting pretty damn old.  Like today for instance....  SELLER: "It has a little
ding in the left rear and one on the front, other than that it's a pristine
car"  REALITY: The left rear was side swiped, two feet long, two inches deep,
the headlight wouldn't go down (front caved in), spoiler is junk, bumper is
ruined, interior is shredded, and to top it off....IT WOULDN'T START!!!!    Not
my idea of a 'little ding'.    It's either that or "we're asking $9850 for our
nice condition '84 944.  Uh, that's twice the book value.  Well, we really don't
want to sell it anyway, so if we can get that we'll sell otherwise we won't.
Oh brother.

Frustrated,
Bill
