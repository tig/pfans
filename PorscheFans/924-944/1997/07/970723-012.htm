I have been lurking on this list for some time now. I purchased an 1987 944
about two weeks ago. This car has a badly leaking power steering rack. I
figured I could replace it myself, so I purchased the Haynes manual and a
rebuilt steering rack. The instructions in the Haynes manual seemed simple
enough, but I was stuck on a couple of things.

1. How do I remove the tie rod end from the steering knuckle. The Haynes
manual talks about a castellated nut, and not to remove this nut... but if
this is the case, I don't understand how the knuckle can be removed from
the tie-rod. (BTW, I don't know what castellated means). Is it possible
that my car has a different design than the car in the manual?

2. How do you remove the tie rods from the steering rack? There seems to be
a large nut on the end of the steering rack, but I can't seem to unscrew it
one way or another?

Thanks for any help you can give me.

BTW, I have been enjoying my car immensely. So far I have taken it to two
autocrosses and have had a great time.

If possible, please try to respond to my email as well as the mailing list,
because I have been having problems receiving from the mailing list.
