> Hi Everyone;
>
>    I'm hoping some of you might be able to
> shed some light on a few items for me. Any
> advice, help, opinions, or words of wisdom
> are most welcome! These items unfortunately
> all seem to be a bit beyond the Haynes manual
> that I have, so I cannot really dignose whats
> going on. Also, does anybody know if the
> Porsche 944 service manuals are now available
> anywhere? (Automotion, Porsche, etc)
>
> Car:
> 1986 Porsche 944NA
> 40000 Miles
> Stored for 1.5 years (engine run fairly
> regularly)
> Very good condition in appearance
> All belts and brakes changed before storage
> No accidents, just not driven much recently
>
> Problems:
> 1.  A/C on/off switch refuses to stick down
> in the on position (lights up OK if held
> down, and hear lots of clicks, etc) Do I need
> to replace whole A/C control panel? Anybody
> seen this problem, can switch be fixed
> perhaps?
>
> 2.  A/C does not blow cold air, any advice on
> Freon/R134 issues? Any known problems with
> compressors, etc? This one is probably going
> to need professional attention, but the more
> I know, the better I will feel!
>
> 3.  Central Door locks do not function. When
> the dash switch is pressed, I hear a relay
> click; the red warning light works as I
> believe it should, but nothing happens to the
> door buttons on either side. Same scenario
> when I lock the drivers door with the key, I
> get a relay clicking, but nothing happens.
>
> 4. How hard is it to change motor mounts? Do
> you have to dismantle the whole car, or is it
> feasable to do this job on jack stands in a
> garage without having to spend days on it?
> (normal tools, normal skills etc)
>
> 5. Electric hatch release only seems to
> release one side of the catches. Note that
> this is probably likely an adjustment of the
> pins, or perhaps it might be due to the fact
> that the hatch struts are dead, and the hatch
> does not pop up at all when released.
> Opinions?
>
> Many, Many Thanks;
