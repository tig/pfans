Hi Folks,

Thanks to all who responded to my post yesterday about my rear hatch woes.
I think I know what needs to be done.  EPOXY is the answer my friends.  You
gotta make that $2000 piece of glass a stressed member!  It's a scary thought,
but apparently that's the way it was designed.  If anyone out there knows
differently, please speak out now or a lot of us will be looking for some
very expensive glass in the near future.

Special thanks to Mike Fields for reposting the info from the June, 1991 issue 
of Porsche Panorama, where John Paterek wrote 

     "...This is probably caused by letting the hatch fly up against the 
      stop rather than restraining it by hand.  Epoxy sealant bonds the 
      glass to the aluminum frame and after years of use, the hinges bind 
      due to lack of being lubricated.  The frame breaks off, lifts the 
      glass, causes the leak and soon becomes inoperable."  

HOWEVER, I have to disagree with brother John's theory about the failure mode, 
at least in my case.  I rarely opened the hatch between the time I replaced the 
lifting struts and the time I noticed the glass was separating from the frame 
near the hinges.  I might have opened the rear hatch two or three times in those 
three months and I never let the hatch fly up against the stop.  After wrestling 
with the new struts to get those tight suckers on, I immediately noticed that 
the hatch lifted very quickly but it also had a cushion effect at the top of the 
lift, a sort of hydraulic restriction in the strut in the last few inches of the 
lift.  I doubt that binding hinges are in any way responsible for my hatch 
separation.  The frame near the hinges is not twisted, but pulled forward away 
from the glass; no doubt the equal but opposite result of the 200 or so pounds 
of rearward force that the new struts are putting on the metal frame while the
hatch is closed.

Anybody know what the "factory force" should be from these struts when they are
fully retracted?  Over time they lose this force until they are eventually
unable to lift the rear hatch at all.  I'll reserve comment on the source of
my new struts, but they were certainly not from my local por$che dealer.  They
did have a "944 ### ###" part number, so I felt safe installing them on my 931.

Thanks again for all the info.  This group is great.  I'll be looking for some
black two-part Devcon epoxy.  If that doesn't work I'll go with JB Weld.  It's
a metallic looking two-part epoxy that I once used to repair a frozen/cracked 
block on a 250 c.i. straight-6 I/O boat motor.  That was two years ago and the 
25-year-old motor is still going strong.
