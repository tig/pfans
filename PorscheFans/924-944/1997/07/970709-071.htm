Just a thought about the K&N air filter thread...

I've had the pleasure of having aviation as
a career (yeah, my other ride can do M.52, but
it's not as easy to park!) and having seen the 
manifold pressure on piston aircraft has helped 
me understand some of what's going on.

If you look at any N/A engine you will find some 
pressure drop through the intake track.  All this caused
by filters, butterfly shafts, intake turns etc.  An engine
will pull about 28-29 inches of HG at sea level at max power
and that will drop about 1" Hg for every 1000 ft altitude.
That leaves a NA 944 with about 125 hp at Denver.

A few NA aircraft, mainly Mooney, have ram air doors
for use in the clean air of altitude. Bypassing the filter at 
aircraft speed of about 145 knots, it will raise the MP
about one inch of pressure!

More pressure>More Flow>More Horsepower!

A supercharged/turbo engine will benefit from this also
UNLESS it has an auto-wastegate.

For our 951's, you can remove all the meter,
filter, ducting etc and will only get what the wastegate
will allow.  In fact, unless you make some other mods
to run higher boost, even a larger turbo will have little
effect on max boost/HP. 

Also a severely restricted intake (ie said SOCK!) will
limit the max boost level and power output.
(a .3-.4 bar drop) NO DON'T TRY THIS!     ;-)

My only surprise with the Dyno Day tests is that the 
drilled cycle valve cars (no wastegate bypass in effect)
I would think would show some improvement in max boost
with the K&N.  I am confused by the comment of dialing
in the car at 14-15 psi...

If the valve is drilled, what is controlling max boost? 
Or is this all the turbo can produce?

Although a NA 944 might benefit from a less restricting
air filter, for a 951 with an operating wastegate the K&N
is a waste of money.
