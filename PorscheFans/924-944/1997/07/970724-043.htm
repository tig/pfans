Hi Porsche fans.
I have owned an '87 944 for a year and I love it. =
It has 95K but you would never know it to see it. =
My wife hates it.
When she drives the Porsche she loves it and doesn't want to give it back. =
Her car is a 20V Audi Quattro (talk about power vs. displacement!).
I have also owned a 70 VW beetle, an Audi 5000cs Turbo and a 4000 Quattro. =

I have worked on every car I owned but the 944 clutch project I'm thinking =
about doing seems too involved. I need to replace the clutch sometime this =
fall. I know at anytime it is going to stop for good. I've done other =
clutches on less complex cars.

Can anyone tell me to just bite the bullet and do it myself (any tips). =
I checked out the clutch replacement on the net by Michael Kehr(very =
thorough - he did  a 951 clutch. How reliable are his instructions/=
experiences?

My garage told me 20 hrs. labor  $1500+, I trust them but I NEED THE CASH. =
I recently bought an old home in Pittsburgh that needs more work than my =
Porsche.
Should I get the metal spring center spline clutch or replace it with OEM/=
rubber? =
How are AUTOMATION's retro/turbo clutches for std 944s?

Also transmission oil, should I change it? =
It's kind of noisy when I'm off the gas and coasting around 30mph in 3rd =
or 2nd.
I've seen recos on trans/diff oils. What is the best?

1 more.
Can any place such as local parts stores turn rotors for Porsches?

Thanks
