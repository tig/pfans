I would agree with Jim on the time estimate for engine rebuild. 
I started mine with several weekends of pondering, looking at this
formidable beast of an engine, crawling under: Should I do it or should I
cart it to the dealer as a tradein (on a trailer).
Finally, I took the first 10mm socket to the 1st bolt, and there was no
going back.
Weekend after weekend with a toothbrush and degreaser finally had
everything spotlessly clean in 10 rubbermaid boxes in hundeds of varying
sizes of ziplocs (2 2 gallon for the crank, head, etc)

Then comes the money: Well I have it apart, lets just replace this. Bang
$100.

Finally the anticipation of initial startup. No dice. Recheck all
connectors. Refit loose flywheel pickup. Try again. It lives ! Smoke
endlessly poors off the engine. Finally, it stops as all the gaskets seat,
and residuals burnoff. She purrs. Final tunings. Runs like a champ.

Start to finish: 3 months
Cost:             > $6000
Outside work: Machine shop, AC recharge, Realign.
Other work:    Me and my devoted wife.
