Strange as it may seem, I agree in principle with your shop.   It sounds
like a classic
case of vapor lock.   In a hot gas line, fuel must remain under pressure or
it will boil
into vapor.   Fuel pumps will not pump vapor, nor will injectors spray it.
Hence,
vapor lock.   The condition will persist until the temperature goes down
long enough
for the vapor to condense to liquid.   You have trouble starting after the
fuel has sat
in a hot engine for a while, yet you  don't have trouble in the morning.
Perfectly
logical.

I do not necessarily agree that the check valve is the only source of a
pressure loss.
The 944S also has a fuel pressure regulator and a pressure dampener (on opposite
ends of the fuel rail) which can both go bad and fail to retain pressure, as
can injectors
themselves sometimes.   So, I agree that you have a pressure problem, which
is leading to vapor lock, but I think there are additional suspects.

Good luck.
