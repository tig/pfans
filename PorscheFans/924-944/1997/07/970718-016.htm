Hi, Porsche Fans--

I'm taking my 83 NA 944 in to have the waterpump replaced (it doesn't
seem to need it yet, but after 149,000 miles and no hard evidence that it
has ever been replaced (I got the car 3 years ago with 104,000 on it)
and it seeming to run just a schooch hot, I have decided to go ahead and
do it since the belts need changing anyway.  I am going to have the
dealer do it all (yeah, I'm a wuss). 

Questions:

What pump should I get?  All the genuine Porsche pumps are rebuilt, I
guess.  The dealer shows two pumps (neither of which is a 951 #), one
is an "upgrade" I guess which requires $75 worth of "upgrade parts" to
go with it.  Does it matter which one I use?

What other things can be done at the same time, especially to save labor
$?  Is the O2 sensor easier to get at during pump replacement?

I'm having it done Monday and won't have access to e-mail over the
weekend, so if you could get back to me pretty quickly, I would really
appreciate it.

Suspension:

If I could get a whole 951 suspension set up (yellow Konis, springs, f&r
sway bars), would they fit easily (no mods) on my car?  Would the rear
sways require a mounting plate?  Or would it require so much modifying
that it would not be cost effective?  

TIA--James
