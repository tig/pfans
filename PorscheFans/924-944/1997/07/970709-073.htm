The inside door handle is piece of cake to remove. Pull the handle back, and
you can pry the plastic cover under the handle out with a flat screwdriver.
What do you know..  There's that infamous screw!  :)

The *exterior* door handles on the other hand.. Haynes says that they can be
replaced without removing the door panels. Utter bullshit.

Mine also had zero - ZERO - rust. But it still leaked water. Don't know how,
but some polyurethane cured it..
