Hello everyone,

I'm going to the Potomac PCA Driver's Ed event at Watkins Glen this
weekend and I have a question or two for folks with more experience. 
This is my first driver's ed.  What has me the most concerned is driving
the 8+ hours up there only to find that I wish I'd brought some tool
from home.  What are things you'd suggest I remember to pack?  I imagine
10 and 13mm box ends are a must as well as a couple extra quarts of
oil.  What else?  

I'm not too concerned about having to do any makeshift repairs.  Car is
well behaved and it's condition belies its mileage (324,500 miles). 
I've got new retensioned T and Bal belts, new water pump and t-stat, new
oil, air, and fuel filters, and new brake fluid and coolant.  It has
passed the tech inspection and needed only to have a wheel bearing
tightened.  

Clothing also has me scratching my head a bit.  I have a proper helmet. 
But for my body I'm concerned about the heat.  Is there anything more
comfortable than jeans?  I thought I'd wear sneakers, jeans, and a long
sleeve cotton button-down shirt.  

I'll be grateful for any suggestions.  Please reply to me directly.
TIA  Dave Cherry
