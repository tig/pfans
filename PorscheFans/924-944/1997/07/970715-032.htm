	My 87 944S has always cosumed oil, but lately it seems to do so to an
alarming degree (my impression is 1 quart per 1000 miles or more!).  I have
no noticeable smoke, and the engine runs fine. Oil pressure is fine and
there is no oil underneath. I am going to start monitoring level by the
dipstick starting tomorrow as I have been relying on the warning light up
til now.  Is it possible to have a malfunction in the warning light
system??  

	When the diptstick is at max, I have no problems.  However, if the oil
level is less than max, it seems, the warning light will come on once the
engine is warm if I drive a short distance, make a quick stop, and start
her up again.  Sometimes, a mere splash of oil will cause the light to go
out.  It will always go out if I let the car sit for a while.  I have
always had the light come on if I sit with the engine running and the hand
brake on.  In the past, I have simply been content to add oil when the
light starts its act, but lately this has been happening with unnerving
frequency.

	All ideas will be appreciated.  The car has 104,000 miles.
