I have a 1988 944 with about 33K miles.  Recently, the warm weather 
finally made it up to northern New York (the real NNY, above the 
Adirondacks).  After a 100 or so mile trip to Burlington VT, I 
started to get some cold water on the passengers's side.  Gave my 
wife a real rush.  I check all of the drains on the "catch-all" just 
under the hood and everything was clear and dry.  While in Burlington 
I stopped at a dealer and they said that one of the drains to the AC 
was plugged and the console had to be removed to fix it.  After I 
blanched at the cost, they offered that some people have had luck 
pushing a wire up the drain tube from underneath.  Both alternatives 
sound potentially expensive.  Has anyone had the same experience, 
with some advice?
