It's possible to repair stone chips so that they can barely be seen, but it
takes a lot of practice (and skill) to do it correctly. I once found a FAQ
on the web which outlined the procedure; I don't have a URL handy but I'll
see if I can't find it for you.

If you have a number of chips to repair it might be cost-effective to take
the car to a professional -- either a body shop or a reputed detailer who
has experience repairing stone chips.

Some people simply repaint the front of their car to eliminate all the
stone chips in one fell swoop. If your paint isn't too faded, matching
shouldn't be too difficult for a good paint shop. My car was done this way
and it sure is nice to see a *perfect* front end.

I use Lexol cleaner and conditioner, but I've heard from several others
who've had good experience with Eagle One.
