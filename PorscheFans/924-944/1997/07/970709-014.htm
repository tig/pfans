Bill,

I recently purchased a 924S myself.   It is an 1988 Special Edition.
I'll explain that later.

Basically the differences are in the body and interior which are from
the original 924.  However, like the 944, the 924S has the power options
(windows, locks, mirrors, antenna, rear wiper), the 944 phone dial
alloys and a sunroof.  The engine and drivetrain are from the late 944
('85.5 and up) but not all of the suspension.  I'm not exactly sure what
the differences are here but most of it is from the earlier 944 ('85 and
below).  The air conditioning system is also from the the earlier 944.
Some say this was a mistake, but I have no qualms with it.

The 924S is faster than the 944.  It has a lower coefficent of drag.  It
was originally brought to the US to compete with the Japanese sports car
market (Supra, 300ZX etc) and went for less than $20K, $6k less than the
944.  However, when the value of the Deuschemark declined, the price
went up to around $30K and sales declined.  Most people in this price
range spent the extra $6K on the 944.  I heard a story that someone lost
their job for producing a car that was faster than the 944 and cost
less.

Basically, most would argue, not with the performance and technical
portions of the car, but that it lacks in looks.  The 1987 944 has the
fender flairs and ground effects and an updated interior "look".  I've
read that the 944 is a 924 on testosterone.  Some people are into that.
Also many people, who don't know, look at the 924 as not really a
Porsche as it was originally a new design by Porsche for a VW sports car
but when VW scraped the project, Porsche picked it up.  You might get
some flack about that.  The 924S is a totally different car and most
agree it is what the 924 should have been all along.  If your looking to
buy a Porsche for it's looks, buy the 944.  If your looking for a
Porsche for it's heritage, performance, handling, and aren't caught up
in the macho thing plus want to save a few bucks I'd say go with the
924S.  It's a great car.  Virtually bullet proof...if cared for.

Things to watch for on both the 924S and the 944 are the water pump,
timing belt, motor mounts and oil cooler seal.  These items have been
notorious and can cost you $$$$ if they are not maintained and go bad.
If they are maintained there are really no problems.  Make sure you have


good records from the previous owner and have it checked out by a
reputable mechanic familier with Porsches.  Check out the 924/944/968
faq. www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html.  Lots of good information
on both cars.

My car is a 1988 924S Special Edition.  It was marketed as a performance
not a luxury car.  All of the power convienences were removed (power
windows, locks, sunroof, antenna, rear wiper) as well as the leather
interior. A "sport" suspension (M030) was added along with wider alloys
on the rear.  It is 80 lbs lighter than a normal 924S and cost $900 more
and is faster.  Mine stickered for $27,800.  I am the third owner and it
has spent most of it's life in a garage.  It only has 19,700 original
miles 1000 of which I have put on it in the last month I have owned it.
I have enjoyed it tremendously.

I hope this has been helpful,  let me know what you decide.

     Anyone have any bad luck or experiences with Exxon Supreme gasoline?  
     I thought I read that Amoco Ultimate was ranked highest (purest, 
     best-igniting?) in Consumer Reports or some similar publication, and I 
     believe Exxon was ranked second.
     
     Also, anyone know about the performance of Lubro-Moly injector 
     cleaners and carbon-deposit removers?  My 951 is in for a major 
     service today and I mentioned Techron to my mechanic.  He suggested 
     the 2-step Lubro-moly instead.  There was also this pump system I 
     could have him use for more money, but he said that he only used that 
     machine on cars with injector problems and that the additives are just 
     fine for maintenance.  Any comments or suggestions?
     
     Thanks,
     Ben
