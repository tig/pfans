Folks,

Recently Barry Lenoble posted the procedure for
transaxle oil change.  Thanks Barry, and some comments -

          > 3. 17mm Allen hex key (available from Sears, Snap On, or
          > you could   borrow one)

The fill plug is close enough to
the muffler that using an allen key was not convenient.  A 17mm
hex socket is a good idea -- I had a friend of a friend cut
a couple of inches off my hex key and weld it into a 6 point
17mm socket - several extensions and a ratchet works like a charm.

          > Mobil 1 75W/90 gear oil

I've been very happy with this - smoother shifting than
whatever was in there to begin with.

The Sears combo is what I use - great deal and heavy (i.e.  
over-engineered
to protect your head ).

Good idea - remember this stuff is VISCOUS and will take a very
long time. Note, contrary to a later post, this IS very helpful
even for Mobil 1.

I put the car up on 4 stands adjusted to insure it's level.
