"Well doctor, I took a good look at that alternator, and wondered
if my life would be easier if I just removed it.  But then, I was
caught by...if I remove it and nothing is under there, then I've
wasted time...so I get stuck, and no decision is made."


The turbo trauma continues...


I took a look at my manifold.  There is oil coked on the inside
of the #1 cylinder tube.  I've been cursed.


Yesterday I seriously considered the propects of putting everything
back together and taking the car to someone who knows what they
are doing.  I spend my day turning bolts millimeter by millimeter.
I wonder if life would be easier if I removed the engine.  I
wonder if I'll make it to the club race at Road America.  I wonder
if I really need a 401k plan...


I begin to gain my wits.  I realize that every 17mm bolt I see
on the engine doesn't hold the turbo on.  In fact, the turbo
seems to be bolted to the engine support by 6mm allen head bolts.

I casually wonder what time it is.  I think about my girlfriend.
She wanted to go on a bike ride.  I told her we'd go at 4, it is
now 5.  I make a critical decision, either get in the Spectrum
and go get her and go for a ride, or go clean up; get her and go
get something to eat.

I'm still seething inside.  I decide I shouldn't go for a ride,
but I should go clean up and get her.  I feel better.


That night I dream about driving my car out to a field.  Pulling
out a 3 pound sledge hammer.  Fondling the slick hickory handle,
letting my eyes rest on the bright orange head.  I pop the hood,
lift the hammer, and smash away...

I wake up, I'm happy.

But I still have bolts to move, millimeter by millimeter...
