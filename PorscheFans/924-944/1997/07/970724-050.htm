Hi Robert,

Good for you.

Why do you think you have to replace the clutch? Is the rubber center
shot? Does it slip? If it doesn't slip, and you can shift easy, and
don't hear or feel anything in it, then don't change it.

If you're clutch does need replacement, then I suggest you do it yourself.
It is easier on the NA cars (Michael Kehr's was a turbo), and you sound
like it's something you can handle. The FAQ is an excellent guide.
 
> My garage told me 20 hrs. labor  $1500+, I trust them but I NEED THE CASH. 

That sort of makes up your mind doesn't it? You can get get a clutch kit for
your car for less than $500 (more like $375). IMHO, the clutch job is not
that complex, just time consuming. If you can do without the car for 2 weeks,
then you can do it yourself. You don't need ALL the tools the FAQ refers
too, so don't let that stop you. 

> Should I get the metal spring center spline clutch or replace it with

If it were my car, I would get the rubber center. It's cheaper, easier
on the rest of the driveline, and should last at least 10 years. While
I like Automotions catalog, and I do buy things from them, I would not
but clutch parts from them. Other places, like Vertex, Zims, Eurospeed,
Sonnen, (do I have to go on) will have the kit for MUCH less money.

> Also transmission oil, should I change it? It's kind of noisy when 
> I'm off the gas and coasting around 30mph in 3rd or 2nd.
> I've seen recos on trans/diff oils. What is the best?

If you don't know if it's been done, change it. I use Swepco 201 gear
oil. I've written a tech piece for my regions newsletter on changing
trans oil. Let me know if you want a copy. 

> Can any place such as local parts stores turn rotors for Porsches?

Yes. However, unless you need to, don't bother turning the rotor.

good luck,
