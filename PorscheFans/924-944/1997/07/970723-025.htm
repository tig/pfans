Hello PorsheFriends.

Just thought I would post a note here about Farzaan's video.  This video is
awesome!  And I don't even understand a word of Japanese.  `Yoweeee` means
the same thing in English as it does in Japanese, when you're driving a 993TT
hard and the tail is about to come out!  Want to see some Ferraris drag race
with Porsches?  Want to see a track race with Ferraris, Porsches, Acura NSX-R,
and even a Dodge Viper, all together?  Farzaan is into performance tuning, and
as such has included a good segment on Japanese tuners demonstrating 0-300 kmh
runs.  This video was excellent and IMHO is better than other videos costing
$40 or $50.  BTW, Farzaan did not charge extra for the video, only for cost of
tape and postage, so it's definitely money well spent.  If you appreciate all
exotic marques then this video is definitely a must see and I would very
strongly recommend it for you.  Plenty of Porsche action in this video.

I'm posting this because I think many list members would enjoy this video.  I'm
not getting any kickback $$$ from Farzaan for recommending his video.  In fact
Farzaan will probably have to give up more of his spare time to make copies if
more people express an interest.  And yes, I would be interested in seeing the
sequel to this video Farzaan!
