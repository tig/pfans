>Does the K&N filter as well as the OEM filter?

I would be concerned if more particulates were entering the intake at the=

expense of airflow resistance (lack of) and cleanability (longevity).

I do not want to trade engine life for filter convince.  How do they
compare?

Marv,

I have no data on Porsches but from my desert racing days I learned a few=

things about air filters.  The K &N should stop the same micron size dust=

particles as the stock filter because  of the oiling.  With the stock pap=
er
filter the dust will build up and cause restriction.  With the oiled filt=
er
the particles stick to the oil.  The particles have to navigate a maze of=

fibers which causes them to run into the oiled fibers and stick.  Even wh=
en
the filter looks to be clogged with dirt, there is still good airflow.  I=
f
the paper and oiled are both new there is probably little difference.  Wh=
en
the filters get dirty is when you should feel the difference.

My S2 partner said he felt a difference when he installed a K&N.  I
couldn't tell any difference with my turbo.

BTW, thanks for sending the airbag reset procedure.  It worked great, now=

that red light is finally out.  A small victory is still a victory, black=

tape begone.
