My '87 944S developed a "sputtering" during acceleration about a week
after I got it, mostly at the low RPM range (during acceleration at low
end of each gear). Also, after driving and coming to a stop, the engine
sometimes drops to a very low RPM and the engine almost dies. I can rev
the engine slightly ( and slowly) and the RPM seems to pick back up.  I
have changed the plugs, distributor cap, cleaned the injectors, but no
improvement.  I have been told that the Throttle Position Sensor is a
likely culprit.  I checked the switch while mounted on the throttle body
and measured the following readings: 
throttle closed - 0 ohms, terms.2-13/ infinite ohms, terms. 3-13;
throttle slightly opened - infinite ohms, terms. 2-13;
throttle 3/4% open - 0 ohms, terms. 3-13.
Does this sound correct? Does anyone have any ideas?

Please help, because this occurred so recent after I got the car, I have
not been able to appreciate the full performance of this vehicle.

Thanks
