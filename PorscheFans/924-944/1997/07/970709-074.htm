Thank god for European models, then.. :) They don't have the ugly
reflectors, nor the ugly big bumpers with those nasty big bumper pads the US
models have. I think the interior is quite nice (apart from the cheap
materials), considering its age. I can't think of a single car from '76 with
better interior. Most other car's interiors from the early eighties are
square and thin, and IMHO don't look very good. It also has a high center
console, which I particularly like. I don't like the "empty" 911 interior
with a shift lever of truck proportions. Long, stalky thing..

If you have never seen a Euro 924/944 before, take a look at mine at
http://home.sn.no/~tbk/mycar.htm

I also have a picture of a 959 at http://home.sn.no/~tbk/p959.htm :)
