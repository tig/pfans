Farz,
 Let me know how the test pipe goes on. There is no room for error down
there. Yor cat is probably welded on by now. Should be fun. Have you
tried the bleeder valve method yet? Automotion sells one for in the car
now. It is in the latest catalog. A little pricey however. I do use
racing gas every now and then, but it gets expensive. By the way I do
not drive with 17lbs. at all times. It takes a while to spool up and by
the time it reaches 17 I am usually going 100+ mph. which is not that
practical for driving in town.
