The problem with this, is that it assumes I have overflowed my gas
during fill up.  Assume for now that this has never happened (unless my
wife did it, a-ha!;)) I think this mystery leak exists somewhere within
the gas tank.  Does anyone notice that the gas pump nozzle doesn't fit
into the tank as snuggly as in an american car?
