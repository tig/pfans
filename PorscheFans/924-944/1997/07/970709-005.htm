Hi All!,

I am considering yet another car, so the time has come to sell (sadly) one
  of my projects....

1982 924 Turbo (931)
  Complete car (unless I get enough people that want assorted parts)
  Engine is disassembled, the crankshaft needs work.  The factory 
  service manual (has anybody priced these?  Geez!) does not have specs
  for thrust dimensions, so the project got put on hold.  It takes a 
  standard (and available) 924 crank, so it shouldn't be too tough.
  One of the con rods also has bearing material embedded in it, so you
  may have to locate another of those (standard 924, again).

I bought the car with a blown motor, and found the turbo was fried (seized,
  actually), so I bought a new turbo (which is sitting in my office, never
  installed).  (that's a K26)

The car has PW, PM, A/C (unlikely that it works, at this point) and 
  unknown mileage (the odo stopped at ~60K).  I've never had the car
  running, so I can't say anything about trans/tube, etc.

I do have the service manual, which will be available if I end up parting the
  car.  I want to sell it whole, but if you want something, let me know.
  If enough people are in need of parts, I'll do it that way.

For more info, please email me directly (as I'm on the digest).

Thanks for the bandwidth!
