Well, I knew it might happen.  I put new rear hatch struts on my 931 and now
the glass has begun to separate from the rear hatch frame.  I love these cars,
but IMHO the Porsche/Audi/VW engineers were hung over from Oktoberfest when
they designed the rear hatch on the 924.  They're 99% glass with just a hint
of metal and rubber around the edge.  Maybe the replacement struts had too much 
pressure in them.  The struts push backward on the whole assembly with about
200 lbs. of force when it is closed.  I don't think the alignment/latch pegs in
the back absorb any of this tension and the hinges are quite solid.  Therefore, 
the obvious weak link in the chain is the glued glass/frame connection.  After 
17 years you've got to expect the glue will fail.

OK, so she's not a spring chicken any more.  Now what?  I remember a quite
informative posting from another 924/944/968 rear hatch sufferer a few months
back.  Unfortunately I did not save the posting.  Can anyone with experience
fixing this problem please repost a narrative of the repair process, or send
it to me directly at the address below.  Thanks.
