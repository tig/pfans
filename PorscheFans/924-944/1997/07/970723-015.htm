Doug, I don't know the extent that you use your car for street/track
use, nor do I know the circumstances of your OTE.  If you have heavily
used your car for track, I would think that the arm had fatigued and
broke.  It is a very good idea to have all of your arms checked.  Forget
the magnaflux idea, that is only for ferrous material and your arms are
aluminum (I am assuming that you have the alum. front arms installed.)  
For my money and time, I would automatically modify and install steel
front arms and not even mess with the alum. ones.  For the rear, Zyglo
will only check for surface cracks, which I doubt you will find.  You
need to look inside the hollow arms to check for interior cracks...how
do you do that???  Look in your yellow pages for a real machine shop,
one that does aircraft style work.  The arms can be x-rayed or they can
use eddy currents or ultrasonics to check the outside and inside
surfaces of the arms (inside the hollow tubes).  The cost may be too
prohibitive, but you might find a shop that will take an interest in
helping you.  

I was a non-destructive inspection specialist in the Air Force and we
did this kind of stuff all the time.  It can be fascinating.  With the
cast rear arms, the inclusions (roughness) in the metal might show false
readings with a Zyglo treatment (dye penetrant and ultra-violet light),
so the other method would probably be better.

You are smart in checking these things out if you have had one failure
already.  Let me know what you find.
