> >First it had no airbag.  I thought this was standard?

  It is my understanding that any model cars sold for the U.S. market AFTER 
1988 had to have the airbags. I checked with TRANSCAR (one of 7? 
companies that are sanctioned by the U.S. to convert cars to U.S. 
spec) when I was thinking about bringing my 1991 951 to the U.S.. 
They would do the work to meet DOT and EPA (for a measly $6.7K) but I 
would have to get the airbag system put in myself since they don't do 
this work. A call down to the Local Friendly Porsche shop brought me 
an estimate of about $1.5K (using  1.61 DM to the $) to install it in my car.   
  Is this an aftermarket steering wheel?

fenders,and trunk.

  If you have a "Porsche Tech Spec Book"  it will tell you what your 
car is. Why don't you send the VIN # into the list and someone can 
tell you. Mine is at home.

  Yes it is possible, HOWEVER, check out what it have cost him. Plus, 
I don't see how he got it registered in the U.S. without the airbag. 
Oh yes, one other thing, shipping/insurance/handling/port fees were 
another $800. This is why I'll just save this money and get another 
Porsche if/when I come back to the U.S..

  Perhaps go to a better dealer who can tell you what the car REALLY 
is.

  That is true for the older model 944's. (My 83 944 has 163 bhp, 
while the U.S. version has 143 hp, my 91 951 has the same hp as 
the U.S. version 89 951.)  I can't remember the year, but Porsche 944 engines
since 19xx all have the same HP, whether U.S. spec or ROW. Again, check 
out the "Porsche Tech Spec Book" to see this. (Jesh, I hope my memory 
is still working.) George B. or Barry L., have your Tech book 
around??!!
