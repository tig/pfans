Hello Friends:

For about a year my '88 924S has sometimes only "clicked" when I turn the
key, and will not turn over.  This has not been a big problem, as it usually
only happened once every few weeks, and then would always start the second
time.  However in the last two days it has happened probably 10 times, and
has taken the third or even fourth try to engage the starter.

Does anyone have any idea what this could be?  I am no mechanic, but I know
my way around the car and do some minor things, so if the diagnostics or fix
does not live too far under other things I would be willing to do it myself.

Please E-mail direct, as I am on the digest version.  Thanks.
