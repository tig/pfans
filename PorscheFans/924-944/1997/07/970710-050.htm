I replaced the windshield on my '83 944 two months ago, with a LOT of 
help from a co-worker who has done >100 windshield installations on 
various cars.  I had use of a special heated, vibrating tool 
specifically designed to cut through old windshield adhesive and 
removing windshields.

My glass cost $170.  Installation would have been an additional $80, 
and the installers insisted I would need new aluminum trim.
If I have to do it over again I will let the installer do it, but 
with one caveat.

My installer insisted I would need new aluminum trim for the 
installation.  If you are careful loosening the old clips and 
removing the trim you can re-use it.
(tap the clips to the side to relieve pressure -- look at them 
closely and this will make sense)

So next time I might remove the trim myself and then take it in to
be replaced.  This would bring the installed cost down $40, since 
there's no trim to buy.

The biggest advantage to having it done in my opinion is the threat 
of breaking the new glass.  If the installer breaks it it's their 
loss, not yours.

I have seen real hack jobs installers have done on other cars over 
the years.  This was another big motivation for me to do it myself
(with the free help from a pro).

Getting the old butyl adhesive off after removing the glass is a 
miserable job, and comprised about 1 1/2 hours of the three hours it 
took me to do this job.

All above prices are US$, approximate to the nearest $5.
I got the glass at Henderson Auto Glass, here in the Detroit, MI 
area.

Good luck to all you crack-ups!
