Doug,
     I looked it up, the Porsche spec is 0.1mm installed, 0.05mm off the 
vehicle. I don't have a dial indicator to take the measurements, but would 
guess mine are all out of spec. I will turn down all of them. Anyone know why 
my front rotors would be warped after only ~4,000 miles? (one autocross) When 
I replaced the front rotors, the original alloy bolts were a bit worn, so I 
replaced them with steel bolts. Could this be part of my problem? (ie. 
different thermal coefficients of expansion)

Thanks,
       Ezra
