I'm going to remove my turbo pretty soon.  Are there any hints or tips anyone
>has that will help me out?

Dig out your camera and take pictures of the different layers of hoses,
vacuum lines and fittings as you dig to turbo land.  Buy one or two
throw-a-way 15mm box end wrenches that you can grind and heat and bend.
When you get to those two turbo nuts, you will know what I am talking about.  

Make sure you have it rebuilt by someone with a good reputation.  You do
not want to have to pull it again.

     I having a problem with the dash/interior switch lighting on my 93 
     968.  On 
     the instrument panel the light for the tach is intermittent and when 
     it 
     works it still appears the light for the volt meter is out.  In 
     addition to 
     the intermittent problem, certain switches (electric window switches 
     on 
     both doors, sunroof switch and mirror selector switch) do not light up 
     with 
     the dash lights.
     
     My questions are:       Has/Does anyone had similar problems and can 
     point to a 
     common point of this malady?  Should the above listed switches have 
     lighting to them when the dash lights are on?  Any other 
     suggestions/hints/etc. would be appreciated and helpful.
     
     
     
        If the 968 dash and cokpit layout is anything like my 951's and 
     every other late 944, then I don't think the sunroof, mirror 
     adjustment, and window buttons are backlit like the door lock one is.  
     So as far as I know, this is normal.  BUT, if your potentiometer 
     (voltmeter) light does not come on before starting your car BEWARE!  
     I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say the "light for the 
     voltmeter is out," but if you don't ever see it anymore, it means 
     you're driving your car and running all of your accessories off of 
     your battery.  This bulb only fails to light if its blown or if 
     there's a loose wire connection in your factory alarm loop.  The bulb 
     does fail by itself (like every bulb) in rare instances, and a fried 
     alternator could also cause the bulb to blow too.
        I hope your electrical woes are solved soon!
