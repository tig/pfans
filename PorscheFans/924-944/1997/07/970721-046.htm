Perspective of a backround list member, fairly long, and MY OPINION:

When the repeating email started, I just sort of *assumed* it was a
server or mailhost problem.  As I could not offer help, I rigged a
couple of filters, and had it auto-deleted as it came down.  Again, I
*assumed* it would be resolved by Monday.

Anyhow, watching the traffic fly back and forth, I think alot of people
had good reason to be aggravated, but that is no excuse to be
uncivilized.  In fact, putting more traffic out on the wire only
exacerbates the problem, and flaming at random pours gasoline on the
fire.

While I saw a few of the more juvenile replies, the more hateful ones
that were reported really amaze me.  Why would *anyone* think this is
productive??  A really good way to shit-can the list is to harrass a
server administrator (unpaid, at that) into throwing up his hands and
saying "screw you folks, you don't like it, you do it".  

Computers occassionally miss-behave;  They always have and they always
will.  When a disruption occurs, try to help, or take a valium and
wait.  If you can't stand imperfection, sell your hardware and buy
books.  If you just have to resort to personal attacks, frankly the list
is better off without you.  Remember, the server administator can filter
*you* from the list, should you become obnoxious enough.

In closing, may I humbly suggest that those of you who chose to rant and
personally attack via email take lessons in civility, manners and
etiquette.  If someone had suggested crude remarks re: my wife, I would
have A) busted your nose if you were standing in front of me, or B)
tried to track you down via header information in your email message.

Now, back to Porsches.....
