Hi everyone (long),

First, I wanted to comment about the Gates belt tensioning tool. We use
similar Gates belts in production on a project I have at work. Gates does
make a 'belt tensioning tool'. It doesn't actually tension the belt, what
it does is to measure the frequency that the belt vibrates at when you
'twag it and from that calculates the belt tension. The tool is over $1,000
and it's really an electronic instrument like what's used to tune a piano.
It would probably work on the 944's but you would have the same old
problem, you'd have to calibrate it.

Well, I've had my 'new' '89 951 for about a month now (previously owned an
'86 951 for 7 years with a '94 RX7 in between) and wanted to share some of
my impressions and let those of you who were kind enough to point me in the
right direction on a few things know how it all came out.

I had my dash recovered (the car must have spent it's first 5 or 6 years
out in the sun, most of the interior was trashed but the paint is still
primo!). The car has the Navy Blue interior and I couldn't find any sources
of a used Navy Blue dash. I had Dean at the Dash specialists in Oregon
re-cover it -- I highly recommend them. They do many of the dash
restorations for concours cars. I sent the dash to him on Wednesday, he got
it on Friday worked over the weekend and I had it back to  me on Tuesday!
Now that's service!  It's now covered in marine grade vinyl (looks just
like the original, except looks really new) which won't chip, flake, peel,
de-laminate, warp, etc. for my lifetime. I tend to be a bit retentive (!!
my wife says) about things and I like to have everything as near perfect as
is possible so, I was concerned about how good a job could be done and how
close to factory it would be. Well, I can report that it looks beautiful
and it's better than the factory dash ever was, Dean re-covered both the
navy blue top portion as well as the cream colored bottom portion. Email me
directly if you want more details, I'm really happy with it!

Chips, etc.
Comparing the power/torque with my '86 951, I don't subjectively 'feel' any
real difference between the '86 & the '89. If there is, it is only at the
high end >5000 RPM. The suspension is tighter on the '89 and it leans less,
the limited slip behaves differently (I was getting used to the
Gleason-Torsen on the '94 RX7) than the non-limited slip.  The one overall
thing that really stands out are the brakes. They have really improved from
the '86, the stopping power and the feel are both improved. The car is
every bit as nice as I had remembered/hoped it would be.

After driving it for about 2 weeks, I installed the AutoThority 2.7 chip
set/banjo bolt (thanks Jason). I set the max. boost to 2.0 bar with a good
gauge and while doing so, didn't really pay attention to the performance
change, I was more interested in not overboosting it. I say this because
after installing the chip set, I didn't have the opportunity to open it up
for 2 days so my first impressions were just driving around town. I was a
bit apprehensive because of some of the things I've read and also some of
the comments from the list (lag, detonation, etc.). I thought I might
sacrifice low end drivability, but not to worry, the low end (1500-3000) is
actually improved. I can remember thinking initially 'wow, it's much
smoother' I don't think that there's any noticeable increase in torque, I'd
guess if at all, it's less than 10% but the drivabililty is definitely
better (good job AutoThority). When I did have the opportunity to open it
up, my first impression was WOW, this thing really screams (I still think
WOW when I open it up). Subjectively, I'd estimate that there's around a
30% increase in power in the upper band (4800 - 6200). I'm really
impressed, this is quite a return for the $$$. If anyone has more ???,
email me directly.

I was really interested to see the drag race results from Farzaan. The
brochure for my 951 lists the curb weight as 2998 lbs. W/247 SAE net HP @
6000 RPM. 0-60 is quoted as 5.7 sec. The brochure for my '94 RX7 (now sold,
couldn't stand to be without my German steel!) lists curb weight as 2826
lbs. W/255 SAE net HP @ 6500 RPM. 0-60 is quoted as 4.7 sec, with the best
published quarter mile time I've seen listed as 13.7 sec. My guess is that
with the AutoThority chip set/banjo bolt combination, the two cars will be
almost identical in straight line performance after about 40 MPH. My
impression of the RX7 is that it has massive low end acceleration (along
with 11 MPG if you use it) and the acceleration falls off in the upper end,
it should be pretty easy to achieve sub 5 sec. 0-60 runs. The 951 on the
other hand seems opposite, low end leaves something to be desired, while
the upper end really pulls hard. I wonder if the times for some of the
other cars that Farzaan published were their best runs or an average? As
you can see from the list, just adding horsepower doesn't mean that you'll
get there quicker! I seem to remember the 427 Cobra being quoted as doing
0-100-0 in under 10 seconds. Does anyone have any published data to
correlate this (or first hand experience)? Anyway, shows that the 951 is
still a world class performer!

Different subject. Valentine radar detector. I'd like to permanently mount
one in my car & I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with hard
mounting a radar detector. It looks to me as though I'd like it to be just
above the rear view mirror but if I do that, It looks like I couldn't close
the sun visors. Anyone know for sure? I'm also wondering about attaching a
bracket to the car. Is there anywhere to screw into? Any suggestions on
this? I seem to remember a recent post on the list saying that grabbing
power from the interior light is a good place to get it. Is this correct?
Any help here would be appreciated.

Last subject. The speakers seem shot (mainly the rears). The car has the
factory Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette W/equalizer. What are my options for drop
in replacement speakers and stereo? I'm not really interested in modifying
anything to install the stereo & I'm not after a really killer system. I
had a $2500 Alpine system in my '86 951 but just found that I spent more
time driving the car than listening to the stereo, so it wasn't a good
investment. I'd just like something nice that isn't too expensive. I think
that the original factory equipment might do the job if the speakers
weren't shot (I think it's the speakers, not the amp putting out massive
distortion). Suggestions, comments???

Thanks for listening, I love the list, it's great!
