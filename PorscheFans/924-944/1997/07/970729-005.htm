Recently I have heard and read several complaints on this list regarding
the Nology spark plug wires.  I purchased my set approximately 7 months
ago from Engine Rebuilders and have had no problems whatsoever.  In
fact, my car had quicker acceleration when I put the Nology wires on my
car.  When I put the old wires back on as a test, I definitely could
tell a difference.  The car didn't do wheelies or go 200 mph, but you
could feel the difference.   Could be it was just the fact the plug
wires were new, however, my old wires weren't in too bad of shape.
Maybe Nology got lax in their quality control recently or maybe I got
lucky, I don't know.  Just thought I'd put my two cents in on this
subject.
