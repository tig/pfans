I am just wondering if someone can help me.  Are racing seats like the
Momo
rookie or a Sparco seat too much to live with day to day...........

Hi Zak,

I have a 968CS as my daily driver and it has Recaro Fixed Bucket Seats
as standard. These are very similar to the Momo or Sparco seat with a
high side, and on first appearance look uncomfortable.

Firstly the Racing seat does require a commitment to get in the car,
with no height adjustable steering wheel , you kinda leap into the seat
with your legs wedged under the wheel , and hopefully not destroy the
driver door trim with your shoes.

On a positive side the seats are superb, fantastic lateral support,
really comfortable inspite of the zero adjustment ; and certainly draw
commments from any passenger. I drive about 200-400km a week, and have
never had any complaints with the seats. However passengers have found
it difficult , especially my female work collegues in business attire!
Any large person will not fit either ( unless its a generous sized race
seat). 

My car has had the rear seat removed ( as standard ) with just carpet on
the passenger seat wells looks good and still okay for briefcases etc.

Hope this helps you out.

Regards
