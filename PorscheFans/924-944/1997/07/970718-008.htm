John,
     These are common problems. I have all of them as well ('86 NA 944). The 
heat being stuck on is probably a result of the servo "bearing" being broken. 
The "bearing" as it is called by PCNA is really a small plastic clip that 
connects the heater flap control rod to the servo mechanism. It is located in 
the upper right hand side of the driver's side footwell, The Part Number 
(provided by George Beuselinck):
"The part number in question is 944.572.313.00 (the dealer can find it on
the 85/2-88 944 microfiche in frame 8/13/00, it is reference #13, listed
as "bearing"."  I have not gotten around to ordering a replacement yet, I am 
using nylon ties for now.

  The A/C switch climate control switch be repaired, replacements are 
expensive. Details on this repair can be found in  Steve Gomberg's posting on 
June 29th, and in  Naweed Azam's posting on June 30th. I have yet to order the 
replacement part. For the moment, I am using a washer to jamm the switch in.

  I have D40M2's (225/50/15, too wide) on the front. They have developed some 
uneven wear which causes shimmy. Unfortunately, I put the tires on the vehicle 
prior to repairing numerous front end components. I suspect that D40M2's are 
susceptible to any suspension play in that they develop uneven wear. I tried a 
poor man's tire shave last weekend. I swapped the front and rear wheels, and 
went around on some back roads (paved), and burned some rubber. The offset on 
the rear wheels when installed in the front makes them stick out a bit, and 
changes steering characteristics, but they did not rub the fender. After 
placing the wheels back where they belong, I am experiencing about half of the 
tire shimmy from prior to the shave. I don't have the funds to buy all new 
rubber, but eventually will place the front Rubber on the rear rims, and buy 
new rubber for the front (~215/55/15, anyone have used ones for sale?).

Windshield squirters, mine don't work at all due to a busted pump, but I 
understand there are check valves of some sort? that can become stuck. I 
believe these are in line with the squirters. Only my right hand side 
headlight squirter works at this time. Just add it to the list of things to 
fix....
 
Good Luck,
          Ezra
