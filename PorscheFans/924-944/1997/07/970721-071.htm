I recently purchased a 944S2 with 85k miles.  The fuel pump makes quite a
bit of noise when I first start up (loud hum).  It seems to quiet down over
time, but perhaps this is because I get used to the sound.  I have owned an
84 944 since new, and have never heard the fuel pump at all.  Can anyone
tell me if such noise is characteristic of S2s?  Thanks.

     What?  Didn't you know that this was the 951 list?  Everyone in the 
     world who owns a 951 is on this list!  Unless you at least have a son 
     who parks his 951 in your garage (I think I'm referring to Tom 
     Pultz?), then you're going to continue to feel out of place on this 
     list.  But sometimes we like to hear how our 968 friends are doing 
     too.   ;)
     
     No offense intended to Ian, Tom Pultz, or anyone else on this list 
     (please, I was just joking around).  Of course we all welcome posts 
     about any and all Porsches.  I just find it interesting and somewhat 
     humorous that this list does not reflect the true distribution of 
     water-cooled (924/944/968) Porsches.  Why do 951's have a stronger 
     presence on this list?  One would think we'd see a lot more 944 and 
     924 posts.  Maybe our 951's are just the cars having all the problems?

     So I hope to be posting more stuff in the future about my fledgling 
     days as a 968 owner.  I agree with the past comments about the lack of 
     968 postings and hope to be able to contribute something in that area.

     You can buy the special epoxy yourself at PepBoys or a similar Auto 
     Parts store.  $5 is a lot less than $50.  And the stuff works.  
     Haven't used it on my own Porsche, but it's held up for years on other 
     cars.
     
     Yeah, the list server is "playing up" again, to say the least!

     Apologies if this is a repeat message.  The List Server seems to be 
     playing up again, and I'm not getting confirmations of postings or 
     digests (despite re-subscribing).
     
     Question:  How do I re-attach my rear view mirror to the windscreen. 
     I've tried a double-sided sticky pad, but now the mirror vibrates like 
     crazy.  The main dealer wants to charge me $50(and 24 hours) for 
     re-attaching with special epoxy!
     
     TIA
