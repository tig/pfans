Subject:  944S2 cabriolet 

I have recently noticed what sounds like a relay clicking upon turning 

the key to the #2 position before starting the engine.  It has only 

happened a few times and lasts about 10 seconds.  it appears to be 

coming from either under the right side of the dash or the engine 

compartment behind the firewall.  It doesn't happen every time I start 

the car!  Could this be an alternator going bad; I notice that the 

charging voltage is not quite as high as it had been for the past year 

(it was near 13 volts now it is just over 12 volts and very steady.

Has anyone else had this "problem"?  I would hate to get stuck in the 

middle of nowhere with a dead battery.  Any thoughts would be 

appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Mike Diamond
