Special Event!      Water Cooled Car Technical Session (944 - 968 - 928)

Who:  White-Allen Porsche

Where:  Dayton, Ohio

When:  Saturday, September 27 @ 11:00 AM

Refreshments and the Grill will be in Service.

This Months Topic:  Cam Belt Replacement and Porsche Tensioning Tool Use.

Want to know how to replace your own cam belts?  Want to know how to use 
the elusive Porsche Tensioning tool?  Want to learn how to calibrate that 
tool?  Just got technical questions?  Hungry?

This will be the place.  Get blow by blow details on how to expertly 
replace those cam belts and correct procedures for "the tool" use.

We will have all three types of front engine cars presented as procedural 
models.  The tricks of the trade will be discussed on proper maintenance 
and replacement of the cam belt.

Of course, if you have other questions, or would simply like to browse 
the lot, come join us for the event.  Meet other members an enjoy the 
food.

If you are anywhere near Dayton, please stop by!


I don't want you air cooled guys to feel left out.  I hope to see you in 
force as well.  Next month we would like to host a technical session 
dedicated to the rear engine cars.  This would be an excellent time to 
make a request for what you would most like to have presented at your 
next tech. session.

Suggestions for the 911 session will be appreciated.  Tell me what you 
want to see!


We would like to see as many Porsche Fans as possible, and would greatly 
appreciate an RSVP so we can make sure that we have enough of everything. 
 Also, let me know what model car you have or want to know about.  Spread 
the word!

Any other questions?  Drop me an E-mail, or just call...
