No, not on racing units. With Koni, non-racing units are guaranteed for life
to the original purchaser. Doesn't cover original equipment units supplied
by Porsche unless of course they are covered under warranty (from Porsche).

How stiff is stiff is a tough question, one I deal with almost everyday.
I've got the double adustable front Konis and Turbo Cup springs on the front
of my '89 and haven't found it too bad. Is it a cadillac ride, no, has my
girlfriend complained, no, if it was just a street cruiser would I want to
install them, no. I leave them on full soft on the street and adjust for
track usage. Same thing for swaybars.
