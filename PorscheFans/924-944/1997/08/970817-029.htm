Subject: Brake Pads, Rotors and Tires


Hello All,

Sorry for the length of this but sometimes it's hard to be concise.

First, the Brake Stuff:

Specific application is a 1988 951 but I would appreciate info from anyone.
Looked in the FAQ but didn't find much.

Looking for new Brake pads for street use.

Constraints:
1) Brakes Very Well when Cold
2) Low dusting
3) Not too much fade
4) Pad wear not important
5) Rotor wear not important

Is this combination available?

I have heard both good and bad about Carbon Fiber.
How are they cold?
Do they dust?

Pads I have used:
Porsche Pads:		Ok when cold, lots of dust, Ok fade.
Repco Metal Masters:	Terrible when cold, Virtually no dust, Very good Fade.
Rofren:			Very good Cold, Lots of dust, OK fade,


The Italian-made Rofren pads are what I use now on my fronts - still using a
set of Repcos on rear and want to change them very soon. If I could find
something like the Rofren with less dust, I would be very happy.

I am using Cross-Drilled and slotted rotors. I originally bought them because
they look cool - but it seems and feels like they actually bite the pads
better than a plain, vented rotor. I was quite surprised by this. Since I
only use the car for street driving, I didn't think that I would get much
benefit from Cross-drilling. Also, they make a cool sound when stopping from
high velocities! Worth every penny. 

Actually I found a guy who would sell me a new pair of German rotors with
cross-drilling and gas slotting for only 117.00ea. They seemed to put a
reasonable number of holes in the disc and they were properly radiused. Not a
whole bunch of holes like some companies do - which must be detrimental since
the rotor would be losing so much mass. He said that he has the rotors
drilled at a shop that drills rotors for NASCAR vehicles. Not sure if that's
true but it sounded good so I bought the rotors from him. If anyone is
interested, I can tell you the name and phone number of the place.

Anyway, I also told him that I was looking for a street pad that works well
cold. I had been using Repco Metal Masters on all four wheels but I think
they are just too slow to heat up for normal, street driving. You really pay
a penalty with those things when using them cold. When they're hot, they seem
to get a lot better but I said I'd be willing to take a little less fade
resistance for better cold stopping. Well, he suggested the Rofren brand. He
said the have the same 70% (or was that 60%) metallic content of the Repco
Metal Maters (which he said means they have similar fade characteristics) but
that they had a 'softer' metal and a coarser particle size which worked
better when cold. Does this make sense to anyone? Anyone tried Rofren pads?
Price was about $57.00. Reasonably cheap.


On another topic, tires.

Thanks for all the advice on tires last week. I decided to buy the Yokohama
AVS S4 all seasons. Will tell you how much worse they are than my current
Dunlop SP Sport 8000 summer tire.
