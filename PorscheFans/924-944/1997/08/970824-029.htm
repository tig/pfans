In my continuing quest to replace every part on my 944 Turbo, whether it =
is
needed or not, I submit the following:

My mysterious engine cutout continued.  Everything had been checked or
replaced except the DME.  It was either buy another brain or call Ghost
busters.  I opted for the DME and my call to George B. went something lik=
e
this.

Me:  "Hello George, it's Capt. Squid, I need a new brain."

GB:  "Seems to be a common request from you California boys, sorry can't
help."

Me:  "George, last time we talked, you said you had a spare brain in
stock."

GB:  "Spare brain?  This is New York!  Don't you know how hard it is to
find anyone around here with a brain much less a spare one?"

Me:  "I need a turbo brain."

GB:  "Turbo brain, hmmm, doubt if there is one available on the entire
eastern seaboard.  Definitely not in the DC area."

Me:  "George, this is important, you must know where I can find a brain."=


GB:  "Ok, for you, call Cousin Vinny in Jersey, he has a good supply of
body parts."

Me:  "I don't think I am making myself clear."

GB:  "You talk about clear?  The last time you called, you were looking f=
or
a see through bra and the time before that a big haired woman.  Let me ma=
ke
myself clear.  I don't lift and separate, I don't run an escort service a=
nd
the only body parts I have are my own!"

Me:  "George, I need a brain for my Porsche."

GB:  "Why didn't you say so?  I have one on the shelf, give me your addre=
ss
and I'll ship it today."

George, being the prince of Porsche parts, notices the brain on the shelf=

has some stains on the cover so he sends me the brain out of his new race=

car instead.  Whata guy!
