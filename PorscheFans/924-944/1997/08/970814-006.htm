Marshall, welcome to the finest bunch of crazy sports car owners in the
world! You asked a couple of excellent questions, so let me try to outline
my key thoughts on them.

The '87 944 Turbo, depending on mileage and condition, can represent an
excellent value right now. These cars ('86 through "non-S" '88 Turbos) have
a smaller turbocharger and less HP (217 vs. 247) than the '88 "Turbo S" and
'89 models, and are in somewhat less demand. However, they have more HP and
slightly tighter suspensions than the 944S model (which, just to confuse
the name issue, is NOT turbocharged). If your prospective '87 Turbo has
relatively low mileage (less than 7,000 miles per year of age), it could be
a good deal. 

The 944S has a 187 HP 4-valve engine. Its power curve is "peakier" (i.e.,
much of the fun happens only at high RPMs), whereas the Turbo power curve
comes on stronger at lower RPM, albeit after a slight lag while all turbo
spins up to speed. Having owned both, I prefer the normally aspirated car
in local traffic, and the Turbo for open road fun. You'll have to decide
which you'll be doing more of.

Maintenance...... Bruce Anderson (PCA National technical guru) once told me
that he believes that all turbos need to be rebuilt every 25-30k miles, and
that they need to be used regularly in between to keep the seals from
drying out and failing (look for oily blue smoke on start-up, and
excessively black exhaust deposits). Rebuilt turbos run about $1,100 for
the part, with your run-out unit in exchange. Cubic horsepower costs cubic
money.........

That hasn't been my experience. We've got about 50k on a non-factory
Callaway 944 ('82) and the Turbo isn't objectionably bad despite annual
driving of under 2,000 miles for the past decade. (It's my wife's. Garage
furniture, anyone?....) So, Bruce's feelings may not be universally
applicable.

Otherwise, the '87 and later cars are pretty bulletproof. Most have the
later designs of water pump and motor mount, which are the two Achilles
heels of the earlier cars.

Performance wise, the 944S is best at higher RPM, but loses the ultimate
acceleration and top speed prizes to the Turbo. On the handling front, the
Turbo has slightly larger tires, I think, but that can be fixed after you
buy. Otherwise, the feel of the two, power input aside, is very similar.

Good luck with your new toy, and stay tuned to Porschefans for good
comments on common problems.

Sincerely,

.
