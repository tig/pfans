Thanks Rick,

The first call was to the dealer, the second was my insurance carrier.  
To keep my rates as low as possible I selected a $500 deductible for 
comprehensive and collision damages.  

As an interesting side note, my carrier had additional restrictions that 
gave me a shock.  I had fully intended to have White-Allen replace the 
glass, but my agent stated that they would guarantee to pay the full 
amount, minus the $500 deductible.  I asked for clarification on this 
point and the agent stated that they had select businesses that were 
signed up to their plan that they recommend to have replace the glass.  
They get (the insurance company) a discount from these shops and if I 
choose an outfit that was not on their list they would only agree to pay 
the amount that their service organization would charge.

This alarmed me, but I found that White-Allen subcontracts their glass 
works and the subcontractor was on the approved list of the insurance 
company.  This gave me some relief, but I was shocked by the difference 
in costs between the dealer glass and the replacement that the 
subcontractor offered.  The subcontractor claimed the glass was OEM, but 
did not have the Porsche logo as they are not an authorized Porsche 
dealer.  Sounds suspicious to me, but I would consider this if they would 
put in writing that this glass is OEM and not an after market replacement.

The price the subcontractor quoted was $650 for the complete job!  This 
is quite a difference between the dealer price of $2250 for the glass 
only!

If I were to select dealer glass, the insurance company would be glad to 
cut me a check for $150 (that's $650 - $500 deductible) for my damages.

As you can see, this is far from settled yet, and I will not get to 
having the glass installed until later this week as I have the car torn 
down to replace the oil pan gasket.  I may need an attorney before this 
is finished.

I will keep the list informed.
