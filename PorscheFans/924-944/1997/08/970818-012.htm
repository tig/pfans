Marshall,

Do NOT buy an Automatic!!!! When you have 150HP the stick helps. Try to sell
an automatic. Try maintaining a certain RPM going thru an off camber,
decreasing radius turn with an automatic. You maight be saying what the hell
is a decreasing radius....ect. When you buy your first Porsche you will
learn all about it. Join the PCA, best $35.00 you'll ever spend. Where do
you live? Go to the next autocross or drivers ed event and talk to the
people there, (pretty much the same type of person on this list). Now to all
the people with tips, don't flame me you are in a different situation. To
all you people who do have automatics, sorry.
