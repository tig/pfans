I must have done something to make my 944 angry with me.  When returning 
to the car after it has sat for about 10 minutes or longer, the heat 
comes on full blast, then the air coming out of the vents gradually cools 
over a few minutes time.  Needless to say, on these hot summer days, it 
is not pleasant to get into a hot car, then have the vents blast hot 
air.  Of course, this fights with the A/C, so the air doesn't cool right 
away until the heater core has cooled off.

I installed a helper into the driver's seat and observed the vacuum
operated heater valve above the bell housing as he started the engine. 
When he turned the key to illuminate the dash lights, the valve opened. 
After the engine starts, the valve closes within a second.  Of course this
heats the heater core to full temperature, which takes a few minutes to
cool to ambient temperature. 

Has anyone else had this problem?  I am suspecting a vacuum leak, a
misbehaving vacuum solenoid under the glovebox, or the temperature control
unit in the dash.  Any help pinpointing this would be appreciated. 

Thanks!

 -Gregor  944 2.7.  Hot.
