When I bought my 944 it had no undertray.

My mechanic had a spare one and so he fitted it for me.  I must admit 
I did not notice any difference.

However one dark night doing about 100mph on an empty trunk road a 
huge grey shape loomed out of the gloom directly in front of me in 
the middle of the road.   By the time I saw it I had run over it.  A 
huge bang accompanied the incident and a few miles later I manged 
to pull off and check the car.

My first thought was an animal but there was no blood etc so I 
reassured my worried girlfriend and breathed a sigh of relief that my 
karma was safe for another day.  Whatever it was it was very solid.  
It cracked the front spoiler and (the point of my story) made a hell 
of a dent and a long scrape in the undertray.  I can only assume that 
whatever it was had fallen from the back of a truck or something and 
the kind driver had either not noticed or thought 'what the hell!'

So one other point to remember about these lumps of sheet metal under 
our prides and joys would be that it could protect the soft 
underbelly and all those expensive bits and bobs from lumps of stray 
matter carelessly strewn about the highway.  I know I would rather 
replace a =A310 peice of  bolt on metal than a sump or worse!

Just a thought.
