Yes, it would help to have stacked horn antennas.  To disguise the true
nature of this radar killer machine, I would propose that you play "Pop
Goes The Weasal" on a bandwith limited external audio system and carry a
large supply of ice cream.

As a suggestion, the upper air intake on the GT-1 cars is 
about the correct shape for a microwave horn.  Since you 
don't really need all that airflow on the street, we can 
take our GT-1s, put a really great radar jammer in there 
and run them really fast on the interstate!

I need Farzann's opinion on this.  I'm not certain if 
the CD will be affected adversely by this, probably 
have to have him do some testing on my car, before and after,
put a new chip in to compensate.
