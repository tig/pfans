Miles,

Saw your post and wondered if you could e-mail me the Product info workbook
you cited.  I'd also like to know if the 500 or so 924S M030s you mention
are the total number produced, or the total number shipped to the US.
Also, these cars aren't faster than the regular 1988 2.5 liter cars per se,
just better handling.  The 158 hp and gearing is identical, so it should be
no "faster" than cars of near equal weight.

BTW,  there are going to be at least four of these cars contesting the
C-Stock class national championship at the SCCA Solo-2 Nationals in Topeka
Kansas on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 9th and 10th.  The car/driver
combination they'll try to beat is the 2.2 liter 1991 Toyota MR2 of Kevin
Bailey.  He's only been beaten by a 924S once this year, and that was only
after his front sway bar broke.  Other front engined water pumpers of note
will be the 944S2 cars of Jeff Reitmeir and Bill Buetow Looking for
national titles in A-Stock, along side the 968s of Matt Murray and Terry
Baker.  They'll be battling some good drivers in BMW M3s on Thursday and
Friday.  Should be a good show at Nationals this year.  About 950 entrants
for the 25th anniversary SCCA Solo 2 Nationals and counting.

RE:
Adrien,

This option was available on the 1988 924S Special Edition.  It is the
Sport Option which has stiffer shocks, and 25mm (I believe...) front and
rear sway bars.  I have a '88 **4 series Product Information Workbook (a
book given to the sales force to familierize them with the product) that
gives an exact description.  When I get home I'll e-mail it to you.

This car was marketed as a performance not a luxury car. ... It is 80 lbs
lighter than a normal 924S, and is
faster.  Mine stickered for $27,200. Only 500 were to be built, however
I know of a person who's VIN # indicates their car is #531.
