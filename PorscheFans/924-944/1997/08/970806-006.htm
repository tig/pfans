I'll join the list of folks that are aggravated by turbine-sounding timing
belts, not only on Porsches, but also on a Mazda pick-up and an old german-
made Mercury Capri.  The Capri is now deceased I'm sorry to say.

My 931 had perfectly quiet belts when I bought it used at 31K miles.  At 50K,
I replaced the timing belt and water pump.  Whirrrrrrrr......   Loosened the
belt a bit, whirrrrrr.......  Checked the roller, whirrrrr.....  So I lived
with it for 50K more miles.  New belt at 100K, almost no sound.  The first
replacement belt was a Gates brand, the second was Goodyear.

Same situation on my Mazda.  I've done the 60K, 120K and now 180K belt service
on it and noticed that each belt had a different level of noise.  It seems
that over-tightening will make any belt sound out, but some belts are noisy
at any tension.  I suspect the ribs are not exactly the same size as the valleys
in the timing wheels or that the spacing is not exactly to spec on some of them.

Just my experiences.
