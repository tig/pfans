Has any one on the list installed a Sanden rotary compressor
kit on a 944?  I purchased one from Griffiths Tech in NJ
for about $200 less than the kit listed in Automotion.  It
fit like a glove. When we tried to charge the system, the 
high side pressure was essentially equal to the low side.
Pfans list consensus was to get a new expasion valve.
$180 or so at Automotion, about $40 at my local AutoZone.
Also fit like a glove. With advise from list members it was
easily found and modestly easy to install.  Cools like mad but 
there are still a few peculiarities.  First there is still little pressure
difference between high and low side at idle.  The pressure
differential comes up rapidly and to a recommended level
as the RPM's rise. Secondly, the instructions warns against
over tensioning the belt and even though I have it tighter than I 
am comfortable with it still screams with so much slippage that 
the alternator is not charging adequately.  Is it possible that the 
belt supplied is of such poor quality that it wont bite? It certainly
looked like an el-cheapo.
Any advice or similar experiences?
Thanks;
Morgan
