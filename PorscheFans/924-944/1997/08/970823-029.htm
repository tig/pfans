Sorry about any confusion.  A fellow list member has let me know 
(thanks!) that this is the "Porsche Design" model wheel and that they are 
somewhat rare, and even better, somewhat expensive.  Since I didn't see 
it in any catalogs, I assumed it was just an obsolete model.

Until I figure out what it's worth, I'm going to hang onto it.  Can anybody 
offer an opinion on a reasonable asking price.  As I've just dropped a 
couple of grand on airbags, tires and stereo, I'd love to get something 
back.
