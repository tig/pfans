     Hi,
     
     I have a rather unusual Porsche, it's a 944 turbo SE 'Silver Rose'. 
     This car was made as a special limited edition to celebrate the 
     Porsche cup series in 1988. 
     
     I'm a member of Porsche Club great Britain and our register would be 
     interested in hearing from anyone who has any info, brochures road 
     test etc of this car. 
     
     At the recent PCGB national meeting 6 examples of this car attended 
     and every one seemed to be different in some detail so if anyone has  
     a definative list of the technical specification of this car it would 
     be a great help.
     
     I also have a personal requirement. Does anyone have any information 
     as to where I can obtain some cloth to recover the seats in this car. 
     The factory want to charge approx. 180 GBP per square metre of fabric, 
     (I guess thats about $300). So if anyone knows of an outside source 
     I'd be very interested.
     
     Regsrds,
     
     Steve Cox.
