First and foremost, from what I can tell in NC (similar to AL), pick-up trucks
come standard from the dealer with coolers and empty Budweiser cans in the back.
Second, get your horn fixed.  In some states if you are found even partially
responsible for an accident you can loose your rights to compensation.  On the 
other hand, there are other states where blowing your horn before the accident 
has caused trouble for the unfortunate driver.  The argument was, he should have
laid on the brakes instead of the horn.  The moral of the story is, don't kid
yourself, lawyers have this country by the cajones and you need one in almost
every situation to get a fair shake, especially since the other guy (or his 
insurance company) probably will have one.  Get your hork fixed, get a repair
estimate from someone you trust to fix your car as it should be fixed and 
present it to the pick-up driver.  If he does not faint, does not mention his 
insurance company, and does not keep his wallet and his dog on a chain, you
might get satisfaction without a lawyer.  The witnesses may come in handy.
Don't loose them.

As far as the repairs paid for by his insurance company are concerned, I think
you have the right in all 50 states to have genuine Porsche parts used.  
However, the cost of these parts might "total out" your car.  His insurance
company may say your 1986 944 is only worth about $5000.  Liberty Mutual tried
to give me $2500 for a cherry 931 many years ago.  Lawyer enters: stage right.

Believe it or not, AL probably has a higher fraction of honest folks than the
national average, but a lower fraction of folks that can actually pay for
Porsche repairs.  If AL is anything like NC, the guys net worth is about 10%
more than the value of his truck, minus what he owes the bank on it.  The look
on his face when you present the repair estimate will tell it all.

Good luck.  If you do get in a p*ssing match with his insurance company......
