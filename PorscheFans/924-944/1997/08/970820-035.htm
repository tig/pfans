Lee,

  According to the 944, 944 S2 & 944 Turbo Owner's Manual, concerning 
"Sekuriflex" windshields, "They must not have gummed labels put on 
it". They also say that no abrasive agents or dry methods should be 
used to clean the windshield. They state that only "normal drug store 
alcohol" should be used to clean very dirty windshields. Also, keep 
all "hard objects" such as jewerly or wristwatches etc, away from the 
plastic coating. Apparently, this coating is very fragile!
  To mount any labels or stickers to the windshield a "foil base" 
must be applied to the windshield. What "foil base" we say??!! Well, 
according to the Manual, EVERY car has 3 of these "foil bases" 
included in the glove compartment. (You did say that you bought your 
car new, right? So I assume that you had them???) They go on to 
describe how to affix this "foil base" to the windshield with a 
mixture of liquid soap and distilled water. Then affix the 
label/sticker to the "foil base". To remove this, use this same 
solution to loosen the label/sticker or backing foil.  They also say 
that failure to use this method will result in damage to the 
Sekuriflex coating. 
  DAMN! WHY? I have a 91 951 with 3 stickers on it! One indicating the 
licence plate # on my car, one indicating when the inspection needs 
to be done, and one which shows my car is equipped with the  new type 
of catalytic converter, which allows me to drive around here in 
Germany when "Smog Alerts" are declared, instead of having to park 
it. (Except for driving to work, or going on vacation, I believe.) 
These are all required for US citizens who own/register cars and work for 
the Department of Defense here in Germany.
   Now, when I bought my car from Porsche AG last year, there was no "foil 
base" in my glove box. AND, I obviously FAILED to read the Manual 
completely. (Actually, I did read it, but skipped what I considered 
the mundane stuff $$$.
  Now, what to do?  I'm going to see my mechanic on Monday when he 
gets back from Urlaub (vacation). HOPEFULLY, he will have a solution. 
I was thinking that "Goo Gone" might work, but will wait until I talk 
to Herr Ollmann. UNLESS someone on this list has removed a sticker 
with no damage.
  George B., any thoughts on this problem??!!
