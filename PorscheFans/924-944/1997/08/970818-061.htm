|Hello,
|
|After seeing a post from a gentleman who is planning on selling his
|prepared '86 951, I am guessing that a prepared car is out of my =
budget.  I


|am looking to get a 951 for racing, and I suppose the only way to do =
that
|is to buy a 951 (for ~$7k, I hope) and add a cage and do the mods =
myself.
|I cannot see spending over $10K more for a car that has been prepared =
by
|someone else.  Does this seem like a better route, or will I just end =
up
|spending more than $10K to make my car competitive.  My plan is to run =
in
|the "stock" class of the PCA.
|
|

Hi, Bill,=20

I assume the by being "competitive" you want to finish higher than last =
place in your class.

If that is the case, $10K is an unrealistic budget to build at class F =
Stock PCA club racer (at
least, based on my observations locally...)  But, I might be mistaken. =
Perhaps prices are lower
in the SF Bay Area...

Good Luck!
