Ezra,

When I was test driving the 87 951 which I eventually purchased,
a friend of mine who had tagged along asked me if the car seemed
very fast.  At the time, I had to admit that it seemed like it 
was lacking power.  Once I'd been cruising the car around for a
while, I opened it up, pedal to the metal, coming out of a slow
corner.  There was that annoying (or endearing) instant of turbo
lag, and then the car just exploded into action, I swear, there
seems to be very little difference in perceived acceleration 
whether you are in third or fourth gear.  We rocketed up to about
125 mph and I said something like, "It's fast now!" with a 
stupid grin on my face.  I think that especially if it is your
first drive in a turbocharged car you will think there is something
missing at the low end.  It is probably the effects of a light
foot, low compression, and less crisp throttle response than you are
accustomed to in an NA car.  (I still miss the 7200rpm shriek
of my Honda Civic).
