Yes, right now they are the top club racer (from BMW).  I am planning on
getting a 944T in the near future (for a track car) and then I will be able
to compare the two.  My E30 M3 is just too nice (and valuable) to see any
hard-core track driving....  I am confident from my track time (limited in
944Ts so far) that the E30 M3 is a much better balanced car, but with some
work the 944T can be a killer (as seen at many PCA events.)  I suppose on a
tight track the E30 M3 will have the advantage, but on a wide open track,
the 944T has the power to pull away...


>BTW, hey Bill, how 'bout an insider price on a SmartCamber gauge?!?

If you want to give me an insider price on your car.  ;-)    
Seriously, if you can get a group of people, I can give you a discount.  As
you probably know, it is the camber tool of choice by most racers.
