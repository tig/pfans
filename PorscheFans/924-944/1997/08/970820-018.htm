Mark, and others...

I have removed the turbo, I removed it about a month ago (that time when
everyone got unsubscribed from the list).  I'm still in the process of getting
everything back together.

I apologize for the lengthy time delays for my turbo removal.  I've been making
numerous trips for work, so I haven't had a lot of time to write details about
the removal.  A removal process paper is in the workings, so hold on everyone!!

I would definitely do it again if I had to.  The reason is because now I know
how to remove it.  Knowledge/experience is a valuable thing.
