Some call it Sekurit, some Sekur-Plus.  Instead of the standard laminated
glass that one finds on most cars (ie glass, flexible plastic, glass) the
Sekurit has another layer on the inside.  This way, on a really violent
crash when both layers of the glass are compromised the inner layer of
glass does not fall inside the car but stays put.  Mercedes and other
German car companies use this.

As for the tint, I have not idea where it is.
