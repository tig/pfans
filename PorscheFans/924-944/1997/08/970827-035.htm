Hi
Don't know what others have replied, so here goes.
FWD better in terms of being able to pull car out of corner when either
oversteer or understeer exists.
RWD better in terms of straight line acceleration.
Much has to do with weight distribution of car - 944s etc aim for 50/50
(why gearbox is over rear axle).
Best solution is infinetely variable 4WD, but if manually controlled, too
hard if in a hurry, so traction control - all torque available to all
wheels which are not losing adhesion.  Cure for torque steer as well is
LSD/Viscous LSD and engineering to overcome inequal length drive shafts
etc.
SO, the answer is, neither and/or both are better, depending on weight
distribution and how smart the engineers have been.
Having driven both (and cars with lots of problems - eg FWD with Turbo and
enough torque steer to literally wrench the steering wheel out of your
hands and RWD with enough power to lose th back end in 3rd/4th unless you
put a sack of concrete in the boot) - I still favour FWD if good - but I
drive a 944 and love it.
Bottom line - are women better than men, no, they're different.
MHO only....IanS
