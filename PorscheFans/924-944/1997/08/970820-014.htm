I asked this question on the 911 board and never got an answer.  I have
a 993 and a 944T and they both have this problem.  I beleive it is the
window tint.  When looking at the windows from an angle there is a
spoltchy appearance.  I have seen this in many cars of all makes.  It
usually appears worse in the rear windows.  I am unable to remove with
any type cleaner I have used and I came to the conclusion it must be
inside the glass.
Is there a fix for this other than replacing the glass?  I don't know if
this bothers everyone that has this problem but I have always kept all
my glass clean and the splotches bother me much.  If this is the tint
what causes the splotching?(Humidity, Heat?)  Would there be recourse
with Porsche or the glass people?  Am I the only one who cares?
