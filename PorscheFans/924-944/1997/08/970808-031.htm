Well said, Bill, and I appreciate your response (I've been able to
generate little activity from the other list members).  I think I have
paid extra because of their guessing, but actually the car is acting
exactly as it did when I took it in.  I had noticed for about 2 days
before I took it in that the oil pressure was dropping to zero (I
thought it was at 1, but now I think it was just at zero), and it acts
the same now.

But now I have another question...  Maybe if I type it in capital
letters, I will get a response or two...

HOW DOES YOUR OIL PRESSURE DROP TO ZERO AT IDLE, THEN GO UP TO 5 BAR AT
SPEED?  ANYONE?
