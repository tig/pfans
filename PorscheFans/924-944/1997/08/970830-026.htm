This is in reference to a post concerning the install of an upgraded stereo
in a 944. The writer was considering Infinity Kappa's. I would suggest that
before spending the money on any speakers, you listen to several sets first.
I purchased 2 pair of the Kappa's and was very disappointed. I am running a
4volt amplified Alpine cd player w/ a Alpine sound field processer, 3 alpine
amps, and a 8 in bazooka tube. The kappa's were definately a weak link. The
highs were good, but the mids didnt cut it. 
I recently got crazy and spent $300 on a pair of ADS 4x6's. The difference is
incredible, I really enjoy my music and I have never heard nything like this.
My back speakers are now Polk Audio 2-ways and they are also much, much
better than the Kappa's. But this is just my opinion!  After spending nearly
$4000 on stereo system for a car I already spend too much money on, I figure
I should start saving my money for therapy!! But what the hell, when you love
a car they way most of us do, lets think of it as our unborn childrens
college education!!!
