OK, this is kind of embarrassing, but yesterday I was under the car
tightening the alternator belt when I noticed something odd.  To the right
of the oil pump (looking at the engine from the front of the car),
apparently attached to an engine mount, is a Thing.  It seems to be in
alignment with the "second" (outer) oil pump V-belt groove, but the Thing
also has two grooves.  Also, there's some sort of hose going to it (which
I can't really trace back) that runs into it.

Is this an air conditioner?  I can't get close enough to see if it says
"Nippondenso" or whatever on it (I can just barely see that the oil pump
says "ATE").

And while we're at it: I finally got everything back together after a
rebuild on my car.  Turned the key one position to check the electrics and
the oil pressure jumped immediately to ten bar.  So I figured (correctly)
that I had the wires backwards on the pressure sensor; I swapped them and
checked, it was okay (resting at zero bar).  Started cranking the engine
(pressure still at zero), no start.  Double-checked spark plug wires (3 &
4 were backwards - duh) and fixed them.  Cranked, not looking at pressure
gauge.  No start.  Cranked one more time, checked the gauge, it was at ten
bar.  Let go of the key and the pressure went back to zero bar.

My question: could this be a serious problem with oil blockage (like a
stuck oil filter or oil pickup hose) or is it more likely (my guess) that
I broke the pressure sensor somehow?

Thanks in advance.  Sorry for the length.  (I seem to say that a lot.)

Subject: 951 shifter slop
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I remember a particular post regarding slop in the 5-speed stick for 
     944's.  Does anyone remember what amount of slop or free play is 
     "acceptable" for a shift-knob on a 951 transaxle?  I'm referring to 
     the amount of movement that one is able to produce while the car is 
     either in gear or in neutral.  I can presently move my shift knob in a 
     tight little square pattern, and I think the square has gotten bigger 
     recently but I'm not sure if it's just my imagination.  What are the 
     dimensions of the "square" pattern that the rest of you guys are able 
     to produce (i.e. Does the top of your knob make a 1" x 1" square, or a 
     3mm x 3mm square?)
     
     And if a shifter is too loose (worn?), what's the probable cause and 
     recommended fix?
     
     Thanks
     Ben
