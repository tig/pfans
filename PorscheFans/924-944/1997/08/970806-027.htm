Barry:

    Great hearing from you.

     Wow, $16k for that beauty, huh?

     You're right though about the 911's, I guess.

      The point that I was trying to make was that, well...I make a decent
buck. I paid $9,500.00 for my 86 (yes, I overpayed...but it is so clean and
low miled) and ended up going for another $4,700. I did kind of think that if
I needed to get liquid for some reason (like to get a Turbo or a 911) I could
do it fairly painlessly. (Which is also what I told the wife, as I was
pouring dough into the 44...)
Turns out that I'm all wet with that theory.)
      I'm 36. I just feel bad for those 26 year old kids, just out of school
who want a shot at a Porsche and can find 44's all day long for 6 grand. I'm
not sure they realize that they are most likely going to go for their
lungs...and that once they do...there is no escape.

    Jeeze, sounds dark, eh?

Enjoy the ride!
(hey wait, isn't that a Nissan slogan...I take it back!)
