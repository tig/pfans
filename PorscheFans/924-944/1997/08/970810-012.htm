Regarding the disappointing 944S power curve, is it not a question of
what to do about it?   Clearly the cams/heads do not flow well until
the car is above 4000.    Mine feels kind of like a roughened regular
944 around town, but runs like a scalded cat on the track.   One would
think that one might spend head improvement money better on a 944S
than on an 8 valve, but only within fairly narrow limits, remembering 
that the later models were taken to the vario-cam.

I wonder if our membership has made any substantial improvements on
an S , short of beating up the clutch . . . ?
