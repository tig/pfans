Hello Dave

Was getting "mail returned" at my end so I decided to go through the list.

I can't believe the miles on your car!  Awesome!  It gives me hope
(ha!ha!).

Junkyard info:
    B&M Foreign Auto
    11700 Brandywine Rd
    Clinton, MD
    301-868-7440
    800-333-2621

Directions:
   Exit 7A (Branch Ave) off of 495 (Andrews AFB is exit 9)
   Branch Ave to Woodyard (take right onto Woodyard)
       (Branch Ave to Woodyard between 5-10miles)
   Woodyard to Brandywine (take left onto Brandywine)
       (Woodyard to Brandywine ~200 yards)
   Junkyard is on the left about 5-10 miles down the road

They have about 6-944's.  These guys don't know what they have
because most of the 944's still have seats, dashes, etc still in them
rotting away.  If the care is stripped, its because another 944owner got
there first! 

I'm planning on going down this weekend.  Maybe I'll see you there!

Good Luck
Karl
'87 944
