I agree whole heartedly with Ezra - The emotional factor is most of the =
time the overwhelming part that determines the car's value to a person.  =
I myself fell in love with the 944 when I was in college.  When I =
graduated in 1985, the 944 was the most beautiful car I had ever seen, =
and to me, still is.  The 951s and the later 968s are still the best =
looking Porsches ever made - Boxster included.  I only recently found a =
car I could afford to pay cash for so I wouldn't have to pay big bucks =
for insurance!

I too enjoy working on my own car and have only let the shop do work =
that I felt they could do better, usually because some special tool or =
facility was required to do the job right.  These cars are maintainence =
intensive, but really aren't any harder to work on than most other cars, =
in my experience.  You just have to get well educated before starting =
any repairs ( thanks to Excellence mag and this list, that's not hard ). =
 And believe me, once you start working on these cars you will =
appreciate the 10+ year old technology that most domestic manufacturers =
are just now touting ( powder metal con rods, iron coated piston skirts, =
rear-mounted transmissions, etc. ).  The 951s, although they don't have =
MAF, still represent the best turbo engine design I have ever seen in a =
production car.  And they stop better than they go.

And remember, the cost of parts have come down *dramatically* since =
Porsche implemented the Part Express program.  Hell, you can now get a =
*new* turbo head for like $500!  At least Porsche is supporting us =
people who want to keep the cars going!

I also think we PorscheFans should lobby Porsche heavily to re-instate =
the 944-concept and continue the breed.  I'll bet if Porsche re-instated =
the 968 and returned to the 2.5 liter turbo, 2-valve car ( I think the =
original is the best ), fixed the existing reliablity issues, and =
offered the car at a *competitive price*, they would sell tremendously.  =
I personally think the 924-944-968 line should have never died.  The =
only thing that killed it was cost competitiveness.  The 944 saved =
Porsche in the 80's and is still there largest seller.

The 944 is still the best production sports car ever produced.

IMHO,

Dean
