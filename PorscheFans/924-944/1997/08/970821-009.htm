These lenses do not have the three little protrusions on the glass and are
not DOT-approved themselves.  It has nothing to do with the H4, the
reflector design and everything about them is different than DOT.

As a data point, back in my days inside a 944S w/ 80W/100 lamps (very
carefully aligned and re-aligned) I happened to drive behind police cars
many times, never got pulled over or gotten angry looks from anyone ever. 
I also made sure that I did not floor it when I was behind other cars
since my non-474/030 944S would duck its rear end under heavy
accelleration.   I am not saying this to justify the 80W/100, when I do
this again I will use 55W/something, the point is the h4s will not get you
in trouble if you aim them right because of the wonderfully sharp
horizontal cutoff.
