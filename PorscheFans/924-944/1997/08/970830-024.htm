Stu, of the advertisers in Panorama I think Vertex (in Miami) has the best
price on a stock clutch set.  I have done this job myself a few times (also
on a friend's car) and I think the Haynes manual covers it pretty well (for
a non-turbo anyway).  There are a few unusual tools that will help.  A
slide hammer-type seal puller for removing the pilot bearing, a 12 point
(star) external socket for the CV joint bolts (if you need to replace the
flywheel you will need a larger one for these bolts), a transmission jack
or a trans adapter for a hydraulic jack is very helpful.  I would recommend
having two hydraulic jacks handy for helping to position/support the torque
tube (especially at reassembly time).  I would also recommend putting the
car up on 4 car ramps.  It's very stable and gives you plenty of clearance
for a creeper.  A long breaker bar (with 90 deg swivel) is a must for
getting those upper clutch housing bolts out (probably the most difficult
part of the job).  A clutch alignment tool is nice but I have found that
nothing beats having the clutch pedal depressed (after bolting the slave
cyl. back on of course) while guiding the driveshaft back into the clutch
spline.  This lets the clutch disk 'float' around a bit and makes it easier
to get the tip of the drive shaft back into the pilot bearing.  That's
about all I can think of.  Let me know if you run into trouble.  It's not
an easy job and will probably take a full weekend.  Good luck.
