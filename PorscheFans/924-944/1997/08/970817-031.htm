In my '93 968 Cab the center console (next to driver's right elbow or hip=
)
has a compartment for a couple cassettes and also stores the device to
lock/unlock the top.  The plastic that holds the console lid is splitting=

so
will need to be replaced, sooner or later the cover will just break off.

I have contacted my friendly Porsche dealer but experience tells me I won=
't
like the price he quotes me.  Any suggestions for replacing this part ...=
 a
good source to order from and approximate price?  Anyone with the same
problem?

Daniel,

Sooner or later everyone has this problem.  Both my 87 951 (hinge almost
broken off) and 89 S2 (hinge broken) have this defect.  Would of thought
they would of solved it by '93.

Try the dealer, I have heard the replacement hinge and tray (minus casset=
te
holders) is under $20.  If you  have no luck there, Auto Atlanta has them=

for $20.  Soon as the boneheads from UPS get back to work, I will order
one.
