Dear Pfans

I am in the process of tidying my recently purchased 1985 NA 944(no sunroof). 
Thanks for all the help over recent weeks. 

I am looking for a publication that includes exploded diagrams and part 
numbers etc. I have a Haynes, (US version since Haynes do not publish a UK 
version)manual which is ok so far as it goes. Is there a 'Bible' published 
that I can obtain over here in the UK . 

The rear hatch will not release with the electric release mechanism. The motor 
and gears work, although very noisily and the mechanism moves across to 
release the nose cone part attached to the tailgate. There appears to be a 
lack of 'spring' in the system to allow the tailgate to lift. 
If someone operates the release while I hold the tailgate  I can lift it 
easily which suggests the adjustments are ok.
The seal does not leak
Could it be that the tailgate struts provide part of the initial spring and 
they are worn out?
The bonnet(hood) ones certainly are.

Inside the left side front wing there is a plastic mud shield at the front. 
Should there be one on the right hand side, (windscreen washer bottle side).

The bracket holding the front moulding in place was bent when I bought the 
car. Removing it and straightening has removed a slight bulge that was on that 
side of the car. 

Is the electric aerial motor meant to be exposed?, i.e. no mud shield. Mine 
has been replaced with a non motor type.
I want to fit an electric one. Can anyone recommend a good make?

Could I fit central locking?
