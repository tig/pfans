Here's a little advice for all you shade tree mechanics, born of three 
recent track-side repairs to friends' cars.  On 944's, the power 
steering pump belt and the polyrib alternator belt are both tensioned 
by turnbuckles having eyebolts at each end.

When you tighten or loosen these turnbuckles, it is absolutely 
mandatory that you first loosen the through-bolts through their 
eyebolts.  Think about what goes on here: as the turnbuckle grows 
shorter or longer, its ends pivot around their throughbolts.  If you 
don't loosen the latter, two things happen.  First, you will bend, 
stress, and eventually break the eyebolts.  Second, you will have to 
force the eyebolt threads inside the turnbuckle body.

You may notice on your car that one or more of the eyebolts isn't true, 
or doesn't thread easily in and out of the turnbuckle body.  This is 
the product of someone not following the above advice in the past. 
 Replace the part before it leaves you stranded.

By the by, the alternator belt turnbuckle originally had M8 hardware, 
upgraded by Porsche to M10 at some point.  If you find you have the old 
style turnbuckle, you should give some thought to an upgrade.
