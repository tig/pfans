<< I have a question about the overall value of my car which I would welcome
 some comment upon. Last month we bought, at auction, for $3500, a 1984
 Porsche 944 w. 160K miles. With a modest decent stereo, new tires, and lots
 of "housekeeping" superficial little things (brakes etc.) the total is up
 to about $5000. No expensive noises, and the car seems to have been pretty
 well maintained; after some work w. lubricants and a screwdriver, most of
 the vibration has stopped, etc.
 Did we get bilked? >>

Neil,

Well, if you got bilked, so did I.  I bought my '84 944NA six months ago and
it had 127K miles . . . . . I paid $5000 for it.  The car is in VERY good
shape both inside and out.  The rugs, upholstery, dash, body, etc. are really
nice and the PO kept it very well maintained . . . . . all services done as
needed.  The only things I need to attend to are a slightly worn gear shift
leather boot, my tires are nearly ready to replace and there are some rock
chips on the hood.  Everything works!
