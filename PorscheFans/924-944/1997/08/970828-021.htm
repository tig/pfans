Hello all,

     First of all, I would like to thank everyone for such an 
informative and entertaining list.  I don't know where I would be 
without it.

    Secondly, I have a question about sythetic oils.  I am considering 
synthetics in the transaxle.  Has anyone had any experience with this. 
Does it seem to ease the shifting in colder climates?  I was also told 
(or read somewhere) that sythetics make the vehicle more prone to leaks.  
Is this true or does it only pertain to older vehicles (pre 1980)?  
Should I also consider sythetics in the engine?  If so, what weight?  I 
am currently using Valvoline 20-50.

Your thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated...
