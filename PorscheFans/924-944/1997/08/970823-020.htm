Hi all,
	Can someone tell me, in idiot fashion, where the twin horns are 
located on my 88 951.  I haven't found anything useful in the manual yet 
and boy is it packed in that engine compartment.

	PO had installed a Momo wheel and, as I am discovering, an 
aftermarket air horn which was triggering by a NO switch on the 
dashboard.  The idjits who installed my alarm cut out the switch and cut all 
the wires leading to the horn a couple weeks ago.  I didn't really care as I 
was replacing the steering wheel with an OEM and wanted to go back to 
stock.  But when I hooked up the wheel and contact switch, no horn.

	So far, I've found the aftermarket air horns and it looks like they 
added a whole new circuit for it.  Next step is to start checking the OEM 
circuit.  My plan was to put a meter across the horn contacts and see if 
they get juice.  If not, work my way back from there to the relay and then 
the steering wheel.  Any input?

I checked the obvious.  Spring loaded contact in the contact plate looks 
okay, contact ring is clean, tried both buttons (with ignition on), and 
connector is tight.
