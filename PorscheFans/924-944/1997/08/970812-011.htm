I am still seeking some good phone dial or Fuchs
wheels for an 86 951...

Does anyone (hey Farzann where have you gone, I miss the arguments) have
the data on the chips that Farzann tested with his 951?  I would
like to see his comparison run graphs.

I am looking for the aftermarket glass roof that was available
for the 944s.  Anyone have one?

I have 2 computers for sale, well, actually 3.  The 2 engine
management computers I have are out of an '86 951, but will
work in '86 '87 '88 944 Turbos.  I really need to sell these,
but will consider a trade for wheels.  Best offer!  I also have
an Acer DX2 66Mc computer, lots of RAM and 500Mb hard drive for sale.
Comes with monitor and modem.  Best offer.

Doug - I have not forgotten about you either.  Just deposited money
yesterday, will write a check tonight.

Dana
