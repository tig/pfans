A parsec is 3.26 light years or about 48,900,000 fill ups @ 30 miles per 
gallon.  Remember to save your gas receipts.

Actually, the type of star drive used in Imperial and Rebel Alliance
vessels warps / folds  the fabric of space, and depending on the power
of the engines involved can make a trip longer or shorter by the amount
of folding that can be accomplished.  Therefore, since the 'falcon has a
very powerful drive for a ship of its displacement, trips become shorter
due to the amount of folding it can generate.  She made the Kessel run
in <5 Parsecs for this reason.

Bye the way, I don't think the Maus tank was ever really completed. 
Porsche did do extensive work on the Tiger II (King Tiger), developing
prototypes and a cast turret which was never actually used in production
(another supplier chosen).
