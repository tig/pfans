Hi Fans,
        My original question has generated a lot of discussion, some good,
some I do not agree with.  Unfortunately, I have not gotten any responses
from anyone who has this particular device and can give first hand info.
The ad appears to indicate that it is active and legal in all states except
three, which I assume have specifically banned them (manufacturer is in ND -
banned in NB, OK and MN all nearby states).  They state that blank displays
are not all that uncommon on radar guns, thus getting caught may not be that
likely..
        I can't imagine that jamming is that difficult as the reflected
signal is very weak since only perpendicular surfaces reflect back (remember
the stealth technology!), therefore, I think 100mW  might be enough.  They
claim 3 mile range - about right for this power.  The device does not have a
directional antenna,it appears to use a simple tuned antenna.  The
programmed set speed is another problem and I agree with Marv that this
would be very difficult to do, however, I do not know the specific design of
the guns so maybe there is a trick that works.

Laser is easy and legal to jam.  A local TV news program had a nice special
on this showing a small cylindrical tube on the top of the license plate
that sent out enough IR to prevent the laser gun from working.  The report,
trying to show that it's futile, showed the officer getting a reading as the
car drove away, but neglected to mention that this is easy to defeat by
putting one on the back plate too!

Anyways, I will resolve the question myself.  A friend and I have just
purchased two, one with the programmable speed and one without.  If they get
here in time before my vacation (pray for UPS to settle), I will be visiting
my brother back east who has a friend who is a cop with a radar gun.  They
have tested one of the passive jammers and demonstrated that it doesn't work
- the gun still got a reading off his 951.  If these jammers don't work, I
have 30 days to return them.  I will let the list know the results.

My efforts are not an attempt to break the law, I just feel that photo radar
is unfair and possibly unconstitutional.  I was caught in a group of 5 cars
by photo radar, all the others were going at least 5-10 mph faster than me (
I was not in a hurry). However, the two in front who had just passed me were
side by side and not photgraphed; neither were the two behind me gaining on
me.  I was the only one the camera got a clean shot of. (the cameras will
not shoot if they detect more than one car in their field of measurement).
Any live officer would never have stopped me as I was the only one going
anywhere near the speed limit.  Therefore, I just want to even the odds.
