  Face it, we speed because WE WANT TO! Rationalize it any way that 
makes YOU happy.

   While in theory, this sounds great. In actual practice, not 
usually so. Having lived/driven here in Germany for 17 out of the 
last 19 years, MY observations are: 

1. People WILL stay in the left lane at whatever speed IF they are 
passing vehicles on their right. I can be going 280 km/hr and they 
WILL NOT move to the right UNTIL THEY are satisfied that they will 
not be stuck behind these slower cars. 

2. Many people in the left lane are "dozers" as you so clearly 
stated. Again, on countless occasions, I'll be going FAST and will 
come up on a slower car who will take a minute or so to realize that 
I'm there. Then they DIVE into the right lane. 

3. There are people (Greens) here who will stay in the fast lane no 
matter what, doing 120 km/hr. WHY?? Because they are convinced that 
they are doing their part to keep the Earth environmentally safe. 
(Sorta like those people in the US who get in the fast lane and do 
EXACTLY the speed limit.) I call this the Police wannabe attitude. 
THEY KNOW they are doing the right thing and the hell with you.

  Yes, the roads here are usually in great condition, especially the 
Autobahns. To make me REALLY appreciate driving here, I go home to 
New Jersey for a vacation. My Porsches wouldn't last a mile on the 
Jersey turnpike! And yes, last time I checked Germany had the lowest
accident rate of most other Euro countries (of course a quick trip down the
Italian Autostrada will show you why).

  With only 30% of the autobahns being "unrestricted", the old days 
of virtually open roads is over. Usually the speed limits are 120 
km/hr (~75mph) on the restricted 'bahns. However, I live in the state 
of Rhineland Pfalz and it is probably the state with the most 
unrestricted autobahns. So I have PLENTY of open road to run my 91 
951 at 6.4K rpm in 5th gear. UNTIL I see a "dozer" in front of me!
