According to the factory manuals [my comments in []]:

From MY'89 and, in some cases, from MY'88, fixed calipers used in
conjunction with asbestor-free brake pads must be fitted with vibration
absorbers or suppressors. For allocation to the various types of brake
calipers, refer to Technical Informations GR.4 as well as the spare
parts catalog.

Since the suppressor have an adhesive coasting, they must be replaced
wherever the brake pads are removed or replaced [yeah, right].

Vibration dampers (suppressor plated with integral absorber weights)
must be coated with an adhesive backing. Always replace the vibration
dampers that feature a backing coat wheren the brake pads are removed
or replaced. [yeah, right]

For fixed calipers with scraper ring piston seals, a version without
coating should be fitterd with special double sided adhestive tape, 
scotch - 3M tape, (number 9485, width 38mm) [scotch tape? real
special!].

blah blah blah.

That said, it's probably about 50 - 50 for cars that still have the
vibration dampers and cars that lost them. I have them, a friend
doesn't. I don't think they do to much, if anything.
