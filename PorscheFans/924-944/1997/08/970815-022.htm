TO: Fellow fans
FR: Rick (87 924S)

Recently I had the opportunity (and took it) to by a 1955 Speedster
replica at a very reasonable price.  Desperately wanted a convertible
(Boxter out of my range at the moment) and fell in love with it a first
sight.  Its a dark green with black interior and seems to zip right
along with its modified 1600cc VW engine.

Of course it doesn't even compare to my 924S for sheer performance, but
its a blast nevertheless.  Has anybody successfully transplanted a real
356 engine in a replica Speedster?  Thought it would be even MORE fun
with a real Porsche powerplant.  I realize that this is the 924/944
page, but I know some of you guys have other toys too.

Just curious, Rick
