Yeah I'd agree with you there.  Thats probably what I meant when I 
said you get used to it.  I would 'drag' the clutch slighty when 
moving away from rest and give it about 3000rpm increasing throttle 
pressure as the clutch starts to bite.

Always worried that this would burn out the clutch very fast tho.  
However I had the same clutch for 2 years and I don't know how old it 
was when I bought it.  I just sold it on and it was still going 
strong.

Think the 16 valve problem has something to do with the 'venturi 
effect' or something.  Its making gas go faster through smaller holes 
I think.  I am sure there will be hordes of knowledgable techies out 
there who will have a much more precise answer than me.  You can get 
the 944S heads gas flowed but this is big bucks I am told.

How did they manage such an improvement on the S2 then?  I never 
drove one but I am told it was loads better.  I know the 968 is 
better but this has the variocam gizmo.  Any ideas?

By the way thanks to all those who sent me advice about the alarm 
LEDs.  The new system is being fitted today and they are quite 
confident that they can manage to get them winking.  I'll let you 
know the outcome.
