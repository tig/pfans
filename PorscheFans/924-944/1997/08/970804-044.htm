I need some help, a customer of mine wants to sell his 1988 944 Turbo S
#WPOAA2957JN151255.  It has very good original paint with a great body
(no apparent repaint), no engine or turbo modifications, original
wheels, etc.  Odo shows 117K and I am sure that the miles are correct. 
The motor is in sound condition, gear box is sound, and I am putting in
its first clutch right now.  The car is in very good to excellent
condition and is driven in Fort Worth, Texas daily.  The seats (front)
have been recovered and they are not the original cloth.

What is this car worth??  Any buyers??

Thanks, I need to know right away.
