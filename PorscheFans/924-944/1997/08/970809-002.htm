 I finally picked up my 944 N/A after purchasing it a month ago(PO went =
on holidays and I foolishly waited for his return :( ). Anyhow driving =
it back from Toronto to my place, 60 miles, was the first time I`ve =
spent driving a 944 for more than a test drive. It was the most =
enjoyable driving experience I have had, ever. Brought the car home and =
the next morning spent 5 hrs. removing all the old wax, then glazing and =
finally putting a coat of Carnuba on it. Then it happened, I said to my =
wife, take it for a drive. Well I`m sure glad I drove it back from T.O., =
I sorta think it was my last time behind the wheel. The children think =
that it`s the kewlest car they`ve ever seen. I suppose the only way to =
rectify this is to buy a 951S for myself, so into budget planning we =
go(happily for a change). This is a great source of information as well =
as a diagnostic test ground.

Regards

Mark.
