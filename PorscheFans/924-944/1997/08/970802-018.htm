Hi there:

Don't know if this was mentioned here yet, since some moron evidentally
unsubscribed me from the list.. I know who you are and you know it,
too.  Can we please stop this child's play?  Grow up.  Thank you.

Anyways.  On my way home from Toronto, I picked up the Excellence
magazine at the airport's newsstand.  In it, I found the Tech Forum
"Boost for 924s and 944s" on page 131-136 to be the perfect answer for
some of the more common frequently asked questions on this list.  That's
where we should point in the future when someone asks about this
subject.  It also has a somewhat brief backgrounder on turbos for the
uninitiated.

Who is maintaining the 924/944/968 related sections in the FAQ these
days btw?  I would like to volunteer some of my copious spare time(TM)
(Yeah, right) to it.

Best regards,
Chris
