Folks,

OK - I BELIEVE this, but I don't UNDERSTAND it.  Why
does it help to have the long direction of the contact patch
aligned with direction of acceleration?  The wide tire has
a shallow (front-to-back) but wide patch, while the narrow
tire has a deep but narrow patch.

I suspect the advantage is in the way patch shape affects
the tread's ability to stick.  I can rule out sidewall
factors as follows: To generate lateral acceleration,
the wide tire calls upon a thin section of the sidewall to
support the tread (since the patch depth is small)- the
narrow tire calls upon a wider section of the sidewall to
support the tread.  So the sidewall of the wide tire has more
concentrated forces on it -- doesn't seem helpful.

I don't know enough about rubber to understand how the shape of
the patch affects the tread's ability to stick.  Is there a tire
engineer on the list?
