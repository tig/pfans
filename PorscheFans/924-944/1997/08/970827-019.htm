Hi,

Of the two people who have looked at my '87 951 I have for sale, both of =
them have also noted something about the front bumper covers of some of =
the 951s they have seen which is something that also afflicts my car.  =
One side of the fender portion of the bumper cover sticks-out a little =
more than normal.  I have noticed this flaw on several 951s I have seen =
also. I have also seen 951s with both sides sticking out a little too =
much.

I'm guessing this may be caused by the polyurethane nose drooping a =
little, thus causing the fender portion to stick out a bit.  My bumper =
cover was replaced with a  used part though....  Anyone else noticed =
this or better yet - can it be easily fixed?

BTW - To contribute to the speeding thread, I'll quote my father's =
advice:
          'Ain't nothin' against the law - unless you get caught'.

Dean
