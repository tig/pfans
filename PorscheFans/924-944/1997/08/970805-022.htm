Howdy,

I saw an add for a '87 994 Turbo (951) in the Diablo dealer.  The price
seems too good to be true.  They are asking $7500 for this 134K car.
Sounds like a good car project track car (Just what I'm looking for!)  I
live over an hour from there, so I was wondering if someone was in the San
leando area and ia they could take a quick look.  I'd hate to drive all the
way there to see it is a complete dog.  BTW, the car is at a dealer (Luxury
Imports), so I am sure I am not getting completely honest information from
the sales guy.  He says it is in good condition but is getting its clutch
replaced.

TIA,
