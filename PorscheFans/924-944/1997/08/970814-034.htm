P-Fans,

I'll add my two cents about the looks of the 996.  As I mentioned a few
weeks ago, I've seen them in the flesh, and while they don't have the cool
flared rear fenders of the previous 911s, they don't look like "crap" and
they don't look like Honda Accords.  They looked damned tough, at least in
the dark gray paint jobs they all had.  However, I'm not sure how good they
would look in brighter colors.  

Enough's been said about the engine. It's race-proven, and a Porsche
engineer traveling with this Porsche test convoy seemed pretty sincere when
he said that it'll be the most reliable and best all-around Porsche yet.  

From the rear, the 996 definitely looks like a 911.  From the side and
front - well - it's different.  I'm personally not sold on the side view.
As the Porsche engineer said -- "You're all going to have to get used to
it."

Anyway. So maybe they just don't look as good in photos.
