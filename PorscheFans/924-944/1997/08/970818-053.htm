Arrrgh! Danger - Pet Peave Warning.

I like good headlights as much as the next guy (I have the Hella H4's too). But why do you wish to increase the wattage of the LOW beams? Did the rest of us drivers do something to piss you off? I can understand the high wattage high beams but please don't up the lows.
While I'm at it I hate drivers you leave their driving lights on all the time. I used to have 80 watt high beams and 100 watt driving lights (many relays) and I was extremely consious of not blinding people, however, if an idiot kept comming at me with driving lights on I would eventually (Usually at about 100 ft) agree with the other drivers opinion that driving lights were necessary and turn mine on. Hmmm, I guess that qualifies as Road Rage!!

Just my thoughts!!
