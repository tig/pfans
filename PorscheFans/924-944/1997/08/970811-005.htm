<<But now I have another question...  Maybe if I type it in capital
letters, I will get a response or two...

HOW DOES YOUR OIL PRESSURE DROP TO ZERO AT IDLE, THEN GO UP TO 5 BAR AT
SPEED?  ANYONE?>>

Hi Allen,

You got my attention anyway...

The oil pressure at idle once the engine has gotten hot will be
considerably less than the oil pressure when the engine is cold. A
friend once commented that the oil pressure gauge appeared to be
functioning as a backup tachometer!

Except for one occasion, I have never noticed mine to be as low as zero,
and I'd be willing to wager that since your engine continues to work
that yours isn't actually zero either. I'd suspect a bad gauge or
sending unit. The one occasion that it did read zero was immediately
after an oil and filter change. It sat at zero for what seemed like
forever. I switched it off and desperately called my
mechanically-inclined friends. After being convinced that oil pumps
typically do not fail just after oil changes, I crossed my fingers and
turned it on again. After 6 or 7 seconds, I got oil pressure.

The 944 owner's manual states that you should have 4 bar at 5K rpm and
it can be as low as 0.5 bar at idle.

I haven't read your other concerns since you didn't shout, but I'd
definitely recommend taking my car to someone who has experience with
them. As a simple test, ask to see their belt tension gauge.
