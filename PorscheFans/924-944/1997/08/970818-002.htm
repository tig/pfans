I can't claim that I am an aggressive driver or use my car for track 
events, but my 89 Turbo seems to stop fine, hot or cold, with the metal 
masters.

Dust is reasonable and I can not notice any difference with these pads.  
I put a set on the front of my 944S as well.  I used that greasy kid 
stuff on the back of the pads and have no squeal at all.

If your braking needs are stringent, you might consider upgrading your 
front calipers to the Turbo S style (I think they are the 928 S4 
calipers).  The best way to do this is to get a set of Turbo S spindles, 
but I have seen adapter blocks for the incredible price of $240!  I would 
think that you could buy a set of used spindles for not much more than 
that.  Of course, you will need to replace the rotors with Turbo S 
versions as well.  I would hesitate cross drilling at first.  You may 
find that the 33% larger front pad area more than enough stopping power 
for your application.

I have heard that cross drilling is a bit chancy.  Perhaps your contact 
that did yours knows some tricks that these after market versions don't 
(I have heard they will shatter).

If you are really sold on cross drilled rotors, Porsche makes a version 
that are cast, not drilled.  These are said to be much better quality and 
are resistant to shattering.

Just some things to think about.  Good luck with your Turbo!

>First, the Brake Stuff:

>Specific application is a 1988 951 but I would appreciate info from anyone.
>Looked in the FAQ but didn't find much.
>
>Looking for new Brake pads for street use.
>
>Constraints:
>1) Brakes Very Well when Cold
>2) Low dusting
>3) Not too much fade
>4) Pad wear not important
>5) Rotor wear not important

>Is this combination available?

>I have heard both good and bad about Carbon Fiber.
>How are they cold?
>Do they dust?

>Pads I have used:
>Porsche Pads:		Ok when cold, lots of dust, Ok fade.
>Repco Metal Masters:	Terrible when cold, Virtually no dust, Very good Fade.
>Rofren:			Very good Cold, Lots of dust, OK fade,

>I am using Cross-Drilled and slotted rotors. I originally bought them because

>Actually I found a guy who would sell me a new pair of German rotors with

>Anyway, I also told him that I was looking for a street pad that works well
>cold. I had been using Repco Metal Masters on all four wheels but I think
>they are just too slow to heat up for normal, street driving. You really pay
>a penalty with those things when using them cold. When they're hot, they seem

>Metal Maters (which he said means they have similar fade characteristics) but
>that they had a 'softer' metal and a coarser particle size which worked
>better when cold. Does this make sense to anyone? Anyone tried Rofren pads?
>Price was about $57.00. Reasonably cheap.

>On another topic, tires.
