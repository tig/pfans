Hi.

I am interested to know, does my '85 944 have an oilcooler ?
Is it capable of sustaining high speeds for long periods of time ?

The reason I ask is because I often travel at high speeds and sometimes
for sustained periods.

In my last car (bmw 325i) on one trip I averaged about 220km/h (on the
clock) sometimes going over 240km/h(150mph) for over an hour with no ill
effects (except higher than normal oil consumption). 
For those concerned about safety it was in the early hours of the
morning on major highways with almost no other cars present.

What I want to know is, is it safe to do this in my 944 ?

Thanx
Daneel
