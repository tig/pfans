I assume that Mr. Svensson broadcasts to these "netwaves" from Sverige (or
Sweden in English), because of the trailing se in his email address.  In
Sweden, the statement made about police and the speed limits may be
accurate. 

However, in the state of Missouri and I believe in the whole of US of A,
_nobody_ is allowed or supposed to be above the law. PERIOD. 
Consequently, it is illegal for anyone to disobey the speed limits. This
includes fire trucks, ambulances, police cars, etc.  Excuses such as
emergency are a load of manure.  I had to take the Defensive Driving
course and the teachers were very explicit in how the speed limits apply
to everyone. 

As a re-inforcement to my statement, remember that is also the reason why
no ambulance, fire engine or police car personnel can force you to commit
a traffic violation by crossing a red light when they are behind you with
lights on and horns blaring(ie emergency situation).  If they get on the
loudspeaker and give you hell, take their numbers and report them, they
are trained to either go around vehicles or wait for the light to turn
green.  If you cause an accident by crossing a red light, no judge will
excuse you because it was an "emergency". 

Enough, that was much more than $0.02 worth...
