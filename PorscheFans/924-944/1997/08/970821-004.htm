I would enjoy a front-wheel drive vs. rear-wheel drive discussion, even if
it's not exclusively p-car related.

I was always under the impression that front-wheel drive is "safer" because
in this configuration there is usually at least 60% of the car's weight
directly over those wheels which provide both power and steering.  It is
alleged that as a result the front wheels are much more likely to retain
traction in wet conditions and it should be easier to regain control of the
car in case of massive oversteer.

After extensive contemplation i agree and Vic Elford seems to concur.  I
highly reccommend Vic's book "Porsche Performance Driving" if only for the
many fascinating and humorous anecdotes.  In his book, Vic talks extensively
about rally driving in icy conditions and mentions the finnish technique of
whipping a fwd car around turns.  Under these conditions fwd cars apparently
have an inherent advantage in that they can induce oversteer while under
full throttle with left-foot braking.  Vic also advocates an interesting
"fastest-way" method of getting a 911 around hairpin turns.  Check it out,
it may not be what you expect!  Let's just say that it involves entering the
turn by sliding sideways, while facing the outside of the turn . . .

But then there is the troublesome specter of "torque-steering" which all fwd
aficionados loathe but which none has been able to explain to me properly.
When i think about >200 hp being delivered to a set of wheels and those
wheels' rotating axis being turned i immediately picture myself in mechanics
class, staring blankly at the first three fingers of my right hand at right
angles to each other.  Ok, so there is a resultant force being exerted in an
undesirable direction.  What does this mean in a real driving sense?  How
does a Saab 900T handle at the limit?

I believe staunchly that rwd is infinitely preferable for performance cars
driven only very rarely on snow-covered frozen lakes by reasonably
proficient drivers.
But i'm not really sure why.  Frankly, the fact that Porsche, Mercedes or
BMW have yet to produce a fwd car is enough to support my faith.
