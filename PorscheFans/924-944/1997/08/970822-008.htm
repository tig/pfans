Steve:

I don't know how much of what I've been thinking of applies to your
case, since I've got an early 924 (with K-Jetronic), but I too have been
thinking of installing a ram-air system. I've got a mock-up of a scoop to fit
in front of the radiator, just under the bumper, measuring 10x2 inches. I'm
thinking of using 3" hose to duct up to the existing airbox. The biggest
pain that I see, aside from creating the scoop out of fiberglas, is running
the hose up there.

As a separate datum point, there happens to be a guy here who has a
5.0 Mustang with a very similar ram-air system. He uses a plastic scoop,
ducted up through his fender, to the stock airbox with a K&N filter. His
scoop is located under the fender on the right side, roughly where we're
thinking of. When I questioned him about the performance gains, he said
he gained about 0.2 sec. on the 1/4 mile. When you consider that he's
using a 5.0 liter engine, and I'm sure the gain is going to be proportional to
engine output, I don't think that means that we can realistically expect
more than a couple of horsies gain out of such a system.

So,before you go to all that trouble and expense, keep in mind that the
gain may be small, and obviously only at the top end. As for me, I'll be
fabricating everything, so the cost will be low, and I'll only have to waste
my time, when I get around to it, so I suppose I will do it. I'm more
interested in getting or making a larger throttle body first, though.

later...
