OK, OK, I'll reply.. ;-)  My oil pressure does not drop below 3 on the 
dash gauge, unless it is really hot outside.

No pressure at idle means a blockage in the oil system, a misbehaving
(sticking) oil pressure relief valve, or a catastrophic main or rod
bearing failure.  Does your engine have a deep knock, indicative of a 
bearing failure?

My housemate had an old '77 Mercedes diesel with over 200K miles on the
odometer, which mysteriously lost all oil pressure at idle, but was
acceptable at a very high idle.  After adjusting the idle up for him so he
wouldn't trash his engine (I could hear the wrist pin bearings in the
pistons starving and double clicking away, eeek!), I decided on a lark to
do an oil and filter change.  That cured the problem, turns out the oil
filter was defective and blocking flow through the system. 

Perhaps this story might apply to your case, FWIW.  It would be
interesting to see if a filter change would make a difference.  Use a
factory OEM Mahle unit.  There is no substitute.  (TM) ;-)
