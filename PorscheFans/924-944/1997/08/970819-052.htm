As the tow truck driver was loading up the car onto the flatbed, and the
car was at a significant uphill angle, not too much water came out of the
tailpipe, which was definitely a good sign.  Also, when I pulled out the
dipstick, I didn't notice any water droplets mixed with the oil, but that
doesn't mean that there wasn't a layer of water sitting under the oil.
When I pulled the air filter yesterday morning, it was dry as a bone, so
maybe no water got into the air intake.  But, the taillights were
definitely swimming.  In talking to the service manager at the dealership,
he indicated, at least, that the minimum (relatively speaking) amount of
damage had occurred as long as I had not attempted to turn over the engine,
thereby possibly trying to compress water internally.  You know how "zero
tolerance" systems can be in such a case.  As long as the insurance company
doesn't try to "total" the car, I should be able to come out alright - lots
of "new" parts (belts-properly tensioned; fluids-it was due for some
routine servicing anyway; brakes-calipers probably would have needed
rebuilding soon and I have a set of brand new slotted rotors for the fronts
which I was going to install over the winter anyway;possibly a new
clutch-as far as I know, the original one was still in place with 70k on
it-gotta make sure that is replaced with one of the "cup" style; probably
new water pump and starter; definitely new DME and KLR controllers-required
before even attempting a start).  Hell, if I can get all of the above new
parts to be paid for by the insurance company, I might even upgrade a few,
as long as I'll have a new "warranty" for a while.  I might even be able to
be competitive in timed events for a change.  Now, if they do try to
"total" it, and pay me full value, not just blue book, because of its
rarity, I'll try to buy it back from them at a greatly reduced price and
have some funds to really play around with.  Just in case, everyone keep
your eyes and ears open for a good original Turbo S engine and drivetrain
package.

I'll keep the list informed, and thanks again for everyone's concern.
