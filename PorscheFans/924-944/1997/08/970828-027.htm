Sorry to have started a discussion on police in this country.  My whole point
was the number of times that I have been stopped by the police when driving the
Porsche (6) vs. the number of times I have been stopped driving the Mercedes
(0).  I drive each about the same number of miles and about the same speed when
on the interstate system.

I always start out respecting the police - they have one of the toughest jobs
in the world.  How many news clips have we all seen where a cop stops a vehicle
for something minor and then gets shot.  They never know who is in the vehicle
they are stopping.  Like I said, they initially get my respect; it is their
behavior that determines the attitude they get back in return.  A very close
friend is a highway patrolman and he has seen it all.  He suggests that when
pulled over and you are speeding, say that it was such a nice day, you were
enjoying the day and that you are sorry that the speed must have crept up on
you  You weren't in any particular hurry to get anywhere.  Tried that technique
in Wisconsin and it didn't work so take this advice for whatever.  I have even
heard about keeping a dead bee in the car to throw on the dash as you are
pulled over.  Tell the officer that you had this bee fly into the car and you
were trying to get rid of it or kill it.

Also, if the highway patrol in Wisconsin were there for any other purpose than
revenue, why do they use VASCAR?  Can't they accomplish more by using RADAR and
leaving it turned on?  Then those with the RADAR detectors will slow down along
with other cars on the road.  They will still have more people speeding than
they can ever hope to write tickets for.
