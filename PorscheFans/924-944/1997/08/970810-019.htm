You should do your best to obtain a water pump locally or have one shipped 
Federal Express, then refuse the UPS shipment when it eventually arrives.

You are taking a great risk driving on a defective water pump.  It is
impossible to predict if the pump will continue to spin for another few
months, or seize tomorrow, forcing the smooth side of the timing belt to
slide on a stuck pulley surface, failure impending in short order.  The
two pumps that failed on my car started to have a rattley sort of noise
coming from the front of the engine instead of a squeal.  Interestingly 
enough, they never leaked.

Have you replaced your alternator or power steering belts lately?  Worn 
or misadjusted belts can squeal like a water pump.
