Danger! Danger! Danger Will Robinson!

I just experienced exactly the same over-springing from new hatch struts on my 
931.  You could hold your breath until the glass began to separate from the
frame up near the hinges.  The force from these struts acts to push the entire
hatch toward the rear of the car when the hatch is down.  The hinges take up
this force.  I too suspect the aftermarketers are selling one-strut-fits-all 
merchandise, and it can damage your rear hatch.  My car left Zuffenhausen almost 
18 years ago, so my glass-to-frame adhesive was probably weak already, but I'd 
keep an eye on the hinge area of your hatch if I were you.
