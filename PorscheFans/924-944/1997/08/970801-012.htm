I've decided to switch my 86 951 to 17" wheels next year.  Does anyone
have experience with a good type/brand that won't mind being autocrossed
without breakage?  Can a pressure cast wheel handle the stress?
I am keeping the engine stock for now, brakes stock, MAYBE an
Autothority Stage II (tired of fighting the tide)...
Car is being painted this week at Langford's in Indy.  I'll post pix of
the job they do.
Hope you all are well, watch the Brickyard 400 this weekend, no Ari/AJ
fights, promise!
If anyone needs an aux oil cooler, there is a place next door to me that
advertises in Pano.  I have seen the cooler they have for the 951 and it
looks VERY nice.  Their cooler mounts is series with the existing
cooler.If you are interested I will send you a picture...  I have not
actually installed the thing yet. 
Have a nice weekend!



FLAME:  Euro Motorworks of Indy told me I needed a new radiator
(didn't), that I needed two new computers (didn't), that I neede a TPS
(didn't).  I am under the impression that they are out to make the most
money possible there without actually fixing the problems, just
continuing them.  The owner said that he would call me back about buying
the replacement computers he had me go out and purchase, but won't retun
my phone calls.  If you need a good mechanic in Indy, check out Brian
Stewart at Autocar Sports and Classics...  Honest, ex Indycar team
mechanic.  Good rates.
