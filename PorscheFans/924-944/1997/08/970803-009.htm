Dear Fans,
A friend just showed me an ad for a radar jammer from a place called Jammer
Electronics.  It is disguised as a cell phone and isa purported to be a
legal (in all states except OK, NB and MN), active jammer for all radar
frequencies.  Is anyone familiar with it and does it work?  My brother got
the passive one advertized in various car mags and the Damark catalog and
tested it with a cop friend and it doesn't work.  Add says it even has an
option to send a false signal  to the radar with a selected speed (e.g., it
will tell the gun you are doing 35 no matter what you are doing).   I'm not
aware that it's legal to broadcast on most police radar frequencies.

Still trying to find a way to fight photo radar (they started the war!)
