The reason a wider tire improves cornering performance is because of
the contact patch shape (suprise!). As correctly mentioned previously,
the only things which will affect the size of the contact patch are the
weight of the car and the air pressure in your tires.  a skinny tire like a
155 80 R 13 will have a patch like an oval elongated in the direction of
travel. A wide tire (say, 205 60 R 13) will have a contact patch
elongated perpendicular to the direction of travel. This provides better
grip for cornering, since the contact patch is aligned with the direction in
which you're trying to accelerate the car. 

Of course, you could lower your tire pressures and increase your
contact patch area, but you'd sacrifice resistance to rollover of the
sidewall, which would make your handling looser and much worse.
Racing tires, OTOH, have stiff sidewalls to begin with, and so can be run
with lower pressures. That, combined with softer compounds, and all
kinds of other goodies, makes them stickier.

Hope this helps...
