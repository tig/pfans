A few more items are available from my 87 944S that is on to its new home in a few 
days:

Weltmeister (Dinan) Performance Chip. This chip increases the ignition timing and 
the air/fuel ratio on the 16V cars (otherwise it's non-adjustable on them) for a 
noticeable difference. It really smooths out the idle, too. Paid $239 (reg. 295); 
will sell for $175. Installs in less than an hour.

K&N Air Filter for the 944S. Everyone knows about these filters. They make the 
exhaust note a little louder, too. Paid $41; will sell for $25. Installs in 15 
minutes.

Oil Cooler Seal Kit. Never needed to install it (fortunately!). Paid $40; will sell 
for $25.

All have original packaging, receipts and instructions. Chip and Filter have only 
been on the car 2K miles. They're still new! Email me at ccc@mitre.org if you're 
interested. If someone would like all the items together, I'll pay the shipping and 
throw in my 944 Haynes Manual for nothing (hey, I paid 17 bucks!)!
