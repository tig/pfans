This is a good thought.  I was planning to give my new digital camera a 
work out capture the procedure on "film".  I would then marry that to a 
Microsoft Word document that would detail each step.

If this acceptable with White-Allen, I will try to put this together and 
make it available to all that would like a copy.  This format would lend 
itself to being electronically transferred (ie., E-mail) to anyone around 
the world.  Logistically, it would be easier to distribute than a video 
tape which would require receiving payments and then shipping.

No promises, of course, but I will explore the opportunity.

I would really like everyone that can possibly come, to make a personal 
appearance.  That is the best way to learn.  It will aslo be the most fun!
