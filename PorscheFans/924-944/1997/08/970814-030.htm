I think Bruce Anderson may have been referring to the life of turbochargers
in 930s, not 951s. I've read most of his technical articles from back
issues of Excellence (among other sources) and he does make the assertion
that 930s go through turbos frequently, especially in cars which aren't
driven daily. Needless to say, the 930 is a very different car than the 951.

I've never heard of such a short turbo lifespan in our cars. I've had two
'89 951s with more than 60k miles, both of which have original turbos and
no sign of needing replacement anytime soon.

I know several 951 owners on this list have replaced turbos...has anyone
had to do so before 50k miles?
