Unfortunately, Robert, Option 182 is not listed in my book.

Option M900, Tourist Delivery, is a way the purchaser can place an order
thru a dealer and arrange to pick the car up himself at the factory and
enjoy a European vacation in his own new Porsche.  There is usually about a
ten percent savings from the U.S. MSRP on the price of the vehicle itself
(not including options, which are charged at the U.S. MSRP), and generally
included in the Tourist price are (at least currently):
	Tour of the production facilities
	Lunch at the factory
	3 month touring pass from delivery date
	Vehicle registration
	1 month 3rd party liability and 2 week additional collision insurance
	Car preparation for transatlantic return shipping
	Return shipment of the new Porsche to the U.S.
	Vehicle pickup in the U.S. at the PDI center in Charleston, SC for
a nominal charge.
	Reimbursement of taxi fare from the airport to the factory in
Zuffenhausen

Pickup at the PDI will include safety-related damage inspection of the
vehicle, cleaning the vehicle's exterior and interior, and a full tank of
gasoline.  Inland transportation to the selling dealer is available to the
customer for the prevailing inland destination charge.

Hope this helps.
