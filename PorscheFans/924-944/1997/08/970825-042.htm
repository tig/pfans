Forgive me if this is a re-post but I did not see it get delivered:

I spoke with Sam Davis at the Porsche Commitment Calling Center the other 
day (800-238-7467) and got all of the details about my 951 as shipped.  The 
only thing that does not match this list is the radio option.  This car 
apparently was supposed to come with option R04 - RADIO W/CD PLAYER.  When 
I bought it the car had the Reno SQR AM/FM Cassette unit and the BEA-80 
equalizer.  Can anyone tell me what the standard R04 unit is?  Is the CD 
Player separate from the radio or was it all in the in-dash unit?  If they 
were two separate units, was there a cassette player in the radio?  And 
finally, for those of you who may have a late model 944 or 968, where does 
the factory mount a multi CD player when equipping a car with an AM/FM 
Cassette head unit and CD?

Thanks!!!
