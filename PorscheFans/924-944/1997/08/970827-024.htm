My $.02:

If tickets were given for dangerous driving or stupidity on the road then 
the laws would truly be there to protect the public.  As it is today every 
municipality knows that they can depend on citation revenue to bolster an 
already ailing budget.  On any given day a police chief can say to his/her 
men/women "go give 50 tickets each" and it would be simple to do.  This 
does not affect those who are reading and driving, putting on make-up and 
driving, or even driving rattletraps that loose parts as they go down the 
road (how many of you have seen large auto parts on the road and though - 
gee I am glad I did not hit that going even 10 MPH).  The latter two are 
especially problems in Georgia!  Now I temper these statements by saying 
that just two weeks ago I was stopped for doing 83 in a 65 at 4:30AM on my 
way to the airport.  The officer was very polite, as I was, and after a few 
minutes came back and asked me to slow it down a little - no ticket.  I 
think that there are many officers who use good judgment prior to writing a 
ticket and should be applauded but I have also been stopped by those who 
give tickets because they can.  Lets face it, it is a revenue source for 
state and city governments that will never go away.  I think that if reform 
is to be made that we should start with insurance companies!  My driving 
record is very clean except for speeding tickets and I am one of the safer 
drivers on the road.  I know my limits and the car's capabilities and don't 
think that there is a direct correlation to speeding tickets and risk of 
accident.  The statistics on the number traffic accidents decreasing since 
the speed limits have been raised are evidence of that!
