     Hi dear Everyone,
     
     now finally I can consider myself a 'wealthy man'. Living in Moscow 
     (we have a Porsche Club here) I was told that here you can only have 
     Porsche as a second car, not a daily driver... I've been driving my 
     924 daily for almost a year now, fixing it here and there once in a 
     while, and there was only one day when it did not start - at -30C the 
     water in the battery has frozen. Except this day it is a great 
     car...But when I saw and test driven this '87 944S we were going to 
     buy for a friend of mine (he finally got himself a '89 Turbo Probe), I 
     had to buy it. Now here I am with 2 PCars ( each of which can be 
     considered second car?) and mass of debts...
     
     Anyway, this 944S has problems - any input will be highly appreciated:
     
     1. Starter - gives bad noise while starting. I checked the mounting 
     bolts, but they seem tight. Do I need to buy a new one or can this one 
     be fixed somehow - of course if it is gear, I'll need to cahnge it...
     
     2. Power steering: did not have a chance to lift it yet, but the 
     liquid seems to pour from two sides of the rack, mostly when I turn - 
     I can see traces of liquid on the road.
     
     3. Rough idle - when I depress the accelerator, the engine can even 
     die, but if I press brake pedal - everything is OK. I would suggest 
     vaccuum leakage somewhere. Any potential places?
     
     4. I can even FEEL the engine vibrating in the drivers' place - engine 
     mountings?
     
     5. The right outside door handle is missing - any cheap place to get 
     one? (need it delivered to Houston TX)
     
     6. The oil pressure is 0 when the car if turned off, 2 while on and 
     does not depend of RPM. Guess something must be wrong here. Where is 
     the oil pressure sender located in this engine?
     
     7. Is there a mechanical heater regulator somewhere? It seems like 
     it's just a potentiometer inside, no mechanical temperature 
     regulator... And it's getting colder these days here...
     
     8. Is there a place where I could get list of all relays and fuses in 
     English? Don't read German unfortunatelly...
     
     9. Gas tank - smells like leaking while filled to the top. Any 
     potential weak places?
     
     10. Clutch pedal does not release itself to the end - the clutch 
     itself works just great, but the pedal stops after that... Will 
     bleeding help?
     
     11. The local guys could not find the engine number on it. Where can 
     it be? The guy from whom I purchased the car said he changed the 
     engine for '89, but I still feel like it's 87.
     
     12. Any other info on this kind of car is verry welcome - there is not 
     much info available locally and I hate to take the car to the only 
     dealer in the city - they are not doing very well as my experience with 
     924 shown....
     
     
     Sorry for a long note...Wow, what a problem car I got...But it's great 
     driving it...
     
     Thanks for any help,
     Please reply to vladimir_gainanov@sakenergy.ru or boba@winning.com,
     
     Regards,
     
     Vladimir
     '82 924
     '87 944S
     ..what next?
