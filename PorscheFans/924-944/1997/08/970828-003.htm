pressure transducer mounted directly to the PC board where the manifold
pressure line connects in order to measure boost pressure.  Just wondering
if it were possible that the aftermarket chip suppliers could be a little
'enthusiastic' when reporting the boost. ( Of course they wouldn't do that !)

should allow for the possibility that the KLR pressure transducer could
degrade over time.

I've done that. The stock boost guage is right on with my VDO guage. The
problem is that you can't read the stock guage over about 1.6 bar.
