On the oil change interval question.  While a distributor for Torco Racing Oils,
we did a lot of testing on oil change intervals.  Torco synthetic is the same
base oil as Mobil 1 with a few more additives (MPZ) and after running it for
20,000 in a heavily laden oil delivery vehicle, we sent it off to be tested, and
showed no signs of breakdown.  Now I know that Turbo's generate a lot of heat,
but a lugging engine pulling heavy weight does as well.  My motorcycle is
turning 11,000 rpm's regularly, the engine oil is also the transmission oil
(shearing forces), and has a wet clutch that uses the same.  I use conventional
oil, because synthetic slips the clutch and after 7500 miles it doesn't break
down either (had it tested).  I'm sure that bike beats up it's oil more than any
car could.  Anyway, I have no problem changing my oil every 7500 or 10,000 miles
if its synthetic, and 6000 on conventional.  The 3000 mile change interval is
dictated by the greedy people who sell the oil.  The testing I've seen and/or
had done didn't show a need for such changes.  Torco recommends changing the
synthetic every 19,000 miles and if you have a remote filter installed so that
the filter can be changed without draining the oil you can double that.  Just
food for thought.
