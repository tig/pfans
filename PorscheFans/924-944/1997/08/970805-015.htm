Hi Kevin,

I don't really know if it's a automatic mark against a car if it's been =
re-titled.  Like you say, it depends on the reason the title was pulled =
and if it was a crash, the extent of the damage and the quality of =
repairs.  In my case, I thoughly inspected the car before any repairs =
began.  And I took pictures of the pre-repair state of the car.  My car =
was an easy fix labor wise - finding parts at a reasonable price was the =
hard part!

Realize too that these car's are not inexpensive and some have picky =
owner's (sorry guys - they are *German* cars). In most cases, insurance =
companies are forced to use all new parts because it's the law that an =
owner can require new replacement parts.  Porsche parts, especially body =
parts, are very expensive.  I checked on a new bumper cover for my 951 - =
as I remember it was $1800 - and you still haven't purchased any =
foglights, turn signal lenses, etc.  And most owner's of these type of =
cars would *insist* that the whole car be painted.  I know I would if my =
951 was in the pre-crash shape mine was in.  There are some very =
expensive bits - headlight mechanism, intecooler, radiator, etc. - that =
are easily damaged in a front end collision.  The 944 series is an easy =
car to total!

The NADA value of a used '87 951 in excellent condition with low miles =
like mine is about $11-12K.  I don't know if most individuals average =
more or less than this in a sale, but it's probably a retail price.  I'm =
guessing most 951s of this vintage sell for around $10K.  Realize though =
that there are a lot of ragged-out 944s out there.  Nice one's are hard =
to come by.

So it depends on you confidence in the quality of the repairs (if any) =
and the confidence you have in the professed history of the car.

BTW, my mom has been driving re-built salvage cars that my dad has =
repaired since 1988.  Her first was an '87 Taurus (my aunt now drives =
it), a '92 Honda Accord ( totalled twice - she was hit in the Honda, the =
other guy's insurance paid for it, dad fixed it back again! - Now my =
cousin's wife drive it) and finally a '92 Lincoln Towncar.  All these =
cars were low mileage, excellent condition cars pre and post repair.  =
She is really spoiled now on the cheap transportation.  And dad's fixed =
many Mustang GT's over the years - the real breadwinner.  (If 944 =
salvage parts were so cheap and easy to find).

Another thing to consider - Most states (Georgia included) have really =
cracked down on the amatuer salvage repairers.  The horror stories of =
two 280Zs welded together ( on good front, on good back ) have forced =
strict compliance with build quality and safety laws.  All re-titled =
cars now go through a strict inspection before re-titling and all =
pre-existing safety equipment must be re-installed (air bags included) =
before a car can be re-titled.  There *must* also be photographs taken =
of the car before repairs were started.  So I would say that a car =
rebuilt in the last few years is a safe bet, *if* you check it out =
completely.  Check for the laws in you state.

Anyhow, I don't think any buyer should immediately shy away from a =
salvage titled car.  Just inspect the car well and look for *complete* =
records on the repairs and history of the car.

J. Dean Roberson:

 Just a note to get a little advice. I too own an '87 944 that is titled =
as a
previous salvage. It is also time for me to part with my baby. Judging =
by
your post you and your father have extensive experience with rebuilding
previous salvage titled autos.  Specifically how does having an auto =
with
this classification affect value in relationship to actual Kelley book =
or
NADA value?

  I am in a very similar boat, as long as I have owned car it has been
meticulously cared for, all work performed my local authorized Porshce =
dealer
and myself, including all preventive maintenance belts; waterpump ect. =
It has
been inspected by two different dealers and they have no ideal why it =
was
salvaged, they also will not even hazard a guess. The previous owner
hypothesized that it was a previous theft as the interior work has a few
signs of being taken apart and re-assembled.=20

Any light you might be able to shed would be much appreciated as I don't =
want
to 'give' my baby away come sale time. I am close to just trading it off =
so I
won't have to deal with making excuses for a care that is near excellent
shape.

Thank you and take care.
