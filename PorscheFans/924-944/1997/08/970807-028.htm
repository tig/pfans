Bill,
     If you replace your tires or wheels with non-stock sizes, you can easily 
calculate the speedometer ratio..

speedo ratio = (Stock tire circumference)/(New tire circumference)

=
 2*pi*(stock_width*stock_profile+stock_wheel_radius) 
-----------------------------------------------
  2*pi*(new_width*new_profile+new_wheel_radius)

=

  stock_width*stock_profile+stock_wheel_radius)
-------------------------------------------
    new_width*new_profile+new_wheel_radius


For example,

On my '86 944, I believe the stock rear tire size is 215/60 VR 15, So:
    
   stock_width         = 215mm = 8.465in
   stock_profile       = 0.60
   stock_wheel_radius  = 15in/2 = 7.5in

If I replace my rear tires with 225/50 VR 15's:
   new_width           = 225mm = 8.858in
   new_profile         = 0.50
   new_wheel_radius    = 15in/2 = 7.5in

This gives me a speedo ratio of:

(8.465*0.60+7.5)/(8.858*0.50+7.5) = 1.055 (the reading will be 5.5% fast)

For example, if you are traveling at a real 75mph, your speedometer will read:

75mph*1.055 = 79mph

and your mileage will accumulate at an accelerated rate of 105.5%, ie for 
every 100 miles traveled, you will clock 105.5 miles on the odometer. Also 
note that tire pressure and sidewall stiffness will influence your effective 
tire radius and therefor your speedo readings, and the above analysis.

On the rear I have 225/50 ZR 15 D40 M2's          (radius=11.93in)
On the front I have 205/50 VR 15 Pirelli P700Z's  (radius=11.54in)

The P700Z's were $71 each at tire rack, I couldn't resist, but you should. One 
of the tires had a flat spot as it came from the tire rack brand new! This 
flat spot was located right where the mold pieces must have met as there is a 
seam there. This makes for some interesting but subtle chassis vibrations at 
high speeds on smooth roads as the front and rear tire harmonics go in and out 
of phase.... I am not particularly fond of the D40M2's either.

have fun..
Ezra
