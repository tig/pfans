Well, if you're going that far into it to fix the crank and main and rod =
bearings, you need only spend
another 10 minutes removing the balance shafts to see what they look =
like...

Sounds like you will make your mind up after you drop the motor and =
dismantle it to see all that is
needed...

Good Luck!

|I have a 1982 944 (European Model) LHD imported from Germany to =
England.
|It has around 200,000 Km on the clock and the oil pressure is getting a =
bit
|low ie. 40PSI fully warmed up at 4,000 rpm. I was driving home from =
work
|yesterday from Cardiff to Bristol coming up to the old severn bridge, =
Its a
|pretty good bit of road.
|I had been thrashing it  up to 220KM(135MPH) flat out passing a couple =
of
|old MGB's as if they were standing still thinking "hah rusty old =
English
|sports cars". When I noticed that the oil pressure had started to =
reduce
|and the flickering temp guage was flickering towards the warm end, I
|started to slow down & noticed that putting my foot on the accelerator =
had
|no effect any more, I could not hear the engine very well as I had both
|windows open and the roof out, the wind noise was incredible as my =
sunroof
|wind deflector is missing. I put the car into neutral and coasted to a =
stop
|on the hard shoulder but at the last second I could hear a clattering
|sound. The engine temp was bending the needle & the engine would not =
turn
|over, It felt a bit stiff. After an hour of turning the crankshaft by =
hand
|& a long knuckle bar to free it up the engine had cooled down a little =
&
|would start but it sounds terrible, there is a loud knocking noise from
|some where but the oil pressure light still goes out. I presume that =
the
|main bearings have gone, does any body think I would get away with just
|changing them & getting the crank ground or do you think the =
cam/balance
|shaft bearings will be damaged as well, before this I had very good
|compression & used hardly any oil.
|I feel confident enough to strip the engine and replace any worn parts =
but
|is it best left to a professional engine builder ?
