Don;

        Thanks for the comments!  I took a 22mm socket (1/2" drive) and
dremeled flat spots on opposing sides so my vice grips could get a decent
bite.  The 7mm socket could then be fit through the drive hole as you
describe.  But it was still quite hard to get loose.  My biggest problem -
and complaint against engineering designed to make us unable to do jobs
ourself - is the sheer impossibility of tightening the new Konis without an
impact wrench.  That is where the bent tools come in as Jason at Paragon
kept insisting that they had heated and bent a 22mm box end wrench so that
it would fit down in the "cup" so that the 10mm flat on the Konis could be
held while the 22mm nut is tightened.   No matter how I bent the wrenches I
was destroying, they could never get near the bottom of the cup.
Fortunately, since I spend about a billion dollars a year in gas at the
local Citgo he was quite willing to spin 'em down for me.  Got my camber
reset this AM, and ordered the rears (its amazing what you notice when your
front end starts working).  Jason assures me that the only problem I'll have
with them is that the lower bolts are often "quite snug."
