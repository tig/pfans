Hi all, 

I just got my 951 about 2 months ago and am loving it. I just went
to my first Drivers Ed/Track event at Summit Point last weekend and
had a blast (another addiction sigh..). While I was there I noticed
a lot of the street cars had a removable harness setup. After thinking
about it, I concluded that it made a lot of sense. Both from a 
performance and a safety perspective. So I ordered a removable
harness bar from Automotion. Now I need the harness and have a few
questions (well maybe a lot...)

My car is used for primarily pleasure travel so I don't want a 
permanent setup. Does anybody out there currently have setup like 
this? How are the various belts attached?  I would imagine the
shoulder belts are wrap around type. How about the lap belt? Are
they attached to the same point as the standard seatbelts? Is the bolt
replaced with an eyebolt and then a "snap-in" lap belt is used.? Where
does the anti-submarine belt anchor get attached? Any opinions about
manufacturers? Camlock or latch? (I've pretty much decided on camlock,
but I'll listen to arguments) Any opinion on vendors?

Thanks in advance.
