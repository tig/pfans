For about 2.5 yrs I owned a 944S (sold it last may)and also had plenty of
opportunities to autocross it.  As Jeff says, the car is not slow, it is
simply a matter of perception.  At 4200rpm and beyond(all the way up to
6800), the car screams which makes for a great contrast with what one
feels in the 1.5 to 3krpm range.  The reponse of the engine below 4krpm is
quite different, hence one feels the car is slow. 

It is not.  I may get flamed for this, but I still feel that it is much 
easier to go fast in an S than in a T.  I have test driven two different
944Turbos and both times I felt that the S was much quicker (to a point),
more enjoyable and easier to drive around town and on the highway below
100mph.

One really needs to learn how to drive the T so that he/she is not caught
with no boost or the engine will feel dead for a looooong time (until the
turbo finally comes up to speed).  While the T is building up boost, the S
will be gone! Remember that the compression on the S is 10.9:1 as compared
to 8.0:1.  While the T is running as a NA engine, ie off-boost it is a
much slower car than the S.  I feel that my findings were substantiated at
the autocross tracks and on long Missouri winding roads.  The S is much
gutsier in the low end.

To be fair, once the T has a chance to come on boost, it will pass the S
with no problem.  You need to have room so that the T will have time to
build up boost, but it will pass the S.
