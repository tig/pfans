With regard to the message sent by Anders Svensson, I would just like to
make the following comments.

I think the point that the guy with the red porsche was trying to make
was not that speeding was ok, but that the police were unfairly
inforcing the law. It seems there was a bias toward ticketing red
porsches, but the 'locals' were left alone.

People become offended because the apparent intent of the enforcement
seems incorrect.

The government imposes speed limits to protect people because some in
some areas it may be unsafe (for others) if you travel above a certain
speed (in an average car - not something like a porsche).
For this reason, most people welcome things like phantom warning traps
(ones that look like speed traps but are there not to ticket people but
rather to slow the traffic in that area - especially those with radar
detectors etc) because the intent is correct - to protect the general
public.
What we do have a problem with is when the ticketing becomes either a
profit making enterprise, or a method of taking out the frustrations of
the poor officer who is required to sit all day and man one of these
speed traps. 

Also, you(Anders) said: 
"Why on all earth is it OK to speed (a little), but not OK to rob (just
a
little), rape (just a little) or murder (only a little)? "

I can tell you exactly.
The other "crimes" directly involve other people.
Theft would not be such unless someone was being stolen from.
Murder would not be such unless someone was killed.
And likewise for rape.

For this reason, the other crimes are morally and socially unacceptable,
and therefore making them common law and enforcing it is acceptable to
everyone.
Speed limits on the other hand are taken by most to be a limit on the
freedom and rights of the individual.

When I speed I do so only if I consider it safe to do so.
If I wipe myself out because I was going to fast on an empty road and I
couldn't handle my car then it's my fault and I only endangered myself.

Original message:
-Hi folks, I'm back,!   
-
-Saw on the list the other day that some individual complained about
-being caught by the police in his red Porsche.
-
-While I certainly is sympathetic about that individuals plight, I'll
-like to add my 2 c on this issue (wich is very close to my heart, now
-when I also am a Honoray Police Detective in Cambridge, Ohio -  thanks
-to Rick..)
-
-There are som really really strange things when comparing speeding to
-other crimes.
-
-Before anybody screams in agony "if speeding is a crime - whats murder,
-then", let us just calmly accept that a crime is a recognized deviation
-from rules of the society as they are described in the lawbook. There
-are minor crimes and more serious crimes, but the principle is clear,
if
-it's against the law - it may be a crime. The punishment usually
relates
-to the crime.           
-
-Most (if not all) drivers accept that not following the traffic rules
is
-dangerous enough to warrant a punishment (a ticket), in some cases loss
-of the right to drive on public roads and in the extreme cases, also
-loss of freedom.
-
-You probably understand that I am rather sympathetic to traffic rules,
-by now...
-
-Now to my observation:
-
-It seems that the police never (well, almost never) make any mistakes
-when catching speeders. Speeders very seldom, if ever, deny the fact
-that the were speeding - at the most they argue the measured speed. 
-Nobody is ever ashamed of being speeding either, it is clearly outside
-of most societys informal and formal rules, that governs most of
-ordinary peoples law abidance (sp?).         
-
-So, never we hear "I didn't do it" - instead we hear "Ok, I did it, but
-I think it shouldn't really count" or "OK, but it was only a little" or
-"OK, I did it, but surely there has to be more important things for you
-to do". 
-
-Why on all earth is it OK to speed (a little), but not OK to rob (just
a
-little), rape (just a little) or murder (only a little)? 
-
-And just think about the reactions when, accused for some other crime
-than speeding, you defend your self with: 
-"Ah, there was nobody around, so I didn't think it would hurt" 
-or: 
-"I have a much better judgment (read: car) than most people, so I can
-break some laws without doing any harm" 
-or, best of all:
-"Why me, when lots of others go free"
-
-If this is going too esotheric for some of you, don't mind. 
-
-I just want to point out that speeding, and getting caught is not an
-really an error of the police who nails you. He (or she) is just doing
-his/her job, no more (but no less, either).     
-
-Anyone speeding, should really ask himself just the simple question: 
-
-Will I, a grown-up, with full control of my right foot, be able to take
-the responsibility for my actions today, even if that means getting
-caught by some zealous police officer, maybe with an ulcer and a an
urge
-to at least get somebody on this lousy shift - and in that case, am I
to
-accept the potential, but unlikely outcome of my descision to drive to
-my hearts desire?        
-
-Depending on that answer, drive accordingly! 
-
-When caught, please don't come whining about police harassment and ask
-for sympathy. Be a Man (or Woman), pay up and act happy. 
-
-Face it, Porsche fellows and habitual speeders, the guy that didn't see
-'them' first may not really done that good of a job looking out,
-anyway...
-
-Yours, not completely seriously, but mostly truly:
-
-Anders Svensson, ex sailor and now recommissioning the the red police
-magnet... and if they get me - I sure won't tell...
