Yeap bur the house kill the patient and let the robbers go, spped limit
is 35 mph... Talk about stone age.. 
My 0.10 on all that. 

Is easier to inforce draconniennes speed limits, make money in speeding
tickets and traffic violation, then to teach how to properly drive your
car.. Let's recognize guys, driver's ed is a joke.. half of the drivers
_ exceot my buddies on this list ( has to protect your back on this one
:)) ) would get their licenses on countries like Germany or Switzerland
and even in France. It's a real joke to get a Dl in GA. and I was told
that is not very different from other states. Who makes money in all
that ??
Insurance companies, govts., car companies and etc... \
We pay a fortune for Insurance, local/state/federal make a bundle on
those tickets, and car makers don't have to spend money to make the cars
safer and more fuel efficient. The "grunnen" excuse in BRD is also a
pain in the butt 'cause EU was late changing cars and gas to lead free
and cats.. The poor Schwartze Wald, or Black Forest in BRD was in really
bad shape that's why they started this campaing ( i know I screw up this
word) to stop the "no holds barred speed on the Autobahn ". They had a
point at the time.. Anyway we can just sit down now and see how screwd
up we let this whole mess go and do nothing or just be a little more
conscient and write, call, scream to whomever is on charge...
Ouf BW went to hell this time 
Take cara all
