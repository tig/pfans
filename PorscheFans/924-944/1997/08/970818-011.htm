I have a 924 auto (European model w/125 hp), and I am very pleased with it.
I have had it for a year without any problems, and the transmission seems
rock solid. There are ofcourse those that think automatics are shit,
especially in Norway where automatics are rare, but I like it. Many frown at
automatic Porsches, but if you don't care what others say it is a great car
no matter which kind of transmission it has. I'm only 19 and I don't drink
coffee, but I love being able to eat breakfast while driving. That always
makes me feel like I have made the right choice. :)

Remember, whichever version you buy, make sure to get it thorougly checked.
If you buy a manual, check the clutch and gearbox. The clutch and synchros
on 944s all fail. I haven't heard anything about automatic faults, but if
you find out anything, could you please notify me? It's nice to know what I
can expect.
