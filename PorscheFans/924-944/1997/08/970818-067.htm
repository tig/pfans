Marshall, per your questions about there being a "stigma" attached to
buying a 944 with an automatic:  I don't mean to sound elitist but I think
the vast majority on this list would say yes.  In my opinion, the primary
reason for buying any Porsche is the fun to be had behind the wheel (then
again, this is not true for the gold chain crowd).  This fun will
unquestionably be diminished with an automatic.  The tiptronic is certainly
better than a garden variety automatic in that some driver input is
possible, but even that is a compromise forced on Porsche who must bow to
market pressures to some degree if they want to sell in large urban
markets.  I'm sure a few on this list buy the Porsche line that this was a
direct descendent of the racing PDK transmissions, etc.  Sure, that's why
automatics still suck up more power and are generally slower in
acceleration; just what you want in a race car.  I'm sure this is
especially acute in an older 944 (N/A) where there is not a tremendous
amount of power to spare.  If it's a comfortable highway cruiser that you
can drink coffee in you seek, there are certainly better choices out there.
