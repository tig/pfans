I just bought my first Porsche 3 weeks ago, a very sweet 944, 1983, 76K
Black, very nice condition, one owner. A Sweet44.

Here's the problem, I'm a blonde driving a German Car. That can only
mean one thing...

The dilema... After driving a short period of time and turning the
engine off, you know to just run in and grab something real quick, it
won't start.  I'm pretty certain its fuel/temperature related because
amibient temperature doesn't seem to make a difference.  It starts up
perfectly in the morning and at the end of the day, obviously when the
engine is cold. I'm wondering why this happens with a fuel injected
system.  Is the fuel running too lean?  Is it vaporizing from the heat
of the bock and causing a blockage. I don't know, however, when it won't
start and I try to turn the engine over, I also notice there is no
movement in the tacometer, causing me to worry about the Speed or
Reference Sensors which can be temperature related I understand.  I have
replaced the DME/Fuel Pump relay, just in case.  Nada.

Help, I need this fixed soon, summer ends very quickly here in Aspen and
the snow flies too soon and 'baby' goes away til spring.  But I'm not
about to go into the shop not knowing what's up.  Any suggestions you
can make would be helpful... Thanks.

I'm a blonde.  You understand.

Sweet44
