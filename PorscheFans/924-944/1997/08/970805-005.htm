Hi all,

I have the opportunity to purchase a intercooler that has come of a 951 ( or
so I am told ). I am also told that with some effort it can be made to fit
my 931, by dropping the rad I should be able to fit it in the vented nose.
The stock air filter box on my car has been replaced with a JR cone filter
so I have a little more to play with.

I was wondering if anyone has attempted this before, or has any comments?
Looking at where the intercooler will go and where the turbo is located
there will need to be quite a lot of pipe work, is there a problem with
this? where on a 951 is the intercooler mounted?

Basically is it worth doing or is there a better solution.

Best regards

Richard.

931    Finished engine and turbo rebuild, started first time after the rebuild
       last Saturday (first attempt) just got to find the bolts for the bonnet
       now. Then its of to Germany next week!
