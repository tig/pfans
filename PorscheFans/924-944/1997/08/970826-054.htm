Hi P-fans!

A while back, there was a thread on a hard starting situation. The car took
two tries to start, etc.....

Well, just the other day I experienced this problem myself. I looked around
for any obvious mechanical problems. What I found was a fuel leak near the
back of the car. It didn't make sense immediately, but I thought there
might be a connection.

All the fuel lines were fine, but the filter itself was leaking at a seam.
I suppose that after the pressure of the line was released, the hole would
allow air into the fuel line. I don't know how old this filter was, but it
didn't seem to be blocked, judging by the performance of the car once it
started.

Replacing the filter fixed the leak and now the car starts right away, just
like it used to.

Hope this helps someone else out there.
