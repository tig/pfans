>==================================
According to Peter Morgan of England, who is at this time getting ready to
publish a book on the water-cooled Porsches, the following information was
supplied to him by the factory:
	[Total run of 1988 944 Turbo S:	1635 (USA 718; ROW 917)
There were no specific chassis numbers for the 250hp Turbo S.  They were
part of the 1988 production run as follows:
	USA:	95JN150001 to 95JN151874
	ROW:	95JN104001 to 95JN101875
However, they are distinguishable by their engine numbers.  The 250hp
engine is M44/52, with serial numbers 47J00001 to 1830 (that is, there were
1830 250hp engines made during the '88 model year).  The standard 220hp
engines were M44/51 with serial numbers starting with 45J00001.]

Peter faxed this info to me from England back in February, just after we
made arrangements for his photographer to shoot my car as the example of
the original limited edition Turbo S for his book (which is supposed to be
out around the end of the year).

Hope this helps some more.
