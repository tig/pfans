>Hi everyone!  I'm a nubie with lots of questions regarding my  "P Machine"
>- (1984 944).   I purchased it in reasonably good shape  and relatively
>low miles.  It currently has 92 K on the odometer, 22k of which are mine.
>Recently, a few problems developed which I think may somehow be related.
>When I purchased the car, it had a leaky power steering resevoir which did
>a good job of soiling the right front engine compartment and, I think,
>eating up the right front sway bar bushing which I replaced.  One day
>while driving, the radiator developed a kinda big bubbling leak which of
>course, was one very hot midwest day and the temp guage went waaaaaaay
>over to the right (o.k., it was more like 3/4).  After filling it back up
>with a 50/50 mix I proceeded to head for home while I noticed the temp
>guage still went up at idle but came back closer to normal when driving.
>Then all of a sudden , I noticed the "oil" light came on, along with the
>"brake fluid"  AND "brake pad sensor" lights!!  PANIC!  I  looked
>immediatly to my oil pressure guage which seemed to be reading fine - at
>3.5-4.0 bar.  I checked the oil which I'd changed just 2000 miles prior
>and the level was fine.  The glove box handbook was of no help so I
>proceeded home, sweating bullets and checking guages the entire way!  What
>I noticed was - the warning lights would all go out for a couple seconds
>when the revs reached 3000  rpm but then returned.  Also when I did make
>it home without explosion,lockup, or meltdown, as I parked I noticed the
>lights would also go out as I turned the steering wheel with the car
>stationary and when the steering wheel was turned to either extreme.  Only
>to come back on of course.  A few days later, still waiting for the
>radiator to come in, I cheated and filled it up with coolant and went for
>a ride to see if things had changed.  Surprise!! - when I first started
>it, the light were on but then they went out when I turned the wheel and
>stayed out.  I pulled off and drove about 2 miles before they came on once
>again.
>     Questions :
>		1.  Could there be something else wrong with my cooling
>system 				besides the leak/loss of pressure
>that would cause the temp to rise significantly especially at idle,
>eventhough its full of coolant?  I 've run checks on the fans, and their
>sensor switch which seem to be working.  What about the water pump?
>		2.  Whats the deal with the warning lights?  Does the fact
>that they all came on together, with no perceived change in the engine
>mood, point to an electrical short  circuit of some sort? (I'd also
>recently changed the front brake pads and sensors while the rears were
>fine. The brake fluid level is o.k. aso).
>		3. Could this somehow be connected to the power steering
>pump, as evidenced by the change when turning the steering wheel,or could
>it be the  power steering fluid leak which caused an erosion of wire
>insulation, thereby
>resulting in a short circuit which then elicits a change when the steering
>is turned?
>
>
>SORRY for being so long winded!  I didn't want to leave out any important
>bit of info.
>     Up until now, my Haynes workshop manual has been my best
>friend/pillow pal - as I've read it cover to  cover more than once!!  I
>hope some of you can help me with this dilemma!
