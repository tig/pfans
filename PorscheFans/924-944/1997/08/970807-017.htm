Having been through this, 45k miles is an acceptable and safe limit for
belt change intervals.  However, if you need to replace the water pump,
replace the belts regardless of the mileage.. it is not expensive, will
require no more laber, and brings piece of mind. Be sure to check the
various tensioner and idler rollers for nastiness when you spin them.. 
replace as needed.  Use factory belts. They cost no more than aftermarket,
and are guaranteed by PCNA if you are in the US.

I would be wary of non-factory rebuilds.  I just spent a fortune on labor
to replace a rebuilt pump from Tweeks that only lasted 15,000 miles.  The
pump was guaranteed, but labor was not covered.  Factory rebuilt pumps
should be ok, and don't cost much more than aftermarket.  The aftermarket
pumps all claim to have 'improved and larger roller bearings for long
life.' I would buy a new factory pump.. the extra expense pales in
comparison to the labor (hired out or your own) to change a prematurely 
failed one.. please learn from my mistake.

 -Gregor  89 944 2.7.  New water pump, whiney belts and rollers.
