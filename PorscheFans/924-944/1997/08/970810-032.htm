hi all,
i just finished swapping out my transaxle on my 78 924 (if anyone would like
a large paperweight half filled with sand ,formally called a 016 4speed,
email me!) anyway i'm finishing up and decide my rear left hub assembly seems
a little tight (bearing??)  so this being my first porsche i go back to the
hardware store and buy more tools, and the appropriate socket to fit the
dreaded castellated nut. ofcoarse the local vw dealer doesnt sell the "real "
tool, and the porsche dealer isnt conveinient, so i attach my breaker bar and
dig out the ole' hammer.  this was two days ago, and the nut hasn't moved a
millimeter.  haynes says basically to beat it until it comes off, if  anyone
has any secret techniques you'd like to share i'd appreciate it.
also, for 924 addicts in the long island area, im about finished stripping my
"donor" 924, email me if you need anything (realll cheap, like come and pick
it up and leave a six pack on the stoop cheap) anything i cant use is going
bye-bye real soon , so email quick..
thanks in advance , eric (ericj001@aol.com)
