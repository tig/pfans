Im sorry you have a "Reflector" that doesnt look the best.  I have one
that is lights up and says "PORSCHE" and looks very good,very OEM .  In
fact I thought it was OEM untill People told me it was an aftermarket
thing.  In fact I think it would look worse without it.  Maybe you can
find one that works better for you. Good luck.
