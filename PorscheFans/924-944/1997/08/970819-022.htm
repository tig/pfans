	I have a Euro spec 951. It has the H4s. They are ok.The sealed beams on
US cars must be terrible. I have found that the car is less stable above
140 with the lights on. This is ok though because I find that you will
out drive the H4s above 100MPH on a dark road anyway. I spoke with my
mechanic on Friday about some brighter lights. He said swapping the
driving light bulbs for 100 watt items should be ok and not require
rewiring. He recommended against changing the main beams because of the
need to rewire. My car is right hand drive and the battery is in the
trunk too. He ( and the service manager) was very excited about my
suggestion to upgrade the suspension and fit some R spec tires too.

Seeing the recent thread about the Hella H4 headlights, I have a
question
or three.  It is my understanding the lighting from the H4 conversion is
vastly better than the original sealed beam (US) headlights.  This
improvement comes even with the standard, legal 55/65 watt lamps.  Does
this have to do with the projected light pattern?

If this is the case, I would like to convert.  If folks could reply to
me
privately where they obtained theirs and the price paid, I would be
grateful.
