On the note of my turbo removal...

I have ordered APE's chips for the 2.8l with K-27.  Before I had the '89 944
turbo chips.  Hopefully this will help improve drivability.

I sent the turbo to Turbo Engineering Corporation in Golden, Colorado.  So far
they have been great to work with.  I should be getting my turbo back sometime
this week.  I would recommend TEC for other turbo rebuilds.  The cost is $180
for labor and $130 in parts for a standard rebuild which include balancing the
turbo.

One thing to note, TEC also does a lot of rebuild for other companies and
provide turbos to other companies.  Performance buys turbos from them, and a
number of racing teams are supplied buy them (if I remember, Stillen was one of
them).  I don't have the # with me, but I'll provide that later.

I finally broke down and bought the turbo supplement for the 944.  I have both
microfiches, and finally gave up on looking at crappy pictures.  I ended up
paying ~$50 to My Porsche for the supplement.  I would recommend buying the
supplement if you don't have it.  (even if you have the micro-fiche).

Everything seems to be going slower without UPS, especially my UPS shipments.
 This has put a damper on some of the orders.  For instance, the APE chips were
sent 2 1/2 weeks ago, right before UPS went on strike.  I still await the
chips.  (and some other items).

I've spent the past weeks cleaning the engine, and fixing some other misc.
stuff.  As soon as I get the turbo back, I'll start rebuilding.
