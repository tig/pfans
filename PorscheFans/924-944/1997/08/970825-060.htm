on the way home this afternoon i BROKE the car.  i think the rear diff. is gone.  
the hubs will turn however when i turn one the other is no longer moving.  ( it 
was doing the whole turn one forward the other turned rear, then it decided to 
stop doing so.)  what was really ashame is i was in the middle of a pretty hard 
turn and it went (crrejfgrskjfhdskjhshf) short for clunk, i think.  of course 
there was an au=dience for this so it hurts double.  

what is the easiest way to do the repair work quickly and what tools will i 
need? i must go to school on wed. and work the rest of the week.

i am sure now that it is the LSD variety but of course it no worky!!

need the replies quick and let the come a plenty, might need step by step if 
anyone can help or if anyone with exp. is in the Waco area.  if i dont fix this 
soon i might be forced to sell and i DONT want to do that.

TIA

matt
