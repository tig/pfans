Dear sir:

	This sounds similar to a problem I had and wrote about. but I do not
know if it it the same.  My problem occured when I floored the car. 
After 3 seconds or so, the engine power output would drop off
drastically, returning when I let my foot off the gas. I noted that
boost pressure was never shoing above 1.6 bar on the dash gauge, and at
rest, with the car shut down but the key in the run position, the boost
gauge was reading several points under the 1 bar mark which is where it
resides now.  
	Check the contact on the air meter box for corrosion and check the
vaccuum lines around the breather.  Floor the car, see if there is
hesitation, and see what your boost gauge reads.
	Of course, it might be something entirely different, like the fuel
pump, computer, distributor, wires... ):

PS:  If you find you need new computers, I have a spare set purchased in
attempting to fix this problem.  (:

        Yesterday I had the engine on my 89 951 'die' for about 5
seconds while
I was driving down the motorway. I was travelling on level ground at
about 75, it was not raining. The engine restored itself and there have
been  no further instances so far. I am assuming that this is
electrical. I was not low on gas.  I recall a few weeks ago someone had
a similar problem.  If you are still out there what was the fix. I just
hope I am not entering a new and infinitely more expensive phase of
Porsche ownership.

Richard.
