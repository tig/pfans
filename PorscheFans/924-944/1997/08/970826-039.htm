	Juha, first and most important, the timing belt is
	is every 30K miles not 60K. You say you've got the
	records; take a look at them. If it hasn't had a clutch
	job yet at 90K, it's probably gonna need one soon.
	Ditto for the water pump but I'm willing to bet
	this car's probably on it's second one already.
	Don't be surprised if you have to do oil cooler
	seals at this point, too, unless they've recently been
	been done. Check the records and see how many of the
	seals have been replaced. Oil seals, I mean, especially
	the cam and crank seals at the front the of the engine.
	If you have the original seals still in there, they're 
	probably already leaking and will need to be replaced
	pronto as they could leak all over the timing and cam belts.
	Check the seals on the transaxle as they may be leaking by now.
	The engine shouldn't need to be rebuilt for a long time unless
	it's been abused. Rotors and pads depend on who drove the
	car. They could be in good shape or bad. I got 50K out my
	last set of pads though. Good luck!
