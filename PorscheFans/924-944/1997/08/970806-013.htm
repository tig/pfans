====================================================
>As you recall, I had a puff of white smoke in the morning.  1987 944S
>
>Added ZUNZ powder to coolant, all was OK that night.  Car ran *great*.
>
>Next morning, rappa rappa rappa.  Sounds like a lifter.  Bzzz bzzz bzzz
>sounds like a chain.  Shop says the lifters are ticking because of thin
>oil, and timing chain is rubbing on the inside of the cover.  ??? 
>Wants to replace tensioner (which is new).  I refuse that.  They
>replace oil, no fix.
>
>They offer to check oil pressure valve for failure, causing too-high
>oil pressure which would make lifter noise and push hydraulic tensioner
>too high, causing chain noise.  They loosen this, check that, yada
>yada.  Fire up the car and it loses ALL oil pressure.  They check for
>failed oil pressure valve and overfill car with oil to test for broken
>pick-up tube.  No go.
>
>Shop says because of no oil pressure they need to pull the pan or
>engine to check the oil pump, and do a complete rebuild if necessary. 
>50 hrs. labor minimum.  Many many parts.  Mucho grande buckaroos.
>
>What happened to make my car lose all oil pressure when it was on the
>lift?  It has always pegged at 5 bar.  Never a problem.  Isn't there
>anything simple they have done during the testing procedure, or
>something overlooked?  I just can't believe I have to rebuild my engine
>when it was running perfectly up until now.
