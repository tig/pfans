Hi everyone,

Last night I attended the local regions meeting of Porsche Club GB , we had a 
guy from the local Porsche dealers along to give a 'technical talk' . He is now 
the work shop manager , but has over 16 years of working on 911,924 etc I 
thought some of you might like to hear a few of the points that were covered.

1. Cam belts.
These only need replacing every 48K mile or 4 years. The balance belts only 
need replacing ever other cam belt change or 4 years.
HOWEVER all the belts ,pully and rolers etc  should be checked every 12K 
miles/every year. Also the belt should be tensioned after 1-2K miles from 
replacement.

2. 944 Turbos
Very reliable if maintained correctly, but they eat brakes and tyres (no 
suprise there!) 

3. 911 (964) are the most expensive to keep on the road, 993 is much cheaper to 
run and is very reliable. There was a fair bit more on 911 , especially SC and 
3.2 Carrera , but I didn't take too much notice.

4. Reboring
The 924/944/928 (and I assume 968) can be rebored , but you need a specialist 
that knows what to do. The aluminum engine has a very high amount of silcone (I 
think thats what he said) and is very soft. He said that the only normal reason 
to have to rebore was a broke ring or similar as they 'last forever' otherwise.
There are 2 companies in the UK that can do it.

5. Boxter, no real common problems , but a few minor bits and pieces .
Everyone that has one loves them . 

6. 924S 
He seemed to have a soft spot for this car and rated it very highly .

7. Clutches
I mentioned the clutch judder when hot . He said its quite common and the way 
to fix it - get a new clutch! One of guys with a 944 Cab has the problem too 
and he suggests using 2nd gear to pull away (only when you are having the 
judder though) , helps make things a bit smoother of the line.

Hope you find this interesting.

Cheers
Richard
