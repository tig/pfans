Hi and thanks for the reply,

Ok well I suppose I asked for that one. To explain a little I ran the car
for about
500 miles in the UK not taking it above 2.5K, The trip over to Germany was
about 800 miles, I did close on that while in Germany. Slowly building up
the rpm
to a max of just over 3K. And only once did I take it to over 4K on the way
back.
Just how long is a run in period? I was always told (And the advice from the
garage)
was to start of slow and gradually build up the rpm over 1K to 1.5K miles,
making
sure you don't stress the engine. Am I wrong? The other thing is that the boost
on the turbo has been turned down for the run-in.

After over 2000 miles with the car performing well I did run it back at some
speed
80-100 mph this is when the rather noisy exhaust started to get to me. and Just
before leaving Germany I did take it to the 135mph mark. Hence I know when the 
noise stopped.

The 931 should be able to cruise at 100mph (approx 3.3K rpm on my dial) this
is not 
excessive on the Germany autobarns. There are plenty of other people doing
far more.
This does not mean I agree with it all the time, but what I did was legal
and safe on
the streches of road I was on, given the conditions at the time.


>Question: have you got an aluminum or cast iron block?

The car in question has a Iron Block with a aluminium head. The rebuild
included the
following. 

        Crank Grind and polish , new OS/pistons etc,
        head reconditioned and fitted high lift cam.
        new clutch, new K26 Turbo (PO destroyed it when engine blew). 

Next stage is to fit the intercooler, restore the boost. Probably do some
work on
the fuel system. I also would like to improve the breaks, any ideas?

If all goes well I intend to enter it in the Brighton Speed trials next year.

Best regards
   Richard.
