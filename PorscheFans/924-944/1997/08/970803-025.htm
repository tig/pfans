Correspondance in the DeLorean mailing list prompts me to write this request,
but  Let me start at the beginning.  I have had State Farm insurance for 30
years, including corvettes, two Maseratis for the last 17 years, house,
umbrella policy and earthquake insurance.  No claims!  (Ten years ago the
company revised insurance for special vehicles and converted the Maseratis
form $50 deductible to $1000 +10% deductible)

Five years ago State Farm told me that they would insure the Delorean that I
was about to purchase.  The agent called me a couple of hours before I was to
buy the car and said that the company refused to insure it.  I found
insurance with Farmers and purchased the car following week.

Before purchasing the Porsche 944 Turbo, I called to inquire about insurance
and was told that I could have standard insurance as on my Mercury Sable.
 Thursday I received a letter that State Farm will only insure for $1000
deductible comprehensive and collision.  Friday when I told my agent that
that was why I called before purchasing the car, said that she was sorry (for
not doing her job again!)

Now to the point.  A DeLorean owner in Florida added the car to his State
Farm insurance and was later told by the agent that the company will only
insure the car for six months unless the owner can show that State Farm
insurs other DeLoreans.  Strange?  Anyway, he requested help from other
owners on the mailing list and several have responded with State Farm policy
numbers and agent names/phone numbers.

I am also going to use that information, to confront my agent.  Does anyone
have State Farm Insurance with normal comp/collision?  I need to determine
whether to change insurance companies or just agents.

PS.  I won't start time trials until after driving school in September, but I
went to PCA time trials at Streets of Willow Springs, CA today to ask more
questions and watch.  I spent 20 minutes on the track as a passenger in an
'88 951 driven by an expert driver.  What a car!  I never imagined that the
car could handle that well, even after everything that I have read.

TIA, Claus Groth, '86 951
