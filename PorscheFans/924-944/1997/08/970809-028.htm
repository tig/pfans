Hello, I attempted to post to this board awhile ago, and never saw it in the
list. I hope this works this time! The last post I attempted was the story of
my 1987 944s. I purchased this car from my neighbor with 112,000 miles on it
for $1000. Yes, $1000. I knew that it need a new clutch, major tune up, belts
etc. WSell after the work was done twice, the first shop just lost a $4000
law suit. ( Great news for me, this means new suspension is on the way) The
car is everything I could possibly want! I previosly owne a 1995 Honda accord
ex 5 sp that I had completely rebuilt into a street /strip 350hp rocket. And
I never had the fun or excitement that my P car gives me. 
I do have a few questions. 1. Do all 944s have a slight lag until about 4200
rpm. My car seems to not have very good acceleration below that point. 2. The
a/c worked fine until last month. Now all it blows is hot air, no matter what
the a/c is set to. When I first get into the car in the morning, it blows
cool. But as soon as the engine temp gets  to where it should be, the a/c
blows hot. I am fairly knowledgable, is it possibly something as simple as
the temp. sensor, or am I looking at a new condensor. 3. I can only work the
sunroof from the relays in the hatch. The switch is not working, it blows
fuses everytime I put a new one in. 4. Are their any suggestion for
manufacturers of chips. I know there are alot out their, some work, some
dont. Who has found a good one?
Thank you in advance for the consideration. I live by this board and have
fixed many minor problems by the ionformation found here. You guys are the
greatest!!
