Hi Steve:

If you or any other PorscheFan are interested in information, literature
(promotinal brochures, posters, models, etc.), or interior fabric for
the Turbo S, Ken Kusik in Nebraska (402-420-1523) has an extensive
collection.  He also has a wealth of knowledge concerning these cars. 
Ken is also trying to establish a 944 Turbo S REGISTRY, and is very
eager to hear from Turbo S owners (he is an original owner of one of the
Silver Rose "beauts").  Unfortunately, he doesn't have internet access. 
So if you want to get in touch with him, call him at the number listed
above.  As a side note, he has written a number of articles on various
944 topics for Panorama and PML.  I discovered Ken when I responded to
his ad in the most recent issue of Panorama.

     The "PORSCHE" script above the rear bumper (and below the tail lights) 
     is also a pain to wax around too, because of all the decal edges.  Who 
     needs nail files when you can just use the crease between the paint 
     and decal edges to smooth your fingernails down while getting rid of 
     the excess wax?
     
     Ben

Is this like the "16 Ventiler" script on the S and S2 cars?  It too was a 
dealer installed option.  I have never seen the Turbo script, but I always 
thought that the "16 Ventiler" script tastefully distinguished the car 
from the other 944 variants.  IMHO.
     
BTW, the "16 Ventiler" script is a bit of a pain when one is waxing the 
car.
