Unfortunately, Mike, I don't know the part number, but either someone else
on the list will, or you can probably get it thru a dealer.  If someone can
just come up with the proper size designation and possibly the tensile
strength, it probably can be found thru alternative sources.  Or, maybe the
threaded receptacle can somehow be removed so that a "thru-bolt" can be
installed with locking nuts on both sides of the facia.  I'm not real sure
just how it is attached to a frame member, but I'll bet some of the racers
on this list will know.

PS - Is anyone from this list going to attend our Club Race at Road America
this coming Labor Day Weekend?  If so, please try to find me, or let me
know what your car number and class are, and I will look for you.  I will
probably be spending most of my time up in the Media Center in Timing &
Scoring, but will roam throughout the paddock area in my spare time (look
for a white Chev S-10 Blazer with Paragon Products signage on sides and
rear (Thanks, Jason).
