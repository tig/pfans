Hi Folks,

Novice mechanic incrementally doing 60k service.
I've done simple stuff on the car; oil, plugs,
rear shocks, coolant flush, brake pads, gear oil etc.
It's time to re-pack the front wheel bearings.  I
took a peek under the hub caps, and the retaining
nut and washer were covered with a white lubricant
(lithium?).  The Haynes manual doesn't mention coating
these parts as part of the procedure.  What's the deal
here?

thanks in advance

     And cars don't mind running around without a bra on either!  (I hope I 
     didn't offend anyone--I'm sorry if I did, I was only kidding please)

Your car will not leave if even if you do not ride in another.  I sold my 
944S thinking it was the correct choice and now that I want to find 
another 944 variant, I am having a hard time finding a decent one in town.
     
Still, a car is probably easier to live w/o than a SO.
