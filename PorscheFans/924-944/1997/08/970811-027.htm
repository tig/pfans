Hi again,
	Thanks for the responses on ABS.  Don't have it.

1) Took apart my computers (good thing as one of the chips was 
barely socketed).  I find that I have Autothority 86/87 Stage 
II chips in my 88.  Autothority says that I can upgrade to the 
88 (different set) for $100.  Anybody have any input on this?  
I'm thinking about doing this but my suspicion is that I 
probably won't see any difference.

2) Electric seat controls.  I have a problem with my passenger 
seat where I can't get the back to tilt forward/back.  I can 
hear the motor when I press the "tilt up" side but nothing on 
the "tilt down".  Taking off the seat side cover, I can see a 
shaft inside the seat turning but the drive isn't getting to 
the seat frame.  It APPEARS that there should be some sort of 
concentric hexagonal shaped shaft which mounts inside the seat 
shaft AND extends to fit inside the metal side plate.  Can 
anyone confirm that this is the case?  And if so, is this 
replaceable.  Seems like it should be but I can't tell without 
taking more stuff apart.  I seem to have this problem on both 
sides of the seat so some idjit must have removed them.  Don't 
ask ME why.

3) Cam/Balancer belts/idler/tensioners
I'm about to have my first full service on my 88 951.  When I 
bought the car (2 months ago), the belts were checked out.  
They were the right tension and looked new, PO said they were 
new but I'm going to replace them anyway.  I'll have more 
confidence and I'll know exactly how many miles they have on 
them.  After all the recent discussions about whining, I think 
I'll use the Porsche belts.  My ?? is, what do I do about the 
idler/tensioners?  Do I rely on the shop (they are Porsche only 
but I don't know them that well), do I replace everything (how 
much is everything?) or are there some insightful ??s I can ask 
the shop before they do the work?

4) Front license plate effect on cooling system
I live in a state which requires a front plate (CA).  I don't 
have one on the car now but may need to consider it (if I get a 
ticket).  But it looks like a plate would cover up half of the 
two slots that are in front of the radiator.  Anybody know if 
this will affect the cooling or make the car run hotter?  What 
a great excuse.  "I'm sorry officer, but a front license plate 
would increase wind resistance and make my car run hotter :-)"

Note:  Isn't it ironic that the backordered 944 workshop 
manuals finally show up and then UPS goes on strike.  (Fedex is 
$21 to ship about 60 miles but I'll probably get them 
tomorrow!)
