Porschefans:
	Since there is talk about boost controller, I have a HKS electronic
boost controller extra.  It is the second generation controller.  It
have three (3) presets (adjusted by owner) for boost level, low, mid,
high buttons.  Each bottom can be set to any level you wish, for example
low=o.6 bar mid=0.9 high=1.3 The controller monitors boost for your car,
and electronic control the wastegate.  Please inquire HKS for all the
technical data, this unit does not have fuzzy logic as their 97-98 model
do, but it does what it is suppose to do, boost control.  I am not sure
the exactly how it would connect to a factory engine management, but I
know it has been done, from an old issue of Excellence.  My 951 did not
use the stock Motronic and KLR nor cycling valve, so I cannot comment on
the installation.  Please do your research into the hookups, I will sell
the unit w/ instructions for $400.  Note the unit controller section
have 3 vaccum/boost connection, 1) connect to manifold- tell computer
vaccum/boost data
2) connect to bottom of wastegate port
3) connect to top of wastegate port (951 wastegate need to be modified)

Again, sorry, I cannot be more help with stock units.  This would be a
good project for you enthusiast out their

The 951 race car just finish installation of rollcage (race-tec from OG
racing) with added NASA door bars and front piller bar.

Thanks,
