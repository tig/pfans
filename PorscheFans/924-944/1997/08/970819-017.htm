Take it from the man who owns (and is selling at a big loss) one.  To 
run in the top 3 of PCA Racing Class F, which has the distinction of 
being the biggest class in club racing by a margin of 2:1 over class G 
(at least in my accounting of race entries), you have to have a great 
car prepared to the maximum the rules allow.  That means an engine 
making every bit of the stock power rating, brakes that don't quit 
under severe punishment and, most important of all, a fantastic 
handling car.  Unfortunately, to get the 951 handling well enough to 
hang with highly prepared 911 Carrara racecars means serious 
setup/installation time and part/labor purchase dollars.  You can 
either fabricate your own imitations of Kelly Moss/Fabcar Parts, which 
will cost you more unless you own your own machine shop, and you still 
have to buy the shocks, and valve them correctly (this is the most 
difficult part, actually).  As a bonus, you then get to figure out 
what suspension setup actually works with your tire of choice.  Once 
you have invested the dollars/time and a season or two of getting the 
car to work, you can try to get it running up front!

Its ALWAYS cheaper in the long run to buy a car prepared by someone 
else, as long as it's a QUALITY job and the car isn't worn out.  I've 
built five track/street PCA cars so far, my next purchase will be a 
completed car, and I'll happily pay for a job done right with the 
right stuff.
