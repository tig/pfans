Hi All,

I have never fixed the horn/fog light problem I've had for
several months, but I'm ready to work on it now.  First,
here's the problem:  I installed some 100W bulbs in the
fog lights and then one rainy night, I was switching
the lights off for oncoming motorsists, but they wouldn't
come back on.  The next day I noticed that the horn also
did not work.

I have the factory manuals (finally) and it looks like the
horn and the fog lights ground to the same point (MP IV).
In fact, even though they are on separate diagrams, the 
ground wire for each is labelled as "1.5 BR".  The BR 
stands for brown, so does it seem likely that I burned 
up the ground wire due to the higher output bulbs?  Seems
like the horn and fog lights may share the exact same
ground wire as well.  They are both on separate relays,
so I doubt both relays failed at once, though I guess it
is possible.  Any suggestions, I'd like to fix this
sometime this week.  Also, can anybody give an exact
location for grounding point "MP IV"?

Thanks,
Clark
