Howdy,
	
	Get a quote for fixing that dent. Have your finance ready so you can do
a bit of haggling. The S cars have a lot of extra goodies that if you
added them up would be worth much more than any difference in price to a
non S model. The S cars are very similar to the turbo cup cars, apart
from some of the suspension. Who says racing doesn't improve the breed.
The original turbo S models were produced in 1988. The factory built
1000. ~ 50% were the silver rose cars you hear about. Most of those had
'studio check' burgundy interior. I have seen burg leather in a SR car.
They came with flat disc ( 928 style ) or carrera ( 7 spoke, similar to
design 90 wheels as on 944 S2 and early C2/4s) forged rims. The other
half were spec'd to order. ~700 were imported to USA, 70 to UK and 7 to
NZ. These complemented the 220HP cars that were made in 88 also. 89
model cars ( mid 88 build on) were built to the same spec, although I'm
not sure if the additional front end chassis strengthening was carried
over. But you probably know all that anyway. Acceleration from 100mph is
outstanding and the factory quoted top speed is easily achievable on the
flat ( and hopefully empty road). Get one and go harass 911 drivers.

I have been getting the urge for a 951 real bad lately thanks to reading
the list.  I am a little confused by the differences in various years.

It appears by the HP ratings I see here on the net that there is little
difference year to year including the 88-89 Turbo S versions.  I realize
that as with all 944s ther were many changes at 85-1/2 and a few again
at 87.

I only see one listing for 88-89 turbos and don,t understand.  Are all
88-89's turbo-s models or is the S version a limited production special
those years with the standard also available?  I realize the S has
extras like "tweaked" breaks, suspension etc.
