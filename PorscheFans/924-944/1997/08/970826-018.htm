Brother Bill got a ticket and found the legal system was not rigged for the 
lowly citizen to enter the fray.  The story ends .....

Welcome to the reality of justice in the U.S. of A.  The system of justice was
designed by our revolutionary forefathers, but has for 230 years been operated
and enforced by the legal profession without much oversight from the general
public.  Now, in order to participate in the execution of justice (or what's
left of it) the accused must retain the services of a member of that same legal
profession regardless of his maturity or mental abilities.  You see now that it
is not intellegence or rational thinking that guides the U.S. legal system, 
it's who's lawyer spotted the DA those extra strokes at last Wednesday's golf 
outing that determines the verdict.  IMHO, 90% of the entire system is now
designed for obstruction of justice until you reach for your wallet.

If you think this situation exists only in "Bubba's courtroom" down south, 
guess again.  I have some friends with loose lips (after a few beers) in both
the legal and insurance professions, and I have no doubt that many of the
lawyer jokes going around today are quite justified.  Now, where are all the
insurance industry jokes?  They're the other side of the U.S. justice coin.

Sorry.  This was not really Porsche subject matter, but it will be if you
drive you Porsche in the manner for which it was designed.
