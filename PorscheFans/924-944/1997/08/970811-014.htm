I don't know if y'all have seen this yet (pardon if I am reposting it).  
FWIW.
_______________________
Stuttgart, Germany. (Reuters, Combined Dispatches) --

    In a follow up to the successful launch of the Porsche 986,
    known by the more familiar name of "Boxster", the Board of
    Directors has announced another vehicle line. It is to be known as
    the 999, in honor of the year it will be introduced.

    In their attempt to capture part of the sub-$20,000 market,
    Porsche will be licensing the body-shell of the soon to be
    discontinued Honda Del Sol. As reported in a related article by
    Honda Motor Company of America, the complicated to build Del Sol
    will be discontinued due to flagging sales.

    Porsche has expressed interest in the platform, claiming that it
    has "potential which can only be brought out by moving the
    location of the engine." Speculation has abounded for days about a
    successor to the mediocre 914 series of the early 1970s.

    In a hastily called press conference today, Porsche's Board
    announced their plans to use Honda's platform and out-source the
    drivetrain components which are to be relocated to an "Amidships
    location." According to an unidentified source, "(Porsche) are
    realizing their mistake in selling only to affluent persons who
    wish to be seen in the Carrera. The vehicle will be modified for
    performance and safety before the release in 1999 as a Porsche
    product."

    Sources within the factory hinted at a possibility the
    powertrain would be a mid-mounted water-cooled V6, which would
    come from a plant in Ingolstadt, near Munich. Final assembly will
    be at a new facility being built in Weissach. Analysts compare
    this venture to the VW-Porsche 914 of the early seventies, but are
    cautious to explain the differences, namely wishbone suspension,
    ABS, airbags and an integral roll bar.
