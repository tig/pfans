My doors used to fill up with water. I solved this by scraping the dirt out
of the drain holes (more like slots) at the bottom of the door. Now the door
doesn't fill up, but after heavy rain, tons of water comes pouring out when
I open the door. It doesn't get inside the car though. Is this normal?

(And what is a squeegie?)
