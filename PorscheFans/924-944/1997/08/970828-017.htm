I cant agree more. At the very least you wont piss off the cop anymore.
I turned an ' instant loss of licence ' situation into a 150 KPH
speeding ticket by not talking to the policeman as if he was some sort
of goon. For lower speed offences the " sorry I was listening to the
radio and I must have let my speed creep up officer " excuse works well.
The " I am late for work " excuse seldom does as it shows premeditation
of the 'crime'.
As I'm sure any cop will tell you that even the smartest criminals get
caught. But the stupid one get caught more often.

Richard.

 First thing do not get an attitude (It was your foot on the gas
pedal). Nine times out of ten I pull people over for going over 10-12
over the limit to ask them to slow down I understand your are driving
and well tuned German etc. car. And I will check your drivers info along
with proof of insurance.
