i bought a pioneer 4400 tape deck-cd changer controller.  When i took out the
old blaupunkt cr-5001 there were about 3 wires and one big black one,
assuming that the big black wire was the speaker wires bunched up, we
proceeded to cut it from the back of the stereo, only to discover that none
of the wires matched up.
After closer examination we discovered that there was a Blaupunkt amp
connected to the original deck and the black wire we cut was actually a DIN
wire for the amp, needless to say, after taking it to a local specialty store
they told me that there is no way to integrate to the amp and they have to
remove it and rewire the stereo (this doesnt bother me since im gonna add a
big amp at a later date)  What i want to know is whether or not in 83 there
was an optional amplified stereo available(the car only has 4-4X6's) and if
there is any input on this phenomonon at all.
