Since several folks have had clutch bleeding problems lately, I will attempt 
to describe how I did it. My experience is limited to an '86 NA 944.

First a small note of caution, you MUST disconnect the battery before 
attempting to bleed the clutch. The starter is below the slave cylinder, and 
has a beefy cable running directly to it from the battery. I skipped this 
step, and had a nice fireworks display in my face as I shorted my little 
wrench between the chassis and this wire.

   Since the clutch hydraulics are fed from the brake fluid reservoir, you 
will need to keep the reservoir topped off at all times. I suggest examining 
the reservoir, and noting the level on the reservoir at which the clutch 
hydraulics are fed. The reservoir was designed so that in the event of a leak 
in the clutch hydraulics, the reservoir would not be emptied (hey, you 
wouldn't want to loose your brakes!). You will need to keep the brake fluid 
level above this point to avoid sucking more air into the lines.

Stuff you will need:
  o NEW Brake fluid
  o ~ 2 feet of clear hose to connect to the bleeder
  o a clear jar to bleed old fluid into
  o a small wrench to open and close the bleeder (7mm ???)
  o An assistant:
    Unless you have a pressurized bleeder, you WILL need an assistant who 
    is willing to crawl under the dash and manipulate the clutch pedal 
    with their hands. I suggest you choose the time at which you make this
    request wisely! (Bad times are right after your SO has eaten dinner or 
    taken a shower.)
  o Jack stands, Jack, etc..
   To access the bleeder on the slave cylinder, you will need to jack up 
   the vehicle. I placed mine on 4 jack stands. Take standard precautions..


The clutch on these cars has a spring mechanism to assist in depressing of 
such. When there is no hydraulic pressure (due to a large leak, air in the 
system, etc) the spring will push the pedal all the way to the floor, and hold 
it their. It is therefor necessary to manually pull the clutch pedal up off 
the floor in order to re-fill the master cylinder with fluid prior to 
depressing it again.

Assuming you have jacked up the vehicle, disconnected the battery, an 
assistant ready to help, attached clear plastic tubing over the bleeder, and 
placed the other end of the tubing in a clear jar with some new brake fluid in 
it:

Assistant: push clutch to floor
You      : open bleeder until fluid velocity slows down, but hasn't stopped
           yet, close bleeder
Assistant: pull clutch up off floor

Repeat (and check fluid level of course!) until clean bubble free brake fluid 
flows from the bleeder.

Now that your SO/assistant is pissed off at having to pull that clutch up off 
the floor for the past half hour, it is a perfect moment to ask for their help 
as you bleed the brakes. (If you start hearing complaints, just remind them 
they can now sit in the driver's seat and just press the pedal.....)

my 2 cents for the week,

Ezra
