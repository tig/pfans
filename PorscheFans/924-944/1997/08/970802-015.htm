 Why not hook up the brake cooling pump to the brake light switch? It
 would seem to make more sense to me.

 Chris,

This would also work. This system is used only for track use, autocross or
time trial. It really isn't needed on the street. With the circuit on the
brake light switch, the spray would be on for a shorter period of time (less
time on the brakes than on the gas), and there would be less air flow with
the spray (speeds and air flow rapidly dropping while the brakes are on).
Also there is the issue of the brake lights being on in pregrid, while it is
not a good idea to spray water on hot but not moving or air washed rotors.
This requires another on/off switch to turn them off while in grid, and on
again on the course, one more thing to forget, either on or off. When used on
the 951, the advantage of the throttle body switch is that it is optimized
for both intercooler and brake use. It becomes a no brainer for either turbo
or NA car. Turn it on at the beginning of race day, refill the water tank on
each track break and smile.
