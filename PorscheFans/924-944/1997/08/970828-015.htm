Hello Everyone:


        I just can't help myself but to reply to this issue of everyone
getting
picked on by the police. I am a Police officer in Columbus, Ohio and
also own three red Porsche?s 84 944,86 951,89,951 again all red. But I
am not the donut eating pencil neck rookie on the street. first of all
most cops donut like donuts. Donuts are convenient because you only get
a 1/2 hour for lunch which you rarely get because you are on a call or
picking on a red Porsche owner. We all do not have pencil necks either
my is a 18 1/2" which I think is a tree trunk.


Here is a little help from a Po Po's Porsche owning view of mind. Police
officers are human but we also have feelings and some times do make a
mistake. You hate us when we are not there and love us when we are
there, and hate us when we leave. Sorry I am getting on my kick again.


"Yes I also am guilty of speeding too". How can you not be when your
going down the road with the best built car ever and the it does not
even began to turn on until about 90 and "wham" there sits the STATEY
(short for highway dude). You get your rights violated and get yanked
over. First thing do not get an attitude (It was your foot on the gas
pedal). Nine times out of ten I pull people over for going over 10-12
over the limit to ask them to slow down I understand your are driving
and well tuned German etc. car. And I will check your drivers info along
with proof of insurance.


Anyway of the five Porsches that I have pulled over for speeding or
reckless ops three of them were stolen of which two of them still had
the keys in them. If you speed and drive like you are at the Indy you
draw attention to yourself and that is what we are trained for (
Probable Cause ) you need a violation to pull any body over and must
justify it to your peers. In regards to the amount of the fine the
police do not set this the people that you vote for do it. Also my two
cents on insurance companies get to rich off of people that make a human
mistake such as speeding etc.


The best thing to get the SPEED out of you system do like I do. Go to a
drivers school ( THERE IS NO PO PO ON THE TRACK ) and Porsche owners are
the most respectful people that I have ever met and have never gotten a
rotten attitude from them while stopping them.


Yes all types of red cars do attract attention for some reason.


If you feel the need for speed make a dry run around the area. and if
you get yanked over place a donut on top of your drivers license and
hand it over.


Also try this.

Some FAQ's


1. Does radar work ? Yes in the cruiser it does. but does yours ?


2. What is vascar ? It is a timing device that measures speed over
   a distance and reports the speed of the vehicle ( Most Common Used)


Sorry I could keep on but hopefully this gives you a view of a PO PO's
Porsche owning view of mind. We all love nice cars and the majority of
us own them.


Be Safe
