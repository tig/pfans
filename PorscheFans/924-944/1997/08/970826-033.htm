Hey,

While reading a recent posting about finding the proper tap point for an =
aftermarket boost gauge, I remember someone ( I think it was Farzaan) =
stating that the DME/KLR drives the stock boost gauge electrically.  Can =
anyone confirm this? =20

Also, if so, is the signal sent to the boost gauge controlled or =
controllable via the DME/KLR chips(firmware)?  I know the KLR unit has a =
pressure transducer mounted directly to the PC board where the manifold =
pressure line connects in order to measure boost pressure.  Just =
wondering if it were possible that the aftermarket chip suppliers could =
be a little 'enthusiastic' when reporting the boost. ( Of course they =
wouldn't do that !)

Which leads to the next question - has anyone ever *verified* the stock =
boost gauge reading with a seperate boost guage with the aftermarket =
chipsets?  Is it normally close to the actual pressure?  Of course one =
should allow for the possibility that the KLR pressure transducer could =
degrade over time.

One last thing - Do the DME and KLR units work independently, or do they =
communicate in any way?

Just curious.....

BTW - Where's Farzaan been lately?
