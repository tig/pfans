A few misc. things I need help with:

A)    Turbo Cup Suspension - Does anyone have experience with this?  My
intention is to set up my '86 951 for fun on the track and then learn how to
drive it.  Are these goods worth $1,500.00?  Will this be detrimental to
autocross performance?

B)    I am looking forward to the M030 (968) sway bars I just ordered for my
951.  Does anyone know if they are difficult to install?  I am simply hoping
they come with directions.  Hopefully my car will handle like Bill Gilbert's
on the NNJR autocross circuit.

C)   Is there anything I should know before I just remove the heater control
valve to replace it?  Will the coolant that is bound to stream out of the
hoses damage anything if I permit it to just run to the driveway?

D)   I have an "early" '86 951.  The used Fuchs (front, 7x16) I bought for my
R1's need a spacer that is about 1/4" thick in order to clear the calipers.
 Does anyone know what offset these wheels are?  Does anyone know what offset
I should have?  Does anyone want to swap?

E)   My brake pad warning light has been on for nine years (that is not a
typo).  Nine years ago I replaced the pad wear sensors in an attempt to turn
the lamp off.  I have since even given up hope of the bulb burning out.  Is
this warning lamp connected to the computer some how?  I would think it
should be a simple idiot light that uses a conductor in the pad wear sensor
to make contact with the rotor and provide the gound to complete the circuit.
 Currently all of the pad wear sensors are off of the car - but, the light
shines on.  Anyone know any tricks for correcting this?  - Short of
recommending taking the dash apart and removing the bulb?

F)   Does anyone have one of the little plastic covers (covers two screws)
that resides just to the left of the passenger side A/C vent on the dashboard
of a 951?  It is about 1/2" wide and 1-1/2" tall.  They also reside elsewhere
on the dash.

G)   Can someone confirm that my '92 968 uses the same oil filters as my '86
951?

H)   Thanks for your patience!!!
