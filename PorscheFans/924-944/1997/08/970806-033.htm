The discussion about 951s compared to 911s has motivated me to provide
my perspective. I have an 88 951S that I've had for 2 years. Our local
PCA (Wild Rose) held a driver's ed a couple of weeks ago. Being a track
"virgin" I signed up along with 21 other members. I've never had so much
fun (activities with my wife exculded) in my whole life! What a BLAST!
There were 3 944 turbos, an 87 chipped, my 88 (stock), and an 89
chipped. The one thing that I really noticed (and very much enjoyed)
was  that the three of us would lap together, catch the 911s up in the
curves and blow by them on the straights. Next to a 97 911 turbo S the
quickest car on the track was the chipped 89 951S. I can't wait to get a
chip (thanks Farzaan for your fabulous assessment of the various
chipsets) and get back to the track.
