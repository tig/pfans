     All of the Mercedes Benzes and most of the BMW's I've seen have 
     Sekurit glass too.  Maybe some list members with these cars can help 
     with this matter?  Has anybody had any problems with stickers on their 
     (gasp!) M3's or C36's?

No stickers should be attached directly to the Sekurit glass.  I do not 
have the owner's manual with me but I remember it saying that the car 
should come with special self-stick foil that can be used where stickers 
are needed to be placed.  Should one run out, the dealer (when they know 
anything)  should be able to get you some more.  Sekurit is not that rare, 
when I was looking for a new windshield every place I called first asked 
if I had the Sekurit windshield.
     
Wait a minute, I do not have an owner's manual, I do not even own a 944... 
Sorry, I cannot tell you on which page the reference is.
