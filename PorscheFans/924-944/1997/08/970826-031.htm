First of all, what is the option code you are mentioning??
Second, and for those with inquiring minds, the earlier thread about
Sekuriflex windshields versus Sekurit, the option code for Sekuriflex is
M462.  Also, in case anyone is interested, the Special model 944 Turbo 1988
(Turbo S) option code is M758.
If anyone else has questions regarding option codes, let me know and I'll
try to answer them as I get the opportunity.  I have a copy of the 1997
Porsche Fact Book, published by PCNA primarily as a sales tool for their
dealers.  I usually get one when I work the Porsche booth at the Chicago
Auto Show each year.  If it hasn't already been listed elsewhere on the
"net" (FAQ's?), maybe someone would like to do so.  I can make a copy of
the relevant pages and fax it to someone who has the time, knowledge, and
equipment.  Can't ever have too much info available, can we.

Turbo S to play with)
