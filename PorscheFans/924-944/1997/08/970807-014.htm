Howdy,
I have a 89 951 with16x7 & 9's
I had previously fitted D40 M2s in 225 & 245
I took them to the dump with about 50% tread left.
I now have Bridgestone S-02's in 225 & 245
These tires are IMHO as good in the wet as the D40s were in the dry. The
day I bought them it was raining heavily and I had a lot of fun out in
the hills. There is good grip from cold that was not evident in the
D40s. I have driven the S-02s hard and not managed to kill them. I have
put ~ 10k miles on them since March and I estimate at least 50% tread
left with none of the hardening that occurred with the D40s. I'm not
sure what winter weather is like in Ohio ( I live in New Zealand ) but
as long as you don't have a desire to go driving on ice or in the snow
you should check out this tire.

Richard.

I have a tire question:
I am trying to find new tires for my 1988 944 Turbo.
The last three sets of tires that I have used were:
Dunlop SP Sport 8000
Dunlop SP Sport D40M2
Dunlop SP Sport D40M2 - I think, it was a long time ago.
My Rims are 7x16 front and 8x16 rear.
I want to retain the 'Plus Zero' sizing - 225 50 front and 245 45 rear.
I drive my car year round in Ohio.
Wet traction is very important to me
Has anyone tried one of these new tires?
How do they compare with standard High Performance tires?

Thomas Bapu
1988 944 Turbo - still running all year round!
