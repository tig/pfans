Eric,

thanks for the kind words.  If the motor does not work at any speed, then 
I would suspect the resistor pack is the culprit, or at least it is the 
cheapest part.  It is located near the fan (you need to remove that 
plastic guard in from of the windshield).

If you get a Haynes manual (with the wiring diagram) you could try 
connecting 12 volts directly to the motor to test it.  Before sinking big 
bucks into it I would make sure that the motor is really shot.  You may 
just find a bad ground (that was what happened to mine) in the engine 
compartment.  Check and tighten all earth grounds running from the 
battery (there are at least two).

Have fun!

Marv
