All this talk about what is "X" car worth reminds me of some words
of wisdom my Dad passed on to me when I first got into cars and learned
that they can be expensive "toys."  He said, "Something is only worth
what someone else is willing to give you for it."  These are words to
live by.
    I've sold cars for way more than what I paid for them and taken a
bath on others.  Blue Book and NADA are nice market reference tools and
give you an idea of what to expect, but have little to do with our own,
individual reality.  Sorry for wasting BW.  Just felt compelled to pitch
in my $.02 worth.  Maybe it's worth less.  Any offers?;)
