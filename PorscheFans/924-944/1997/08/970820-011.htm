Chris -

It sounds as though the turbo removal is still in progress.  Any ideas how much
time has been spent and how much more is anticipated?  Would you still do it
again or pay $4-500 for a mechanic to do it?

I also have (2) questions for the group:

1.  Since all replies to my questions on switching to synthetic were "do it" I
will follow this advice.  Should I flush the engine with an engine flush
additive before making the switch?  Which one?  I only run the car in the
summer since Minnesota winters and 951's would not mix well (yes, winter really
sucks around here for many reasons - putting the Porsche away is one of the
biggest).  What is the best viscosity blend to use?  I presently use Castrol
20W-50.

2.  Anyone have a used AutoThority Mass Flow Sensor kit they want to sell?  Is
it a worthwhile investment?

TIA

Mark
