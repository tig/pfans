I have been busy under the hood lately as most of you can tell by my posts. 
 I have the following questions:

1). I installed Autothority 2.7 chips and boost bolt (banjo bolt) on my 89 
951 this past weekend and tried to use the AC for the first time today. 
 Whenever I accelerate with the AC on the fan slows to a crawl until I stop 
accelerating.  Weird!  I know that some performance computers shut down an 
AC compressor when full throttle is applied but this is only the fan, not 
the compressor.  It happens at any speed I accelerate.  I spoke with APE 
and was told it is coincidental to the chips but all worked well last week. 
 Could it be my resistor?? I thought that on speed 4 the resistor was out 
of the loop and would not affect the fan's operation.  I really hate to put 
the old chips back in just to test - what a pain!

2). With the new chips I notice a little improvement in low end torque and 
driveability and smoother acceleration but when in 3rd or 4th gear on the 
highway accelerating from about 4000 RPM the car feels much more sluggish. 
 I changed the Plugs with the chips and the car has 90K on it.  In general 
there seems to be a flat spot in the torque curve at 4000-4200 RPM.  Can 
anyone else comment???? Farzaan - the Cup car computers you spoke of and 
tested, are they just chips or would I have to buy the whole units????

3). My front tires are now gone after about 13K miles.  They are Dunlop 
SP8000.  I have been happy with the traction and in the back of my head I 
knew that they would not last long but 13K went by much quicker than I 
expected.  Has anyone who used SP8000s tried anything that works as well or 
better and lasts longer?  These tires have never seen the track.

As always, thanks for the great info!  The members of this list are 
excellent!
Mark
