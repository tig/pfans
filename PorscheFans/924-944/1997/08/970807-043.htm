Hello PorscheFans,

I have the worst Porsche story in the world and I need some advice from
pros.  Here goes.

I bought my dream car in may of this year, a gold 1987 944S loaded with
options for 10100 CAN$.  Bought it from a dealer in Montreal, 12 hours away
(10 in a Porsche) and brought it back home no problem.  The dealer who sold
me the car owns a used car lot and sold it to me with 30 day warranty.
Everything's rosy in my world until I get home.  First, doesn't pass the
safety check because of unsafe tire wear.  O.K., add 1000$ set of high
performance tires.  Then, car battery dies, fine add 100$.  But then 11
days later, motor blows, blown connecting rod bearing.  Since the closest
Porsche dealer is 10 hours away I decide to have it fixed locally.  But,
dealer who sold me the car doesn't want to pay because she says I abused it
(first major problem, warranty doesn't pay).  The machine shop says the
bearing blew because of over-rev or cold start.  Is it possible to over-rev
these babys even with a rev-limiter?

Anyway, order idlers, tighteners, belts, waterpump, motormounts, rings,
bearings, gasket sets, seals etc... add 1400$.  Then, mechanic says I need
to change my clutch and shaft, O.K. add 1600$.  Machine shop magnafluxs
crank, oversizes bearings, re-rings pistons, hones cylinders etc...add
1400$ (anybody found second major problem yet?)  Supposedly, on these cars
you can't touch the cylinders because you de-ciliconise them (as when the
honing was done).  Anybody ever heard of this?  Please tell me this isn't
true!!!  This means i've spent around 5000$ and now I need to replace the
motor because it's garbage because of the machine shop.

Please help, when the garage sends the bill for removing and reinstalling
the motor it will be 2000$.  Which sends the bills up to 7000$ plus new
motor which is 4000$.  That's doubling the price of my car and still no
warranty...

Sorry my story took so long but thank you in advance for any advice or
positive storys of motor rebuilding and honing...

Yours truly,

Pierre
