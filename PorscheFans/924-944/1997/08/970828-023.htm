     Sorry to prolong this thread but I had to put my $.02 in.
     
     First of all, I used to think that the 65mph speed limit was too slow. 
     That was until I drove across country in a brand-new 1996 Chrysler 
     Lebaron.  I realized how close the average driver is to their car's 
     limits even at those speeds. VERY crappy brakes, extremely weak 
     headlights, handling that would turn a defensive lane-change into a 
     roll-over.  I feared for my life traveling above 60 at night, and I 
     certainly don't want people in cars like these going any faster than 
     60 when I or my loved-ones are on the same roads.   This is not to say 
     that I drive my 951 at the speed limit, FAR FAR from it. But I hope 
     the officer takes into account the superiority of my equipment when he 
     decides whether or not to enforce the law.  (I admit, as a car guy,  
     If I were a cop I would probably pull over the Porsche instead of some 
     boring minivan, but I'd be more likely to write a ticket to the 
     minivan driver). Treating the cops with some basic courtesy has 
     usually gained me fair treatment from them. (As a cop I would also 
     write the ticket to the snotty Porsche driver over a polite minivan 
     driver)
     
     Second,  I don't get harassed nearly as much now that I drive a nice 
     Porsche (and since I've cut my hair). I used to get pulled over once 
     every two weeks (on average) in my  yellow VW  Scirroco with the 
     boy-racer-go-faster racing stripes.  I guess now I look more like a 
     contributing member of society (but I'm still pretty young to be 
     driving a Porsche).  If they pull over Porsches because they think the 
     car is stolen, then I figure this may get my car back sooner in the 
     event it  actually is stolen. 
     
     Finally, while I agree with the majority of both of the guys who 
     posted the police officer's perspective, I figured I'd point out the 
     problem with the stealing-murder-rape analogy.  The reason even a 
     little theft etc. Is illegal is because it is always wrong to steal, 
     always wrong to rape someone, and always wrong to murder someone.   
     Speeding on the on the other hand is illegal, not because it is wrong 
     to arrive at your destination early, but because there is A CHANCE 
     that you will cause an accident and hurt someone or damage their 
     property. Hurting people and damaging property is wrong, but a little 
     speeding, or speeding in a car specifically designed to drive faster 
     than most, means the CHANCE that something WRONG will happen is not 
     very big.  Certainly, the probability that I will have an accident is 
     MUCH higher if I am driving a minivan at 65 vs a properly maintained 
     Porsche at 85.  To correct your analogy  (no offense, just an 
     entertaining argument) it would be as follows:
     
     Because speeding is illegal because you MIGHT have (or cause) an 
     accident:      
     Then All weapons should be illegal because you MIGHT use them to 
     murder someone (even a little)
     And Hands should be illegal because you MIGHT use them steal from 
     someone (even a little)
     and all Penises should be illegal because you MIGHT rape someone (even 
     a little). 
      
     In other words, speeding alone does not mean you have done the bad 
     thing the law is written to prevent.  I agree with the point you were 
     making, but I couldn't help poking some light hearted fun at your 
     argument. 
     
     Time for me to stop rambling,
     Rod Wiggins
