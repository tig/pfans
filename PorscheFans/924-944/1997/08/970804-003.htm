In a message dated 97-08-02 23:58:30 EDT, you write:

<< After about a year of soaking up a minor seep under the reservoir with
 three Bounty paper towels folded and jammed between the two lines and the
 frame, I thought I would finally fix it by installing the new suction
 line between the reservoir and the pump. (BTW, the paper towels caught
 all the seepage. It occurred only after parking...never noted any fluid
 after driving). >>

I had a similar problem on my 87 944-S,  and based on the good advice 
of a list member,  I removed the power steering resevior from the car, 
thoroughly cleaned it, and sanded the little mold seam line marks from 
the nipple ends on the bottom of the resevior with 400 grit sandpaper.

The fine seam lines were apparently enough to cause the seepage.  Since
this cheap/no money repair I have had no leaks.  

Good Luck
