OK, people

As I started this, now overwhelming, thread I'll try to summarize:

A number of list members have written to me, some with positive, some
with negative remarks. 

Many was upset with me comparing murder, rape and robbery with speeding.

My idea was to compare with violent and molesting crimes, that could
easily create bodily and mental damage, just as car accidents wich may
be caused by excessive speed.

On a moral end ethical standpoint, there is ofcourse a world of
difference and for those truly hurt by that comparison - please forgive
me.

A few lines of thought (?) emerged in answers to the original post

One was that the police single out Porsche drivers and harass them. 
To me this seems unlikely. Maybe we will the same story from every
compound group of people, regardless of car.                 

Another was that speeding tickets was not connected in any way to
safety, just economics. Some argued that speed have no influence at all
to road safety, as some argued in favor for speed limits. Statistics may
be available to support either theory.                         

A popular argument was that "speeding is OK in Porsches, as they are so
good cars - but maybe not in an old banger". Likewise, many argued that
speeding is a personal risk thing only.    

It seems that most people verify my original point, that speeding is
different from maost other traffic rules. It is certainly one of those
rules that exist everywhere but is taken very lightly upon by many
individuals.  

Thoughts that did not emerge:

Why is mutual insurance companys rising premiums for speeders, if speed
have no real impact on accident rate? 

Why did nobody present the hard facts about kinetic energy (energy
stored in moving bodys - such as red Porsches). The forces involved is a
square function of velocity (speed). In real word terms, that means that
a Porsche going 60 is four times as hard to stop as Porsche going
30...
