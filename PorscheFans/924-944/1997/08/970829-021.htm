Early this spring I had to have my A/C serviced because of a freon leak
(Pro-Formance Place, Inc. Marietta, GA - Porsches only and Reggie Cumming
is the owner an extremely great guy to deal with) .  He replaced the
condensor, refilled and checked the system.  All was well until about the
end of July when I noticed the A/C was freezing cold anymore.  I returned
the car to Reggie and this time the high pressure hose was leaking.  He
replaced the hose, refilled and checked the system and now I have freezing
cold A/C again.  

BTW, he makes his own hoses and only charged $125 for the hose.  He told me
the factory hose was around $300.  I haven't checked the dealers price to
see if this is true but I've heard the factory hoses are very expensive.   

Now to my point about the R134 conversion.  I asked Reggie about doing an
R134 conversion and he has done serveral successfully.  He told me the
seals and evaporator/dryer would have to be replaced.  The total cost is
around $350-$375 for everything.  Just thought I'd pass that along because
I've read where many on the list have done the conversions.
