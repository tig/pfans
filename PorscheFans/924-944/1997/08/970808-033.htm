Yesterday, my wife and I were driving our '86 N/A Guards Red 944 to the 
grocery store (Ok, I was driving). We passed by a local foreign auto dealer 
(where we bought our 944 last fall for $4900), and sitting in the lot was a 
charcoal gray '86 Turbo 944. I just had to take it for a test drive, so today 
I went to the dealer for my lunch break. The sales guy said they were asking 
$12,500 for it! (76kmiles) Well, I knew it wasn't worth it, but a test drive 
was certainly in order. I quickly checked the wheels for play, fairly tight, 
about the same amount of strut play as ours. He gave me the keys, the engine 
started just fine, no unusual noises. I saw a break in the traffic, started to 
go, it almost stalled! Wow, the low end torque was certainly less than on our 
NA. I took it for a drive down the highway, and then on some back country 
roads. The boost went up to ~1.8->1.9 BAR on the guage at WOT. Torque above 
~4,000 RPM is fun! However, I could feel and hear the clatter of the waste 
gate at WOT, making acceleration slightly jerky, and generally detracting from 
the feeling of quality I am used to. I found the turbo LAG to be annoying, I 
would probably get used to it though. Perhaps chipping helps this. Yesterday I 
was dreaming of having a turbo, today, I am very satisfied with the N/A we 
already have. Perhaps driving Farzeen's car would change my mind?

Other things I noticed during the test drive:
 o sunroof electrics were screwed up
 o passenger side window switch on the drivers door was busted
 o Drivers side window had some sort of problem with the sliders
 o slight wheel shimmy on the highway
 o Charcoal Gray doesn't look all that sharp (hope I am not offending anyone..)
 o 16" phone dials and those TURBO calipers look great
 o Transmission was slightly more difficult to shift than ours with 233kmiles
 o Clutch pedal had more resistance
 o I HATE SPEED LIMITS (sure glad the cops didn't catch me today..)

Well, enough rambling for now...

Ezra
