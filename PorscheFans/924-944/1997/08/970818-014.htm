Wes,

> Well since we're talking about oldest 944' I thought I'd try for latest

  When I bought my 1991 951 from Porsche AG in Stuttgart last March, 
I was curious as to where my car fit into the production line too. So 
I contacted the Technical Bureau of Porsche AG, and they faxed me 
several pages of information (coupe/cabrio, Vin #'s, engine type, 
trans, Din-PS etc) of all 944's produced from MY 85. (Including the 
178 951 ROW cars with 290 PS, engine type M44/50, weighing in at 1280 kg!)
  Is your car USA spec? According to this information from Porsche 
for MY 91, Vin #'s from WPOAB294MN410001 - 410510 are USA S2's. I
thought that cars sent to Canada were ROW cars? If so, the Vin #'s would be 
WPOZZZ94ZMN400001 - 402608. Also, the ROW S2's put out 211 PS vs 208 
PS for USA models and weighed  20 kg less than USA S2's. According to 
this information there were another 562 S2 USA Cabs & 1140 S2 ROW Cabs in 
MY 91 too.
  The 1991 951 I have is WPOZZZ95ZMN100211, which is # 211
out of 250 951's produced in MY 91, the last year for the 951 : ^ {.
Any later models on this list?
