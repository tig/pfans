hey guys,
  My water pump finally went out on me.  Its squealing like a stuck pig.
So i called the folks at Vertex and ordered a rebuilt pump.  No problem...
until UPS goes out on strike.  Now my pump has been sitting in a warehouse
in Montgomery since August 1.  Being a UAW member I know I'm supposed to
support the strikers but it's really frustrating when it affects you
directly.  I'm not very optomistic about seeing this water pump anytime in
my lifetime so I was wondering...

  Is it ok to drive the car?  The pulley is not loose, I'm not losing any
coolant and its not running hot.  The only thing that worries me is that
the pulley will come flying off and I'll lose the cambelt.  And we all know
what will happen then.

Anxiously awaiting your replies,
Terry
