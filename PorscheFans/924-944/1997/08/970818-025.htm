Policeman:  Sir, you look like hell, are you OK?
Me:  I...  I don't know.
Policeman:  Were you raped, sir?
Me:  I..., I think so...

Well, I have my car back from the shop.  Of course, the oil pressure,
which they said was nil is perfectly fine (5 bar all the time), and of
course I got stranded the next morning at my daughter's daycare because
they left my battery connected and let it drain completely to nothing. 
(Then they charged me for a new battery)!  They charged me over $1,000
for changing the timing chain and fiddley-frigging around with the oil
pressure, and it STILL has the same noise it had when I took it to them.
 No resolution of that whatsoever.

The owner told me to take it somewhere far away to a dealer who knows
little about Porsches, and try to sell it.  This car ran perfect when I
took it in except for the rapping, and now he's trying to tell me it's a
rat.  

Does anyone have the number to a Rape Crisis Hotline?

Anyway, the noise is still there.  It comes and goes.  It is light at
times and very loud at others.  It's not a deep knock, but more of a
clacking or rapping.  I don't know what a bad lifter sounds like, but
the owner of the shop thought it was a lifter before he raped me.  If
it's a bad lifter, is it going to do extensive damage if I drive the car
to work?  How about a drive 6 hours to Toronto?
