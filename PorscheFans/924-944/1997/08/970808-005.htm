You don't really *need* to take out the window, I didn't do it when I
replaced my rear speakers. Ofcourse, the speakers need to be a perfect fit,
since you can't see what you do if you don't take out the window to get the
panels off.. :)

To get out the window, push outwards. The gasket will follow! It is all in
one piece, and should come out with the window. When you reinsert the window
with the gasket on, lubricate it with some soap or something. Should make it
easier to put back in.. Better yet - take the car to a glass shop and let
them take the windows out. Replace the speakers while you are there. You may
have to take out the top of the back seats, so do that just in case. If you
don't take out the window, you definitely need to take it out.

Some people like to put them in the carpet above the two compartments in the
rear, but if you have a nice carpet I wouldn't take the chance of ruining
it.

The irony! :)

Ouch!
