Andrew and Kevin,

I, too, had trouble with the Sears Diehard lasting less than a year.
Batteries take a beating in Arizona heat.  I like Sears because you can get
them replaced almost everywhere.  The problem is the recommended battery in
their book is the wrong one with too low a rating.  On the second
replacement I noticed they carry a battery for imports that is recommended
for Mercedes and BMWs that has the same footprint but much higher rating
(sorry, I don't have the model no.).  Make sure you get that one, not the
one their book recommends. I have had no trouble since.
