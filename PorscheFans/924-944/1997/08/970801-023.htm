Hi P-fans,
	I am directing this question to Ezra or Dana, but anyone else is free
to add their $.02.
	My '88 NA has no alarm, factory or otherwise.  However, that is about
to change.  I see that most after market alarms have a single, flashing
LED somewhere in the dash.  I have looked at several and noticed that it
is just an LED with 2 wires running to the alarms "brain."  The circuit
to make the LED "blink" must be in the "brains."
	I have purchased from the dealership the 944 door locks with the built
in LED.  It also has two wires coming off of it.
	Now the question. Is it possible to split and splice the alarm's LED
leads, and run it to the LED locks in my doors?  Or am I running the
risk of frying my new alarm?  Please excuse my ignorance.  Any
assistance will be appreciated.

Mahalo (That's "Thanks" in Hawaiian),
