Auto boxes the way of the future eh? Now I believe that all those people
who only want to get from A to B should be condemned to death in a front
drive auto Honda. F1 cars actually use a manual gearbox . They have a
clutch too. Gear change is facilitated by sophisticated software and
electro-hydraulic actuators. Ferrari already has a auto for those too
rich, lazy, and stupid to learn to drive properly. It is the 456 GTA. It
sells well in America I'm told. I doubt they would add another one and
ruin an excellent vehicle. The 355 will employ a street version of the
F1 concept. Ferrari also sold Mondials as true clutchless manuals from
the late '80s till the end of production. The driver had two peddles and
a standard gear stick. The system was built for them by a French company
called Valeo who also fitted something similar to Lancia rally cars
around the same time. The RUF - Sachs EKS system is much the same in
operation. You still have to lift off the gas when you change, and you
can heel and toe on the way down.
Porsche shot itself in the foot ( IMHO anyway ) with the Tiptronic
concept. It holed the other foot buy putting in the 968. They  could
have had a full clutchless manual system in their cars with steering
wheel paddles and upped the ante. But they didn't. If Tiptronic is the
"light" I'm off to have my eyes checked.

Regarding racing and automatics, the F1 cars have automatic (well
mostly) automatic gearboxes. The driver shifts my pressing a small
paddle on the steering wheel. One paddle to upshift, one to down-
shift. F1 drivers like the new gearboxes because it allows them
to shift faster, and keep the accelerator floored.

See the light people! The 'Tiptronic' style gearbox is the way of
the future. The article in Racer described how the Ferrari F355
will be available with the automatic gearbox. It really sounds great.
