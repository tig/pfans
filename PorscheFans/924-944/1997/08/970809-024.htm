First a quick note and then 2 questions.

This is my first Porsche and I feel for everyone that has never experienced
the feeling of driving one of these automobiles.  I've had mine for 2 years
now and wanted it since I was 18.  I vowed that when I could afford it, I'd
buy a 1983.  It took almost 3 years of searching, but I found mine and
couldn't be happier.  It's wonderful to read all the notes of others enjoying
theirs as much as I do mine and the quality of the discussion keeps me coming
back.

Now my questions:  This past winter I changed my radiator, thermostat and
thermo fan switch.  I stayed with the oem thermostat but it was recommended
by a local "Porsche" specialty shop that I go with the lower temp thermo fan
switch.  Before all the changes, my car would creep to 3/4, the fans would
kick in with Hell's fury and turn off when the temp dropped to 1/4.  I live
in Long Island, NY and traffic for me on one way of my commute is 1 hour to
go 25 miles.  Since all the changes, the fans kick in just above 1/2 but
NEVER turn off until I turn the car off.

I've read comments on the fans not helping with flow when driving, but given
my one-way crawl, should I stay with the lower temp switch or is it
recommended that I revert to the way it was.  

My second question is about a firend's '83 944.  He gets water on the
passenger's side rear footwell with any rain.  Neither the windows, doors nor
roof leak.  Where can the water be coming from?

By the way, I can personally recommend Red Line's Water Wetter.  I noted the
time to reach 1/2 on the guage in nearly the same temperatures with cold
enging idling (this was before all the changes).  It took just over 2 minutes
longer to reach 1/2 WITH Water Wetter in the system.  For those worrying
about temps, this seems a cheap ($6.95) add'l precaution.
