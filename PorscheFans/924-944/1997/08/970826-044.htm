944 NA?

<P>--
<BR>Russ,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just purchased the Bosche 13913 Ford Mustang
Sensor. According to the
<BR>sales guy the only difference between three wire sensors is the wiring
<BR>harness/connector? If this is true, the higher price of "universal"
<BR>replacement units must be a result of supply and demand due to lack
of
<BR>consumer awareness.. Given the high price of the direct replacement
for our
<BR>cars, the connectors sure are worth their weight in gold!

<P>&nbsp; Does anyone have info on what a three wire O2 sensor signal should
look
<BR>like? I would like to scope it out to make sure I have correct O2 sensor
<BR>operation with the 13913 unit.

<P>Thanks,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ezra

<BR>>Subject: O2 Sensor
<BR>>
<BR>>A while back someone posted on the list they had installed an O2 sensor
<BR>>for a mustang in their 944.&nbsp; I was wondering how it worked as
I am going
<BR>>to replace my sensor soon.&nbsp; I was shopping around for prices
and found
<BR>>the following:&nbsp; Porsche direct replacement - $179.00, Universal
3 wire -
<BR>>$69.00, Mustang 3 wire - $31.00.&nbsp; So the questions are, will
the mustang
<BR>>O2 sensor work or should I shell out the extra $38.00 for the universal?
<BR>>And, are the wires color coded the same as the original or do I have
to
<BR>>guess at how to splice the wires together?&nbsp; Or is there another
