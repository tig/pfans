Hi Mark,

I have the same problem.  The jack points on the car (at the four =
corners and inside of the wheels) have those round humps that just don't =
fit the usual U-shaped jack stand support saddle. Even when it's on four =
jack stands it doesn't look too stable from underneath.  Too bad jack =
stand support pads aren't shaped like floor jack lifting pads (I wonder =
why?).

My usual procedure for lifting the car is to lift with two floor jacks.  =
These fit the center lift point 'humps' nicely.  I'll lift from the =
center lift point - the one below the 'diamond' depression below the =
door - to the point where I can get two jack stands at both front and =
rear support points on that side.  I'll then lower the jack a little =
until both jackstands are supporting the weight but I leave the =
floorjack in place for extra safety.

Then I repeat for the other side of the car but I jack that side up a =
little higher than the other and then put the jackstands in place and =
lower.  I then iterate from one side to the other, going up a little at =
a time, until I've got the car up as far as I like, essentially =
'walking' each side up a bit at a time - but always letting the =
jackstands hold the weight of the side opposite the side I am lifting.  =
And I always leave the floorjack in place in the center position for =
safety - if possible.  ( OK, sometimes I use one floor jack)

It would be nice if you could get jack plates that fit the normal =
jackstands U-shaped supports and the car's lift points for an =
inexpensive price.  I just have always done without 'em.  But yes, the =
jack stand saddles don't fit the lift points very well.  I'll admit that =
using stock jack stands alone doesn't look too stable - that's why I =
leave the floor jacks in place if possible.

Most of the aftermarket Porsche parts suppliers have the jack plates. =
You'll need 4 probably to make them worth having so you can lift the =
whole car.  I haven't found a way to safely lift from a corner lift =
point of the car and place a jackstand anywhere to hold up that corner.  =
I'm *not* gonna put a jack or a jack stand one under those front =
aluminum A-arms or even the rear aluminum suspension.  I've always just =
lifted the entire car.

I don't think there is any front center or rear center point to lift =
from.  I guess you could lift the rear from the bottom of the =
transmission, but I *would not* try it.

It's really is nice to have a front or rear center lift point though - =
It makes changing oil on my Honda really easy.  My procedure for lifting =
the 944 is lengthy and maybe someone else has a better way short of =
buying a tower lift!

Of course I'm the one that still removes and replaces the damn belly =
pan(s) everytime I change the oil too.  I just can't seem to bring =
myself to missing the pleasure of removing and reinstalling all those =
10mm bolts.....

Well I finally got four jack stands and I need some guidance.  I spent =
some=20
time under the car yesterday but was very uncomfortable.  I placed rear=20
stands (2 Ton) under the squarish looking hole in front of the rear =
wheels=20
and the front stands (3 Ton) under the recessed round jacking points =
behind=20
the front wheels.  I would really like to place the stands under =
something=20
like an axle that runs across the car and fits into the saddle of the =
stand=20
better.  Any ideas????

Thanks!
Mark
