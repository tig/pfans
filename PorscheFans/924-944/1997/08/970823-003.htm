1940 - 1950 Auto-Unions ( Audi ) were front wheel drives and had the
engine in the back if I'm not mistaken .

First cars to have front wheel drive came from France, Citroen to be
precise in the 20's-30 with the so called "traction- avant" and several
cars from this maker " DS, AX  etc are the same way with pretty good
racing record on their belts. Little Renaults R5's, Peugeots 205,105,
306, are all for the world rally front wheel drive, like wise some
Lancias. Of course they had teh beautifull B groups with 205 evolution 2
4wd, Lancias Integrales, Audis Quattros and some RS200 that dominated
the world for quite a bit. Even some 911/59 were used during this period
to break those little cars domination. If I'm not mistaken, the 911/59
came to race also the Paris Dakar winning of course, but in the second
year, the 205 won several years in the row, and the Quattros came to
dominate Imsa in the 80 after the ban of the B group.

If you ever sat on a Lancia Beta or a 205 2.0 16avlves you would see
some differences. Not very sedated drivewyse....
 It would also be O.K. on cars that are just

Anyway we both got 50% righton all that but after driving a full wheel
drive Quattro and An Integrale, boy that's the way to go. Both in
performance and in handling...
