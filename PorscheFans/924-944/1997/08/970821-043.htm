> I understand
it to be a good solid reliable water cooled engine with very little
problems? Am I mistaken?  An option currently is to keep the car as is
(manifold/exhaust intact) and get it registered, titled and insured in
the state of Virginia.  What do you think?  Another option is to (thru
the civil court) try and make to saler take the car back and get my
money back and buy a "Real Porsche"?  How do I make the best of this
tough situation?<

You already own a "real Porsche".  The 924 is an outstanding car.  If you=

have good tires, shocks and a tuned suspension, you will have an excellen=
t
driving machine.  Read the FAQ and root through the archives to find out
the strong and weak points of your car.  Join the Porsche club, it is the=

best $36 a Porsche owner could spend.  The other club members can give yo=
u
the name of a local shop to check out your car.  Spend the bucks for a
complete inspection.  If there are any big problems, nail the seller.  If=

the car checks out, there are lots of parts sellers listed in Pano to hel=
p
you restore your 924.

Remember, the 914 is part VW and it consistently kicks more than its fair=

share of butt on the track and that includes some big dollar iron.  I do
not think there is a Porsche built that does not have some Audi, BMW  or =
VW
common parts.

Welcome to the group.
