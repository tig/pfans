Full soft will be stiffer than your '86. We can revalve the unit if needed.
The rebound adjustment is a small tab that extends off the top of the shock
shaft...just pop your hood and Koni supplies you with a knob that fits the
tab...takes just a couple seconds. The compression is adjusted on the bottom
of the strut. There is a small dial with holes in it that you turn, I
usually use a small allen wrench.
