I hate to get involved in this thread because it belongs on the 'tavern'
list, but I really have to comment on these:

<<However, in the state of Missouri and I believe in the whole of US of
A,
_nobody_ is allowed or supposed to be above the law. PERIOD. 
Consequently, it is illegal for anyone to disobey the speed limits. This
includes fire trucks, ambulances, police cars, etc.  Excuses such as
emergency are a load of manure.  I had to take the Defensive Driving
course and the teachers were very explicit in how the speed limits apply
to everyone.>>

Are you suggesting the police in Missouri cannot exceed the speed limit
to catch speeders or in response to an emergency call? I dont think
so...

<<As a re-inforcement to my statement, remember that is also the reason
why
no ambulance, fire engine or police car personnel can force you to
commit
a traffic violation by crossing a red light when they are behind you
with
lights on and horns blaring(ie emergency situation).  If they get on the
loudspeaker and give you hell, take their numbers and report them, they
are trained to either go around vehicles or wait for the light to turn
green.  If you cause an accident by crossing a red light, no judge will
excuse you because it was an "emergency". >>

So you are suggesting I contribute to the possible death of an
individual who is in the back of an ambulance running emergency so I
won't have to explain to my insurance company why I was involved in a
fender bender? We are now getting into the difference between justice
and law, which the last I heard is philosophy, which *really* doesn't
have much place on the 924-944 list! Suffice it to say that I *will* get
out of the way! And I shall have absolutely no trouble making the
decision between saving a life and damaging property! Here in Manhattan
this problem happens right under my window at least once an hour. The
people who won't cross the intersection and get out of the way to allow
an emergency vehicle by are endangering lives!
