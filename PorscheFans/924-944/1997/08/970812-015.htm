OK I have the answer to my own problem. The 944 was home sick. After leaving in the garage overnight the problem has disappeared. I feel better in some ways and worse in others. Intermittent problems suck. I did pull out my Bosch Motronic manual and there is a limp home setting. I still wonder if that was what happened. I have figured out that it had to be fuel injector management that was causing the cutting in and out. The only other factor that I can think of was the water being splashed around when they were buffing and cleaning the car. Judging by the looks of the engine compartment some of this was done with the hood open.
Anyway - it works fine now. I will post again if its dark side returns.
