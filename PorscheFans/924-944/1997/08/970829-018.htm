    Hello everyone.  The day before yesterday something terrible
happened.  Was was going about 65(around 65) an entered a turn faster
than planned.  You see when I tried to slow down a little before the
turn, the brake went to the floor with no result.  And having a little
worn tires did not help.  Needles to say, my car spun, and the rear went
over the curb and hit a empty parked minivan.  Fortunately Nobody was
hurt.  This happened right after I payed of my car, and right when me
and my wife were gettin g ready to move to Germany.
With this and my current budget it looks like we would be lucky to be
able to bring mountain bikes to Germany, let alone a car.  The Porshe is
not totalled, the rims are still straight, there is a bent tie rod, and
the rear above the bumper is caved in a little bit in the center.  The
right rear fender is slightly rippled from the impact.  And the frame in
the spare tire compartment is slightly bent.  The engine stilll runs,
but I need to find were the resivor is leaking.  This could not happened
at a worst time!!!!  Ive never wrecked a car like this, normally I get
hit by other cars, not wreck my own.  Is it wish full thinking to try to
get 1500$ for it?  It has Fuch rims, Recaro cloth seats that say Porsche
on them, no radio, and 111,000  Miles.  If I was able to stay In America
longer I would fix it myself, as it is not totalled.  Im sure it would
also make an excellent parts car.  If someone knows of a way to get
about 1500$ for my car please help:).
