Well, Mister Potter...

        Perhaps you're correct, and I am indeed a schmuck.

        I guess it comes down to the love of the car and not the money
invoved?

        For purely love reasons, I'm glad I did what I did with the 44. In
hindsight, and perhaps a lesson to those of you making the leap into a Porche
purchase...I should have not screwed around and went straight to a 911. 

        In a previous post, someone spent $4,500 on an 83, then sunk $4 more
into it.
That's gotta be love, right? Because in a value situation, it's like taking 4
grand and pissing it away.

       My post was not indeded to raise the price of my car, it was to warn
those about to take the plunge...
