Michael-
If it were me, I would let the dealer do it this time.  Chances are, he has
a "power bleeder" and you would want him to completely flush the system
since it has not been done for quite some time.  Once the system is fresh,
it is easy enough to do the routine  bleeding maintenance yourself (with a
pedal pumping partner).  I'm sure there will be lots of people at the track
to give you pointers and advice.  Basically, it requires the proper sized
wrench(es) and 3-4 feet of clear plastic tubing for the bleed fittings, a
disposable receptacle for the used fluid (an old pop bottle works just
fine), and extra new fluid.  I would also take along an extra set of brake
pads (particularly the fronts).  I'm sure the dealer would be glad to show
you how to change them if you don't already know the procedure.
You might also want the dealer to do a "pre-tech" on all of your suspension
components to make sure you don't run into any unexpected problems which
can't be corrected in time.  Regardless of how new the car is, or how it
has been treated in the past, you don't want to get to the track just to
find out that a bearing is loose or some other fault has occurred (which
could have been repaired in time) and have your car fail the tech
inspection.  Chances are, your region has a standard tech inspection form
that you and the dealer can go over to make sure everything is okay.  Do it
as soon as you can so that there is still time to make any necessary
repairs.  You will find the drivers ed experience much more enjoyable if
you can put your concentration and time into the driving rather than
vehicle maintenance.
If you like, e-mail me a fax number and I'll send you a copy of the Chicago
Region tech sheet used for all of our track events (including Road
America).  It will give you an idea of what to check for.
Have fun and give us report on your experiences
