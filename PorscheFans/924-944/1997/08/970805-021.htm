Hi Andrew,

Welcome to the club! I also own an '87 951 and have enjoyed it thoughly!

I can give you an idea on question 3:  Most people say that the =
*maximum* safe boost for a stock 951 is 1.1 bar (2.1 on the gauge) =
without adding too much additional risk of head gasket blow-out or =
engine longevity problems.  Remember, any increase in boost level risks =
a decrease in engine life and hightens the risk for damage of some sort. =
 And with any boost level, if you keep it floored 'cause you love the =
rush, the car's not gonna last as long.  The turbo's do see the most =
dramatic power gains with increased boost though.

With that said, the way to increase boost is through an aftermarket =
chipset for the DME and KLR computers.  The ones I know about are the =
Autothority and the Weltmeister (really by Dinan) brands.  The =
Autothority chipsets come in 3 stages for a more tailored performance =
level.  The other advantage to the Autothority chipsets is that only the =
chips and cycling valve(i think) needs to be changed to complete the =
installation.

The Weltmeister chipset (which I use), requires installing a wastegate =
shim to increase the wastegate valve spring tension.  This modification =
can be a real bear, especially on a 10 year old exhaust system.  The =
Autothority chipset is definately the easier install.  The Weltmeister =
(marketed by Automotion) gives about 0.9 bar boost (1.9 on the gauge) =
and a claimed 40 HP power gain.  Autothority give three levels of boost =
increase with three different chipsets - check with them on the actual =
numbers.  I don't know whose chipset is better power wise - ask the =
autocross guys.

The greatest advantage to me is not the peak HP and torque gains, but =
the extra driveability and reduction in turbo lag.  The car now feels =
much more like a V8 around town, but the turbo rush is still there when =
you floor it - just better :).

Anyhow, you will get a LOT of advice on this issue.  Make an informed =
decision before you modify your car.  Porsche engine parts and labor are =
expensive....

My 2 cents,

J. Dean Roberson

Subject:	87 951 brakes and sunroof

Hello all,
I am new to the list and am the proud new owner of a 1987 951 in =
pristine
condition.  I have a few questions that I am hoping some of you could
answer for me:
1. What size are the front and rear brakes and how many pistons are on
each.  I was told by a mechanic that he thought they were 4 piston f+r =
but
was not sure.

2. I need the new metal gears for the sunroof and the hand painted =
porsche
tire inflation caps; does anyone know where the cheapest place to buy =
them
is?

3. What is the stock boost and what is the maximum safe amount I can =
turn
it up to without changing anything stock?

Thanks for any help. =20

Andrew
