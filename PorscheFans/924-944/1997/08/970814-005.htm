<< I have two general questions regarding my '86 944T.  The first one is
about
 the brakes.  I have read the the 951's have four piston calipers.  Is this
 true?  Also, I have noticed that the brakes on my car require different
 parts (rotors, etc) than the '87 and on models.  Does anyone know the
 difference between the braking systems? >>

Yes, the 951s have 4 piston calipers.  Between '86 and '87, Porsche changed
the configuration of the rotor/hub assembly.  If I recall correctly, on the
earlier cars the rotor mounted to the "backside" of the hub flange; on the
later, to the "outside."
I believe this was done in conjunction with making ABS available as an
option, and may also have been accompanied by a change in the wheel bearings.
 This also accounts for the difference in wheel offset/backspace between the
two years. I think the 944 FAQ has more on the topic.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The braking system is effectively the same.  Both systems share the same
calipers.  Rotors are different because of different offset whioch was
done to make room for ABS sensors.

The 87-89 models share the upgraded front spindles and wheel bearings
which were larer used in the C2 models.  The hubs are offset 30mm
outward.  86 models have had a history of spindle failure, especially when
brakes are upgraded.
