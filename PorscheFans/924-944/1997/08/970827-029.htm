Porsche Peers:

Love everything about my 924S....sleeker 924 body with the 2.5 944
engine.  Will probably be buried in it one day.  However, I have a
severe case of...sunroof envy.  Apparently 924S doesn't come with the
standard pop-out sunroof like the 944's which....basically sux.  Well,
at least mine doesn't have one.  Anyway, without whining too much, has
anyone ever attempted to transplant a 944 sunroof panel into a 924 or
924S roof (after, of course, making provisions and a hole for the panel
to go in)?

Would like a little wind action in the cockpit, and I know it will be
somewhat expensive, but in the lists opinion would I run into any
structural problems that I'm unaware of??  Geez, maybe I oughta make a
cabriolet out of it?  I remember someone saying earlier that he's never
seen one.  What say you?

Regards, Rick (87 924S)
