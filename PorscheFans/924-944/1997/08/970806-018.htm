Correct me if im wrong, but what you are saying is that for the best
results a small intercooler, plumbed in as close as possible to the
intake system is better than a larger intercooler, fitted in the nose.

I have to say that looking in the engine compartment there doesn't seem
to be that much room. The only possible place to fit this 951 intercooler
is infront of the rad.

The only other possible method I can see it to mount a flat intercooler
on top of the engine, ducting air from the bonnet vent. I belive the
GT's did it this way. Shame I can't afford a GT intercooler + pipes.

The car is intended mostly street driving with the odd Speed trial,
(eg. Brighton Speed Trials etc....) Lag could be a big problem. 
The car has just finished a engine rebuild and has a new K26 hybrid
installed. The rebuild was intended as a base on which to work on.
Now I know that the engine/turbo/clutch are solid I can start thinking
on some enhancements (No point in building on unsound foundations).

I wanted to sort out the intercooler as I want to install a Strut Brace
and since a intercooler tends to be fairly bulky I thought I would do
some planning before hand just incase they clashed.

If anyone has any comments on the following I would be very greatful.

         *     Fuel systems (including adding second set of injectors)
         *     High lift cams
         *     Breaks
         *     Exhaust Manifolds (I have been offered what I am told
               is a 924GT mainfold, looks like a manifold doubled back
               on itself. I have a part number some where which Ill post
               later.)

Cheers for any comment,

 Richard.
