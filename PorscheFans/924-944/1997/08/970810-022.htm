Ron,

Yes, this is all normal and quite correct.  With respect to the CV 
joint and halfshafts, think about what happens as either of the rear 
wheels loads or unloads, i.e., moves up and down.  The distance from 
the hub centre to the transmission grows and shrinks.  The genius thing 
about Rzeppa CV joints is that their design allows both articulation 
and this in-and-out motion.

The transmission on the 85.5 and later cars has a mounting which allows 
some sideways motion, and this is a good thing as well.  The earlier 
cars had mounts on either side of the differential case which had some 
flex, but much less than the later cars.  The later cars also got a 
scattershield over the rear cover, never been quite sure why.

Kevin
