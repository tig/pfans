This same thing happened to my car, and thanks to the advice of a list member
I fixed it myself for about 80 cents (plus shipping).  

There are little white plastic clips that are located just under the dash
near
the center of the car.  They attach a small motor/solenoid to a small rod
that operates the heater flap.  These clips are prone to break and can be
easily replaced with no tools.  I recommend you check this out before
paying 700 scoones.
