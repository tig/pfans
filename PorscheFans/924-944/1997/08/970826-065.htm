Im sorry you have a "Reflector" that doesnt look the best.  I have one
that is lights up and says "PORSCHE" and looks very good,very OEM .  In
fact I thought it was OEM until People told me it was an aftermarket
thing.  In fact I think it would look worse without it.  Maybe you can
find one that works better for you. Good luck.

I bought a lighted kit  with Porsche printed on it years ago.  The plasti=
c
license plate holder was cheap looking and drilling holes in the rear of
the car and bumper  were required.  The stock look suddenly looked much
better.  The reflector is still sitting in my garage.
