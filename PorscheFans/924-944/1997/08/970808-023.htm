Juha,

No such "atlas", unfortunately.  The Haynes manual does a pretty good job
on the earlier 2.5 8-valve cars, but if you get a 16-valve or a Turbo,
there's a lot that isn't covered.  I have the factory manuals, and find
them fairly incomprehensible, mainly because the information for a given
model is spread out in seemingly random fashion throughout the volumes. 
You'd also need a set of the technical information manuals to help sort
things out.  

If you want a good overview of the evolution of the 924/944 line, I
recommend a book by Cotton on the subject.  He does a good job of
identifying the upgrades over the years, and the pros and cons of each
model.

Like the rest of us, you have to fill in the gaps by checking out various
websites (e.g. 944 Corner, POC) for FAQs written by knowledgeable members
of PorscheFans, seek counsel from PorscheFans, get copies of all the
relevant Jim Pasha articles in Excellence magazine ($5/issue), or find a
good Porsche shop that knows specifically about 944s.  Panoroma, the PCA
magazine, also has a few technical articles on the 944s, but they seem to
cater to the 911s.
