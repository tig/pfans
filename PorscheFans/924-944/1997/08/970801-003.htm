A little help if you please.  My 85.5 944 has begun an irritating and

that

plugs,

Try a higher octane fuel.  I have a car I leave in Mexico to tow my boat
which runs about the same with the key off as on.  It is the low octane
Mexican fuel (Pemex or as I call it "Pee Mix") that causes the run on.  You
may also have carboned up combustion chambers.  The carbon continues to
glow and ignites the fuel after the key is turned off.  There use to be an
additive to clean out the carbon.  If neither of these great ideas work,
let out the clutch as you turn off the engine.  Not correct P procedure but
will keep the babes happy until you get the problem fixed.

BTW, thanks for taking the heat on the Dana "cute guys" issue.  I was about
ready to make a few humorous comments, saw your post and decided to wait
for the reaction.  On the see through P car bra, there was potential there
but I came up dry.

If it has tits or tires, I will have problems with it.
