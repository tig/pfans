SO does this mean that there should not be fluid on the other side of the 
plug?  It sounds like the PS fluid is leaking inside the steering rack and 
pooling and leaking out around this plug.  I must also assume that if the 
fluid is here that it is the boots as well since the boots are an extension 
of this piece that has the plug.  Is there a fix or am I due for a steering 
rack???

Thanks!
