Keith Hanson advised Wes Shew that his problem might be due to dirty
injectors and that Techron should be added to the fuel.  I have some
information about injectors that may be of interest.

When my DeLorean would not pass the state smog test, my mechanic tested the
injectors on a bench flow tester/cleaner.  He advised that four were spraying
poorly and cleaning didn't help.  The car passed with new injectors.

I had the intake manifold and fuel system off while repalcing the coolant
hoses and decided to have the injectors tested because it was easy to replace
them now if any were not perfect.  I found that a carburetor rebuilding shop
haad a bench flow tester/cleaner.  All injectors sprayed perfectly and the
flow rates were exactly the same.  Cost: $4.00 each.

This reminds me that about six weeks ago someone posted that when he removed
the intake manifold, there was some sand around the valves.  Well, since
reading that, I decided to use compressed air to insure that there would be
no loose grit anywhere.  I removed the fuel rail and injectors as instructed
in the Haynes manual and then removed the intake manifold very carefully.
 When I looked into the intake ports there was some grit around the valves.
 Cursing at it didn't make it go away.  The grit must have fallen in through
the fuel injector holes.  It must have loosened when the o-rings were pulled
out of the holes in the intake manifold and fallen down.  

I suggest that the intake manifold be removed with the fuel system intact.
 If this is not possible, spray cleaner at the injector bases before
removing.  CAUTION: I postulate that whenever the injectors are removed, some
grit falls into the intake system/cylinders and the car owner never knows.
