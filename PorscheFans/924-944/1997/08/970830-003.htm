Let's be scientific about this.  The obvious solution would be to run a 
control experiment.  One car (the experimental car) should be given 
physician plates, the other (control car) should have a set of placebo 
plates.  Since the plates face outward, it should be possible to do this 
without either car being aware of which plates are on which and affecting 
results.

Of course, it would be even better if you could do a double blind 
experiment and have a third party place the plates on the car so you 
would not know as well.

If this seems feasible, perhaps we could enlist other physicians around 
the country to do the same and increase our sample size.

Whichever route you take, all of us on the Porsche Fans list anxiously 
await the test results in a future issue of JAMA.
