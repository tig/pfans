Thanks to all who responded to my query about whether anyone had State Farm
Insurance.  I confronted my agent with the fact that others have their 944s
insured with State Farm and with $250 to $500 comprehensive/collision.  I was
told that the company varies it's requirements by state and that southern
California is a very high risk area.  $1000 comp/collision is all that I can
get here.  I told her that I will shop around and get back to her.

Thirty minutes later, she calls with the news that I now have $500/$500.  I
asked how she did it and was told "don't ask"!  Either they can write the
insurance or they can't.  She/they (the company) are playing games but I got
what I want.  The moral of the story is not to accept everything they tell
you.

Someone questioned why I was trying to stay with State Farm.  Several years
ago, when I thought that I was a great driver, I took one of my Maseratis
off-roading after a turn -- single car accident.  State Farm paid $29,400 to
repair the front corner.  Not even the radiator was damaged!.  Anyway, they
took good care of me, didn't raise my rates and still give me a good driver
discount because they don't count the first accident.  This was my first
accident.

By the way, after I realized that I was not the expert driver that I thought
that I was, I decided that I wanted to learn how to drive better.  I attended
the Alfa Romeo driving school with my DeLorean last fall.  One school without
ocassional practice doesn't help much.  So I decided that I should attend
time trials.  I needed a good car to do that in.  I researched possible
candidates: 240Z, MR2, RX7, 944.  Articles that I read all glorified the 944
and here I am.  I purchased the car to drive to work daily and take to the
track.  I didn't realize how much fun it would be driving to work.  I really
enjoy the car.  I'll attend the Alfa school again in September, wet skidpad
and everything, and then I will be ready to start time trials.

Many thanks to all of you who have helped my these last weeks.  I willl be
glad to help others as soon as I have something to offer.
