  Well, I have just completed the 16 hour process of fitting new Koni
(yellow) struts to my 87 944S.  Somehow, in my absent minded perusal of
this group's communications, I had come to believe that this was a "plug 'n
play" operation in which the only likely problem would be finding the right
extension cord.

    I, first of all, want to laud the efforts of JASON at PARAGON PRODUCTS
to assist me in at least four lengthy phone calls - not to mention selling
me the things at a price which made it reasonable to get involved (yeah,
the first hit is free).  However, be forewarned, this ain't like changing
spark plugs.  I'm no chimp in these matters as I have, without complaint,
changed both clutch cylinders, put in a new digital clock, changed a
control arm, put in a new fuel pressure regulator, replaced the electric
seat control, as well as pumping my own gas and changing the oil.

    First of all, the bolts holding the lower part of the strut are among
the toughest I have enocuntered.  The task is further confused by the
misleading instructions in Haynes and from this group suggesting that
camber settings can be retained by painrting the bolts or some such thing. 
Not only did this delay the process to no avail, but I now have hot pink
(nail polish) bolts which, I am sure, will embarass me to no end should I
be in an accident (its the same theory as wearing underwear).  Not to
mention the laughter at the alignment shop - "hey, here's another guy who
thought he could retain camber settings by painting his bolts!!!".

    The removal of the springs from the old strut is only accomplished with
the use of spring compressors.  I looked in vain for a set in my $40
Price-Costco tool kit, before hitting the streets.  They were available for
free at Pep Boys and for $10 a day at the local tool rental emporium.
Although, they turned out to be fairly easy to use, it was one of those
situations where I left the rental place to the sounds of laughter and
vague comments about my life insurance, and I had the feeling they were
very surprised to see me two days later. I had the Sachs/Boge original
equipment which require an operation involving a 7mm hex or allen wrench
and a 22m socket which is, quite frankly, way too painful to remember.  I
vaguely recall dropping heavy objects from the roof of my home on a vice
grip while my oldest son sat on the end of the strut ( those seeking
further details can contact me directly) or, if you wish, make a
contribution to my son's favorite charity.

    I. also, also had purchased new dust covers and bump stops (if you
don't know what these are, you are up too late and should not be reading
this). Having not a clue how those were to go on as the originals had
disappeared, I finally decided they should be fitted so that the German
inscriptions were right side up.  

    Another small matter that seems to have escaped mention in Haynes or on
the Web is the fact that strut can be installed with the upper mounting
facing two ways, only one of which is correct (Jason, you may recall my
concern that the upper cup was tilting unnaturally).  There is a "detent"
or gap in the little cup or recess where the upper mounting bolt sits. This
should be facing to the outside of the engine compartment as the rubber
bushing is canted to allow for something I am clearly too dumb to fathom. 
Yes, I did have to do one side twice.

    Finally, in spite of what anyone says, there is absolutely no way to
tighten the upper mounting bolts without an air impact wrench  - you can
weld your ass to a farm tractor and you better hope you can get to a
service station.  By the way, I have several uniquely bent wrenches for
sale (sorry, Jason, but, like most Texans, you enjoy making sport with us
easterners).

    I apologize for the length of this message.  I am under heavy sedation,
and the police are on my trail for the unauthorized use of tools at a local
Citgo. But, by the way, my ride is sooooo nice!!
