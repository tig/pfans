Read your post on the $2251 windshield deal. OUCH!! Too much.  If you
have comprehensive coverage your insurance company will replace that
windshield for you at no cost to you.  Not even the deductible.

Before I went down to Florida to pick up the car from Dad, he had a
stone jump up off the pavement from behind an FDOT truck in a
construction zone.  The rock caused a chip that spidered out across the
windshield within a matter of days.  He drove it like that for a week or
two and the put it in storage with the damaged unfixed.  Eighteen months
later I bought it from him and took it out of storage for the drive back
to Ohio.  Shortly after I arrived home, I was checking the car out and
decided that a cracked windshield sucked and wanted it fixed.  Call the
insurance company told them that a rock cracked it and they said, "OK".

Three days later I had a new windshield at NO COST.  Moral to the story
is call your insurance agent.  It should be free.  Hope it works for
you.
