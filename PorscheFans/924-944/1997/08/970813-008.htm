        I'm afraid things aren't looking good for our favorite Auto 
     manufacturer.  First of all I'm just going to hope that this 
     Honda-Porsche-Del-Crappo story is just a hoax.  So we'll ignore 
     (denial) that for a while.  I was shocked to find that you can walk 
     into your Porsche dealer and by ordering the proper options, purchase 
     a Boxster with an MSRP of $63,000.  So much for the affordable 
     Porsche.  The lessons of the fabulous yet unsuccessful 968 are so soon 
     forgotten.  Second, this new 911 looks like it will be a huge 
     disappointment.  The car is obviously an effort for Porsche to cut 
     costs and consolidate assembly lines by building both the Boxter and 
     the 911 on the same platform.  The new car is larger in order to 
     accommodate rear passengers. Which suggests the big fuss over board 
     members wanting a Porsche sedan may have had more effect than the new 
     management wants to admit.  (Proponents of the sedan were reportedly 
     "removed" from the company because these ideas were outside of Porsche 
     "tradition")  The styling on the new car is weak at best, and has 
     received vary lukewarm reviews. Further the adoption of an unproven,  
     water-cooled, boxster-based engine is yet another obvious cost-cutting 
     compromise.  The claim that switching to a water-cooled engine is 
     necessary to achieve desired output gains and to meet noise and 
     emissions requirements seems to be rather suspicious.  You don't have 
     to look very far to find a street legal 500+ hp Porsche engine. And 
     its not like the new 911 gains any power over last year's model.  But 
     I guess the Porsche engineers know a bit more than I do when it comes 
     to engine design.  Nonetheless, I don't see Porsche's future looking 
     very bright, the compromises being made for costs on cars that still 
     remain rather expensive will be obvious to the majority of Porsche's 
     followers.
     
     I've vented enough for now,
     Rod Wiggins
