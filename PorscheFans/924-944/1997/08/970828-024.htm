Hi Jim,

Thanx for the timely response.  I'll try you suggested adjustments but I =
don't know if that will solve the problem. I think I described the =
problem poorly.  The problem is with the curvature of the fender portion =
of the bumper cover being too great on one side.  The seam where it =
mates to the metal fender is aligned OK.  I may have lead you to =
interpret that from my post and if so, I apologize.

The problem is apparent when you look at the car standing in front of =
it.  One side of the bumper cover (fender portion) bulges out more than =
the other.

I'll try some adjustments this weekend and give your suggestion a shot.  =
May even take off the bumper cover belly pan to gain more access to the =
front wheel well ( been there - fasteners galore! )

BTW -  Yeah, I've dealt with that little wheel well access door before =
when I replaced my windshield washer fluid bottle (with one from George =
B.).  Not much room in there.  I finally figured out the thing comes out =
the bottom, not the top.  Oh well, I needed to learn something about the =
disassembling the headlight mechanism anyway!

I can hear my 1/4" drive ratchet clicking already......

Thanx for the advice,

Dean
'87 951 - Hmmmm....maybe we can build a 4-car garage and I can keep the =
Porsche.....

Of the two people who have looked at my '87 951 I have for sale, both of
them have also noted something about the front bumper covers of some of =
the
951s they have seen which is something that also afflicts my car.  One =
side
of the fender portion of the bumper cover sticks-out a little more than
normal.  I have noticed this flaw on several 951s I have seen also. I =
have
also seen 951s with both sides sticking out a little too much.

I'm guessing this may be caused by the polyurethane nose drooping a =
little,
thus causing the fender portion to stick out a bit.  My bumper cover was
replaced with a  used part though....  Anyone else noticed this or =
better
yet - can it be easily fixed?
<

Dean,

Sorry, easily fixed and Porsche do not go together.  The easy fix would =
be
to give it a whack and see if you could align it that way.  Getting to =
the
bolts is a PITA but since you asked.  Pull the wheel and open the access
door in the front of the fender well.  Remove the plastic finger nuts =
from
the running light and remove.  Take a 1/4" drive 10mm universal socket =
and
loosen the bolts holding the urethane nose to the fender.  Align, =
tighten
and reverse the procedure.  There is not much room to work through the
access panel so you probably would be better off removing the plastic
fender liner, I did.

Sorry to hear you are selling your car.  Hope you hang in with the list, =
I
always enjoyed your comments.
