Hey folks!  I have a few questions.  I posted one or two before about
the time the list died so please excuse any repeats.

1).  Want to flush the cooling system on my '89 951.  It was easy on
American cars with a kit from prestone but I don't know of a kit for the
951.  Can I just add some flush to the reservoir and run it for 30
minutes then drain?  Also, I assume with all the aluminium that you must
use a special flush?  When refilling I know that you must use specific
coolant I think Zerex Extreme 450 is one, is there a better one?  My car
does not go much past the 3/4 mark but I plan to add water wetter per
the posts here, any feedback???

2).  The underside of my hood does not have any insulation.  Should a
951 have this?

3).  I am thinking about removing the bottom tray under the engine so
that I can drive up to one of these spray washes and clean the bottom of
the engine/chassis.  Will this hurt anything?  I think I have several
leaks and the tray is catching the evidence.

4).  Will any 8 Valve 944 head fit my turbo?  I suspect that I have bad
valve seals and was going to have the head redone but this is a daily
driver.  I was thinking of getting the head & intake manifold set up
from PowerHaus.  They port & polish & shave the head and extrude hone
the intake runners as well as enlarging them.  Any opinions???

5).  Has anyone put a 6 speed transmission from a 968 into a 951???

Thanks!

P.S. if there is a bunch of x.400 address garbage at the beginning of
this email I apologize.  Microsoft Exchange does some kind of x.400
address resolution before sending.
