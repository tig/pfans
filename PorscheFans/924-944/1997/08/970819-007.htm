Here's an idea, Marv -

Have someone video the session and take notes for the FAQ - I bet your PCA
region could make some money selling copies of the video for a nominal fee
(you would probably have to get permission/release from involved parties),
and I'm sure there are several Pfans who would be interested in the
finished product(s).
