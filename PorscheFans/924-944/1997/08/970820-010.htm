Hi James

Actualy the vehicle that had the lighting mods is my winter vehicle (4 wheel drive pick-up). I coach skiing in the winter so I travel alot in interesting conditions! After seeing the original post I looked for the 55/100 H-4 bulbs and I can't find them any more. I don't belive that the 944 would need any mods to handle the 55/100's. As for the fog light (86 NA) I don't think that upping the wattage will help much do to the lens design. I find that the 55w stock bulbs don't do much.
I do recommend the Hella H-4 headlights, hugh difference over stock halogen bulbs at the same wattage.
Anyone know where to get the 55/100 H-4 bulbs??

Chris White
