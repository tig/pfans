While I generally agree with this post, and totally agree with this
post in regards to 944's w/auto trans, I disagree with the comments
about racing and automatic gearboxes. 

In a 944, the automatic trans is a 3 (ugh) speed. Regardless of how
well the box shifts, in acceleration, a 3 speed will lose to a 5 
speed every day. The Tiptronic is better in that it's a 4 speed,
but that's not as good as a 5 speed.

Regarding racing and automatics, the F1 cars have automatic (well
mostly) automatic gearboxes. The driver shifts my pressing a small
paddle on the steering wheel. One paddle to upshift, one to down-
shift. F1 drivers like the new gearboxes because it allows them
to shift faster, and keep the accelerator floored.

According to 'Racer' magazine, a good driver takes 1 second to complete
a shift. An experienced racer can do it in .5 seconds. The Ferrari
'automatic' can do it in .2 seconds, and will never blow a downshift.

See the light people! The 'Tiptronic' style gearbox is the way of
the future. The article in Racer described how the Ferrari F355
will be available with the automatic gearbox. It really sounds great.
