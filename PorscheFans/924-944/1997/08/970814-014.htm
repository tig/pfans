Has anyone had to replace their evaporator core in a 944?
My A/C recently broke and a local Porsche dealer told me
my condensor was bad and would cost $1000 to fix.  I then
took the car to a reputable Radiator/AC who does a lot of
work on 944's for a second opinion.

Well they told me the condensor was fine and that the A/C
leak was internal to the car and was probably the evaporator
core.  I watched them find the leak .... as soon as they 
placed the probe inside the passenger-side window the detector
went crazy.

Nevertheless, AutoAtlanta told me it could possibly be the
expansion valve vice the evaporator core.  Now I don't know
what to do.  The OEM shop manual doesn't show anything called
an "Evaporator core".  Would this be referred to as the
"Vaporizer"?

I am open for opinions/suggestions and recommendations as to
what I should do.  All I want is the A/C fixed before summer
is gone and not spend a fortune.
