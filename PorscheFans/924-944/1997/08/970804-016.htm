Steve,

I was a radar tech in the Marines, and I find it very unlikely that the unit you
are describing works.  For the most part, radar is a line of site thing.  No
shooting through mountains, and doubtful it would jam through your car while
mounted on the floor like a cell phone.  If it did work, it would have to be
mounted on your dash at least.  In any event, a friend of mine bought one of
those jammers (different brand) for his car.  I was skeptical so called up a
police buddy and went for a 'test'.  The jammer had no effect what so ever on
the police radar, so my friend returned it for his money back.  There are issues
of frequency and signal strength that the police radar takes into consideration
when analyzing the signal return.  Your radar jammer would have to be capable of
jamming X, K, and Ka bands which would require three seperate sets of wave
generation electronics and three seperate sized waveguides with emitting horns.
Police radars aren't a small radar detector sized unit because of the waveguides
and horn necessary to emit a radar signal.  If your device doesn't have this
hardware in it, (how do you squeeze that in a cell phone size?) I'd be
interested in knowing how they manage to emit a doppler wave.  I'm not saying
it's impossible, but if it sounds to good to be true.......
