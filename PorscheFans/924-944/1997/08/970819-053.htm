Gary:

I bought my wife a 92 968 cab with 3k miles on it in May.  The car appeared
perfect throughout, but after I bought it I noticed that the right glove box
restraint piece (plastic) had broken at its junction with the glovebox door.
 The left piece was intact, but without the right piece the door opens too
abruptly and it looked to me like the left piece would break soon.  I tried
to glue the right piece back on with epoxy, but it just broke again right
away.  As an alternative, I bought a piece of plastic-coated braided steel
wire and 2 metal crimping fasteners.  I made a loop in the wire at one end
and crimped it tightly.  I attached the wire under the screw near the opening
of the glovebox on the right.  I then figured out how long the wire needed to
be and cut it, then made another loop and crimped it.  I attached the second
loop under the screw on the right edge of the glovebox door.  I made sure
that the wire, rather than the left-sided plastic piece, would take the force
of the glovebox door opening.

This solution is not very pretty, but it is invisible unless the glovebox is
open.  Even then it doesn't look too bad.  It is very functional.  My dealer
quoted me $1500 for the parts required to fix it professionally.  My solution
cost about 50 cents.

Drop me an e-mail if you have any further questions.
