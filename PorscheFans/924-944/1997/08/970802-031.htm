Yep, another 924 with problems. 
This one is a 1979; I've fixed most of the problems that kept it from
running, but I now have a few others I need some help with.  
Since I first put the car on the road, I've noticed that the brakes
always feel like they need a good bleeding, but I've done this several
times, to no avail.  I think it may require a master cylinder, but I
have heard that the brake system is weak on these cars. When you hit the
brakes, it feels as though they are not applying tightly, and pumping
the brakes does not help a great deal.  If this happened in one of my
vintage Cadillacs, I'd replace the master cylinder, but the brakes on
this car have been this way since my first drive, so I'm not sure.

The other problem is with my idle. As the car is driven, the idle creeps
up.  Eventually it gets to about 2000rpm.  When the car first starts,
and for several minutes later, it does idle at 950rpm.  If I lower the
startup idle anymore, then it stalls on startup.  The car has the
California emmisions package, and I've disconnected the cold start valve
since the end of the winter, as it tends to foul my spark plugs.  I
wouldn't mind the climbing rpm, but it tends to cause overheating during
long idles --- a problem when commuting daily into Atlanta.

Well, these problems seem to be the last ones left on the original
laundry list from 2 and a half years ago.  I just had the doorhinge
welded back on, so the door no longer hangs off, and the recently
replaced starter means no more 'push-starts', so I'm almost ready for
using it as my main car again. I appreciate any help,
