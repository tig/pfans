Hey ya'll,

I've been thinking lately about the cost of ownership of these cars of =
late and have been comparing it's reliability and maintainence costs to =
other cars I own and have owned.  So far, my '87 951 hasn't been all =
that more expensive than my other cars. ('89 CRX Si, '93 Ford F150).

The greatest area of maintainence paranoia that this car generates is in =
the timing belt/water pump area.  Most knowledgeable people recommend =
timing belt, balance shaft belt, and roller replacement every 30-45K =
miles.  This really is not an unusual requirement, given the extra =
complexity of the design.  My Honda, with a super-simple timing belt =
design is recommended for service at 60K miles.  And most Honda dealer's =
will recommend/insist that you replace your water pump with the timing =
belt service.  Maybe the 944 water pump isn't so bad after all.  I've =
noticed that no one ever replaces the idler pulleys when doing timing =
belt services on other makes either, unlike what you get when you =
service the 944.  The original bill to service my 951 timing/balance =
shaft belts was $160 - at the Porsche dealer.  It was $60 to re-tension =
them, for a total service cost of $220.  The Honda will cost you $300 =
(with the water pump).  If you look at the design, you'll see why.  You =
can get to the 944 belts pretty easily.  The Honda is a nightmare.  And =
I'd much rather do a clutch job to my 951 over the Honda.  Front wheel =
drive is not conducive to servicability.  And I HATE torque steer.

Also, don't mistake yourself that the 944 timing belt is the only belt =
that has this super-sensitivity to tension adjustment.  Although my =
Honda has a simple spring loaded tension adjuster, the belt will settle =
and strech and require re-adjustment.  The first time I adjusted my =
valves on the Honda, the belt was *alarmingly* loose.  This is what I =
feel is the cause of most of the timing belt failures - the 'install and =
forget it' mentality of timing belts.  All belts will stretch/settle a =
bit.  I also noticed that the Honda gives a belt tension specification =
(in lbsf/Newtons) for the belt even though the built-in tensioner is =
used.  Porsche is not the only one who specifies a timing belt tension.

I know I keep using the CRX as an example, but most people use Honda as =
the epitome of reliablility.  Honda's are very reliable, but when they =
do require service it is sometimes difficult and the parts are not =
cheap.

Right now my pampered '89 Honda CRX Si is:
1) Leaking water into the rear hatch area from somewhere unknown.
2) On my third Honda muffler.  They rust out about every 3-4 years.
3) Interior has always squeaked from the rear storage area.
4) The shocks are completely shot ( $400 for a set! )
5) Heater control cable mechanism sticking problem (common)
6) Engine hunts at idle (always done it).
7) Ignition switch sticks sometimes causing engine to die after =
starting.

Note though, none of these problems affect overall reliability.  It =
always runs great, never leaks any fluids, and has never let me down.

The services I have performed on my 951 are all normal stuff I would =
expect to do on a 10 year old car ( well, maybe not those damn motor =
mounts).  And original Porsche parts are not that expensive.  Most of =
the more popular stuff is damn cheap.  The 951 goes, stops, and handles =
better than anything I have driven and everybody notices it.  And every =
time I see someone in a new RX-7, Corvette, etc. I smile knowing that I =
saved about $30K and have a better car.  It has been completely =
reliable.  And I got my big-haired woman with it!(had to mention that =
for Jim Richmond).

The real point of my diatribe is this - Even the most reliable cars have =
regular maintainence you have to perform.  If this regular maintainence =
isn't too frequent or too expensive, the car is a good car.  If with =
regular maintainence the car is reliable and satisfies your senses, it =
is a great car.  My CRX is a great car, my 951 is a great car, my F150 =
is a truck.=20

Although all these vehicles have given me minor problems over the years, =
none have left me on the side of the road and that is the greatest =
testament to regular service to a well built vehicle.

Although I am selling my '87 951, I will have one again.  It's still the =
best sportscar out there.  And if it ain't turbocharged, I don't want =
it.
