John,

That was my point to Rich Fletcher.  The Special Edition cars are faster
than the typical 924S with all of the usual conveniences because it is
lighter.  As for the weight difference,  Rich has both a Special Edition
and a usual 924S.  He says he has weighed them and there is about 80lbs
difference.  Finally,  correct me if I'm wrong soneone, the last three
digits of the VIN is the production number.  Your's would be 289.  Mine
is 267.  The 1988 Product Knowledge and Presentation Workbook and the
1988 Dealer Fact Book I have, both indicate that 500 of the Special
Editions were to be produced.  Again, I do not know if this is a
production number or an import number or if more than that were
produced/imported.

I too drive mine on a daily basis.  Most of those I've talked to use
theirs for SCCA Solo II racing.

I am starting a database of the Special Edition cars and their owners.
If you would like to be included, please e-mail me your name, e-mail
address, VIN number, PCA region, number of miles and any other
interesting information about your car,
such as option codes, sunroof, it is used for racing, etc.  I know you
have provided some of this information already.  I hope to create a Web
page with a history of the car and this information sometime in the near
future.
