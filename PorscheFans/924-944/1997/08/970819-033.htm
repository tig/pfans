The TURBO script on the fendor was a dealer installed 'option'

When I was looking for Turbo S's, I saw one that had it. No offense,
but boy was it ugly. It sort of screamed "Look at me, I have a TURBO."
It reminded me of the screaming chicken emblems on certain GM "sports 
cars" of the early 80's. 

The factory manuals give instructions on how to apply the decal.
Too bad they don't tell you how to remove it.

Hope I didn't offend anyone.
