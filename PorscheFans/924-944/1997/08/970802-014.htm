Hi, PFans,

There were several replies to Mike Diamond's post, but I think there may
have been a misunderstanding of the problem.  The same thing is
happening with my car.  The clicking sound is coming from the RIGHT side
of the dash (near the glove box), not the fuse box. I can sometimes
cause the problem by turning the temperature switch past a certain
point.  I seem to remember this being discussed before and I thought I
saved the replies, but I can't find them.  Any ideas?
