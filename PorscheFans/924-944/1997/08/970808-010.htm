Funny you should ask this question.  At the last monthly meeting of the PCA
Potomac region we had a group from Mobile One give a little talk about the
latest developments in synthetic oils.  Despite the marketing pitch there
was some useful information provided about the new 0W oils.

I asked the question about whether or not I should switch to a lower
viscosity oil such as 5W or 0W in my 89 951.  Mobile 1 claims that the lower
weight oils can improve gas mileage and slightly improve horsepower because
the engine does not have to work as hard with the lower weight oils.  The
first question back from the Mobile 1 guy was "What viscosity oil are you
currently using?".  I am using 15W50.  After a few seconds of thought the
response was do NOT switch to the lower viscosity oil.

The lower viscosity oil may have a tendency to get by the bearings and seals
in the turbocharger more easily than the higher viscosity oil.  This will
cause the engine to consume more oil.  It seems the new oils are best for
newer cars.

The Mobile 1 guys also dispelled the myth about breaking in a new engine
with fossil oil instead of synthetic.  The only reason to use a fossil oil
as a break in oil is because it will be cheaper to replace after 1K miles.
Modern engines are made to much tighter tolerances so it will not make a
difference what type of oil is used.  Most newer cars evidently no longer
require a break in oil change.  I know our '97 M3 Sedan no longer requires a
1200 mile inital oil change while our'95 530I did.

I am just repeating what the Mobile 1 guys said.  I am happy with the 15W50
for my Turbo so I am sticking with it.  You may want to try the lower weight
oil and let us know how it goes.
