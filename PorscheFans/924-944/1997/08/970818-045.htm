They had to take out the window? I thought they only had to take out the
back seat for it to be considered a pickup. I know many 924s/944s are sold
over here without back seats, but so are many other cars that haven't a
chance of being ever considered a pickup. Even 911s, I think, were imported
without back seats. As a side note, I have back seats in my 924, but it is
only registered for 3 persons. I guess they took a look at them and figured
they were useless.. :)
