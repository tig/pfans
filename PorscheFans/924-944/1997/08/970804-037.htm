The Cool Carbons were too big. But I guess that's a good thing - more
pad, same money. <g> The brakes do squeal a bit, but the Greens are
better than the Blues and are supposed to be more street-friendly. When
I installed them at the track and I couldn't get the anti-squeal
doojobbers back in, the chief tech god for the region made a comment
about them looking like heat sinks and thought the brakes might run
cooler without them. 

What do you think?
