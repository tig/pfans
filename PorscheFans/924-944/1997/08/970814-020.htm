<<OK, I was trying to figure out a way to determine the frictional force
that tires can exert (don't ask).  I decided to brush up on friction in
general and found something interesting.  My physics book claims that
one
of the empirical laws of friction is that the surface area of the
substance in contact with the other substance doesn't affect the
coefficient of friction (static or kinetic).

I'm having a tough time reconciling this with reality.

Don't people buy wider tires to get better traction?  Like, people who
would know what they're doing (presumably Porsche does)?  If surface
area
doesn't affect the coefficient of friction, then why do wider tires grip
better?>>

The book is correct. The cF does not change dependent on the shape of
the object, but the force to move it does. Take an eraser, stand it on
end, and move it across a table. Now, stand it on it's face and try the
same thing.

If you are really interested in vehicle dynamics I'd recommend "How to
Make Your Car Handle" by Fred Puhn, "Race Car Vehicle Dynamics" by
Milliken et al, or "Tune to Win" by Carroll Smith. The first is the most
basic and the least expensive. The last concerns itself primarily with
formula cars, but I just love Carroll Smith's writing style. RCVD is the
current 'gold reference' on the subject.
