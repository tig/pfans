  My question is, how does one properly remove inspection stickers from 
Sekurit (spelling) coated windshields? Do all 944's have Sekurit? (Story below)

  Yesterday I brought our '86 N/A 944 in for inspection. I went to the dealer 
we purchased the car from thinking they could deal properly with the Sekurit 
coating on the inside of the windshield. I carefully explained how soft the 
coating was, and even had them write the details on the service contract. 
Since they were busy, they gave me a '90 corvette as a loaner so they could 
take their time to do the inspection. This was at lunch, I drove back to work, 
not to bad for a loaner, lots of power, but has bump steering and is not so 
nimble in the handling dept.... At 5:00pm I picked up my wife from home. We 
were going to pick up our 944, and then go out to dinner to celebrate our 2nd 
wedding anniversary. I droped off the keys for the vette with the sales-guy 
and proceeded to the service counter. The service manager tells me he has good 
and bad news. The good news is they are not charging for the inspection and 
the bad news is they aren't going to pass it due to the tint on the side 
windows. I talk with the service manager for a while, and explain we bought 
the car their, and why didn't they tell us about it when they sold the car to 
us,etc.... I finally decide he is not worth dealing with, and my wife and I go 
out to the car to leave.
  I glanced at the windshield and right where the inspection sticker used to 
be is a big yellow gooey mess. Subsequent discussions with the owner of the 
business get us nowhere, they were unwilling to admit to any wrongdoing, and 
refused to take responsibility to fix the mess they created on the windshield. 
The sales guy who sold us the car was kind enough to lend us a dealer plate, 
but insisted on getting it back the next day (today). Needless to say that 
killed the evening.

  This morning I called the local Porsche dealer. The service manager their 
spoke with their mechanics (they wouldn't let me speak with them directly), 
and informed me they had never had to deal with plastic coatings on the 
interior of the windshields. And people wonder why I do all the work on our 
car....

HELP!

Thanks, 
       Ezra
