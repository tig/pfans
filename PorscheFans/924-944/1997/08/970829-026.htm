Hey! I put the Kappa's in my 944. They sound great as long as you have
good power and a subwoofer. I got my Kappas at Executive in NYC. THey
advertise in the back of Car & Driver or Road & Track. I payed about $80
a pair.

Your head unit won't be able to power these speakers. I first used the
35 watt percahnnel Sony CD unit to power them and they were just
starting to work when teh head unit was running out of power. I use a 75
watt per channel 4 channel amp and it works great.

The door installation won't look right with the original grills and the
Infinities don't come with grills. I found a set of Advent grills at the
local car stereo installation shop that work great.

The subwoofer is in a box I designed to fit behind the back seat. Works
good and is easy to remove if you know you will need the space.

I also found an EQ that will fit below the head unit in the dash. It's
made by Pioneer and is their super fancy digital design with all the
bells and whistles. The trick part is that the actual guts to the EQ are
in a remoted mounted box with a 4 foot cord to the control and display
unit. ($299 from Executive)

Send me a note if you need any more info.
