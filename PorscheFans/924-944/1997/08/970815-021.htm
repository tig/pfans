TO: Fellow fans
FR: Rick (87 924S)

Does anybody have a 924 or 924S parts car that would be interested in
selling me the plastic headlight trim for the right or passenger side
headlight.  Looked everywhere and can't find a replacement.

Also, know there was talk previously about dealing with the heat shield
rattling. What was the solution on that one?  Rather than going all
through it again, the date that it was discussed would be helpful.  I
can just look it up in the porschefans archives.

Oh yeah, would also be interested in buying from a parts car the
original (and good condition) door speakers for a 924S.

Thanks to all.  Regards, Rick
.
