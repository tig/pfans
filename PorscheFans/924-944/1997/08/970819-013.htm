Greetings Richard,

It's always nice to see a 931 owner taking care of this rare breed.

Your observation of a rather loud GROWL from the exhaust between 3200 & 3800
rpm is similar to my experiences, except that mine was reverberating at 
around 3000.  I found that the hanger in front of the catalytic converter
had not been used by the previous owner.  It is a real PITA to install.
Re-hanging the entire exhaust system with proper hardware (some custom made)
reduced this noise a bit, but it's still a rather loud car.  If it were not
for the super job of aerodynamic body shaping on this "bullet car", you 
would not be able to hear the exhaust over the wind noise at 3500 in that
long turbo 5th gear.

Regarding top speed on the 931, I could only get to about 125 mph when I first 
bought the car due to a weak wastegate spring and 7 lbs max boost.  A couple 
of years later the cat-conv spontaneously disemboweled itself by shaking the
honeycomb core to bits and blowing them out the exhaust.  The result was a
new top speed of about 130 mph.  This is the US 1980 model and I think I 
remember the factory owners manual saying the top speed was in the 125-130 
range.  Last year I rebuilt the wastegate with a 1-bar (14.5 psi) control
spring and I have no idea what the top speed is now.  I can never get it to
stop climbing before I also chicken out.  I still have that God-awful 85 mph
speedometer we Yanks had to endure for way too long.  I'm making my speed
estimates from the tach and I can say my top speed is now 135+.  I've been 
warned not to run her too long at WOT as the stock aluminum-alloy pistons 
might disembowel themselves and my top speed would, in this case, definitely 
not be increased.  I look at the wastegate mods as an increase in thrust, not 
useful top speed.  Of course, if I spent more time in Germany I'd certainly be 
looking for some higher-grade pistons!
