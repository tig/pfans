P-fans:

I had my car in for service at an experienced independent Porsche mechanic a
month or 2 ago for the first time.  He commented that my 92 968 coupe 6-speed
felt much quicker to him than others he had driven.  He may have been
humoring me to soften the blow of a big repair bill, of course, but my 968
does feel really quick to me.  The car is stock except for a K&N filter and
slight lowering (to Euro height).  I bought it used in December from a
dealer.

My question is, I wonder if the car is chipped.  How would I check this?
 Where is the computer located, how would I get to it, and what should I look
for?

I took the car today to a straight piece of road and dropped the clutch at
about 3500 rpm.  I got wheelspin in first gear, wheelspin in second gear, and
a little even in third gear.  I chickened out at 70 in a 35 zone before
seeing if I could get it in 4th.  I'm sure that guys like Hansman and Farzaan
can do this all day long, but can the other 968s out there do this?  My
wife's 968 tiptronic cabriolet doesn't feel nearly as strong.  My tires, by
the way, are standard sizes (225/50/16 rears).

Thanks in advance.
