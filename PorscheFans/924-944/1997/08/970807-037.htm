Chris -- Couldn't figure out your address, so I'm posting thru the server.
I'm in Laramie WY and have dealt w/ two outfits in ft. Collins --- the
Porsche dealership and Poudre Sports Car. Both are good and can be trusted.
 There are also good outfits in Boulder and Denver.  Can't recall the names
at the moment, but check w/ the Rocky Mt Region PCA for advice. I know some
of these PCA members also run shops dedicated to maintaining and
performance-modifying all types of Porsches.

I'll get you more info of you need it. And think about joining the PCA. The
Rocky Mt Region is a fun group.
