I would be inclined to spend my money on one of those throttle cams that
seem so popular. If you sold your front seats and bought some light
weight buckets the weight saving would give you a better power to weight
ratio. You could, if you felt if it was worth the expense, have the head
polished and ported and a nice lumpy cam fitted. I don't know what the
DME would think of this but it would provide better breathing. If you
were a bit more serious you could have twin Webers with tuned trumpets
and extractors fitted also. I don't know what sort of power you could
make, but a 2ltr SOHC Ford ( sorry about using the F - word guys) can
make 175BHP with the Weber setup.

For a NA car chips do almost nothing. It will change the way the rev
limiter
acts that's about it. Put the 150.00 into a drivers ed event and have
fun
with the car. Put $$ into the tires,your ability and set the car up to
handle better, konis, sway bars ect. You can not make the car "faster"
but
you can make yourself faster.
