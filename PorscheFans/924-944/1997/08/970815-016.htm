The PO of my '89 Turbo had to replace the turbo at 35K miles. The car
has had AutoThority Stage 2 chips since 23K miles and has gone through 2
clutches (26K and 38K miles), a transaxle (62K miles), and a head gasket
(68K miles).

Interesting.  I'd say the clutch and trans are definately due to 
driving style as I own an 89 with orig trans and 2 '87 models
with 122K and 150K miles that have never had the trans serviced.

14K from a clutch tells me someone can't wait till second gear
to step on the gas!

I have put at least 100K on my various 951 models over the years and
the only clutch I had to replace was due to a broken circlip on the T/O
bearing.  I had to rebuild the trans on the '86 bercause I was
a little overzealous ion the shifting department once.  Cured myself
of that one!
