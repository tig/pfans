All you Boosted ones,

I'm having a low boost problem.  My DME went south on me (unless you like
stalling every couple of hours, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes
just not starting).  My old DME had what I think was (and I say was, because
I broke a leg off of it this weekend, which is a COMPLETELY different story)
a Autothority clone.  I put in a used 951 DME w/ stock chip a couple of weeks
ago, it had virtually no noticable impact on performance.  Obviously because
the DME doesn't control boost.  On Thursday, I installed a new muffler
(SuperTrap, sounds KILLER, except for a funny rattle at 2k rpm).  I drove to
work Friday, and late in the day I noticed I was only gettin .8 bar when I
normally got a full 1 bar boost.  I haven't switched back to the other
muffler, It can't be the muffler (can it?).  I had a straight pipe on the
thing which killed my midrange, but I still got full boost.  

How the boost is controled:  Obviously the waste gate.  To increase boost w/
a perf chipset, the Autothority set comes w/ the banjo bolt, Weltmeister the
wastegate shim, and what else methods?  Could my wastegate have been shimmed,
and when I installed the muffler, I knocked it out?

I'm going to attack this situation as follows:  1) guages.  Boost and Oil
Temp.  I was going to order both for JC Whittneys (don't laugh, They weren't
the crappy ones) today, but the boost guage had been discontinued.  Any ideas
on sources for gauges?
2)New rubber everything.  I'm going on a mission to replace everything rubber
in my enginecompartment.  Rubber is doing the "shrinky-dink" thing in most
cases.  I'm particularly concerned that the combonation of all the vacuum
leaks is going to dog pile me soon.
3)Exhaust leak, this maybe should be higher on the list, it might move up
tomorrow when I have a couple of beers with my mechanic.  How big of an
exhaust leek would you have to have to knock you boost down that much?  

Thanks in advance,
Bob Tucker
