Goodafternoon,

I'm trying to shed a clearer light on prices of 944's in The Netherlands =
and Germany. I snooped around magazines, advertisements and showrooms, and =
have to admit that as a non-carsalesman I'm sometimes suprised with the dif=
ferences encountered in selling prices.
For example I saw a '88 944 advertised with 143k kms on it. It was at a =
German official Porsche dealer, came with a 1 year warranty and had price =
of DM 11500 (roughly USD 6325).
On the other hand, you see 1987 models advertised for NLG 22000 (roughly =
USD 11000) and over. Inevitably, some of the difference can be attributed =
to the state the car is in, mileage, accecoires, etc. In general however, =
the differences are quite high.
So, still looking for a smart >1987 944 therefore my question is: does a '=
general' price list exist. Stating that for e.g. a 1987 car one on average =
pays XX, plus XX for metallic paint, plus XX for powerwindows, etc. Is =
there a 'formula' with which one can calculate the loss in value or =
depreciation of the price of a particular Porsche, e.g. 0,75 to 1% each =
month, ot is that putting matters too simple?
Any comments are appreciated.
