The eyebolt was missing from my tool kit also.  The eyebolt is the safest=

way to tow your car onto a flatbed so it is important to have one.

About a year ago the dealer wanted around $50 for the bolt.  I took the
bolt out of the S2 (same) measured it and started my search.  The local
wholesale hardware dealers had nothing close.  One of them told me the
threads were not standard. Did I listen, hell no!  I searched the
industrial catalogs and found what I thought was the part for $12 and
ordered it.  It was close but no cigar.  Called the dealer in defeat and
ordered the part.  The price had changed and it was $26.  I probably spen=
t
$500 worth of my time trying to save a few dollars.  I'll post the part
number when I find my bills.
