When I startup after the car has been siting over night or after being =

parked all day, the oil pressure goes right up to 5 bar at idle.
While driving it goes above 5 bar. After the car warms up it goes to =

normal 2.5-3.5 bar at idle 5 bar while driving. The oil & filter were jus=

see on the stick. I'm in NY/NJ area the outside temp is cool in the AM
(70'sF)
Hot in the PM (80's-90'sF). Water temp is normal between 1 and 2 bars =

during normal driving w/a/c off, just about 2 bars w/a/c on.  Everything

ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Oh yeah it's a 1990 S2 Cabriolet.
