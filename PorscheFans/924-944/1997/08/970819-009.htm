I had a similar problem a few days ago. Engine stopped, but not for a
while - it seemed that it died forever.
Next day I checked cables and I found one totally corroded - the cable
from the reel to the distributor. So i get a new one and tried to start
eng. again. Engine goes on for a few second and after it stopped again.
The problem was unplugged electric cable at the rear fuel pump.

It coud be a similar cheap "eletric" problem. The contact could look ok,
but due the engine/road vibrations may for a while unplugged. Try to
look at the old wires at the eng. and also check if fuel pump is enght.
powered. The prob. could be injection too. That's all I can say.

Or try to girt some dicky cables.

Good luck 

Jindrich
