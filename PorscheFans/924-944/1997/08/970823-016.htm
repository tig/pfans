Charles,

If your Turbo wheels are Phone Dials I recommend the following.
Remove the tires if there are any mounted.
Clean the wheels thoroughly to remove all brake dust, grease, etc.
"Sand" the wheels with a Scotch Brite pad so they are thoroughly scuffed up.
Clean the wheels thoroughly again.
Paint the wheels with Wurth brand aluminum paint.
Spray the wheels with Wurth brand clear lacquer in several THIN coats.
Enjoy new looking wheels that are difficult to distinguish from new wheels.

Wurth brand products - and many others worth using (no pun intended) are sold
under the Griots label by Griot's Garage.  Call 800-345-5789 for a catalog.

I had a bent phone dial and purchased a used wheel from Ernie's Alloys.  This
wheel was straight but the finish was not as nice as my original wheels.  It
now looks nearly identical.  I sprayed my last coat of lacquer on too thick
and got some "puddling" so be sure to spray several LIGHT coats.
