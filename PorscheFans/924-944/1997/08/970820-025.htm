Jeff,
     Thanks for the quick response. I just spoke with PCNA with regards to my 
problem. They told me that no stickers should be affixed to a windshield with 
the soft plastic coatings. This is not the original windshield, it was 
replaced by the previous owner, so Sonnen is probably correct.

  Since the Vermont DMV requires the inspection sticker to be on the center of 
the windshield, I guess I am screwed. I will try various solvents, hopefully I 
can find one that dissolves the sticker gum and not the coating. I will then 
try to place an intermediate layer of clear adhesive plastic for the new 
sticker.

Thanks,
       Ezra
