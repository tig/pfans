Gregor,

Consider the temp. sensors stationed one behind the air vent in the
middle of the dash and one under the hood, at the right side of the car
just in front of the interior-air-intake.
The sensors are of the type NTC-resistors. I have replaced both of them
myself. The one under the hood is 22Kohm, the one in the dash 10Kohm, I
think, at least these are the values I installed and the heater works
just fine.
You can test the sensors by measuring their electrical resistance, and
if you heat them up the resistance must go down.

Since they are easy to check and cheap to replace it may be worth your
while.
