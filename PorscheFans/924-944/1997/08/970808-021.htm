<<I'm thinking that the earlier steel arms might be a reasonable
compromise.
Can someone tell me what is involved in the retrofit (different
bushings,
sway bar mounts, other mods, etc)?

Car is an '88 951.>>

Hi Doug,

I changed my '84 NA from steel to aluminum with no problem. Somewhere
along the 944 line, Porsche lengthened the control arms. I don't know
which one yours is. If you have the short arms the steel arms can be
bolted right on. The bushings are all different and you will lose the
caster adjustment.
 
The steel arms are from the VW Rabbit and I can attest they will
eventually break, particularly with the Weltmeister 28mmm bar. I broke
two while autocrossing and one in an accident before going to the
aluminum ones. I don't know if strengthening them will overcome the
inherent problems, but I have heard rumors that some unknown people have
done so and run them at track events with no problems. So have them
strengthened by welding reinforcement bars into the flanges. 

The major good things about the steel arms are that the ball joints and
bushings are replacable by anybody with mechanical aptitude and the arms
are dirt cheap - free if you know someone with a junkyard. But they are
stamped-steel-mass-produced pieces of crap.

The sway bar attachment point is different and the sway bars are of
different length. The Weltmeiseter bar attaches at the traditional point
on the aluminum arms, but you must drill a hole through the middle of
the steel arms (which is where they eventually fail). The stock mounting
location on the steel arm is at the end where the force of the swaybar
would not put so much pressure on the middle of the arm. I personally
think the combination of unstrengthened steel arms and the Weltmeister
bar should be banned from the track.

My advice would be to sell your other belongings and get the Fabcar
arms. I can empathize since I am going through the same mental struggle,
but the loss of a suspension member at the track can be catastrophic. ;)
