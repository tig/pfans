Have the police in America got nothing better to do than query the
legality of peoples headlight bulbs?

From: Michael G. Wachholz

My U.S. version 968 came stock with 60/55 H4s in the headlamp locations.
 I was surprised to see this as I was under the impression the H4s were
not legal in the U.S.  I have just upgraded the 60/55s to 100/80 and
also upgraded the H3 fogs to 100w and the H1 driving lights to 130w.
The lighting is incredible but I am careful to keep the alignment of the
light correct.  I have also installed euro headlights in my Audi 4000
quattro with 130/90 H4s and 100 H1s and had not had a problem with
anyone flashing their lights at me or law enforcement inquiring as to my
lighting.
