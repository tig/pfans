Hi guys!

Thanks for the fast responses from everyone regarding my hard start
problem.  I replaced the ground cable on my battery and I used a pig
tail to get good block and chassis grounds.  That really seemed to make
the difference, so far so good any way.

Now the next problem.  Someone just the other day was describing
overheating problems with a 968 in traffic, up hill, etc but runs normal
at speed.  I have the exact same problem with my 944.  Today I took
'baby' in to have the radiator flush and filled before I take off outta
here to the classic car show in Steamboat Springs this weekend.  I was
really, really hoping that would be the "fix" but nooooo.  It appears
the thermostat maybe shot as it never opened when they ran the test and
so they did not flush.  Whaaa!  Isn't it fortuitous that I just this
afternoon ordered a thermostat and O ring?  It will be here tomorrow but
who in the world can replace a thermostat in my 944 on Saturday of Labor
Day Weekend?

Anyway, here are my questions.  Since the car doesn't overheat on the
road at speed, would it be ok to take it to Steamboat this weekend? 
(200 miles) Especially if I run the heater full tilt should I run into
any traffic, which is unlikely considering the direction I will be
taking.  But there will be traffic in town when I get there.

Second, can anyone explain to "the blonde" what is involved in replacing
the thermostat in terms of hassle factor, length of time and what a
responsible shop should charge if I provide the part?

Obviously, I'm a little pressed for time here.  I won't be going to
Steamboat until Sunday, so if you could E me with any info "like ASAP"
that would be "like, so way cool"  Thanks.

I'm a blonde, you understand.
