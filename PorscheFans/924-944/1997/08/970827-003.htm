I have a question for the racing experts out there on the subject of
throttle body modifications for the early 924 with K-Jetronic.

I've been looking at buying/making a larger throttle body for this car,
and come up with the following question: would increasing from a
throttle body diameter of, say 20mm to, say, 25mm actually increase the
power output of the engine, or is it another piece like the 944 throttle
cam, changing the response of the engine to a given pedal position. Am I
going to add to the bottom end while sacrificing top end? It doesn't
seem like it, but I want to make sure I'm not making any bad
assumptions.

Also, does anyone out there have a measurement of the throttle body
diameter for the Weber big-bore throttle kit for the 924? It doesn't
look like I can afford to buy one, so I may make myself one. Any
suggestions from any who have gone this route? I'm guessing that, if I
go _too_ large, I'll lose torque from the bottom end, while gaining top
end. Anyone know how large might be too large? Would increasing the
length of the induction system compensate? (I'm also thinking of a
ram-air kit, which would lengthen the intake)

TIA for any advice, suggestions, warnings, etc.
