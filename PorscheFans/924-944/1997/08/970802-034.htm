>about installing an Accusump oil
accumulator:  =


Where is the best place to attach the oil hose?  On the Turbo, one
possibility may be into the lower oil cooler hose but I'm not sure.  Any
help
will be greatly appreciated.<

Ah yes, the Accusump, get ready to spend some bucks on -12 line and
fittings.  I mounted mine in the cavity behind the passenger side front
wheel (remove the plastic wheel well).  You can T into the oil cooler
return line but remember to install the backflow valve on the oil cooler
side.  =


Unless your car has every option known to Porsche, you will find spare
wiring harnesses under the center console cover.  Get the old test light
out and find one that is controlled by the ignition switch.  Your switch
will plug right in.  Splice into the output wire and run a wire through t=
he
firewall located in the passenger side footwell.  There is a gasket that
other wires are already running through.

Place your new switch next to the ignition switch.  Why you ask?  So you
can use the Accusump as a pre oiler.  When you are letting your turbo coo=
l
down before you shut off the key, you flip the Accusump switch to the
closed position.  Before you start your car, you flip the switch to the o=
n
position.  You can watch the oil pressure come up as the Accusump unloads=
=2E

Is it worth all the trouble?  It saved my engine when I blew an oil plug
out of the back of the engine.
