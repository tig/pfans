 Hi, Karl,

Excellent job of reading the wiring diagram... Yes, the ac/heater blower =
fan is indeed controlled
by routing the current through the 4 resistors (and their attendant =
overheating safety contacts).

Replacing the resistor block is not difficult at all. You can find the =
plug and the two Phillips head
screws for the block under that big plastic shroud right at the base of =
the windshield, under the hood.
Be careful with the shroud; the heat and age tend to make them brittle =
and want to crack and crumble=20
in your hands...

Good Luck!

|Hello P-Fans,
|
|I turned on my A/C the other day with the blower speed set on 2 when
|all of a sudden  the blower stopped working.  It worked only when set
|on 4.  After checking the fuse and relay, I decided it was time for the
|manuals.  After  tracing the schematic, I discovered that fan speed 0 =
to 3
|are  controlled via 4 series resistor located on top of the air blower
|assembly and speed 4 bypasses them all together (or shorts them out),
|thus full speed.  I then looked at the electrical connection located on =
top
|of the resistor assembly and found them dirty.  I then cleaned them.  =
Well,
|it worked.   I also know that these high wattage wirewound resistors
|take a beating so I decided to remove the series resistor assembly and
|look inside.  After 10 years of use, they couldn't have looked better, =
but
|they should be replaced.  Some of the resistive material on some of =
them
|are starting to flake off and the contacts inside are tarnished.=20
|
|Now  the real reason for this thread. Has anybody ever replaced this
|assembly?   It doesn't look all that easy and the manuals don't say
|anything about it.  In-fact it looks like one long connection from the =
control
|knob INSIDE to the air blower OUTSIDE via a rubber grommet.  The
|thought of having to go under the dash is not exciting at all.  In =
fact, I'm
|thinking that when they do go bad for good, I'll cut and solder  new =
ones
|in leiu of spending hours under the dash.
|
|Any suggestions or advise would be very much appreciated.
