First, take a look at the 944 FAQ at
http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html, or a slightly older, text
only version at http://www.mindspring.com/~ccumming/944.faq.  This will
give you an idea of the updates that came with the later cars.  The major
update was in the 1985.5 and later cars, with the streamlined dash
redesign, heating and ventilation, and driver seating position.  However,
this is not a must, as many folks on this list will attest.  Many prefer 
the 924 style gauges (love that tachometer!).

Briefly, high wear or failure prone areas include:

 Water pump

 Cooling system (if neglected).

 Timing/balance shaft belts

(again, only if neglected and not tensioned/replaced at the recommended
intervals with the factory tension gauge) The proper belt tension can only
accomplished with the gauge.  They can't be done 'by feel' as with the 924
and Golfs/Rabbits.  Some claim to be able to do it, but the tension will
never be correct when checked with the gauge.  Improper tension will cause
rapid water pump and belt wear or risk of a jumped tooth (loss of valve
timing). 

 motor mounts

 Lower control arms (ball joints)

 Leaky power steering

 Oil cooler seal failure (see FAQ for details)

 Cracked exhaust manifold (old 'bellowed' style)

 Clutch

(clutch wears well, but rubber center (replaces the internal springs on a
conventional design) can disintegrate and cause the clutch disk to bang
against its stops, as well as rubber chunks getting stuck in the assembly
and causing all sorts of problems.  Clutch master/slave cylinder can leak. 
Clutch fork can wear/bend with age. 

 Power sunroof mechanism

Transmission, if abused.

Get service records with the car, or it had better be cheap!  At a
minimum, have a Porsche mechanic look it over, and replace the
timing/balance shaft belts if there is no documentation to show they were
replaced within the past 30,000 miles.  I would just replace them anyway
for peace of mind.  A cam belt failure will cause valve collisions with
the pistons, and you will be in for a $3000+ repair.

Otherwise the car can be a very reliable daily driver, with all the 
Porsche wonderfulness.  However, purchasing a car in poor or neglected 
condition can require repairs up to and even exceeding the original cost 
of the car to bring it to proper operating condition.

Typical parts and labor estimates for major repairs (West coast, USA)

Water pump $1000

Clutch $1500 - $2500 (turbo is more)

Control arms $300 - $600 depending on whether parts are new or used

Valve job $3000+

Otherwise the car is quite durable, and the engines bulletproof.  Well 
cared for, 944's can exceed 250,000 miles before needing major work.
