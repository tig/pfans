Just a quick question about the splash pan, or windage tray, or whatever
it is that it's called. It's the one that bolts to the sheetmetal below
the radiator and extends under the oil pan. My car hasn't had one since
I bought it some 7 months ago, and I haven't seen any strange things
happen, but I figured the factory put it there for a reason. Does anyone
know if it serves any purpose other than as a debris-catcher?

My second question concerns the heater valve location. I guess I started
saving some of the great advice on this list too late, because I know
someone posted a method to relocate the valve to a location other than
on top of the clutch. Mine's started leaking ever-so-slightly, so I
figure it would be smart to move it when I replace it. If anyone can
point me in the right direction in the archives or remembers the item,
I'd appreciate it.

TIA
