These are the 968 M030 items, they were not part of the Turbo S suspension.

Same thing here???

The name "Turbo Cup" is beginning to be used quite a bit in advertising.
Remember, this series was run 10 years ago and there may be other items
available for you car that are as good if not better. Rules stated that
certain items be used, example: swaybars, stock torsion bars with helper
springs, etc.  There may be items that can now be used within our "rules"
that will perform better.
