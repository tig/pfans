I will probably be taking off my exhaust manifold in the next couple of
weeks.  The only tricky part looks like the four bolts on the turbo
(particularly the 2 I can't even see!!)

Does anyone have anys suggestions about the best angle to attack these
fasteners at?

Bob,

Low yield nuclear explosion, it still will not come off but then you can
tell your insurance company to buy you another turbo that doesn't need th=
e
crossover pipe removed.

Buy two throw-a-way 15mm box end dog leg wrenches.  Harbor Freight carrie=
s
the cheapo kind out here.   Grind down the box end so it will fit over th=
e
nut.  Then take your torch and heat and bend the wrench so it will look
like a broken dog leg.  Depending on the length, you may have to chop off=

the end of the wrench.  Grind down the non box end so you can get a 6-8
inch small diameter cheater bar on it.  Grind down the box end of the oth=
er
wrench and cut a bolt width slot in it so it looks like a flare nut wrenc=
h.
 Cut down this wrench so it is about 3 inches long (stubby).  You break t=
he
nuts loose with the first wrench and take them off with the second.  If y=
ou
do not slot the second wrench you will trap it on one of the studs as you=

back off the nut.  With the slot the second wrench is not strong enough t=
o
break loose or reinstall the nuts so you need the first wrench also.

Do not worry about your wrench fabrication time because you have to
reinstall the pipe after you take it off. Time spent on making tools will=

save time and frustration later.  If you are really one of the blessed, y=
ou
may have to take it off again, I know.

Remember it is the journey, not the destination.

Turbo nuts for everyone

If you can get the car on a lift , it makes it easier to get out a full
volume scream of frustration.  Our pals at Porsche must of burned the
midnight oil to design this nightmare.

Talk to Chris Halon about the joys of turbo pipe removal.
