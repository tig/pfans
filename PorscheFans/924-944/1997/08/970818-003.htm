Hi all,

Just got back from my holiday in Germany, took my 931 (just finished 
engine, turbo and clutch rebuild) as I thought it would be a nice 
run-in trip for it. All went fine but I now have a few questions.

a) There is a rather nice GROWL from the exhaust between 3,200 & 3800
   rpm. This is fine for short trips (rather nice really) but after
   a 800 mile trip starts to really get to you. Is there anything I
   can do about this. (apart from buying ear defenders) The exhaust
   is stock as far as I can tell, and is very securely fastened to
   the car.

b) Does anyone know the top speed of a UK 931 (late 81) model. I took 
   mine up to 135 mph and chickened out. All the money I had spent
   rebuilding the car flashed before my eyes.

c) Due to this hot weather we are having in Europe at the moment, I
   think I might have a problem with the cold start system. In the
   morning it starts first time, run it for while and leave the car
   standing for 1 and a half hours and it will fire first time and
   then die and refuse to start again. Leave it for about a minute
   and it starts fine. Any ideas???

The 931 is now back in the garage for a check up and oil change, ready for
the next stage of the rebuild.

Thanks for any comments,


Richard.
