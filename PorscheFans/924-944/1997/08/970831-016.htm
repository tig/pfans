Hi!
 I am in search of a non-aspirated 944, preferably 88-89, but 87 would be
okay too. It must have manual trans, and I'd like it to have AC and
sunroof; yet most importantly I'd like to buy a car from a dedicated
Porsche owner who has taken care of it and treated it well! I live in the
San Francisco area and my father lives in Seattle, so a car in the =
western
half of the country is preferable...however if I can find an 89 that's in
excellent condition for a good price I'd be willing to overlook the
distance factor:) If anybody is thinking of selling their car (I'd really
like to buy one from somebody on the list) or knows of somebody who is
selling a car I'd be interested! The car does not necessarily have to be
ready for sale immediately so that is not a problem.  Thanks a bunch!

Aaron Pultz (I'm using my father Tom's e-mail in case anybody recognizes
his address:)
