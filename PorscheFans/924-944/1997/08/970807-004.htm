Whether or not you buy this car depends on its intended purpose.  This could
be a great deal if you want to track the car on a regular basis.  Some
people will tell you to run away from it because it has been tracked.  Your
insurance company may not insure it because it has been set up for the track
(if they find out that is).  I assume it is still street legal.  The small
crease will may cost $1K to fix depending on how bad it is.  You have at
least $1k worth of go fast stuff done to the car.  I consider it a wash.

How about records of other repairs?  By 70K miles it probably has a new
clutch, waterpump, motor mounts and belts done twice.  $14.5K is a good
price for a relatively low mileage, well maintained 89 951 in good shape.
Since the previous owner is a PCA instructor, I assume the car was well
maintained.  You can find other 951s cheaper, but with the chip you will not
find many any faster.  I would say this is a good buy if it is in good shape
and you plan to use it as a toy and not for everyday driving.
