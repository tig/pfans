Here's another solution, Pfans, taking the "cord" idea one step further:
Use some stranded, insulated electrical wire (available in a lot of
different colors) with ring terminals crimped onto the ends.  The ring
terminals can then be attached to the screws on both the lid and wall of
the glovebox.  I happen to be in the electrical business, so this is the
solution I came up with (and it didn't cost me anything, as I had all of
the materials either in my garage or at work - and, I bet most of you do,
too).  Happy Crimping!!!
