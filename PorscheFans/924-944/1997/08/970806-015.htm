This is quite wrong.  The body on the E30 M3 is VERY much different from
the 325 sedan.  It has the obviously flared fenders, different ground
effects, and the body is totally different from the front doors back.  The
rear window was made more horizontal making the car more aerodynamic.  The
suspension is totally different, the engine is totally different, etc...
It is a MUCH bigger difference than the 944/951 difference.

Drive one before you pass judgement.  I cannot see how you could call it
anything but a sports car.  Actually, you are the first person I have ever
heard say this...  I consider it every bit the sports car that the 944 or
911 is!  The E30 M3 is lighter than a 944, has a better or equal power to
weight ratio (if you bring in the 951 I will bring in the EVO M3s), much
better racing history, has the same number of seats, etc..So what makes one
a sports car (or quasi-sportscar) and one not?!?

Uh, the only M3 sedan is the brand-new model.  The E30 M3 was never made in
a sedan (but a convertible was made.)

I can see you point if we were talking about the M5, but still it has to be
considered a sportscar, or atleast a sports sedan.  These cars raced
against Lotus Esprits, ZR1s, etc in touring class racing....and WON two
years in a row.  Not too bad for a sedan.

Sure this is what is typically called a "British sportscar".  By these
rules, a 911, 944, 951, M3, Z28, etc are not sportscars....  Well, you can
have your own rules, but it is definitely a sports car...

The E30 M3 was a purpose built sports car!  It only had won goal- To win
races!  And win it did.  It is still the winningest car in touring class
racing EVER.

The E36 M3 is much less of a substitute for the E30 M3.  IMHO, it is more
similar to the M6 (another fine GT car.)

A 944 is no more of a sportscar than an E30 M3.  How do you make these
rules???  The 944 has a back seat, so by your rules, it CANNOT be a sports
car.  I realize there are gray areas of what is, and isn't a sports car,
but I think your rules are illogical.

I guess, in the end, it doesn't make a difference if you consider the E30
M3 a sports car.  Call it what you want, but it was purpose built for the
track, and it dominated the late-'80s when it got there (to the track).
