Subject: Tire Balance Question

Hello all,

I have a Tire Balance question.

I have a 1988 951.
My steering wheel seems to shake at the 60-70 mph range.
But only SOME of the time.
It has been doing this for a while.

I suspected wheel balance. But I do not understand why it comes and goes.

I have installed 4 new tires and new front rotors.
225/50-16 on 7x16 original Porsche rims on the front
245/45-16 on 8x16 original Porsche rims on the front
The suspension has been checked and all 4 wheels have been aligned.

Recently, I also had the following fixed:
A-arm replaced, CV boot replaced, and a repacked front spindle bearing.
So there should not be any major problems with the suspension.

Even with all of these changes, I have the same steering wheel shake that I
had before any of the above was performed. Old tires, new tires, no
difference.

I had the new tires rebalanced at a different shop but still, the problem
persists.

I have been told that I should have the tires balanced while they are on the
car with some type of strobe but I am having difficulty finding anyone who
can do this procedure in the Dayton, OH area.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Thomas Bapu
