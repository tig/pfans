 The 944 Pick Ups were very real in Norway for a while in the 80s. Given
the Scandinavian countries extremely
  high taxes on cars (100 - 200%) Porsches were an impossible dream for
most people. However, under these laws
  Pick Ups are exempt from most of these taxes. This loop hole prompted
a large amount of Norwegians to drive to
  Germany, buy a used 944 and take out the rear window. Legally, the car
was now considdered a pick-up and was
  hence much cheaper to import. The hole was propped shortly after, but
as far as I know, quite a few 944s made it
  into norway this way. 


  As a side note, I know that several Mercedes cars are professionally
converted into pick ups in Denmark for the
  same reason.
