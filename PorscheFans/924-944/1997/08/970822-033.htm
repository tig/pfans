Hi All,

I hope someone can help me with regard to Baby carrying and a 968CS. I 
wonder if anyone is using a baby seat for their car that fits in to the 
rear seat position. Currently the Safe& Sound :) version I have for my 
wife's car doesn't fit. I could use the front passenger seat, however 
this turns the car into a two seater. 

My local dealer was astonished that I would even want to carry a child in 
the car!!
I mean if you were a child off to play group, wouldn't you want to arrive 
in a proper car.

Any baby carrying experiences would be gladly accepted, as it is due to 
arrive in October.

Regards

Glenn Davis

( Baby Seat but wondering were to put it!!)
