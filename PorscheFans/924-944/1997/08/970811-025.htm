Hello, first of all, I would like to thank all of you that took the time to
respond to my last post. I was able to fix what I thought was a$1000 a/c
system failure for $.85 and about 45 minutes work. The a/c is bl;owing great
now. 
The reason for this post, is as I said before, I have a 1987 944s. I really
love the car ( now thta it is running ) and I feel this sudden urge to spens
some money. I am in the car for around $1000 ( after I recieved the check
from the mechanic I had to sue for damages they did. I plan to spend around
$2000 on a paint job, and I would like to do some work on the exhaust and
suspension.  There is nothing wrong with the Bilstein shocks on the car now,
should I wait ? Or is there a big improvement with a different shock/strut?
Secondly, I have looked into a new exhaust. The oem system runs around $800.
The reason is there is a second small resonator near the catalytic converter.
The standard 944 muffler does not have this.  Can the system just be
exhanged, or is there some real reason for this difference? Secondly, what
type of aftermarket performance muffler would work well? I have found that
Anza and Bosal do not make a muffler for this car. Any advise would be
great!!
Thank you,
