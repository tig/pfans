Marv,

What we did a while back before the locals got crazy and went to Laser guns 
was to transmit back an ever increasing speed (higher and higher freq.). So 
that the gun would assume that the target was going faster. What you say 
why go faster ?

Answer is easy:

1. the Gun will lock on the highest rate it finds, so it you have already 
been tagged at 90 mph sending out a 35 will be disregarded so faster is the 
only way to go.

2. When the cop tries to hand you a ticket for 180 mph, you always offer to 
take it. "Wow that exceeded the max speed for this car by 20 mph, the guys 
will love this!" followed by well we know you were speeding so we will give 
you a ticket for xx, then you say no way either the reading on the meter or 
nothing.

3. The cops know you are blasting them, but the only choices are  to;

a. search the car and hope to find a black box.
b. Give you the ticket which will get thrown out in court
c. Wave you on, but with an eye on you.

Not that I would ever do this ;-}

Bill,

Emission of a doppler signal is easy, if you think of it in the form that
we are all familiar with, sound, where the pitch of the engine of an
oncoming Porsche appears to change as it passes us.  The frequency is the
pitch and for a stationary observer a 1 kHz tone sounds just like you would
expect.  If the observer is moving in relation to the object emitting the
sound the pitch changes relative to the observers motion.  That is, higher
frequency when advancing toward the source, and lower when retreating.  The
reason is that the sound, or wave, doesn't get there faster or slower, but
the distances between the wave crests (components that make up frequency)
are either compressed or expanded.  In dry air, at sea level, the speed of
sound is a constant, just like the speed of light.  Since the frequency of
sound, or radar, is nothing more than physical length between wave crests,
like ripples on a pond, plowing through them at speed only allows you to
intercept them faster.  The speed that the wave propagates changes not.

Take that to the level of the police radar gun and if you imagine the radar
wave rippling out on a pond, any vessel moving toward the source will
reflect the waves back and those waves will be closer together (crest to
crest distance) dependent on the vessels velocity.

When one of our esteem officers of the law points a radar gun at your
speeding nose, that signal, at a specific frequency, is bounced off the car
and returned to the source.  If the target is stationary, the returning
frequency is the same.  If it is moving, the velocity is either added or
subtracted, depending if the vehicle is moving toward or away from the
radar gun.  The frequency of the return wave is either slightly higher, as
is the case when the target is moving toward the gun, and lower if
retreating.

So, just change the frequency of the return signal...

Now the tricky part.  To defeat this principle you need to receive the
signal and then return it at the original frequency plus some value that
equates to your desired speed.  You devil you.

Problem number one is the interception of the signal is at speed and you
will receive the signal at a higher frequency than what it actually is.
This means you need to know what your forward velocity is, subtract that
from the received frequency to get the real send frequency, then add a
return pulse at the desired frequency, but wait, there is more.  You are
already moving forward and even if you send a return pulse at the corrected
base frequency, plus the speed you want to appear to be going you will be
making a gross error.  You need to subtract once again your forward
velocity.  Any pulses emitted from a moving object will  (otherwise you
will appear to be going faster than you are actually going in the eyes of
the officer - we do not want a 200 mph speeding ticket when we were doing
an honest 100 mph).  A simple microcomputer connected to your speedometer
works fine.

Problem number two.  Let's assume that you now have correctly adjusted the
frequency and are about to return it to the source at the base frequency
plus, let's say 35 mph sounds nice and respectful, you need to over whelm
the existing return pulse that bounced off of your car going at 110 mph.
Fortunately, your radar profile is small enough that not much of the signal
is returned, but you need to transmit enough of a signal to exceed the
return pulse plus what ever discrimination level that radar gun has in its
receiver.  If the return pulse does not have enough signal strength, your
gallant efforts will be lost.  To this end I would agree that the jamming
device would need a good antenna in the form of a horn to provide insurance
that you could deliver enough signal to overwhelm the return pulse.

Problem number three.  Well Uncle Charlie, from the FCC, has a few
diplomatic things to say about transmission of radio frequency.  The FCC,
bound by international laws as well, has put a limit of 100 mW for
transmitters under Part 15.  There is also an antenna limit as well.  As a
third gotchya, there is a law about ERP (Effective Radiated Power) so they
cover their butts well.  Even if a radar jammer were able to operate under
Part 15, the amount of power would likely be insufficient to overcome
police radar.  The reason is radio emissions at those high frequency are
very, very directional.  If you are lucky enough to be pointing your
antenna at exactly the right spot, then maybe you would pack enough punch
to over ride your echo.  However, since the actual direction is unknown,
you need a more omni directional antenna.  As you may be aware, just like a
reflector concentrates the light of your flash light, a bare bulb is very
dim.  So would be an antenna that was pointing everywhere.  You can
overcome this with lots of power, much more than 100 mW.  Bottom line, it
will not work, with one exception.  Under the unusual condition that the
officer holding the gun was stuck to your front bumper, you could have
complete assurance that whatever speed you are traveling, his gun would
read 0 mph (assuming that you were still unable to jam it) as the two
velocities (car and gun) are now equal.

And that is what little I know about doppler radar guns.  QED.
