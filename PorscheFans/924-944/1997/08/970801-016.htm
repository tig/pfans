LED's are rated for maximum current, forward voltage drop will vary between 
types and batches of LEDs. For a given power supply voltage (Vdd), desired 
current draw (Imax), and forward voltage drop (Vf), the following formula can 
be used to determine the required series resistance to limit current:
R=(Vdd-Vf)/Imax (This is Ohms Law, V=IR ->> R=V/I)

For example, if you have two leds in series with 1.7v drop across each LED, 
and a blinker circuit that outputs 13v max, and a max current rating for the 
LEDs of 10mA:
R=(13v-2*1.7v)/0.01A = 960ohms =~ 1Kohms

      D1       D2  
      |\       |\       R=1K
 Vdd__| \|__ __| \|__/\/\/\/\__GND
      | /|     | /|            
      |/       |/ 

A simple ckt can be made with a 555 timer IC to provide the desired blink, 
with all parts available from radio shack. There are many ckts that can be 
made to provide the blinking. Perhaps the simplest to create would incorporate 
a blinking LED (it has a small chip within the LED to provide the blink). I 
can prototype such a ckt, and give the details to the list if anyone is 
interested. Or, you could replace the LED's in the door handles with blinking 
LED's, and power appropriately.
Good Luck,
          Ezra
