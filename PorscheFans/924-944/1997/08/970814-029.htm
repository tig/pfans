Paul,
Last winter I replaced all of my engine seals, including the oil pan gasket, 
on my '87 944 engine. As such, my engine was also empty of oil when I first 
cranked it. I used assembly lube where I could. I also filled as much of the 
oil system as possible by using a funnel and plastic tubing to fill from the 
oil filter mount. Despite all of this, it took actual running of the engine to 
build up oil pressure (several seconds). See my post on April 29th of this 
year for a description of my experience (search for the subject "Leakdown Test 
Advice, and other questions"). Since I did not receive any responses to my 
post, I can't say if this is normal or not.
Good Luck!
          Ezra
