I'm very sorry, but I couldn't resist. It does have Porsche content, and
I'm sure many of you have heard this before. So again many apologies.....

 A hobo comes up to the front door of a neat looking farmhouse and raps
gently on the door. When the owner answers, the hobo asks him,  "Please,
sir, could you give me something to eat?  I haven't had a good meal in
several days."

The owner says, "I have made a fortune in my lifetime by supplying goods
for people.  I've never given anything away for nothing.  However, if 
you go around the back, you will see a gallon of paint  and a clean paint
brush.  If you will paint my porch, I will give you  a good  meal."

So the hobo goes around back and a while later he again knocks on the
door.  The owner says, "Finished already? Good. Come on in. Sit down. 
The cook will bring your meal right in."  The hobo says, "Thank   you
very much, sir.  But there's something that I think you should know. 
It's not a Porsche.  It's a BMW."
