I test drove a 1991 Guard's Red 944S2 this past weekend and left somewhat
dissapointed.  The entire front of the car was faded and the engine was
not "eager" to rev.  Both my old S(running on Mobil 1) and even the Ts
that I test have driven seem to be very willing to increase their engine
speed, whether they had a gear engaged in the gearbox or in neutral.  I do
understand that the S2 has a 3.0l as compared to the 2.5l of the S or the
T, but still should it make that big of a difference?  The car has
62kmiles on it and was maintained by one of the local dealers who uses
20w-50 Pennzoil.  Could the oil be the reason the car did not feel as
smooth and willing to rev?  I am very confused and would appreciate some
feedback from other S2 owners.  

BTW, doesn't Porsche have an extensive warranty on the paint?  Given the
car is still under warranty, should it not be possible to have Porsche
repaint it?  I will call Porsche on this, but I am also curious on what
experiences fellow P-fans may have had.

TIA.
