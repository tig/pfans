There seems to be a lack of consensus on this server regarding the =
normal
operation of cooling fans, so I'll take this to see what PFolks think. A
switch to control the fans is not necessary if the rest of the circuit =
is
working correctly.  According to the Tech. Info. manual for the late =
'85,
when the switches in the rad. temp. sensor were changed, both fans work =
in
concert, operating at 2 speeds, and activated by the temp. switch and =
A/C.=20
Both fans should come on after as hot track run, assuming the temp. =
switch
is working.  If not, the turning on the A/C should turn on both fans. =20

After reading several discussion items on the fan operations and calling =
half of the parts suppliers on my list, I finally got a copy of the =
original Factory service information for the 85.5 944's. Here's what it =
says;

"Cars with air conditioning have two fans. Both fans are operated via =
relay G 17 by a 3-pin double thermo switch inserted in the radiator.

With the air conditioner turned on both fans run at speed 1 (approx. 8 V =
power supply via 0.9 ohm ballast resistor). If the air conditioner is =


not turned on, both fans are switched on automatically to speed 1 when =
the coolant reaches a temperature of 92 deg C (200 deg F) (switching off =
temperature : 87 deg C) (190 deg F)

When the coolant temperature reaches 102 deg C (215 deg F) the fans are =
switched to speed 2 ( approx. 12 V power supply). The temperature for =
switching back to speed 1 is approx. 97 deg C (205 deg F)

Both fans could also be switched to speed 2 with the refrigerant =
temperature switch, if the temperature of the refrigerant reaches 52 deg =
C (125 deg F).

The coolant temperature sensor in the cylinder head of cars with an air =
conditioner has an additional temperature switch. The sensor part =
(terminal G) controls the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster. =
The temperature switch (terminal W) closes at a coolant temperature of =
115 deg C (240 deg F), turns on a warning lamp and activates the a/c =
relay G17 on the central electric board. This switches off the a/c =
compressor to avoid excessive thermal loads."

For what it's worth, my fans don't exactly operate like this. One fan =
(only) comes on at approx. 92 deg C , and both fans come on in speed 2 =
at approx 102 deg C. They shift back to one at speed one somewhere =
around 85 deg C. Never had a problem with it trying to overheat, so I've =
left it alone.

Thought it might help.
