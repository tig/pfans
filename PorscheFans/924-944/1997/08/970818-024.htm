The following situation has developed on a stock 1984 N. A. 944.

My wife has begun driving track events with this car and has experienced
difficulty heel & toeing.  A friend who's a long time 944 racer said "
Simple, I'll just pull the gas pedal over a bit."  He did and the alignment
of the pedals is much nicer.  Apparently he bent the trottle rod abit
pulling the gas pedal to the left.  He did this in the middle of a one day
track event and when Donna went back out she came right in and said
something is wrong with the throttle, "it's like the pedal is falling away!"

We opened the hood (racing friend had taken off by now) and notice that the
cable was nearly falling off the throttle cam.  There was way too much slack
in the throttle cable.  So with a couple of wrenches we tightened the
tension.  In doing this we introduced much more bend in the cable assembly
within the engine compartment.

Donna says the car is still doing the same thing and she doesn't like it.  I
drove it (it used to be my car) and what I think she's feeling is that the
spring tension on the pedal seems to suddenly become less.  The original,
stiffer tension is as before but suddenly the pedal is easier to push. This
happens pretty much at the same position but not every time the pedal is
depressed. 

I'm thinking that the bend we introduced in the cable, adjusting the
tension, might cause that sudden change.  She took the car to the local
dealer and they say that they need to replace the now bent throttle rod
($195).  I'm thinking that it might be possible to shorten the cable?  Donna
now tells me that the cable was very loose on the cam even before the pedal
was moved over; so loose that she was worried about it coming off.  Do
throttle cables stretch???   We should have just bought some pedal extenders!

Does anyone have any thoughts?
