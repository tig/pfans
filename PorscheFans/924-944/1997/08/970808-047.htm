        my two cents regarding the value, reliability, ownership of
water-cooled porsches:

        i'm twenty-five years old and just graduated from engineering school
last year.  due to a myriad of factors i didn't my license (no, not SCCA, or
PCA Club Racing, just driver's) until last fall and then started looking for
a car.  to make a long story short, i benefited directly from the low resale
value of these cars and essentially ended up buying a ten-year old porsche
because i couldn't afford a five-year old honda or toyota.  i feel fortunate
to have had the market forces on my side.  note well: an '88 mustang gt with
less than 80 k mi in good condition cannot be had for less than $7500.
        
        on march 22, i bought an '87 924S with 76k mi for $3350 from a
second owner who sank almost twice that into the car in the four years he
owned it.  i was very impressed by the PO and (foolishly) decided to forego
a pre-purchase inspection.  the day after the transfer i (even more
foolishly) drove to new york and suddenly found myself on the bowery with
huge clouds of (smoke !!??) steam rolling out from under the hood.  luckily
it was only a broken fan switch and i've become quite the gauge-watcher
since.  i've had good luck since then.

        i was fully aware when i bought the car that maintenance expenses
would be frequent and high and that very little of the initial investment
would ever be recovered.  i expected good handling, dependable torque in an
all-around solidly designed car and that's exactly what i got.  these are
probably the best "personal" "driver's" cars ever produced.  i plan to put
at least 100 k mi on this car before its retirement (that will probably be a
leisurely drive to ulster park in the beautiful upper hudson valley).
i am on pace to drive 24,000 mi in my first year of ownership.

        my reccommendations to all those considering the first-time purchase
of a 944/924S (redundant, but worth repeating ad nauseam):

1)  schedule a pre-purchase inspection at a p-dealer or reputable p-shop.
2)  schedule a belt replacement and water pump update (if applicable)
3)  if your car has no airbags, put in a momo monte-carlo (or similar)
wheel.  i can't adequately express how big an impact this had on the     way
the car feels.  what an improvement over the godawful 380mm VW/Audi
    steering wheel in the 924S/early 944.

        on 924S ownership:  this arguably the most humble, understated car
ever produced by porsche.  especially in zermattsilber.  i do occasionally
suffer from fender-flare and forced-induction envy but i enjoy the hell out
of driving my nimble car.  911 drivers do not acknowledge me, but neither do
potential thieves or vandals.  i park her on the street in lower manhattan
all the time and have never had a problem.  i once enjoyed hearing a
passerby mutter "check out the pca sticker on that mazda"

        i think we all know that these are terrific for driving, not
investing.  i use my p-car as a daily driver and make long trips on
weekends, but i enjoy every mile.  the fact that i'm driving a porsche makes
every trip not just less arduous, or neutral but a positive, joyful
experience that i always look forward to.  i'm going to continue to rack up
the miles and maintain my prayer schedule:

        dawn: face gmuend
        noon: face zuffenhausen
        dusk: face weissach
        midnight: face pfaffenhausen      :)
