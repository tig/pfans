Stopped by the Porsche dealer this morning.  Claims agent hadn't been there
yet.  Got some disheartening information, however.  Apparently, under
Illinois law, any vehicle claiming flood damage is automatically considered
"totalled" if the water level reaches the bottom of the dash, and if you
remember from my original post, it was observed that the water level had
reached "at the least" the windows on the outside.  The dealer confirmed
this morning that the water level on the inside had indeed reached, at a
minimum, the bottom of the dash.  Now, it is still possible that the
insurance company might take into consideration that our dashes are
extremely low in the vehicle, so keep your fingers crossed.  If they do
total it, and if I can possibly buy it back cheaply enough, it would have
to be re-titled with a new vehicle i.d. number.  But, at least, if I am the
continuing owner, I will be able to prove its original lineage.  I might
have more information this afternoon, and if so, will let you know.
