The Turbo is no more troublesome than the other cars but given that it does
have a turbo there is some exposure there for expensive repair. In general
the turbo is a very reliable component.

There is a significant performance difference between the turbo and the S.

The best way to make sure you aren't buying a problem is to have the car
checked by a quality mechanic who is very familiar with the cars. You can
quite easily spend several thousand dollars making a bad copy right if you
have to pay someone to work on the car. Getting a good copy of either a
Turbo or S is much more important than any model-specific reliability issues,
either real or imagined.

Good luck with your purchase plans,

Doug
