Said sensor is located, almost, directly below the heater valve that 
resides (leaks) at the back of the engine.  There are two.  The pair are 
removed with a retaining bolt on the top of the bell housing.  They are 
nothing more than Hall effect sensors, but I do not know how to test.

George Beuselinck can give you details on this and they need to be set to 
a specific height to function properly.
