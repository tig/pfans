Hi all:

Belts and water pump have been replaced 30,000 miles ago.  The shop that did
the work does not recommend replacement yet.  Another well known race/repair
shop owner recommends another 15,000 miles on the existing parts.  Otherwise,
I have seen and heard many recommendations for replacemet at 30K.

So . . . it is better to replace them prematurely than to experience a
failure.  I have ordered the belt tension tool and one of the list menbers
has offered to fax the tension instructions.  Thank you Barry.  Will I need
the flywheel lock or any other tools?

In reference to the water pump, can anyone answer whether it is better to
purchase a new pump versus a rebuilt one?  Since the pumps seem to have a
design weeakness, does anyone rebuild to a higher standard?  Better bearings
perhaps?

Thank you, Claus Groth, '86 951
