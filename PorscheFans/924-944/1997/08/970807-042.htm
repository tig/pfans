During the six weeks that I have owned the car, steering has been perfectly
smooth.  all of the rotors were all worn beyond minimum so I installed a new
OEM set with new brake pads.  

Now there is a shimmy felt in the steering wheel, none felt in the floor.
 The strange thing is that the wheel shakes rather strongly for a little
while, then gradually subsides to smooth (or very close) and then gets
stronger again.  Each complete cycle takes almost one mile.  

This doesn't make any sense to me.  The front rotors are bolted to the hub
and should have no impact on vibration.  The hubs were installed on the same
spindles with original, repacked bearings.  Rear rotors, on the other hand,
can have an impact on wheel location but I don't feel anything in the floor
or seat.

All guesses and suggestions are welcomed.
