Here is the rudimentary removal process.  I removed the turbo from my '89 944
turbo, so some 951s may be different.

I'm *not* finished with this, so bear with me.  This is mainly for the folks
that want to remove their turbos now.  When I finish it I'll re-submit it to
Kevin Gross so that he may put it into the faq, if he wants to.  (or where ever
it should go)


Please don't be offended by anything (not that it's offensive), and if you
notice mistakes, please tell me!!!!!!

        Removing the turbocharger on the Porsche 944 turbo.

Now that I've finally finished removing my turbo I'd like to mention
a few things about the mental aspect.  The biggest problem with removing
the turbo on the 951 is the lack of apriori knowledge.  I spent much time
trying to deduce how to remove the turbo prior to actually removing
it.  I failed.  I had hoped to wake up one day and know all aspects
of turbo removal.  I failed.

So, to get to the point.  The biggest frustration is not the actual
removal of the turbo, but the lack of knowledge going into removing
the turbo.  Plus the many hard to reach nuts and bolts...

It is the lack of knowledge that led me to question my sanity while
doing this project.

Hopefully, I can fill that knowledge part in...


----


The 944 turbo's turbo is mounted upon the driver's side engine mount.
The center section of the turbo is connected to the mount by two easily
stripped 6mm allen head bolts inaccessible from beneath the mount.

In case the two 6mm allen head bolts break, the turbo is securely
fastened into place by two exhaust pipes.  The exhaust pipes connect
to the turbo's hot housing via 4 bolt flanges.  On my car one flange
had four 15mm bolts, the other had four 14mm bolts.  The intake
pipe is the spiral off the donut, the outake is the center of the turbo.
This is opposite of the compressor side of the turbo.  (someone correct
me if I'm wrong)

When removing the exhaust pipes, you only need to remove the intake pipe
that is directly connected to the turbo intake.  The other exhaust pipe
(the one that connects to the center of the turbo) connects to the engine
block, and the rest of the exhaust.  You remove those bolts, not the ones that
connect it to the turbo.  This will save you some time and trouble.
In other words you remove the turbo with part of an exhaust pipe still
attached to it.  However, I'm jumping ahead of myself...


The turbo has one oil line connected to the top of the center section.
This line feeds oil through the turbo over the shaft and down through the
bottom.  Oil passes through the engine mount into the return line
attached to the bottom of the mount.  The return line connects directly
to the oil pan.

The coolant lines connect to the turbo center section from the sides.
Coolant is forced through the turbo by an auxiliary water pump.


The remaining connections to the turbo are the ones to the compressor
side.  Going into the center of the turbo compressor is the intake boot.
Connected to the donut part (the out-take) is a rubber pipe that connects
to the aluminum inter-cooler tube.  Both of these items (the pipe and the
boot) are attached by hose clamps.


Getting to the turbo...


Porsche decided to keep the turbo well protected from spies by imbedding it
deep within the engine bay.  Odds are, most 944 turbo owners have never
actually seen their turbo.  Uncovering the beast yields exclamations of
surprise and relief...why it looks like any other turbo...

The primary item the turbo is under, is the intake manifold and its connecting
parts.  The following is a paraphrased version of the factory manual's method
to
uncover/remove the (in a hushed voice) turbo...



As with any important porsche work (and all porsche work is important),
disconnect the negative lead on the battery.  Also make sure the engine
compartment doesn't have too much dirt in it.  Dirt can fall into the
engine as we are removing the intake manifold.

---from above---

Remove air cleaner, then remove the charging pipes.  You might want to start
taking pictures, or marking connections at this point...helpful went trying
to re-assemble.


Next, make sure engine is cool...

Remove fuel feed and fuel return lines from the fuel rail.  There really isn't
too much fuel in the lines, and don't worry too much about fuel spraying out.
However do becareful and have plenty of rags to wipe up any spilt fuel.
Disconnect vacuum hoses from the pressure regulator and pressure damper.
 Remove
cable from cruise control and place out of way...


Little hint: The fuel system section in the turbo workshop manual supplement
contains
a diagram of all the vacuum hoses and fuel lines connecting to their
appropriate
places.  It may be a good idea to invest in the book or the micro-fiche.


Remove spark plug wires and distributor cap.  Remove bolts that hold the fuel
rail
to the cam housing and intake manifold.  Carefully remove rail (with injectors
connected to it) from the instake manifold.  This will expose small holes
to the intake valves, careful not to drop stuff in them.


Disconnect throttle cable, and remove vacuum hoses from the intake manifold.
Remove intake manifold. With throttle attached.  You may not be able to get
the 10 mm bolt holding the dipstick tube on to the intake manifold.  Don't
worry, the tube will come up with the manifold (atleast mine did).  COVER
UP THE INTAKE PORTS!!!!

---from below---


Remove engine splash guard..

Drain coolant, and drain it all.  I drained half of it, and everytime I go
to the garage there is a little coolant on the flow (temp fluctuations seem
to force some out every night).  Might as well make a mess once.

The manual says to loosen the dipstick and remove, if you haven't already.


Remove the master cylinder heat shield.  This is harder than it sounds.  The
shield is bolted to the body by bolts that are hard to get to.  Good luck, and
*do* take it off, it'll make life a lot easier later on.

I then deviated from the manual and removed all the coolant lines and oil lines
to the turbo.  I also removed the turbo water pump and associated mount.  This
give me more room to view the turbo.  I ended up also removing the shield that
protects the engine from the turbo.  This shield covers the oil line from
the balance shaft housing to the turbo.

I also removed the intake boot and lower air intake assembly (the part that
holds the filter).

Unscrew the bolt that connects the turbo exhaust assembly to the engine.  It is
a 13mm bolt.  The bolt connects an exhaust flange to the engine block.  It is
next
to the dipstick hole.

Now unbolt that flange (the one attached to the engine) from the exhaust pipe.
Do not bother unbolting that pipe from the turbo.  It comes out with the turbo
(from there you can unbolt it).  This will make your life easier, I spent a
days needlessly removing three of the bolts holding the thing to the
turbo...

Unbolt the other flange from the turbocharger, this is the flange that is
closest to the wheel well.  You can get to two of the bolts from above with
a small crescent wrench (my bolts were 15mm).  The other two you can reach
from underneath.  You may want to remove the oil return line connected to
the engine mount going to the oil pan, it'll give you a little more room.
I was able to use a small crescent wrench and a pivot head wrachet.

The above process is the biggest terror of this job.

The next terror is actually removing the turbo.  It is held, from underneath
by two six mm allen head bolts.  To get to these bolts, remove the stearing
u-joint heat shield (it is right above the u-joing of the stearing wheel.

I found it necessary to unbolt the stearing rack and push it out of the way
so I could reach one of the allen bolts holding the turbo on.  Porsche deemed
it necessary to put one of those demon bolts right above the stearing u-joint.

-----

Carefully pull the turbo up (with it's remaining exhaust pipe still connected
to it).  Once out, remove the exhaust pipe.


Send turbo off.

While you wait, clean the top of the engine...


Things not to do to the turbo:


Don't kick the turbo.

Because:
It is made of cold aluminum and even colder steel.
It weighs 17 pounds.
It will break.
It will give you more grief.


Don't wrap it in paper and ship it.

Because:
Someone might unwrap it and steal it.  Then put it on
their car.  You wouldn't want to cause anybody that
much grief, even if they deserve it.
It will break.
It will give you more grief.

I ended up shipping my turbo in styrofoam box, in a
cardboard box.  I packed peanuts around the turbo
to make the turbo people happy.
