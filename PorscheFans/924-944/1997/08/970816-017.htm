The airbags have been deployed or stolen while in the hands of PO or 
PPO.  In any case, I'm going to replace them.  Looking at the shop manual 
(yehaw, the manuals came in) shows that Porsche recommends replacing 
every piece of the airbag system except the wiring and the dashboard 
lightbulb.  This includes airbags, sensors and control unit.  I'm wondering 
what the point is of replacing the sensors and control unit.  My guess is 
that the sensors are just inertial relays of some type and the control unit is 
a micro.  What would be the point of replacing these?  Does anyone know 
of any reason why the sensors or control unit would be single use or is 
Porsche just being extremely cautious about this.

I am in fact buying the whole system from someone tracking their car so I 
could replace them but the sensor locations are a little inconvenient and a 
special toothed socket is required to unbolt them.  I replaced the dash 
lights today so I'm going to try to dump the control unit codes tomorrow 
and see what error codes appear.

Anyone have any experience with this?  Any input?

An interesting note on attitudes I have encountered during this process.  It 
seems like most people currently have a very negative attitude about 
airbags.  My reasons for replacing the system are not primarily safety.   It's 
not costing me a fortune, it gives me a chance to get to know my new car, 
I'm not fond of the MOMO wheel and this is the only visible aspect of my 
car which is not stock.  But I still think whacking a bag of air under a 
dozen g's of deceleration is preferable to kissing a steering wheel.  Most 
of the reports I've read indicate VERY FEW incidents of harm related to 
airbag deployment while the number of lives saved is several orders of 
magnitude higher.  And, it seems like most of the detrimental impacts 
have been related to misunderstanding or misuse of airbag systems.  Don't 
want to start a holy war.  Just observations/opinions.

P.S.  Yes,I will disconnect the battery.  Yes, I  will cover the negative 
terminal to prevent contact.  Yes, I will wait an hour to bleed off any 
capacitance :-)
