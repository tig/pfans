I am not sure exactly how the oil pressure relief valve(OPRV) works. Obviously 
it is made to relieve pressure above some thresh-hold(presumably above 5 BAR). 
Perhaps if it is stuck completely open it could reduce pressure at the low 
end? Anyone know? The pressure relief valve screws into the oil/coolant heat 
exchanger housing, and extends into the block. If the housing is misaligned, 
the OPRV will bid. It is unlikely you are having this problem unless the 
oil/coolant heat exchanger was recently serviced. My note was meant to be food 
for thought, perhaps the shop is very competent.
Good Luck,
Ezra
