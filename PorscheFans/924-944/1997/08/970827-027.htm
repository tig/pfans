The two ton ones are more of a squarish wide and shallow U while the three 
ton ones are more rounded at the bottom than Y shaped.  I got them at 
Autozone and they were like $10 for the 2 ton and $15 for the 3 ton.  It 
sounds like the 3 ton ones may be best for the rear as they are rounded.

I understand the car is pretty evenly weighted so I don't guess it matters 
which I put in front but do I have enough stand???  I don't know the 
physics of totally lifting a 3000 pound objects and supporting it with four 
1"x2" posts sitting atop a 1 sq. ft. base.  I got the stands on separate 
trips which is why I have two different types.

The end of the torsion bar is exactly what I wanted to use in the rear but 
I did not want to try it until I had some experienced guidance (Torsion bar 
being the round stubs that extend in front of the rear wheel).  The front 
is tricky, a stand with a peg at the top would be great if someone could 
fabricate one.  I did leave the jack under the car but if one side fell it 
would still be really uncomfortable.  I will try to locate some old RR tie, 
that sounds like a great idea!

Thanks!!!!
