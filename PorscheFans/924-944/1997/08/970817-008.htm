Congratulations are in order to George Beuselinck and Judy Hendrickson.

While rambling through my August issue of Panorama, page 34, I found that 
both of these individuals were awarded first place in the Robert Bosch 
Technical Quiz.  George won overall in the men's category and Judy won 
the overall women's.  George and Judy also scored first in their 
specialized categories.  George snagged first in, what else, the 
924/944/968, while Judy ran away with the 914 category!

This also won George and Judy a picture of themselves on the same page 
(pp. 34).  For anyone interested in connecting the voices to their 
pictures, have a look.

I am sure I speak for everyone when I say that we, as members of Porsche 
Fans, are very proud to have their expert knowledge and unending 
contributions that they have made on behalf of the rest of the members.  
I know that I personally have benefited from George's knowledge many, 
many times.

Thanks, and congratulations for your commitments to the marque!

Marv
