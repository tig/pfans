The PO installed an illuminated one on my machine, with the word PORSCHE 
on it.  The fit is ok, but it is slightly cheesy, but not enough to make 
me want to remove it.  The letters are square instead of being thin 
horizontally as the classic Porsche logo looks.. probably because whoever 
made the unit didn't license the logo from Porsche.  So the look is kind 
of dorky.  I would look for a plain one with no lettering.

My car already has Porsche embossed into the rubber spoiler edge, and the 
sticker on the painted ledge between the bumper and the tail lights, so 
the word is there three times!

You will have to relocate your license plate to the bumper, and some
drilling will be required (shudder). If I had the car as new, I probably
wouldn't have bothered to install one. 

Send the guys and girls who don't know what kind of car you drive back to 
their plebian transportation appliances and tell them it is a Ferrari. ;-)
