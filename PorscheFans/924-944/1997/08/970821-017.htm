Yesterday I posted my problems with a local dealer, and their botched removal 
of the State inspection sticker. I am happy to say I was able to remove the 
remains of the sticker and restore the windshield to almost perfect condition. 
Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions to me.

First, some info on Sekuriflex windshields:

   The PO replaced my windshield at some point with a Sekuriflex windshield 
which I understand is not standard on US 944's. Most US 944's have Sekurit 
windshields which are easier to deal with. Sekuriflex windshields have a soft 
plastic coating on the interior surface. To determine if you have such a 
coating, gently press your fingernail into the interior surface of the 
windshield and see if you make an indentation. The indentation will go away if 
you don't press too hard. This surface also scratches and scuffs easily. NO 
stickers should be applied to such windshields without first applying a 
protective clear sticker from Porsche.

  Ok, now onto how to R&R such windshields. 

****** Removal of Stickers and gummy residue **************

Supplies:
          o Soft Paper Towels
          o Ethanol (I used 190proof), ISO-propyl may work? 
          o Windex or similar glass cleaner
          o High quality wide clear tape (I used thick 3M weather tape, 
            you want a clear tape on which the adhesive will not easily 
            separate from the plastic backing)

Procedure:

 Thoroughly clean the inside and outside of your windshield with windex soaked 
paper towels before proceeding.

 The dealer that botched my sticker removal tried using water to soak the 
sticker off. This resulted in a thick smeared mess of gummy sticker residue 
with small amounts of the original paper sticker embedded within. Since I 
started at this stage, you may need to improvise a bit to remove the paper 
portion of your sticker. I suggest placing clear tape over the sticker, 
rubbing it on well with your fingernail, and pulling as much of the sticker 
off as possible.

  Once you have exposed the gummy residue (GR), soak a small section of a 
paper towel in Ethanol and apply to a section of the GR. You want to soften 
the GR, so you may need to refresh your paper towel with more alcohol as it 
evaporates quickly. Gently rub the paper towel around on the GR. Once you see 
the GR smearing, let the alcohol evaporate until a tacky surface is obtained 
on the GR. Now rub a piece of clear tape onto the GR. and peal the tape up. If 
only a small amount of GR adheres to the tape, you will need to soak the GR 
with more alcohol. If the GR is not sticking well to the tape, you did not 
allow enough time for the alcohol to evaporate. If you have it just right, 
almost all of the GR will lift off, revealing your Sekuriflex coating. You 
will need to repeat this until most of the GR is removed. Make sure you use 
new pieces of tape EVERY time or you will end up re-applying the GR to your 
windshield. During this process you may end up with small bits of GR on other 
portions of your windshield. To remove these, first wipe with an alcohol 
soaked paper towel, and then with a windex soaked paper towel. Since the 
alcohol slightly softens the Sekuriflex coating, the windex soaked paper towel 
is needed to remove remaining alcohol and bits of GR. If you use a dry paper 
towel, you risk scratching the Sekuriflex coating and/or adhering small 
amounts of paper towel. If you just wipe with the alcohol towel, you may leave 
streaks. Once you have removed most of the GR with the above tape method, you 
will need to use fresh sections of alcohol soaked paper towel and then windex 
soaked paper towels in an iterative wiping fashion until all remaining GR is 
removed.

  I was able to remove all GR, and obtain a clear Sekuriflex coating in about 
an hours time. There is some slight optical abberration to the area where the 
sticker was located, I believe this is due to slight swelling of the 
Sekuriflex coating. Perhaps this will go away with time, perhaps not, but it 
is very minor, and only visible from an angle. With the new protective sticker 
and inspection sticker, it will look new.

  It is also surprisingly easy to remove scuff marks from the surface of the 
Sekuriflex coating. I had a couple of scuff marks that look as thought they 
were created by dragging a ring or other jewelry across the Sekuriflex 
coating. By gently rubbing with an alcohol soaked pad, and then wiping down 
with a  windex soaked paper towel, I was able to remove all signs of these 
scuff marks. In fact, the windshield looks brand new again.

Good Luck, sorry about the length of the posting...

Ezra
