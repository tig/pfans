Wes,

        I=92m not familiar with the model detectors your asking about,
however I recently purchased a Valentine One. Greatest investment I ever
made. It blows away my old passport, escort and Bel635(all these have
lights and tones). The Valentine has directional arrows so you know exact=
ly
where the signal is coming from it also shows the strength of the signal
and the type. You can actual track the signal from the forward to side to=

rear as you pass it. I ordered mine with the optional front and rear lase=
r
detector. The other day I was cruising home from work when the detector
light up like a xmas tree. The indicator immediately told me there was
laser in front of me(the indicators are so distinct that there=92s no
guessing at all as to what type or where is it) I hit the brakes
downshifted and changed lanes. No ticket this time. The detector also has=

three modes so you can have it filter out the false signals which works
really great.
I=92m in the Metro NY area and commute from Long Island to New Jersey eve=
ry
day you can=92t imagine how many false signals are mixed with real ones. =
The
signal counter also lets you know how many signals you are tracking at on=
e
time. The other day going through NYC I tracked 8 at one time. Anyway the=

unit with the laser is $399. Call Mike Valentine at  Valentine Research a=
t
1-800-331-3030, or 513-984-8900, Cincinnati, Ohio. If you think this soun=
ds
to good to be true check out Road & Track they just did another compariso=
n
test. Valentine One came out on top again. Mike Valentine is the Co-found=
er
of Cincinnati Microwave who developed the Escort Detector.
I hoped this helped and good luck.

I=92m not able to post to the list from this location, so if you need to
reach me E-mail is Nuzzot@Dmrtrecom.com or 105506.474@compuserve.com =
