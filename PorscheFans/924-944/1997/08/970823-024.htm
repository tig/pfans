I haven't found this in any catalog so I don't know what model it is (maybe 
P 36).

Black leather 3 spoke wheel.
3 cylindrical radial spokes at 3,6 & 9 o'clock positions.
Small white letters say "MOMO" on left spoke and "DESIGNED BY 
F.A. PORSCHE" on right spoke.  There are 2 ids of some type on the 
back of the spokes which might indicate model.
#1) TYP P 36
#2) KBA 70067
The center horn button has a PD logo.

Has following pieces:
- steering wheel
- padded leather cover over center
- 3-4" tall collapsible tower with signal cancel ear and sliding horn contact 
on base.
- rubber accordion boot for tower
- wheel secured to tower with 6 2.5mm allen head bolts (under cover)

- Perfect condition, no scratches, no wear marks on leather, etc
- Sorry, no installation/application docs or receipts (came with the car)
$100 + shipping

This seems to move the steering wheel up and out slightly versus the 
OEM wheel.  Actually, I'm 6' and I liked this location better.  Only dash 
viewing obstruction was that it semi-covered the big "!" indicator light but 
I could read by that when it's on :-)  I can't tell about how the horn or 
signal cancel work as neither worked on my car.  Then again, I've put a 
stock wheel back on and the horn and cancel still don't work :-(

Installation time:  After disconnecting battery and waiting 1/2 hour to 
"safe" the airbags, it took me about 15 minutes to swap the wheels.
