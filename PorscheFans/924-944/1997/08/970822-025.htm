Ditto.  Actually, I barely missed and drove right between deer that we
ahead of me with my original 944S headlights(I am happy to be alive) on
I64.  Two weeks later, this time equipped with Hella H4s on the 944S, I
chanced upon a herd of 20 deer and though I was going at the same speed as
on I64 I saw them with plenty of time to stop as they decided to cross the
road. The projection pattern has great off-axis distribution which enabled
me to see them right before they got on the road.  The original headlights
had no usable off-axis distribution.  Definitely made the car a safer car
to drive.

     I understand that the 951's undertray is slightly different (and maybe 
     has a few more pieces?) from the NA 944 undertray.  What exactly are 
     the differences, and are the two styles still reasonably 
     interchangeable?  Or must I use an undertray from a 951 on my '86 951?
     
     Thanks,
     Ben (and I hope this isn't automatically posted 3 times)
