Just one of those days.
Picked up my 86 944 from the paint shop after they had it for a week. Boy you get addicted to these things! Anyway the paint job (front clip) looks pretty good and I'm happy to be driving again. Well, for a while anyway. Half way home I lose all power abruptly. All gauges read normal, tach still show actual RPM but no power at all. So I put it in neutral and it idled just fine while coasting and stopped. Give it gas and it will rev up but only to just under 2K and then all power is lost until its back to 1K. In fact if you hold the gas down it cycles. It will pick up RPMs to 2k like normal then no power and back to 1K and then the power comes on again back to 2k. odd. I was only 2 miles from home and I drove the rest of the way staying below 2k. The throttle response was normal and the car would pull just fine to 2k and then abruptly power off until idle speed again. In fact I found that if I exceeded 2k I would just put the clutch in and when idle speed was reached I could go back into gear and use power. (As long as I didn't exceed 2k),
I am mystified. There is no backfiring or rough running. The only possible clue is that the shop did jump start the car once. But it did run just fine for the first 15 miles of the trip home.

I really hate the great day to sucky day swings. It looks good just sitting in the garage.

I would love any help!! Thanks

Chris White
