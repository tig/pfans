Has anyone on the list been to or heard anything about the Car Guys
driving school?  They hold driving schools at many of the tracks in the
east.  I am considering attending one of their schools scheduled for
Road Atlanta.  The cost of the school is $450 for the Road Atlanta venue
which by the way is the most expensive venue.  The course consists of
two days of classroom and track education.  I want to make certain the
school is worth the money as the date I would like to attend conflicts
with the Alabama regions two-day DE event which are always very well
done and are much less expensive.
thanks
