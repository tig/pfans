Zak,

Regarding the front spoiler: get copies of Excellence, European Car, Panorama 
etc. and call the recyclers who advertise there. I recently bought a used 
spoiler in excellent condition from NPR (Nebraska parts recyclers, 800 279 
5183) for something like $300. Of course you would need to paint it.

Unfortunately I don't think your car is "worth" (market value)  the money you 
have in it. I see '83 944s advertised all the time for around $3500. If yours 
is really nice, maybe it's worth $5000. Parts & labor are so expensive for 
these cars, it's hard to justify putting much money into an old one unless you 
do your own repairs, shop mail order for parts, etc. The best thing to do with 
your car, now that you know it's in good condition, is to just keep it, drive 
it every day, and enjoy the hell out of it.

Good luck,
Nick Craft

Subject:	worth?

I was just wondering if I could get some opinions on how much my car is
worth...
its a 83 944 (I looked at the imports figures--5506 83's in the US) that is
light brass metallic (a rare color from what I can tell) 16" Fuchs wheels,
80k miles needs reuphaulstry (those nasty tweed seats) mechanically great
condition--bought it for 4500$ and sunk 4k$ into it immediately (belts, oil
cooler, seals, motor mounts, paint touch up, tires) just wondering how much
you guys thought it was worth.  Also if anyone has or knows of a front
spoiler for sale CHEAP please let me know.....factory piece is 750-1000$
(uhhhh)

thanks
Zak Vrba
