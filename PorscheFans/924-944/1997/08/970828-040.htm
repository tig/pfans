M030 was definitely available on the "late" 924S, circa 1988. Because of
the weight advantage and SCCA rules regarding cars with factory-supplied
adjustable suspensions, the 924S was (is?) a very competitive autocross
vehicle.

I believe Jeff Reitmer drove one; there was also one for sale on this list
several months ago.
