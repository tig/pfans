I find a dc amp meter and remove each fuse one at a time.  I'd measure the
current draw across the two fuse terminals and see which circuit the draw
is coming from.  That gives you and idea where to start looking.  I had
the same problem when I purchased my used 944 5 years ago.  After
replacing the battery and the voltage regulater, I went looking for the
problem.  Finally found that the previous owner had an alarm system that
was removed from the car before he sold it.  When that was done, they put
the "backlit" clock light circuit on the wrong ignition switch terminal
(used hot always instead of hot with ignition key on).  So that's why the
backlit was on all the time; I didn't know any better!  Once I moved the 
connection to the right terminal, I haven't had anymore problems. 

Hope this helps.
