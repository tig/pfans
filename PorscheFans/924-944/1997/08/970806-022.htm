Just to get in on a love feast.

I am on my second 944 (first found a wall at the Glenn), and I treat my '44 
with kindness (new oil Mobil 1 every 2-3k miles.

I stopped trying to keep the belts on schedule as so I am on my second head 
rebuild (1st @ 80k, 2nd @ 130k) each time it has cost about $1800.

Given the cost of major service in this area is $350 - 400 I view it as a 
break even deal plus I get a whole top end job. I just got my 1st water 
pump so all in all this car has cost me about $5k over the last 10 years, 
add that to cost new 25k, it comes to about $3k per year in cost assuming 
no recovery value.

And I am far from giving it up.

From an "investment" perspective it is apparent at this point--with prices
seeming to have dropped a bit over the last three years or so--that most
of the earlier 944s are not investment grade (i.e buy, appreciate, sell for
more $ that you have paid/put into it) vehicles.

What they are, however, is a hell of a lot of fun to drive, and that is 
what
they were made for.  I don't put money into my 83 na for resale value, I
do it to keep it as meticulously mechanically (and otherwise) sound as
possible because I LOVE TO DRIVE IT and it still responds beautifully
after 150,000 miles.  This car is of value to me beyond $.  And I always
hope to be driving one, until I'm too decrepit to get in and out of it :-).

FWIW, IMHO--

James
