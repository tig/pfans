Sent this about a month ago. No responses. Try, try again....

After about a year of soaking up a minor seep under the reservoir with
three Bounty paper towels folded and jammed between the two lines and the
frame, I thought I would finally fix it by installing the new suction
line between the reservoir and the pump. (BTW, the paper towels caught
all the seepage. It occurred only after parking...never noted any fluid
after driving).

Anyway, the new suction line didn't fix it completely. there was still a
seep from the return line at the reservoir.  I pulled the line off the
reservoir nipple, cut off about an inch and reinstalled it on the nipple.
The problem is that I can't get it all the way on. It's about halfway on
and the hose is starting to split along a parting line. (Old age). I've
clamped it so I can drive and there's presently no seepage.

Does anybody have a fix for the return line other than replacing the
whole line? I'd like to find a straight nipple and a section of new hose
to splice in, but no luck so far. Any tips, comments, parts sources would
be appreciated.
