Hello,

> 1) Would using water spray to cool intercoolers and brakes be legal in
> the PCA club racing stock class?

The Club Race rule book, in the General Rules section, states:

1. The PCA CLub Racing Program is designed to be fun, safe, and competitive.
   Good sportsmanship, honest, and a sense of fair play should exist at
   all times.

4. Any modification not specifically listed is not allowed. In other words,
   if the rules dont say you can do it, DON'T.

In the Stock class description:
1. Engine
   D. Turbocharged cars cannot exceed factory specified maximum boost,
      nor can any of the stock turbocharger, turbocharger plumbing, or
      boost control components be replaced with non-stock components
      or altereed in any way that could affect performance.

So I take it mean that adding a water sprayer would not be legal.
The rules are pretty clear. For example, if you wonder about exhaust
systems, the rules state:
   E. Exhaust system is free providing the engine meets any local
      noise limit requirements.
 
> 2) Would you recommend removing the backing plates from all the brakes
> to decrease termperatures?

Almost everyone recomments this. The rules state:
4. Brakes
   A. Pad material is free
   B. Brake calipers and rotors must be as supplied by the factory for
      the year and type of vehicle
   C. Grooving/slotting/drilling of rotors is allowed
   D. Ducting of air to rotors is allowed
   E. Removal of dust shields (backing plates) is allowed
  
That said, I haven't removed my backing plates. When I replaced my
rotors last week I took a good look at the backing plates. On the
944 turbo S models, there are so many holed in the backing plate
that I can't see it doing anything. There's a large cut out for the
1 vent, and 2 smaller cutouts for additional venting. There just
isn't enough plate to make a difference (IMHO).
