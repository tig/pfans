That about sums it up.  Lotus has made great efforts in curing some of 
the ill effects of front wheel drive.  One of the demons that seem to 
plague those cars is called torque steer (not a breed of cow).  Also, as 
pointed out below, steering with spinning wheels reduces the ability to 
gain traction in a turn.

>On the thread of fwd:  Although there have been a few instances of fwd in

>and sedately driven machinery.  It would also be O.K. on cars that are just
>posturing as performance machines.  However, in the context of serious road

>matter how you slice it, fwd is a big compromise.  It's really not just
>tradition or coincidence that F1, CART and even NASCAR for that matter
>(ever notice that the cars they try to 'sell on Monday' are fwd, unlike the
