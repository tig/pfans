No, I am not a air-cooled fan.  In fact I am the proud owner of a 93 968 =
that I love and typically turn better times at my home track (Brainerd =
International Raceway) than many of the air-cooled guys.

You wouldn't happen to be an air cooled fan would you? The
"wasserpumper" is here to stay. Sooner or later you guys will be telling
tall tales of the green stuff. I stand corrected it looks like sooner,
rather than later.
