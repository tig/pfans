Hello All,

I have been getting the urge for a 951 real bad lately thanks to reading
the list.  I am a little confused by the differences in various years.

It appears by the HP ratings I see here on the net that there is little
difference year to year including the 88-89 Turbo S versions.  I realize
that as with all 944s ther were many changes at 85-1/2 and a few again
at 87.

I only see one listing for 88-89 turbos and don,t understand.  Are all
88-89's turbo-s models or is the S version a limited production special
those years with the standard also available?  I realize the S has
extras like "tweaked" breaks, suspension etc.

There is a 89 Turbo S for sale locally by a drivers Ed instructor.  It
was his personal car prior to his Corvette purchase.  Car has cat pipe,
chipped, roll bar, new head gasket and possibly more.  I have not looked
yet (possible fear of Love at first sight) but car has 70K and a
"crease" in rear fender from a parking lot mishap.  Owner asking $14.5K
and claims price is low due to dent.  I am wondering if this is a deal
or not.

It appears I can buy other 951s for nearly 5K less and they have nearly
the same HP.  My present is a 87NA automatic so any of the force fed
cars will seem like Mach 2 with my hair on fire.

Guide me O knowledgable ones.
