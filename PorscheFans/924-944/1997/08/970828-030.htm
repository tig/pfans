I totally agree.  I had to drive my grandfather's 1991 Plymouth
Voyager/Dodge Caravan at freeway speeds once.  I have never felt more
unsafe behind the wheel.  It was physically excruciating to drive that
thing, and I don't know where anyone gets the idea that most of these cars
are safe.

Same here.  I had a Scirocco series I with jet-black tinted windows,
lowered suspension, aftermarket rims, and the then-fashionable all-white
AMG-look paint jobs.  I was pulled over so many times it wasn't even funny.
Usually it was just a "routine check."  When I got the 951, I breezed
right though the same parts of town and the fuzz paid no attention at all.
The Porsche has a LOUD B&B exhaust system, too.  In the 6 years since I've
owned the 951, I have not been stopped, ever (knock on wood).
