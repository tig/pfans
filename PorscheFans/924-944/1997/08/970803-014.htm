I have a 1982 944 (European Model) LHD imported from Germany to England.
It has around 200,000 Km on the clock and the oil pressure is getting a b=
it
low ie. 40PSI fully warmed up at 4,000 rpm. I was driving home from work
yesterday from Cardiff to Bristol coming up to the old severn bridge, Its=
 a
pretty good bit of road.
I had been thrashing it  up to 220KM(135MPH) flat out passing a couple of=

old MGB's as if they were standing still thinking "hah rusty old English
sports cars". When I noticed that the oil pressure had started to reduce
and the flickering temp guage was flickering towards the warm end, I
started to slow down & noticed that putting my foot on the accelerator ha=
d
no effect any more, I could not hear the engine very well as I had both
windows open and the roof out, the wind noise was incredible as my sunroo=
f
wind deflector is missing. I put the car into neutral and coasted to a st=
op
on the hard shoulder but at the last second I could hear a clattering
sound. The engine temp was bending the needle & the engine would not turn=

over, It felt a bit stiff. After an hour of turning the crankshaft by han=
d
& a long knuckle bar to free it up the engine had cooled down a little &
would start but it sounds terrible, there is a loud knocking noise from
some where but the oil pressure light still goes out. I presume that the
main bearings have gone, does any body think I would get away with just
changing them & getting the crank ground or do you think the cam/balance
shaft bearings will be damaged as well, before this I had very good
compression & used hardly any oil.
I feel confident enough to strip the engine and replace any worn parts bu=
t
is it best left to a professional engine builder ?
