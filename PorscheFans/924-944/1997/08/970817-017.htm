	Yesterday I had the engine on my 89 951 'die' for about 5 seconds while
I was driving down the motorway. I was travelling on level ground at
about 75, it was not raining. The engine restored itself and there have
been  no further instances so far. I am assuming that this is
electrical. I was not low on gas.  I recall a few weeks ago someone had
a similar problem.  If you are still out there what was the fix. I just
hope I am not entering a new and infinitely more expensive phase of
Porsche ownership.

Richard.
