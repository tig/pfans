Well Richard,

I'll have you know that our police do much more than that.  They have to:
1) pull over as many red porsche's in a day as they can
2) eat as many Dunkin Donuts as possible (supporting the economy)
3) remember to find all of the people that picked on them in school for being a
pencil necked geek and give them tickets for 3 over
4) play with their flashing red and blue thingies
5) try to impress the girls with their shiny gun
6) learn all of the tough talk and radio lingo to sound important for the girls
7) pull over some more shiny red porsche's
8) try to catch Bill's motorcycle again (sorry boys, keep trying)
9) sit on the side of the road and talk to each other while theives steal my
boat
10) save the beautiful girls cat from the tree (by shooting it down)

So you see Richard, our police are very busy over here, pulling us over for
bright headlights is just one of their many duties.
