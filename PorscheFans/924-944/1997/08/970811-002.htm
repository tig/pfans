Hey folks!  I have a few questions.  I posted one or two before about
the time the list died so please excuse any repeats.

2).  The underside of my hood does not have any insulation.  Should a
951 have this?
>>1989 models did not have the insulation.


3).  I am thinking about removing the bottom tray under the engine so
that I can drive up to one of these spray washes and clean the bottom of
the engine/chassis.  Will this hurt anything?  I think I have several
leaks and the tray is catching the evidence.
>>>This will work but good lucke getting it up in the air high enough.

4).  Will any 8 Valve 944 head fit my turbo? 
>>>No, you need a turbo head as the exhaust ports are ceramic lined.

5).  Has anyone put a 6 speed transmission from a 968 into a 951???
$$$$$$$.  You need to replace the torque tube and shifter mechanism.
