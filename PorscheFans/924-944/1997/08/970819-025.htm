Well, Pfans, the flatbed tow truck is on its way to pick up my car and take
it to one of the local Porsche dealers (Napleton Porsche, Elmhurst,
Illinois).  Then, my State Farm agent will dispatch a claims rep to survey
the damage (or, at least, have a talk with the service department about all
the possibilities).  What I was able to remove from the car has dried out
pretty well, although some manuals and other paperwork are still in the
process of "curing".  I'll keep the list informed as things progress.
Thanks to those of you who have already answered to my plight.

For those of you who read the post from Steve.P.Cox@unilever.com regarding
his 1988 944 Turbo SE, I sent him a private e-mail last night with some
basic information on Turbo S production.  He responded this morning with
some unusual tidbits of his own:
	SE possibly meaning Special Equipment
	Total imported to England approx 75 (no positive confirmation by
either Porsche Club Britain or Porsche GB, the importers)
	14 units plus 1 write-off known of in the owners club
	Some of the UK cars have a TURBO script on the right front fender
(or wing, as he calls it)
	His car doesn't have a hinged cassette box on the center console,
whereas all the others do.
	One of the cars has a control on the waste gate outlet pipe
presumably to vary the boost.

I will be sending him a list of the published magazine articles I have
copies of so that he can see the performance data and how it compared to
other models.

"Talk" to you later
