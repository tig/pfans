I'd like an answer to this too -- let me know what responses
you get.

Here's a further conundrum.  Put 36PSI in all your tires.  The
air in your tires supports the car through the contact patch area.
The total area of the four contact patches must be A = Weight/36.
Now put wider tires on the car and inflate them to 36psi.  The
total contact patch area is still A = Weight/36.  So how do wider
tires help -- there's not more rubber on the road!  Is the difference
in the shape of the contact patch?  If so, how does this work?

One thing that's clear - your physics book says that the friction
force in linear in the normal force.  Tires aren't, and that's
what makes suspension tuning possible and necessary.  Friction force
from a tire is sub-linear in the normal force.

I've wondered about the tire width business myself -- clearly the
elementary physics doesn't include information.
