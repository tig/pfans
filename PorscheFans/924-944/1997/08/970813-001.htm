Thanks to those who replied after my timing belt failed last week, I ran
a compression test last night and think I may have survived, all
cylinders are between 165 and 190 psi according to Haynes the tolerance
is down to 85 psi. Don mentioned that if you have a N/A 924 (With 8:1
compression) it should survive, with a UK model which mine is it
shouldn't, but I guess that depends on what your valve clearances are,
when I last checked mine about 5k ago and they were all at the max
tolerance. 
I'm thinking that the bigger valve clearance has meant the valves don't
open as far, therefore I didn't bend any valves. Am I talking rubbish or
does this make sense to anybody else.
I'll refit the V belt charge the battery and hopefully it will fire up
tonight, I've got to go and find a seven stone weakling to check the
belt tension first though...
