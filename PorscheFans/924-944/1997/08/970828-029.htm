To add my two cents to the whole discussion on police, I have had
experiences on both sides of the fence with the NY State Troopers in the
Albany area. I had one occasion where I had broken down all by myself on
I-87 at night, and the trooper who stopped to check things out ended up
driving me all the way home, a distance of a good 15 miles, chatting
about cars and racing the whole way! (I was driving a Diesel Rabbit at
the time)

OTOH, when I was driving my little red sports car (not a P-car, a
T***mph TR7) down that same stretch of road on a Feb 28th., the road was
_swarming_ with troopers who were all behind on their quotas because of
the short month! In spite of the fact that I was going a steady 55 in
the right-hand lane, a trooper pulled out of the holding pen and cruised
up to look me over very closely. He then proceeded to pull me over and
attempt to write me four tickets, only one of which (uninspected
vehicle) was valid!!! (he didn't even bother writing the other three,
since I argued with him and he knew there was no way he could make them
stick).

Let's face it, we all can expect special attention because of our chosen
method of transportation...
