After receiving many e mails on how to obtain adjustable boost I am
sending this again.

John,

There is a hose coming from the wastegate leading to the intake
manifold. This hose controls the amount of time the wastegate stays
closed. When you open the throttle this hose builds vaccum to the
wastegate opening it and letting off additional boost pressure. The
trick here is bleeding off some of the vaccunm to trick the wastegate to
stay closed longer. This will result in boost that will literaly snap
you back in the seat!
You may want to install a new hose at this time.
You also MUST install an aftermarket boost gauge I choose autometer.The
reason for this is when you adjust your boost past stock it will just
peg at 2 bar on the factory gauge.
Cut the hose up by the engine place a small brass plumbing valve in the
area that you just cut. The valve will operate in this manner: Fully
closed it will allow stock vaccum pressure to travel through, open it
will bleed off some of that vaccum and raise boost. A word of caution
here open the valve a half a turn and check your boost pressure(floor it
in           3rd and note the stock setting) it will probably be about
10lbs. Do
this again with small adjustments noting the new boost readings. I have
chosen to go with about 17 lbs. This will be enough to blow by some of
the following stock cars: 84-95 corvette, 84-95 camaro, 84-96 mustangs,
etc. etc.
