I have to agree with Bill about the jammer. Unless it is some sort of
wonder device reverse engineered from alien technology you would need so
much power it would cause cancer clusters in your car.
I think until such time as someone rips off an EF-111 and crams their
trunk with a 1000lbs of electronics we will just have to keep driving
with our eyes open.

Steve,

I was a radar tech in the Marines, and I find it very unlikely that the
unit you
are describing works.  For the most part, radar is a line of site thing.
 No
shooting through mountains, and doubtful it would jam through your car
while
mounted on the floor like a cell phone.  If it did work, it would have
to be
mounted on your dash at least.  In any event, a friend of mine bought
one of
those jammers (different brand) for his car.  I was skeptical so called
up a
police buddy and went for a 'test'.  The jammer had no effect what so
ever on
the police radar, so my friend returned it for his money back.  There
are issues
of frequency and signal strength that the police radar takes into
consideration
when analyzing the signal return.  Your radar jammer would have to be
capable of
jamming X, K, and Ka bands which would require three seperate sets of
wave
generation electronics and three seperate sized waveguides with emitting
horns.
Police radars aren't a small radar detector sized unit because of the
waveguides
and horn necessary to emit a radar signal.  If your device doesn't have
this
hardware in it, (how do you squeeze that in a cell phone size?) I'd be
interested in knowing how they manage to emit a doppler wave.  I'm not
saying
it's impossible, but if it sounds to good to be true.......
