Adrien,

This option was available on the 1988 924S Special Edition.  It is the
Sport Option which has stiffer shocks, and 25mm (I believe...) front and
rear sway bars.  I have a '88 **4 series Product Information Workbook (a
book given to the sales force to familierize them with the product) that
gives an exact description.  When I get home I'll e-mail it to you.

This car was marketed as a performance not a luxury car.  All of the
power convienences were removed (power windows, locks, mirrors, antenna,
rear wiper) as well as the cassette holder rear of the shifter. It has
wider alloys on the rear, 15x7 vs 15x6 front, 944 style door guards,
rear stone deflectors, a unique interior of burgundy carpet and grey
with burgundy pinstriped flannel upholstery and was only available in
black.  It is 80 lbs lighter than a normal 924S, cost $900 more and is
faster.  Mine stickered for $27,200. Only 500 were to be built, however
I know of a person who's VIN # indicates their car is #531.

You e-mailed me awhile back regarding rim sizes, didn't you?

Take Care,
