Here's an update on my exercise in trying to re-glue the rear hatch
glass on my wife's 924 for those reading this thread...

I have found another adhesive which I am going to try, since I've been
unable to find the recommended epoxy. It's GOOP! Literally, GOOP Marine
Adhesive and Sealant (it comes in a bunch of variants, including
Carpenter's, Industrial, and Houshold...). I've tested a little bit of
it on the hatch (just squirting it into existing gaps) and it seems to
have the necessary adhesion power and flexibility for the job.
Previously, I'd tried 3M's Black Super Weatherstrip Adhesive, and found
it to be insufficient in both areas, as well as seeming to dry out once
on the car.

The glue comes in a 3.7 Fl. Oz. size, so I expect I'll need 2-3 tubes to
do the job comfortably. I got it for around $5 US a tube at Home Depot.
A little more expensive than the previous sealant, but still worth it if
it works. BTW, I should note that this sealant is clear in color, not
black. That isn't a concern for me, but may be for others. I do like the
way that no mixing of epoxy ingredients is necessary during application
(given the large amount necessary).

I hope to get moved into my new house at the end of next week, and will
then be re-gluing the hatch come the first possible moment (the car
squeaks worse than an old Camaro right now). I'll post the results of
this test to the list once I've completed it, let you know whether this
stuff is worth using or not...

On a side note, I finally got my Kerker racing seat installed
yesterday... The car doesn't handle any better, but it sure feels like
it does! It's a great improvement over the old, beat-up seats! Now I
just need to get it to the right angle (it's very upright) and replace
the steering wheel (the leather is coming apart in the wet weather) with
a MOMO wheel on a quick-disconnect hub (it's a tight squeeze getting in
and out of the seat right now), and we'll be all set!

Later...
