Mike,
 I have a 86 951 so some of this info may or may not apply to you. 
My gauge started to hover around 12, then about a week later it was at
11
I started to get a little concerned. However I ignored it thinking it
was the 
gauge going bad. Started the car one morning and it was hovering between
10 & 11
I made it to work with no problems (5 miles). On the return trip I new
that the gauge was correct it was at 10, my headlights started to dim at
idle. The engine started to run very rough, I had to turn off my
headlights to prevent it from stalling! 
Anyway if you see your gauge drop below 12 it is definately time to  
check things out. The good news here is it is probably 1 of 3 things:
battery, volt reg
or brushes. On the 86 951 the volt reg & brushes came in a handy
replaceble unit that 
took 5 minutes to replace (not counting the 4 hours it took me to remove
my alternator)it cost me about $36.00. My local Porsche mech wanted
several hundred.
