Claus,

There seems to be a lack of consensus on this server regarding the normal
operation of cooling fans, so I'll take this to see what PFolks think. A
switch to control the fans is not necessary if the rest of the circuit is
working correctly.  According to the Tech. Info. manual for the late '85,
when the switches in the rad. temp. sensor were changed, both fans work in
concert, operating at 2 speeds, and activated by the temp. switch and A/C. 
Both fans should come on after as hot track run, assuming the temp. switch
is working.  If not, the turning on the A/C should turn on both fans.  At
least this is what happens w/ my S2 after I tracked down the problem w/ a
Porsche mechanic and replaced the G10 relay box. (Neither one of us were
sure what should happen w/ normal operation) Before the replacement, only
one fan came on, regardless. After the fix, both come on together under all
conditions, and my S2 no longer has any cooling problems. 

Anyway, perhaps contingent on your model year, you shouldn't have to do
anything fancy to get both fans to come on at high engine temps.
