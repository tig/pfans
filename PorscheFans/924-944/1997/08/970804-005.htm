I also have a clicking relay in my 85.5 944na.  This relay is located
under the passenger side dash, just below and to the left of the
glovebox.  It connects two small hoses together.  This relay has been
intermittently clicking ever since I purchased the vehicle,
(approximately 1 =BD years ago).  Some days it will click continuously =
and
then it will not click for weeks.  I have found that turning the car =
off
and restarting has stopped the clicking.  Playing with the air control
switch also works.  I have no idea what this relay does.  Since I am
experiencing no real problems, I am not too concerned about it.  =
However
I would like to know what the heck this relay is supposed to do. =20
