 Hi, Jim,

The answer is obvious...

1) Make sure that your car insurance covers broken glass.
2) Arrange to have your windshield broken.
3) File claim, receive new windshield, use the damn foil base next =
time...

(No flames, please - only written in jest!)

|Lee,
|
|  According to the 944, 944 S2 & 944 Turbo Owner's Manual, concerning=20
|"Sekuriflex" windshields, "They must not have gummed labels put on=20
|it". They also say that no abrasive agents or dry methods should be=20
|used to clean the windshield. They state that only "normal drug store=20
|alcohol" should be used to clean very dirty windshields. Also, keep=20
|all "hard objects" such as jewerly or wristwatches etc, away from the=20
|plastic coating. Apparently, this coating is very fragile!
|  To mount any labels or stickers to the windshield a "foil base"=20
|must be applied to the windshield. What "foil base" we say??!! Well,=20
|according to the Manual, EVERY car has 3 of these "foil bases"=20
|included in the glove compartment. (You did say that you bought your=20
|car new, right? So I assume that you had them???) They go on to=20
|describe how to affix this "foil base" to the windshield with a=20
|mixture of liquid soap and distilled water. Then affix the=20
|label/sticker to the "foil base". To remove this, use this same=20
|solution to loosen the label/sticker or backing foil.  They also say=20
|that failure to use this method will result in damage to the=20
|Sekuriflex coating.=20
|  DAMN! WHY? I have a 91 951 with 3 stickers on it! One indicating the=20
|licence plate # on my car, one indicating when the inspection needs=20
|to be done, and one which shows my car is equipped with the  new type=20
|of catalytic converter, which allows me to drive around here in=20
|Germany when "Smog Alerts" are declared, instead of having to park=20
|it. (Except for driving to work, or going on vacation, I believe.)=20
|These are all required for US citizens who own/register cars and work =
for=20
|the Department of Defense here in Germany.
|   Now, when I bought my car from Porsche AG last year, there was no =
"foil=20
|base" in my glove box. AND, I obviously FAILED to read the Manual=20
|completely. (Actually, I did read it, but skipped what I considered=20
|the mundane stuff $$$.
|  Now, what to do?  I'm going to see my mechanic on Monday when he=20
|gets back from Urlaub (vacation). HOPEFULLY, he will have a solution.=20
|I was thinking that "Goo Gone" might work, but will wait until I talk=20
|to Herr Ollmann. UNLESS someone on this list has removed a sticker=20
|with no damage.
|  George B., any thoughts on this problem??!!

Subject: 951 shifter slop
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I remember a particular post regarding slop in the 5-speed stick for 
     944's.  Does anyone remember what amount of slop or free play is 
     "acceptable" for a shift-knob on a 951 transaxle?  I'm referring to 
     the amount of movement that one is able to produce while the car is 
     either in gear or in neutral.  I can presently move my shift knob in a 
     tight little square pattern, and I think the square has gotten bigger 
     recently but I'm not sure if it's just my imagination.  What are the 
     dimensions of the "square" pattern that the rest of you guys are able 
     to produce (i.e. Does the top of your knob make a 1" x 1" square, or a 
     3mm x 3mm square?)
     
     And if a shifter is too loose (worn?), what's the probable cause and 
     recommended fix?
     
     Thanks
     Ben
