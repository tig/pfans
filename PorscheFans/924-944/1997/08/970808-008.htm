I have a 1988 944 with 41K orig. miles.  Last summer the
A/C worked perfect however this summer it is dead.  All
indications of a functioning system are there, however no
cold air is present out of the vents.

I took the car to a local Porsche dealer and they told me
the condensor was bad and would cost $1000 to repair the
system!

Has anyone else had similar problems or any suggestions.
I am taking the car to another radiator shop that had done
a lot of work on Porsches to get a second opinion.

I priced the condensor for around $370 thru AutoAtlanta
whereas the dealer wants almost $600.  How hard would this
be to change for a somewhat mechanically inclined individual?
I have the shop manual set for the car.
