Hi Guys!

I installed Turbo S sloted rotors front and back with bilet aluminum 
adjusters on my stock suspension and wheels. The kit included 
modification to increase the pad contact surface area by 20 %. The 
brakes are AWESOME now!
I can lock my front wheels at 100 miles if I wanted to. If anybody  
likes to get more info about the brake package, please E-mail me direct.

I drive 87, black / black, 65000mi,  944 Turbo and will upgrade the engine this winter. I am 
considering two options - POWERHOUSE K 27 turbo, MAF, Chips with 
stroker kit or same as above without the stroker kit.
Should I go with the stroker kit ?

Clearly the stroked engine has got tons of torque and horsepower at 
low rpm compared 
with the 2.5 l version. From the DYNO charts however it is apparent 
that the 2.8 l power curve is almost flat from 4000 rpm to 5500 rpm. 
This may indicate that the car has big V8 feel , and maybe does not 
rev as eagerly to red line  as the 2.5 l verson. I love the feel of 
the power surge that comes with raising revs on 
my stock car  under boost . I would not want to loose this feel 
to the car just make it stronger.

Is somebody out there who did these mods before and can compare them? .
Would you do the stroker kit again if you had a choice? 
I only race my car occasionally on the track, no autocross, so I am 
not trying to build a competitive racer.

Thank you!

There is no substitute for experience.
