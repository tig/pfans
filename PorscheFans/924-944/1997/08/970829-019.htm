Folks,

Short story.  Several weeks ago i was out for a pleasure drive
at about 1:00 am.  I got onto my favorite 270 deg. freeway entrance
ramp and was about to liberate the throttle when I noticed a cruiser
behind me.  So i kept at the posted limited.  The cop cut inside of
me and blasted by at what I estimated 20mph over my speed.  He
continued accelerating onto the freeway and was out of sight in
several seconds.  No flashing light, no siren, NOT in pursuit.
Several minutes later I noticed a patrol car (same one?) pulling
onto the shoulder, shutting down his lights and engine to set up
a speed trap.  Charming, no?

I was really annoyed.  When I arrived home a few minutes later, I
called the city police department to issue a complaint, but of
course there's no one at the desk at that hour, and the guy had
whizzed by too fast to get the patrol car number.
