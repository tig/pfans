OK, I was trying to figure out a way to determine the frictional force
that tires can exert (don't ask).  I decided to brush up on friction in
general and found something interesting.  My physics book claims that one
of the empirical laws of friction is that the surface area of the
substance in contact with the other substance doesn't affect the
coefficient of friction (static or kinetic).

I'm having a tough time reconciling this with reality.

Don't people buy wider tires to get better traction?  Like, people who
would know what they're doing (presumably Porsche does)?  If surface area
doesn't affect the coefficient of friction, then why do wider tires grip
better?

I've been thinking about it, though, and could it have something to do
with the direction of the car's normal force during cornering (when one
side of the tire compresses)?

It's really got me confused.  The book is current as of '94 or something,
so I doubt it's one of those things that's changed with modern technology. 
(Actually, it has a pretty cool section on new race tires with
coefficients of static friction around 1.7 and 1.8.  I'm thinking that
those tires last for around five minutes.)
