Hi all:

I am finally driving my '82 931 after months of rebuilding.  Almost 
everything is working, but if you have any ideas about what's not:

1) The car stumbles harshly with any load over about 2800 rpm, sooner 
with greater load.  I have checked the boost press sensor (grounded it
), the throttle pos sensor (disconnected, woke up my neighbors with 
3000 rpm idle), and the timing at idle.  It almost feels like the 
ignition is cutting out completely.

2) The little "exciter wire" on the back of the alternator does not 
give any power to the alternator.  It's supposed to come on right 
after the starter turns over your car, then turn off (I think).  I 
also think it goes through the fuse panel, but I don't know where.  
Any ideas?

That's enough for now.  Please respond directly so I can try to fix it 
this weekend.  I'd already be driving the piss out of the car, but it 
has no AC and the windows are stuck up.  In Florida, that's not a good 
thing!

Thanks 

Dave
