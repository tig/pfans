Well, here it finally is, my 2nd 944 trevia quiz.  For those of you who
disliked my first quiz about 944 pressure regulator/no injector
fire--you don't have to read this.  For those of you who did--read on.
As before, I will give away two free oil filters to the first respondent
with the correct answer.  

Clutch pedal either does not disengage the clutch, or does so at the
very bottom of travel, making it hard to shift gears (possibly grind
them) or not being able to shift at all.  The clutch felt fine one day,
and not the next.

Checking the clutch wear spec.(measuring the release arm at the bell
housing), the dimensions are well within tolerances (18mm new to
34mmwear limit).

Clutch slave and master cylinders operate properly.

Remove clutch system--disc is good--no rubber hub tearing or chunking
(or broken/cracked springs turbo disc).  No warpage.

Pressure plate is good--no broken fingers, no warpage.

Throw-out brearing is good and intact.

Pilot bearing is good.

No trash has fallen into the clutch system from any source.

Input shaft is good (torque tube), turns freely, as well as no
transmission problems.

I have seen this problem before where an owner had a clutch replaced
somewhere only to get it back and still have a clutch problem, or had a
problem shortly after clutch replacement.

Good luck---let me know what you think.

Any of you guys racing your cars really need to know about this.
