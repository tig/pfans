 Probably your clutch. I would guess that something has come loose and=20
has made the clutch disk  unbalanced...

|Is my transaxel about to break????
|
|I have a 87 951, fitted with S engine
|It's very well chipped, and tuned. It's putts out
|325 HP on the wheel, and 358 HP on the engine.
|
|358 HP is mayby to much. I had to fitt a brand new new transmission
|with diff. locking, and i also had to put put 2 new driveaxel (from
|gearbox to wheel)
|
|So what may be bee the next???
|I think the transaxel is about to break. This is how the car behave:
|
|When the car is in neutral with the clutch is up, the whole car shakes, =

|espacially around 1.200 rpm, At higher RPM, you cant really feel it.
|But when you put the clutch down, still in neutral, the shaking
|disapears complete.
|When the car is cold, the shaking is not so bad.
|
|When you drive the car, it acts pretty normal, the problem is only as I
|described it.
|
|Does anywhone have any ideas or opinion, could it be the clutch??, it
|has done about 20k miles.
|
|Please let me hear from you guys over there, there ain't to many "real
|cars" over here.
|

|PS: Does anyone remember the chat about the pickup; I'ts actually sold
|from denmark, made in germany, and fitted=20
|to the danish marked, cause of the taxes. It's mostly the 928 the is
|made as a pick-up.=20
|If anyone whant more information, please let me know.
