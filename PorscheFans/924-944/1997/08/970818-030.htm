If you are speaking of the body side of the door brake, they are screwing
into square nuts which were tack welded during assembly. The constant
push-pull of the brake fails them.

I was successful in heating an open-ended wrench (7/16" throw-away works, I
think the nuts are 10mm) and bending it 90-degrees and going in through the
wire boot in the body.
