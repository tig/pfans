hey porschefans,

this one is for the 924 techies out there (or maybe just marv, the porshe
wizard)
ready, great.. fresh air blower fan in my 924 is out of service. called a few
places and almost had a coronary . $175.00 for a new one (big propeller
looking thing in the non a/c car). anyway i dont think this is an item i'd
want "used" on , since it looks to be a "project" to replace. but, can i
replace the motor with radio shack parts or similiar??
has anyone tried this?? i'm thinking its a simple electric motor ,  maybe
three speed?(mine has never worked so i dont know).  has anyone tried a
"substitute" from
another maker??
i hate to shell out that much on the unit unless i have too, but then again
winter is coming soon.  this year more than "trickle" heat would be nice...
any thoughts on this would be appreciated, especially by my toes and
fingers..
thanks,
eric (ericj001@aol.com)
