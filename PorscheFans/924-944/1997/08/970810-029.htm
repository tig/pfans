The back flow valve (this may not be the correct name) in your fuel pump is
bad. It is a small ball-check valve in the fuel line that keeps fuel from
draining out of the lines when the engine and pump are not running. When the
valve goes bad, the fuel pump has to pressurize the fuel line before it can
get gas to the injectors. Sometimes the car will start on the little bit of
fuel in the injectors and then stall, sometimes it has to be cranked a while
before it starts. As a test, try turning on the ignition but don't crank it
for about 30 seconds, then try starting it. If it starts right up, this is
your problem.

certain  southern state sent me the wrong pump!)
