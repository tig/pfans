Hi All,
        Back on July 9 there was a message from Tracy Meyer complaining
that he had run a left front Hoosier R3S02 down to the cords after a few
autocross runs. Tire pressure hot had been 42psi. If there were any posts=

with further comments on this problem, I missed them so would like to
reopen the subject.
        At the PCA Club Race at Putnam Park last month my brand new (less=

one short heat cylcle run the previous day) left front Hoosier R3S02 was
down to the cord after 10 laps. I had a DNF because of it which really ma=
de
me mad (not to mention the loss of the $180 for the tire with M&B). I
believe the pressure hot was also about 42psi which was what the Hoosier
tire guy at the track recommended. The other 3 tires were fine with very
accepable wear. Camber was set at -2.8 degrees and the Hoosier tire guy d=
id
pyrometer readings on these tires the previous day when I put them throug=
h
one heat cycle (7 laps) and declared the set up was good. BTW my car is a=
n
'89 951 which runs in E stock.
        In 5 years of club racing I've  consistently used BFG R-1s up to
this point and have never seen such severe wear in such a short track
session.  Has anybody else encountered this and more importantly does
anybody have any suggestions (other than to go back to R-1s)?
