Good points all, Anders, and they raise a lot of interesting questions!

So I guess what you're saying here is that the law books don't reflect
society's rules.  That begs a lot of questions.  So whose do they
reflect?  And should we be beholden to abide by them if they don't
reflect our (society's) rules?  A valid legal defense in any other
situation would be established prior practice, regardless of the rules. 
That is, an employee cannot be suddenly fired for breaking a condition
of employment if he/she has done so repeatedly in the past without
repercussion.

Policemen are human.  I think they make lots and lots of mistakes.  I
don't fault them for it, or expect them to be perfect, but I don't
consider them to be any better or worse than anybody else.

Is this like being pregnant (just a little)?  The difference is that
robbery, rape, and murder, (even if they could be performed
fractionally), cause harm to others.  The rationale for most people is
that their speeding does no harm to others, except raising the
probability of their losing control of their vehicle and creating an
unsafe circumstance which may cause harm to others...  No loss of
control, no harm.  Owning or carrying a firearm significantly increases
the risk to others in the household or around the carrier, yet you can
buy a permit for that (give the gov. a little money and he'll let you do
anything it seems).  Should there be permits for speeding?

I appreciate your point(s), but I don't share all of them.  Should I don
my flame-retardant suit?
