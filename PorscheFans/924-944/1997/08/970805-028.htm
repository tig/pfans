Hey,

Yes I agree on both points. You generally get what you pay for and It's =
only only worth what other's are willing to pay.  Haven't we just =
described a free market environment?

I think all us 944 owners feel our cars are worth a little more because =
they are great cars and sold for a lot of money when new.  Hey, $38,000 =
for a 944 Turbo was a LOT of money in 1987.  Unfortunately, expensive =
cars seem to depreciate a lot more than the median car.

For instance, look in any newspaper - you can get a *really nice* 4-5 =
year old Lexus LS or SC 400 for less than $25K (asking price).  Who =
knows what the cars actually sell for. These cars sold for well over =
$50K new and are about as good quality wise as cars get, IMHO.

Hey, it's worth what you think it's worth.
