It has been a very rough 3 days, haven't been able to post at all. I even
knew the answer to the first trivia question, why, because it happened to me
and ended up costing me a ton of $$ to get fixed. But down to the real
business at hand....

I picked up some seats this weekend, Momo Rookie and T-Bar and I need to
mount them. While I am worried about weight, I don't want to spend a ton of
$$ on aluminum mounts ect. Does anyone have experience mounting these seats
in a 951? I would like to use sliders, as there is a "chance" someone else
may drive the car. OG Racing sells kits but they need measurments to see if
theirs would work and the seats are on Long Island and I'm in Jersey.

Black Sport seats for sale, make offer. Very good condition. I have a range
of what they go for, but I'm not looking to be a whore about it.
