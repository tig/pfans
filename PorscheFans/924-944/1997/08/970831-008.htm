Rich,

The exact quote is:

" Sports Suspension (M030).  This package for the 924S includes larger
(25.5mm front/18mm rear) anti-roll bars of the 944 models as well as
sports shock absorbers."

My book only indicates that there were to be 500.  But it does not say
if these were production numbers or import numbers. It also says that
they were to be Satin black Metallic.  Mine is just black.  I have
contacted Porsche North America but they could only give me total
production numbers all 924S's for the year.  They did not have a break
down.  They gave me an address to write to at Porsche in Germany.  Mike
Leuty's VIN indicates he has #588.  So many more were built beyond the
500 indicated.  Mine is #267.  Your #531, right?

Glen said you and he had a great time in Denver.  He says you barely
beat him.  I'm from Kansas City and only moved here 6 months ago.  My
main office is there, but I cannot think of a good enough excuse to
visit fly back in mid September to come and see you guys in action at
Heartland Park.  Glen says there are five Special Editions signed up.
He hopes to get a group shot.  I'd like to get into Autocrossing
myself.  I'm having trouble finding people here to learn about it and
get started, however.  Looks like a  sh** load of fun!!!

You're correct, technically it is not faster than the other 924S's
produced that year, however it is about 80lbs lighter without all of the
conviences and therefore would be slightly faster in the straights ;-)

Take care and good luck in Topeka,

BTW,  Your going to let a Toyota beat you!!!??? ;-)
