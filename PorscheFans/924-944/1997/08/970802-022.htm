I guess many of you (especially those with older cars) have this problem, as
I hear it is common - dashboard creaks when turning, going over bumps, etc.
My 924 developed this nasty sound on both sides of the dashboard over the
last couple of months. The solution turned out to be very simple. The noise
was not coming from the dashboard itself (not most of it anyway), but the
aluminium "thing" (in lack of a better word) under the lower edge of the
windshield. Pop the hood, and you will see it. If your dashboard makes rude
sounds, try pushing and pulling this aluminium strip, and see if it makes
any sound. If it does, like mine did, squirt generous amounts of lubricant
(I used WD-40) between the aluminium and the windshield. I also loosened and
tightened the screws holding it in place, just in case. Quick fix, problem
solved.

But - like I said, mine had creaking sounds on both sides of the dashboard,
left and right. On the right side, the solution was the above. On the left
side, I merely removed and reinserted the windshield wiper motor cover and
the noise was gone. I love it when that happens.

If this doesn't help, maybe the noise is coming from inside. You could
probably try lubricating the dashboard where it meets the windshield. I
don't think WD-40 is good for the dash though.

One noise down, three to go. Which brings me to my question:



Does anyone know why my 924 squeaks from the back (rear right) when driving
on bumpy roads? I read something in Auto Atlanta's catalog about squeaking
suspension bushings - could this be it? Quote:

"They [Weltmeister bushings] have a bearing-like action yet do not squeak
like delrin or teflon. As a result, you will not get strange looks at stop
lights from the girl in the BMW as she looks down her nose at the squeaky
Porsche!"

What can I lubricate to stop this embarrasing noise? I do think it is
something in the suspension. It is definitely coming from the outside, since
it echoes off walls and comes back embarassingly loud.. I didn't realize it
was this loud until today, when driving without music for a change.
