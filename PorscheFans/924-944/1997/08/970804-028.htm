Obviously, you are not a deliberate cheater (or the world's dumbest!).
But I suspect your next Parade may not be so trouble-free now that the
cat is out of the bag... And I'll pay particular attention to the
apparent loss of fluids from any of my competitors from now on. <g>

I remember the days of the 962s in IMSA racing (not really THAT long ago
but I'm feeling old today...). One of the big speed tricks was to pack
the intercooler area with ice cubes. There was a swath of cubes ejected
from the car whenever they went around a corner.
