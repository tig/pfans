<<Has anyone on this list ever swapped out their rear diff for a LSD?>>

Yep, I did it to my '84 944 when I broke the pinion gear at a Pro Solo.
It can be done single-handed. The Haynes manual has the setp-by-step
directions which I followed. It took me 7 or 8 hours by myself going
very slowly so I wouldn't screw up.

I found I needed a real shop jack to lift the transaxle into place
instead of my downsized type you can find at Sears. But with two people,
you could probably do it. The problem is one of balance.

The other problem I had was with the CV joints. Use Red Loctite on the
bolt ends and make sure the bolts and the hub the bolts attach to are
COMPLETELY free of grease. (Easier said than done, believe me...) You
will also need a 12-pt 8mm socket for the CV bolts.

I hope you weren't looking for advice on how to install a LSD in an
existing transaxle. For that, I'd send it to someone who really knows
what they are doing and who has all the proper tools, such as Kevin
Gross on this list. That's not backyard stuff.
