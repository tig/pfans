eloquently stated:

>Is this a german word for _ ? TIA

Don't think so.  I believe it originally came from the "Carrera Pan
Americana," which was informally known as the Pan American Road Race.
This race was about 2500 miles [give or take a few hundred :-)] through
Mexico to Panama.  One year it started in Mexico City and ran south, the
next it ran north.  The race ran for several years in the 50s and in fact
my father raced in it in a 1954 Corvette!  He has some pretty interesting
stories to tell about the Mexican banditos, racing against Phil Hill, =
etc.
Porsche had some cars entered one year and in honor of the race they took
the Carrera name to signify a performance car.  The name doesn't have the
special distinction it once had, but it is still cool sounding as far as
I'm concerned!
