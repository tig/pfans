Jerry,
 What mods if any have you done?
Are you running stock boost levels? You have the k27 as a stock unit
I think they are capable of 17-20 lbs. Jack up the boost to 17 lbs in
the 89 s and see how well the beemer does at the next event. There is no
reality in racing just another way to justify the next mod.
