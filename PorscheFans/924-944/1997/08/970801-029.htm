re your query:    
     Has anyone here converted their headlight washers to an intercooler 
     sprayer? It seems it would be a relatively easy job. I'm just 
     wondering if the performance gains are worth it. Cooler charge air is 
     truly cost-free horsepower, and if you can get it without a 
     boost-sapping  (or wallet-sapping) larger intercooler, then its even 
     better. 
     
    Here in San Diego, Steve Livelsberger was the first to use the windshield
washer for his intercooler. He rigged a "throttle body" switch to turn on the
windshield washer  motor only when the throttle was wide open. This is a
small intermitant normally open switch that he placed near the throttle body
so that a piece of the throttle body closed the switch when the throttle is
wide open. He then wired this from the battery to a fuse to the switch to the
washer motor. This is on top, very visable and easy to access and can run for
long periods without burning up. the Headlight washer is designed as a high
output hi pressure pump for shorter bursts of water. The output of the pump
then is plumbed to an irrigation sprayer in front of the intercooler. The
extra cooling at full throttle produces more cooling and more air to the
cylinders which is measured by the air mass sensor. This provides the correct
fuel. The cooling pevents knock so the computer doesn't activate the waste
gate. This has resulted in dependaboe  power for autocross and time trial
use. Watch for longer run sessions at time trials which may exhaust the
capacity of the washer tank. Adjusting the spray rate of the sprayer could
help here. Steve also noted that with the extra power came extra need for
brake cooling. He plumbed additional sprayers into the "cool brake" ducts
that he (and all the other serious water pumpers in San Diego use for brake
cooling). This sprays water in the brake cooling lines when the gas is
floored. The air is ducted only into the center of the hubs and into the
cooling vents of the discs. I have copied just this portion of the
instalation for my NA car with excellent results. No one has warped a rotor
doing this, and the brake bleeding drill during lunch break is over. I have
tested my front rotor temperatgures ater a single autcross run session (~6
laps of 1-1.5  miles each with lots of braking) and find the rotors to be
~450 degrees without water sprayers, and ~250 with the sprayers. The rears
(with backing plates removed) are consistant at ~250. The wheels get a little
dirtier with some of the overspray washing brake dust onto them which then
bakes on a little. I just wash them after each event. 

I found that I had to fill the tank up after each 25 minute run session at
Laguna Seca.
Non Porsche pumps that others have tried only last about two run sessions
before they burn up. 
You will also need a "Normally closed solanoid" between the pump and the
plumbing to prevent the water from siphoning to the low point which is in the
brake ducts. The 12v ones used on water injectors used in some older turbos
work well. Dave Turner of dave turner motor sports (advertizes in Pano) got
me one several years ago.
