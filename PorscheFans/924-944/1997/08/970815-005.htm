Thanks Marv.......certainly it didn't go off despite revving engine
etc......only went out after turning off/on etc......anyone know if once
triggered it's necessary to reset ? IanS

If your oil level is a bit low, parking on a grade, or short stops and
starts where the oil has not fully returned to the oil pan can trigger
the "Check Oil" lamp.

I think it is a one time event that trips the light on and the car must
be turned off to reset the lamp.

On my cars it typically seems to trip if the oil level drops by about 1/3
quart.
