Since acquiring my '86 951 last month, I have been trying to purchase all of
the technical information that I will need to maintain this car.  I purchased
the Haynes manual, of course, and am now on a waiting list for the repair
manuals . . . number 12,431 in line, I think, although the Turbo manual is in
transit.  I am taking extra vitamines in the hope of living long enough to
see them.  

I also purchased the Illustrated Parts Catalog, 944, 1985/2-88, WET 614 300.
 When I received it I found that it consists of exploded drawings without
part numbers.  I found that part number pages are not available!  (Who's
bright idea?)  I purchased the microfiche, number WET 614 321 and found a
company in Los Angeles that can provide printed pages for thirty-five cents
each, about $90.00.  Along with the $50 for the catalog, this parts manual is
expensive,

I thought that I would first ask whether anyone has already done this?   I
will gladly purchase a set from that person.  Secondly, is anyone interested
in a copy?  The cost will be reduced since I would take the originals to a
copy shop and have several sets made.
