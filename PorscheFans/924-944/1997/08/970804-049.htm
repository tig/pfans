Here's all the info you want to know about my Porsche 924(931)Turbo!

pictures at http://www.frontiernet.net/~volvoic

First, the price is $7500.  Lowered from $9500, which was lowered from 
$10,000, which was lowered from $12,000.
If you think that this car is only worth $2500,  then I suggest 
that you go shop for a $2500 Porsche.  :)    The bodywork and rims alone 
are worth $10,000!

REASON FOR SELLING: Too many toys.   :(

power windows
heater power mirrors
cross-drilled performance front rotors
new KKK turbo has 17k on it
16" wide profile michelin XGT-V sport tires
Gotti rims (originally $500 each!)
Holbert wide stance 'GTR' body, complete with stationary headlights 
  and Bosch driving lights.  Front fenders have rear vent sills, unique.
new water pump
new fuel pump
turbo runs at a maximum pressure of 14psi.
real lamb skin seat covers
rear seat removed during re-upholstery, fire extinguisher bracket in its place
Koni shocks
stainless steel braided brake hoses
Momo steering wheel

The car is driven in dry weather only.  It will require new front tyres
soon, alongside a new owner.  :)
