Thanks to all who replied to my query re: the H4 replacement.  Everyone
stated there is a vast improvement over the standard US sealed beams, even
with the federally mandated 55/65 watt bulbs.  This has to do with the
projected light pattern (low and broad, then rises on the periphery to
illuminate the roadside).  The light is 'whiter' and less yellow. Some
folks also mentioned these are illegal to use on US roads (sold for off
road use only).  I think a catalog or two mentions this as well.  No one
stated they had any problems with oncoming traffic flashing them. 

I don't think anyone need worry, if they are using the legal wattage 
bulbs, as I doubt any police officer would ticket someone who presented 
them with an H4 bulb stamped 55/65w from the back of the headlight.

Several months ago, I was being flashed (stock sealed beams) and I
wondered why, since the output from the stock fog lights is so pathetic. 
I discovered the headlight aim was way off.. the beams were too high.  I
readjusted them to spec.  Alas, I mislaid my Haynes manual, so I can't
remember if there is a procedure there.  It involves applying tape to a
wall with particular dimensions, parking the car a measured distance from
the wall, then checking the aim by seeing where the brightest points of
light fall on the taped marks..  One can also get a device that attaches
to the front of the beam to do the check, as well.  It has a spirit level
that is centered when the aim is correct.
