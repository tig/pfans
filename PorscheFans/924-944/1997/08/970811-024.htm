I am due to have my cam timing belt/water pump belts adjusted.  From what
I understand, I need a special tool available only from Porsche.  Now, I
can have the dealer adjust it but I would rather do it myself.  The only
problem is I don't want to mess it up the first time and destroy my
engine. Is there someone anyone on the list knows near the Denver area(I
don't mind a few hour drive) that can show me how to do it properly?  I am
planning on purchasing the adjustment tool, any leads on where to get
would help also(so far places like automotion and the like have been
unhelpful). Any help at all on this subject would be greatly apperciated. 
Much thanks.  Feel free to respond directly if you wish.
