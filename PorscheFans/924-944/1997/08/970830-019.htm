 Well, you people have done it now. All this 951(S) talk has forced my =
hand. So now I`m on the hunt for a 951(1 month after the purchase of my =
85.5 N/A). I absolutely love driving the 944, when I can peel my wife =
out of the drivers seat. If there is anyone in the Toronto Ontario area =
who has a 951(`86 - `87) for sale let me know. Even better, if for some =
reason you want to sell your 951, but still have a 944, and take in some =
cash, lets deal. My 85.5 is in excellent condition with service records =
and some interesting options. Even if you want a confirmed deal now and =
make the exchange in the spring, we can work it out. Regards to all who =
have led me to this decision.



Mark Selkirk.
