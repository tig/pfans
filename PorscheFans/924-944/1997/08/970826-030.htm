Hi folks, I'm back,!   

Saw on the list the other day that some individual complained about
being caught by the police in his red Porsche.

While I certainly is sympathetic about that individuals plight, I'll
like to add my 2 c on this issue (wich is very close to my heart, now
when I also am a Honoray Police Detective in Cambridge, Ohio -  thanks
to Rick..)

There are som really really strange things when comparing speeding to
other crimes.

Before anybody screams in agony "if speeding is a crime - whats murder,
then", let us just calmly accept that a crime is a recognized deviation
from rules of the society as they are described in the lawbook. There
are minor crimes and more serious crimes, but the principle is clear, if
it's against the law - it may be a crime. The punishment usually relates
to the crime.           

Most (if not all) drivers accept that not following the traffic rules is
dangerous enough to warrant a punishment (a ticket), in some cases loss
of the right to drive on public roads and in the extreme cases, also
loss of freedom.                                                        

You probably understand that I am rather sympathetic to traffic rules,
by now...

Now to my observation:

It seems that the police never (well, almost never) make any mistakes
when catching speeders. Speeders very seldom, if ever, deny the fact
that the were speeding - at the most they argue the measured speed. 
Nobody is ever ashamed of being speeding either, it is clearly outside
of most societys informal and formal rules, that governs most of
ordinary peoples law abidance (sp?).         

So, never we hear "I didn't do it" - instead we hear "Ok, I did it, but
I think it shouldn't really count" or "OK, but it was only a little" or
"OK, I did it, but surely there has to be more important things for you
to do". 

Why on all earth is it OK to speed (a little), but not OK to rob (just a
little), rape (just a little) or murder (only a little)? 

And just think about the reactions when, accused for some other crime
than speeding, you defend your self with: 
"Ah, there was nobody around, so I didn't think it would hurt" 
or: 
"I have a much better judgment (read: car) than most people, so I can
break some laws without doing any harm" 
or, best of all:
"Why me, when lots of others go free"

If this is going too esotheric for some of you, don't mind. 

I just want to point out that speeding, and getting caught is not an
really an error of the police who nails you. He (or she) is just doing
his/her job, no more (but no less, either).     

Anyone speeding, should really ask himself just the simple question: 

Will I, a grown-up, with full control of my right foot, be able to take
the responsibility for my actions today, even if that means getting
caught by some zealous police officer, maybe with an ulcer and a an urge
to at least get somebody on this lousy shift - and in that case, am I to
accept the potential, but unlikely outcome of my descision to drive to
my hearts desire?        

Depending on that answer, drive accordingly! 

When caught, please don't come whining about police harassment and ask
for sympathy. Be a Man (or Woman), pay up and act happy. 

Face it, Porsche fellows and habitual speeders, the guy that didn't see
'them' first may not really done that good of a job looking out,
anyway...

Yours, not completely seriously, but mostly truly:

Anders Svensson, ex sailor and now recommissioning the the red police
magnet... and if they get me - I sure won't tell...
