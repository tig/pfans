I'm not sure but I don't think they use the same ground wire looking at the 
schematics.  If you've looked at the wiring diagram, you must have the 
manuals.  I think it is the last page of each set which shows the location of 
various components including the ground points.  There is a drawing 
(isometric?  It's been a long time since drafting class) which details 
location of all ground points using a 3d grid.

MP IV is on the front driver side of the car.  If you open the hood and 
look down behind the headlight (it may help to raise the headlights) you 
should see a bolt going into the frame with a bunch of ground wires (3?) 
attached.  All grounds on this car are brown I believe (Euro ground 
colour).

I was just poking around there yesterday looking for my OEM horns.  
You seen them?
