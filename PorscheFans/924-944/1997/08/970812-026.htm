Gary,
     I haven't had this problem yet, but here is a posting I saved a while ago 
that may help.
 
Good Luck,
          Ezra

Subject: Glove box lid retainers

G'day gang,

when the second plastic clip broke in my '86 944 I looked long and hard at
the design and decided I could do better. This was also after the shock
dealer price in Oz of over $1000.00 for a complete door with not necessarily
the same colour.
I got a small sheet of 1/32" flat steel, cut it out in the shape of a hook
and then bent the end to screw into the two small (philips head screw)
retained holes above and below the slot and just twisted the "in dash" end
to suit. Works a charm and you only need one and some black matt paint
finishes the job.

       |<---->|  distance from hook base to centre of hook = 3cm
            -----               -
          /        \            /\

This is a rough stick drawing off the real thing. I tried to scan it with
little success if you have one hook intact then draw this and reproduce on
paper. I have it available as a Bitmap image, so ask if you need!
You can remove the inner felt lid lining with about a dosen philips head
countersunk screws and then trim the broken plastic hook until flush with
the rest of the lid.
Next bend your hook's base and drill two holes for the just removed
countersunk screws.
Feed the new hook through the felt lining and screw the lining back through
the new metal hook. I know it all sounds like broken English which it is,
but for a little labour and patience you can repair the dreaded broken glove
box lid catch.
