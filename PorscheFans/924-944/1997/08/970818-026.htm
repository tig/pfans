Allen,
From your description of the noise, it sounds to me like 1 or more broken or 
missing exhaust manifold studs, or possibly some other form of exhaust leak.
My Audi is doing exactly what you describe at the moment, for that reason.
Every time an exhaust valve opens, you get a "clack" noise. The problem comes 
and goes, louder and softer, dependent on temperature etc. I've noticed it
Gets really loud after the car is hot, switched off for a few minutes, then 
restarted.

If this is the problem, it shouldn't do any harm to drive the car. BTW, this 
problem
Is often misdiagnosed as a collapsed lifter.

Too bad about the rape...

>>Stuff deleted...

Anyway, the noise is still there.  It comes and goes.  It is light at
times and very loud at others.  It's not a deep knock, but more of a
clacking or rapping.  I don't know what a bad lifter sounds like, but
the owner of the shop thought it was a lifter before he raped me.  If
it's a bad lifter, is it going to do extensive damage if I drive the car
to work?  How about a drive 6 hours to Toronto?
