Whatever anyone spends for oil, whether it's a buck 29 or four bucks a
quart... it's still cheap.  $24 every 3000 miles for Mobil 1 synthetic
isn't exactly breaking the bank.

Also, the factory service interval for oil is more than twice your 3000
mile interval.  I don't think you can hurt anything by going the
recommended change intervals if the car is driven normally and not
tracked.  I've used Mobil 1 in my '84 Audi 5000 since it was new and in
169,000 miles it hasn't used any oil in between changes... and I've gone
as far as 12,000 between them.  Same for my '92 Civic Si.  No oil use in
96,000 with routine changes at 5-7K.

Now, for a Porsche, I'd ere on the side of conservative, especially in a
turbo.  My son's 951 gets a change of Mobil 1 15w50 every 3000.  It
probably doesn't need it that often, but at $8 per month it's cheap
insurance.  YMMV.
