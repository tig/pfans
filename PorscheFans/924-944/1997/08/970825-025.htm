I enjoyed your article on the shock change from hell and it amused me
greatly as I had just started at 8:00 and finished changing shocks on a
944 this morning so I could be sure and have it for the customer by his
9:30 dentist appointment...as long as I got my coffee break in there
somewhere...and spent time on the Snap-On tool truck looking at their
newest pneumatic spring compressor...and--oh yeah,--answering my e-mail.

Just kidding...your article was amusing...and some jobs are very
difficult the first time...(if you should live so long as to become
crazy enough to do the shock change again)...you will find the second
time to be very easy...well, almost very easy.

One tip...buy a cheap 22MM socket and weld a handle onto it or a large
nut on top of it to hold with a wrench and you have a nifty tool to
tighten the strut nut while you insert your allen wrench through the top
of the socket.

Best wishes...and I enjoyed your article.
