Claus,

At the risk of sounding condescending, I cannot understand why you 
would even think of calling State Farm back.  So you got your other 
policies from them.  Who cares?  The insurance market is huge, and 
competition is healthy.

I remember at one point SF wouldn't even insure motorcycles.  I 
certainly don't think it's fair for them to take advantage of us or 
refuse to insure us because THEY have decided we are unacceptable 
risks.  

Don't let them do that to you!

Dave
