I would exactly agree.  I made this statement in response to another 
comment about the 944 versus the 944 Turbo.  If you pull your owners 
manual and look at the Full-Power and Acceleration Curves for all three 
vehicle you will see that this is indeed the case.  It is the relative 
difference of power that provides this illusion.

One more factor.  All three types of 944 have different gear and drive 
ratios.  The 944S is geared lower and the 944 Turbo is geared higher than 
the 944.  For the Turbo this affects the shift point at 60 mph, that is, 
you can get to 60 mph in second gear with the Turbo, but the 944 and the 
944S need third gear to complete the job.
