I'll check that out - but the engine develops a pretty good amount of torque (normal amount) right up to 2k. Remember - it's a 944 NA, it does develop good low end torque!!  I seem to remember that some one said there is a 'limp home' mode to these things. It this true and does my description match it?
The cut off of power is so clean and abrupt I thought it was spark but the tach still reads true engine speed. In other cars I've worked on the tach reads 0 when there is no spark, is this the same for the 944? So I guess it could be fuel pressure but I can't belive that the fuel pressure can be regulated that tightly as to cut of the engine at the same RAM regardless of load.

To answer Brent's questions - the fuel filter is only 3 months old. I think that a clogged fuel filter would be load dependent not RPM dependent. Other question - I got the front end repainted from the windshield forward. Also did some very minor repair to a 'parking lot' scratch and minor dent. They also repainted the mirrors and the driver side rocker panel (paint had worn through). Total cost $625.! I made the job easier for them by removing the bumper, all lights, the Porsche crest, stone shields (fun) and the windshield washer jets. This left no masking which is where repaints often look bad. It also makes it easier to do a good buff job.

So now I have a great looking car that I can't show off!!
