I like BMWs , I think every housewife should have one.
There are some problems with the 2 door E30 series cars though. The road
footprint is close to square and the M3 is worse because of the wider
track. This leads to a tendency to oversteer and spin. The problem was
addressed in the M325 and M3 M-technic suspension by dialing a lot of
negative camber. This has the effect of eating tires. Honda did the same
thing to the NSX to make it stay on the road. Customers complained about
the tires only lasting 5k miles.
The ONLY body panel that is common with the other 3 series cars was the
bonnet. If you crash this car your insurance company will still be
laughing at you when your grandkids come to them to insure their
electric cars in 50 years time.
The four pot M3 engine was a race engine that BMW designed back in the
sixties. This unit has seen a lot of duty over the years from F1 turbo
to touring cars, anything from 2.3 lt and 200 BHP to 1.5 lt and 1100
BHP. In 2.5 lt touring class racing in the late '80s it was making ~375
BHP at 8000RPM. This was very expensive horse power. It is still used in
2 lt form around the world for touring car class racing. If I want 375
BHP I can do it and still have change from 2k. And not have to worry
about engine life measured in hours.
I have not driven a M3 but I have been a passenger in a well driven one.
I have driven a M325. I don't think we should be arguing about its
legitimacy as a sports car but if you would buy one with your own money.
I had the option, I also looked at a number of other vehicles before
choosing  my 951. I bought my 951 because it has all the goodies
straight out of the box. 250 HP, BIG brakes, suspension etc., plus all
of the luxury items too. I have the peace of mind in knowing that if it
has got a BMW badge on it the very best it can do is keep up.

Richard.
