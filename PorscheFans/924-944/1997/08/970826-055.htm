Finally I'm getting to all the small fix-up items on my '89 S2. The 911 is still 
running badly and so far I haven't figured it out..

Decided to fix the outside keyed hatch release this weekend. The hatch has always 
popped open fron inside, but the key has never worked. I took out the carpet to get 
to the latch, and removed the wire harness with the microswitch attached to it. The 
key trips the microswitch, there is no mechanical linkage.  The switch part # is 
944.624.030.00. I don't now if this is the number for the entire unit or not. The 
wires are bonded into the switch, so it's probably a single unit !!!  Wanting to fix 
it RIGHT NOW ( and save some $$$ ),  I cut the wires off and took the switch down to 
my local electical supply store. They matched up a new microswitch for $4.50, and I 
attached it to the original harness. Works like a charm... Another success.. Now if 
I could just get the luggage cover to retract !!!!!

Hope this helps somebody !!!
