I enjoyed your comments about your preferences of synthetic oil over fossil
oils.  I surely agree that a synthetic is best for a turbo, but we'll have to
agree to disagree about the manufacturer's recommendations on oil change
schedules.  Manufacturers would like the perspective buyer to think their
vehicles are virtually "maintenance free".  In my opinion, I think they tend
to strech out their recommended oil change schedules too far.  Lets face it,
they are trying to sell you on the low maintenance features of their vehicle.
 I'm not an expert in the petroleum field at all, but I have seen studies
that show that the "additive packages" in fossil oils have been pretty much
worn out by 4000mi.   Don't forget the other benefit I mentioned in a 3000mi.
oil change-----frequent quality time spent under the vehicle ( checking for
fluid leaks, worn hoses, soft bushings,etc.)
