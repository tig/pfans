I think you speak german. If true, buy a paper called "Sperrmuell"
(weekly) or "KFZ-Sperrmuell" (monthly). Best is to try
http.//www.sperrmuell.de. There were diffrent interesting offers. For
example:
Porsche 944 Turbo, cabrio (convertible), 250 PS (hp), 1991, 92tkm (about
58 kmiles), black, black leather, AC ..... 19.900 DM (about 11.500 $).
(31/7/97)
Porsche 944 Turbo S, 250 PS, 120tkm, 1988, taubenblau, ...... 15.900 DM
(about 8500 $)            (24/7/97)
Porsche 944 Turbo, 220 hp, 1986, yellow, 140tkm,  8.500DM (4500$)..
(31/7/97)

There is no "formula". It depends where the car is located, mileage.....
its individual.

For newer cars there is an list called "Schwacke Liste"
(http.//193.73.251.119/cgi-bin/cgi-inf2)
(Germany) and in USA there is a thing called Kelly Blue book
(http.//www.kbb.com).
