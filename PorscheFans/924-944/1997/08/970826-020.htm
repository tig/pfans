i am really needing some help here.  i am sure that whatever i did yesterday
the car is not moving and i have this bad feeling that it might be a while.
my guess is that the driveshaft is no longer connected to the diff.  i know
that when i turn onw hub the other does not move where before when i turned
one the other moved the opposite direction.  i could just take it apart i
suppose but i want to be sure that is the problem first.  in addition i need
much advice as to how to take it apart because i have never done so before.
i guess the real question is how much money and should i go ahead and fire
up the 'stang cuz its gonna be a while???  i just hope i am not forced to
sell but i cannot continue to replace things

.
