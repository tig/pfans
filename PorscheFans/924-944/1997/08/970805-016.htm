Obviously a lot has to do with condition, miles, model and options, but....

I've seen N/A 44s from $3,500 to $16,000 (US), with an average price (if
there is such a thing) for a nice car from $7,500 to $12,000 (US). I follow
several publications closely for average values because I've sunk so much
dough in mine, I wanna know what I'll be able to get back out of it.
(surprise/YIKES!)

I'll say this, I believe that now, the 44's are under valued (as opposed to
911's) Perhaps they will come up a little, down the road. (no pun intended)

The deal is this though, unless you're buying it from your Dad or your
uncle...you're getting (if you do all the respective checks...) what you pay
for.

Can you get an 87 with 90K for 7 grand...yeah sure. Are you gunna dump
another 5 or 6 grand??? If you want it "right"...most likely.

I beg you...(as just coming off the same experience, and I've had three sweet
ones)
spend a little extra and get the real deal. (unless you are a great wrench
and have a family member in the parts biz.) And even then...BE READY TO SPEND
THE BUCKS. I hate to piss in Weaties, but let's call a spade a spade. Sure
you can drive a performance car for what you would buy a new Hyundai for, but
you're gunna go for the cash to keep her on the road.

Let the flames begin!
