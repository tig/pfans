I purchased a Brevarra seat from Century (has a nifty 5 point harness - sort
of) for the back seat of my 951 and it fits very well.  I did have a problem in
attaching it so that it would not tip forward under braking however.  I solved
the problem by running seat belt fabric through the hole in the top of the
seat, then underneath the hatch roller assembly (sun cover) and then I
connected it to the bolt hole under the carpeting in the hatch.  Sturdy as can
be and very safe.  Wish I had a way to quickly remove it however.  The way it
is set-up now requires a socket wrench to remove.  If only I could add a quick
release mechanism somehow.

Is there a method to convert my lap only belt in the back seat to a
lap/shoulder belt configuration?  My 5 year old sits back there frequently and
I would feel better if she was secured a little better.  My wife will not let
her sit in the front with all the inaccurate media attention focused on airbags
and little kids.
