Hello Everybody,

It seems that the only time you guys (gals) hear from me, I need info on
a problem I'm having with the 944.  One day, I'll contribute (I'm still
learning)  Anyway ....

Got a problem -- my car, after warming up, idles a little rough.  When
good and warm, it idles around 840 rpms.  Now, (for the last few
weeks -- hoping it would go away) it jumps between no lower than 800
to no more than 900 (i.e., searching).  It never stalls but the engine
becomes a little rougher at 800 and sounds like it wants too,

I don't believe it is the idle speed controller because it starts up right
away in the morning and sits at 1000rpms purring like a kitten (I had a
problem with the idle before - it wouldn't maintain idle when cold - and it
was fixed when the CO , which was way off, was adjusted to the
proper setting).

I know that the Oxygen sensor, once warmed takes over (or works
with the ISC) to maintain correct air/fuel mixture.  Could it be this?  Or,
am I way off base and it could be the ISC or something entirely
different?

I'm pretty handy with a Digital Multimeter and can read schematics/wire
diagrams  pretty well, so if there are a few thing that I can  try (take
some resistance, voltage, current measurements etc,,,) please let me
know.

Another note,  I sent a thread last week concerning my fresh air blower
conking out on me while I had the AC on.  Well, with the help and
knowledge of George B., I removed the resistor assembly above the air
blower, looked under a microscope and cleaned.  I then checked the
overheating safety contacts  (which are to open up around 110C, thus
opens the resistor network) and by heating the assembly with a hot air
gun, found them to open around 110C (pretty neat).  Put it back in the
car and works fine.  Hopefully, it was only dirty contacts on the resistor
assembly that made the air blower stop.  If it happens again, I think I may
have to look somewhere else....

Appreciate any  input of advice!

Thanks
