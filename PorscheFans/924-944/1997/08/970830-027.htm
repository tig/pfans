For those of you who are without the eyebolt for towing, the part number =
is
95172210100, Towing eye, list $17.50, PCA discount $14.88.  May I say "A
pox on the scumbag that lifted mine at the dealership".  I think these on=
ly
fit the 944 turbos and S2s.  If you do not have one, there is a good chan=
ce
you will need one. =


Bubba, the tow truck driver, has been known to hook a variety of breakabl=
es
trying to pull 944s onto his flatbed.  A friend had his 944 pulled on by
the A arms.  It didn't appear to damage the A arms but did leave a nice
scrape on the bottom of his urethane nose.  Naturally the tow company
claimed it was already scraped.  Never trust a tow driver who has more ha=
ir
growing on the end of his nose than most of us have on our heads. =


For the new list members, your Porsche dealer has the 924-944-928 parts
manual, #PNA000147A, for under $10.  It has exploded drawings and some go=
od
tech tips.  Don't leave home without it.

For the tool nuts, you can join the Craftsman Club for free,
1(800)682-8691.  They send out flyers announcing Club only sales.  During=

their recent sale, all wrench sets were 20% off.  Needless to say I went
nuts, shorty combination wrenches, deep offset boxend, 1/4" drive metric,=

etc.  I filled the gaps in my tool box so now I need a crane to lift it. =

The right tools really do make it easier to work on the P car.  Not that
any of us ever have to do that.
