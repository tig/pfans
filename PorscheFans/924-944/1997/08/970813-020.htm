Hi all

This is a question which really concerns all models.

I need to have the suspension geometry checked on my new 968.  When I 
bought it I had to replace the front tyres as they were wearing badly 
down one side.  Rather than just get a basic tracking check done I 
thought I would have the whole car checked.  My first thought was to 
use one of these wonderful computerised set ups at specialist 
workshops.  Only problem with this is the cost.  To jsutify the fact 
that they all have megabucks worth of gear to do this job they tend 
to quote a fairly high hourly rate.  One specialist locally to me was 
charging more than a main dealer.

My question is should I stick to the high tech plan or let my local 
specialist Porsche workshop do the job with a peice of string and a 
calculator?  Will the difference that a full geometry check make be 
felt in the driving as much as it is going to be felt in the 
wallet!!?

If I need to go for the computerised option, does anyone know of a 
specialist in the Oxford area(England) that can do a good job for 
less that =A3200?

Any advice welcome.

BTW had the new alarm fitted and they manage to get it to activate 
the factory fitted unit as well.  Hence me little door push LED's 
light up quite happily and blink away a treat!  Thanks for all the 
responses to my questions on this topic.  At least my experiance now
shows it can be done!
