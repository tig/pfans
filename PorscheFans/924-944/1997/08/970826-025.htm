Hey,

Like lots of you guys, my PO installed the reflector thing on
my car. Unfortunately, he chose the one that says "944" in the
farthest away possible font from the Porsche script. It looked
stupid. So, the first thing I did was remove it and relocate
the license plate to the original location. Now I have the
four mounting holes from the ex-reflector, the six or so holes
in the bumper from the license plate ex-location (I guess the
guy got drill-happy) and worst of all, where the reflector met
the body the paint was rubbed off to bare metal and rust has
started. Anyone who installs one of these things should take
some precautions to make sure it isn't rubbing! Anyway, I
really didn't take exception to the way the reflector itself
looked, just the stupid lettering (I hope I don't offend any
of the people who love their "944" reflectors, it's only my
opinion that the big round numerals don't look right). Since
I'm getting tired of looking at those holes, and I couldn't
believe the price quote from the body shop to fill them, I'm
considering refitting a new plain reflector to hide all the
damage. How much are these things going for these days?

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
