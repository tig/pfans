I wish to thank all who responded to my questions.  Its seems that the S2
I test drove is not in top form.  One mentioned that the fuel pressure
should be checked.  I also wonder if the car badly needs an Italian
tune-up given that all it has done for the 62kmiles of its life is drive
to work and back every day and probably has never seen more than 3.5krpm
(other than when I test drove it).

On the paint matter, Porsche has a 10 year perforation warranty on those
cars but a 3 year warranty on the paint itself.  Thus, no luck there.

Though the interior of the car is in a great shape, I feel that the $17.5k
that the owner is selling the car for is too much money for the condition
it is in.

Once again, thank you for your responses.
