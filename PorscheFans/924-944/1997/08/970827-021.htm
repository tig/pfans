Ezra, you're the first to see this.  Hope the list doesn't fry me for
taking up all the bandwidth.  If you see any mistakes, please let me
know and I will correct them before posting tomorrow.

Thanks for all your help.

OK Porschefans, Here it is!  All the information (and more) you ever
wanted to know about O2 sensors.  I wish I could say I was this brainy
expert on O2 sensors, however, the majority of this information came
from other lists, the library and chats with Bosch and Borg Warner, as
well as with local shop owners and other Porsche owners, and some
experiments using my Porsche as the guinea pig.  And thanks Ezra for
your assistance.

HOW DOES AN OXYGEN SENSOR WORK
The oxygen sensor is a measuring device that determines the oxygen
content of the exhaust gas.  The oxygen content reacts with the sensor
to produce a voltage output.  Basically, it is a chemical generator,
constantly making a comparison between the oxygen inside the exhaust and
the air outside.  If this comparison shows little or no oxygen in the
exhaust, a voltage is generated.  The output of the sensor is usually
between 0 and 1.1 volts (for our purposes).  All spark combustion
engines need the proper air-fuel ratio to perform correctly.  This being
14.7 parts of air to 1 part fuel (stoichmetric).  The O2 sensor will
constantly change in an effort to maintain stoichmetric.  When the
engine has more fuel than needed, all available oxygen is consumed in
the cylinders and the gases leaving through the exhaust contain almost
no oxygen.  The sensor sends out a voltage greater than .45 volts to the
control unit.  If the engine is running lean, all fuel is burned and the
extra oxygen leaves the cylinders and flows through the exhaust.  In
this case, the sensor voltage goes lower than .45 volts.  The most
common output range is .2 to .7 volts.
The sensor does not begin to generate output until approximately 300
degrees Celsius and is at optimum performance around 600C.  At this
time, a closed-loop control of air-fuel mixture is created.  Prior to
this, the sensor is active, (open-loop mode).  The control unit only
uses information provided by the O2 sensor in the closed-loop mode.  
Mid-point voltage is approximately .45 volts.  This is at a point where
there is neither a rich nor lean condition.  A fully warmed up sensor
WILL NOT spend any time at .45 volts.  The control unit sends out a bias
voltage of .45 volts through the O2 sensor wire.  If the sensor is not
warmed up or if the circuit is not complete, the control unit gets a
signal from the sensor of .45 volts.  Since the control unit knows this
is an inappropriate value, it believes the sensor is not ready.  It
remains in open-loop operation and uses all sensors except the O2 sensor
to regulate air-fuel mixture.  Any time an engine is operated in an
open-loop mode it will have a rich condition.  Obviously this results in
lost power and poor fuel economy as well as other fuel-related problems.
The O2 sensor is constantly in a state of transition between high and
low voltage.  In technical terms the crossing of the .45 voltage mark is
called cross count.  The higher the number of O2 cross counts the better
the sensor.  The faster the cross counts, the better and quicker ability
the control unit has of adjusting the air-fuel mixture.  

DETERMINING IF THE O2 SENSOR IS BAD
O2 sensors do wear out; however, not nearly at the rate manufacturers
would have you believe.  Many good to excellent O2 sensors are replaced
unnecessarily.  Most manufacturers recommend testing the O2 sensor every
20,000 miles and/or replacing every 25,000 to 60,000 miles.  Research
has shown that O2 sensors routinely last 50,000 to 70,000 miles and, if
the engine is well maintained, will last for the life of the vehicle.  I
believe that testing the O2 sensor every 30,000 miles as a precautionary
measure would be adequate or at any time you suspect problems with the
sensor. 
Indications of possible O2 sensor failure are; hesitation problem either
hot or cold, higher than normal fuel consumption and usual tune up steps
have not corrected the problem, rough idle, "hunting" idle (such as when
the engine is cold the idle is a steady 1000 rpm for a brief period,
then takes a sharp dip until the engine almost stalls, then back to 1000
rpm... and continues to cycle through in this manner), misfiring and
poor engine performance.  Additionally, if left unattended, a
malfunctioning O2 sensor could burn or loosen up your catalytic
converter resulting in an increased expense.  Remember these are not
positive indicators of an O2 sensor malfunction, they just bring up the
possibility of a problem.  Vacuum leaks and ignition problems are also
common fuel robbing problems.
Damage to the sensor will result any time auto repairs are made and a
silicone gasket sealer is used that is not labeled "oxygen sensor safe"
or something similar, if this sealer was used in any area connected to
the crankcase.  This includes, valve cover, head gasket, oil pan, or
other seal or gasket that contacts engine oil.  Leaded fuel will ruin
the O2 sensor in a very short period of time (several hours).  If your
Porsche has been running rich for a long period of time, the sensor may
have become plugged up with carbon deposits or even destroyed.
Undercoating, antifreeze or oil, soundproofing, or any other similar
product that comes into contact with the outside of the sensor will
destroy it.

1-WIRE OR 3-WIRE SENSOR
1-wire sensors are usually the cheapest and depend strictly upon exhaust
heat to activate them.  The sensor element must get very hot to develop
any voltage and low exhaust temperatures result in a reduction or
absence of sensor output, (thereby giving you an open-loop).  Tests have
shown there is not enough heat at idle to keep the sensor in a
closed-loop mode.  The output voltage will begin to decay in a matter of
seconds at idle.  Compensation is sometimes made in 1-wire sensors by
adjusting the trip point of the sensor based upon the temperature of the
cell.  This allows operation even if the sensor has cooled off to the
point that the voltage is much lower than it should be.  Additionally,
1-wire sensors are usually mounted at some point directly on the exhaust
manifold so as to be exposed to the hotter gases.
3-wire sensors or heated sensors are used to heat up the sensor as soon
as the engine is started, although heat is not supplied continuously.
They are usually located in the exhaust pipe or the catalytic converter.
Normally 1 lead supplies 12 volts, another will be ground and the third
will be the sensor output signal lead.  It is not advisable to use a
1-wire lead to replace a 3-wire lead unless you do not care how your
vehicle runs when cold and can afford to purchase a new catalytic
converter every year or so.

TESTING PROCEDURES - ON CAR
The engine must be fully warm,  Disconnect the sensor plug from the
wiring harness (round pull apart plug located next to the firewall near
the speed and reference mark sensor plugs).  Since the sensor output
wire must be connected to the control unit to obtain a reading, you will
need to use a jumper wire to connect terminal 1 (top male terminal) on
the sensor plug and terminal 1 (top female terminal) on the control unit
plug.  Attach the positive lead of a DC voltmeter to the O2 sensor
output wire (or jumper wire).  Attach the negative to a good engine
ground or negative terminal of the battery.  Use a voltmeter that has an
acceptable value of 1,000,000 ohms/volts or more on the DC voltage.
Most, if not all, digital voltmeters meet this requirement.  I have been
told that very few analog (needle-type) voltmeters meet this
requirement.  I have also been told not to use the digital voltmeter as,
although it will not damage the sensor, the inherent sampling rate may
mask the actual voltage and/or its cycling nature.  Both meters worked
fine for me. 
Set your meter to read 1 volt DC. Turn the key to the on position but do
not start the car.  You should see a change in the voltage on the meter.
If not double-check your connections.  Make sure your leads and wires
are out of the way of belts, etc. and start the engine.  Run the engine
for a couple of minutes to get the O2 sensor warmed up and into closed
loop mode.  You will know when you have a closed loop, as the voltmeter
will register several rapid cross counts per second.  You are looking
for the voltage to go above and below the .45 volts.  Below .45 volts
indicates rich and above .45 volts indicates lean.  If you see less than
..2 volts and more than .7 volts, your sensor is fine and the testing is
completed.  If the cross counts are SLOW, then your sensor needs to be
replaced.  If the voltage reading is steady high, low or in the middle,
you may not have the sensor in the closed-loop.  Run the engine above
2000 RPM for several more minutes. If you still have a fixed or no
voltage, you will need to remove the sensor for further testing.
If you are not getting any voltage and your Porsche has been running
rich for awhile, it is possible the sensor is carbon-fouled.  Sometimes
it's possible to clean the sensor while it remains in the vehicle.
Disconnect the sensor plug from the wiring harness and warm up the
engine.  Create a large enough vacuum leak that will cause the engine to
slow down (any vacuum lines will work).  The extra heat should burn off
the carbon deposits.  Retest the sensor.  If you still get a fixed or no
voltage, the sensor is probably bad.  Additionally, you will need to
find the cause of this rich mixture or your replacement sensor will go
bad.  If you are getting a steady low voltage reading the problem could
be associated with an exhaust leak.  In any case, I would recommend
testing the sensor off vehicle. 
Several individuals advised me of a simple test.  If you disconnect the
sensor plug from the wiring harness with the engine warmed up and
running and, when disconnected it makes a difference how smoothly the
engine runs, then the sensor is good.  No change does not mean the
sensor is bad as other fuel injection could be present.
When working on the sensor, should you accidentally short out the sensor
output wire, do not be alarmed as this normally does not harm the
sensor, it merely grounds the output voltage to zero.  Once you fix the
wire, the circuit should operate normally.  DO NOT apply voltage to the
sensor.  

TESTING PROCEDURES - OFF CAR
Disconnect the sensor plug from the wiring harness.  Raise the vehicle
and support it securely on jack stands.  Spray some liquid wrench, WD
40, etc., carefully around the base and threads of the sensor.  Unscrew
the sensor from the exhaust using some care and patience (warm the
engine, if necessary to facilitate the removal, being careful not to
burn yourself on the hot exhaust parts).  If you can use a wrench,
great.  If not, I would highly recommend the use of O2 sensor socket
($10.00, pep boys, auto zone, etc.).  Make sure you do not damage the
threads or break off the sensor.  With the sensor removed examine the
shield over the sensing tip.  A black sooty coating indicates a rich
mixture; A brownish tan coating indicates lead contamination and a
powdery white coating indicates silicone contamination.
You will need a propane torch, vise grips (or you can clamp the sensor
in a vice) and your voltmeter.  Clamp in vice or use vise grips to hold
sensor.  Connect the negative lead of the voltmeter to the casing and
the positive to the sensor output wire, terminal 1.  Set the propane
torch on high and use the inner blue flame directly on the tip of the
sensor.  You should see the voltage climb to .6 volts with 15-20
seconds, then on to .8 volts in the next 45 seconds.  If not the circuit
is open internally or there is severe lead contamination.  If it reaches
these tolerances, remove the flame. The voltage should drop to less than
..2 volts in less than four seconds.  If not the sensor is silicone
fouled.  If the sensors is maintaining the proper tolerances, heat for
two minutes to observe any voltage drop.  Sometimes, the sensor's
internal connections will open under heat.  In this case the sensor is
bad.  If everything checks out up to this point and you are getting
rapid cross counts as you move the flame back and forth, the sensor is
good.  Put some anti-seize compound on the THREADS ONLY and replace.  
Any O2 sensor that will have a reading of .9 volts or more when heated
and read .1 volt or less with one second of flame removal and will pass
the two minute test is GOOD!

RECOMMENDATIONS
I received several replies concerning what other Porsche owners are
using or have used.  Some stated they shell out the money and purchase
the correct Bosch sensor.  Others have used the universal Bosch 3-wire
and have not reported any problems. Still others have used the Bosch
part number 13913 (I believe this is the number used by Bosch to market
their sensors under the Precision Tune logo).  I also discovered that
Bosch routinely changes their part numbers so this could be one of their
newer part numbers.  13913 is a Ford sensor and fits 84-86
Mustangs/T-birds, 85-86 Continentals/Town Cars and other Ford products.
The Ford sensor is also being used by several BMW owners as well as
Volkswagen Jetta owners. The 10 digit number for the 13913 sensor is
0258003913.  The 10 digit Bosch number for 944 is 0258003011.  Price
difference approximately $100.00.  It should be noted that different
sensors are set with different trip points, voltage settings and lambda
settings as the heat builds in the sensor to facilitate either rich or
lean bias depending on the application.  Virtually all 944's should have
the following settings at 600C:

VOLTS		LAMBDA
 .05		    1.02
 .25		    1.00
 .50		    1.00
 .75		    1.00
 .80		     .96
 .90		     .90
 .95		     .80

Now let's say you purchase a standard 3-wire Bosch sensor (E971-9F472-AA
- Bosch changing numbers again). 

VOLTS		LAMBDA
 .25		    1.02
 .375		     .99
 .50		     .95
 .625		     .92
 .75		     .88
 .875                      .85
1.00		     .82

As you can see there is a difference between the two sensors.  Obviously
this will effect the performance of the vehicle, even though a change of
..1 lambda is quite small when you consider the normal range of a fuel
system is from approximately 12.0:1 to 16:1 (air fuel ratio)

Optimal engine performance occurs at lambda 1.000, which equates to
stoichmetric.

Bosch manufactures their sensors to come into lambda 1.000 at
approximately .3 volts.  The curve is reduced at approximately .85
volts.  Rich or lean bias is changed depending upon application.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Purchasing the correct O2 sensor for your particular make, model and
year is ultimately the best way to go.  However, it would be beneficial
to obtain the Bosch part number from your current sensor and
cross-reference this number.  One of the Jetta owners did this and found
his Bosch part number was identical to the Ford number (13913) - savings
for this owner - $90.00.  Should you decide to use the Ford sensor or a
universal 3-wire, you will have to cut, solder and use heat shrink
tubing to splice your old sensor plug to the new sensor.  Make sure the
connections are extremely clean and use at least an 80-watt soldering
gun.

 




By the way, I was going to change my sensor, but since testing I have
found no need.
