I think the FCC has the last word when it comes to jamming, or willful
interference as they call it.  If it were legal to jam police radar, why do
they have to disguise it?

I do know that there are a few frequencies where you are allowed to operate
a transmitter under part 15 of the FCC law (less than 100 mW into a small
antenna), but I doubt that the radar band is such a frequency. Furthermore,
no station is allowed to cause willful interference to any other station.
It would be easy to prove that the sole purpose of such an instrument was
meant to do just that in a court of law.  It would be classified as a
Federal offense as well, ouch.

One of these days I will look up the exact law.
