Hiya,

I want to thank all the members of this group that responded to my
odometer query, especially Darrin Smith.  Darrin has instructions on how
to fix the odometer.  At the end of this message there is an URL to
Darrin's instructions.

Darrin,

Thanks a bunch, I fixed the odometer, your instructions were very good.
The whole job only took an hour because this is the 3rd time I had the
speedometer out.  I have a couple of hints about the job if you want them.

1) The first thing I did in the engine compartment, I unhooked the
speedometer cable wire clamp.  This gave me an extra foot of cable to feed
into the passenger compartment, so the speedometer could be pulled out
further.


2) I have large hands also, so I couldn't put the right bulb into the
slot.  My solution was to mark the hole with a pencil on the side of the
speedometer, then with the speedometer about half way in, I used a
L-shaped piece of wire to push the bulb into the slot using the pencil
mark as a guide for the hole.  The first time without the wire it took
over three hours just to get that one bulb into the slot, this time it
took less than 5 minutes with the wire.


I think this is the second time the speedometer has been fixed, there was
an odometer reading and someones initials written in pencil on the inside
of the speedometer case.  I guess this is a poor design.


Thanks again,
Robb...
