On the Porsche I only increased the fuse sizes.  Stock size is 7.5 amps =
for all lamps (high/low and left/right are fused independently.  Fogs =
and Driving lights are fused as set pairs  Changed all the high/low =
fuses to 10 amp and the fogs and driving light fuses to 20 and 25 amp =
respectively.  I (knock on wood) have not had any problems up to now.  =
The stock relays are 40 amp so I should remain well within the maximum =
limits of the system.

Hi Mike, did you use any additional relays in the wiring with the high
watt bulbs? TIA

     I saw a reply of mine posted at least 3 times!  I only sent it once, 
     and only to the 924-944 list.  Just in case this explodes and repeats 
     indefinitely, what's the solution again?
