Thanks for the tip.  Unfortunately for me, the break is inside the lift-arm
box.  There's no room in there for that type of repair.  I talked to
Kempton Bros. today and they will sell me the driver's side tube and cable
assy (including the lift-arm) for $45.  There's a junction box up on the
roof between the lift arms where the motor cable meets the individual
lift-arm cables.  The transplant can be grafted in here.  Apparently this
scenario is not that uncommon since the Kempton guy understood right away
what I needed.  What is interesting is that the (factory) shop manual warns
that you should not open the junction or lift-arm boxes.  Perhaps they
wanted to discourage anyone from fixing the assembly rather than running
down to the dealer.  I mean it's not like they are Swiss movement!

I have done it!  My break was in the back by the motor.  What I did was
create a sleeve using some tubing.  I had to put a piece of tubing inside
of tubing to adjust for the different diameters of the cable being joined. 
Then I put hose clamps on both ends of the tubing.  It worked like a charm!
  Any further questions, do not hesitate to ask.  I am a poor person that
has to do his own work to justify the car to the wife.
