I can confirm at least one more Corvette death in Germany. Sitting behind
one travelling between 100 to 110 mph I witnessed the engine of a Corvette
let go in a rather spectacular cloud of smoke. Judging by the amount of
oil that ended up on my windscreen (even at 50 meters) Id say someone is
in for a very expensive rebuild.

931 "light-weight" hmmmmm...
