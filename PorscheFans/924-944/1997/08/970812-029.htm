Subject: need info about 944

Hi,
 I need some more info about me buying a 944. I am only 17. I plan to
buy a sports car... hopefully a Porsche, ...
I really love the Porsche. I will get one sometime in my
life..later if not now. Should I just forget about this idea right now,
and get an rx-7 or mr-2? I have many more questions. Hope to hear from
everyone soon!!


Steve,

  I am fortunate enough to have a '91 MR2 (MKII) and an '83 944.  I
suppose it goes without saying, the MR2 is far cheaper to maintain.  I
purchased them both within a week of each other (around March of this
year).  So far, the MR2 has needed an oil change.  The 944 has needed
(after the first day of owning it, the clutch started going.  It just
got fixed last week):

Fixed:

     New Clutch
     Passenger's side PWR window switch
     Drivers' side door handle
     Flaky oil pressure gauge
     Flaky Fuel Gauge
     Timing Belt replacement
     Rear Hatch Seal
     30,000 mile checkup

Not Fixed:

     Two sunroof leaks
     Lower Right Control Arm Bushings (is this hard?)
     Rear wheel bearings (same as above)
     Alternator starting to go (shows a "ripple" the mechanic says,
     though still charging)
     A/C won't start compressing (hopefully simple electrical problem,
     otherwise, new compressor)
     Clutch pedal won't come back up, stops right above friction point,
     must lift with foot to get it to snap back up (mechanic said need
     new pedal bracket, not building up enough pressure to push pedal
     back)

The stuff that was fixed (there are some things I forgot, though) has
cost me $2400.  The car sat for a few months while I was trying to pony
up the cash for the clutch.  That was depressing.  It got all dusty,
cats walked on it, leaving footprints, which was even more insulting.  I
started it every week or so, until it stopped starting.  Then I got
worried.  A week later, it started again, and has started ever since
(whew!).

The other side:

  The MR2 is a great little (emphasis on LITTLE) car.  Mine is
(unfortunately) an automatic (meant for fiancee, though I drive it when
P-Car doesn't work).  It is quick and nimble, and if I had a turbo,
would actually be quite fast.  The mileage is actually fairly close to
the 944 (I thought it would be better, but it doesn't have the little
1.6 of the MK I, but a 2.2L).  As the saying goes, nothing passes an MR2
on the corner.  Well, let me tell you, you have to be PERFECT every time
in that car around corners or you will pay.  I have done a few 360's
(maybe even a 720, but who can tell).  Me in my 944 will blow me in my
MR2 away.  I love the 944 way more than the MR2.  It puts me in touch
with the road like no other car I have ever been in.  When I start to
slide in a turn, I don't worry at all, it is always a perfect four wheel
slide, that I have control over.  You can always get it back.  Granted,
I need better tires on the MR2, it has 14" 195/60's, Blizzaks.  They
will not keep you on the road in the rain, which is kinda funny since
they are snow tires.

  I also thought about an RX7 TurboII.  I didn't go there.  Everyone has
one.  Also didn't want to have to deal with Rotary problems.  Porsche
problems, though sometimes as plentiful or expensive, are significantly
less nebulous.  I also learned to drive on a 924, so I always told
myself I would buy a Porsche someday.  I paid $5000 for the 944 with 71K
miles on it (I think it was set back though, it had a damaged title).
The engine is very strong.  I didn't expect to spend so much money on it
so fast, though I did expect to pay at some point.  It doesn't bother me
because I love the car.  I won't ever tell someone not to go for their
dream when it would be much more practical not to, because this is what
I did, and still do.  But, if you need an everyday car and don't keep a
few grand around for when a disaster strikes, I would suggest not buying
one.  Get the MR2.  It is a much more reliable car than the RX7 or 944
(by a few orders of magnitude).  You can ignore the maintenance on them
to a great degree.  Ignoring the maintenance in the others will send you
to bankruptcy court.

Just my observations,

Derek Fisher
