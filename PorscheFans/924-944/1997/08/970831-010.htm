Hi Terry:
You mean the Kappas were defective? Have you listened to JBL or Boston
acoustic 4x6?

How much power do your amps run and what was feeding the Kappas?

Are these the 200is? I considered them but plan on running my built-in
power front unit with only 20Watts clean x 4 (which is probably only 10W
compared to a seperate amp) and ADS reccommends 15+ Watts.

Which model # are these? 4x6 plate or the EX462? TIA
