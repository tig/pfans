     Sorry about the wasted BW. Apparently the mail server could't tranlate 
     my simple word document fractions. Here is the corrected text, 
     including the importatnt stuff. 
     
     Well, my hot running 951 is no longer running hot.  I figured I'd post 
     my experience in case anyone has the same symptoms.  
     
     The 86 951 had been running at the 3/4  mark, consistently, going as 
     high as to the beginning of the orange mark when sitting in traffic 
     for extended periods.  But the car never really "overheated".  The 
     fans would come on but would not bring the temp down much.  Once the 
     car was moving the temps would quickly lower to the 3/4 mark.  The car 
     has always run between 1/4 and 1/2 prior to this so I knew there was a 
     problem.  Anyway, because the fans would turn on  I knew the fan 
     switch was OK.  Also I knew there was some circulation to the radiator 
     because hot water was getting to the fan switch in the first place. 
     This suggested that the thermostat was opening.  I bled the system and 
     changed the old coolant.  No change.   
     
     I figured it was either a thermostat that was only opening partially, 
     or a corroded radiator.  I have seen radiators unable to dissipate 
     enough heat as they get over 10 years old and have not been treated to 
     regular coolant changes.  Radiators are not cheap so I tried the 
     thermostat first. Even though I thought it pretty unlikely that it was 
     opening but still reducing flow.    
     
     First of all, it takes a special tool to remove the T-stat.  I have a 
     wide selection of snapring pliers with 90 degree tips.  Unfortunately, 
     none with long enough tips.  I haven't seen the snap-on guy in a while 
     and I didn't want to pay the $45 that automotion gets for their tool.  
     So I drove to my local Sears hardware store and bought a nice 3pack of 
     11" handled needlenose pliers.  $19 for a straight-tip pair, a 45 
     degree pair, and a 90 degree pair.  The 90s were what worked.  The 
     reach was sufficient to get into the end of the water pump and remove 
     the snap ring.  I did all of the work from the top.  I simply 
     disconnected my coil wire  to get it out of the way, disconnected the 
     lower hose where it connects to the water pump, pushed it down out of 
     the way and removed the t-stat.   Not that its  all that easy though.  
     I used a mirror, a shop light, and a fair amount of patience to locate 
     the tips of the pliers in the holes on the snap ring you can't see on 
     an engine that is still hot. 
     
     The bottom line.  The thermostat was the solution.  The car maintains 
     its temp perfectly now.  The fans now work at both speeds.  Before 
     they only turned on to the first speed.  Now, if the temps go between 
     _ and orange the fans will go to hurricane speed and temps come down 
     quickly.  However, only when the car idles 15-20 mins in 90 degree sun 
     with air in the system will the temps go above 3/4 anyway.  Now that 
     the air is completely bled I suspect I'll never hear the hurricane 
     force fanspeed again. 
     
     By the way, I used the 80 degree t-stat (replacing my defective 83 
     degree)  I like my heat hot in the winter so I didn't go with the 
     reduced temp t-stat.  Also, I don't want my fans running all the time 
     and corrupting flow when I'm driving  so I didn't use a reduced temp 
     fan switch.
     
     Hope this helps.
