>"Apparently I have a crack in my head." The word "apparently" got my
>attention. Have you confirmed this with a competent mechanic. If you live
>in the midwest, there's a guy named Tom Charlesworth in Oklahoma City who
>is PCA's national tech advisor for 944s. 918-644-8714 and woth a call......

>The conversion process for 944s included using a CNC machining center to
>carve out .100" from all surfaces of the combusiton chamber, while
>maintaining the same contours as the original design. The piston was also
>"dished" by removing material from the center of the piston (beginning
>about 1/8" in from the edge, to the same depth as the "eyebrow" cuts made
>to acommodate the valves. I haven't had a cracked head, but other problems
>led us to rebuild the engine with the steel-sleeved block that Callaway
>used for all conversions after the first "ten or so". We also used factory
>turbo pistons, since the originals were showing hot spots on the crankcase
>side. The CNC process left the pistion crown thinner enough that excess
>heat had no where to go but to begin burning through. When your car is
>apart, I highly recommend replacing the pistons, too.

>Simply replacing the head will not do the job. It needs to be modified as
>the first one was, or the boost pressure will simply give you horrendous
>early detonation problems. Callaway realy isn't interested in supporting
>these cars, but you may be able to get them to dig out their CNC tapes and
>do a head, or pass them along to a properly-equipped shop who can. Be
>assertive, not aggressive, and persuasive......
>
>Where to get a head, cheap....... Try calling George Beuselinck,
>800-ALL-P944, or "georgeb@mhv.net". He may not have the part separately,
>but probably knows where to look. Also, check you local PCA chapter for a
>copy of Porsche Panorama, a great source of parts. Join PCA if you haven't
>already, it's a great group....
