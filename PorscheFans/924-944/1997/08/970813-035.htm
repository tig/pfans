Repair manual: '90 944 S2 CAB

Hi P-fans,
        I=92m a newbie. I just bought my first Porsche, it's a 1990 944 S=
2
Cabriolet Guards Red with Black leather and Top, 43K, really clean. I
absolutely love driving this car. It=92s my daily commuter from Long Isla=
nd
to New Jersey, I=92ve had it a week and put 3k on it already.

Turns a lot of heads on the road, seems people don=92t know what it is. W=
hen
I=92m driving through Manhattan (actually stopped in traffic) with the to=
p
down people keep yelling hey what kind of car is that or hey you want to
trade, I just smile (feeling pretty good) and say Porsche or I don=92t th=
ink
so, and crank the jams.  I read through the archives and you people are
really great with all the advice and information you share. The info is
great but it's tough searching the archives for specifics, I=92d be real =
nice
if we could set up a database that was organized by year, model and
category, I=92d volunteer some time.

Any way as I get more familiar with the car I=92m sure I=92ll have a lot =
more
questions but in the mean time:

1.  I=92d like to get a repair manual. I called Haynes when I couldn=92t =
find
one in any of the parts stores and the one they publish #1027 only covers=

up to 1989. I checked Chiltons web site and Carbooks but no luck, I=92ll =
try
Clymer next. =

2. I=92m thinking about getting a bra for the nose, never used one before=
, is
it scratches or rub marks vs. Stone chips,  who makes a good one? Can I u=


se
it all year long, in any weather?  Any feed back would be appreciated.
3. I plan on using the car year round, can any of you winter drivers tell=

me how the car is on snow, ice, sand. What type of tire/wheels should I
use, the Toyo=92s I have on there now are great but I don=92t think they=92=
ll cut
it in winter.  I know, why am I talking about winter when its 95 outside?=

Just want to plan ahead. =
