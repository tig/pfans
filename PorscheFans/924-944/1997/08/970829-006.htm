Greetings all,

	While driving home last night I suddenly began having a vibration at 3K
RPM  the drive line and shifting gears became almost impossible.  When the
accelerator was released quickly there was a "clunk".  It would seem the
clutch (with about 65K miles on it) needs replacement.  My questions are as
follows.

	Should I investigate something else before getting a new clutch (i.e.
transmission)?
	Who has a good price on a clutch package?
	What special tools are needed (suggested)?

	Any other advice by someone who has done a clutch  themselves, that is not
covered in the Haynes manual is also appreciated.
TIA

Stu
