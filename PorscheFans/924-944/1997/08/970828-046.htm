This is a bit of a tangent but depending on the job to be done, I have
found car ramps to work well as long as the wheels don't need removing.  I
know some will say "the ramp angle is too steep".  Yes it is.  A more
gradual ramp angle is achieved with 2 pieces of 2 x 6 about 4 feet long
with a hole drilled near one end of each to fit a carriage bolt (with the
rounded top, about 3" long ).  Another hole is drilled about half way up
the ramp to line up with the hole in the end of each 2 x 6.  The carriage
bolt is inserted through the wood and into the hole in the ramp and does
not need any fastener.  It just keeps the wood from moving while you are
driving up.  You could get a little fancier and cut the leading edge (at
opposite end of 2 x 6) at a shallow angle but I have not found this to be
necessary.  The wood does bend a little but the load is carried for a short
time only (a 4 x 4 block under the middle of the 2 x 6 stops this).  This
really works well and keeps the ramps from sliding along the concrete floor
(and is easy to do without a 'spotter').  If the whole car needs to be
raised (i.e. if you are doing a clutch), another set of ramps under the
rear wheels are installed by jacking the rear  corners (I do it on the
trailing arm mounts) and placing the ramp under each tire and then letting
the jacks down.  The ramps provide a MUCH more stable platform than jack
stands.  Now if the wheels must be removed (and you are going 'under') then
jack stands are unavoidable, however, I am usually able to plan my work so
that only one end (or one side) of the car at a time needs to be lifted. 
With one pair of wheels still on the ground, stability is far greater.  In
my opinion, any car up on 4 jack stands alone is just plain dangerous.
