Hi  all,
I am selling my 1987 944. It is Marichino Cherry in color (burgandy) and

has 98k on the odometer.  I bought it from the original owner last
November.  The car is in excellent shape and needs nothing.  The timing
belt has been checked by a Porsche mechanic and deemed good for the time

being.  I have put approximately 10,000 miles on the car and have
changed the oil and filter 5 times using Mobil 1 and Mahle filters. It
has an after market hi flow exhaust from the PO and a new K&N.  The
interior is black and tan (the interior is awesome) This car has all
options and everything works (even the rear wiper and headlight
washers).  I am asking 6,500 which I think is a fair price. (I would ask

more but the PO gave me very few records).
I can be reached at 812-332-1726 in Bloomington, Indiana. or by e-mail
at dcwebb@indiana.edu.

Dan Webb
