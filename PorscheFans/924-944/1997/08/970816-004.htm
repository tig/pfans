Subject: Boost pressure to wastegate

Be sure of your technical information before you make a post to the
list.  A 951 wastegate does not open by vacuum, but by boost pressure.

The line going to the wastegate ultimately comes off of the intake
manifold.  If you are building up boost in the intake manifold, you have
no vacuum, but pressure.  This pressure will overcome the spring seat
pressure in the valve of the wastgeate.  When you adjust the boost by
means of an adjustable boost knob, you are actually restricting the
pressure going to the wastegate, alllowing the valve to stay closed.

On older 930 turbos, we used to shim up the spring in the wastegate so
if would stay closed longer.  On that style, the adjustable boost knob
would add additional pressure to he wastegate diaphram, counteracting
the exhaust pressure trying to open the valve.  I don't remember what we
did with 924 Carrera GTR's or 924 turbos.

Just wanted to correct a post with misleading information.

Yes that post temporarily confused me also. I also have a question maybe
you can help with concerning the boost line to wastegate. On my 1980 931
someone put a ball check fitting between the manifold fitting and the
boost line. It is a steel ball that seats in the flare of the manifold
fitting with a small spring behind it holding it in place. I assume the
idea was that boost pressure would overcome the spring pressure at some
unknown? pressure, and then go to the wastegate thus opening it. I
purchased another boost line from a local wrecking yard which came off a
1980 931 and it did not have this fitting. Thus I assume this is not
factory. Somebody spent some time machining this fitting. I wonder why?
Recently doing some routine maintainence I had the upper pressure
manifold off. After replacing everything my troubles began. Now at 4000
rpm I lose all power i.e. boost. I redid all the upper connections,
thinking I probably had an air leak under boost. No change. I have
checked the electrical boost sender, and I believe it is OK. Before
putting my hands on I was getting 12-14 psi WOT all the way to the red
line. Now I get 14 psi to 4000-4200 rpm WOT and then it cuts out
completely. Otherwise the engine starts instantly on the first turn.
Idle is steady at 1000 rpm, I adjusted it up a little from 900 rpm
because the A/C drags it down about 100-150 rpm. Any thoughts.
Wastegate? Boost line? Air leak? TIA
