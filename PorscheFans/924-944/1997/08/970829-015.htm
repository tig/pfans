I had to drive a Chrysler LeBaron convertible 2 years ago... It was
ghastly.  The amount of body shake, rubbery steering and soft brakes
were scary.  I drove a Ford Aspire last month as a rental, scary, and I
just finished a test drive of the new Oldsmobile Intrigue.  The Intrigue
is a very pretty car, but the seats are wide, the belts don't hold you
in place, and I'm not certain about emergency handling.  It really is
nice for an Oldsmobile though, and I'd feel pretty safe at 70 except for
the seat belts which must have been made for someone much, um, wider. 
My mom has a newish Pontiac Bonneville, which is a terrific car except
that the gas pedal is too light.  I have never driven a minivan, but I
think my chief objections would be wind loading and brakes.  Has anyone
driven the Dodge Avenger?  I like that car's looks.  My roomie just
bought an '86 Audi 5000 with almost 200k miles, and that car is still
very solid, good handling, nice and quiet.  The only American car I have
driven lately that I'd really like, I think, is a V-8 Firebird Formula.
I'd like to hear about other recent test-drive or ownership experiences
of non-Porsches in comparison to our cars, and comparisons of 928s and
911s too. (I know, I know, this is a 924-944 site...)
