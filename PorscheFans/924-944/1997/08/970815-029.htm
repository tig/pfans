Hi Rick,
	Before I got into 944's, my brother and I built and drag raced VW's for
about 12-13 years.  I have also rebuilt 1500/1600 356 engines with dual
Solex carbs.  They are all right power plants. It's the same engine
found in the original 912, not the 912E.  Anyway, I recommend you stick
with the VW powerplant and increase the power.  There are so many more
modifications and parts available for them.  Plus, 356/912 engines can
be very expensive.
	However, I recall reading some literature about 356 replicas and how
the kit manufacturers recommend against high displacement, high
horsepower applications.  The reason being is that cooling the engine is
difficult with that body style.  However, you can always over come that
with the addition of larger oil sumps and remote oil coolers used in
conjunction with the stock oil cooler found in the fan housing.  The
possibilities are endless and limited only by your wallet.  If you are
seriously interested in getting more bang out of your 356 replica, write
me directly so I don't waste anymore BW.  Sorry list, but Rick owns a
water pumper too.:)
