I have the exact same problem as Michael S. Cromer (modmech@juno.com) had
stated.  After work the other day my 87 would not start. I was not getting
any spark. I got out the haynes manual to check the coil. It says between
terminals 1 and 15 the resistance should be .4 to .6 which it is. Then it
says to check resistance between 1 and 4, 4 is under the little rubber
cover. All I find in terminal 4 is some tarie black stuff and I can't check
resistance because of this stuff.  I have ordered a replacement coil but I
am on hold because of the UPS strike. 

You mention this "flywheel reference sensor".  I can't find any reference
to it in the haynes manual or parts listing (i.e., AutoAtlanta).  Could you
tell me how to locate said sensor on car and how to change it?

Thanks
