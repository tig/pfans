I consider exactly that a very major difference.  The properties are
fundamentally altered.  Synthetic oils can provide properties unheard of
within the realm of regular oils.  

I also would like to express my doubts with regards to the "pretty much
the same structure" argument with regards to synethic oils.  That does
not at all correspond with what Mobil engineers have said to me.

Cheers,
Chris
