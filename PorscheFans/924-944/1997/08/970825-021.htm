     PorscheFans,
     
     I need help in tracking down an elusive problem. When I am running the 
     A/C in my '86 944 NA and come to a stop the car has a quick, violent 
     shudder (can visually see hood shake).  By watching the in-dash tach, 
     when coming to a stop, the RPMs fall below idle to ~750-800 RPM (when 
     the rough idle shudder occurs), then bounces back up to normal idle at 
     ~900 RPM.  This does not occur if the car is just sitting and the 
     engine is reved up and released; only when driving. I've checked all 
     vacuum connections I could find, 
     
     Water pump was replaced by PO; how can I tell if I have the new, 
     improved style?
     
     My .02 on the FWD thread. My best friend just bought a new Honda 
     Prelude, and there was an interesting (and expensive) option. It's 
     some sort of torque transfer system that divides power between the 
     front wheels based on throttle position, steering wheel angle, etc so 
     that outer wheel recieves more power, helping eliminate understeer. 
     But I'll be a believer in RWD (as I put on my flame-retardant suit) 
     until I see a FWD capable of handling a 500hp, 502ci big block engine.
     
     TIA,
     Thomas Carter
