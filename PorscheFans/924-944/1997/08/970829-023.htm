On the flip side, I was driving down a wide (5-lane) city freeway with very
little traffic--all lanes were clear.  I was in the fast lane just tooling
along, probably doing over the limit, but not by much.  I look in my rear
view and it was just normal traffic flow, with no cars to my immediate
right, back or front.  I look down again at the road and continue driving.

It must have been instinct because I got the feeling something was wrong so
I looked back up in the rear view.  I see a patrol car with light fully
ablaze and flashing barreling down on me.  This is not an
exaggeration--there was no warning.  One second the lane was clear, the
next he was right on my bumper.  I can only surmise that he made one huge
5-lane change from the nearest on-ramp to the left lane and promptly got
behind me in order to try and cut the apex of the turn in the freeway,
where I just happened to be.

It took me a second to get over the shock, and I know he had to brake in
the second or two it took for me to move over.  Of course, I got out of his
way, but it scared the s@!# out of me.  I hate to think if it had been some
grandmother or someone who just got their license and was on the freeway
for the first time.  Could have been ugly.  Maybe a red Porsche was too
much of a temptation?  Traffic was absolutely clear to my right, yet he had
to come right up to my rear bumper!?  I saw him speed away and more or less
followed him for about the next five minutes until he disappeared--he
stayed in the fast lane the whole time, but I never did see what all the
fuss was over.

No question of legality or illegality here, I guess, but those flashing
lights really get to you!
