First: Open the hood. Under the nose panel (the one with the badge), you
should see a white/yellow air-scoop with a hole (for connecting the hose) at
the left side (from the front). You will also see a hole with the same
diameter at the bottom of the engine, in line with the hole on the scoop.
These two holes connect with a hose similar (if not identical) to the hoses
used for the interior heating. Take a look under the steering column, and
you can see what kind of hose to get.
