I had the same thing happen to me once with my 86 951.  I was driving along
with everything normal (I'm a gauge watcher, as I am sure most of us
Porschefiles/PorscheFans are) when suddenly I started to lose power.
Luckily I was going down a hill and I coasted into a church parking lot.
(This is where the resurrection took place ).  I checked all my gauges when
it happened and all was normal, they were the same as always.  Well I spent
the next hour under the hood looking at all my electrical connections and
assorted other thingees under the hood.  My friend/MaGiver/car genius
stopped by, listened to my tale, and then, within one minute found my
disconnected vacuum hose.  It turns out that the clamp had been loosened by
me a few weeks earlier when I was replacing my voltage regulator (the job
from hell!!) and the hose had fallen off.

The moral of this long tale is, check all of your vacuum connections,
Porsches are very sensitive to this!
Just thought it might help out.
