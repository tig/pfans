Sorry, but oh please! How about a little reality? 

How tough is it to aim the old Chrylser piece of junk straight,
and stand on the throttle? We're talking INTERSTATE highways here, 
not the high banks of Daytona! I find it difficult to believe that
a modern (1996 is modern) automobile, even one made by Chrylser,
is not safe at even the ungodly speed of 70 mph.

If you were referring to driving the same vehicle on a two lane,
twisty, backroad highway at a fast rate, I would agree with you.
However, since I see lots and lots of 18 wheelers driving on the
highway, and they're all going 70, and I don't see mass carnage
on the roads every day, and even a lowly minivan will stop and
handle better than an 18 wheeler, I just have to conclude that
the minivans are indeed safe vehicles. 

I certainly don't want to drive in one, but they are competant
on the highway.
