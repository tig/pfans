To recap, I was complaining last week becuase of a whining balance shaft
belt after a water pump/roller/belt replacement.  My independent shop
(owner is former Cascade Region PCA President) insists this is normal, and
they do use the holy 9201 gauge.  The car never whined before, and they
sure didn't whine rolling out of the factory.  So, I asked the list for a
mini survey of belt noise, results are below: 

Noisy all the time:  3 replies
Noisy, then quieted over a period of time:  5 replies
Quiet all the time, even after replacement:  7 replies

(Total replies, 15 - thank you!)

Following are a few comments inserted with the replies:

* Belt tension too tight
* Belt tension too loose (?)
* Flutter reducing idler located above and right of lower balance shaft 
  sprocket, should not be contacting teeth of belt as it passes over the 
  lower balance shaft sprocket.  Should be gapped to .5 mm between teeth 
  of belt and roller surface (according to factory manual).
* One person didn't recall any new 944 leaving a dealership with such noise.

So, it looks like when I go back to the shop at the 1000 mile retension 
for the new belts, I will cover these points to see if this is solved. 
The factory manual gives the following tension specs for the belts, using 
the 9201 gauge:

Balance belt:  2.7 +/- .3
new camshaft belt up to 3000 km: 2.4 - 4.3
...over 3000 km:  2.7 +/- .3

I will ask them to tension the balance belt to the looser end of the 
specification (would that be 3, or 2.4?) to see if that lessens the noise.

Thanks again everyone, for your participation.

 -Gregor  89 944 2.7.  New belts a bit quieter, 400 miles so far.
