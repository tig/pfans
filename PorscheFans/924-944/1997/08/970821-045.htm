Here's an update on my exercise in trying to re-glue the rear hatch
glass on my wife's 924 for those reading this thread...

I have found another adhesive which I am going to try, since I've been
unable to find the recommended epoxy. It's GOOP! Literally, GOOP Marine
Adhesive and Sealant (it comes in a bunch of variants, including
Carpenter's, Industrial, and Houshold...). I've tested a little bit of
it on the hatch (just squirting it into existing gaps) and it seems to
have the necessary adhesion power and flexibility for the job.
Previously, I'd tried 3M's Black Super Weatherstrip Adhesive, and found
it to be insufficient in both areas, as well as seeming to dry out once
on the car.

Vaughan,

I have had bad luck with GOOP.  The adhesive properties are not long
lasting.  I think it may contain silicone.

I have a buddy who use to work for an auto glass installer.  He always ha=
d
this black glue on his hands that would not come off.  I had tried severa=
l
sealants to hold my boat windshields in place with no luck.  Then I got m=
y
friend to get me a few tubes of the sealant he always had on his hands.  =
It
was #U-400 urethane auto glass sealant manufactured by Essex (201)773-630=
0.
 The windshields are still tight years later after pounding at sea and on=

Baja roads.  I am hanging on to my last tube to do my hatch if it comes
loose.
