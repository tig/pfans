Steven,

My '86 951 now features a hollowed out catalytic converter.  I didn't trace
the thread back far enough to find what the problem with yours is.  But I am
assuming it is clogged and is restricting exhaust flow.

I can't make performance gain claims on just the hollow cat because my cat
was hollowed out, Borla muffler installed, 3" stainless pipe
fabricated/installed, mass flow kit w/ rising rate fuel pressure regulator
was installed, and chip was changed all in one fell swoop.

I can make performance gain claims on this package.  One word... WOW!

The concern though is likely to be that without the cat the car won't pass
emissions.  Mine does.  The mechanic noted that the car was running a bit
rich though - which could be a variety of things now that the car is no
longer stock.
