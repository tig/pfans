You can upgrade chips for $100.  However you need to be "registered" which
costs another $100.  I don't know what the registration is for, I should find
out soon though, I've just gone through the upgrade registration process.

Regardless, APE has been really polite and honest while I've been dealing with
them (I've been dealing with Chris).

Go ahead and get the belts changed and have the service department look at the
idlers.  If you feel you should replace everything, it'll probably cost around
$500.

Yes, this whole UPS thing is ironic.  Today I spent about an hour calling
people to track down the orders I made a week and a half ago.  Luckily I didn't
send my turbo to get rebuilt till today.  When I get it back, I'll tell the
list about my experiences.

I've been working on a turbo removal post, when I get that done I'll send it to
the list for approval/comments and then maybe give it to Kevin Gross to put it
in the faq.

As soon as I remember to bring the invoice for the 2.8l conversion to work,
I'll post it.
