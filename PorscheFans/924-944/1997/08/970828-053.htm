>1. Starter - gives bad noise while starting. I checked the mounting =

     bolts, but they seem tight. Do I need to buy a new one or can this o=
ne

     be fixed somehow - of course if it is gear, I'll need to change it..=
=2E
     =

     2. Power steering: did not have a chance to lift it yet, but the =

     liquid seems to pour from two sides of the rack, mostly when I turn =
- =

     I can see traces of liquid on the road.
     =

     3. Rough idle - when I depress the accelerator, the engine can even =

     die, but if I press brake pedal - everything is OK. I would suggest =

     vacuum leakage somewhere. Any potential places?
     =

     4. I can even FEEL the engine vibrating in the drivers' place - engi=
ne

     mountings?
     =

     5. The right outside door handle is missing - any cheap place to get=
 =

     one? (need it delivered to Houston TX)
     =

     6. The oil pressure is 0 when the car if turned off, 2 while on and =

     does not depend of RPM. Guess something must be wrong here. Where is=
 =

     the oil pressure sender located in this engine?
     =

     7. Is there a mechanical heater regulator somewhere? It seems like =

     it's just a potentiometer inside, no mechanical temperature =

     regulator... And it's getting colder these days here...
     =

     8. Is there a place where I could get list of all relays and fuses i=
n =

     English? Don't read German unfortunately...
     =

     9. Gas tank - smells like leaking while filled to the top. Any =

     potential weak places?
     =

     10. Clutch pedal does not release itself to the end - the clutch =

     itself works just great, but the pedal stops after that... Will =

     bleeding help?
    <

Vladimir,

If we had this type of communication during the cold war, it might of end=
ed
years sooner.  Hope my answers to your questions do not create an
international incident.

Starter:  Pull it, 17mm and 19mm, reconnect the cables and have a friend
give it a crank.  If it has a quiet smooth operation then inspect the
flywheel ring gear and starter teeth.  The starter can be rebuilt.  A new=

one is big $$$.

Clutch:  Not clear on your problem.  However you can bleed the clutch sla=
ve
cylinder while the starter is off.

Rough idle:  Could be a vacuum leak, try spraying the vacuum lines with
carb cleaner to find the leak.
There should be a vacuum line diagram on the right wheel well next to the=

windshield washer container.

Vibration:  Good chance it is the motor mounts, the right one usually goe=
s
first.  Replace with the updated mounts.  Cost approx $85  You will also
need different bolts (38 or 40mm? long).

Oil pressure:  Sending unit is located on the lower right forward side of=

the engine.  I has two wires attached to it.  Try reversing them, this ma=
y
solve your problem.  If not try switching it with a unit that does work. =

Not sure if your 924 sender is the same.

Heater:  Control valve is located under the hood on the rear top of the
engine over the bell housing.  Check your temperature control switch on
your dash and the plastic clips that hold the control flap.

Power steering:  Unit can be resealed or can be purchased rebuilt or used=
 .

For used parts including your door handle contact George B.  He doesn't
take American Express or Rubles but may take black caviar in trade.

Relays and Fuses:  There is a water cooled parts book (944,924 & 928) tha=
t
is published by PCNA and costs $10.  It has exploded diagrams and part
numbers of most of the major parts.  If you have a fax, I can fax you a
copy of the fuse box page.

You mentioned your parts could be shipped to Houston.  I knew I should of=

stayed awake in geography class.  I always suspected it was part of Russi=
a
but wasn't sure.  Putting on flame proof suit.
