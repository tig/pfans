Subject: Brake Pad recommendations (944)


>The time is approaching when I need to install new brake pads

Jeff - I am skeptical about the Kleen Wheel dust covers.  I don't know about
the BBS wheels but with the phone dials there simply is not enough room
between the wheel and the caliper for the cover to fit.  I would also
question heat build up.

The performance shop I deal with recommended/installed Pagid (green) pads.
 As with the Mass Flow kit acceleration my one word expression for their
stopping power is WOW!

They are, however, the dirtiest pads I have ever owned, including my
Ferodo's.  I just keep thinging that the more brake dust I can put on the
wheels the better the pads must be functioning.  It also gives me an excuse
to get out of the house and away from the wife and kids...  Look how dirty
the car is Hon!
