Hey,

To add my 2 cents on this noisy belt stuff...

When I got my '87 951 and started driving it at 45K miles, the engine =
was *very* quite at idle and very smooth.  At 47K miles I had the =
Atlanta Porsche dealer do the timing belt service they supplied all the =
rollers, I supplied the belts - although I gave them the option to =
supply the belts if it affected the warranty on the job.  The belts were =
a TRW brand timing belt and a Continental brand balance shaft belt.  =
Both purchased from Automotion.

When I got the car home, the car had a noticable 'whirr' at idle speed.  =
This disappeared as the engine speed was increased off of idle.  It was =
definately coming from the timing belt area.  I then called the service =
guy at the dealer, and he said not to worry, it was a normal thing, and =
make sure I came back for the retensioning a 2-3K miles.

When 2.5K miles came, I took the car to a local (closer than Atlanta) =
shop to do the re-tensioning, along with mounting my new tires.  He =
seemed very knowledgeable, said he had the rare tensioning tool, had a =
super clean shop, and gave me the impression that he would do the job =
right.

I can attest that if the balance shaft belt is too tight, the belts will =
whine cause that's what mine did when I picked up the car.  The car =
sounded like a jet engine, increasing high pitch sound with increasing =
RPM.  The shop manager said I had a bad roller and it needed replacing.  =
"I wouldn't drive the car too far" he said.  I then told him that all =
the belts and rollers had just been replaced by a Porsche dealer, along =
with me asking about how they tensioned the belt and a general exchange =
to let the guy know that I knew how this job was supposed to be done.  =
He then stated that "Maybe I should take the car back to the dealer =
shop" - Bingo.

(Aside - As I was getting in my car, the shop owner then related a story =
to me about the crash worthyness of the 944's.  Trying to befriend a =
disgruntled, educated, and paying customer I guess.  Apparently a guy he =
knew wrecked one at about 120 mph and ran the car off the road into the =
woods and the guy walked away.  And this guy is a 930 owner.  Chalk up =
another for the water-pumper)

I left this guy's place ASAP in my new simulated turbine-powered car.  I =
immediately parked he car, removed the upper timing belt cover, and =
checked the belts and rollers by hand.  Everything seemed alright by =
feel and everything was good an clean.  The balance shaft belt tension =
felt OK, but there's a lot of distance covered from end to end - an =
aluminum block grows a lot when hot...

So, I quickly returned the car to the Atlanta Porsche dealer's service =
department and had it checked there.  They verified that the balance =
shaft belt had been adjusted too tight, but no damage was done and all =
the rollers checked out OK.  The water pump was OK too.  They also felt =
that some brands of belts - especially the balance shaft belt - will =
whine a little more than others.

But yes, I still am a little disappointed since the car still isn't as =
quiet as it was with the 8 year old belts and rollers on it.  Oh well.

So, I think a little roller whirr is OK, but the high-pitched whine - =
especially if it increases with engine speed - is not good.  Get the job =
done right with a shop that warrants the work.  And if you find a good =
shop, stay with them even if you have to drive 120 miles to get the work =
done.

BTW, I remember when I was having these experiences that George B. =
stated that his belts "whirred like crazy" when he first started his =
car, then quietened down a few minutes after.  I guess it's just normal.
