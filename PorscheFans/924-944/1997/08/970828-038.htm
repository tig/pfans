Okay, I have 245 X 45 16" Comp TAs on my 89 Turbo.  I just received the 
gift of a screw in the right rear tire.  The screw has entered near 
(about 1.5") outside edge of the tread/sidewall.

Can this be SAFELY plugged, or should I be looking for a new set of tires?

Current tread depth is 0.230".

Thanks in advance,

Post Script:

On a second note, 6 days earlier by windshield received a flying gift 
from a passing motorist.  The rock first chipped the glass, and 
subsequently split the windshield the next morning.  Dealer price for the 
glass is $2251.  That is because I have air bags.  The Sekurit glass has 
a special plastic film on the inside of the glass (part that faces the 
occupants) that is designed to protect the air bag from rupturing the bag 
from any glass splinters.  Naturally I have the $500 deductible plan.  
This is the second windshield in about one years time.  I hate trucks.

This makes one think about the cost of damages that the rising number of 
trucks on our roads cause.  Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of 
proving who owns all of this loose debris scattered on the road surface, 
you can't have retribution for irresponsibility.
