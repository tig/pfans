Both Koni and Bilstein have made what is commonly called Turbo Cup systems.
The Bilsteins are non adjustable gas units. The rears are coil over and use
"helper springs" in addition to torsion bars. Still available new. The Konis
were adjustable both front and rear with the rears double adjustable
(compression and rebound). Not sure if the fronts were double adjustable and
not entirely sure if they were gas or hydraulic. I can find out if you'd
like. The rears were also coil over with helper springs. Both Bilstein and
Koni front units were threaded for ride height adjustment. Koni does still
produce a double adustable, ride height adjustable, gas front sport strut. I
have them on my car and did pretty well at the Parade autocross. The Koni
adjustment on compression and rebound gives you 100% increase in forces.
Both the Bilstein and Koni units can use the "Turbo Cup" front spring, it is
conical shaped and progressive from about 150 LB. to 410 LB. Because these
units are set up to use a conical shaped spring, the standard Weltmeister
springs won't work, at least without modification.

They will bolt up just like you stock bars. These are merely parts available
through Porsche and unless you are purchasing them from another vendor who
provides instructions, they won't have any.

The light defenitely won't go out without the sensors plugged in. Put them
back on and diagnose from there.

Yes sir, same filter.
