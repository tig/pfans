Restitching the steering wheel cover can be done in the following way.
Provided that the leather is not too far gone the original can be re-used.
I obtained a reel of linen thread, (cotton is not strong enough) of the 
appropriate colour and two needles.
The steering wheel was removed and a suitable length of the thread was used, 
more than a metre got quite tangled.
Starting at a point where the existing stitching was still v. good one needle 
was pushed through and the other needle threaded on. From then on it is a case 
of stitching the cover back together, like threading laces in boots. It is 
important to pull the thread tight after each pair of cross overs since one 
thread can easily snag on the opposite thread. I had several false starts but 
eventually it came out fine. Care is needed to finish neatly. Finally some 
leather care and as good as new.
Clean the grease off the centre boss before you start, it won't come off my 
shirt.

Best of luck
