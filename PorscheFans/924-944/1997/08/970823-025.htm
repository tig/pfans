See previous post about find OEM horns.

Forgot a more important ?? when dealing with Porsches.
HOW DO I GET TO IT?

My current guess, based on the wiring diagrams and use of ground point 
MK IV is that they may be located behind the driver's side fog light.  If so, 
can I remove the shell behind the light assembly without losing pieces.  
The shell seems to be held with nuts and washers instead of bolts on the 
outside.  Are the bolts fixed or are they going to fall somewhere 
inacessible when I undo them and pull the shell out?  Any gotchas here?

It seems that Porsche doesn't stock a lot of nuts, bolts, washers, etc and it's 
a pain wandering the hardware aisle OVER and OVER.  Metric stocks are 
always pretty small.

P.S.  Anybody know a good source for an assortment of body clips (those 
little slipon clips that sheet metal screws go into when there isn't a 
threaded mounting point)?
