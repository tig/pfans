	Sorry to hear about your misfortune. This is much worse
	than some damn Dentyne.

	Probably. Maybe. See below...

	This is not the thing to do. Skimping on the bodywork so
	you can get a free paint job out of it is a bad thing.

	Maybe. I don't know how mechanically inclined you are.

	Here's what you do; I'm assuming you have your car serviced
	at a good Porsche shop. If not, find one, you're going to need
	them to argue with the insurance company. The insurance company
	is on;y going to want to give you what they think your car is
	worth. And to them, there's no difference between your car and
	a Toyota Tercel. That's where you'll need the help of your shop.
	You'll need all the exterior parts replaced, you need the
	suspension thoroughly checked for damage, and you'll need
	paint work. Quality paint work. I checked into paint work for
	my car for the day it needs it and was quoted in the $4K range
	for the whole car (this was a high quality shop). A very good 
	paint shop should be able to match your color with no problem
	so don't sweat about having the front end repainted. Just be
	sure not to skimp on things in an effort to get the whole thing
	repainted. Who cares what it looks like if shakes like a roller
	coaster when you do more than 30?
