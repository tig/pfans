Howdy,

Thought I'd give you an update on how we have been doing out here lately
in autocrossing (I won't bother calling it racing for fear of the track
guys flaming me to death;  wait till I start road racing, then see what
I call you track guys! :])

A couple of weeks ago at Whistler, we had our Regional #4 I think it is.
I got my butt kicked brutally hard.  It was a standing start affair and
I just don't have it in me to launch the car hard anymore.  On the video,
I lost 1.5 seconds off the line to the other 944T's in my class.  Other
than that, I was quicker in the sweepers, even on my street tires, but 
I was slower out of the hairpins.  I stayed in 2nd, they downshifted to
1st, up-down, up-down.  It was a crappy tight course.  I took DFL, 3.6
seconds back from the 1st place finisher.  Paul drove our friend's 240SX
and did rather well placing 3rd in Pax class out of 7 cars.  Just to make
it 100% clear that I sucked, I even got beat by a Ferrari 348 on PZero
tires, not even race tires.  Paul clocked in at 55.1, I was 58.6.

This weekend we headed out to the NWR PCA autocross at Bremerton.  We
had a blast.  It was a high 2nd gear, low 3rd gear course.  A few
technical areas where you had to slow down to go fast.  We had great
assistance from Glen Hernandez.  The local 944T guys are cocky in a fun
kind of way.  They were giving us a hard time before the event, talking
about how they like seeing other 944Ts come out to play so they can have
more butts to kick, and comments at the driver's meeting about how the
Canadians should get a 5 second head start.  It was all in fun.  We, of
course, had to beat them then and did beat them.  In the four timed runs,
I got down to 58.3, Paul down to 57.1, but punted a cone.  That was still
faster than the local 944T fast guy who ran mid 59.  The guy that said
we should get the head start ran something like 61 or 63.

In the fun runs, I experimented a bit and got down to a 56.5 and Paul also
got down to 56.5, but hit a cone again.  Darren Foo and Kerwin Law (new
guys) got down to 59's, but a little dirty.  Darren actually got a very
fast 58.?, but hit a few too many cones.

The biggest difference between this event and the others has been my
struggle with power-on oversteer.  I made some small changes that made
a dramatic difference.  Before, I was afraid to go even 75% throttle
exiting a bend, now I have complete confidence in the car.  Slaloms
were areas I tip-toed through for fear of spinning (and I usually still
spun), but now I can attack them with confidence.

Glen H. that day ran 54.? dirty and 55.0 clean.  FTD was Jodi Fordahl
in an RS America with a 52.4.

On Sunday, Paul, Kerwin and Darren ran at the Clothing Optional event
at Kent.  Paul did very, very well placing 2nd in O/SP with a blistering
57.1 on street tires.  Kerwin and Darren were both down in the 63's and
64's.  Still, out of the novices, they did quite well with Kerwin taking
home a 4th place trophy.  I decided to sleep after having a good day on
Saturday :)  FTD was Ron Babb I think driving to a stunning 51.? in
the Europa (I think that's what that beautiful car is).

On Monday, we headed down to Mission for a track day.  The way the event
was organized, we were not happy about, so we decided not to run.  We
did come out to support the other 944Ts out there and to support our
group of PDM Racing.  The shocker of the day was Lou G's 89 944T.  He
had recently put in the Cup springs and new wheels/tires.  They are the
mesh GT2 style wheels for the Boxster.  They look fantastic.  It
was expected that Don Nimi's Supra TT with the boost cranked would be
untouchable as it has been for all track events.  Well, not this time!
Lou sling shot by him on the exit to the straight and it didn't matter
what boost Don dialed in, he couldn't catch Lou's car.  Ultimately,
the Supra was faster than the 944T down the straight, but it took one 
hell of a run at the 944T for it to do that.  Lou's car has Paul's 
test pipe in, new shocks all around, turbo cup springs and Weltmeister
chips.  Don's Supra has boost at 18psi, stock turbos, HKS exhaust, HKS
air filter, head light removed, down pipe and test pipe.  The Supra should
be making an honest 400hp, but it has to lug around 3800lbs.

The funnest sight was watching Lou out brake four cars going into the tight
hairpin, one of the four cars being the Supra!  Way to go Lou!

One bad thing did happen to a fellow 944T driver, his heater valve broke
and sprayed coolant all over the track.  He eventually took the heater
valve right out and piped it across to get a seal.  I helped him bleed
his system and he was on his way.  It was a stock 86T that did very
well against the late model imports (Preludes, etc.)

Hopefully, the aspects of driving I learnt this weekend from the National
caliber drivers will assist me in keeping my 4th place standing right
now which is being threatened by this "faster every event" Corvette on
R1's.  Who knows, maybe I can get into 3rd or 2nd like I had at the
beginning of the year.  1st is all sewn up by the TT 911.

Farzaan.
