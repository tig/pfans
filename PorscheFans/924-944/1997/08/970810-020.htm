Then, Gregor says:

Pressing the accelerator pedal before starting the engine has _no_ affect 
whatsoever.  All it controls is a butterfly valve, the throttle position 
sensor and two microswitches (idle and WOT)  which are ignored by the DME
until the engine is cranked.  Ditto for CIS cars ('81 and earlier 924's).

This is an old technique used on carbureted cars, which will shoot a bit
of fuel from the accelerator pump into the throat of the carb mechanically
when you pump the pedal. 

The owner's manual specifically states not to press the pedal when starting.

Don't take this as a flame, just an attempt to clarify.
