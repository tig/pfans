More 944 questions...
With all I've read about Malm's 2-step wax, I looked for some and 
couldn't find it too easily locally: is Zymol in the same class? How 
about price - Z is about $20 a bottle.
My 84 944 seems to be losing a couple of drops of oil from the rear seal 
each night. The local garage quoted a fee of $500, my dealer said $700, 
for replacement (entails taking out the engine or something). However, 
the former also suggested, given the nature of the problem, that I try 
an additive called StopLeak to stop the leak, which is more a cosmetic 
problem than a serious one. Any advice?
Otherwise, I love my newly acquired 944 (though I have 968 envy); it 
makes me enjoy the 80's in ways I didn't think possible. Also handles 
great on the roads out of Rancho Santa Fe. Although it did inspire me to 
buy a Duran Duran album, kind of naff...
Regards,
Neil
