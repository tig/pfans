Perhaps it's a problem of perception. Have you compared torque curves for
the 8- and 16-valve motors? My guess is that the 16-valve has more torque
at every RPM, but the delta is much higher above 4000. In other words, the
16-valve motor is so much stronger at higher RPM that the low-end *feels*
weak.

I used to play with watercooled VWs a few years ago, and that was
definitely the case with their 8V/16V motors. The 8Vs felt stronger off the
line because of the flat torque curve, but the 16Vs actually had more power
and torque all the way across the band, from idle to redline.
