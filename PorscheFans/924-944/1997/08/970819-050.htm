This is a good price - a local shop with reasonable prices
charges $169 for the basic unit, and $75 for the hands-free
attachment.

Thanks much

Next item - How about a toe gauge?

     The splash pan (I call it undertray, but you can call it underwear if 
     you want to) provides some aerodynamic advantage, and it has vents to 
     channel air (and debris) to specific parts of the engine.  My first 
     944 had one, but my 951 does not (but's it's supposed to).  I was 
     worried at first, but my mechanics put my mind at ease and told me 
     that it was no big deal, especially since a lot of people take them 
     off anyway (for ease of maintenance access and questionably improved 
     cooling).  In fact, I've checked under every 944/951 I've come across 
     and I'd have to say that a third of them are running bare-bottomed.  
     So I wouldn't worry about it too much, but I guess it would be nice to 
     have one.  By the way, I also need the chin spoiler that goes right in 
     front of the undertray, so if anyone knows where I can get one, let me 
     know!
     
     Ben

Just a quick question about the splash pan, or windage tray, or whatever 
it is that it's called. It's the one that bolts to the sheetmetal below 
the radiator and extends under the oil pan. My car hasn't had one since 
I bought it some 7 months ago, and I haven't seen any strange things 
happen, but I figured the factory put it there for a reason. Does anyone 
know if it serves any purpose other than as a debris-catcher?
     
My second question concerns the heater valve location. I guess I started 
saving some of the great advice on this list too late, because I know 
someone posted a method to relocate the valve to a location other than 
on top of the clutch. Mine's started leaking ever-so-slightly, so I 
figure it would be smart to move it when I replace it. If anyone can 
point me in the right direction in the archives or remembers the item, 
I'd appreciate it.
     
TIA
