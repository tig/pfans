This is a re-occurring theme on this list, so thought I would throw in my two 
cents..
Last fall my wife and I bought our '86 944 knowing little about it's problems, 
history, value, etc.. It was mostly my dream to own a Porsche, we barely swung 
the $4900 to buy it. Then I found this list, and educated myself about common 
problems which occur in decade old 944's. Over time, and not much at that, I 
discovered that our Porsche had most of these common problems (ball joints, 
engine seals, belts, electrical, etc..) Since we love to drive this car, and 
certainly can't afford a newer one, I have justified the repairs because we 
plan to own the vehicle for a long time. Since most of the repairs I have done 
will last another 100k, I am investing in the vehicle, and its use (the fun 
part). In addition, I am learning a lot in the process. Repairs can also be 
taken as opportunities to enhance performance.  This is not the same way that 
I treat our '87 Jeep Cherokee (hey, we have to drive something in these 
Vermont winters!). I spend as little on repairs to this vehicle as I possible. 
It is not made to last, and any substantial repairs would easily outlast the 
body. If you are in it for the long haul with your 944, I think it is 
certainly worth the effort to maintain it. Certainly if you are paying a 
Porsche dealer to perform repairs, you would be better off buying a vehicle 
who's past owner had done the R&R.

Happy Motoring!

Ezra (who's wife doesn't necessarily agree that time and $ spent on repairs 
      is worth it)
