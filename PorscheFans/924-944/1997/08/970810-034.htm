<< Thanks to all who responded to my query about whether anyone had State
Farm
 Insurance.  I confronted my agent with the fact that others have their 944s
 insured with State Farm and with $250 to $500 comprehensive/collision.  I
was
 told that the company varies it's requirements by state and that southern
 California is a very high risk area.  $1000 comp/collision is all that I can
 get here.  I told her that I will shop around and get back to her. >>

Claus,

I spoke to a State Farm agent that I know (not mine . . . . . I have AAA) and
got an interesting perspective on how they do business.  It seems insurance
companies
(and specifically State Farm) continually review the amounts of coverage they
have written by type (commercial, residential, auto, etc.) and they vary
their business decisions based on this "portfolio" the same as a stock
investor would.  Sometimes they wish to carry a larger percentage of
residential policies and sometimes they wish the percentages to swing in a
different direction such as commercial or auto.  The bottom line is they
continually have changes in their desired "portfolio" and the way they get
the percentages to change is to offer discounts in the desired area and make
changes (higher rates, more stringent requirements, etc.) in the other
coverages that make them less desireable.  This is why sometimes you can get
a "deal" in one area and they could care less about writing new policies in
another area.  I guess from a business perspective it makes sense but from a
personal level it seems like they're just jerking us around.  Just my $.02.
