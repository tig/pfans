Hello,  I am driving an '87 944 for a month now
and am having some questions, any help would be greatly appreciated !

I am having
a problem with the heating in my 944, it keeps blowing
hot air even though I turn the temperature all the way down and
have not turned it on yet. I think the temperature
control still does work since I can heard it switch when
moving the temp control, what is wrong ? Is it possible that some
valve is stuck or something ? And what can I do about it ?

Also my airco has not been used for 8 months; how can I check
the condition, reservoir or whatever or can I just turn it
on and see what happens ?

I am going to change tires soon, I am now having Dunlop SP 8000
tires but I have been somewhere today where they sell Pirelli 
Mo tires, they said they were specifically for Porsche; high speed with
improved strenght in the middle to prevent extra wear in the 
middle of the tire. Also these Pirellis were not as expensive,
about $900 (all in) for all 4 tires, 17" 255 40R17/205 50R17.
The Dunlops would cost me $1150 !

Oh yeah one more thing, my targa is malfunctioning, one of the 
white plastic wheels (inside the mechanism) that moves the thing
up has lost it's tooth. Anybody has a spare he can miss ? 

Thanks for reading,

Gerco Marsch
