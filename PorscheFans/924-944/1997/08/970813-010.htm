I'm going to have to pick up a few points here.

Not what most of the people I've spoken to think.

They have to make money , or else no more Porsche at all , so what so wrong 
with that.

Can't comment on this , but from the photos I've seen I wouldn't want to sit in 
the back the way the roof slopes down.

The new engine is 300bhp  from 3.4 litres , which is more than 285 from the 
current 993 (?)
The main reason for water called was they wanted to go 4 valve and the 
aircooled just got too hot.I guess it had something to do with noise as well 
as the old thing is a bit loud by modern standards.
.. Any new engine will be 'unproven' , do you suggest we stick with the same one 
for ever .......

My local dealer already has 25 firm orders and a lot more interest.
