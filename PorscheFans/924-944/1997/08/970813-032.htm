Hello all,

     I have an '87 951 with 90k miles.  I have a couple of questions.

1)  I am replacing my rear shocks.  Would anyone recommend KYBs (to 
replace SACHS) or is it worth the money to upgrade to Bilsteins?  Also, 
my car seems to squat a bit more than normal upon acceleration. Is this 
due to the worn rear shocks or are my torsion bars worn as well?

2)  A vibration can be felt throughout the entire only at 2000 rpm only 
when the car is in gear.  In neutral, the vibration is not present.  
Obviously it is in the drivetrain.  I recently repacked my cv joints and 
found that they are badly worn (a couple of them had gashes in the 
metal).  I know that I need to replace them but they are not making the 
noises typical of worn joints.  Could this be my problem or is something 
else the culprit?

3) How does one go about lubing the passenger side door handle to fix 
the "hard to squeeze" problem?

Any advice or help is gladly accepted and greatly appreciated...

Thanks in advance,

Lee Weissman
