>Richard , if the UK 81 spec has mechanical injection like my 80 Australian
spec,I would suspect low voltage to the fuel pump relay or poor earth . The
931 has an electronic relay which sends a 2 second burst of fuel to the
injection while cranking then cuts off until the engine starts. I believe
that it is to stop the pumps if the car crashes. The relay earths through
the overboost switch which is located on the side of the air intake that
runs across the top of the engine.If the wastegate fails the overboost
switch opens at about 1.5bar and cuts the fuel pumps.

My overboost switch gained resistance which caused the pump relay to cycle
on and off and sometimes not cut in. It was difficult to isolate
(understatement)

Check the resistance across the overboost switch . It should be zero.I am
told that there is no way to check the relay itself and they cost A$125 so
the switch is the first thing to check. Hope this helps.(guess who bought a
new relay)

Top speed by the book is 240KPH or about 140MPH

Maybe someone can help me . I sent a message a couple of weeks ago in the
middle of changing mt ISP and didn't see it on the newsgroup.

My 931 with about 100,000 miles makes a noise under load from the gearbox
area at wheel speed, loudest at 35MPH . The noise is a constant rumble
which does not come in suddenly but increases with load. I have replaced
wheel bearings and all 4 CVs. There is no diff whine,all gears are quiet,
and synchros work well. Oil was recently changed in the box to Mobil GL5
80W-90 and there were no big bits on the drain plug. After the CV's were
changed the noise was less and lost the "wonka-wonka" characteristic.

My question is - Can you always hear the CV's under load in a 931? The
noise does not come in suddenly like usual diff backlash but builds as
torque increases. No noise in a "neutral state" but the noise returns at a
lower level on overrun? I suspect (hope!)it is the CVs but am open to
opinions. 

By the way ,mine is an 80 931 bought January 1997,petrol blue with brown
trim, Australian spec is European including 4wheel discs,sport suspension ,
15 inch snowfake wheels, and no side reflectors or two tone paint like the
NA spec. Engine is 170hp plus with mechanical injection. It has had all the
usual problems fuel gauge, window switches, low voltage, cold start module,
engine mounts including cracked LH engine bracket(boy that was fun)BUT
engine and turbo are fine with virtually zero oil consumption. I now use
Castrol SyntronR full synthetic 10W 60 with no consumption or leak
problems. Mobil 1 5W-50 which is sold in Australia is too thin and idling
oil pressure too low , although Mobil technical assistance said not to worry.

Re aircon on 924 . For low idle fix you can get air con "idle up switch"
for Corolla 85 onwards. The switch is fitted to the vacuum line between
distributor and intake manifold. It is connected electrically to the air
con compressor wire and earthed. It opens with current and steps up the
idle. All  you need is a bit of vacuum hose , a Tpiece , the switch which
is $20 in Oz and the ability to wire it in. It takes all of 30 minutes. 
sorry about the length but I killed a few birds.
