I don't know how you can over rev these engines.  Besides, the 16 valve 
engine is "designed" to run at higher RPM.  However, no engine should be 
run at high RPMs when cold.  

First, this is one of those instances where an attorney should have been 
enlisted long ago instead of a mechanic.  However, it may not be too late.

Do you have an entity analogous to PCNA, or do you use PCNA (Porsche Cars 
North America) as a official contact?  There may be some help there.  
They can also give you the "Porsche" stand on cylinder honing, care, and 
feeding of your car.

As far as I understand, no honing of cylinders should be done to the 
block.  I think it can be done, but the procedure is anything but 
standard.  Who authorized this work?  Did you specifically instruct the 
rebuilder to do this?  I am not sure that protects them from liability if 
they did.  This is where the attorney is required.  Do not waste time, do 
it!

Your attorney will know who is responsible for what, and I know in the 
USA, that the dealer can be held responsible for "lemon" cars (not that 
your car is a lemon).  This could still, despite all of your grief, 
thrust the ultimate responsibility back to the original dealer.  You are 
possibly entitled to compensation for loss of time with this car as well. 
 See your attorney!

Please keep us informed with your progress.

Good luck,

Marv

>(first major problem, warranty doesn't pay).  The machine shop says the

>Anyway, order idlers, tighteners, belts, waterpump, motormounts, rings,

>1400$ (anybody found second major problem yet?)  Supposedly, on these cars
>you can't touch the cylinders because you de-ciliconise them (as when the

>true!!!  This means i've spent around 5000$ and now I need to replace the
>motor because it's garbage because of the machine shop.
>
>Please help, when the garage sends the bill for removing and reinstalling
>the motor it will be 2000$.  Which sends the bills up to 7000$ plus new
>motor which is 4000$.  That's doubling the price of my car and still no

>Sorry my story took so long but thank you in advance for any advice or
