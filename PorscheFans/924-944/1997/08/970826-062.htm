Thanks to all who provided advise about how to eliminate the wheel shimmy
after replacing rotors.  Shimmy was felt in the steering wheel.

All rotors had less than .0005 runout.  Rotors, wheel hubs and wheels were
all cleaned and bolted together without debris between.  I did notice that
the front rotors fit loosely on the hub bolts, there was no tight alignment
fit.  I suspect that this caused an out of balance condition.

My alignment shop has an on-the-car wheel balancer and they balanced the
front wheels this way last Saturday.  I had the rear wheels rebalanced on a
computer alignment machine.  It is now as smooth as a baby's . . .   When I
have nothing better to do, I'll place the hub/rotor assembly in the lathe
with two live centers to determine if it is balanced.
