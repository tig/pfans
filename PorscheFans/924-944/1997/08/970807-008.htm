Greetings.

Am I correct in remembering that somebody said that the O2 sensor for the
951 and the Ford Mustang is the same?  I replaced my O2 sensor last summer
w/ the universal 3-wire, however my solder job was very poor, and my car is
hesitating largely throughout the 2900-4500rpm range, therefore I think
that it is time to repair or replace it.

I am also getting new tires this month.  (my steering wheel shakes back and
forth between 50 and 70 heavily and as the speed goes up it tends to
increases in its frequency.  I have checked the air, alignment and wheel
balancing, therefore it is either tires (which are getting old) or ball
joints.  My problem is that it doesn't always shake, sometimes its
ludicrous, other times nothing at all, there does not seem to be any
connection (would the temperature of the ground affect my tires in a large
way?).

My PS hose leaks like a 90yr old man w/ prostate trouble!  It seems to
spray my exhaust manifold and I get some very strong smells in the cockpit
(I think of my Porsche as a land bound jet!).  I can't find where the darn
thing is leaking, and I am losing friends who are tired of the smell and
the burn they get in their eyes!  I have looked at the price of hoses and
think they are just plain stupid.  Is there a generic hose type I can
switch this out with.  What is entailed in this operation.  I should think
if I remove the reservoir, and the hoses I will have to bleed the system
(is this involved?).  Any other tips or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Sorry for bandwidth (I feel like a fool for typing that because I just
wasted more, and then even more so for this sentence!)

Tariq
86 951 (sorta of red, kinda smelly, certainly leaky, but unmistakably
Porsche!)
