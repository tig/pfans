Hey guys,
  Well, it was bound to happen.  I was parking at the store today and I
pulled up behind a pickup truck.  About the time I turned the key off the
truck started backing up.  I tried blowing the horn but it didn't work.
Just as I was reaching for the key to start the car so I could back up he
ran all over the front end of my '86 944.  It dented in the nose panel
pretty good.  The guy got out and he was real apologetic.  Must have said
I'm sorry twenty times.  Now I don't know if the guy was drunk or not but
there was a cooler in the bed of his truck and a couple of empty Bud cans.
Anyway I didn't call the law.  I hate the damn cops as much as anybody and
I don't want to see nobody go to jail (except OJ).  I don't think the cops
in this bass ackward state (AL) will investigate an accident that occurs on
private property.  I got all the pertinent info from him: address, phone #,
DL#, tag#, insurance co.#.  Also got a couple of witnesses.

  When I first saw my car my first reaction was OH S***!  Then after I
thought about it for a minute another idea hit me.  FREE PAINT JOB!  So I
submit the following questions to the list:

1. Would the Porsche dealer be the place to get the highest possible estimate?

2. If I take the car to an ordinary body shop can I demand that they use
authentic Porsche parts?

3. Could I get a used nose panel from a reputable Porsche dismantler and
install it myself?

4. Are there any other options that I should consider?

  I appreciate any input.  Thanks!

Terry
