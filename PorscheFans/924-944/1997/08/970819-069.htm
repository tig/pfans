Lee, =


Sorry to hear about your car.  It must be especially hard with a limited
edition.  To give you some hope, here is a story about a friend of mine.

Many moons ago, he got his new (6 months old) Scout stuck on the ocean mu=
d
flats in Mexico.  The tide came in and covered the car.  They tied a rope=

to the bumper and got the local mechanic with a war surplus amphibious du=
ck
to tow it out.  The mechanic pulled the plugs and towed the Scout around =
in
gear to pump the water out of the engine.  He changed all the fluids, gav=
e
it a fresh water bath and my friend drove it back to the U.S..  When he h=
ad
the dealer check it out, the dealer couldn't find anything wrong with it.=
 =

About thirty years later, he still has the Scout and it still runs.
