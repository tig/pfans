It is a very comforting feeling to hear of even these "light-weight" (no
offense intended) Porsches hitting the AutoBahn in such a drastic manner
and not blowing up.  I have heard of multiple stories of U.S soldiers
(even met one guy) in Germany blowing up their Corvettes as they had no
oil coolers and at sustained >125mph speeds the engines started frying
themselves.

Chevrolet switched to Mobil 1 as a factory fill since it was the only oil
that let them get by w/o an oil cooler(the Mobil 1 WWW site used to talk
about this), but that worked only in the US where prolonged fast cruising
is not really possble.
