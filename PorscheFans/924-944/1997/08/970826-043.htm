Russ,
     I installed the mustang Lambda sensor last nigh, Bosche 13913. It was a 
bit difficult to access the O2 sensor, so I removed the starter. This freed up 
enough room to use an adjustable wrench for removal and installation of the O2 
sensor. I soldered the old wire/connector harness to the new sensor. My 30Watt 
temp controlled iron was not enough to do the job, so I used an 80Watt weller 
soldering iron sold for stained glass work. I staggered the solder joints to 
help prevent shorting in the event the heat shrink tubing I used becomes 
compromised. Staggering the joints also allows the original silicone/glass 
sheath to be slid over the new joints further protecting the wires. Since my 
wheels are currently being re-finished, I was only able to run the engine for 
about 5 minutes, the vehicle is currently on jack stands. As such I can not 
proclaim this a successful replacement until my wheels return and I can take 
it on a drive. Please let me know what you find out.

Thanks,
       Ezra
