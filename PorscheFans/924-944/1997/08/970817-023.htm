Thanks to everyone who responded to my questions about buying a 944
Porsche. I think I have located two that are suitable, and am planning
to take one of them to a "Porsche" mechanic to have it checked out.

My question, and I apologize for my ignorance is - how about an 86 944
with an automatic?? I always thought of a sports car as needing to be a 
straight, but I have to admit after driving the automatic - convenience
might count - What I would like to know is there any stigma attached to
driving an automatic Porsche?? I'm a 43 year old male and still like to
drink my coffee enroute to my destinations - hard to do in a straight.
Also, does anyone have any experience with automatics as far as upkeep
is concerned? With a clutch job coming in at $1500 to 2000 - an
automatic might look pretty good. Anyway, opnions are welcomed!

Again, thanks for the responses, I'm looking forward to getting my first
Porsche real soon!

Marshall
