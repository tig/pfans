Um...  Can I take my 951 to Norway and get 20k out of it?  1986 951,
122k miles, excellent shape, just had the nose repainted.
Like, wow!

Sometimes I'm glad Norwegian car prices are as high as they are. Having
paid
$12.500 for my 924, I can justify keeping it in a shape that would make
Ferry himself proud. Imagine what you could do to an $18.000 '83 944! Or
a
$27.000 '86 951, or a $50.000 '87 911 Carrera! Suddenly an investment of
$4000 to get it in tip-top shape doesn't seem too steep.

How are 944s treated in the US? Even with the car prices being what they
are
over here, most 944s and even 911s are treated like dirt (or so it
seems).
Most 944s I wouldn't even offer a glance, and many 911s are sadly
neglected
as well. They are mostly owned by spoiled brats and yuppies, I guess. :/
