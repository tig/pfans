I believe Sekurit is just the manufacturer's name, not a coating.  My Turbo
S had one as original equipment, and when I had it replaced a few months
ago, the replacement was also a tinted Sekurit with the built in antenna.
It seems to me, the tinting is between the glass layers, and not something
that can be scraped off, but I may be wrong (wouldn't be the first time and
won't be the last).
