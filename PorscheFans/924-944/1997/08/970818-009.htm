Hello everyone. This is my second request for help with this problem.  I'll
try to make this version shorter:

My 1984 944 with 92K miles suddenly had the oil pressure warning light,
brake fluid warning light, and brake lining warning light - all come on at
the same time.  I immediately checked the oil level which was fine (Oil
change 2K prior), the brake fluid level was also fine.  I'd changed the


front pads and sensors just 1 month prior.  The oil pressure guage showed
no appreciable change and still showed 3.5-4 bar.  No change in engine
tone, etc.

Upon proceeding home, I noticed that turning the steering wheel,
temporarily made all the warning lights go out.

A possible contributing factor is the power steering fluid leak present at
the resevoir.  I caused the deterioration of the right sway bar bushing
which I replaced.

Could this leak have also caused the breakdown o some wiring harness or
something which somehow connects all of these warning lights?  Is it
something alltogether unrelated?

I hope someone out there has some input or ideas on how to diagnose the
problem.

thanks
