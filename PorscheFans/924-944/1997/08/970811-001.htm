Several of us P-philes were sitting around this weekend talking about,
what else, Porsches.  The topic turned to the 944.  The general
consensus here in Southwest Florida is the 944 will increase in value in
the next year or two.  Reason being, really nice ones are becoming
increasingly harder to find.  Secondly, and sadly to say, a majority of
the 944's are not well-maintained and, because of this, usually end up
at the salvage yards.  I paid $4,000.00 for my 85.5 and spent another
$9,000.00 on full restoration with me doing most of the work.  Call me
crazy, or call it love, but my wife and I can enjoy this vehicle for
many years to come and I would not trade it for anything.  It is
immaculate inside and out, (thinking about entering a Concours event).
