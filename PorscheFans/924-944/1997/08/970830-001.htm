P-fans:

Here's another variation on the (endless) speeding ticket thread.  In an
effort to avoid tickets, I bought all those police organization stickers for
my car.  I promptly got 2 tickets despite having 3 mounted prominently on my
left rear window.  So much for that idea!

My wife and I are both doctors.  A patient of hers mentioned that he and his
colleagues go out of their way not to ticket physicians.  This surprised me.
 Anyway, I can get physician plates for each of our cars for only $10 extra
per year.  Does anyone out there think that this would really help?
 Otherwise, I would rather not, since I am not interested in furthering the
idea that all doctors are rich bastards who drive red Porsches!
