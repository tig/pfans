I used to have an '81 924 and it, too, was missing the
alternator cooling hose. The path the hose was supposed
to take was from underneath the nose (there was a little
plastic mounting bracket for it under there) down to the
alternator bracket. I can't comment too much on if it's
really needed or not, but I can say that the alternator
was just about the only thing I didn't have to replace
on that car. Admittedly, I think the PO had replaced it
with a bigger one and had used an aftermarket bracket.
As far as I could tell, this bracket had no provision
for the cooling hose. I'm sure that's why they ripped
the whole thing outta there.

On a not completely different note, this morning I saw
a 924 turbo on the road. I realize there are some 931
owners on the list, but they're still pretty rare. I've
only seen three in my life. Anyway, I beeped as I went
by and the guy just beeped back, waving and smiling. I
guess my point is: We're all pretty cool!
