Jesper ,

Sounds like maybe bad tourque tube bearings or a bent shaft. You're sending
a lot of power to that transaxel. It might be fighting back.

Have a race shop check it out for you. You'll need to find a mechanic with
good drivetrain knowledge.

Good luck.

Is my transaxel about to break????

I have a 87 951, fitted with S engine
It's very well chipped, and tuned. It's putts out
325 HP on the wheel, and 358 HP on the engine.

358 HP is mayby to much. I had to fitt a brand new new transmission
with diff. locking, and i also had to put put 2 new driveaxel (from
gearbox to wheel)

So what may be bee the next???
I think the transaxel is about to break. This is how the car behave:

When the car is in neutral with the clutch is up, the whole car shakes,
espacially around 1.200 rpm, At higher RPM, you cant really feel it.
But when you put the clutch down, still in neutral, the shaking
disapears complete.
When the car is cold, the shaking is not so bad.

When you drive the car, it acts pretty normal, the problem is only as I
described it.

Does anywhone have any ideas or opinion, could it be the clutch??, it
has done about 20k miles.

Please let me hear from you guys over there, there ain't to many "real
cars" over here.
