Hello Michael,

> to point me to a previous list or other source.  I would like to know how to
> bleed the brakes on my 92 968 coupe.  I will participate in my 1st driver's

With two people it's very easy.

Go the local autoparts place and buy a 'one man brake bleeder' kit.
Not the vacuum one, but one that's just a cup and a length of hose.
Lisle makes it, and it should cost less than $5.00. Also, if you 
can get it, Ate or Performance Friction brake fluid is good. If you
can't get it in time, use Castrol GT-LMA, that should be available
at a good auto parts place.

To bleed the brakes, it's easiest if you can put the entire car
up on jackstands and remove all the wheels. If not, you'll have
to jack up a corner, remove the wheel, bleed the caliper, install
the wheel, lower the car and repeat. It's up to you. 

If you're intested, Sears usually sells a large floor jack and
2 jack stands in a kit for like $100. Get two more jackstands and
you're in business.

Your car has dual piston calipers, that means that each 1/2 of the
caliper needs to be bled. The procedure is to put a box end wrench
(11mm on my car) on the bleed nipple, put the hose of the brake bleeder
on the nipple, open the bleed nipple about 1/2 turn, and have someone
press the brake pedal down. With the one man brake bleeder, you don't
have to close the bleed nipple between pumps. Since you're flushing the
brake fluid, not bleeding the brakes, I think that 2 or 3 pumps per
caliper should be enough. Close the bleed nipple, remove the hose, and
do the next caliper. Monitor the brake fluid level in the master
cylinder to make sure it doesn't get below the min mark.

For bleed order, do the right rear, then left rear, then right front, 
then left front.

One final thing, if you've never bled the clutch slave cylinder,
and you have 50K miles on your car, I recommend you do that too.
If the car is up on jackstands, all you have to do is remove the
starter (not that tough, be sure to remove the battery leads)
and then you can get at the slave cyl bleed nipple. Caution - 
if you do bleed the slave cyl, be sure to keep the brake fluid
reservoir completely full. The brake res feeds the clutch master
cyl from a small area in the front. For some strange reason, that
area only gets fluid when the brake res is full.

Happy bleeding,
