 It could well be that your battery is giving up the ghost and is not =
putting out
enough voltage to pick the relay in question "with authority", or it =
could just be
a faulty relay...

Good way to check is to open up the fuse box cover (under the hood) and =
have
a friend turn the key to the offending position and off, while you have =
a finger on
each of the relays in turn. You will be able to feel the clicking relay =
through your
fingertips...

Good Luck!
