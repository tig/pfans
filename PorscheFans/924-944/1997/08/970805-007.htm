Hi Everyone:

After all the problems I'm having with my 944S, I'm ready for some good news.

But I'm pretty sure I'm not going to hear it with this next question.

This past Friday, after inching along in traffic for 30 minutes, the clutch started 
slipping--no judder or shudder, just old-fashioned slipping (engine revs up, car 
goes nowhere, followed by a thick clutch lining odor that made my wallet faint). 
Never did that before. When the traffic let up, and I was driving quickly along 
again, it cooled down enough and stopped the slipping completely.

Two days later, after about an hour of spirited driving, the slipping was back big 
time. I parked the car and haven't used it since.

The only work done recently that was clutch-related was bleeding the hydraulic 
system after a new master cylinder. The clutch also apparently engages very high 
off the floor--I'm used to clutches that engage about halfway up. After driving 
manuals for 13 years I'm pretty sure I'm doing it correctly!

Overheating a clutch enough to make it slip in half an hour is the sign of a 
problem somewhere. Is this slipping problem possibly due to an adjustment of some 
sort, or should I be prepared to cash out my mutual funds (again)?

Thanks for any help you can offer,

Chris
