  Yesterday I brought our '86 N/A 944 in for inspection. I went to the
dealer =

we purchased the car from thinking they could deal properly with the
Sekurit =

coating on the inside of the windshield. I carefully explained how soft t=
he

coating was, and even had them write the details on the service contract.=
 =

Since they were busy, they gave me a '90 corvette as a loaner so they cou=
ld

take their time to do the inspection. This was at lunch, I drove back to
work, =

not to bad for a loaner, lots of power, but has bump steering and is not =
so

nimble in the handling dept.... At 5:00pm I picked up my wife from home. =
We

were going to pick up our 944, and then go out to dinner to celebrate our=

2nd =

wedding anniversary. I dropped off the keys for the vette with the
sales-guy =

and proceeded to the service counter. The service manager tells me he has=

good =

and bad news. The good news is they are not charging for the inspection a=
nd

the bad news is they aren't going to pass it due to the tint on the side =

windows. I talk with the service manager for a while, and explain we boug=
ht

the car their, and why didn't they tell us about it when they sold the ca=
r
to =

us,etc.... I finally decide he is not worth dealing with, and my wife and=
 I
go =

out to the car to leave.
  I glanced at the windshield and right where the inspection sticker used=

to =

be is a big yellow gooey mess. Subsequent discussions with the owner of t=
he

business get us nowhere, they were unwilling to admit to any wrongdoing,
and =

refused to take responsibility to fix the mess they created on the
windshield. =

The sales guy who sold us the car was kind enough to lend us a dealer
plate, =

but insisted on getting it back the next day (today). Needless to say tha=
t =

killed the evening.
<

Ezra,

Suggest you hold the dealer plate for ransom. =


 I found you can peal off the window tint.  You can pick up the solvent t=
o
take off the tint adhesive from a tint installer.

Since you noted on the service contract that the windshield had a soft
coating, they owe you a new windshield.  If they dig in their heels, you
may want to offer to split the cost of the part with them.  If that does
not work, the following has worked for me.  Tell the owner that you have
faxed a copy of both your sales and service contracts to the local consum=
er
affairs reporter and they are interested in doing a story.  When would be=

the best time for you to show up with the reporter and television crew? =


As a last resort, file against them in Small Claims Court, turn them in t=
o
the Bureau of Automotive Affairs and nail their dealer plate to the wall =
of
your garage.

     Like I described in an earlier post, my '86 951 has been bare-bottomed 
     for quite some time now (at least 4 years).  Throughout those years, 
     I've had the belts squeal maybe 3 times in rainy weather, but those 
     sounds disappeared in a matter of seconds (like before I left my 
     neighborhood), and other than that, still no ill effects.  I've gone 
     150 MPH before lifting off the throttle, and while the nose seemed 
     light and nervous, I don't know if I can attribute it to not having my 
     undertray installed.  I guess it would have to help.  Any comments?
     
     Ben

John, I would bet that the windage tray is only there as an aerodynamic
 aid
(as in reducing the drag coefficient).  It might possibly have some effect 
on airflow through the radiator but I have driven my car with it removed 
for a few days and never noticed any difference.  The other thing it 
probably does is to keep splashing water from soaking the exposed 
alternator and power steering belts.  You might hear some belt squeal in 
wet conditions.
