"...The police have nothing better to do than pull over red Porsches..."

I saw this and had to add to it.

I attended the Indy Car race at Milwaukee back in June and had quite an
interesting trip.  My buddy canceled on me at the last minute and my wife
didn't want to go this year so I was left to myself.  It was about a 5 hour
drive and I was looking forward to the trip.  The red 951 was washed and waxed
and looking very sharp.  The CD player was back in working condition, the CD
holder filled with my favorite selections and the amp bias turned up.  The roof
was removed since it was a beautiful day and the sunglasses cleaned and
polished.  I was set.

I set off early in the morning and was promptly passed by an older Trans Am
doing about 110 mph.  I blended into a line that was slowly adding cars behind
me.  I noticed that the TA was having quite a difficult time maintaining a
straight line and constant speed and that the driver was doing quite a bit of
be bopping around.  I moved in for further examination when I immediately
noticed a second person in the car, sitting on the lap of the driver bouncing
up and down (we won't turn this into a Penthouse forum here).  The driver
frantically motioned for me to "get back in line" whereby I respected his
wishes.

I was about 250 miles from home when I noticed flashing lights behind me.  That
cop couldn't be after me, I was just keeping up with traffic that was doing
about 75-80 mph.  I got into the right hand lane and sure enough, he was on my
butt.  I pulled over and he asked all the standard questions.  He informed me
that he nailed me on VASCAR (what a joke that system is!!!) and that everyone
doing 79 mph was getting a ticket that day.  I informed that it sure didn't
seem to be the case since I was being passed all day long and that as he pulled
me over I was being passed by (2) semi's.  I then said that I get it, it was
the people doing 79 that got the tickets, faster must be OK.  He wasn't
amused.  Minimum Wisconsin fine $145.00.  So much for drinking the good beer
this weekend.

On the way home, I set the speedo at 69 mph (speed limit 65) since I had good
tunes and was really  in no hurry to get home.  I was about 50 miles form home
when a line of 10-12 cars went whizzing by (had to be doing 90).  I drove for
another couple of miles when I saw the flashing lights behind me again.  I
chuckled to myself thinking the cop was after the line of cars that just went
by.  No such luck!  He got on my butt and motioned for me to pull over.  He
walked up and  the conversation went something like this:

cop: Do you know how fast you were going
me: Yes sir, close to the speed limit.
cop: I had you by VASCAR at 68 mph
me: So what?  VASCAR is that accurate?
cop: Speed limit in Wisconsin is 65 mph
me: Yeah, so what.
cop: You were speeding.
me: Where were you?
cop: Up on the entrance ramp behind you.
me: How long you been there?
cop: About an hour.
me: How come you didn't stop the line of cars that went by not 1 minute earlier
doing 90  mph?
cop: I'm not concerned about them, you were the one speeding.
me: No, not true.  I believe you are picking on me because I am out of state
and driving a  red Porsche - right?
cop: No, you were speeding.  Going to have to give you ticket.
me: (not even holdin' a pair of 2's) Fine.  Did you know that the 3 cars behind
me are my  friends and that in court they are going to testify that not 1
minute before I went by  you, a line of 10-12 cars went by doing at least 90
and you chose to let them go?   Why is that?  Is it a kick to pick on law
abiding citizens?
cop: I'll let you go on this one.  Have a nice day sir.
me: (thinking) Jerk!!

I have even been pulled over for no reason other than the cop wants to check
out if I look like someone who could be the owner of a Porsche.  When I explain
that this is trampling all over my constitutional right to no unlawful search
or seizure, they explain that they are just trying to protect me since many
Porsches are stolen.  Yeah - right, thanks so much for the "protection"!!

I have been parked under a shade tree in a park reading a journal and hauled
out of the car (3 cop cars, lights flashing, near work where many people saw
me).  Claimed that they had a phone call on an unusual suspect parked under a
tree.  They wanted to search my car, search me etc...  It all gets so very old.

Sorry about the diatribe.  Sorry about the waste of bandwidth.  It just sickens
me to see the principles that this country was founded on trampled upon by
power hungry zealots.
