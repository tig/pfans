Back in November of 1996, David Harris <76461.2507@CompuServe.COM> posted 
the following fix.. this was one article I saved off for my archives.. 
and I have reposted it below:

-----

The first thing to fail on my 84, way back in 86, was the "window shade"
cargo cover.  It suddenly would't retract, presumably because the internal
spring had broken.  So -- back in 86 -- I just removed two screws and took
it off the car. Today I got around to fixing it.  To get into it, I worked
my pocketknife around the plug in the left end of the core tube, gently
working it up enough to get enough grip to pull it out. Then I dropped a
long solid copper rod -- that I just *happened* to have lying around the
garage -- into the tube and knocked out the peined plug on the other end. 
Actually I knocked out the coil spring assembly that is attached to the
right side plug.  It turned out the coil spring had come loose from the
plug.  I just screwed the plug back into the spring, reassembled
everything (winding tension into the spring by rotating the right side
housing cover before attaching it), and it is functional once again.
