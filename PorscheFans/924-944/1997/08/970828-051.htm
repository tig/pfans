I've just finished editing a tape of autocrossing to show at the Vancouver
Indy race. I think I have the answer to the people who say they used to get
tickets in Volkswagons and other cars and now don't get them in a Porsche.
The Porsche's look slow while going fast. Volkswagons in particular are all
over the course. The car is up on three wheels etc.. 944's look very
settled posting faster runs. Looks like they're out for a Sunday drive but
the times are impressive. A red S2 driven by list member Wes Shew looked
real smooth. Unfortunately smooth doesn't look exciting on tape, or
fortunately for us, to a cop on patrol.

My car made the tape. Not so smooth, all over the course :(
