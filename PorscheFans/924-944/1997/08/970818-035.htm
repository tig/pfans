Well, the dreaded day has arrived. I found my rear plastic window
starting to seperate from the top this morning. So far just an inch or
two has come off, but I fear the tear will grow rapidly. The question is
now what to do. The previous owner told me that he had the plastic
window replaced shortly before I bought the car (Jan '97). He said they
simply pulled out all the old sticthes, put in a new window, and sew it
on. Has anyone else had experience with this? Give the fact that this
had been done within te last year or so I'm kind of discouraged by the
durability.

The other alternative is to replace the entire top, but this sounds like
it would be $$$$! I have the two notorius tears in the reat sides of my
top so this may not be a bad idea. However, the tears have been there
for a while a do not seem to grow (they are app 2-3 inches).

Any advice and experiences on this topic will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
