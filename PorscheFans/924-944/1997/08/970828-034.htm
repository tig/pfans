I remember being in a piece of crap Chrylser with you behind the wheel and
with out doubt that Duster/Demon was out of its' league, so I agree with you
there. About the current Chryslers being safe, give me a break. They are
safe if you don't put a key in the ignition which will set off the airbag,
or the blowing up at speed(see major recalls!) Minivans are dangerous, they
should be outlawed, gotton rid of! They are a plot of Castros to take out
Americans. Those double sliding doors is what really has me scared,
gangbangers probably can't get enough of them, open both doors air condition
people on both sides of the street. But then again at least those Mini vans
don't have those plastic things on the back that light up and say minivan on
it like some of our cars. I saw one guy at the Pocono club race with a NA
944 and his said TURBO, now that is stupid.

Guess what guys and girl, owners of those "death traps" are saying the same
thing about our cars at their local PTA meetings, different strokes for
different folks.
