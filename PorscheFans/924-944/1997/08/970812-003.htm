True, the synthetic oil may not break down, but you still accumulate all 
of the combustion products over time, particularly from the Turbo.  These 
combustion products form corrosive acids as well.

I have said in the past, and will say again; the 3000 mile oil change is 
cheap insurance, but its your car, and your wallet.
