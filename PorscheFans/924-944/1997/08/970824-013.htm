Although I have only pulled the motor out per the manual (primarily due to
lack of an overhead hoist), it certainly seems that if you are willing to
remove the hood then it should be possible to remove it from above.  The
only potential problem I can think of might be a lack of clearance between
the oil pan and aft side of the front cross member which may prevent you
from moving the engine forward enough for the clutch housing to clear the
firewall.  If you still need to drop the cross member then it would seem
you wouldn't gain much.  I would sure be interested to know if it does work
since disconnecting the steering rack and unbolting that cross member is
much more difficult than removing the hood.
