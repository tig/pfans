<<Just a quick question about the splash pan, or windage tray, or
whatever it is that it's called. It's the one that bolts to the
sheetmetal below
the radiator and extends under the oil pan. My car hasn't had one since
I bought it some 7 months ago, and I haven't seen any strange things
happen, but I figured the factory put it there for a reason. Does anyone
know if it serves any purpose other than as a debris-catcher?>>

The 944 has a very low Cd which I believe is .32. A major contributor is
the belly pan. You are also probably not getting as much downforce from
your spoiler if you are running without it. It is also one of the
reasons the RF motor mount fails because it traps heat from the exhaust
manifold. Your call...

     Yeah, I believe it had 12,900 miles and was going for $43,000!  The ad 
     above it also had an '86 951 with low miles (~31K?), but I don't think 
     it was selling for half the amount the other 951 owner was asking for. 
      Gee, I wonder how much an '86 951 extended-cab dually pickup truck 
     would cost!

In the new Pano (Funny looking Boxster on the cover) there is a '86 951 in 
the classifieds for $46K (If I remember correctly....)  It had REALLY low 
miles, but still!!!
