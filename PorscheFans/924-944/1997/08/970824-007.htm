    Sigh... Much as I like Hondas and the people who drive them,
    it's hard to find a Honda owner who really knows anything about
    cars.

    Anyway, here's the answer:

    In the old days, anti-seize contained lead.  If you put it on
    your spark-plug threads, it could find its way into the exhaust,
    where it would damage your oxygen sensor.

    These days, most (if not all) anti-seize compounds are lead-free
    and are safe for use on the spark-plug threads of cars that have
    oxygen sensors.  In fact, they even SAY "oxygen-sensor safe"  
    on the label.

    The only problem is that most people don't use a whole lot of
    anti-seize in their lifetime... Anyone who's not a professional
    mechanic and who bought a can of the stuff twenty years ago
    is probably still using it.

    If YOU have a half-full can of twenty-year-old anti-seize, throw
    it out (or mark it "NOT FOR USE ON INTERNAL ENGINE COMPONENTS")
    and buy a can of the new stuff.
