1).  Want to flush the cooling system on my '89 951.  It was easy on
American cars with a kit from prestone but I don't know of a kit for 
the
951.  Can I just add some flush to the reservoir and run it for 30
minutes then drain?  Also, I assume with all the aluminium that you 
must
use a special flush?  When refilling I know that you must use specific
coolant I think Zerex Extreme 450 is one, is there a better one?  My 
car
does not go much past the 3/4 mark but I plan to add water wetter per
the posts here, any feedback???

Why not just fill it with tap water, drive the car for a half hour, 
then drain and fill with antifreeze/distilled water?

2).  The underside of my hood does not have any insulation.  Should a
951 have this?

It was deleted during '87 or '88 by Porsche.

3).  I am thinking about removing the bottom tray under the engine so
that I can drive up to one of these spray washes and clean the bottom 
of
the engine/chassis.  Will this hurt anything?  I think I have several
leaks and the tray is catching the evidence.

No, you'll be fine.

4).  Will any 8 Valve 944 head fit my turbo?  I suspect that I have bad
valve seals and was going to have the head redone but this is a daily
driver.  I was thinking of getting the head & intake manifold set up
from PowerHaus.  They port & polish & shave the head and extrude hone
the intake runners as well as enlarging them.  Any opinions???

Not sure.  I think there was a difference for perhaps the turbo coolant 
circuit, but I do not remember exactly.

5).  Has anyone put a 6 speed transmission from a 968 into a 951???

I believe it is longer and if for no other reason will not fit.  But I 
could be wrong.

Kevin
