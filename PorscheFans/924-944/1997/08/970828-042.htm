 Find yourself a new mechanic...

The reason that your engine is cutting out at 4200 RPM is that the KLR =
is detecting a dangerous situation and
trying to protect your engine from blowing up...

It could  be:

1) Your wastegate is stuck closed, and you are gettting too much boost

2) The KLR is not getting a vacuum reading (quite likely, since your =
boost gauge is, in fact, getting the=20
signal from the KLR).

3) Some other dire problem.


Find yourself a mechanic with the factory service manuals, who can then =
spend the time (and your $$$) to=20
properly diagnose the problem. Also, ask to see the belt tension gauge =
of any prospective 944 or 951 mechanic.
If he doesn't have one, move on to the next likely prospective =
mechanic...

GB=20
