Pfans,

I currently have 215/60/15 Dunlop D40's and they are worn out so I'm replacing
them.  Several people have recommended Yokohama's AVS Intermediates (wet weather
performance is important here), and as it happens they offer the 215's in 50 and
45 profiles.  I asked a local tire shop about using these and they said it would
throw off my computer and all kinds of terrible things would result.  The
computer?  Now, I realize they would throw off the speedo by a couple MPH
(common practice on sportbikes to get stiffer sidewalls while lowering the
center of gravity), but other than that what terrible things could it do?
Anyone using a lower profile tire currently?  The shorter therefor stiffer
sidewalls should help in the handling department and on our sportbikes it
doesn't affect the speedo all that much (couple/few Mph at 60).  The tire dealer
said my only options are 215/60's or 225/60's.  Wouldn't the 225 rub?   If the
225 does fit, then the best option I see would be the 225/50's, and if not then
the 215/45's... no??  If I'm being a complete idiot here, let me know, I just
can't see the downside to lowering the car a couple centimeters and stiffening
the tires a bit.  It won't make the speedo off by all that much will it?  The
computer couldn't care less right?  Any AVS Intermediate complaints?
