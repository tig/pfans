Hey guys,

Not going to believe this, but as I was gettting responses from list
members about whether to install a sunroof or not both Jim Cowan and
Adrien Amaral suggested that I check and see if my 924S was a M030 since
it didn't come with a sunroof.  So they both suggested that I check the
tag behind the spare for an 030 on the options list.  Whooaaa!  Sure
enough it had 030 listed there.  Almost didn't believe it myself.

Thanks to both of guys for saving me from my own ignorance, before I cut
a hole in the roof!  This car isn't meant to have one.  Since I
understand the M030 is kinda of handy to have for autocrossing, guess I
should check into that with my local PCA chapter.  DAMN it's fun to own
a Porsche! ;)
