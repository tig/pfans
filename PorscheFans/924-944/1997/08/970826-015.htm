I had posted a similar problem (944S2 Cold Start) last week,  While a bunch
of new friends responded, and offered many valid tips, I would suggest
retracing any changes made and if none, then read the troubleshooting
signs. Getting good spark, fuel delivery, Only cold start , been sitting,
etc.   The electronics are usually OK, maybe a sensor or something at the
most. But usually it something simple like the plugs.
   
After leaving mine sit for a week, and unhooking my starting relay ( Don't
know if this disables the power to the Control unit) , I returned to
promptly install a new set of correct Bosch's.  While not really
remembering if it had trouble starting it the first time or not, mainly
because it had been sitting, my '90' S2 turned into a hard startin worry.

Dealing with the wife being "stranded" was even worse. Took me 4 times !!!,
 she says.  Don't won't to go there for awhile, thought PMS was bad, try a
'no starting' Worlds Finest automobile, ha !! , that I got rid of a Toyota
for,  Un uh, Speed racer boy !!!  Fix it fast.

Anyway, bottom line I guess, is take a look at the plugs, Fouled,
blackened, anything? Try a new/known good set. Cheap try, you can always
use-em.  It cleared my hard starting right up.   It tried my old ones
first, and It started better than the replacement Bosch's I'd bought first 
Spent 3 days chasing everything.   Fuel, DME, Pressure, Fuel Filter, air
filter( That's a joy to change), temp sensor for cold start, Injector
dirty, battery, etc.. ; it was only the plugs. Starts like before, 3-4
revolutions of the crank and the fires to a steady idle.  The cold
start/car setting for long period is the worst I think because your always
thinking it is something else.

Please drop a line if you need any more info.   S2's  are definitely
different that the 8 valve models.
