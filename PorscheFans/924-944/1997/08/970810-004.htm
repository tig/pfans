Hi Terry

I had a 944S for 2 years (just sold it and bought a 968).  
Unfortunately they are totally gutless below 4000rpm.  although tou 
do eventually get used to this and drive accordingly.  Basically if 
you keep an eye on the revs and always blast it up to around 5200 
then knock it up a gear you always end up back around 4k in the next 
gear.  Lots of ppl like this style of high revs driving.  I quite 
enjoyed it for the most part, but when you fancy a bit of relaxed 
tootling about or when you are trying to nip about in traffic it does 
get a bit tedious.

I am told its all down to early 16V technology.  Apparently a lot of 
VW 16Valvers etc had the same problem at the time.

Stick with it and I'm sure you'll start to enjoy it.  Its still a 
great car, and that rush around 4000 rpm is certainly worth waiting 
for!
