My 87 951 seems to have a little <g> problem.  A year ago I had to replace
the manafold gasket because after firing it up.. I could gently rev it and
could tell it was not "tight" .. like air or compression was "leaking"   so
they fixed it..   now a year later it has the exact same symptoms... but
the same dealer said it wasn't it and adjusted some CO sensor..  

The symptons are simply that when it's first started..  and you rev it
gently, it doesn't seem to run smooth.. "feels" like it's loosing "air"..
then as I go up my apartment's small hill and have to slow for a bump and
get rolling again, it's definately not running right.. seems like it's
puking air compression and barely makes it up the hill.. sure I could gas
it, but I'm not hard on the ding dang thing.  Sometimes taking off from
lights I let the clutch out and feel it a little, but mostly when it's warm
it runs find albeit a little rough.   Any thoughts?...  besides heading
back to the Porsche dealer and wacking them over the head..
