Sorry to take up band width on this list, but this is a worthy
subject to discuss. I was under the assumption that the U.S. 
government was built onder the check and ballance system. Meaning
if one branch of the government got out of control, another branch could =
keep them in line. Well it seems to me ( the un-informed ) that there isn=
't a way to keep the" police under control" ( in the U.S.) The judge is =
also paid out of the same funds that the tickets go into right?

The Police can basically "make up the rules as they go along". ie. I was =
stopped once for "alligedly" speeding.( 80 mph in a 55mph zone) (I was =
NOT speeding, as I was well under the posted limits) When I asked to see =
the reading on the radar unit, the officer refused, and asked if I was =
calling him a lier! He said in Michigan, you don't need to have a radar =
lock on the individuals car, so he didn't have a reading on the radar uni=
t. ( In my opinion the Police should have a digital camera on board, that=
 works with the radar unit, showing a recorded speed history for that ind=
ividuals vehicle) or HARD evidence of speed law violation.We all know Pol=
ice are human, and definately have bad days. They could and sometimes do =
take it out on drivers. What is there to stop them from just picking out =
a car.( Red Porsche ) making up a speeding ticket, without the driver act=
ually being guilty of said offence!

Like the original post I tried to fight the ticket using the legal system=
.. I was told I couldn't request evidence, such as radar unit calibration =
records, officers log book, etc.

I finally gave up, by plea bargaining with the D.A. I would pay the fine,=
 but they would wave the points. Money talks and when you get right to =
it, it isn't a matter of public safety, it is 
just another form of revenue for the police department. That's my two cen=
ts on the matter.
