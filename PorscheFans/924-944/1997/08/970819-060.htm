Yes, the tiptronic may shift faster but unless I'm mistaken, the 911 is
still faster to 60 and the 1/4 mile with a standard according to factory
figures.  My guess for this discrepancy is that despite the quick shifts,
even the tiptronic is still based on the same old bands/drum/planetary gear
technology, unlike the F1 transmissions you mention (they use a real
clutch).  The pumping of transmission oil, etc. contribute to loss of
efficiency (power to the rear wheels).  Incidentally, the
bands/drum/planetary gear transmission dates back to the Ford Model T of
1909 (no kidding).  The basic differences between it and an automatic is
that instead of floor mounted pedals to actuate the bands, an automatic
does it with hydraulic power and a 'hydraulically programmed' valve body
while 'modern' automatics utilize a computer to tell the hydraulics when to
apply those bands.  Also, the hydraulic torque converter allows the car to
sit still without shifting to neutral (as was required in the Model T). 
And modern automatics all have lock up torque converters now, in the quest
for better highway mileage (I assume this is why top speeds are little
changed).  In the case of the tiptronic, you tell the computer when to
shift with the paddle.  This is certainly an improvement over a
conventional automatic but is it not still a compromise in the fun dept.? 
(I admit I have never driven one - any comments from someone who has had
the opportunity to compare back-to-back?)

The 931 should be able to cruise at 100mph (approx 3.3K rpm on my dial) 
this is not excessive on the Germany autobarns.
     
     
        Heck, I've run my John Deere right though my autobarn at over 35 mph.  
        But is sure stirred up the chickens and ol' Bessie!
