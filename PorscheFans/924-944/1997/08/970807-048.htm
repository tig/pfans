Regarding the front spoiler: get copies of Excellence, European Car,
Panorama 
etc. and call the recyclers who advertise there. I recently bought a used 
spoiler in excellent condition from NPR (Nebraska parts recyclers, 800 279 
5183) for something like $300. Of course you would need to paint it

I had just returned from a road trip to NPR to pick up some parts when I
checked the site and found this message.  What a kick.  If you have never
been to the place you would be amazed.  It is hidden away (and I mean
hidden) near a little town 6,900 population called Blair Nebraska just
across the Iowa - Nebraska border.  Basicly what you will find is a farm
house surrounded by P-cars in various stages of demolition.   Almost all
water cooled models although I did come across one burned out 911 and a few
914's.  The guy who owns the place (and from what I can see is the only
employee) is unique.  Middle aged hippie type who can talk to you all day
and you like it.  Knows his stuff when it comes to Porsches.  He has
rebuilt many Porsches himself and can and will give lots of free advice on
rebuilding jobs.  If you ever get the chance, stop in if for nothing else
but the experience.
