Hello P-fans:
	I will start updating the statis on the race car we are currently
building.  One is a 87 Turbo, and other is a 88 Turbo-S.  The 87 turbo

interior was completely taken out:

--All sound deadening and carpet (53.5 lbs)
--All A/C units, evp, condenser, hoses (67lbs)
--hood (53 lbs)
--rear hatch (43lbs)
--rear bumper (23lbs)
--headlight assembly (12lbs)
--windshelg wiper fluid res. (2lbs)
--stereo, amplifers, speakers, harness (17lbs)
--Fog lights and turning signals (7lbs)
--factory leather seat driver pwr (55lbs)  Passenger (46lbs) rear seats
(37lbs)
--installed racetec rollcage 97lbs with door bars
