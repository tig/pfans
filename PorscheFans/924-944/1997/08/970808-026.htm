I have a similar problem, my AC doesn't work but I don't
know where the problem is located.  I am going to attempt to
fix it myself.  I have changed the water pump on my car
but this repair is probably going to be more difficult 
than that. 

I need to get a vaccum pump to remove all of the excess air 
and moisture from the system once it's opened up, and probably
a leak detector.  The leak detector shouldn't be hard to get,
but I think the pump will be harder to get at a reasonable
price.  I hope I can rent one, otherwise I'll have the shop
do it, or maybe I'll try the "propane tank surrounded with 
dry ice" method.

I also need to figure out if I need to flush the system if the 
compressor is blown, whether or not to add any oil, how much,
and how to do it.  Before I can do anything, the shop needs to 
evacuate whatever R-12 is left in the system because I hear the
equipment to do this is specialized.

You can get the R-12 pretty easily once you have the license.
I just stopped into my local Autozone and picked up a few
cans of Freon for around $18 a can after I showed them my
license.  The license is very easy to get. 

I hate going to shops; this is why I put myself through this 
ordeal.
