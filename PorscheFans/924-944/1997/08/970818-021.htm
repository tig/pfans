Well, Pfans, it is time for me to ask for help.  This weekend Chicagoland
had a tremendous amount of rain.  I had left my '88 Turbo S at work in our
depressed loading dock (and now, I'm extremely depressed, too).  The car
was parked facing uphill at the lowest part of the dock, and the drains in
the dock backed up due to extreme flooding in the area.  From what I am
told, the water was up to the windows of the car.  The car was locked and
the windows were up all the way.  The alarm had not been set by me, but was
apparently activated by the water, and then probably shorted out.  I don't
know what else has been damaged electrically, and I'm not about to try to
start it until everything has had a chance to dry out thoroughly.  Right
now, I have emptied out the vehicle of all personal items, floor mats,
spare tire, jack, etc., and have the doors and hoods open and a fan
circulating air.  Needless to say, all of the carpeting and upholstery is
soaked through.  I will be calling my insurance company (State Farm) later
this morning to find out what my policy might cover, but in the meantime, I
would like to enlist the aid of this fine group in offering any and all
suggestions as to what steps I should take to prevent any additional damage
(engine, interior, undercarriage, whatever).  I seem to recall someone
having similar experiences last fall/winter with a flooded viaduct.
TIA for any help you can offer.
