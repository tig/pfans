I recovered my 3-spoke wheel with a kit from Alan Gunn's Leatther
Accessories (bought from Type 911 in the UK). It took some time and
patience, but the result was perfect. As long as you know how to lace a


shoe, sowing the steering sheel shouldn't be much of a problem.

Some things to remember though - wrap a towel around the bottom of the
steering wheel. You would want to sit comfortably with the wheel in your
lap, without worrying that you'll make a mess. Also, the first ten stitches
are the worst, so don't give up. After a couple of retries you should get
the hang of it. I used 4 hours on the first stitches, and as much on the
rest of the wheel. Be sure to tighten everything evenly. Wear sunscreen.
