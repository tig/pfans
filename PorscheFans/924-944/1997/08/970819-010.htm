Bruce,

Your 931 wastegate set-up is definitely not a factory design.  I would guess
that a previous owner may have been trying to remedy a wastegate problem by
installing the sprung ball valve on the wastegate control pressure line.
Maybe it's a re-design of the whole system.  I have owned a 1980 931 since
1987, and I've had to install a new valve guide, spring and bellows to the
wastegate to keep her in shape.  It's not common knowledge that this re-build
can be done.  The dealers will tell you to install a $1700 replacement unit.
Thus, the previous owner may have tried to remedy things from the outside.

IMHO, if the old set-up works you should stick with it.  Then tell us all
how it works.  For the ball valve to regulate pressure to the wastegate it
would require at least a little air flow thru the line unless the ball valve
makes a perfect seal.  If it made a perfect seal, then the wastegate bellows
could not deflate and close the wastegate valve once it had opened.  My guess
is the ball valve increases the pressure at which the wastegate opens, and 
this pressure increase is a function of the amount of air flowing thru the
control line.  A factory set-up has a sealed bellows and no net air flows
thru the control line.  Too much air lost thru the control line would result
in an over-rich fuel mixture as the air meter is in front of the control line
branch from the pressure duct.  It also cuts the power gain from turbocharging.
Without seeing the wastegate internals and their condition, it's pretty much 
a guessing game figuring out what's going on.

Can you contact the previous owner(s) for any hints as to what was done to
the wastegate system?
