Hey ya'll,

With all this technical info on the 951 wastegate being distributed, I =
had a question. Are there any differences between the 951 and 951S (and =
'89 951) versions of the wastegate?  For instance, is the spring tension =
more for the 951S to allow for greater boost?

As a side issue, are the chipsets like the Weltmeister(Dinan) brand =
which use a shim on the wastegate a better way to increase 951 boost and =
performance than the other chip upgrades?  I know one of the cons is =
additional installation labor, but is this a better modification?

And lastly, I feel the new 996 looks great in pictures and will look =
even better in 3D.  All the pictures of the Boxster looked disappointing =
to me, but seeing a real one makes the difference.  The 944 series is a =
typical example.  They look *sooooooo* much better in real life than in =
pictures.  =20

It can go the other way though.  The new Corvette looks worse to me in =
person than in pictures. I was really excited to finally see one and =
when I did, I personnally came away unimpressed. (The tail of it looks =
like a design afterthought).  Hey, it's a 928/944/968 wannabe anyway.  =
As Fernando Lamas sez - "It's better to look good than feel good!"  You =
gotta look good in the pictures.

If it ain't turbocharged, I don't want it.

Happy Motoring,

J. Dean Roberson
'87 951 - Shimmed wastegate - it's tight and that's alright!
