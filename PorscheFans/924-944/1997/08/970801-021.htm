Angel,

I do in fact have the artistry and experience to write HTML, and have skydiving,
sportbike, and yes Porsche pages that are taking hits every day.  Not all of us
ugly prejudice guys are stupid.  I've discussed this issue with a few of the
list members over the last couple days, and I'll share that with you.

I should not have posted the warning about what you intended to do with the pics
in a humorous way.  At the time I and several others found it funny, however it
wasn't appropriate.  I'm sure you've seen at least one of the apologies I've
posted for offending anyone and I think that should be enough.  I am, however,
not the only one at fault here.  You should know and fully realize that just
because you are comfortable with your lifestyle, and because you have every
right to it, does not mean that all of us are comfortable with being involved or
associated with that.  You were not upfront, and several people have thanked me
for warning them just before they sent you their pics.  I have nothing against
skin heads, but that doesn't mean I want my pics on their pages either.  What
I'm trying to say, and probably not doing a good job of, is if you intend to put
people's pictures in a place they may find offensive, then you should inform
them to look before they leap.  Perhaps telling them to check out your web page,
and if they'd like to have a picture displayed there then please email one.
That would have been more appropriate.  Your email address and name, lead many
of us to believe it was a female asking for our pics.  I informed the list
otherwise, in a humorous way, that you didn't find humorous.  Sorry again.  Now
can we leave sexual preferences and bandwidth alone and get back to Porsche's?
I don't care what your preferences are, this is only a mailing list...not a
date.

Bill
