To all those folks out there who responded both quickly and positively =
to my inquiry about providing Porsche Wallpaper for your Win95 =
systems... I thank you.

As you know, I was delighted to see an enormous number of request and =
replies. I have tried to respond and send along an example of my designs =
to all. If I left anyone out I apologize... please let me know and I =
will send again.

My one request is that if you would like to get some of the P-car =
wallpapers for your office, please specify in what format you would like =
to receive them ie. .bmp .jpeg .gif. etc. As you are all probably aware, =
the wallpaper if sent in anything else other then .bmp needs to be =
converted to such to work.

All the best and safe trippin'
