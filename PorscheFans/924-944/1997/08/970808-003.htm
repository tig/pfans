I can confirm this, I had a set of 245/45ZR16's on the back of my 951 and 
although thay are cheap (relatively speaking) they only lasted 12K and they 
were also much noisier than my current Falken tyres (also relatively cheap). 


As to ascertain whether it is cheaper in the long run to buy name-brand 
tyres such as Pirelli, Goodyear, Bridgestone, etc. what sort of mileage do 
people get out of these ( particularly the rear's of a 951) ?

Thanks
