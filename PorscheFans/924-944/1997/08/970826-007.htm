That question brings up a  point I've been thinking about.  In a friend's 5.0
mustang we installed a short pulley set.  What these do is underdrive the
powersteering, alternator or whatever so that they are not spinning as much,
hence not removing as much power from the system.  This sounds kinda silly, and
that's why I chose to help him with it.  Believe it or not, it helped noticeably
in the horsepower department, and couldn't feel any power steering difference.
Which, of course, makes me wonder about doing the same to the P-car.  Yes,
before all the doubters jump me, I do realize it reduces your charging at idle
to nill, but I don't idle around town much.  I don't know that I'd do this to my
Porsche as it was never really intended as my hooligan horsepower machine, but
it's an idea that I wonder about.  Chances are the Porsche designed their system
closer to the correct way than the Ford engineers did.
