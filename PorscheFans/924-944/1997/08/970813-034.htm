I was just curious as to if anyone else has problems with their rear hatch
unlocking with the release switch.  I was having problems with my releasing
all the way.  I just now replaced my rear hatch shocks and now the hatch
opens up all the way.. although not only does it open up, it could lift up
about 20lbs along with it.  I was wondering if maybe I got aftermarket
shocks that are too stiff for my rear hatch or is this how the hatch is
suppose to work.  With these new shocks it's not easy to shut the rear
hatch.. It takes a good 40ft lbs to close and two hands. 


						Thanks, Brent
