Hi all,
I have a late '85 944.  I recently had an alarm installed and a minor
disaster occurred.  The installers removed the cap from the ignition
wiring cradle attached to the end of the ignition switch.  Along with
the cap came all six wires.  Unfortunately, they had no idea how to
rewire a Porsche ignition.  They got it running again, but the Accessory
position didn't work (radio, sun-roof removal, etc...)  Using a Hayes
manual I rewired it to be mostly correct, but there is a wire or two
that I'm not one-hundred percent confident about.  Has anyone out there
done this or know which wires go where?  I'm confident I have 4 of the
six correct, but I want to make absolutely sure the other two are
correct also (and I don't want to pay the dealer $100 to do it).

If someone is interested in working with me on this let me know.

thanks!
