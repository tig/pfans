OK, so its a bad thing to speed, and so I'm guilty sometimes.  I'll accept
that.  But When in Florida and a speeding ticket can run $400 and insurance
rates double because of it, you're damn right I'm going to whine.  Now, to be
clear, it hasn't happened to me in years (thanks Passport).  But I think the
penalties can be pretty silly and cost you thousands over the three years it
takes to get those points off your insurance bills.  So if it happens to
me...I'm going to whine.  Just expect it.  I'll write in one day complaining
about how the jerk pulled my red porsche out of the crowd because he's a facist,
donut eating, pencil neck that was picked on to much as a kid, and not old
enough to drink yet.  And if I have to put out that kind of money because our
country changes speed limits on a whim based more on economics than safety, then
I'm sure the pencil neck's ego won't be hurt to much.  By the way, the new 70mph
speed limits here make it fairly easy to stay out of trouble.

Bill
