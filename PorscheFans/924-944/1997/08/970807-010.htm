Speedline of Italy was responsible for the C2 turbo wheels. Speedline
seem to be the OEM for Porsche wheels at the moment. They may not be
responsible for some of the rarer wheels such as the magnesium euro RS
and turbo hollow spoke items.

Hi P-fans,
	I have a question regarding which wheel manufacturer(s) are responsible
for the 17" factory C2 turbo and 993 Cup Turbo one-piece rims?  I know
that Fuchs and Mahle have both manufactured factory rims for Porsche in
the past, but I don't know about now.  The reason I'm asking is because
with all the Porsche "replica" rims out there made by many different
companies, whose left to make the "real" rims?

Mahalo in Advance,

Alex
