I have just heard from a Porsche franchise garage that the part I =
ordered on April 8  (1 metre of cloth to repair a worn drivers seat) - =
is no longer available, and that " Porsche, Germany have changed =
suppliers and the fabric will not be available any more".

Has anyone else had to try and get fabric?  Is a change to leather the =
only
alternative?  I only need to replace a bit (a few inches square) the =
right hand side bolster (the bit that fits behind ones right shoulder).  =
What are the options? The bit I am after is a very light beige, almost =
cream with a very feint blue grey cheque.  The part number is apparently =
PTPD.000.000.00 6U cloth.

If anyone has any "bits" please let me know!  It looks like we are all =
going
to have to go to learn to use seat covers..oh no!
