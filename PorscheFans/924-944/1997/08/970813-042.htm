I have decided to preface all of my lengthy, if not questionable, 
ramblings with the title of "Rev Limiter".  For all of you E-mail pros, 
if you find these blathering too much to digest, you can easily set your 
"filters" to quickly parse my thoughts and opinions from your in boxes.

Over the last few weeks I have seen a number of potential first time 
buyers for the 944 series asking questions.  There is already a great FAQ 
from a fellow list member that, in pain staking detail, expounds on all 
of the do's and don'ts of first time Porsche buying.  In that light, I 
have decided to add my twist and take you through a little 944 history 
lesson with a dash of economics just for good measure.

I may further add that all 944s can trace their nobel roots to the 924 
and 928 models.  I apologize to all of those 924 and 928 owners for not 
detailing the chronological history of those cars, but I am ignorant of 
them and can not do them justice, although, I am sure that I will now 
soon get my own history lesson with a rash of E-mail responses.

Buying A 944

Let's start with the pecking order for cost per mile, not including 
purchase price, starting with the cheapest to the most expensive.  
Ratings for this would loosely start with the normally aspirated 944, 
then the 944S2, closely followed by the 944S, and last and least is the 
fabled Turbo.  The 968, in my mind, should be at the top of this list for 
low maintenance, but there are too few examples, and most have very low 
relative mileage, to make an accurate assessment on operational costs 
given its short history.  Oh, this does not include insurance, but that 
would only exaggerate the pecking order.

Which model to buy?  That depends on what your goals are and your 
financial resources.  General rule of thumb is to buy the newest car you 
can afford and still have cash ready for the repairs that will surprise 
you, and they will.  The later year cars have been through the process of 
refinement with the 968 sitting at the top of the heap.

The Normally Aspirated 944 (1983 through 1989)

First is the humble 944.  Although the lowest on the horse power list, it 
is still a formable car.  The maintenance will be the lowest for these 
models and there are plenty to chose from making the task of finding an 
example in proper working order comparatively easy.  The last year for 
the 944 was 1989. 1988 and 1989 saw a slight increase in engine 
displacement (up from 2.5 liters to 2.7) which improved the power output 
from about 150 horses to nearly 165.  Other improvements were optional 
ABS and possibly air bags.  Of all of the normally aspirated 944 cars 
made from 1983 through 1989, the midyear 1985 through 1989 models offered 
a much improved version over the predecessors.  The dash, ventilation, 
and drive line were all improved making this model one of the best 
Porsche values.  All of those attributes make the 944 the entry car of 
choice for most people.  Many owners choose later to migrate to either 
one of the Turbos, 944S2, or the 968.  Performance improvements are 
fairly limited.  Prices start at about $3,500 and top out around the 
$10,000 range.

The 944S (1987 through 1988)

The 944S was the 2.5 liter predecessor of the later 16 valve 944S2.  The 
front nose of the 944S resembles the normally aspirated car, where as the 
S2 looks like the Turbo.  In 1987, Porsche produced a special model with 
the S insignia.  The S designation was always reserved for models that 
embraced sporty driving.  In many ways the 944S had a lot in common with 
its 1967 911S cousin.  The performance is almost identical in 
acceleration and top speed between the two models.  It has aptly earned 
its special designation, but has still received a lot of criticism.  
Perhaps this is a sign of character, but there were some real complaints 
when Porsche's asking price for the 1988 model when it hit $45,000 with 
all the extra trimmings (ABS and air bags as well)!  As with all things 
controversial, the 944S has received more mixed reviews due to its rather 
modest horse power output gain (188 hp) over the 944 (148 hp), and 
relative lack of lower end torque below 3,500 rpm, which the S2 models 
had rectified by 1989.  The 944S enjoyed only two years of production 
from 1987 through 1988.  Still, the 944S is a good car, but must be 
driven a 9/10ths and above to make it work for you.  Some people really 
like this about the car, and I too, can attest that, although a good bit 
slower than the 944S2 or Turbo, it rates very high on the fun scale.  The 
car begs to be driven above 4,000 rpm and rewards the driver well for 
their indulgence.  On the flip side, this will accelerate wear and tear.  
The 16 valve head will also increase maintenance costs and is 
particularly vulnerable to timing belt failure.  All of the 944 series 
have an interference fit between the valves and the pistons.  Should the 
timing belt fail, the valves will be sent crashing into the pistons and 
the resulting damage can be expensive for all of the 8 valve cars, and 
down right catastrophic for the 16 valve cars.  Only about 13,000 944S 
cars were shipped to the US shores in 1987 and 1988, with most being 1988 
vintage.  Despite its somewhat rarity, it has not commanded a premium 
resale price that other Porsches models endowed with the S symbol have 
enjoyed.  Prices are slightly higher than the normally aspirated cars 
starting at about $7,000 and going as high as about $10,000.

The 944 S2 (1989 through 1991)

From 1989 through the 1991 years the 944S2 had its run.  This was a 3.0 
liter, 207 horse power, normally aspirated car.  The appearance of the S2 
looked just like the Turbo and had the same suspension and brakes as 
well.  It was also the first 944 to be available as a cabrio.  The 944S2 
is a popular track car with its low end torque.  The drivability of this 
car is exceptional and is just as happy to be wallowing along in heavy 
traffic as it is on an empty twisty road.  This car is also well coveted 
and can be had for as low as $10,000 and up, or about half the cost of 
the 968.  I am not sure about the actual production numbers for this car, 
but there seems to be many more than its 16 valve predecessor, the 944S.

The Turbos (1986 through 1991)

1990 was the last year for the Turbo which started with the 1986 year, 
but only 100 models were imported into the USA 1990.  The 1986 
introduction model was, and still is, a great car.  1987 brought some 
major improvements with optional ABS and air bags.  By 1988 air bags were 
pretty much defacto standard.  All of the model years for the turbo were 
excellent versions.  They came with 217 horse power and much improved 
brakes.   The crowning achievement for the Turbo charged cars was from 
the last half of 1988 through 1990.  This is the renown Turbo S with all 
the goodies.  It is the most sought after 944 and with good reason.  
Everything that was right with the previous model Turbos was enhanced.  
These S models were actually street versions of the famous Porsche Turbo 
Cup cars.  The S had better brakes, more power (247 hp), M030 adjustable 
sport suspension, and a host of other tweaks that made it one of the best 
Porsche cars available.  In 1989 the 944 Turbo was the fastest car 
Porsche produced, out pacing the 928 and 911 variants in both 
acceleration and top end speed!  Only about 2,200 of the Turbo S cars 
were exported to the USA from 1988 through 1990.  In 1990 there was even 
a cabrio version in limited numbers, although I am not sure if any were 
really imported as true US models.  These cars are also the most likely 
to absorb your hard earned green backs.  They have been known to suck 
them right through the skin of your wallet.  If the cost of repairs does 
not deflate your resolve, hold on!  The Turbo series offers the greatest 
opportunity to pour money into you car for no other reason but speed 
advancement.  No other 944 model has so much potential for performance 
improvements.  These cars are readily modifiable to produce 300 horse 
power and beyond.  It is best to find an unmolested car if your desire is 
to use it for street driving, but many people have added third party 
computer chips that can relatively safely add power without sacrificing 
reliability.  Be careful when choosing the Turbo.  The right car can be 
an awesome partnership, but the wrong one will be your worst nightmare.  
Prices for Turbos start at about $8,000 for a base 1986 model and go up 
to the +$20,000 range for the rarer variations.  All years for the Turbo 
were excellent models, but the 1986 model had a few differences with the 
suspension that requires different offset wheels than post 1986 cars.  
Still, the 1986 model is an outstanding buy and does not suffer from any 
of the typical first model year blues that so many manufactures seem to 
have.

The 968 (1992 through 1995 the final years)

The 968 saw production from 1992 through 1995.  It replaced all 944 
models, including the venerable Turbos which many felt were encroaching 
on the sacred toes of the 911 series.  This was a turbulent time for 
Porsche and sales were still on a downward spiral from the late 1980s.  
Sports cars all over the world were losing their appeal to the sport 
utility vehicle, and Porsche introduced their total model redesign in the 
midst of this turmoil.  Production numbers were low as the price for 
these cars had escalated upward with each year.  On the positive side was 
the amount of engineering that had been put into this model.  Although 
many things were similar to the 944, many other things were redesigned.  
Exterior appointments took on the appearance of the 928.  At the heart of 
that redesign was the engine.  Advances in design for the 968 were 
directly responsible for the Boxster engine.  Porsche took the 3.0 liter 
944S2 engine and increased the horse power from 207 to 236.  With the 
invention of the VarioCam, which adjusted the relative timing of the 
intake and exhaust valves, Porsche was able to dramatically increase the 
low end torque beyond the already hefty 944S2.  The result was a much 
faster car.  So much so, that it was almost able to eclipse the Turbo in 
strait line speed.  In tight turns, the 968 was far easier to drive fast, 
making this normally aspirated car slightly quicker with its balanced six 
speed transmission.  The 968 was also the first front engine Porsche to 
offer the Tiptronic transmission which is a cross between an automatic 
transmission and a clutch less manual transmission.  Prices for these 
cars start at about $20,000.  Production of the 968 was halted in 1995 
with a change in direction and internal leadership.  It was Porsches 
decision to return to its roots of rear and mid engine cars and thus was 
born the Boxster in 1997 with its secret links to the water cooled front 
engine 968 that Porsche had orphaned.

Where To Go From Here

Any model that you seriously consider for ownership must be thoroughly 
examined by a dealer or Porsche specialist.  Remember to have some cash 
reserves on hand or you will find your dreams turning into financial 
nightmares.  Drive as many cars as you can.  The more seat time you have, 
the better your understanding for these cars will be.

Another tip for examining the fit and finish for any car is to hand wash 
it.  This is the best way to be intimate with every nick and scratch.
