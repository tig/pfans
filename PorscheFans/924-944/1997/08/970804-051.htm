BMW has always done an outstanding job with there cars.  The M series is
truly a great machine.  After driving both I just prefer a sports car to a
sports sedan.  Besides, my 89 Turbo gets better gas mileage.

>Hansman,

>The E30 M3 is a purpose built race car.  It was only sold to the public for
>homolgation.  It is also the winningest car in touring class racing EVER.
>It is a VERY solid chassis, and is a killer at the track.  Now, the 951 has
>more power and does accelerate more quickly, but that is only part of the
>picture.
>
>For example, we all know a 930 is a fast car, right?  The owner of our
>company owns a '89 962, '89 930, Datsun 510, and a minivan (eek!).  One
>weekend he had both the 510 and the 930 at Laguna Seca.  The 510 is
>prepared for SCCA ITC and the 930 is basicly stock (it had race Yokos) and
>he drove both on the track.  The 510 had 8 second (yes 8, not a mis-print)
>faster lap times.  Now this proves little, but it is a good analogy.
>Despite the fact that the 930 is a MUCH faster car, the 510 killed it in
>the corners.  IF the 930 was race-preped it would win (by alot), but that
>is another story.  My point is, the E30 M3 is a very, VERY good track car,
>and can beat *most* cars including a 951 despite having less power. Not
>that a 951 couldn't win, but the M3 would certainly not be "blown-away"
>unless the driver was a newbie.
>
>People like Gary Bossert are being VERY successful racing this aging car
>from the mid-'80s.  Now the 951 is also a very nice car, and a much better
>daily driver.  It isn't buzzy, lacks the rough stock suspension on the E30
>etc.  But the E30 (as stated in the previous post) can easily match a 951
>on the track.
>
>Now, I own an E30 M3, and plan on getting a 951 in the near future for
>track driving.  This may seem strange after what I have written, but I have
>chosen the 951 over the E30 M3 for several reasons.  First, it cost less to
>begin with.  Second, parts costs.  My reasoning- while BMW parts are
>usually inexpensive (in comparison to Porsche), with less than 5000 E30 M3s
>ever being produced, parts are VERY hard to come by (therefore expensive).
>Very few parts on the E30 M3 are on the E30 325 or other cars.  Third, I'd
>like to race a Porsche. My reasoning- PCA club racing is a fairly good
>series, and far less expensive than SCCA or NASA.
>
>So, hopefully I will get a 951 in the next few weeks.  I've just got to
>sell my '67 Firebird first (anybody want a cherry '67 Firebird 400?) I will
>defend the E30 M3 to my grave, because I know it is a VERY solid car (Plus,
>its history speaks for its self) but I cannot afford to race one.
>
>BTW, other BMWs to watch out for:
>M1
>M5
>E36 M3 (and lightweight)
>Dinan Supercharged or Turbo cars
>Alpina Cars
>ERT Supercharged E30 or E36 M3
>probably more but that is all I can think of...
