Hey I don't want to get self righteous about this, I speed ALL the 
time, but comments such as....

When I speed I do so only if I consider it safe to do so.
If I wipe myself out because I was going to fast on an empty road and
I couldn't handle my car then it's my fault and I only endangered
myself...

.....always amuse me.  I have used this argument myself, but I 
always have this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that this is 
a teeny bit lame.  How can you REALLY assess the safety of the road 
ahaead travelling at a high speed.  Most other drivers (in the UK at 
least) don't expect many cars to be flying around at the speeds that 
our cars are capable of, so its likely that on motorways (freeways if 
you like) some slightly dozy individual is going to wander out into 
the fast lane in front of you just because they don't bother to 
assess how fast you are approaching them.  This is not really their 
fault.

Even on a perfectly clear road, the sort of distances you can cover 
in a matter of seconds mean that you can never be absolutely sure 
that it is safe that far ahead.  I am sure that some of the desert 
roads in the US are an exception to this but even then there are 
problems.

What about the next poor soul doing the same thing who piles into 
the stack of scrap that used to be you in you car.  Also in other 
circumsatnces there are risks to the rescue and fire services who may 
be called out to cut you out of a burning car or one in a precarious 
position.  Then (in this country at least) there is the burden on 
medical resources to patch you up after the smash.  Possible damage 
to public property that you may have hit etc etc.

A serious accident is very rarely just something that affects just 
yourself.

Having said all that I agree that speed limits are a pain and I wish 
we all had derestricted autobahns.  At least on these roads high 
speeds are the norm and people are ready to get out of the way.  I 
belive that the accident rate on these roads is much lower as well.  
However the road surfaces are much better.  This may be another 
reason for the imposition of speed limits in other areas.

We all take a number of risks when we speed, not just with our own 
skins but with other licences etc.  I think we just have to accept 
this a s a fact of life.  Along with the fact that if you have a 
Porsche you NEVER get the benefit of the doubt, sad but true. 

Anyway thats my sermon for the day, I'll probably get a ticket this 
afternoon just to put me in my place :)
