Sounds like the ball joint, and it sounds like it is bad.

MY car (89 Turbo) had the same problem.  Your control arms have a harder 
durometer bushing (part of the M030 suspension option) that is not 
available as a individual part.  

However, you can get the ball joint fixed and this is how I did mine.

I replaced both joints as I figured that they both had the same number of 
miles...   First, mark the position of the rear A-arm mount with a 
scribe.  You need this to insure you get the A-arm back to its original 
alignment position.

Next, remove the A-arms (I recommend doing both) by removing all the 
bolts on all three corners.  There will be four bolts altogether.  With a 
rubber mallet, tap the A-arm (outside end of the A-arm) down from the top 
side to free the ball joint.

I sent my A-arms to Dynamic European Technologies (713 661-2780) and they 
replaced the ball joints in my original arms for $149.00 each with a 
three year warranty.  I have heard nothing but good responses from 
everyone I have talked to that uses his service.

Reassembly is the reverse of removal.  I used a jack to slowly push the 
ball joint stem back into spindle, but be careful not to push it too far 
and damage the rubber ball joint boot.

Pull the rear A-arm mount until it matches the marks scribed into the 
chassis you made earlier and tighten to specified torque.  I used some 
clamps to help align the rear mount before tightening.

The job is easy, budget about four hours from start to finish for the 
first timer.

Good luck,

Marv
