Thanks to Jeff Mayzurk <jeffm@eonline.com> for the copy of his PCA
Evaluation form.  Just talked to the service mgr at Napleton Porsche.  The
State Farm adjuster was out to look at the Turbo S last night, took about
20 pictures, and promptly put a "Salvage" sticker on the car, although he
isn't the one to make the "final" decision as to whether or not the car is
"totalled", but chances are, that will be the case.  Now, if things go
decently for me, I might have a chance to buy the car back with a salvage
title for a relatively cheap price after whatever settlement I make with
them.  If that is the case, I will probably part out the mechanicals.  The
service manager did turn over the engine (without starting it) - there was
no hydro-lock and no water came out of the exhaust, so he is pretty sure
there was no mechanical engine damage.  Now, its just a "wait and see"
situation with the insurance company.

Thanks for your support
