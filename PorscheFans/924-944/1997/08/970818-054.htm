Okay, I've had this no start problem for a little while and it is starting
to get really old..Sometimes my 86 951 will crank over perfectly but will
not catch.  If this happens I have to pop the hood and shake these two
wires. After doing this it starts every time, however it is annoying.  I'm
not sure what the wires go to and what they are called. They are located
behind the intake runners along the fire wall. There is a square mount for
them attached to the intake.  One is above the other.  They have a square
connector.  I have taken them apart and cleaned the connections several
times. It usually happens 1/15 starts.  If anyone has any suggestions I
would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
-Paul
