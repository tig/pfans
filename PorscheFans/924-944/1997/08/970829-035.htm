When I started up the engine on my '88 944 N/A, the warning light and the=

'Oil Pressure' light stayed on for no apparent reason.  I had oil (dip
stick) and oil pressure (oil pressure gage).  I turned the engine off and=

back on, lights still on.  Drove, parked the car, started it, lights off.=

Does anybody have an idea what's going on?

You have the oil demon in your engine.  Light a dried bough of holly and
dance around your car screaming, "Out demon, begone".

Envision this, the factory engineers design the 944 engine listing to the=

left side.  The Porsche owner  races the car and pulls high G's in right
hand sweepers.  The oil pickup is uncovered and sucks air.  The good old =
#2
rod bearing spins and grenades the engine.  The factory can do one of two=

things.  Either give the engineers a bonus for increasing the engine
rebuild business or install  the low oil sensor higher in the pan.

You had oil but not enough to make the oil level sensor happy.  After you=

parked, the oil in the block drained down, the level rose and the light
went out.  Keep your oil level at the full mark or 1/8" above and the oil=

light troll will stay under the bridge.
