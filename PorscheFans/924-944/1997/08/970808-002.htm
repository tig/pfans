All the posts about noisy belts got me thinking I should check mine, as
it was sounding a bit like a jet turbine at low revs, unfortunately I
didn't get that far. 
On the way home from work last night the motor just stopped, I tried
starting it but it was just turning over caught once or twice but was
lumpier than my gravy, then whilst turning over it just stopped dead,
tried again and it turned over easily again. looking back this was
probably the stupidest thing I could have done.
Anyway I opened the Bonnet (Hood) to check it out and after a bit of
investigation found the cam belt had no teeth left, checked the timing
and it was advanced by about 8 teeth, what are my chances of having got
away with this, I reckon none. I will be fitting a belt and doing a
compression test before I strip anything, but I'm thinking I will have
to at least pull the head off, are there any special
precautions/procedures for doing this or is it as straight forward as it
looks.
The moral for 924 owners, the guide for tensioning the belt says turn
the loose part of the belt 90 degrees, I could turn it ok, but the
recovery man could only manage 45, guess the people who wrote haynes had
upper body strength less than mine .....
