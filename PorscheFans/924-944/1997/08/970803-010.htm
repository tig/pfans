Glenn, it sounds like what you are describing is your rear swaybar. The
968CS's rear swaybar should have the three adjustment holes you mentioned.
To adjust the sway bar to a softer position, jack up the rear of the car so
that both rear wheels are off the ground. Support it with jack stands and
move the swaybar drop link to the hole nearest the end of the swaybar.
Reattach all hardware and lower the car to the ground. This adjustment will
lessen the oversteer you are encountering.
