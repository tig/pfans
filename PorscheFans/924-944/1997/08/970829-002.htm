Pfans, I've got a few questions.

First off, I would just like to say that I enjoy reading through the list
every day.  It's fun to see that most people here write with a sense of
humor.

So, first question.  Lately my '86 951 has been having trouble starting. 
I'll turn the key, and it will start to turn over, then just stop.  I can
usually get the car to start on the second time; although sometimes the 3rd
time.  I haven't noticed any leaks under the car, so I don't think it's the
fuel pump (or fuel filter)

Next, the metal strip that runs along the top of the hatchback is somewhat
warped (or bent) and when it rains (or I wash the car) I get water running
down the inside of the hatchback window.  I know this metal strip is the
problem or at least part of the problem because I can see between it's edge
and the edge of the glass down to the rubber seal..  This is not good
because I have my subwoofer box with the amplifier right there behind the
back seat.  I think the metal stripping is part number 477.853.313A (Upper
hatch trim).  Every illustration that I see shows this part bigger than it
actually is.  Maybe I'm missing something from mine?  Anyway, I want to
stop the leaking.  I went to an auto glass shop, and they fed me some line
about the hatchback being a complete unit (spoiler, and all); yeah right,
as if!

I would also like to replace the dashboard because of cracking, any
inexpensive thoughts?

I've got AutoAtlanta and Automotion catalogs, are there any other that are
recommended?

Does anyone know of any good Porsche dismantling locations in the midwest?
(Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, North/South Dakota, Nebraska)

TIA
Jeff

'86 951 black/black
and maybe '86 951 guards red/tan (if my brother-in-law can't afford to fix
it)
