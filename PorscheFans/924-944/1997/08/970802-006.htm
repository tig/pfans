Remember that 8 hour wax job I did on my car in the Spring? Keep that in
mind while reading this. I'm traveling down Hwy 6 in Texas about halfway
between Waco and College Station, i.e. in the middle of no where. It's a
two lane blacktop with a speed limit of 70. I'm doing about 85 when I come
up behind a semi doing about 75. I hang back til things are clear then I
move to pass him on a straight. I get up to his cab (doing about 90 at
this point) when I suddenly I hear an extremely loud, "THWAP, THWAP,
THWAP,THWAP" sound coming from my car. Well, I freak. I hit the brakes and
pull back into my lane, pull to the side and shut it down. I'm thinking
it's a tire but then realize if it was tire, I'd be dead already. I get
out and start looking around. Can't find anything. Check the tires.
Nothing. I go to get back in the car and I notice that the rubber trim
that separates my windshield from my roof has come loose along the top
allowing the trim to bang on the roof. Aha!, sez I. I tuck it back into
it's groove but it's very, very loose. I know it's going to come out again
so I start looking for something to glue it down with. Glue is not
something that I normally carry with me so I'm not surprised when I don't
find any. The only glue like thing I can find in the whole care
is...Dentyne. That's right. I chew five pieces, then stick them into the
groove and tuck the trim back into it on top of the gum. It sort of seems
to stick better (bad sign). I get in the car and take off, hit 55, and the
damn thing comes loose again. I pull to the side, get out, and...you
guessed it...I have Dentyne from my windshield all the way to the rear
hatch on my beautiful Azure Blue 944. At that point, I killed myself. This
is a clone typing to you that my s.o. had made cause she missed me so
much. I managed to get Jay One's car cleaned off (in honor of his memory)
using cooking oil with only a few spots that wouldn't come perfectly
clean. Looks like Jay Two will be waxing the car again in Sept.
