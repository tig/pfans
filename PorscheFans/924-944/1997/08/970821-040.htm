	Everytime I open the hood and trace the intake path i can't help but think
to myself that there has got to be a better way for it to be done.
Unfortunately, (fortunately) since Porsche engineers have a brain and
actually thought about the design, I don't think adding a K&N cone will add
15HP. I was looking around though and I think I have some ideas:

	Build a ram air system by extending the current tube with flexible tubing
down through the fender and building a scoop under the car. The only danger
here is hydrolock. I think at speed this could add some top end power. 

	I've noticed that when I stop my car and open the hood the engine
compartment seems to be a lot hotter than any other car I've owned. I think
Porsche engineers had a very good reason to put the intake snout inside of
the fender where they did. But, I was wondering if anyone had actually done
any temperature measurements to see just how hot the airbox area gets while
the car is in motion at say 30MPH. I'd be curios to see how much hotter it
is than the fender area. If it's not that much hotter than maybe a velocity
tube and K&N cone would work where the current airbox filter is. But,
considering where the radiator, alternator, and intake manifold are located
I think that area is a bit warm even while moving. That got me thinking
about several ideas though. I thought that maybe I could replace the Mahle
filter with the corresponding K&N unit (not a cone, just replacement) and
then modify the airbox cover. I was thinking of just cutting out the right
side (where the pipe fits in), the front, and the top. This would leave the
left and rear sides in place acting as a primitive heat shield from the
engine but it would let lots of air get sucked into the full filter area. 

	I got another idea too, I'm just not sure how much space I would have. I
think inside the bottom of the fender there is enough room for a K&N cone
element. A veelocity pipe from the AFM to the cone inside the filter would
have several advantages. First, you would get the cool air from the
isolated fender area. Second, you get the larger exposed filter area of the
K&N cone. Lastly, a turbulance-free air stream is guaranteed to the AFM.
I've noticed that Bosch AFM tend to not like K&N cones put right up to
their intakes. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Anyone tinker with
the intake before with any results?
