Hello fellow enthusiasts,

Having yet another problem with my 1984 944.  I have, since November, 
replaced the water pump, rad, battery, timing belt (twice), and 
clutch.  Having just graduated from university a year and a half ago, this has 
obviously been tough to handle financially.

My new problem is with my transmission.  So far, the mechanic has 
determined that, at the very least, the crown and pinion are gone.  
He has suggested three options: 1) Replace only the bad parts plus the 
bearings, etc., 2) Replace the whole unit with a rebuilt one, or 
3) Rebuild my unit.

No option is cheap.  One saves a bit on parts, but costs more 
for labour, and visa versa for the others.  I would get a two new 
warranty if I choose to have them rebuild my unit.  The car has only 
90 k miles on it.  I missed picking up a used unit for $600 cdn by 
about three weeks (lucky John Lowe).

I will probably hang on to the car for at least one more year.  I am 
looking to buy a 951 to replace it when I can afford it. 

Any helpful feedback would be appreciated.
