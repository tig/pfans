Woo hoo,


Finally recieved my rebuilt turbo today.  Amazingly it looks brand spanking
new, pristine, ready for abuse.

Anyway, I had the turbo rebuilt at Turbo Engineering Corporation out of Golden,
Colorado.  They charge $180 for labor, $130 for parts.  They do the usual turbo
stuff (balance, test, etc...).

Unfortunate for me there was something damaged inside the turbo, a $130 part.
 Don't know what, something the previous rebuilder did...don't know who.

Total cost was $457 (price includes shipping).

Now I have everything assembled, turbo, 2.8L/k-27 computer chips, gaskets!!!!

Hopefully by this weekend I can have everything up and running, if I don't have
to go to the Dallas/Fort Worth area again... :(
