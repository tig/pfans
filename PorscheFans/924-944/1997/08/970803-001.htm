I don't know.. My brakes are great, much better than any car I have driven
by far. But I haven't driven many cars, and certainly not any other sports
cars, so I don't really know. But the brakes are the second thing people who
have driven my car comments, after commenting how low it is. It goes a
little something like this: "Damn, I'm sitting on the floor here! Damn,
these brakes are good!" I don't have disc brakes in the rear, btw.

Doorhinge.. How, what? My driver's side hinge is worn, is it easy to
replace? Can I just replace the pin, or do I need to do some serious
welding?
