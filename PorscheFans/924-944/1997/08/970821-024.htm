 Hi, Lee,

Well, I saw a wonderful variant of the design today. One of the =
Connecticut fellows at Lime Rock had
a tiedown point that was essentially a large washer (with a large eye =
hole) that used the rear shock
lower  mounting bolt to secure it...

|When I took my "splash pan" off the first time I changed the oil and
|filter, I never even gave a second thought about re-installing it.  I =
just
|scrubbed it down, rinsed it off, and put it up in the garage rafters.  =
The
|only thing I saw it would splash was the oil that dripped out of the =
old
|filter upon removal - why bother with it!!
|
|On another subject, although I think it was lightly covered some time =
ago,
|has anyone on the list come up with an easy to make and install =
tie-down
|device for the rear end of our cars to put where the original factory
|points were?  It gets to be a real PITA either using an axle strap or
|running the tie down straps thru the rear wheels.  It would be so much
|easier to just be able to use a snap hook like on the front eyes under =
the
|engine.  TIA
