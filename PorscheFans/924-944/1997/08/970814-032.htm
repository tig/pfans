*Strong* advice to follow:

Check your door trim....I have an '87 944S with 73K in vgc.  While humming
down the highway a couple of weeks ago, my side molding (right) departed
suddenly.  As traffic was a bit heavy, and the next exit was a lot of miles
away, I soothed myself, and went on my way.  

When I finally found one, used, I had to pay $106 for it, and repaint it as
well.  New they run $150 and have to be painted too.  I have checked my
other moldings, left door loose, left 16 ventilor piece loose, and right
rear piece loose!!!!  From what I understand, the 16 Ventilor (6" long) is
almost unobtainable.  

FWIW-Door Handles, mine had no logo on it, and the '87 Audi handle was fine.
