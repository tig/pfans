The 944 Turbo piston is designed with a lower "deck height" overall than
the normal piston. That is, the turbo piston crown is designed to sit lower
in the cylinder at Top Dead Center (TDC) than the normal piston. Also, the
Turbo pistons are (were?) forged, not cast like the normal ones. In
addition, there is a great deal more material in the forging, especially
around the wrist pin, wehre it's solid alloy, and not the open-cast "web"
of the normal piston. You would htink you were looking at two different
cars (well, you are, sort of....)

Another tack comes to me as we talk. If you have the Turbo pistons already,
that means you've had the engine apart before. Did the prior work cause the
cracked head?  Another thought: If you have Turbo pistons, you may be able
to use a used 944 Turbo head, instead of modifying a normal one. Another
source for this stuff is Kempton Brothers in Tampa, FL. 800-237-2026. Also,
try Aase Bros. in Anaheim, CA, 800-744-4444.
