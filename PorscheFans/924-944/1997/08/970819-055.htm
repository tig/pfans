When I took my "splash pan" off the first time I changed the oil and
filter, I never even gave a second thought about re-installing it.  I just
scrubbed it down, rinsed it off, and put it up in the garage rafters.  The
only thing I saw it would splash was the oil that dripped out of the old
filter upon removal - why bother with it!!

On another subject, although I think it was lightly covered some time ago,
has anyone on the list come up with an easy to make and install tie-down
device for the rear end of our cars to put where the original factory
points were?  It gets to be a real PITA either using an axle strap or
running the tie down straps thru the rear wheels.  It would be so much
easier to just be able to use a snap hook like on the front eyes under the
engine.  TIA

I think I'll stop using my customary 3rd line for a while(I don't want to
cry each time)
