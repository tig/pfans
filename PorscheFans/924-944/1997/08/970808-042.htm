There is a lot to be said about the NA cars.  After owning both an 87 944 
and a 89 Turbo S, I can say the lag is a bit weird.  I suspect it is 
really an illusion that the 944 NA is quicker at low rpm.

If you compare the torque and horse power between the 944 and the Turbo 
(both 1989 models), the Turbo has more of everything at any rpm except 
below 2000 rpm.

The torque curve is much flatter for the NA car, and the turbo has a 
fairly steep climb.  Still, once you progress beyond 2000 rpm, the turbo 
wins on all fronts.  

Now, here is where the illusion comes in.  The NA car maintains the 
torque and give you the feeling of aggressive pull up to the 3700 rpm 
range where the tangent on the horse power curve increases a bit and 
pulls to a maximum of 5700 rpm.

The turbo takes its time to get to 2000 rpm and then starts a steeper 
torque and horse power climb than the NA.  Torque for the turbo at 2000 
rpm is slightly greater than the maximum the NA 944 gets at 4000 rpm. For 
the turbo, the horse power is at 80 % of the turbo's maximum at 4000 
rpm(just shy of 200 for the 89 turbo).  However, the turbo keeps climbing 
till it hits 6000 rpm and peaks at 247 horse power, while the torque 
curve just keeps dropping after 4000 rpm.  The boost on the turbo is so 
massive compared to the lumbering of the sub 3500 rpm range, that the 
lower rpm "feels" very weak (anemic) in comparison to the neck snapping 
of the higher rpm ranges.

What compounds the feeling of sluggishness at sub 3500 rpms is the 
transaxle gear ratio for the turbo.  The turbo is geared higher.  At 70 
mph in fifth gear you are only showing 2700 rpm on the tach compared to 
slightly over 3100 rpm for the NA car.  The turbo can exceed 60 mph in 
2nd gear, while the NA car can't reach 55 for the same rpm and the rev 
limiter keeps it from ever getting to 60 in 2nd gear.

This makes the lower geared NA car "feel" snappier, but the 0 to 60 times 
are much worse for the NA car than the turbo (8.0 versus 5.7 seconds).  
This is in part due to the gearing.  Any 0 to 60 time will suffer if you 
have to through an extra shift in there, but that is not all of the 
story.  The plain truth is that the turbo delivers much more horse power 
and the balk of the performance would seem to benefit from this.  Only 
the distribution of the torque and horse power make for a slow start, but 
a very rapid come back.

One way of looking at the data that would support my hypotheses is 
comparing the S2 to the Turbo.  O to 60 times for the S2 are 6.9 seconds, 
more than a second better than the 89 NA 944.  The S2 can reach 60 mph in 
second gear, but it is not at the peak horse power curve when it does, so 
there is a shift point before we get to 60.  Extrapolation of the graph 
on page 127 of my owners manual would knock off about 0.5 seconds from 
the time of 6.9 or 6.4 seconds versus 5.7 for the turbo if we didn't 
shift from second.  The turbo is still about 0.7 seconds faster than the 
S2 and 1.8 seconds faster than the NA car after removing the shift time.

The last component is that the turbo just seems to be going way slower 
than what the speedometer reads.  70 mph is a lazy Sunday afternoon 
stroll for the Turbo.  100 mph doesn't require the turbo to even break 
its composure.  This makes the car seem slower than it really is, much to 
the benefit of the municipalities.

These are just my impressions, hypotheses, observations, and comparisons 
from my owners manual and actual seat time.  I have owned a 1987 944, a 
1987 944S, and a 1989 Turbo all at the same time for a number of months.  
I have had the opportunity to get seat time in all three during that 
tenure and can honestly say that getting into the 944 after extensive 
time in the turbo is not the disappointment that you might expect.  There 
is no doubt that it is slower, the suspension a bit more wobbly, and it 
lacks the explosive power of the turbo, but it still is a most impressive 
car.  I sold that car last month and I will miss it, but the turbo is an 
outstanding car too, just different.  In fact, it is hard to believe that 
they are really the "same" car at all when you drive them.  Still, they 
are all Porsches and that is what matters most.
