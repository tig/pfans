Bernie, I honestly don't know how different a 924S is from a 944 Turbo,
I'm sure they are similar enough to recommend replacing the rear crank
seal, all exhaust sealing rings, and all heat resistant exhaust nuts.
Since you have to drop the half-shafts to get the tranny out of the way,
you should go ahead and take them completely out of the car and send them
to a drive shaft specialty shop.  My local shop charged me $40 to
completely disassemble the CV joints, and clean, inspect, reassemble, and
repack them.  You might want to install new CV boots while you are at it.
They vary widely in price, but are about $15 from Imparts (the cheapest
place).  Some of the list members did this themselves, but it's messy, and
it's nice to have a professional opinion (mine had a cracked cage).
Good time to change the tranny fluid (see Barry Lenoble's notes) and
fuel filter, too.  Good luck with the job.  If you live near me
(Baltimore), I'll help!
