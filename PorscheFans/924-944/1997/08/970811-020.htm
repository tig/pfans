Hi Guys,
There are two ways to fix the hinge.  1) you can replace the whole frame (I
believe its what you are describing below).  I just did this as I wanted it
as OEM as possible. Cost me about $35 from Automotion - I believe thats
where I got it.  I was disappointed as the plastic flexing hinge looks like
its almost ready to break again.  The other way to do it is to buy a piano
hinge (any hardware store) and cut it to the right length and screw it over
the broken hinge.  You can also order a hinge from one of the mail order
places (not sure which I saw it in - Tweeks or Performance Prods maybe).  I
will do this when my new one breaks.
