Subject: 968 Models


     Hello,
    =20
     I looked through the FAQ but couldn't find anything on this. What =
are=20
     the differences between the 968 Coup=E9 and 968 CS (Club Sport)?  =
Are=20
     there other models? Is it just the level of options or is the CS (=
Club=20
     Sport) really a racing machine as someone told me?
    =20
     I test drove a 968 Coup=E9 yesterday. Very nice car. One question:=
 I=20
     found that the clutch was very high (ie. you had to let the pedal =
up a=20
     long way before it bit). Could this be a potential problem?=20
    =20

     Thanks,
     Paul.


Hi,

My fisrt Porsche test drive was a 968 CS, a really nice car!
now I have a 944 turbo (model '90), my brother a 968 coupe (model '93)

About the difference between the coupe and the CS:
The CS is about 60 kg lighter. They managed to do this by removing electrical
accessories like power windows/mirrors, power seats, less isolation, no
back seats, no radio or pre-radio. Also the fronts seats in the CS are
real racing seats.

The engine is exactly the same, 240 HP, the suspension on the CS is lowered.
The wheels on the CS are 17" cup design, in the same color as the car!
But the normal (silver) cup wheels are a free option.
They also have the same 6 speed gearbox.

In driving both cars, there is a difference, the CS is more fun!
Of course the difference is not that big like a Carrera 2 / Carrera RS !!
