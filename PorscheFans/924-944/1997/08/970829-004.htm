A hint with respect to windshield replacements (I have never done this as 
the one brick that came all the way through the my old Accord's windshield 
did so at about 2AM but...):  If you are asked if a rock that flew from the 
bed of a vehicle and broke your windshield hit the ground first consider 
the following.
Most state laws say that the driver of a truck is responsible for any 
objects being thrown from his truck or by his truck unless said object 
contacts anything else prior to your car when it is then an act of god.
