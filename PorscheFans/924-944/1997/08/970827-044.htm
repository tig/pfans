Of the two people who have looked at my '87 951 I have for sale, both of
them have also noted something about the front bumper covers of some of t=
he
951s they have seen which is something that also afflicts my car.  One si=
de
of the fender portion of the bumper cover sticks-out a little more than
normal.  I have noticed this flaw on several 951s I have seen also. I hav=
e
also seen 951s with both sides sticking out a little too much.

I'm guessing this may be caused by the polyurethane nose drooping a littl=
e,
thus causing the fender portion to stick out a bit.  My bumper cover was
replaced with a  used part though....  Anyone else noticed this or better=

yet - can it be easily fixed?
<

Dean,

Sorry, easily fixed and Porsche do not go together.  The easy fix would b=
e
to give it a whack and see if you could align it that way.  Getting to th=
e
bolts is a PITA but since you asked.  Pull the wheel and open the access
door in the front of the fender well.  Remove the plastic finger nuts fro=
m
the running light and remove.  Take a 1/4" drive 10mm universal socket an=
d
loosen the bolts holding the urethane nose to the fender.  Align, tighten=

and reverse the procedure.  There is not much room to work through the
access panel so you probably would be better off removing the plastic
fender liner, I did.

Sorry to hear you are selling your car.  Hope you hang in with the list, =
I
always enjoyed your comments.
