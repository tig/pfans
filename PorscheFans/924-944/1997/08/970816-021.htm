You answered your own question on this one, you just got a bit turned
around.  I believe that you were thinking that friction force and
coefficient of friction were one and the same.  The book is right,
coefficient of friction does not depend on suface area, it is a material
property.  I believe the equation you found was that friction force is a
product of the coefficient of friction muliplied by the normal force.  As
you can see the "force" and the "coefficient " of friction are two seperate
parts.  The normal force of a given body is usually mass multiplied by
acceleration due to gravity or "weight".  Further we know that mass is
material density multiplied by volume, and surface area is dependant on
volume. So this is how surface area is incorporated into the general
friction force equation.

How this jives with the real world, I have no clue.  It must have been the
part of physics class that I dozed through...:^)
