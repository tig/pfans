I also removed the P/S reservoir and trimmed the seams. This was ~6kmiles ago, 
and still no leaks. I also made a gasket for the P/S reservoir lid, perhaps 
there is a stock gasket, but mine was missing. I also replaced the hose 
clamps. You might try finding some hydraulic fluid hose to replace the section 
in question, certainly would be less expensive than the OEM replacements.

Good Luck!
