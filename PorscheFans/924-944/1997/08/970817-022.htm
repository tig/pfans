Hello everybody.  I am thinking about buying a 944, it will be my first 
Porsche.  Currently, I have a VW Corrado, and while it's ok, I want 
something exceptional.

I am looking for information, basically anything I can get my hands on 
so I can educate myself.  Also, and opinions and hints, such as models 
to stay away from, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

I really like the 944 Turbos.  It is my understanding that they were 
made from 1986-1989.  Is this true?  

What can I get for around $15000-$20000?  

This car will be my daily driver, with probably 20-30K miles a year put 
on the car.  How reliable are they?  How about the Turbo models?

So far, I guess I can get a older Turbo, or a newer "S" model.  

Once again, thanks in advance for your help, please email me or reply 
via the list.
