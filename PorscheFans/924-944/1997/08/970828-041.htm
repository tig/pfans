John,
Welcome, you have purchased one of the best performing cars in the
world. To bad about the previous owner. Anyway it sounds as though
someone was trying to get more performance and screwed up in the
process. Check all the vaccum lines and hoses, specifically the hose
that leads to the wastegate (under the passenger side of the vehicle)
This controls the wastegate, if there is a hole or tear in this line the
turbo will overboost the engine will momentarily shut down until things
calm down: ie, lifting foot off gas. As far as the gauge sticking open
dont waste your time trying to figure this one out as it is electrical
not mechanical. Get yourself an aftermarket gauge (mechanical) that
truly reads boost pressure. You will need this if you raise your boost
anyway.
