This is my first post to the 924-944 list, so I'll try to br brief....
Help!

After spending the day replacing half shafts, brakes (4 rotors & and
Pagid pads), bleeding the system, re-hanging the exhaust system, etc.  -
my steering column must have decided I was ignoring it, so it manifested
its own problem for my attention.  The problem is this  - somewhere in
the column, it squeaks.  Turn the wheel about 1/8 turn and it sounds
like a bearing or bushing is squeaking. Its the first time I've noticed
it and its not the wheel hub (already fixed that squeak) but rather,
sounds like its hidden in the engine compartment.  The noise comes from
above .the rack.  Is there a u-joint or column bearing hidden under the
engine/turbo plumbing somewhere?  Has anyone else experienced this?  Any
"simple" fixes" or where to begin looking.  Love to get it sorted out
tomorrow or Monday, so please email as well as post to the list.

Thanks in Advance
