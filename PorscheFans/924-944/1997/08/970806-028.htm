Which you probably would have invested even more money in. I'd rather have a
perfect 944 than a FBR 911. What fun is having a Porsche if it doesn't shine
like a Porsche?

Sometimes I'm glad Norwegian car prices are as high as they are. Having paid
$12.500 for my 924, I can justify keeping it in a shape that would make
Ferry himself proud. Imagine what you could do to an $18.000 '83 944! Or a
$27.000 '86 951, or a $50.000 '87 911 Carrera! Suddenly an investment of
$4000 to get it in tip-top shape doesn't seem too steep.

How are 944s treated in the US? Even with the car prices being what they are
over here, most 944s and even 911s are treated like dirt (or so it seems).
Most 944s I wouldn't even offer a glance, and many 911s are sadly neglected
as well. They are mostly owned by spoiled brats and yuppies, I guess. :/
