Same thing here on my '86 951.  The fact that it never has squeaked at
freeway speeds makes me think that it comes from the seal area as well. 
The pressure generated by the wing on the hatch seems to push it down
hard enough to prevent it from loosely rubbing and therefore squeaking.

Also, ambient temperature seems to make a difference.. on really hot
days, it is fairly uncommon, on cooler days or morning/evening hours, it
does squeak quite a bit.  Humidity appears to be a factor, too.

I'm wondering whether the hatch just simply isn't closed tightly
enough.. or too tightly.  I need to adjust the hatch bolts anyways (my
remote release sometimes only unlocks one side of the hatch or none at
all, even
though the mechanism seems to be working just fine..), so, I'll play
around with it then.

But, I'm also open to suggestions, or even perhaps actual cure reports
;-)

Cheers,
Chris
