Assuming that White-Allen is a Porsche shop, I can verify that this
practice (subcontracting and using OEM glass) is quite common.

The Porsche dealer at my place (Malmo, Sweden) also subcontracts glass
work. They say that it is 'specialist' work and use a glass specialist
that do work for a number of different auto shops - and that certainly
sounds reasonable to me. 

The OEM vs factory glass is another question. 

Automotive glass can be described as a lo-tech product (its just 'plain'
laminated glass) with hi-tech production, as the glass need to be
exactly tailored to the application - it has to fit perfectly.  

So a windshield that fits nicely is probably OK, even if it is not
Porsche OEM - but it may well be. If it isn't it is probably made by an
OEM supplier to other major car makers instead - following rigorous
safety and quality standards common to the industry.  
 
I wouldn't worry too much about the make of the windscreen, as long at
it is DOT approved.
