Some thoughts as i read through the digest, no offense intended=85

Subject: FW: The Hella H4 thread..
>>I have found that the car is less stable above 140 with the lights on. =
This
is OK >>though because I find that you will out drive the H4s above 100MP=
H on
>>a dark road anyway.=20

Man , 140=85, out drive the lights?? I have got to get me one of these!!
I knew the 944 was fast , but lightspeed???

Subject: paint
>>I know the work will far surpass the value of the car but frankly I DON=
'T
CARE !

It=92s occured to me, gee I spent over $3k on my paint, did a lot of the =
work
myself, and still haven=92t finished the trim.. 924 owners seem to have t=
his
incredible desire to spend (not invest, but spend) all of their money on
their cars.. I think the drivetubes were designed to produce harmonics th=
at
cause a normal person to go absolutely insane over their car. Some sort o=
f
psychic(?) control or something.

>>As a wise man once said It is not the destination but the journey that
matters.
Yeah very wise,, and very ,very poor=85 :{ :}  :)=20

Subject: Dual Exhaust for 84 944
>> Does anybody know if Monza make anything like this and the
>> model number that relates do it ?

Try autoatlanta for the tips, dual go for $49.50 +s/h, and are black with
chrome tips, I added these to my 924, and love the way they look and soun=
d.
And they are "real " Monza products. You can reach them at 770-427-2844 o=
r
www.autoatlanta.com

and finally a question,, since windshields have been a hot topic, just wh=
at
is involved in changing one (and removing one intact if possible) on a 92=
4??
besides dropping it, whats are the dangers of doing it yourself??

subj: 944 automatic:
>> Marshall, per your questions about there being a "stigma" attached to
>>buying a 944 with an automatic:  I don't mean to sound elitist but I th=
ink
the vast >>majority on this list would say yes. In my opinion, the primar=
y
reason for buying >>any Porsche is the fun to be had behind the wheel (th=
en
again, this is not true for >>the gold chain crowd).  This fun will
unquestionably be diminished with an >>automatic.

Excuse me while I broil a little, ok , if the purpose is to have "fun" wh=
y
are we worried about stigma?? Drive what you like, if its an auto your
comfortable with, get one. If your driving abilites improve to where an a=
uto
no longer suits your needs or challenges your abilities, trade it for a s=
tick
and install a cupholder.  Those who stick their nose up at you because of=
 the
way you like to drive might as well be wearing the "gold chains", to me i=
ts
the same thing. Call it a flame if you want, but I dont go for the "click=
e"
mentality.  i will concede the output suffers, but hey if your not racing=
 it
might make the car more enjoyable for you, and thats the bottom line isnt
it??
