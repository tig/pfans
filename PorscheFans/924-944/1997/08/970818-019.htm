Hello P-Fans,

I turned on my A/C the other day with the blower speed set on 2 when
all of a sudden  the blower stopped working.  It worked only when set
on 4.  After checking the fuse and relay, I decided it was time for the
manuals.  After  tracing the schematic, I discovered that fan speed 0 to 3
are  controlled via 4 series resistor located on top of the air blower
assembly and speed 4 bypasses them all together (or shorts them out),
thus full speed.  I then looked at the electrical connection located on top
of the resistor assembly and found them dirty.  I then cleaned them.  Well,
it worked.   I also know that these high wattage wirewound resistors
take a beating so I decided to remove the series resistor assembly and
look inside.  After 10 years of use, they couldn't have looked better, but
they should be replaced.  Some of the resistive material on some of them
are starting to flake off and the contacts inside are tarnished. 

Now  the real reason for this thread. Has anybody ever replaced this
assembly?   It doesn't look all that easy and the manuals don't say
anything about it.  In-fact it looks like one long connection from the control
knob INSIDE to the air blower OUTSIDE via a rubber grommet.  The
thought of having to go under the dash is not exciting at all.  In fact, I'm
thinking that when they do go bad for good, I'll cut and solder  new ones
in leiu of spending hours under the dash.

Any suggestions or advise would be very much appreciated.
