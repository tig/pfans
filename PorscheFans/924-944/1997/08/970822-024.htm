     I thought there was a change in the law recently, such that H4 
     conversions are now legal. (this was within the last two years). 
     Anyway I can tell you that the conversion is WELL worth it. On my 82 
     Audi Quattro (turbo coupe) I had two h4s with 80/100 watt bulbs and 
     two 100 watt h1 high beams. If aimed properly the 80 watt bulbs are 
     inoffensive to oncoming drivers due to their perfect cuttoff. The 
     higher headlight height permitted on pickup trucks is much more 
     annoying and dangerous than well-aimed 80 watt hellas. Over two years 
     of driving I was never "flashed" and certainly never questioned by 
     police. I did alot of night driving back then and the lighting 
     improvement was phenomenal. The lives of many deer and other cute 
     woodland animals were saved by my H4's :)
