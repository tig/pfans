Thanks to all who responded to my 2nd trevia quiz (about 20 in all). 
Two respondents were having an exact problem as I had discussed, so
maybe their troubleshooting is now done for them.

The correct answer was given by three people--

George Beuselinck at 7:20 Sat. eve.
Barr Lenoble at 9:14 this morning
Chris Kalikars (I think) at 2:47 this afternoon 

All three stated that a crack in one of the fingers of the throwout arm
(release fork) will cause one of the fingers that pull on the throwout
bearing to bend, thereby not allowing the bearing to pull the plate
properly away from the flywheel.

The clutch release arm will still get its full range of travel from the
slave cylinder but this will not be transmitted to the clutch.

These does mean full removal of the bell housing to pull the throwout
arm off. If the side that contacts the throwout bearing is not worn, it


is possible to bend the finger back and to weld it back into place (I
usually strenghten both sides on race cars).  If it is too bad, the PN#
is 931.116.085.00 for the 944/924 turbo and 951.116.085.00 for the 944
turbo. 

Be sure and inspect the sleeve needle bearings (PN#.999.201.213.00) and
the shaft that runs through the bearings (PN# 951.116.133.00).

Most answers centered around a hydraulic problem, but if you reread the
post, you will see that the clutch slave and master cylinders were
operating properly and that proper release dimensions were had...it just
was not getting to the throwout bearing side of the release fork.

George wins the two oil filters, being the first to post the correct
answer.

Thanks to all...look for the next quiz
