It is sometimes true.  However, here is why:

Synthetic oils sometimes dissolve or seep thru sludge sitting in the
engine, preventing oil from seeping out thru already shrunk seals. 
Also, in the very early days of synthetic oil, the oil was more
aggressive or simply less compatible with crude based conventional
engine oils, and actually did shrink seals among many other things. 
Today, that's no longer true.  Quite a few manufacturers/models (e.g.,
Chevy switched to Mobil 1 5W-30 in their C*rvette a couple of years ago
and no longer has oil coolers on their engines since) ship with
synthetic from the factory.

Today's synthetic oils are superior.  Period.

So, IMHO, I would rather have an engine leak oil and at some point
replace the seals -- in other words: I want to know about things that
are broken so I can fix'em and not just cover them up.  

I'm running Mobil 1 5W-30 in my '86 951 w/ 91K miles and it's not
leaking a single drop of oil; engine runs noticably smoother at idle
when cold.  According to the manual, my 951 should be fine with 20W-50
or 10W-30.  Considering that the car is over a decade old and the
tremendous amount of improvements in synthetic oil properties, I don't
see why I couldn't run Mobil 1 5W-30 or 0W-30 (the latter I will try at
the next oil change).

YMMV.  

Cheers,
Chris

btw: After reading Porsche's specs on oils in the '86 951, reading
Mobil's Mobil 1 FAQ on their website and talking to Mobil engineers, I
don't think there's any reason why you couldn't run 0W-30.  High temp
characteristics are very similiar to other *W-30 oils (that's why
they're still rated -30 and not something else), and their main
difference is the much lower viscosity at lower temps.  Compare the
section in your 944 manuals for more info regarding the way oils are
rated/ranked/etc.  Keep in mind that the manual does not specify
synthetic oil characteristics when specifying the appropriate temp range
and matching oil -- synthetic oils often endure higher temps very
successfully, like the extremely hot running C*rvette engines.
