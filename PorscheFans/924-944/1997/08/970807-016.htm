The FBI, CIA, and the LA Police all claimed to be the best. To determine who
was the best they set up a little test. They released a rabbit into the
woods and then each one would try to find it. The FBI went first; after
questioning all life forms in the forest and receiving no leads, they
declared that the rabbit never existed and closed the case. Then the CIA
went after a week nothing, they burned down the forest killing all life
forms claiming the rabbit had it coming anyway. Finally the LA Police went.
They found a different forest and after only 2 hours dragged out a bloody
beaten bear that was heard crying, " OK, OK, I am a rabbit not a bear please
stop beating me!"

Ya it's not Porsche related but it's Porschearama at Limerock and I'm at work.
