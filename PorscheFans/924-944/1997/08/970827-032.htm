Hey guys,

Had to laugh at all the bantering about the police.  Can relate to both
sides of the aisle here.  Police officers, like anybody doing any kind
of job, come with varying personalities.  They are just people going to
work and doing their job like anybody else.  Their job is more dangerous
than most, but it's a job nevertheless.  You have to remember that these
guys and gals didn't write the laws that they enforce.  If you want the
speed limits changed, you have to put pressure on the legislators.

Anyway, as people they are going to have their good days and their bad
days.  Especially when they probably just got an ear full of @#$%& from
some domestic dispute (from both spouses) that they just handled, etc. 
A cop can either give you a break or give you a hard time depending on
your approach with him/her.  Antagonizing the cop that just pulled you
over with a pissed off attitude and/or smart ass remarks is the quickest
way to get the ticket you're trying to avoid.  Remember, they deal with
aggressive morons all day and when you begin that same trend, even
though we all know that you're the sophisticated law abiding citizen
that was just going a little too fast, they aren't going to take the
time to make the distinction.  You have just catagorized yourself as
meat for the quota.

As a recommendation from someone with a little experience in this
department, try the quasi-apologetic approach.  A little honey, instead
of that immediate dose of vinegar.  You may just be surprise, when
he/she hands back the license and simply says, "Ok, well just slow it
down a little." and lets you go your way.  What have you got to loose? 
You're already pulled over and a ticket is imminent.  It may just work.
I can honesty say it has worked for me on several occassions (and no, I
didn't cheat by showing a badge either...mostly because a commissioners
badge would have guaranteed a ticket.  A little payback on some out of
town brass ;))  

Lastly, I'm certainly not naive either.  I know that there are some
officers that are out of line, just as there are some officers out there
that will jump in front of the gun and take the bullet for you.  It's
the individual human factor that comes into play here.  Everyone's
different, the same is true for cops.  

If you come across an officer that is really out of line, then you have
an obligation as the law abiding public to inform his/her superiors of
that conduct.  If you get no satisfaction with the police brass, then
contact the appropriate city official.  It will be followed up, because
it has to be followed up.  If that administrator does, its his/her ass
if something goes wrong.  

I'm rambling now, but keep in mind when *&#@ really hits the fan and
your in danger...who do you call for that assistance?

P.S.:  Hey, I get tickets too.  Nobody's immune...such is life.

Happy motoring gang!  Regards, Rick (87  924S)

Oh yeah,  Anders...should have sent you a badge too.  Thanks for the
support for the guys in blue.
