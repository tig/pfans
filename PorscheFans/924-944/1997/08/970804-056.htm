Yes, it is one of the original limited edition models, with the color
code of LM3Z.  It has the turbo owners manual with the supplement for
the turbo S.  The door pockets and back seats are the original cloth but
the front seats have been recovered in burgundy vinyl (not a bad job,
but not original either).  The nice thing about this car other than the
front seats is that it is original and has not been fooled with, and it
is in great shape.  

You can call me at (817)332-6547 (off.) or (817)294-5848 (ho.) if you
wish.  

Thanks for the response.
