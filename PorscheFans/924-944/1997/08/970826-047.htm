I know the KLR unit has a pressure transducer mounted directly to the PC board where the manifold pressure line connects in order to measure boost pressure.  Just wondering if it were possible that the aftermarket chip suppliers could be a little 'enthusiastic' when reporting the boost. ( Of course they wouldn't do that !)

Of course one should allow for the possibility that the KLR pressure transducer could degrade over time.

________________________________________________________________________
On the boost gauge hookup question I junctioned in to the vaccum line
coming from the top of the intake. I believe it is the knock sensor.(it
is the only vacum line coming from the top of the intake) I cut the line
& put in a small plastic tee (local auto parts store). The factory boost
gauge is electronic. When I am reading 1 bar on the factory gauge I am
actually only at 1 lb on the aftermarket gauge! (Autometer). I don't
believe that the factory gauge will give an accurate reading of boost
pressure if you have adjusted the boost past stock level. This can be
deadly. As far as the stock reading is concerned With my boost valve
closed (factory setting) I am running between 9 - 11 lbs. With the boost
valve open it is between 15 - 17 lbs. Keep in mind however that this
boost level takes about 3-5seconds to reach.
