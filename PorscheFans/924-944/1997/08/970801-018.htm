Thanks to everyone who sent me advice on turning rotors. Last night I placed 
the car on Jack Stands. With the wheels off, I visually checked the rotors for 
warp (out of round, runout...). The front rotors were not as bad as thought, 
certainly not anywhere near 1mm runout. The rear rotors definitely looked 
warped. I removed all 4 rotors and brought them to a shop to be turned. I just 
called the shop, and the rear rotors were the only ones out of spec. My front 
rotors were within .001 inch. Just goes to show how difficult it is to tell 
which rotors are the one pulsing. I will be re-installing the rotors tonight 
(with freshly packed bearings and seals for the front). I will also be sure to 
clean all mating surfaces so the rotors are seated correctly. I will post 
again about this topic once I have put some miles on them, and see if they 
remain true.


Thanks again for the advice!
