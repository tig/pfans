Michael,

I love the new 996 ;-)... and as you can see in my sig, I'm also driving
a Wasserporsche ;-).  I suppose, it's just the same olde, same olde
bickering about changes in the Porsche family tree.  Every new Porsche
seems to have to go thru this "proving phase" where it has to show that
it is actually a worthy sibling, worthy of bearing the famed crest.  
Which, I suppose, isn't a bad thing afterall, and has probably -- to a
quite sizable amount -- contributed to where we're at today.

I don't know what gives.  Just ignore the bickering ;-)...

My wife initially scolded me for buying a Porsche.  I happen to be a
German native *sigh* and can't buy a German car, eh? ;-)  And, after a
little over a month later, now says she wants one, too.  I wonder if a
996 is in my future.  We both like the looks a lot.  I'd love to have
another fabulous Wasserporsche. ;-)

Cheers,
Christian "Why care about balls and chains of tradition if you can
