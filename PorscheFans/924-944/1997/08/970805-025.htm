Now I understand.  Before today, when I heard people talking about Porsche's
having great brakes, I kinda shrugged it off.  I assumed that my idea of good
braking was a bit higher than other peoples.  Being an avid sportbike enthusiast
as well, I assumed that I was expecting to much from the porsche, after all it's
a car not a bike.  Today, out of boredom, I decided to bleed the brakes on my
85.5 944.  I discovered that the clutch uses the same reservoir, so I bled that
as well.  I have a vacuum bleeder so I didn't just bleed, I basically removed
all of the fluid and replaced it.  I'm pretty sure it's never been done to this
car before (93K miles) because the fluid was nearly black.  (by the way, you
don't have to remove the starter to bleed the clutch like the Haynes manual
says).  I flushed nearly two quarts of fluid through the system in the bleeding
of all five lines until clear fluid came out.  Not a short job, but pretty
simple.  Anyway, back to the reason for writing, I now have Porsche Braking.
What a difference, now I know what everyone meant.   If you want to see more
braking power look at the pic of the stoppie on my motorcycle page (link there
from the porsche page below).  If you're car is up there in years like mine, and
you haven't done this, then do it.  It's worth the trouble.  The clutch feels
better too.

off the ground)
