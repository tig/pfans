I have an 89 951 that is almost drinking PS fluid.  As recommended by folks 
here I checked all of the hoses and found no obvious leaks; however, I was 
under it today and noticed a rubber plug in the bottom of the steering rack 
on the driver's side.  The plug looked pretty bad so I pulled it out and PS 
fluid started draining but not alot of it, it was a trickle compared to 
what you would expect if this plug were really designed to hold the fluid 
in under any pressure.  So, my question is: Is this plug really designed to 
seal in the PS fluid or is the a plug that merely covers an access point to 
an internal adjustment?  If this is just a cover, what does it mean if I 
have PS fluid leaking out of it???  I called the dealer and they can't find 
the plug on their parts fiche so I have to drive down there later this 
week.

Any Ideas???

Thanks!!!
