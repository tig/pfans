The "Certificate of Authenticity" as supplied by PCNA for my 1989 951
indicates I have the "Turbo Lettering, Right Front Fender" option. Luckily,
the decal was gone when I bought the car and there's no trace of it.

There's an article in the 12/88 Pano (check Upfixen vol. VIII, p. 280)
which has a picture of a 951S with this lettering. Yes, it's ugly, but so
is the Carrera CS logo on page 250. At least they didn't paint it on!
