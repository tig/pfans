I totally agree.  An unrelated (sort of) question: what's the advantage of
rear drive versus front drive?  I assume it has to do with all the weight
going to the back on acceleration (so better traction).

Here's another one: what's the so-called "safety" of front-wheel drive? 
My parents have driven both front- and rear-wheel drive cars in all
climates and neither has noticed a significant difference.  However, a
friend with a VW Super Beetle or something says he does notice a
difference.  I assume this, too, has to do with weight transfer, but from
what I understand, a skillful driver who knows better than to push the car
through a corner on snow could do just as well in either car.

Would this be one of those "for stupid drivers it's okay" things?

I thought this would make more sense.  Then the obvious question: why
isn't it used in normal cars?  Too expensive?  I don't know that I'd be
able to give up the stick, but I'd actually consider it if an automatic
worked like that.

Not surprising.  Doubtless if any are sold in Japan, they do well there,
as well.  I have a great deal of contempt for the average American driver. 
Especially ones rich enough to own a Ferrari.

>concept. 

Actually, it opened itself up to the large expanse of American (and,
although nobody likes to admit it, European) drivers who really don't want
to drive a stick.  I have to admit that in slow traffic, or stop-and-go
traffic, I sometimes wish for a decent automatic.  Most drivers aren't
interested in shifting for better performance.

By making a manual-only 968, Porsche would be eliminating over half of the
people who could afford the car before we even started talking features
and preferences.  They need money, too.  This is much less a compromise
than some of the ones we've been hearing about lately.

Again, why didn't they?  The technology was there.  The ability was there. 
The desire was - probably - there.  I'm guessing cost is the problem. 
Porsche was already pushing the borders of truth by calling the 968 an
inexpensive car.  If they had to add $8000 or whatever for a system most
people couldn't tell from the Tiptronic... well, it'd be dumb.
