Nick -

Check your engine serial #:
	If it starts with either XH or XF(Calif.), it is 95hp @ 5500rpm
	If it starts with either XG or XE(Calif.), it is 110hp @ 5750rpm

        Um, I believe you're terribly mistaken.  But that's okay because this is 
        just a Porsche list anyway.  The current Z28's and Trans Ams are all 
        terrorizing the stoplights with small-blocks, and Suburbans, Caprice 
        Classics, and of course Corvette LT1's are all equipped with the small 
        block as well (but I realize some of these are no longer in production). 
        They're all Chevy (GM) small-blocks with different heads.  In fact, the 
        4.3 liter V6 in some Blazers (S10 Pickup trucks too?) can be considered 
        part of the small-block family as well.
                So I wouldn't exactly say that GM has abandoned the small-block. 
         It's alive and will probably still be kicking for a few more years to 
        come.  But enough about the small-block.  Let's talk about our 
        turbocharged, water-cooled 4-bangers instead!

While I have no doubt that the new water-cooled engine is a great
     piece of work, I am upset to see the end of the original air-cooled 
     911.  It's as if everyone had abandoned the small-block Chevy
engine
     and we had lost our roots.
     
Um, GM has abandoned the small block Chevy.
