A ducting kit would be the best long-term answer, but I was looking for
something easy I could do now to get a bit more cooling. I don't think
I'm boiling them since I don't experience any fade, but they do get hot
enough to get that 'used-the-brakes-really-hard-this-session' smell. The
'89 Turbo has the Brembo Brakes from the 928S so it takes a decent
amount of effort to fade them. And at the last event, John Potter
noticed some hairline cracks developing on the LF rotor (the one that
gets all the abuse at Bridgehampton).

Most of the NA 944s do use the fog light holes in the airdam for
ducting. I'm not sure what the best way is for Turbos...

As for my long-term plans, I'm still in limbo. I probably want to keep
the car dual-purpose at least to the extent that it can be driven to
events and possibly to club races to compete in the stock class. I have
to decide whether or not to go with a full cage or a roll bar. (I'm 6'4"
so I can't stand much roof collapse without getting truncated. My helmet
is in constant contact with the roof as it is. <g>) Going to Fabcar
control arms is probably somewhere in the future. So is a drivers seat,
less compliant bushings, strut tower brace, brake ducting, and any other
mods that will keep me in the stock class for club racing. 

Then again, I may buy a kart and get into racing that way. The '89 Turbo
would make a dandy tow vehicle. In that case, I'd probably just put in a
roll bar and drivers seat to give myself some safety leeway during
drivers ed events.
