Well, I guess I will, too.

From what I've seen, I'm disappointed.  The styling is rather
questionable, IMO, for the first significant engine change ever in the
911.  Considering the gravity of the situation, I'd think Porsche would
make a really sharp-looking car.  It looks like crap.

What's wrong with that is that I'd rather see no more Porsches than
something like a Porsche minivan.  The del Sol and the new 911 I can
handle; Porsche will make them into sportscars to some degree, no matter
what they look like.  The minivan one really disappoints me.

I doubt noise is a significant issue.  Most American sportscars are
louder.

Actually, this one is (presumably) based on the 959 -- a proven engine if
nothing else is.  Also, the Boxster seems stable enough that a derivative
would work out OK.  And do you really think that Porsche would sell a car
that couldn't succeed on the racetrack?  I'm not sure, but isn't the '97
LeMans terror water-cooled?

I don't doubt that the new 911 will the piece of quality engineering that
we've come to expect from Porsche.  However, I do think that the experts
in Germany are making this more of an engine upgrade than a whole-car
upgrade; after all, the costs on the water-cooled 911 are supposed to be
only 5% (is that right?) more than the current one.  Considering worldwide
inflation, that's not much of a hike at all.

My complaint is that it's not everything I was promised.  In fact, a lot
of stuff is missing.  I was told that it was going to be a mid-engine
design complete with suspension improvements.  The power was supposed to
be greater, as was the engine size.  The brakes on the NA model were, so I
was told, going to approach twin-turbo size (although they wouldn't make
it).  A lot of features would become standard, an old Porsche ploy for
claiming to keep the costs down.  You know -- an overall upgrade.  The
"new 911" seems, so far, to be the old 911 with a different body and a
bigger Boxster engine.

I'm awaiting the Porsche minivan with a great deal of dread.
