Maybe the 8V motors are not as picky as the 16V motors, but I thought that
all 944 timing belts had to be retensioned after ~1000miles of being
replaced.  Does this not apply to turbos?  

I am asking because I test drove an 86T yesterday and the owner told me
that the timing belt had been replaced but when I asked about the
retensioning, he said he had done no such thing and his mechanic had
never mentioned it to him.  I feel like he is driving a time bomb and felt
bad test driving the car.

TIA
