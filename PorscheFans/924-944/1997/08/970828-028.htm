Mike Concordia wrote about his sunroof cable being broken.  Before you go
through the trouble of replacing it, might I suggest something?

I had the same problem on my car.  My sunroof mechanism (whole assembly) is
something that I have not seen pictured in the manual.  The PO lent his car to
his sister in law for the day and she backed it into a light pole.  The side
that was hit was the side that had all of the sunroof mechanics on it and
whoever fixed that part of the car really did a number on it.

Anyway.  I took off both gear assembly plates 5 screws/side).  The manual says
to not do this but I did and cannot to this day figure out why the manual
states this.  I removed the black arms and then removed the plastic gears (be
careful to not loose the washer).  I couldn't see the cable on the passenger
side of the car.  My first thought was big $$$.  I then put the key in the car
and hit the sunroof button to raise the roof.  To my good fortune, the cable
reappeared and I was back in business.

I realize that this isn't the answer to my sunroof problems but it opens,
closes, and can be removed and that is good enough for me.  I just have to be
careful when closing or the arms go all the way in and the back of my sunroof
will be flopping in the wind.

Hopes this solves you problem.
