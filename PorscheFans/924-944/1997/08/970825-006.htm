In my quest to find a Porsche, I came across an 86 NA with such a plastic
piece, the kind that lights up.  The red plastic had faded and spoiled the
looks of the read end.  In addition, there were these wires going to the
lights of the new licence plate bracket (since the plate has to be moved)
that were sticking out. I understand that a cleaner installation might
have helped and maybe the factory piece looks fine on a 924, but it did
nothing for the 944.  If you want to jazz up the rear end add a turbo rear
lower spoiler, it will not be a stock look but better looking, IMHO.

Definite nea! (IMHO)
