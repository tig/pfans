I think the problems were a combination of driver, 300 HP, Texas-style
drag racing, and the little springs that go snap. I know the first
clutch failure was blamed on the little springs and I'm almost positive
it was blamed in the 2nd incident as well. The PO was very unhappy with
Carlsen of Palo Alto as they stripped a lot of the bolts on the first
installation that were found on the 2nd.

When I let a friend drive the car with me in the passenger seat, he
stalled it the first time he tried to get going. He then stalled it
again at a light waiting to make a right turn. Then he gave it a bit too
much gas and slipped the clutch out with the wheel cranked to complete
the turn. The combination lit the clutch up and I thought it was ruined.
I hate that smell! I guess it's now on it's second or third or ninth
life... I've never had a problem with it since this is my 2nd 944 and
I'm used to the idiosyncrasies. But I'll probably never let another
friend drive it.

But I think the lesson to be learned is that Porsche probably knows what
they are doing when they limited the HP to 250 and the boost to .8 on
these cars. They were designed to have plenty of tolerance so driving
styles won't have so many negative reprocussions. If I got into a 700 HP
Trans Am car, I'd probably stall it and then fry the clutch on the 2nd
attempt to get going.
