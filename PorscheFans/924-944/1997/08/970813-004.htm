Don't trash that chip!

I can (almost always) salvage a broken leg on an IC chip.  There are two 
ways to do it.  First, resolder a new pin on, or second, resolder a short 
piece of #30 wire on and add an additional socket.  I can then reprogram 
a new chip.  I have done this many times before.

Contact me if you want to do this.
