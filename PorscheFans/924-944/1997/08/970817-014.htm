I'll second that.  The circuit allows for continuity throught the sensor 
until the sensor is worn enough that the circuit opens and the light 
turns on.  Check the wires around the brake caliper area.  I have seen a 
few cars that have had a wire to the sensors break or get worn through and 
it only takes one bad wire to turn the light on.
