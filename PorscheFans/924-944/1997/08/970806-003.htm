Bill,
     Welcome to the world of aged rubber. I replaced all of the gaskets, 
o-rings,etc..  on my engine last winter, all needed replacement. To get at the 
oil pan gasket, you MUST remove the crossmember, which supports the engine, 
and has the steering rack attached to it. I made an engine hoist that rests on 
the strut braces, let me know if you are interested in the details. Other 
items that will need to be removed: engine shield, flywheel shield, balance 
belt cover, engine mounts...
Have fun!
         Ezra
