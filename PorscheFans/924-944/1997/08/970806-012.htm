It's not State Farm per se, but probably the local underwriter.  I have
State Farm and for my son's '89 Turbo which is insured in my name since
I'm on the title we have $500 D collision and $100 D comprehensive with
100/300 liability and normal other coverage.  I pay $430 per 6 months =
with
an accident free, multi car discount.  At times over the last 20+ years
I've thought about switching but nobody has ever beaten their rates by an
appreciable amount to make it worthwhile.
