Ok first Id like to thank all the people on the list who have  taken the

time to give me words of support and advice.  After sorting through all
the letters I've received I am a little less depressed.  Initially I
thought I would loose all the money just spent to pay off my car.  I
could only imagine that nobody would be interested in a Porsche that was

involved even in the smallest accident.  From what I hear I guess I was
wrong.  The best way for me to go I guess would be to accept the highest

offer to either sell the car whole or part it out.  Im located In Denver

, Colorado.  My car is a guards red 86 951.  The dash is not cracked and

the interior is in great shape.  I have 4 Fuch's(spelling?) as rims,
unbent, very minor curb scratches on one or two (from the P.O.).  The
carpet Is in excellent condition.  There are two recaro seats in it with

leather trim and Gray "Porsche" fabric.  The drivers seat has a hole 1/3

rd the size of a dime in the leather trim on the side back rest of the
chair.  I assume it was from a Cigarette.  The rear seats are in
excellent shape,  with an even smaller hole on in the drivers side rear
seat fabric.  The seat fabric in the whole car is not stained.
Also the sunroof is in good shape undented.  The rear hatch is still
unbent and in good shape.  The rear spoiler rubber is not cracked and
still soft.  The front windshield has a small scratch on it from the
drivers side windshield wiper not having a blade in it.
I guess that probably happened at the dealership.  The hood is dent
free.  I guess maybe the best way to do this is if you need a part that
you think is on the car, let me know and give me an offer for it.  Ill
take peoples offers for about a week, or until I get one that I cant
pass up.  I would also like to sell the car whole if anyone is
interested in it.  Just send your highest offer. Im trying to move to
Germany by the end of September, so I will try to minimize  my losses
before then.  I really must take the time to once again thank the people

on the list who have wrote me.  Its nice to know that their are allot of

people who don't mind giving advice and who are honest and helpful still

around today.  I have never owned a Porsche before, and when I finally
bought and paid off mine , it was like a dream come true.  In the two
weeks that I owned the car, I got to enjoy the best handling automobile
that I have ever had the opportunity to drive.  I was able to put 18
coats of wax/ polish on it ,too.  In the hours that I spent detailing
the car I enjoyed every minute of it- as I got to see even the smallest
detail and inginuitive excellence that went into the design and over all

craftsmanship of the entire vehicle.  The car completely earned my
respect in the time we spent driving together.  I will be looking
forward to the next opportunity that I have to own a Porsche. I will
also stay a member of this list and look forward to hearing of others
experiences with their Porsche's too.
