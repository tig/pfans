I'll stick my toasted neck ot, in spite of my earlier promise to keep
off this topic...

But as this was a private answer to a private message, I'll think I am
allowed a reply.    

Please reread my first post, and see that I am a 'Honorary' police
officer only, of Cambridge, Ohio. 

My law knowledge come from studying law in Sweden many years ago. Now,
I'll bet my *** that general law principles apply over at your place too
- as they are surprisingly similar.     
 
As for my bold statement about policemen not needing to obey speed
limits, it was a bit incomplete. It may be even worse...

Police officers are, just like ordinary people, allowed to break what is
generally considered 'the law'. The principal reasoning is that breaking
the law is justificable IF (and this is a BIG if...) there is a
worthwhile gain, and no reasonable legal way to solve the problem. 

For police officers, this right is even more regulated and defined, as
they very often get into situations where they have to do what otherwize
could have been a serious crime. They are also given powers and training
that exceed ordinary citizens and will also be expected (by law) to act
and react 'better' than ordinary people, when provoked, challenged or
threatened - so the power does not come without obligations.       

For ordinary people, this principle is usually pictured by the situation
where a neighbor is passing a house. Then he sees a hot iron standing on
the ironing table, smoking, threatening to set fire on the house. The
neighbour then breaks the glass (causing damage) and enters the house
(burglary). He then pulls out the plug of the iron and in general, saves
the day.

A court would (very simpliefied) rule that the breach of law was
justified, and the nighbour would not been found guilty of a crime.

(That some people probably would try sue the pants off him for damages
is another matter. That is a civil process, and have nothing to do with
a criminal act. The US seem to have very different standards here)

The police speeding parallel would be breaking a speed limit to reach a
scene for a ongoing burglary, chasing a bank robber, or pursuing a
speeding car. There is to my knowledge no way to tell a police officer
in a hurry from a police officer with plenty of time on his hands...

Comforting anecdote: 

A Swedish MD drove way to fast to an urgent (lifesaving) operation. On
the way he was pursued by a unpainted police car. The police did not
grasp the situation at all, and followed the doctor, not only to the
emergency ward, but all the way in to the operating theatre, trying to
enforce the speeding. The MD then 'whacked' the police officer to free
himself and make the operation. The MD was in prosecuted, and found 'not
guilty'... (But I don't know if he drove a
Porsche)                       
Obligatory Porsche content:

The Swedish traffic police (highway patrol) used Porsches for patrolling
during the late 60's and early 70's. They were used to chase speeders...
