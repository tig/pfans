I have recently joined this large, prestigious and intelligent group 
of Porsche aficionados.  I was the happy and very proud owner of a 1973 
911E.  I have now moved into the 1986 951 world.  I apologize in advance 
for my ignorance.



I have owned the car for about 3 months.  It has been at my local 
dealership's service department for about 2/3 of this time.  Four separate 
visits.  Yes, I have learned the importance of pre-purchase inspections, 
etc.  The car was beautiful, but abused mechanically.  Looks were 
deceiving.  Alright, now that I have spent $$$ thousands getting the 951 in 
shape (CV joints, belts, bearings, etc.) I am looking to assure the 
perormance end is up to "snuff".



The Turbo gauge does not work, it is "stuck" on 1.0 permanently.  
Under hard acceleration, the car momentarily shuts down at 4,200 RPM.  The 
Porsche mechanic told me the wastegate may be opening up prematurely. He 
also went on to state that the Turbo should be kicking in close to my 
redline.  What is going on?  How can I get this performance 
diagnosed/cured?  Do I need a second opinion?  Any help/advice will be GREATLY 
appreciated.
