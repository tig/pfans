I have a 924 that spends a lot of garage time. (six kids)  I often find my
battery is low if not dead at the wrong time and am considering putting a
Schumaker low amp charger into the car.  It connects permantly to the
battery and you simply plug it in to keep the battery up.  This would be
especially usefull in the winter when the car sits for extended periods
without moving.  I am concerned however about possable alternator damage
from such a system.  It seems I once read that charging with the battery
connected would be harmfull to the charging system.  Anyone had any
experience with such a system?  Maybe Don Istook has a opinion on this?
