No, you will not fry the alarm unit by connecting the LED's. Your Alarm unit's 
current limiting resistor was chosen for 1 LED. Lets assume similar conditions 
to my previous note. Your alarm's R=(12-1.7)/0.01=1030=~1Kohms. You will be 
placing the Porsche factory LED's in series, so assuming the above conditions 
in your alarm ckts, you would be applying I=(12-3.4)/1000 = 8.6mA to 2 LED's. 
This may be enough to achieve adequate brightness. If you find that it is not 
enough brightness, you will need to make a simple modification. The alarm's 
current limiting resistor is either in the "brain", or in line with the wires 
leading to the LED which was included with the alarm. You would need to locate 
it, and replace the resistor with the appropriate value of resistance. Note, 
LED's are diodes and therefore do not light up unless the appropriate polarity 
is achieved. I also do not know if the factory Porsche LED's have a current 
limiting resistor within the wiring to it. Never connect an LED directly to a 
voltage source without limiting the current to it.

Have Fun,
  Ezra
