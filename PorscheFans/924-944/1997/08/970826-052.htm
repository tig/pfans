i know that at least 5 different times since i have been on this list, 1
year now, the wheel shimmy question comes up.  i now have FIRST hand
knowledge of the problem, i am no expert but here is what i have found.

wheel shimmy can be caused by

1) bad or bent tie rods to include the tie rod end.
2) bad ball joint in the control arms
3) bent rims
4) bad alignment to include mismatched tires and some brands of tire.
5) bad shocks
6) problems with the power steering
7) motor mounts.

you ask why i know, i have just recently replaced all of the above and
finally got the wheel shimmy to quit, of course now the trans. seems to be
bad.  i cant win!!!

i hope this help someone cuz i know it took me forever to find it.

matt
