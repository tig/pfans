Subject: Tire Question

Hello all,

I have a tire question:

I am trying to find new tires for my 1988 944 Turbo.

The last three sets of tires that I have used were:

Dunlop SP Sport 8000

Front: 225 50 ZR16
Rear: 245 45 ZR 16

And before that:

Dunlop SP Sport D40M2

Front: 205 55 ZR16
Rear: 255 50 ZR 16 (yes, they were big- but they did fit - sort of)

And, Originally:

Dunlop SP Sport D40M2 - I think, it was a long time ago.

Front: 205 55 ZR16
Rear: 225 50 ZR 16

My Rims are 7x16 front and 8x16 rear.
I want to retain the 'Plus Zero' sizing - 225 50 front and 245 45 rear.

Now I am considering one of these new 'Ultra High Performance All-Season'
tires.
I drive my car year round in Ohio.
Wet traction is very important to me.
I have looked at the Yokohama AVS S4  and the Pirrelli P7000 SuperSport.
I am looking to get some All Season capability but I want to know how much
Dry Handling I will sacrifice.
Any thoughts?

Has anyone tried one of these new tires? 
How do they compare with standard High Performance tires?

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Thomas Bapu
1988 944 Turbo - still running all year round!
