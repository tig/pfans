TO; Guy in Dayton looking for a cheap 924 or 944
FR: Rick (87 924S)

Have a friend that lives two hours from Dayton that has a 1983 944, red
with black interior, mechanically sound (would recommend a belt change
soon though), that's in pretty good shape.  He wants $3000.00 firm for
it.  I'd buy it myself, but I already have two sports cars.

Also, you may be hard pressed to find any 924's or 944's still running
in the $2500 price range.  Just aren't any that I have ever seen, unless
they are for parting out or the guy's dumping it because of divorce or
something.  You're going to have to at least double your price range to
get something decent.

Anyway, if you're interest in the 1983 944, mail me direct and I'll pass
the word to Roger.  If not, all I can say is happy hunting.

Regards, 
Rick (87 924S)
