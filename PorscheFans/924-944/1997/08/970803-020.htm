 How often do you find yourself on a racetrack with them? Call the local
 BMWCCA chapter, enter the next drivers ed event, and let us know how you
 did.

Got to agree with Paul on this one. One of my most startling experiences was
going down the back straight at Watkins Glen at about 135MPH, at full boost,
with my 89 Turbo S and being passed by a 4 door BMW sedan, It was an well
driven M5 and had 300 normally aspirated horsepower. I could catch him in the
corners but he pulled away on every straight. It was humbling to say the
least. We have BMW's come to out driving events all the time and some of them
could have your lunch. It's painful but face the reality.

Jerry
