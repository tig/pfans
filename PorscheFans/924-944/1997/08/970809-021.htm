Fans:

I've a quick question for some feedback from 944 owners. Time for the routine
oil change and I would like to give Mobil 1 a shot. ( Must be those clever
duelling banjo commercials!)  I normally run 20w 50 castrol. I like the added
weight to reduce oil comsumption and slight increase oil pressure. Is Mobile
1 available in a this weight? Any owners out there with any rpm increase or
any benefit to spending twice as much per quart? Would I just be pitching my
money in the trash? Thank you for the feedback.

Another odd question for you apartment dwellers out there.  I recently
relocated from a house with a wonderful garage to an apartment complex in
Denver CO. I used to do all my own maintenance thanks to PorscheFans and Jim
Pasha and now obviously there is no way to even lift my hood on my beloved
P-car without getting a foul look from new neighbors. ( I tend to agree with
them, you never know what sort of project might be undertaken by a shade tree
wanna-be in the middle of a parking lot!) The reason for my essay is a shock
from the local Porsche dealer asking $55 for a simple Castrol oil and filter
change. Any ideas or suggestions that maybe one of you did when presented
with this problem? Garage by the day rentals ect? 

Thanks  in advance.
