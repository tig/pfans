My U.S. version 968 came stock with 60/55 H4s in the headlamp locations. =
 I was surprised to see this as I was under the impression the H4s were =
not legal in the U.S.  I have just upgraded the 60/55s to 100/80 and =
also upgraded the H3 fogs to 100w and the H1 driving lights to 130w.  =
The lighting is incredible but I am careful to keep the alignment of the =
light correct.  I have also installed euro headlights in my Audi 4000 =
quattro with 130/90 H4s and 100 H1s and had not had a problem with =
anyone flashing their lights at me or law enforcement inquiring as to my =
lighting.

Gregor,

Fine point but the H4 lights are not legal here regardless of wattage, =
because
it is the lens which has the non-DOT approved pattern.
