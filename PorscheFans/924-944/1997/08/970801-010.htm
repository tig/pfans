Only if you promise to post some more of your Zen Master Mechanic meets
Turbo Stroker from Planet Nine stories!

Don't laugh, here is the way I did it:

What we are going to do is give the I/C a bath while in place. For this you
will need a NON-COMBUSTIBLE solvent (I use Simple Green) and an average size
wet/dry shop vac. Some solvents don't get along with aluminum all that well
so test for reaction on the outside of the I/C if you have any doubts. 

Start by pulling all the intake bits off each side of the intercooler. With the
bits off you will see that simply pouring water into the I/C will only let you
cover about 3/4 of the cross-feeds before the water will run out of the intake
and outlet. So you will have to become creative and use some of the removed
intake plumbing to raise the intake and outlet a little. The connections don't
have to be really secure just more or less water tight.

Mix up a 50/50 mix of the solvent and hot water. I think a gallon is enough.
Pour it into one of the extended I/C ports until all the cross-feeds are
covered. Let it soak for 10-15 minutes but don't let it get too cool sitting
there.

Empty the dirt out of the shop vac before the next step.

Take the shop vac and either duct tape or just hold your hand around the vac
hose and one of the I/C extensions. Turn the vac on. I was surprised when I
did it because there was this mighty gulp! and the I/C was completely empty.

Repeat the process as required and follow with 1 or 2 hot water rinses.
Remember to dump your vac and let the filter air dry or you won't want to use
it again.

Use a dental mirror and a flashlight to verify your results. Put the intake
plumbing back on and go for a drive.

Doug
