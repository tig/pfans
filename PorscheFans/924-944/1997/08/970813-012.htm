	I don't think that having two cars that will look very similar, and
from the front the same, is very wise. Porsche has used water cooling in
911s as far back as the '70s to facilitate the use of 4 valve heads in
their race cars. EU noise regulations have already killed a number of
sports cars. If they didn't change to water cooling there would be no
911s. I don't see the point of making the 911 a full 2+2 the sloping
roof dictates that anyone above 4 feet tall cant fit anyway. Hopefully
the water cooled engine will be able to be retrofitted to 'proper' 911s.
I don't think that the new engine can be called unproven, unless class
wins in GT1 at Le Mans aren't good enough for you. If my family owned
company turned over more than US$ 1 billion last year I would think that
the future was very rosey indeed.

        I'm afraid things aren't looking good for our favorite Auto
     manufacturer.  SNIP  Second, this new 911 looks like it will be a
huge
     disappointment.  The car is obviously an effort for Porsche to cut
     costs and consolidate assembly lines by building both the Boxter
and
     the 911 on the same platform.  The new car is larger in order to
     accommodate rear passengers.SNIP The styling on the new car is weak
at best, and has
     received vary lukewarm reviews. Further the adoption of an
unproven,
     water-cooled, boxster-based engine is yet another obvious
cost-cutting
     compromise. Nonetheless, I don't see Porsche's future looking
     very bright
