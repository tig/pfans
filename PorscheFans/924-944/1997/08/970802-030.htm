Jim,

The PS lines on all 944s, especially those on the S and the turbo,
get badly cooked by exhaust heat.   When they cook, they harden.
When they harden, they crack.   When these things happen it is
time to replace them.   Recommend you NOT try a workaround, 
since it will just come back to haunt you later.    Bite the bullet,
resolve your denial condition, and replace the hose with a nice
supple new one and never look back.
