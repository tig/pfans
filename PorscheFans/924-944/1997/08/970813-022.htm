     While I have no doubt that the new water-cooled engine is a great 
     piece of work, I am upset to see the end of the original air-cooled 
     911.  It's as if everyone had abandoned the small-block Chevy engine 
     and we had lost our roots.
        As for the aesthetic appearance of the new 911, I think it looks 
     like crap (I really wish I didn't have to rank on Porsche this much).  
     The Bosxter-style front will never grew on me, the rear needs that red 
     "PORSCHE" reflector panel, and the new 911 design just has a totally 
     different character than the old one.  It doesn't come across as a 
     evolution of the last 911, and people really can't associate it with 
     the 911 since it's such a new car--all it has in common is the 
     rear-engine theme.  It's as if the same people who designed the 
     Conquest to copy the 944 had somehow produced a poor kit-car 
     equivalent of the 911 too.  The 996 is to 993 just like the 
     2nd-generation RX-7 was to the 944.  The new 996 might as well have a 
     rotary engine!  It's a good thing Porsche is on good financial ground 
     now, because they sure are taking a risk by trying to perpetuate (even 
     if it's only indirectly) the 911 breed with both a new engine and new 
     body.  I bet people would accept the car more easily if less dramatic 
     differences were presented in the new model.  But, the 996 is already 
     here.  I just hope used 993 prices will be more appealing in a few 
     years...
     
     Ben (oh gosh, I'm starting to see the flames...  )

     I don't think that having two cars that will look very similar, and
from the front the same, is very wise. Porsche has used water cooling in 
911s as far back as the '70s to facilitate the use of 4 valve heads in 
their race cars. EU noise regulations have already killed a number of 
sports cars. If they didn't change to water cooling there would be no 
911s. I don't see the point of making the 911 a full 2+2 the sloping 
roof dictates that anyone above 4 feet tall cant fit anyway. Hopefully 
the water cooled engine will be able to be retrofitted to 'proper' 911s. 
I don't think that the new engine can be called unproven, unless class 
wins in GT1 at Le Mans aren't good enough for you. If my family owned 
company turned over more than US$ 1 billion last year I would think that 
the future was very rosey indeed.
     
Richard.

        I'm afraid things aren't looking good for our favorite Auto
     manufacturer.  SNIP  Second, this new 911 looks like it will be a
huge
     disappointment.  The car is obviously an effort for Porsche to cut 
     costs and consolidate assembly lines by building both the Boxter
and
     the 911 on the same platform.  The new car is larger in order to 
     accommodate rear passengers.SNIP The styling on the new car is weak
at best, and has
     received vary lukewarm reviews. Further the adoption of an
unproven,
     water-cooled, boxster-based engine is yet another obvious
cost-cutting
     compromise. Nonetheless, I don't see Porsche's future looking 
     very bright
