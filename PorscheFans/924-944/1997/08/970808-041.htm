P-Fans,

Want to thank all the 951 owners for the info on modifications to non-S
turbos.  This is evidently a popular topic of conversation.

Have a question for S2 owners about engine performance from 5500 to 6500
rpm.  My S2 engine seems to be in good shape. Great low end torque,
acceleration at specs, and it will get up to 145-150 mph at 7000 ft
altitude  (the 150 mph was with a slight tail wind). But it seems to be a
little slow to redline on gears 3-5.  I could swear that my late 85 was
quicker to the rev limiter in 3rd and 4th gears.  Has anyone else noticed
this? I was thinking that a modification of the stock cams might yield
better revving at the top of the tach. Anyone talked w/ WebCam or some
other outfit about "cammier" cam profiles?  Or is this simply a
characteristic of the longer stroke used in the 3 liter engine?

Thanks.

-- Nick
