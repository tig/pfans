Wow.  OK, I stand corrected.  I have seen some references from the list 
long ago (and possibly from the old Porschephiles list) that the limit 
was 45K, despite the factory statement of 60k being the limit (1989).

Are these factory belts that are failing prematurely, or aftermarket?  
Were they properly tensioned with the gauge?  Do failed/seized rollers or 
water pumps contribute to the belt failures you have seen?

The owner of the shop I go to states the Porsche belts now use Kevlar as 
part of their composition, making them more durable.

BTW, your input is appreciated.. it is nice to have shop owners on the 
list who can give input based on the cars they see and repair on a daily 
basis.
