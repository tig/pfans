Hello all,
I am new to the list and am the proud new owner of a 1987 951 in pristine
condition.  I have a few questions that I am hoping some of you could
answer for me:
1. What size are the front and rear brakes and how many pistons are on
each.  I was told by a mechanic that he thought they were 4 piston f+r but
was not sure.

2. I need the new metal gears for the sunroof and the hand painted porsche
tire inflation caps; does anyone know where the cheapest place to buy them
is?

3. What is the stock boost and what is the maximum safe amount I can turn
it up to without changing anything stock?

Thanks for any help.  

Andrew
