>N.O.P.I. out of Atlanta, Ga offers a Sanden Air Condition Update Kit for=

the 85.5
and later 944 cars for about $400.00.  The salesman told me that this uni=
t
is 30%
more efficient than the stock unit.  This kit comes complete with all new=

hardware
(compressor, clutch, brackets, hoses, fittings, etc...) needed to make th=
is
an easy
conversion. Does anybody have experience with this kit?  Is this a good
choice over
a rebuilt stock unit?
<

We just installed a Sanden on our S2.  Our compressor was toast so it was=

unacceptable as a core on a rebuilt unit.  The plus side:  It will freeze=

your nose and no core is required.  Minus side:  Our kit was purchased fr=
om
Griffiths for $349 and was not a direct bolt on.  Two of the mounting ear=
s
on the compressor had to be cut off with a hacksaw.  They did mark the on=
es
to be cut.  There was no R134A filler valve in the kit.  Our local A/C ma=
n
evacuated the system.  The compressor, high pressure hose, belt and dryer=

was installed by my partener.  The A/C man made a hose with a fitting and=

charged the system for $160.

Let us know if the NOPI kit has all the required parts.
