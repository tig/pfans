Check your slave cylinder...Look through the inspection hole at the
release arm where the clutch slave cylinder contacts the arm.  There
should be 15 to 18 mm of travel of the clutch arm.  There should be
..05mm clearance between the clutch master cylinder piston and the
push-rod from the pedal.  

A weak slave will cause a problem where the pedal will not pop back up.
The master cylinders will usually leak when they are going bad.

Let me know...Don Istook
