Be sure of your technical information before you make a post to the
list.  A 951 wastegate does not open by vacuum, but by boost pressure.

The line going to the wastegate ultimately comes off of the intake
manifold.  If you are building up boost in the intake manifold, you have
no vacuum, but pressure.  This pressure will overcome the spring seat
pressure in the valve of the wastgeate.  When you adjust the boost by
means of an adjustable boost knob, you are actually restricting the
pressure going to the wastegate, alllowing the valve to stay closed.

On older 930 turbos, we used to shim up the spring in the wastegate so
if would stay closed longer.  On that style, the adjustable boost knob
would add additional pressure to he wastegate diaphram, counteracting
the exhaust pressure trying to open the valve.  I don't remember what we
did with 924 Carrera GTR's or 924 turbos.

Just wanted to correct a post with misleading information.
