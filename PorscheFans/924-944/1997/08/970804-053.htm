You can't jam radar.  Car and Driver did a test with all the available
jammers and they just don't work.  Some were able to keep the gun from
getting a reading, but the officer can still tell what's up.  The problem is
you're not allowed to broadcast.  

Laser is a different story.  Again I site car and driver.  They did a
test/comparison w/ all the laser evading technology.  I can't remembeer the
name of the device, but it worked.  Even on the front of a giant Cady (but
they had to use two!)  Basically just blasts out laser light and blinds the
gun.  Interesting side note, they used a Firebird and a cadillac as the test
vehicles.  Withough a license plate, the Firebird is invisible to LIDAR from
the front.
