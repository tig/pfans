A little background on the issue.   I had the car for a couple of weeks =
and it fired every time on the first turn of the key and under 4-6 =
revolutions of the crank.   I left for vacation and I removed the =
ignition relay to prevent it being started.  (1. being stolen  2. =
teenager at home while we were gone).  When I returned, I replaced the =
sparkplugs with a new set of Bosch's (WR5DC's) because they looked a =
little worn and I thought were the wrong ones (WR7DC) for the car.  =
Hoping to cure a sometimes misfire on idle.=20

After replacing the plugs, it was then I noticed that it was hard to =
start.  Thinking it was because I had let it sit for 7-8 days and hadn't =
started it before changing, I didn't think much of it.  It never got any =
better.
  =20
After thinking about it and the possibility of disconnecting power to =
the Injection control unit, I figured I needed to run it for a while ( =
30 Min ) and remap the unit.   Still happening. =20

At this point, being confused, I was going through the service slips =
from the dealer, the previous owner had done and noticed that he had a =
problem with cold starting also.  The cure that time was a mis-fitting =
o-ring seal under the oil filler cap.  (Don't know if it solved it or =
not, but the tech that did it, did offer up that errant vacuum leak can =
be a serious problem with the DME system when I called and talked to him =
the other day.)  I checked for leaks. Notta

The car starts fine when warm.  Plugs seemed a little fouled when I =
removed them again and check to see what was happening.  A little =
puzzled at this point.   I am going to check the battery for a load test =
to see if it may be an issue.  I've checked around to see if I maybe =
pulled a hose loose while changing the plugs or looking at the condition =
of the Air filter ( That's a joy to check).  I have ordered a set of =
manuals but not received them yet. (UPS Yours, teamsters).  Is there a =
temp sensor on the block, and if so what's the Ohm measurements at cold =
and warm if anyone knows? =20

 Any help or feedback would be appreciated.  =20

Thanks, Mike Mullins
