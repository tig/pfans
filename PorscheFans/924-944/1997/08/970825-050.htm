That CLUNK I heard in my 86 951 might be the clutch.  I contacted the dealer
in Madison, WI and was quoted a price of $2,000 for the whole operation
(factory parts, etc...)

It turns out that it was the half-shaft that snapped.  $650 for the repairs.
Much cheaper.  Thanks to all that responded.





18 hours?!  Geez.  If I go to the dealership, @ $89/hr, that means labor
*alone* will run me $1,600!  I guess, I somehow knew there was a reason
why I should be treating this car with extra care ;-)..  So, is my math
correct in assuming that a clutch in parts will run me another $800 and
I'll be out of pocket $2,400 by the time I'm all set and done?

Cheers,
Chris
