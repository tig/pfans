Hi all,

Its winter in Melbourne at the moment and although not as harsh as in
Nth America or Europe the Roads are like lakes. Can anyone tell me the
proceedure of adjusting the rear Torsion bar of my 968CS.

Currently the Bar is set to the middle of the three holes of its
attachment point. The Rear is still too stiff however for Wet Road
Driving and Oversteer is in abundance.

Is it better to unbolt the torsion bar with the car under its own
weight, ie on driving ramps or do I have to Raise the Rear Wheel off the
ground. ( This would seem to be increasing the load on the torsion bar
).

Any Suggestions would be gladly accepted.

Regards

Glenn
