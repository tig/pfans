Linen refers to the color of the leather. I have a met blk 951 with
linen leather and polished wheels. As you can imagine keeping it clean
is almost as much fun as being audited. I used Mother's leather cleaner
to get the grime off, and Hide Food for the conditioning. Hide Food is
excellent and it will keep your leather in top shape.

The interior of my S2 CAB is starting to look a little dirty and worn. I
believe the material is "Linen" but I'm not sure it this just relates to
the color (cream) or the actual material. I always thought the seats
were leather, but the texture feels a little different. Does anyone know
what kind of interior these cars came with and what is the best way to
clean and protect it? A mechanic once suggested that I use hand-cleaner
for interior in order to get out all the dirt. Would this be a good or a
bad thing to do? The car gets driven a lot and the seats are hence
exposed to a lot of sunshine and a lot of dust so I would like to find
the best way to clean and preserve them.
