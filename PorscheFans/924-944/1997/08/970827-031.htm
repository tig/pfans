I discovered today that my sunroof raising mechanism has a broken cable. 
The break is within one of the lift arm 'gearboxes' (the black things that
actually lift up the aft portion of the roof protrude from these boxes). 
So the roof still goes up and down but is held in place by only one arm
resulting in the other corner lifting up about 1/2 inch at 75 - 80 mph.  I
read the (factory) shop manual section on this carefully and was horrified
to learn that the WHOLE ASSEMBLY must be replaced.  I take it to mean these
cables are not sold separately and my wallet is already having palpitations
(assuming it can still be purchased at the dealer).  Has anyone out there
figured a way to replace or otherwise repair a broken cable?  Has anyone
had luck buying a used assembly?
