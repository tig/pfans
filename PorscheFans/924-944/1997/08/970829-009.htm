The 2.8 is like the 2.5 with the crankschaft from the 3.0l. (excelence
8-97).
I have read some tests with the 968 Turbo and see it in Weisach, and I
dont think it is like a V 8. It was faster than the 3.8 RSR and 0-125
mph was about 10 sec faster than the 87 951. the 2.8 will be the "same"
8 valve 968 turbo engine with
0.2 l less engine capacity.
