Try this......
this seems to have happened to everyone - wonder why ??   Here are the
annotated instructions........why the Porsche garage would say expensive is
 beyond me - for anyone who's done it before it shouldn't take more than 10
 minutes or so.  Good luck.......

Here are some instructions I received from another list member (debequem @
rcinet.com - Thanks Marv) - having done the job at the weekend I've added
some bits to the instructions.........

Yes, there is a light in the rear of the clock module.  You can remove the
clock by first taking the center console face plate (very careful!) by
removing the two slider knobs and leaving the round knobs on. (THIS PLATE
IS HELD ON BY BEING CLIPPED OVER LUGS ON THE PLASTIC PLATE BEHIND IT
(AROUND THE EDGES).

The plastic plates are very thin!!! (YES - DO NOT BEND ANY OF THEM MORE
THAN ABOUT TEN DEGREES - USE A THIN POINT/SCREWDRIVER TO GET BEHIND THEM AT
 THE POINT OF ANY RESISTANCE.

Open the passenger door and remove the screws (ONLY ONE ON MINE) on the
black triangle plastic plate on the dash side.

Remove the small round plastic air vent with a small coin (OR LARGE
SCREWDRIVER) (turn anticlockwise - QTR TURN UNTIL IT COMES LOOSE).

Using a small flat screwdriver, remove the rectangular plastic cover plate
next to the passenger side vent by prying it free.

All screws should now be exposed to remove the plastic plate that covers
the clock.  Actually the clock is screwed to the back of this plate.

Use a long flat pry bar and very carefully pry this plastic off.  All the
plastic plates will snap very easily.

The bulb screws into the back of the clock with a 1/4 turn.  Porsche only
part. (YEAH, I GOT MINE FROM A PORSCHE SHOP BUT IT WAS STAMPED OSRAM....)

WHEN YOU TAKE THE LONG PLATE OFF, THE AUTO A/c TEMP SENSING TUBE MAY COME
OFF THE BACK OF IT (IT DID ON MINE)
IF SO, YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE THE GLOVE BOX OFF TO REFIT (MINE
DOESN'T STAY ON NOW, SO I'M LOOKING FOR A CLIP TO HOLD IT).

Good luck - if you have any questions, give me a call (it's great to
actually be able to see the clock though !).
