In a message dated 97-08-12 11:57:08 EDT, you write:

<< I have two general questions regarding my '86 944T.  The first one is
about
 the brakes.  I have read the the 951's have four piston calipers.  Is this
 true?  Also, I have noticed that the brakes on my car require different
 parts (rotors, etc) than the '87 and on models.  Does anyone know the
 difference between the braking systems? >>

Yes, the 951s have 4 piston calipers.  Between '86 and '87, Porsche changed
the configuration of the rotor/hub assembly.  If I recall correctly, on the
earlier cars the rotor mounted to the "backside" of the hub flange; on the
later, to the "outside."
I believe this was done in conjunction with making ABS available as an
option, and may also have been accompanied by a change in the wheel bearings.
 This also accounts for the difference in wheel offset/backspace between the
two years. I think the 944 FAQ has more on the topic.
 
<< The second question concerns Autothority Stage II chips.  Does anyone know
 if the chips sold by Europroducts in Excellence and Panorama that are
 called Stage II chips for $199 are the same as the Autothority Stage II
 chips sold elsewhere for several hundred more? >>

I doubt that they're the same, but give Europroducts a call and I'm sure
they'll tell you all about them. The Europroducts chips may not be approved
for street use, and that would account, at least in part, for their lower
price (the EPA approval process is probably not cheap).  I bought one of
their chips for my NA 944, and it was labelled "for off-road use only"  (they
were upfront about it when I placed my order).  However,
since I was putting it in a track car, that was not an issue for me.  In
fact, it was a bonus, since there seemed to be more of an improvement over
the stock chip than others have apparently experienced with "street-legal"
aftermarket chips for NA cars--
not surprising given that it's probably easier to reprogram the DME chip for
increased performance if you don't also have to worry about meeting emissions
requirements. 
Drivability was excellent as well.
I'm not sure that's as much of an issue for a 951, since most of the
performance increase is coming from the boost (KLR?) chip, rather than the
DME chip.  
I now have the Autothority Stage II in my '88 951 S street car, and I'm very
happy with it.
