Hi all,

I am experiencing the classic glass/metal trim seperation on my rear 
hatch. I remember a post a while back detailing the fix and the proper 
glue that should be used for this repair?
Also I am replacing the rear hatch rubber gasket seal (the large one) any 
advice on this?
TIA

Mike Kehr

     You mean you guys didn't think it was cool when Chevy Cavaliers came 
     out with groovy "FI" badging (for fuel injected! WHOA!)?
     
     On a sort of tangent:  I've noticed that many 80's turbocharged cars 
     have the "TURBO" script in the same (or similar) font and style as the 
     Porsche "TURBO" script used on either the 930's or 951's.  I 
     understand that Porsche had the phrase trademarked for a time (in 
     applications involving car badging I suppose), and I was wondering if 
     that could explain the simlarities in badge/decal appearance.  I 
     believe that these other car manufacturers had to ask permission 
     before using the term "turbo" on their own cars, it would only make 
     sense that Porsche would require these manufactures to employ the 
     "Porsche font" so that people could associate the term with the 
     Porsche marque.  Or were all these cars just trying to emulate the 
     Porsches to an excessive degree?  I've even seen Chrysler minivans 
     with the "TURBO" script and I could almost swear that they had 
     actually used 931 decals!
     
     Ben

I guess Porsche thought it was cool in the way some 911s have the Carrera 
or Porsche script along the side of the car.  I am not sure which is more 
presumptious.  Of course, the best has to be the BMW option on the 2002 
which had the script printed in a mirror-image on the front spoiler so 
that you could read it on the rear-view mirror when the car was pulling up 
behind you! (as in ecnalubma).
