Steve,

The dust cap should be pried off in one of two ways.  The first is to =
work around its circumference with a pry bar, working it up a little at =
time.  The other way is to position two pry bars 180 degrees out and pop =
it straight out.

With regard to removing races, warming the hub is certainly not a bad =
idea.  I generally use a propane torch for this sort of thing, handy and =
effective.  The head costs about $30, the cylinders are like $2 and last =
a good long while.  Buy a good set of brass drifts (Snap On makes a nice =
kit of three), and use them to work the races out.  Tap at 180 degrees =
off, or 90 degree offsets, to work each race evenly out.  Slow and =
steady wins the race - er, sorry about the pun.  You can do this cold, =
you don't absolutely need to warm the hub.

It is important that your deburr the hub of any little gouges you give =
it when removing the races.  A small, moon-shaped file is the trick =
here.
