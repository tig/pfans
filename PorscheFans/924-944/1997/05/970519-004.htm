Steve,
      When I bought my '86 944 last fall, it had 225 50 15'2 on it. I
have replaced the front set, and stuck with the same size. The drawbacks
to using this size tire:
o They are not a common size, so will usually have to be special order
o Your Speedometer will read high, and your milage will accumulate
quicker than actual.(I plan to make a ckt to correct for this, but
probably will not get to it for several months still.)
o Will track on uneven roads more than stock 

Benefits are:
o Looks better
o Better low end acceleration
o Better handling due to lower profile and larger width

If you can live with the above, go for it!

Good luck,
          Ezra
