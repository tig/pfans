I am not all that familiar with the differences between the interiors of your
944S2 and my '87 944S, however I will share my experiences in replacing my
rear speakers. It has been quite a while since I changed them and I sold the
old speakers so I am not sure of the factory sizes. I do not believe they are
4x6 though. Seems to me they were a round speaker about 4 or 5 inches in
diameter. You said you did not want to do any sheet metal cutting and I don't
blame you for that. It is quite a hastle. I installed a 5 inch midbass and a
1 inch tweeter on each side in the rear of my Porsche. The tweeters were
recessed directly into the upholstry side panels (holes cut in them) and
sheet metal cut out from behind  the upholstry for clearance. I fabricated a
piece of thin plywood on which I mounted the 5 inch speakers and the
crossovers (these were component speakers Soundstream brand ) were mounted on
back of the plywood. The whole reason for the "custom" plywood on which to
mount the 5 inch speakers is so the speakers will line up properly behind the
preformed speaker grill (holes punched out in the upholstry side panels) . I
didn't want to punch more holes in the side panel in order to let the sound
come out. I also didn't want an ugly external speaker grill back there along
side the holes that were already provided by Porsche. My installation kept
the panels original with only the addition of a pair of recessed tweeters.
Now that you've waded through all that, I'll let you know how  I delt with
the window back there when I removed the side panels. I simply lifted (
gently pryed ) the rubber gasket up enough to slip the panel and upholstry
material out from behind it. Extreme caution may be in order as the rubber
may have deteriated over the years. The window was no problem for me at all,
but as I said I don't know if there is a difference in our upholstry's. I
definately did not remove the glass.  Please exercise extreme caution if any
sheet metal is cut from the inside of your vehicle. There is little clearance
between the inside you're cutting and the outside of your beautiful fender. A
saber saw will peck holes in the fender from the inside out if you're not
very careful. Hope this helps you some.
