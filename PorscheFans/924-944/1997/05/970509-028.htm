Last night I adjusted my clutch pedal as described in the Haynes manual (BTW,
this manual is pretty bad). My clutch pedal was really bad, I had about 20mm of
free play rather than the 3mm specified.

Well, I adjusted the free play down to the 3mm. This was pretty easy once I got
the hand of lying upside down under the pedals! The problem is the spring. I
don't quite understand what I am trying to measure. The Haynes manual states
that the spring should be 61mm from the bearing to the plate. Is the plate the
piece of metal that the spring is pressing against?

I am also assuming that the 3mm of play and the 61mm for the spring are correct
for my 944 S (87) model. I am going to buy one of those spec books. Meanwhile I
don't want to damage my clutch. Actually, the clutch is much, much better. I
don't really know why the workshop didn't adjust this when putting in the new
clutch. Since making this adjustment the clutch seems to release better. (Maybe
its just my feet, which are close to BOZO size!).

If you have some free play on your clutch pedal. This is about a 30 minute job.
All you need is a 13mm spanner and a torch.

Robert.
