Hey ya'll....

Just to add my thoughts to the ongoing chipping thread, one thing that =
most folks are failing to mention is the added driveability you get with =
the chips.  I do most of my driving on the street at or below the posted =
speed limit, so doing 150 MPH isn't an issue for me.  When I first got =
my '87 951 it was really fast, but the turbo lag made it feel like a =
'digital' car - you either got the incredible rush of power when you =
floored it or you lugged the engine when driving in city traffic.  With =
the chip (in my case Weltmeister), the car's torque curve feels much =
more V-8 like with the boost coming on IMMEDIATELY(at least the boost =
gauge says so).  The turbo boost rush is still there when you floor it, =
but not as pronounced as before.

So for me, the driveability is the feature I like best about the chip =
change, not necessarily the extra 30 or so HP.  Reliability wise, I have =
had no problems yet after a year of use and 6000 miles on the chip.  =
Most of the 944 Turbo engine builders/racers (Chris Cervelli, etc.) seem =
to feel that keeping the boost below 1.1 bar is OK for engine longevity, =
as long as the fuel mapping keeps the mixture nice and rich at the =
higher boost levels.  Since the DME drives the stock boost gauge though, =
the REAL boost can only be determined with a seperate gauge.  You  have =
to trust that the software coders were honest in how they drive the =
boost gauge ( and that the stock pressure transducer on the KLR unit is =
still good after 7-10 years! ).  Of course, it could all be more =
psychological than I realize.  It should be really easy to 'enhance' the =
boost gauge's behavior to make you think all that boost is coming on =
right away.  Hmmm.... maybe I should have done a hex dump of those PROMs =
before I installed them...

Of course, most 951 driver's may drive the car floored all the time and =
like the stock DME mapping.  I, on the other hand, need to drive slowly =
sometimes!  My point is I enjoy my car much more now, even though I =
don't used the peak power as much as I would like to.  Given what I now =
know, would I chip the car again?  As we say in Georgia - 'Has a cat got =
a climbin' gear?'.  Hell yes!

BTW, I think that chipping a NA 944 is probably not worth the effort or =
money.  You're not getting much bang for the buck and the work involved.

P.S.  If it weren't for two things - Porsche's PPE program and the =
Porsche Fan's list - this car would have been long gone from my garage.  =
Thanks Porsche USA for making these cars affordable (relatively) to =
maintain with real Porsche parts.  And double thanks to ya'll =
PorscheFans who have so eagerly responded to my questions of the past.  =
This list is an invaluable asset to us owners.
