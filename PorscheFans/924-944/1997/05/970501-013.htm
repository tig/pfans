Friends: A little tip from your Uncle Tony, here in spectcular NYC, regarding
that 
DE-scusting original equiptment hood insulaton stuff.

I ordered the replacement panels from AUTOMOTION. You can get them
pre-cut...ready to peel and stick. (You can also get it for 20 bucks less, if
you want to cut it yourself....but for 20 bucks...why?)

DO NOT try and take off the old stuff at home!!! It's quite messy and gets
all over your nice clean motor. (I made this mistake so you won't have to...)
Go to a local carwash...or anyplace that has a vaccum system. THE best way to
proceed is to actually SCRAPE the old stuff off with the vaccum nozzle. It
sucks (in a good way...) all the dust and loose pieces....keeping them from
your engine compartment. 

After it's all off, simply peel the backing off of the new panels...and
Voila!  (pr: wa-la!)
you're rocking with a solid insulation once again. Total cost $89.00 plus 15
minutes.

Plus...the cockpit is much more quiet. (I was surprised, actually...it does
make a difference.)

Well...there you have it! Good luck.
