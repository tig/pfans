Fellow Wrench Heads:
   Another piece of invaluable info from your Uncle Tony in Manhattan:

   On my 86 944, (33K, really!) the timing belt had been replaced right
before I purchased the car. 

   I noticed a knocking sound coming from the front of the engine, where the
timing belt is located. I was told that the belt was new...and I didn't think
that anyone in their right mind would change a timing belt without changing
the tensioner...but guess what???  I was wronger than Hillary in White Water!

   Fixed the tensioner...AND made sure that the timing belt was at the PROPER
tension...and it runs like a different monster...WITHOUT the knock!

   So...ifin you hear such a vomit producing sound coming from that
particular region of your motor....Chances are it's that!

   I'd love to (have one date with Pamela Anderson) hear from anybody else
who has experienced a similar situation.

Tony A.
