Hi all,

I have a recently purchased a 968 Club Sport, to which the previous
owner opted for the Radio Option that consisted of just front Speakers.
The Rear Speaker locations are behind the seat belt mounting panel
however they seem to be a unsual shape, not just your 4x6 as in the
front door panels. My guess is that it is a combination 5 1/2 inch low
range speaker and high range side by side. 

Is this common to the previous S2, or just the 968. Unfortunately 968's
are not around any of the local dealers for me to view; and the local
dealer's pricings are high.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.


Regards

Glenn Davis
