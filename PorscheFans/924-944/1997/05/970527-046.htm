My cam chain tensioner for my '87 944S arrived today and I immediately
installed it on the car. After 153000mi. of wear it was none too soon. The
"fiber" friction material that the chain runs on had wear grooves cut into
it, but, the "friction pad "was cracked for about two thirds the width of the
pad and was ready to fail at any moment I'm sure. It appears to me that the
"friction pads" are made to be replaced because the top one slides off and
the bottom one has two screws that attach it to the tensioner. Part numbers
stamped in the material are 928.105.509.01 (top pad) and 928.105.347.01
(bottom pad). Wish I'de have known that before I purchased the entire chain
tensioner  ($231.00 at Carlsen Motor Cars, Phone(415) 856-6300, Fax
(415)856-0648 or 1-800-523-2408. The hydraulic part of my old tensioner
seemed to have plenty of tension still to it and I may have only had to
replace the "friction pads". If the pads can be replaced and someone wants my
old tensioner cheap drop me a line. By the way, I did  not replace the oil
feed tube because my local dealer gave me a "J Shaped" tube and mine was more
of a straight tube with a slight bend in it. Checked my old tube carefully
and it seemed ok.
