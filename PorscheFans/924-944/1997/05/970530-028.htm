I meant to create the web site as I did the work. Well, that sure sounded
like a good idea at the time, but the reality is that I did not have the
time at the time. I'm back on the case.

You can see my (incomplete) efforts at:

http://www.mindspring.com/~design/thefuture/

I still need to author two major sections "Born Again Wrench" and "Oh,
you're going to Sebring," but the shell is up, and two of the four major
sections are up and running. You can contribute!

Let me know about your dealings with the people who sell us the parts.

Who's behind the e-mail addresses? Let's see owners and their cars!

+ + +

http://www.mindspring.com/~design/thefuture/links/

Buddy, can you spare a link?

Lemme know what you think. My goal is to turn this into a site where we can
send Certified Shadetree Mechanics (CSM) for some of the more routine
maintanance issues we owners face. Belts, oil-cooler seals, brakes, etc.

To keep it within the realm of my knowledge, this site will focus on stock
normally aspirated 944's. I don't know nothing bout no turbo's and I don't
race... yet, on both counts. In time.

Thanks, go list...
