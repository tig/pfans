RE: Police DUI checkpoint scenario

Though officers have a duty and obligation to enforce the law, they are
also required to do so in a polite and courteous fashion.  Unless of
course, you're being an arguementative wanker and/or the situation
dictates a different response.  Then you will tend to reap what you sow,
since most officers deal with brainless and aggressive morons day in and
day out.

However, I am very surprised that the officer, upon seeing that you were
obviously sober, just didn't wave you through the checkpoint.  In my
opinion there was no justifiable reason for him to give you the hard
time that he did.  Understandably he may have had a bad day, or was a
new rookie (rookies tend to be a little too gung ho when they're fresh
out of the academy), etc, but there still no excuse for the treatment
you received.  If he's going to give you a ticket, or just give a
warning, or is arresting you he/she should do so in a professional
manner.  Bottom line is that whether its a patrolman or the Chief, they
simply can't do whatever the hell they want.  They also have someone to
answer to for being either out of line or making mistakes.

Anytime, that anybody feels that an officer is really out of line...you
as a member of the taxpaying public have a responsibility to report that
behaviour or actions to that officers supervisor or even his Chief.  If
you feel strongly enough about something and you are not getting any
satisfaction with the police brass...then call City Hall.  Just my $.02.
