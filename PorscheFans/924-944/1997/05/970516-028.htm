<<This is great if you can find someone who'll do it for free. If not,
you can buy the glue yourself at any autopart store (esp. the larger
chain/supermarket type stores like Western Auto). The glue is
specifically for rear view mirrors. Just scrape the old glue off w/ a
razorblade, prep both surfaces with an alcohol swab, and glue merrily. I
did this on my parent's minivan, and the repair lasted for years until
they traded the thing in.>>

Plain-ole cyanoacrylic (sp?) epoxy works very well, too. The last time
mine fell off was just before a driver's ed event at Lime Rock and I
borrowed some glue from the Skip Barber mechanics working on the school
cars. I kept expecting it to fall off and ruin my weekend, but it stayed
secure ever since.

I also found that the hinge gets rather hard and any sort of adjustment
makes it come right off. I played with the joint for awhile and got it
to turn much more freely before reattaching.

All in all it came off with the standard windshield epoxy 4 times over a
10 year period with 2 of the occurances due to other drivers not
realizing how fragile it was.
