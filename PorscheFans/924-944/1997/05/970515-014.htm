MD> Just what is prudent?  I have lived in the South East section of
MD> Pennsylvania and witnessed the same behavior.
MD>
MD> Here in Dayton there are roads where the same phenomena takes place.
MD> Those
MD> roads have varying "public" speed limits.  Rush hour is by far the
MD> fastest.
MD> Later at night, it settles down to speeds closer to those posted.
MD>
MD> This is exactly opposite of what would be "prudent" judgement, but
MD> that's
MD> the psychology.  I have tracked along one Minivan traveling at 93 mph
MD> while
MD> carrying on with a cell phone conversation.  Clearly this is
MD> ridiculous.  I
MD> am driving a car that runs rings around the Minivans in every way, yet
MD> I
MD> know that rush hour is not the time for high speed.  This gentleman was
MD> traveling 20 mph faster than I am comfortable with on that road.  My
MD> comfort level is not dictated so much by my car, but those around me.
MD> It
MD> makes me wonder if my vehicle has a particular performance envelope,
MD> how
MD> can some one push a vehicle with an inferior envelope so much faster?
MD>
MD> The really sick part of this is that this is not really a self
MD> correcting
MD> problem.  That is, stupid people do get killed, but fate favors that
MD> incident long after they have successfully breeded and made their
MD> contributions to the gene pool.  Go figure.

***** NOTES from Moore, Roger (Rog @ Optelecom.OPTC) at 5/15/97 9:13 AM


Marv,

I see the same thing around here: haulin' ass at rush hour, slowing down
at night. I think the only reason people slow down in the evening is
because there are less cars on the road then. That makes you an easier
target for police. That's my mentality anyway, since all my speeding
tickets have come at night when I was the only car out there. Live and
learn.

I also can't believe it when I'm goin' 80mph and an '86 Dodge Caravan
blows past me. Let's just hope they don't have to change lanes too fast.
They are pushing their envelope. Hopefully I'll be able to get around the
flaming wreckage!

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
