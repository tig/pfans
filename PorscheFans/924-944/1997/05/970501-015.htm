>Not an uncommon problem at all.  First, do a good cleaning job on the
>latches, as they do get filled up with old grease, dirt, etc.  Next, apply
>some white lithium grease on the latch parts and open and close them
>several times with the key to make sure the grease gets to all the areas.
>Then close the hatch and check for proper operation.  If it still doesn't

>it catches the hatch properly.  To adjust, loosen the hexnut and then turn
>the ball in or out and re-tighten the hex nut to lock it into place.
