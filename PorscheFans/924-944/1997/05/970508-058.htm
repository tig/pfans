Hi there,

I am experiencing the same problem with my 84' 944 (But it isn't Alpine White
- It's Black).  

I too would like to know how to remedy this ANNOYING problem.  I am the only
one who can open mine with one hand so my girlfriend _forces_ me to be a
gentleman (when we use my car)  and my buddies must be wimps....   Not to
mention how annoying it is when both hands are full and you need to put
something on the passenger seat.

One good thing though,  often passengers/friends don't lock the passenger
door because they think it has central locking  - yet the car has remained
untouched (And I live in Chicago too)  as the lock appears jammed - unless
you know about it.
