                I bit the bullet and decided to try the "Wet Okole" seat
covers found in Performance Products catalog to cover up the deteriorating
cloth inserts on the 87 944S previously owned by a firefighter who must have
sat in the car after fighting one too many toxic blazes.  I got black with
red to match my red with black interior.  They look GREAT!!; they feel fine,
and they fit snug (i did remove both seats to assure fit). 

                HOWEVER, anyone considering them should be advised that the
company put their f----'n logo on the prominently on the headrest which, in
my opinion, really is tacky.  I have sent them my complaint, and requested
plaint black covers for the headrest, and will advise as to how cooperative
they may be.
