It looks like I struck a chord (or a nerve) with a lot of pressurized Porsche
lovers.  Compared to Farzaan's numbers (16-18 psi), I'm not running much
boost, but compared to what I was running - I'm loving these chips.  Maybe
the difference is the outlet valve on the "S" version turbo.

Ray wondered why he wasn't getting over 1.2 bar.  I know why - I'll bet!  I
learned this by accident.  While unhooking the vaccuum line that runs from
the intake manifold to the KLR box, (for the purpose of "tapping in" for my
VDO guage) I removed a two-wire connector from a small cylindrical object
mounted below the intake manifold.  The wires were in a "T" connection.  Made
my hook up, fired up the car and took off out of the driveway.  I punched it
(the car was already warm) and was totally underwhelmed.  Couldn't get more
than 1.2 bar.  These car's aren't that quick at 1.2 bar.

Long story short, I'd forgotten to reconnect the wires on that cylindrical
piece (looks like some sort of solenoid, maybe).  Hooked the wires back up -
greased lightning!  Check your wires, Ray, and if they're hooked up, I bet
its the cylindrical part malfunctioning.

This brings me to the last point.  It's embarrasing to keep referring to this
"cylindrical part", and ask questions about banjo bolts increasing - or not
increasing boost.  This stems from the fact that this is my first turbo - and
beyond the basic understanding of wastegate, turbo, more air/fuel, more
horsies, etc., I don't understand the complete system.  Can anyone recommend
a good book or manual on the subject?  I need to understand what's going on
with KLR controls, shimming wastegates, re-cycling valves, etc.  I'd like to
find something between Haynes 944 na (no turbo stuff) and the Porsche Service
Manual (won't spend the money).  Any recommendations?

Last thing, I still want to know why I get the same boost (about .8-.9
absolute bar) whether I have the stock banjo bolt (no restriction) or the
Autothority with a restricted orifice.  Any ideas?
