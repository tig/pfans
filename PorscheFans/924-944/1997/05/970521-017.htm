I apologize if I seemed overeager or even paranoid that I was possibly flaming
other people.  After your last message I see that you know what you are doing
quite well.  Indeed my 944S with D40M2s, stock springs/torsion bar and 21.5/18m
f/r sway bars leaned in the turns on the Missouri backroads to the point
that I was about to start looking into more upgrades. The car had already been
leveled (the rear was a bit elevated when I bought it), so I was starting to
look for other upgrades.

			Menelaos N. Karamichalis
			Ex 944S owner, hope to own another 944 variant soon.
