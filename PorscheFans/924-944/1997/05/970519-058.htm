The top one is supposed to regulate the amount of air/heat going to the
windshield, and the bottom one regulates the amount of air going to your
feet.  By sliding both levers to the CLOSED position (left), you limit
airflow to the dash vents that directly face you (2 by door and 2 above
climate control console).  At low fan speeds, you probably wouldn't notice a
difference, but you should feel differences in the force of the blast while
sliding the lever at anything over fan speed 2.  In the winter, I usually
have both levers OPEN so that my feet stay warm and my windshield stays
clear.  In the summer, I close both so that I can maximize the force of the
AC to my face and body.

I think you may be referring to the rear windshield-wiper button.  It's
symbol looks like a wiper blade sweeping across an arc, so I can see how it
might look like a flag.  If you don't have the rear wiper, it makes sense
that nothing happens when you toggle the button.  But I'm surprised that
Porsche left the button there for an absent option.  I guess your rear-wiper
doesn't work if you DO have one.  I can't think of any other button that may
be described to have a "flag symbol" on it, but I may be missing something
even more obvious.

If you don't have a power sunroof and just want to raise the sunroof, flip
down the 2 rear tabs so that they hang vertically, push up the rear of the
sunroof and twist the rear tabs 180 degrees, resting their ends in the
"trough" or gutter that surrounds the roof opening.  If you want to remove
the whole roof, then you have to flip the front tabs down too, and while
holding the rear of the roof up, start sliding the entire roof toward the
rear of the car (better to do this from outside the car!).  The sunroof will
come free once it has cleared the spring-loaded wind-deflector/spoiler.  To
replace, load the roof from the front first and make sure the
wind-deflector/spoiler slides into the sleeve within the front of the
sunroof.  Lower the rear of roof into postition and then lock in place by
flipping all tabs back to their horizontal resting positions.  The power
sunroof should raise automatically, but manual removal is a little trickier.
With key in first position (NOT in on/ignition position), hold the sunroof
toggle switch for a few seconds until you hear the locking arms retract from
the roof and into the body of car (the sunroof should be closed and remain
closed throughout the entire process).  Then you can remove the sunroof
after flipping the forward tabs as you would in a manually-operated sunroof.
Replacement requires you to re-lock the roof (once it is back in place) by
holding the sunroof toggle switch again with the key in the specific
position again.  After a second, you'll hear the arms "re-connect" to the
sunroof.  Hope this helps and was clear enough for you to understand it.
