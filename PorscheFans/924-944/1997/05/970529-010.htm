Please excuse me, PorscheFans!  I re-read my message and I think I must be
allowed to clarify: I meant to say that the Corvette was "5 cars ahead of
[me], and in the HOV lane," and not "way ahead of me."  The original
statement implies that the Corvette was beating a Porsche and we know that
this would never happen!  ;)
