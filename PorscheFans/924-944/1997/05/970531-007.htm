Anybody out there had experience with stainless steel braided brake lines??

I'm looking at the Automotion lines but don't know if they have swivel ends.
Reason for asking is that years ago, I installed a set on a 924 but the end
fittings didn't rotate. Screwing one end in was obviously o.k. but when
screwing the other end in, the braid itself started to twist. In the end I
took off the rotor and screwed that to the line but they must be easier
today. BTW, what's the difference between "ordinary" and DOT ( apart from
the price obviously! )

Word of warning!!

Here in the Gulf we get a number of illegal immigrants who wash cars and
generally do a good ( and cheap ) job. Had mine done today and wished I
hadn't. When the wipers were lifted off the screen, the passenger one folded
back on itself. Mr carwash, not being observant flips the wipers back to the
screen which meant the metal edge hit the bottom of the screen and cracked
it! Any idea how much a new screen is??

Moral of the story - do it on the cheap and it will end up costing a fortune!!

Thanks in advance for any replies.
Alan
