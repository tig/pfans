Agreed Michael, as a GA resident I see this issue everyday and being
european
it trully pisses me off. In France you can denonce authority abuse and
dis
respect of the law by law-enforcement agents. If you are speeding lights
should
be on. If you use your siren for no reason you might get in trouble.
Also not of this no-sense of using the median to cross the hwy. It's
really 
dangerous.. radio for some help.

It's sad most in the summer 'cause those junks are normally on fire
during 
the rush hour on the hwy... Car fire, car fire...!!! ;)

If the law is respected, this truck driver will only drive the regular
8 hrs with his breaks... But the stoping distances and the kynetic
forces
to stop that monster will create a real danger.. Same thing for those
land
boats (caddys, linconls and caprice ) with rear drum brakes ????

And I add my 2 shekkels ;)
