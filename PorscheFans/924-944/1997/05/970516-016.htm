I have been raceing the hoosiers for the past 2 years, and have been in
pretty close contact with Bruce Foss at the factory. 
Here is the deal:

Hoosier race tires like a HOT pressure of 44-45 pounds. that means your
starting air pressure should be between 38 and 40 pounds cold. Don't bother
with different front to back pressures.  Experiment, but don't start lower
than 38 pounds, or the tire will not work properly. You also need to get 220
to 250 degrees of heat across the face to be in the correct range. That
takes a lot of hard cornering (or a little bad cornering <G>).

have fun.
