<< IMHO, Your insurance carrier should give you a DISCOUNT. The whole idea
 of autocrossing is that the driver and car are exposed to less hazards
 than those encountered during normal driving while not exceeding normal
 driving speeds. So not only are you minimizing his exposure while
 autocrossing, you are gaining invaluable experience in what to do if and
 when you actually have a bad highway experience. >>

Paul, tell that to the guy at one of our local SCCA auto-x's 2 yrs ago who
showed
up in a new bone stock Mercury whatever (the same one as the escort).

He ran pretty slow but over cooked a slolom & rolled the car breaking his arm

in the process.  The car was totalled & he was taken away in an ambulance.

This made a good impression on my in-laws who just happened to be in town and
wanted to see me run,  They too got a interesting view of their first auto-x.

We theorize his front tire rolled under too far & the edge of the front
rim dug into the hot tarmac giving instant traction to the left front of the
car in 
the slalom, causing the roll.  Truly a freak occurrence but it does happen.

Anyway I think the point is that the insurance company decides what is
covered 
and what isn't.  If you are told by a representative of your insurance
company that
competitive events aren't covered, they PROBABLY aren't.  And the adjuster
will
PROBABLY do whatever he has to in order to show that what you were doing 
constitutes a competitive event.  By the way, tropies and keeping timed runs
on 
everyone pretty much makes it a competitive event.
