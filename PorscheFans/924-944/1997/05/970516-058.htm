Thanks for the info

>I finally got around to taking a look at the data and, unfortunately, it's
none too conclusive.  Part of the problem with the test, which they
repeatedly state, is that they only test *their* rubber materials with one
type of lubricant for each refrigerant.  However, the article did seem to
indicate that (not too surprisingly) different refrigerants reacted
differently with the different types of rubber.  The test seemed more
oriented at gauging the best compatibility mix between refrigerants and
rubbers than anything else.  It sounded like they were making
recommendations to *new* car makers regarding the best type of rubber to use
with R134a.  What would be nice is a failure analysis test oriented
specifically at testing 10-year-old rubbers against modern refrigerants.  A
compatibility test, if you will.

>In other words, I'm still not sure how significant the problem would be
concerning our cooling systems and FR-12 or R134a.  In fact, I'm still not
convinced by the latest info floating around this list that decade-old cars
are fairly easily converted to R134a.  Maybe I'm just too cynical?  But as
you pointed out in your original post, rubber compatibility could be a
potential problem, and that would include all conversions to anything,
including R134a.

>All this has brought me to finally dig out an article which hits this
refrigerant subject squarely on the head.  It was written by Patrick Bedard
and published in the July 1994 (I think) Car & Driver.  Regardless of what
some of you may think of Patrick Bedard, Car & Driver nonetheless has a
reputation to maintain and they have the resources to obtain information
regarding this subject.  If anyone is interested in the full text of the
article, I have it in a non-formatted text file.  Just email me and I'll
mail it to you-- it's much to long to post to the list in its entirety.

>Mr. Bedard's article says, in part:
>"As carmakers do more testing, retrofits seem less of a nightmare. R-12
systems use mineral oil for internal lubrication; most HFC-134a systems will
use polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil. Those oils don't mix. Which turns out to
be fortunate. The mineral oil remaining in the system, in effect, drops out,
collecting in the evaporator where it may, or may not, cause a serious loss
of efficiency. Amin says instructions with Ford factory retrofit kits will
explain which systems need flushing.
>
>"HFC-134a, as a refrigerant, is less efficient than R-12. It operates at
higher pressures and, for equal performance, needs a more effective
condenser (the heat exchanger forward of the radiator). If you changed only
the refrigerant and the oil, performance losses would be most noticeable
when you're stuck in traffic on hot days. Condenser effectiveness improves
with airflow. Front-drive cars usually have electric cooling fans, and kits
for some of these cars will maintain performance by running the fan more in
traffic. Fans on many rear-drive cars run at engine speed, so these cars
will often need an additional fan, or a larger condenser, or both.
>
>"A poorly engineered retrofit, or a kit intended to be cheap on the
aftermarket, will lose performance. It may also lose durability, because
compressor lubrication with HFC-134a is much more difficult than with R-12.
Ford has set high standards for its factory kits--"No loss of performance,
or durability, or drivability," Amin says. "We've had 55 people working on
this for about two years."
>
>You'll notice that the two major problems are efficiency and compressor
lubrication.  R134a has a different pressure point, which is why those who
have converted notice a drop in cooling efficiency.  Admittedly, this
article is now about 3 years old, so there may be new information.  The
question is, who has it and is it reputable?  As for previous comments
indicating that mixing R-12 and R134a were dangerous, I cannot find that
information, so I may have remembered it incorrectly (a retraction?).
