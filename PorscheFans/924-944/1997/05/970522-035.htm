This is about what I saw today when I drove my son's car.  We just had a
modified banjo bolt installed to go with the Autothority chipset (v??) =
and
I can get the boost in the 1.5+ range but it takes some throttle input.
Not WOT but at least half and probably more.  Anything less and it would
stay about 1.2.  Max boost is just a tick less than 2.0 now and the car
has better driveability.  I like it.

Also had the new Bridgestone S-02 tires installed today.  If they corner
as well as they look we will be pretty impressed.  They look really nice.
