>>>Thanks for the input. The computer was replaced and the car fired right
up. I dont know how the computer logic is set up for monitoring cranking
speed but I had no problem with the new one. Do you think its possible
that my Authority chip caused some sort of failure? I did put back the
factory chip in the old computer but that didnt work either. I dont
think I'm going to install it again. Thanks for your input.

Tommy,

I'm not 100% sure on this, but pretty sure.  As far as I know, the chip
programing can't actually damage hardware.  (just like viruses can't
physically damage a hard drive or other peripheral, it just erases and moves
data saved on it).  The DME doesn't have any such data storage, it's all
solid state electronics.  

If I were you, I'ld call Autothority and ask them about it.  I think they
have lifetime software support, so they'll probably give you a new chip.  I
doubt there's anything wrong  with yours, but depending on when you bought
yours, the chip mapping may be better now.
