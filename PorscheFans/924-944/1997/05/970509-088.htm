Greetings fanatics,

I am new to this group and Porsche ownership.  Although, I did grow up
wrenching on my dad's Porsche's and VW's.  I just purchased a pretty sweet
'82 924, and I have some questions.

The handeling is supurb, very neutral and light.  But, the suspension seems
very able to handle alot more horsepower than the motor can provide (Yeah I
know, the 944 enters the picture here) and I would like to improve on this
situation.  For various reasons, I do not wish to update to a 944 yet.

I have removed the Cat and pre-muffler (Nice being in Idaho with laxed
emission laws) and also removed the intake snorkle and built a 'rain shield'
for the opening.  Where do I go next?  I realize this motor will never be
eating any 5.0 mustangs, but would like it to have a bit more passing punch.

I am also experiencing alot of hot air entering the drivers footwell even
with the heater control in the cold position.  I did verify that the valve
is in fact closed.  Is this normal?

Thanks,

Jay
