good:
went to the dealer and got my timing belts etc. done this weekend, the price was 
right 577. after PCA 10% discount and they let me talk to the tech and he even 
let me help witht the repairs.

bad:
the drive gets longer every freaking time i take it 200mi. is a long way to go!

ugly:
found my power steering leak and it is the rack so if anyone has one let me 
know. i will need some help with the new motor mounts if anyone in the waco 
austin area knows how to do this quickly i will pay for the help.
finally got rid of the shimmy with a new tie rod. now the real ugly 69$ an hour 
flat rate and even though the tech finished in 3 hours i got stuck with a bill 
for 5 hrs. labor at69$ an hour, ouch!!!!

sugg:
lets start a repair shop! i figure if we charged about 50$ an hour and if the 
job goes over the books flat rate then we give book if it is under then we go 
under. we get all the parts we can from george b. is this sounding good to 
anyone else.????  seems like a good idea to me!!!!!!!  just so you guys know i 
used the porsche-volvo dealer in San Antonio and if anyone is in that area a 
really recommend them they are very nice and the work was satisfactory if not 
better. talk to wesley in service or barry in parts.
