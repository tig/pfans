Folks,

For 9 months I've owned a '90 944 S2 Cabriolet.  I've
enjoyed the car, and started auto-crossing this season.
That experience is tuning my sensitivity to the car's
handling, and to my driving of course.  It's been a hoot! I
recently put Bridgestone SO-2's all around, and the
increased grip is a revelation (happy to comment on the
tires if you send along a query).

I've noticed two things about the car, that have been
confirmed by an experienced 944 driver/PCA track
instructor:

1) There is a floating feeling in the front when
travelling over gentle dips and rises over 50mph.

2) There is a fairly large amount of vibration going over
rougher roads (i.e. rippled concrete, person-hole covers ...)
that is transmitted through the steering wheel --
presumably due to chassis twist about the longitudinal
axis; cowl shake.

Yesterday, for comparison, I drove a '94 968 Cabriolet, and
after the test drive, took my 944 over the same route.  The
968 has less cowl shake, and also seems to pitch (nose up/down)
less on acceleration and braking.  Otherwise the balance
felt similar, and both cars have about the same response to
throttle on/off in tight turns.

The difference in pitching leads me to ask if the
two cars are sprung differently. Does anyone know if
there are fundamental suspension differences between
these cars, or am I seeing a deficiency in my particular
car (e.g. shocks or other suspension components)???  The
968 in question had the standard suspension, as does my
944 (i.e. no sport suspension or shocks).

[I was surprised at the profound difference in engine
sound between the S2 and the 968.  The latter sounds much
more hollow - as if the odd harmonics are missing.
Curious.]

I'm considering putting a roll bar in the car so I can
do PCA driver's ed events - and also to allow a 5pt harness
for comfort/control during autocross (SCCA requires a bar
if you put a harness in an open car).  I expect the bar
will stiffen things a little.  I'm not willing to go to
a cage to achieve a better chassis.

Does anyone have any experience/wisdom as to the effect a bar
might have?  Or how much of a nuisance it will be for everyday
use?

As always, I'm sure I'll receive informative responses, and
am grateful in advance.
