I read this list almost every day, and truely appreciate the vast
and varied amount of real-time day-to-day information provided. I don't
race my car.  It sounds like great fun.  I just can't find the time-
maybe in the future?  I drive my car when I need a rush.  My Bronco is
my daily driver. 
 
   	  I chipped my '86 951 with Autothority last year.  To me, it's much
faster (read quicker).  The extra power is there when I need (want) it. 
I chipped the car purely for selfish reasons- I like knowing the extra
power is there.  It's tough to use that power around the city, but
nonetheless it's there.  Mostly I putt-putt around, with only short
bursts of zip when I can.  Fun is what it's all about!  :)

    	 Bottom line, with the chips, K&N, good plugs, techron every once
in a while, new Yoko's, sport suspension, etc., the car is just plain
FUN.  I've read on this list both sides of the chipping question.  I've
been told by a local 911/944 race shop that the mapping on new chips is
just plain better (more advanced), and with care, chipping the engine
won't hurt.  Many of you have heard otherwise.  It sounds like it's a
toss up. I do believe, however, that more stress is put on the gaskets,
etc., when the engine is chipped.  Is it worth the potential decrease in
engine life?  Thats subjective.  For me, it is.  It's like the debate on
whether or not the WWII P-51 fighters should be race modified.  Thats an
extreme comparison, but valid.  There's no question that it decreases
their engine life, and they're running out of Merlin engines! But they
do it anyway.  It's simply performance vs. longevity.  

	IMHO, I just don't believe chips overexert the 951 engine too much to
worry about-given the way I drive is no doubt much less stressful than
how the cars are driven at track events.  Just my .02 cents. Sorry about
the length.  Thanks to everyone for this list!!!
