Yes, I believe the factory drain bolt (on my 951, at least) is magnetic and
serves to attract loose metal particles from the oil.  I was surprised to
discover this, since I've only heard of magnetic drain bolts being used in
aircraft engines.  I don't know whether or not the the new valve in question
would allow a harmful accumulation of these particles.
