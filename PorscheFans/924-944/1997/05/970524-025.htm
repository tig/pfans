Kevin:

Thanks for the advice re: my 944 trans bearings.  I think that I may
have gotten my terminology screwed up a bit.  Let me describe the
problem.  The drive flange that comes out of the transmission case
appears to have excess play particularly radially.  I would estimate
that the part can be moved about 0.010" radially.  I had assumed that
the drive flange rode in a bearing in the trans case, apparently that is
not the case.  Do you think that the situation I described could be
caused by the drive flange bolt being loose?  Any other ideas?  Is this
a normal condition?

I would greatly appreciate any advice.


Regards,

Trevor Day

The pinion shaft bearings require a complete tear-down of the transmission, the diff bearings require that you at least remove the gear carrier (center steel section) from the case before beginning the work.
