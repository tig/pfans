Hey Barry,

I know the feeling.My old mechanic, Skip, was the same way and he was
the only one in Ga. to be certified by porsche to work in a factory race
car in the pit stops. ( learned about that by another PO.. ) Skip would
bring you to the car and show you exactly what was going on, and also if
he see you interest in do it yourself he would take his time to show you
how as well... 

Adrien.

PS : skip just moved back to Tenesse, so if any P-fanatic get lucky to
get his services .. enjoy it !!!
