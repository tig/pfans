It sure does!  You can also get a difference in the readings depending on
whether you counterrotate the crankshaft (to go back the 1.5 teeth that
some here and the manual teach) or not.  I had the same concerns when I did
my belts and I read the post which has you using the tool in the opposite
fashion from what I remember.  I recall placing the tool so that the two
flat pieces go on the bottom of the belt (against the teeth) and the center
piece against the flat backside of the belt.  I also recall placing the
tool so that the dial was on the left-hand side (when facing the engine
from the front of the car).  Regardless, the correct method is the one
which makes the belt the loosest to get the same reading.  I remember doing
it both ways and the too-tight method certainly felt all wrong.  You'd best
check with a full-time Porsche mechanic (and write me back so I can get the
story straight).

Yes, they will generally look loose, even to the point of being considered
too loose.  If I remember right, it's pretty easy to twist the belt half a
turn when it's adjusted about right.  Just make sure you set it to what's
recommended and then check it after the first 3-5,000 miles or so.  Make
sure you check, rotate two revolutions, and check again (several times).

That's how mine was as well and I checked, rechecked, and rechecked... and
it ran fine (I've got it parked right now).  You don't need the belts to be
tight since they've got teeth.  Most of us (especially me) like to see
things tightly in place and this comes from our experience with accessory
belts which have no teeth.
