Hey guys & gals

There's a new parts guy in town who is just starting up and sells all parts
at a discount, including o.e. Porsche parts.  He is a Chicago PCA member
and used to work at one of the local independent shops here.  Give him a
chance to quote you - what have you got to lose??  I just bought new front
rotors from him for $85 each.  Here is his info:
        Bob "Turbo Bob" Turner
        PARTSBAHN EXPRESS
        Algonquin, Illinois
        847-458-0650
        ILXLR8@aol.com (e-mail)

Happy Hunting
