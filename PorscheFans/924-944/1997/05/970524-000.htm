Be careful Bill.  The officer may have written the ticket knowing that you
were from out of state and would probably not contest the issue any further.
Instead of just doing what he wants and paying the fine, I suggest looking
into the local law codes a little bit (if you care enough).  I did my own
research and, depending on the county/region you were in, all you have to do
is prove that your detector was not ON at the time, and you can get the
charge dismissed.
        You were lucky he didn't confiscate your detector.  They usually
give you the choice of either re-claiming the detector after the court has
used it as evidence, or just relinquishing it to the municipal gov't
forever.  Most have discovered that it's not worthwhile to try and get their
detector back because the fee charged when recovering it always exceeds the
cost of several brand new radar detectors.
        Good luck.  Being a Virginian myself, I sympathize with your
situation and anticipate the day when VA emerges from the Dark Ages and gets
with the times.  Front license plate requirement and less than 50% tint on
the side windows?  GIVE ME A BREAK!  I've been pulled over 5 times for
illegal tint (71% sides & quarters, 95% rear), and twice for not having my
front license plate mounted (I was "pulled over" while parked once for
this!).  Never received a ticket, but I've been lucky and it's still a
hassle.  Then there's also the horror stories of motorcycle cops who carry
razors and actually remove your tint at the scene!  Jeez!  I'm not letting
ANYONE touch my car--I'm going down like Rodney King if that ever happens!
You guys will bail me out when they take me downtown, right?
