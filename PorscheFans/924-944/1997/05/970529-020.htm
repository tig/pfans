Clark,


I had the exact same problem with my 951, the TPS was the problem.  While
the car was idling at 2000 RPM I could tap on the TPS and cause it to drop
only to have it go back up again once I applied throttle.  By the way the
computer usually detects this fault and will cause your boost to be limited
to 1.2 bar.  My 951 did the exact same thing.




				Brent, hope this helps
				86 951

P.S I purchased a new TPS for $50.00 dollars from someone on this list.

Good Luck
