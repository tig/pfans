OK, you guys with the sunroofs, here's a larger
canopy problem.  My S2 Cab top is half dead.  Motor
runs to lower but not to rise.  (This is the Faraday
gremlins taking their revenge for all the gorgeous weather
we've had here.)  I can hear the relay clicking, but the
motor don't go.  I want to put a voltmeter on the motor to test
the hypothesis (hope) that it's the relay contacts rather
than the motor (for which I will have to take out a mortgage
to replace, no doubt).  Problem is, I haven't the slightest
notion where the motor is.  (Yes I know, this is somewhat
akin to hunting around for the blinker fluid reservoir.)
I took off the interior back side panel on the drivers side,
and it appears that the mechanism is driven by a cable
that runs back towards the trunk.  I wasn't willing to
start ripping the carpet out of the trunk without a
hint as to the general vicinity of the prize.

I can't locate the motor by sound because there's just
generally lots of noise back there when it runs (like IMAX
Dolby surround sound).  Anybody know about this?  Anybody
want to guess?  Anybody want to place wagers?

Actually, I don't mind operating it manually as it's much
faster!  But in the interests of restoring operation to its
former pristine self ... and defeating the gremlins

TIA
