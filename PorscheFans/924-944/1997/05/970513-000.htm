Jon,
I had the same problem after replacing a heater inlet hose.  Near the
fire wall you will find a short hose coming from the engine.  This is
the heater inlet hose, it is attached to a plastic valve which is
attached to a longer hose that continues down and through the fire wall
to the heater coil (i believe).  Coming from the heater valve is a
vaccum hose, it looks like a long tan colored straw, this needs to be
bent downward and inserted in a rubber piece which has a hole in it. 
This is what actuates the heater valve, thus controlling whether you get
heat or cool air.  If it is not attached the valve can become stuck
causing it to either give you a lot of heat or no heat. In my case I got
heat no matter what I set the control at.  If this isn't the problem
either your valve is stuck by some other means or the valve is bad.  I
think they run between 40-50 bucks mail order. Good Luck
