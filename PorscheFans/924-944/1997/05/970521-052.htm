Yes, I had this happen and repaired.

The car was down for nearly a month. Porsche will not officially admit that 
there is a problem. The reason (supposedly) for the delay was re-doing it a 
couple of times due to very critical measurements and installations of shims. 
It was getting to the point where I wanted a remanufactured unit. I believe 
the factory did weigh the costs, as a possiblity. My car was/is a '95 M030 
w/limited slip (torsen flavored). It started making the noise when I was 
with-in warranty (but not much). The noise hasn't returned (yet, knock on 
wood). It was most noticable at around 37 to 41 mph in third gear. The 
service manager did say off the record the Porsche knew of a problem with the 
trannies. Can I/we assume yours has limited slip?

Anybody else? I'd be happy to assemble a list.

 REPLY FROM: Murray, Matthew D.   From: GARY_GOELKEL 
I have heard that a small number of 968s were delivered with transaxles with
improperly loaded "output shaft bearings" (assembly error).  The result is
premature bearing failure.  My 1994 968 with 30K miles may be one of those
delivered that way, and I now hear a rear end sound similar to a sewing
machine motor going all out at speeds above 60 miles per hour.  The dealer
is confirming the diagnosis, and I don't have any additional information to
offer at the moment.

My questions are:

1.  Has anyone heard of this problem before?
2.  Does anyone have knowledge about cases where Porsche has covered the
cost of the repair out of normal car warrantee?
3.  Approximately how long should the repair take assuming the output shaft
bearings need replacement?
4.  How long should the output shaft bearings last in normal use?
5.  Does anyone know the range of VIN#s affected?

The dealer is not releasing me much information including possible cost,
possible Porsche participation in the repair, etc. yet.  I would like to
have some independent information before I get into that discussion with
them once they confirm the diagnosis.  Initial estimates seem to indicate a
week of work to do the job.  I can't get out of them whether that is elapsed
or actual labor time.

Any useful advice or comments are welcome.

Best regards,
Gary
