Fellow Porsche friend's:

Is there a cross reference list for parts available for the 924/944/951?

I have, in my ever ongoing quest for repair parts, seen a lot of
products and part numbers that makes me suspect that many expensive
Porsche part isn't.

Example: It seems that (info from the Koni data sheets) that the red
Koni front 944 inserts are the same as the Volkswagen 1303 strut part...

Would the hub itself be the same, and are we running our 944:s on VW
beetle bearings in the front?

The steel A-arm is the same as the Golf/Jetta ('Rabbit' for you US
folks), but are the bushings also the same? 

I have used a thermoswitch from a VW - and it worked perfectly.

I am sure there are many similar cases, as the cooperation between
VW/Audi and Porsche was pretty intensive when the 944 was constructed.

If there is any way we can collectively verify and summarize information
of this kind, and/or would that be of interest?
