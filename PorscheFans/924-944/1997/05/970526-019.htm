I never understood why some clubs insist on putting the timing lights so
close to the starting line, essentially forcing to you abuse your
drivetrain to get a good start. This seems more common at SCCA/non-PCA
events...perhaps because of the Mustang contingent?

Obviously those of us with turbocharged cars benefit from a rolling start,
but *everyone* can appreciate reduced drivetrain (and tire) wear-and-tear
from avoiding hard launches. If you belong to a club which puts the lights
very close to the starting line, why not bring it up at the next meeting or
event and find out who else would prefer a rolling start? We should
petition event organizers and course designers for fun, competitive events
which don't require us to abuse our clutches.
