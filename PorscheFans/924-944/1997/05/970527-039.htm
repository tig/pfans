<<You are correct, steel arms are not infallible.  I wrote about using
steel arms as a less expensive alternative to replacing the aluminum
arms if a person is not concerned with originality.

One benefit to the steel arms is that they can be tested and repaired
(or replaced) quite easily and at a lower cost.  They can also easily be
modified to strenthen them.  Cracks can casually be detected if they are
inspected before racing/driving events.  Steel plates can easily be
welded on to reinforce them for racing use.>>

I'd like to add my $.02 to the use of steel control arms. I broke 2 on
my '84 944 while autocrossing. Fortunately, both failures occurred
during rather slow-speed corners and went through the hole you must
drill in the control arm to install the Weltmeister 28MM swaybar. This
creates a stress riser that wil eventually lead to the failure occuring
at that point. As others will attest, whether you drill the hole or not
the control arms will eventually fail if subjected to the rigors of
autocrossing or racing.

If you are planning to autocross or race your 924/944 with steel control
arms, I'd definitely strengthen them. The control arms from any of the
924/944/VW Rabbit cars can be used interchangably. As with any other
mechanical component essential to your safety, they should be carefully
inspected on a frequent basis.

I won't embarrass myself by telling you the story of the moron who
actually saw the fatigue crack in the outer edge of a steel control arm
prior to the actual failure and didn't replace it immediately.
