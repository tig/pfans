-- [ From: Richard Luker * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Just to add a little to the thread about starters.

The American Bendix starter was called the Lucas Inertia drive starter in
the UK. Both throw the pinion along a coarse thread to engage with the
flywheel gear ring. Generally the pinion moved towards the starter. When the
engine started the pinion was disengaged and thrown back against a strong
spring. 

It differs from the Pre-engaged starter where the solenoid moves the pinion
into mesh with the flywheel before the starter motor turns. 

All this takes me back 30 years when as part of my engineering
apprenticeship I had to draw diagrams of all the parts with notes explaining
how they worked. Do they still have to do that these days or is decent
training seen as a waste of money?
