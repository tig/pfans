Steve,
      I have replaced the front tires with Dunlop D40M2's($100->$120 each). 
The tires in the rear are still whatever was on the vehicle when I purchased 
it (I don't remember). The D40M2's stick very well, but wear quickly. I also 
ran them for about 1K miles before doing needed front end repairs, and they 
are now a bit out of round as is evident by slight shake at 60->75 mph (I had 
worn ball joints). Many on the list have suggested Pirelli P6000's?? If your 
vehicle is aligned, and all components are good, you shouldn't have any 
problems with the D40M2's (If you have any worn components, I would of course 
suggest replacing them). There have been many complaints on the list about 
Dunlop SP8000's, out of round, exceedingly quick wear, etc.. Please let me 
know what you decide, and how they work, I am interested in additional 
data/opinions..

Good Luck!
Ezra
