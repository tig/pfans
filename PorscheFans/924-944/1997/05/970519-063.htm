The 944 manual and 944 faq provide two different methods for setting the belt
tension with the auto-tensioner.  The faq says to back off 1.5 teeth on the cam
sprocket (from TDC) then release the tensioner.  The manual doesn't say
anything about backing off 1.5 teeth, it simply says go to TDC, release
tensioner.

>From doing this before, it seemed that I got closer readings (checked with
gauge) when I backed off the cam sprocket 1.5 teeth.  Could the manual be
wrong?

The plain and simple fact is that it is hard to get the tension to read the
same value all the time.  It is a time consuming process.  Turn to TDC, release
tensioner, rotate, check tension, do it again, and again, and again...
Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off without the dang auto-tensioner.


My car also does the below.  You might try turning the tensioner upside down.

Don't tap the crank to and fro.  Leave the crank exactly where you stopped your
TDC march.  Then take measurements.

Hope this helps.
