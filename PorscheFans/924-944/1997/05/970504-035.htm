Thanks to everyone for answers to my previous post!
Hi all,

I had a noise that would go away when I turned hard enough left to =
un-weight the left front, and as everyone thought, it was a wheel =
bearing.  So I just spent 4 hours (thought it would be 1 or 2!) changing =
it, and thought I would relate a little of the experience.

The worst part was removing the old races.  I swear the thing only moved =
a hundredth of a millimeter every time I hit it!  For those who have =
never had the pleasure of doing so, there are two notches in the hub =
that allow you to get a screwdriver (or some more appropriate tool) =
inside the edge of the bearing race.  After much hammering, a beer, and =
a cigar, I finally got them both out (yeah!).  I knurled up the inside =
of the hub a bit, but I smoothed it out and everything went back =
together OK.  It also took a lot longer than I thought it would to =
properly pack the bearings.

The good news is, no more noise and the steering wheel is vibration =
free.  It feels like a new car!

Now if I can only get rid of the 3300 rpm vibration in the shifter.  =
Yeah, I know, get the balance shaft checked  ;-)

Thanks everyone!

Andy Boutcher
