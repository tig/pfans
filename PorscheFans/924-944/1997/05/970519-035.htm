I just purchase an '86 944 about a month ago, and I have a couple of
qestions I was hoping someone could help me with.  The car did not have
an owner's manual, just the service records- what are the two sliding
knobs on the dash for?  I assume for the heating/a.c., but I dont see
any difference when I move them.  Also, on the console, there is a
switch next to the sunroof switch that looks like it has a flag or
something on it... what does it do?  I don't notice any changes when I
flip it either.  Also, how do you pop out the sunroof.  The guy I bought
it from showed me, but when I went to do it myself, I couldn't figure it
out.  I know these are kind of simplistic questions, but I am a newbee
and would appreciate any info.  I love the car by the way.
