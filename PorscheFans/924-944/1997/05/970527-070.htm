For those finding mysterious leaks around or under their car, some
detective work may be in order. Fluids can be of many kinds:

Brake/clutch fluid can drip from the clutch slave or the clutch or brake
main cylinder. The main clutch cylinder usually leak into the driver
foot well. Brake fluid is water mixable, and stirring a sample with
water, it will mix nicely. 

Engine oil is usually just that - oily! It is mostly black, and don't
readily mix with water. Can drip from a lot of places but often from the
front or aft end of the engine.

Water usually comes from the water pump, heater valve or leaking hoses.
Hoses can leak because they are not sufficiently fastened or downright
old and porous. Cooling fluid may look a lot like brake fluid when
fresh, but does dry up - brake fluid doesn't (as quickly, at least).

When I was in the Army (no obvious Porsche connection, except for the
ancient German Ferdinand tank) I learned the handy 'Wet point check',
basically checking all fluid points on the vehicle before driving: 

Coolant, brake fluid, oil levels in engine power steering (and the AC
sight glass), battery level (will often be seen from the outside)        

This rough check takes very little time, and made once a day it will
give you fair warning of errors on many occasions.
