I want to thank everybody for their help on my previous post. 
Unfortunately I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong w/ my 951. 
The noise in my RR corner sounds like a loose brake pad, and it clunks
when I drive oover any bumps, but everything is tight back there.  I
don't know if its the cv-joint, could it be a wheel bearing?  My
hesitation problem is still here.  It only happens when cold and below
4000rpms.  It still feels like I am pulling a seated, pregnant yak.

I am going to throw my .02 in.  I have been listening to all the threads
for quite a while about chips.  I have talked to a person here in the
Daytona Beach area that builds engines for teams that race in the Rolex
24.  He said that these engines can take it, however he recommends the
following: On 1986's he installs a knock sensor.  On all years he
installs an Air/Fuel monitor, as well as a boost regulator and tell tale
boost gauge.  By knowing precisely what is going on when you're on boost
and off boost you can make sure your engine is ok, and remove the worry
that your head gasket will go the way of the dodo.
