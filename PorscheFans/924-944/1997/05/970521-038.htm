Insert rather long snip here

I think I can safely say that a whole bunch of us would greatly appreciate
any information you would be willing to share.  If possible, could you also
get us the 3M web page address?  (Jay, it may be too late for you, but it
will make it easier for you to do my car next month - remember?).

Anyway, Mark, thanks a lot for the info you have already shared with us.
I, for one, will share this data with my fellow PCAers.
