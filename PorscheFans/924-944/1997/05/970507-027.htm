Hello to all.

I'm relatively new to this list, but have seen a lot of discussion about
chipping our cars.  When discussing this subject with my factory trained
mechanic at my Porsche dealership (who has also been working on Porsches
for 22 years) he tells me "DON'T DO IT".  He says that the slight additional
increase in horsepower does not compensate for the greater increase in engine
wear and tear caused by the extra mechanical stresses of running the engine
harder.  (his definition of slight HP increase is ~30HP or more)
He says that in 1985 when my car was built, it was built with the maximum
tolerances that were mechanically practical or possible with the technology
currently available.  In other words if the engine was capable of producing
lets say 250HP stock, then Porsche would have built it that way in 1985.  To
go above and beyond the factory technical specifications would be similar to
going beyond engineering tolerances and could lead to material failure, i.e.,
cracked head, damaged pistons, rings, etc., etc.  He basically convinced me
that if I went ahead with the new chip, I should be prepared at some point
to have enough $$'s set aside for an engine rebuild.  I have not chipped my
car at this point.  Obviously, since a great many of you have successfully
run your cars with updated chips, there must be more to this story than what
I am hearing from the dealership.

Are the engines in the 1988-1991 951's identical to the 1986/1987 engines,
and the ONLY difference is the chip?  If so, then I don't see why I should
have a problem with chipping my car.  With the amount of engineering and
research & development Porsche does, it seems likely to me that my 1986 951
would be running at its optimum when it is totally stock.  If I was to then
alter any of the stock engine characteristics, such as chipping, then I am
putting undue and unreasonable stress on the engine which will shorten it's
overall lifespan.  After all, the engine was designed to output X horsepower,
not X+30 horsepower.  Right?  I also realize that the updated chips alter the
fuel/air mixture among other things and also make the engine run hotter.  Now
we're getting into the physics and mechanical engineering of the do's and do
nots of chipping.  How much shorter will my engine life be after chipping?
And what about the extra stress that will be put on the transmission?  The
transmission was built in 1985 and matched to the stock horsepower in my car.
Will my transmission's life also be shortened?

Does anyone, chipped or unchipped or contemplating chipping, have an opinion
on this, or could you please give me some insight on this?  I don't mind
driving around with the stock 217HP my car has but if it can be increased
WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY of engine/transmission damage or unnatural wear and
tear then I would like to chip my car.

All thoughts, opinions, comments, criticisms good or bad, or just your general
..02 cents worth, are welcomed.
