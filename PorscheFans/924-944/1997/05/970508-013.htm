While the 3-pc wheels look cool and are huge, do you really want something
that wide on the street?  My car, when delivered had 17x8.5 up front and
17x10 in the rear with 235/45R17 up front and 255/40R17 in the rear.  The
car tramlined horribly, you were constantly fighting the steering wheel
to keep it straight, even on what looked like smooth roads.  Those were
OZ Racing Futora wheels, which will likely have the same offset as the
OZ wheels you are looking at.  I knew that this could not possible be how
Porsche would have wanted it and got rid of those really quick.  They
are now on a 928 in our racing club and they look and fit much better on
that car than they ever did on my 944T.

>Maybe we should consider stock 1-piece 993 rims.  Anyone know of a good
>source?

Paul picked up a set of 993 1-pc wheels with Potenza S-02 tires at a very,
very attractive price from Weissach Performance http://www.weissach.com.  They
could ship to you I'm sure and they have lots of them in stock.  They also
have the 17" technology wheel, but computer simulations I've done show that
wheel does not look good on the 944T.
