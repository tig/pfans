I've been enjoying my new S2 for a month now - so far, it's been perfect. 
Well, OK, a few minor glitches.  The only one I haven't figured out so 
far is the stereo.  It's a Blaupunkt New Orleans, and usually works fine, 
but occasionally will not eject the CD.  When this happens, I have to 
spend several minutes (after stopping, natch) fooling with it, and 
waiting patiently until it decides to do something.  I don't hear 
anything whirring so I feel it's electronic, not mechanical.  Best luck 
I've had was to unplug the faceplate and wait, then replug and try again. 

I know, minor complaint compared to clutch or water pump problems, but it 
can be annoying.  Anyone have similar problems with Blau CDs?  Any 
suggestions?  I'm pretty handy electronically, but unless I know where to 
look...   

Thanks to any replies.

Jerry
