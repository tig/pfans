Warning:  this is a long post of quantitative results of before/after chips.

The collective wisdom of the group was about 10:1 that I should put a chipset
in my '87 951.  Did it today.  You (collective) and especially Farzaan, may
find the following quantitative data interesting.  The qualitative stuff
comes later.

The before/after data is averaged from four "runs" at the specified gear and
rpm.  Two runs in each direction.  This should average out windage and
uphill/downhill grades, as much as possible.  Feel free to email or discuss
on list if interested in more specifics:

Gear          RPM's          Before        After      % improvement
3              3-4,000           2.875        2.725          5.2%
3              4-5,000           3.1            2.6            16.1%
3              5-6,000           3.025        2.75            9.0%

4              3-4,000           4.9            4.6              6.1%
4              4-5,000           6.075         5.0             17.6%
4              5-6,000           sorry- too much traffic, too much radar

5               3-4,000          8.575         7.375           13.9%
5               4-5,000           need a track for this one
5               5-6,000           see above

What the data means is 1)  the gear I was in      2)  WOT from x-x rpm's   
3)  elapsed time in seconds before and after chipset

What surprised me, and leads to a question for the group is this:  Prior to
these runs I installed a VDO boost guage.  I tested w/ the chips, and thought
I'd test again after installing the re-jetted banjo bolt.  Guess what, the
jetted banjo bolt didn't change boost at all.  The chips, however, did.  The
chips alone upped the max boost by 2 psi, came in earlier (3,000 vs 3,800)
and maintained it longer (5,500 vs 5,000) before it started backing the boost
down.  Why didn't the jetted bolt increase the boost?  The stock bolt had no
restrictor at all.  I thought the restricted banjo bolt would increase boost.
 Any help?

Subjectively, I LOVE the chips.  I remember Farzaan's earlier post where they
were running 20 inches of boost, or something like that (too much for the IRL
as I recall).  He described loosing traction at seams in the pavement of a
bridge.  Whoooaaaah, whoooaaaah, irrrrrkkkkk, whooooaaaaah (I don't recall
his exact words).  I got the same sort of thing on a stretch of interstate I
drive often.  Never had traction probs before under full acceleration.  Nice
problem to have!

I've taken up enough space.  Look forward to hearing from the turbos in the
group.  (not a "turbo snob" comment)

'87 951  (why'd I wait so long?)
'77 911S  (do they make chips for these?)
