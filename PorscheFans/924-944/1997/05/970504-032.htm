Radial tyres have a inbuilt problemy that is detrimental to high speed
strength. Originally (when Michelin invented the steel radial) it was
found to be stiffer than the diagonal ply tire, and the belt was infact
so stiff that sidewall had to be made softer to make the tire work. This
soft side construction make it harder to build a true high speed tyre.

Therefore high speed tyres are sometimes either radial tyres with
stiffer sides and more flex in the 'belt' - wich do not give localized
high temperatures in the sidewall. There is also racing tyres that are
constructed this way, albeit the majority of racing tyres are of
different construction from street tires - in a way pretty much like the
old diagonal plied tyres of yesteryear, but with hi-tech materials and
production... 

The manufacturers think (rightly in my HO) that the guy needing Z rated
tyres also want stickier, softer rubber. This is the main reason for
lesser thread wear, but it is also combined with a slightly less stiff
base for the thread - wich doesn't help either.  Pay and play...
