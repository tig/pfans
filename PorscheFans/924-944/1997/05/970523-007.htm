Hi group:

I said good-bye to my '88 Turbo S last night.  Like Lee's its silver
rose and plaid (ltd. edition).  Mid-day drive down I275 to the
airport to meet new owner flying in from Reno.  Not much of a drive
to commemorate good times together, construction barrels dampered any
exuberant driving.

But I have many great track-time memories.  We romped at Road
America, many times at Mid-Ohio and Putnam Park.  The car is fast and
got much respect.  I'll not soon forget the effortless jump in speed
at boost, the way cars disappear in your mirror and the cornering.

Now its gone, I wonder if I shouldn't have explored the potential
still within it.  It was stock, save for track pads, and a 33 bar
rear brake regulator.  Acquired at 23,000 miles it gave me 14,000
miles of joy.  Could have looked into a stroker crank and bigger
turbo.  Too late now, perhaps another 951 someday.  

Thanks for the memories car, I trust your new owner will treat you
right.  Well he should, you are tight, clean and maintained by the
book.  Just the "Cherry" we all look for with good history.

So, Porsche #4 is gone.  I've loved them all: 914(s), 911SC, 928S and
the 951.  Each with a distinct personality.  Wonder what I'll get
next.  Any suggestions group?
