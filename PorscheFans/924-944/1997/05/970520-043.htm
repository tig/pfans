Looks like I may have come across an important maintenance item in the
Porsche Fans site just in time. My '87 944S only has 152000 miles on it and I
have not changed the cam tensioner or the chain on it yet (no bragging
intended). The vehicle is street driven only so I guess that helps a lot.
About 4 mos. ago I replaced the gasket and all the grommets on the cam cover
and did notice the cam chain had worn into the tensioner a bit. Does anyone
know what the cost to have the chain and tensioner replaced (just in case I
need it done) would be? This does not seem to be a job for the backyard
mechanic does it? What was that sound again that the chain makes just before
it's too late?????
