With all this talk lately of high failure rates of the 944 series =
aluminum A-arms, I was wondering what was the consensus of the group as =
to the cause of the failures?  Was it really a design fault or a =
manufacturing fault?  Many sources claim it is a design fault ( =
Automotion's catalog states that the 944 A-arms were =
'uncharacteristically under-engineered'  - I take that to read as =
structurally under-designed for strength/fatigue), but I find that hard =
to believe that Porsche can't properly do structural design.

Aside from lack of maintenance and inspection, there are two problem =
areas.  The first is cars which have had huge sway bars installed =
without upgrading the coil springs.  This puts a large amount of stress =
in the middle of the arm, at the sway bar drop link's pick-up, and arms =
have been seen to fail there.  My advice would be to get the basic =
spring rates right with torsion bars and coil springs, use the sway bars =
to enhance and tune.

The second source of problems occurs in cars which have been lowered.  =
It is possible for the ball joint stem to run out of rotational travel, =
and that has apparently lead to some which have broken at the stem.

Unfortunately, I haven't seen any really hard mechanical analysis done =
by anyone, least of all the people at Automotion.  I agree that the =
Porsche factory people are, on balance, better engineers than most =
aftermarket parts houses' salesmen.
