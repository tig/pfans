There is something to be said about a concours condition vehicle.  There is
also some thing to be said about a 944 Turbo S.

I own both (right now).  I just returned from school in my concours 87
944S.  It is a beautiful machine for when I want to troll along.  When I
want to get down and dirty I have a 89 Turbo S (not concours) that
satisfies the other part of my soul.  It is not as pretty as the 944S, but
I don't have a fit when I see a clump of dirt in the road.

Take two and call me in the morning...
