Arif & Dave,

Does that mean that the 993 engine will not break or that the maintenance
issues are, for all intensive purposes, nil?

How about performance; keeping handling in mind too?  I am not spitting on
the 993, it is a wonderful car and I do not know too much about it.

Costs are another issue.  A 944 Turbo at $20,000 will require a lot of
repairs before you reach cost parity with the entry price of a 993.  Then
again, there is down time while it is being serviced.  I guess that is
something that each individual has to put their own price tag on.

The early 911 has both character and, shall we say, a unique handling
attribute.  The cars can reach excellent performance margins with the right
hands on the wheel.  That kind of driving takes 12/10ths concentration and
skill to match.  Still, some people love them for that very characteristic.

The new 993 and the all wheel drive cars have dialed out most of the evil
traits associated with the earlier cars.  I prefer the 944 and 928 to the
911 series for cockpit ergonomics and drivers position.

I own a 1989 Turbo (S) that I really enjoy driving, but my skill level is
very much amateur so I do not draw the full abilities out of my car.
Nevertheless, it is a joy for me.  I did not appreciate the car as much
when I first got it, but as I drove it more I found that it really grew on
me.  Now as the car sits in the garage getting a new clutch I have returned
to my daily driver 944.  That car feels anemic and scrawny compared to the
Turbo (like a wobbling shopping cart).  Sorry for the comparison, but I am
thankful it still is a Porsche.

Nobody has asked you, Arif, what you want to do with a new car.  Do you
want a track car, a street car, or something in between?  Will this be a
daily driver, or a special event car?  All of these things effect the
decision process.
