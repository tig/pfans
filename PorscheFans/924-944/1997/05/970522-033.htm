Lots of questions with not one asking what type of homebrew is needed to
properly wax a vehicle - huh?

1.  What is the difference between a cleaner, polish, & glaze?  There really
isn't an answer to this one.  Different manufacturers name their products
differently without much commonality.  You can be fairly certain that all 3
contain an abrasive of some type.  Generally the most aggressive would be the
cleaner, then polish, then glaze.  Of coarse "compound" would be the most
coarse of all.  All of these categories are not designed to protect the paint
after use unless you are using a "One Step" type product which will do both
polish and protect but not as well as polishing with one product and then
protecting with another (only true for automotive products).

2.  What is the best way to get a reasonable finish without using a rotary
buffer?  Lot's of elbow grease.  A general rule of thumb is that if you can
slightly feel a scratch with your fingernail, it can easily be removed with a
rotary buffer.  It can be remove with more difficulty using paper towels and
the same polish.  If you can really feel the scratch and the scratch is not
down to primer, you can generally bet that wet sanding will be required
followed by compounding then polishing then waxing.  Acid rain spots are
usually impossible to completely remove without some type of edge effect.

3.  What is 3M's web page?  www.mmm.com/market/automobile/index.html

4.  What about paint clay?  Can't say much except that some people swear by it
and other do not.  I have used it but found better product that work with less
difficulty.

5.  What is the difference between a paste wax and a liquid wax?  There are
many depending upon what type of each product you are talking about.
Generally, (I'm not being a wimp by using this statement but someone will
discount what is being said if there is one example that does not fit the
description of what is being discussed) a liquid wax is an emulsion type
product.  These products fall into two categories, a water in oil (w/o) or an
oil in water (o/w).  You can tell what you have by passing a current between
two electrodes (conductivity meter) and seeing if you get a reading.  If you
get some type of current, you have an o/w emulsion since water is a conductor
of electricity.  Another way to distinguish the two is to rub some of the
product onto your hands and then try to remove the product with just water.  If
the product comes off cleanly without using soap, it is an o/w emulsion.
Generally, o/w emulsion products are not as durable as w/o.  The first term is
the discontinuous phase that is "dispersed" in the second term.  To do this,
chemicals called surfactants are used.  These surfactants are used to keep the
product looking like a creamy white liquid.  Without them, the oil and water
phase would separate (some manufacturers make a product with two phases and
claim it is meant to be that way when in actuality it is poor chemistry that
they are using as a marketing gimmick - "...shake product before use to
activate product").  What else is made with surfactants - SOAP and ice cream.
Herein lies the problem with emulsified products (paste or liquid).  Some
surfactant will always remain in the coating that you have applied to your
paint.  So, the next time you wash your car, the surfactant will help remove
some of that wax you just spent a good amount of time applying.

Liquid waxes use many differing chemistries to gain durability.  Generally, o/w
systems use straight chain polydimethylsiloxane (same stuff in hair
conditioner).  These polymers give a waxed surface the "slippery" feel.  These
PDMS fluids do not last long by themselves without help from a wax.  Carnauba
wax is chosen for its many wonderful properties.

Liquid waxes that are w/o emulsions are usually the better product to use.
This is because of the polymers that are used to make a durable product.  W/O
emulsions will generally use aminofunctional silicones (or similar raw
materials) as the raw material to increase durability.  The silicones are
moisture curing (meaning that water will start the chemical reaction of the
silicones).  These liquid products are hard to formulate since water has to be
kept away from the silicones so they do not react in the bottle giving you a
bottle of glue.  These amino silicones do not really bond to  the paint of your
car (only through hydrogen bonding which in this case is a weak bond)  What
these silicones do is extend their chain length and form a film over the
surface of your paint.  It usually takes 24-48 hours for the polymer to fully
form with the silicone in this product "blooming" to the surface.  What this
means is that right after you wax your car with this type of product, it will
not bead water very well but after 24-48 hours it will bead water extremely
well - this is "blooming".  Example of products with this type of chemistry
usually say "..reactive chemistry" somewhere in blurbage.  The problem with
this type of product is that once again, surfactants are used to make the
emulsion.

Paste waxes come one of two different ways - emulsion paste (pre-softened
paste) and solvent paste (hard paste).  If you include containing abrasives/no
abrasives I guess that you can have 4 products.  Emulsion paste waxes are
fairly similar to  the liquid versions but thickened (examples would be Rain
Dance Paste Wax, Turtle Wax Paste, Armor All Paste etc...).  Most of them are
o/w since thickeners are readily available to thicken water to the required
viscosity and thickener to thicken oil are not as available or require vast
quantities to work (i.e. very expensive).

Solvent paste waxes are unique.  Many different chemistries can be involved in
these product types.  Suffice it to say that most are fairly similar.  The
solvent paste wax formulations are the only way to get sufficient quantities of
a wax  into a product.  Some examples of a solvent paste wax would be Zymols in
the clear containers, Meguiars #26 Yellow Wax, Colonite #870 etc...  3M's new
paste contains a polymer that is truly unique.  We have taken a polymer
(similar to your paint polymers) and grafted a silicone and a flouroploymer
onto it.  This gives good dirt release with the silicone and great oil release
with the flouropolymer.  This product does bond to the surface of you paint and
provides excellent protection.

6.  What products do I recommend?  I really believe in the 3M Perfect-It Foam
Pad Glaze used with either the rotary buffer or by hand.  It is very expensive
to buy but will last many years.  As far as waxes - whatever suits your fancy.
Wax is such a personal thing and the success of using the wax is very dependent
on the condition and temperature of your paint while applying the wax.  I
really like the Zymol for it's ease of use but do not like it's durability or
cost or advertising gimmicks.  I like to Collonite for it's durability but it
is harder to work with.  I especially like the 3M product since it was
developed according to my tastes on my car (this could be slightly biased
however).

Once again, sorry about the length and the plug for the 3M products.  I am not
selling the products but am passing on information learned from years of
developing car care products.

Also, 3M sales reps will come to your Porsche club and give paint care seminars
- give them a call.
