The standard 968 has two blowers. Other models such as 968 CS and turbo
models had only one, which I believe was the smaller of the two (no a/c
either). What you are experiencing is one of these blowers cutting out.
I dont know why but I hope that this is a help in some way.
Richard.

Hello,

During acceleration (moderate through full throttle), my A/C or A/C fan
seems to slows to a speed about equal to 1 on the dial.  As soon as I
resume a crusing speed or slow to minimal throttle the A/C blows with
the
correct force again.  I called the dealer this morning and he seemed to
think something was definitely wrong.  I know I do have some sort of
loose belt around 1500-2000 rpm.  Has anyone had this type of problem?
 Is it possible that they are related in any way.
