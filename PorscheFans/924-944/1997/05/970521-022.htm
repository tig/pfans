        For less than $40 I made two sets of perfect ignition wires for my 
     951. Read the faqs but forget about trying to reuse the brass treaded 
     ends of the wires. Instead buy new ones from :

     If I remember correctly, you get 20 ends for well under $20. Simply 
     crimp them on to some high-quality steel or copper-cored wires and 
     then thread into your stock connectors. The factory connectors contain 
     the resistors, thats why you use solid wires. Using a resistor wire is 
     less than ideal because any resister wire has a level of resistance 
     per foot. Therefore the #4 cylinder will receive a lower voltage than 
     #1. I went to my local speedshop and bought the best universal 
     8-cylinder set of copper wires for $9.00. (pretty yellow ones) they 
     were 8mm Mallory wires. I made up a set of wires in less than an hour 
     and had enough wires and connectors left over to build another set. 
     Some spray silicone makes removing your old connectors and fitting 8mm 
     wires into the 7mm connectors much easier. Sticking with 7mm wires 
     makes the job alot easier, but 8mm wires will work and are an upgrade 
     over the factory wires.   I have no affiliation with BAUM tools.
