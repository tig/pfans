Paul foster wrote about breaking two steel control arms while
autocrossing and using 28MM Weltmeister bars.  As he found out, these
arms were probably already cracked and had been that way for some time.
These Weltmeister bars are wonderful, but they do put a great deal of
stress on the arms where the drop link fastens on.  I would recommend
for anyone running thick bars on a 924/944 to strengthen the arms.  This
should be done not only along the seams, but also a plate should be
welded on around the hole area for the pickup of the drop link.  It
really is very easy.  Do it right once, not after you start to find
cracks.

Another area that should be checked quite frequently and that you won't
find until it is too late (and expensive) is the area where the large
steel plate bolts to the frame on the Weltmeisters.  The two 8mm bolts
that help hold it in place can bend or rip right out of the frame.  For
you serious autocrossers/racers, this area should be strenghtened with
steel plates before it goes bad (much easier to do earlier than later).
