I bet if you hook that CB to a spectrum analyzer you would find lots and
lots of harmonics floating around.  That is probably the nature of the
beast with those radios.  Check your ground connections under that dash,
but there may be little you can do if your rig is splattering RF all over
the spectrum.

There are handi-talkies that use a higher frequency (VHF) that are far
quieter and produce better range.  I forgot what this new frequency band is
called, but it is designed for public use.

The other option is to upgrade to Amateur Radio.  You can get a no code
license that will allow you to use repeaters to talk all over the place.
It is a whole lot friendlier too.
