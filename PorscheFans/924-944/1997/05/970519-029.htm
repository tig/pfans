	Thanks to everyone who posted advice on rattling rear hatch.
I had to really press down and then jerk up the rear spoiler, to be 
able to reproduce the annoyance. (The main trick was pressing the spoiler
 down). This maneuver saved me about $200 worth of needles as of yet 
rear shock replacement on my 951.
	The collective knowledge is great!
Now if I could find a set of ignition wires at reasonable cost. 
Or may be I should fabricate them?
The procedure described in the FAQs is not clear as to the purpose of 
the small hole to be drilled in the wire end connector, once it is
unscrewed from the spark plug connector and freed from the old wire.
Did someone do a nice job of it? 
What brand of bulk ignition wire did they use, I would think it should
be solid copper conductor?
What part of the wire carries RFI noise supression resistor?

			Thanks Len.
