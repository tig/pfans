I was also beset by an annoying and embarrasing rattle(s)("Pretty car
but it sounds like a piece of junk!!).  Once under the car, I found a
small aluminum heat shield that protects the right motor mount ('86
951).  I removed this shield to see what lay beyond.  I noticed that the
removed shield had been abraded / bend / dinged on its uppermost edge -
where it had been in light but frequent contact with the two-piece heat
shield that protects the oil cooler, etc. from the exhaust
manifold/headers.  I filed off about 3-4mm of damaged aluminum and
reinstalled this small shield, careful to pull it slightly downward as I
tightened its (2, lock-tited) bolts.  
I next went looking for another insidious rattle somehere near the
catalytic converter.  Aha! The thin aluminum heat shield was slightly
touching the cat-con at the very rear (of the cat-con).  I used two
large screwdrivers to reverse bind the aluminum sheet away from the
cat-con about 8-10mm.  The sheet could not return to its former
position. Good enough.  Lowered the car, test drove it and guess what
??? quiet ... very QUIET !!!! NO rattles !!! Like a new car.  Now the
deep, sweet tone of the Powerhaus carbon fiber muffler could be heard
without distrations. What, me embarassed?
