Is it a widely accepted recommendation to run synthetic oil in 944's?  I've
never used a synthetic in any car I've owned but I do swear by Castrol
products.  I just sold an '88 Accord coupe with 205k miles which didn't
burn oil running the entire time on Castrol.  But then again, an Accord
isn't a 944!  

The dealer here recommends using Valvoline 20W-50 Turbo Blend.  I drive
this car daily about 150 miles per week.  I also plan to auto-x and attend
drivers ed events.  I heard years ago that once you start using a
synthetic, its not a good idea to go back to regular oil - could be BS, I
don't know.  

Also,  can a late model oil pan with baffles be installed with the engine
in the car and how many hours would this take?  How much should I expect to
pay for the oil pan?  I definitely believe in this type of oil pan, I had
them made for my MG's I used to auto-x.

TIA
