Hi guys,

I am the current owner of a 928S, but am considering the purchase of a 944
turbo.  I have found that my beloved is costing me lots to maintain, and
have heard that 928s are the worst for expensive parts (especially now that
they are out of production)  for example I am told that regular parts such
as fuel filters etc are triple the price of 911 parts.  So I was wondering
what it costs to maintain a 944 turbo (or 951 as I understand).

eg How long before the motor will need to be rebuilt? (on average, I know
this depends heavily upon service history etc), how about the Turbo?.  Also
your advice on any other items such as brakes (I have been through two sets
of rotors in my 28) and other ancilliaries that is common to the 944/951.

One final question.  I have the workshop manuals for the 28, but I still
find it a hellishly complicated car to work on (I have lots of previous
experience on 'normal' cars, replacing and working on engines, brakes etc)
- Is the 944 comparatively easy to work on for a backyard mechanic?

Thanks for your time guys


Adam
