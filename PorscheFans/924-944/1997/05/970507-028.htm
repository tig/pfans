     1980 924 Turbo (931)
     I bought this car in 1988 with 50K miles on it and was my daily driver 
     for 7 yrs.  until last year I was able to afford a 1982 911SC.    The 
     924T has been sitting next to the house now for a year.  I had driven 
     it every 1-2 months, but now it won't start anymore.  I've been saving 
     it as a project car, but cannot find the time.  Therefore it is finally 
     time to sell.
     
     The good news:
     - a 924T with the sport suspension package.  I think some literature 
     called it a 'S' version.
     - handles very nicely, 4w disk brakes, HD roll bars, 
     - have original sticker from window when new, can FAX if you'd like to 
     see it
     - silver ext., tan/brown int.  - Interior with the "op-art" 
     checkerboard pattern insert between leather edges on seats and doors  
     - 928 style phone dialers, w/ pretty new Nikes
     - garaged whole life except this last year (car cover only).  But is 
     So. Cal. so no freezing, sometimes heat
     - good exhaust manifold (for those who haven't priced them, they are 
     $1,000 new and hard to find).
     - Getrag shifter pattern
     - Blaupunkt radio (with "Porsche" on the cassette opening flap)
     
     The almost as good news
     - needs turbo.  It has been through 3 in its lifetime and is ready for 
     it's 4th.
     - needs a little bit of touch up.  A few dash cracks, very minor body 
     stuff, window regulator.
     - now 150K miles
     - everything else in pretty good shape.
     
     Bottom line is I really liked this car and believe those who discount 
     the 924s aren't really doing any justice to the car.  Anyway, from 
     what I've seen and read this one is a "more special" 931 and I would 
     love to transfer it to the right owner.
