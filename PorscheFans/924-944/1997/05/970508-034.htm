Quite right, IMHO. The Porsche 944-engines have small tolerances and are
well optimized. This is witnessed by the very small amount of 'hot-rod'
parts to this engine, and by the fact that every gizmo that is available
will advertise power gains well within the normal variance withing
engine individuals - around 10-12 HP. This is a clear sign that merely
changing a air filter or a exhaust system will not enhance power from
this engine to a significant level. This is a sure sign of a optimized
engine, where the right parts are in from the start.

So the trim chip is the only reasonable way to go, IMO.          

The term 'blueprinting' was used by me to describe the enormous amount
of work that have to be done to take away those few, very minor
glitches, that even the Porsche factory will allow to remain because of
economy reasons - after all, they build (built, rather) the 944 on a
production line. 

One other reason for doing that blueprinting process over again is
because a chipped engine will probably not be 'new'. That would mean
that tolerances may be off the optimum, especially if the engine is
optimized for power from the beginning and wear may have taken the
engine to larger than optimum clearances. (But probably not out of
allowed tolerances...)    

The combustion chambers will not bee 100 % equalized, the rods and
pistons probably could be even better matched even on a 'new' engine. On
a used (not abused!) engine also valves are worn, rings are worn,
bearings are worn - all this contributes to a slightly less than optimum
engine and will benefit from a skilfull overhaul - hence my use of the
word blueprinting.
