Eric,

        Yes, you can fit 225's on the front.  You've already exceeded the
"recommended" size on your rear rims by the same amount (stock factory rear
tire size on your 86 951 is 225, not 245), and they've worked for you,
right?  I posted a similar question regarding the use of wider tires on the
factory wheels, and almost everyone encouraged the upgrade.  I was also
concerned about any adverse effects on suspension components, but not a
single person had experienced any problems following their switch to wider
tires.
        By the way, did you buy the car with 205/245's?  That seems like an
odd combination--the stagger reminds me of applications more suited toward
911's.
