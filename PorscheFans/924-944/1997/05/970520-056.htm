Hey dudes (is this getting old yet?),

Just wanted to mention that a fellow list members took me up on the offer
to take over my stay at the Caesers Tahoe Hotel.  He has now booked himself
and his wife into the hotel as my brother :)

Just thought I'd let you know so if you had asked for it, it is now gone.
I also think it's pretty cool to have things like this come up where the
reason why you get to meet nice people is the car you drive.

I hope the p-fan listmember and his wife have a lovely time at the hotel.

Farzaan.
