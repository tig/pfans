Hey Mike,



              Seeing cars like this for sale in the US is enough to make a
              strong man weep!  The same car here in the UK would fetch at
              least the same IN POUNDS. (_1 = $1.65).  Couple this to
              petrol cost (1 imperial gallon in UK is $4.50) and I
              seriously consider emigrating.

              Mike

I have been enjoying the 924/944 list for some time now, but will now be
parting company with you to return to the air cooled guys/gals.



          1989 944S2    VIN: WP0AB2943KN451896

          71,000 Miles

          Guards Red with Linen Partial Leather

          Dual Air Bags

          4 Wheel ABS

          Polished Wheels

          3.0 Liter 16 Valve 208HP Engine

          No Accidents, All Original Paint

          Well Maintained, Service Records

          Completely Stock with No Modifications

          Asking $12,900



          The car was originally purchased in Tuscon, AZ. It was dealer
          maintained
at the place of purchase as well as Sun-West Porsche (Phoenix).  I
purchased the car from Scottsdale Porsche/Audi/Jag in July, 1995.  The
previous two owners had all service performed at dealerships, proper
          service records and dealer stamps accompanied the car when I purchased
          it.  I have had all the service during my ownership  performed at
          Stuttgart Southwest (PLUG: Independent shop in Tempe, AZ (602) 968-
          6764.
          I have been very pleased with their knowledge and service, and would
highly recommend them).  The car has been well maintained, has no damage,
and is very clean and original.  Sorry, no M030 or Limited Slip for those
of you who prefer to wear helmets when you drive your Porsches.  I am
selling the car to help finance the purchase of a 911Turbo.  Please Email
          me directly if you would like more info. (please, no flames from you
          water-pumpers on my decision...  Buying and selling a car is enough
          stress already!)
