P-fans:

My wife borrowed my '92 968 coupe this afternoon to go to the mall.  On the
way home, she called me from the car to say that the exclamation mark light
had lit up while driving.  The car was driving fine, she said.  I explained
that that light was just designed to call attention to another specific
warning light, but she said everything else on the dash was normal.  I
thought for a minute, then figured that the light must have malfunctioned and
told her to drive the 15 minutes home.

When she got home I looked at the dash and immediately saw that the temp
needle was in the red and no fans were on.  We turned off the car and let it
cool.  Coolant bubbled around and some dripped out, but it eventually cooled.
 I don't think anything was damaged, since the car could be started later (no
warped aluminum block).  Some coolant was lost, of course.  I swapped the fan
relay from her 92 968 cab, but it made no difference (I did this while it was
still hot enough for the fans to go on).  The fans spin freely.  What else
could this be besides the relay?  A switch?  The car was just in for a new
clutch.  Could the mechanic have loosened something which disconnected a few
days later?  The temp gauge had been acting completely normal until today (in
other words, I hadn't lost one fan before, and now the other went, as far as
I can tell).

It goes back to the dealer on a flatbed tomorrow, unless I hear something
from you folks which I can fix in the meantime.  Please e-mail me directly.

Thanks in advance as always.
