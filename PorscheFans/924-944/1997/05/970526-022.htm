Matt, thank you for your kind letter.  I apologize to you for getting so
angry.  You are correct, we all need to work together, no matter what
the problem might be, because we all can learn from our own mistakes and
successes.  I would be happy to work with you in the future and I am
sure that I can also learn from your information as well.

Don Istook
