I saw this on a black Turbo at a Driver's Ed event a few weeks ago. It is pretty
tough, and looks as though it will do a good job of protecting the surfaces, though
it is unsightly. Looks a bit like snot that has been smeared in a thick film on the
car and left to dry. The owner tells me it comes right off with an intensely focused
water stream.
