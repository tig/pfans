<<I noticed in the most recent Pro Solo II autocross in California that
the
A-Stock class was dominated by a gaggle of 944s:

Jeff Reitmeir     89 Porsche 944 S2        63.56
Bill Buetow       89 Porsche 944S2         64.676
Rex Tener        89 Porsche 944S2         64.930
Stanford Curry  93 Toyota MR2              65.878
Jerry Mouton    85 Porsche Carrera        68.120

I'm wondering if these 944S2s had the "sport" suspension option (M030?).
 I've heard conflicting reports that winner J. Reitmeyer's 944 does not
have
the M030 option.  Is the non-MO30 944S2 the hot set-up for autocrossing
(it
is a little lighter) or is he just a hero driver?  

Any info would be appreciated.>>

All of the fast 944S2 in SCCA autocrossing are M030 cars except Jeff's.
(In this results you provided, I believe Rex Tener was co-driving Jeff's
car. Rex is no slouch either, but he finished nearly 1 1/2 seconds
behind Jeff. Bill Buetow is also a very good driver who has been
competing in 944s for years. His is definitely an M030.)

Jeff is one spectacular 2nd-generation autocrosser. I competed against
him in San Francisco for 2 years and watched him for another 2 years in
another class. He is married to possibly the best woman driver in the
country: Stacy (Lynd) Reitmeier. If you are ever on the left coast when
there is ANY autocross in the SF Bay area, show up and introduce
yourselves. I assure you they will be there!

I would strongly advise getting the M030 if you possibly can. With it,
you can adjust the ride height to whatever you want; one of the FEW
stock cars you can do this legally. (Hint: Lower is better.) Or, you can
go back in time, convince your father-to-be to buy a Porsche repair shop
and be involved in the sport, and then grow up hanging out at events
while your parents competed. Or you could do both and REALLY dominate!

Remember: practice, practice, practice...every day!
