     I have a set of 15 inch TELEPHONE DIALS from my 1985.5 944 that I
would like to send to a new home.  Two of the wheels have been curbed (hey-
by the previous owner) and have a scar apiece on their outer edges.  I am
also missing one center cap.  Other than that they are in great shape (good
clear coat, real shiny, etc.)  The wheels are shod with four P215/60/15
DUNLOP D60 A2's (3 months old, 3500 miles).  You get all this for $500.oo. 
EMAIL me or call 803 522 3714 (South Carolina) if interested.  The wheels
are currently on the car & I am selling to finish financing the restoration
of the wheels that are replacing them, so we'll have to work out the
details of the exchange (I really would rather avoid putting my car on
cinder blocks for any amount of time, funny though that would be).

     . . . ALSO I am having trouble recharging my AC.  I have tried to
charge through every schrader(sp?) valve on the car, and can't manage to
accomplish anything but freezing the can of refrigerant.  Is there some
sort of switch or something that I need to trip or reset or some magic
chant that I am ignorant of?....

     . . . ALSO My power sunroof, like Mr. Lemanek's, will only operate in
one direction. I have tried switching around the microswitches, but that
has no effect.  I am, however, only getting power to one side of the
console switch.  Is this correct?  If you guys can't help I'm afraid I will
be forced to read something in order to straighten this out.

Thanks in advance, 
J. Keith Walters
