A couple of folks bet crates of beer that the upper balance shaft would
freely rotate once released from the belts... not true!...

relax, I don't really want the beer, nor do I believe that this is
neccessarily a  victory of sorts... I can only assume that the balance
shaft is suppossed to spin around freely... mine has to be gently helped
along by hand and will generally hold a given position if left there...

I have a cam and balance shaft seal kit, but was leaning towards not doing
replacing the cam/bal shaft seals, or replacing the head gasket, since only
the valve cover gasket and the oil cooler appear to causes of leaks... the
head gasket seems fine and the balance shaft area is very dry...

? ? ?'s

should the upper bal shaft rotate/spin freely and easily?

if it does not, will a re-seal/assembly cure this and should it be performed?

+ + + somewhat related

also, I got a flywheel lock just in case, but so far, I have been able to
remove the balance shaft belt over the crankshaft and power steering
pulleys... can I remove the timing belt this way also? can I install them
over these two pulleys?

I dread life if I have to pull the crankshaft pulley bolt...

thanks...
