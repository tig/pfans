For the type of r-d I described, yes.  But read further.

Okay, there are two types of receiver-driers used in the industry (not
sure about cars specifically though).  There is a r-d that can be used in
the liquid line side (between the condensor coil and evaporator coil) or
the suction side (gas side) between the evaporator coil and the
compressor.  Now that I think about it some more, the one most prevelant
in car systems is probably the one between the condensor and evaporator
coils.  I say this because most car manuals talk about looking into the
sight glass and seeing if you see bubbles (gas) present in the liquid
line.  If so, most likely you are low on refrigerant.

Yes, the expansion valve (txv) or a metering device of something is used 
in cars at the beginning of the evaporator coil.  But what I was 
describing was a hole in this suction tube in the r-d that would allow a 
metered amount of oil back to the compressor as it may accumulate at the 
bottom of the r-d and never get back to the compressor since it would 
never become a gas and return that way.  I meant "metered" hole as in 
predetermined hole size.
