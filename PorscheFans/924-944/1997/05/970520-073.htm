Bolt your ground wire to an existing body bolt.  I think I used one of 
the rear seatbelt anchor mounting bolts.  I inserted the wire under the 
washer, then retorqued the bolt to spec.  Use the most convenient 
location for your situation, and be sure to remove the paint under the 
bolt so the wire makes good contact.  Should you be concerned with 
corrosion, just apply some electrical or battery terminal grease.

I am personally against drilling holes - the fuel tank is right under the 
floor, and road debris, including water, can contact the bare metal, now
breached of its anti-corrosion properties.
