Hi "exhaustgurus",

I found out yesterday from my mechanic that my number 2 cylinder header pipe has a crack underneath the heat shielding. And if you look at it, you can see a thin streak of exhaust dust comning out from underneath the heat shield. The car is a '86 951.
There are two alternativs:

1. Removing the header, welding (which is hard since it's stainless steel), and reinstalling hoping the stress fracture will not get worse.

2. Finding a good set of used headers and installing them (since new ones are about $1,600).

Both jobs would be about 5 hours worth of labour.

Does anyone has any experience of this procedure? It is supposed to be a fairly common problem.

BTW. I do have the newer, updated "accordian" (sp?) type of headers. If I was to do this myself, how hard is it? I assume you should always replace all gaskets and donuts. Do you use anti-seize compound on the bolts? Any special tricks?

Thanks in advance,

Carl
