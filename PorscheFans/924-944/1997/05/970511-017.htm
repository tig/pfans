One more thing, when troubleshooting this one:

The latch mechanism for the hatch (hatchlatch?) is prone to collect dirt
and dust. This, over time, transforms any grease on and in them to
slow-motion grease and it seems that sometimes the latch grips unevenly,
on one side only or not as positive as one would wish. It may be a good
idea to check this area (hatchlatchwatch?) condition, and if suspect,
clean them. This would be a place where dry teflon lubricant may be
useful.
