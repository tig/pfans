Flames:
"A left to the waterpump, a right to the headgasket, a swift kick to the
ball joints......".  Whoa!  Being relegated to reading the archives (tossed
off the list and unable to get back on) makes for some interesting reading
without being able to respond.  Jason, nice to see your apology, but you
shouldn't of ripped Farzan a new one in the first place.  I've learned (by
having my teeth kicked in) that if I think I have penned a gem, it is best
to let it sit for a few days.  When I go back and reread it, the meaning is
sometimes not as I intended so I rewrite.
Farzan has a passion for cars and driving that is rare and a pleasure to
read.  You both have a great deal of practical and technical knowledge that
the list would be poorer without.  Disagree with technical facts and leave
the flames for the air cooled boys. 

Having no tracking problems with either my 16s or 17s, I would suspect
tires.  I'd like to learn more about the OZ wheels.  How they are
manufactured, comparative weights, available sizes, styles and pricing
range.

Blueprinting:
Blueprinting as I understand it, is the specifications that the engine was
originally designed to.  In the real world, these specifications sometimes
change due to manufacturing constraints and costs.  A case in point is the
intake ports on the head and manifold.  In accordance with the blue print,
they should match the gasket.  In reality, Porsche included, they do not. 
Hence, we have a cottage industry doing porting and polishing, port
matching and flow bench porting.  How much good it does probably shows up
better on a drag strip than a track but I still vote for blueprinting.

Headgasket:
Being a two time loser with headgaskets blowing on the #4 cylinder, someone
else's post about blowing #4 was intriguing.  If anyone else out there has
blown a headgasket and lived to tell about it, which cylinder went south? 

$troker:
For those of you who asked, my explodeo 951 is on the road to recovery. 
The only good part about this is it is being fixed under warranty.   I'll
write a detailed post shortly.  In a nut shell, the headgasket blew at
about 7000 rpm (big oil slick on the track).  It vented into the oil galley
rather than the usual water jacket.  The welch (oil galley) plug blew out
of the back of the block.  The handy dandy Accusump helped pump about 13
quarts of oil onto the exhaust pipe and tires.  A quick spin and the engine
was saved with two quarts left in the pan.  Tech Tip:  The experimental
machined o'ring on the cylinder liners appears to be no bueno as a fix.  To
date the head has been machined and stainless o'rings installed.  The stock
oil galley plug has been replaced with a threaded plug.  The freeze plug in
the back of the head has been replaced with a 90 degree fitting which runs
to the water pump for increased flow to #4.  If the new custom copper head
gasket arrives next week, I plan to run the red beast at an auto-x on the
18th.  No,
I'm not getting any smarter.
