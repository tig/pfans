Hello,

I've read with interest the many recommendations for 15/50 oil in Porsche
4-series cars including the 951.   One person ever went so far as to say
that the reason Chrysler recommended 10/30 was that they didn't car much
for their motors...  I'm paraphrasing, but it got me thinking.

In speaking about this with a biochemist / lubricant specialist under
contract toTribol, who worked with the Penske organization a while ago for
Pennzoil racing applications, he was amused.  Why?  His feeling was that
the penchant for 15/50 oil comes from a long held belief that "thicker"
oils are more protective. (His words, not mine.) He says twenty years ago
that may have been true, but recent changes in chemical compounds, the
introduction of synthetics, and closer engine tolerances should all be
cause for serious reflection on the type of oil one uses. His experience
with lubricity, shear factors, and all around oiling performance
capabilities indicates that 10/30 synthetics are better suited to high
performance applications, especially in tubocharged motors.  Bearing
failure is usually the most common sign of poor oiling or improper oil
application.  A 10/30 will flow more easily than a 15/50, and can therefor
do a better job of interposing itself as a film in places of tight
tolerance, such as rod bearings and turbos.

My question then to him was, If the oil is kept clean and changed
regularly, why should we use a 15/50?  His answer was that we shouldn't,
unless we value engine compression over lubricity. Then again, he said the
difference for those who don't put their car on the track is not
significant, until you talk about cold weather performance.

I'm new to this list, and only offer this information as another opinion.
Take it for what it's worth.
