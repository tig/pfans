There are no disadvantages except weight.  The 17" replica wheels weigh
more than the anodized "S" wheels.  But, I've found no performance degradation
running the 17's.  The SP8000 tires feel great too.

Don't throw them away :)  The stock rims are quite a nice unit.  They
are forged from what I understand and are extremely light.  DO NOT SELL
THEM.  Keep them, stick on a set of R1 tires and come racing with us :)
