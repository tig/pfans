Naweed,

I think about it all the time. However, the collective wisdom on this list
is mixed about whether the newer chips offer superior performance to the
older type that used shims and a drilled cycling valve. There was a thread
about a year ago which discussed the AutoThority chips vs. the Weltmeister
(Dinan) chips. I didn't see a clear winner after all the opinions were
posted, and some people indicated that John Milledge was the maker of my
original chips (for Automotion) and that those may have offered the best
performance. I still don't know, but I'll save my money for the time being.

Mike
