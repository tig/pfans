Thanks for the great advice we all get from you on this list.Sounds like an
easy proceedure. What about the cam chain itself? Is there a maintenance
schedule for their replacement? Cost? Is it in the backyard mechanic relm of
fixes?
While I have you here, I've got another question I would like to pose. Why
didn't the 16 valve motor go over as big as I thought it should have? Was it
that much more expensive than the 8 valve? Was the additional expense not
worth the additional performance? I don't know how many were produced, but
there don't seem to be too many of them around. Could the turbo have been the
reason?
