Just a quick note to let you all know that my 924 is now fixed. I was
experiencing a lack of power problem. I had changed virtually all the fuel
system including the petrol tank. Eventually I took the car to Porschembri Near
Heathrow (England). They soon found the problem, the injectors were blocked and
needed cleaning. They were cleaned a few months ago however, the petrol tank
was full of rust at that stage and I guess they just clogged-up again.

Anyone living in the London area who is fed-up of paying AFN prices, contact
Porschembi 0181 577 9520 their labour charges are very reasonable and they are
extreamly helpful.

They specialise in Porsche,and also work on Aston Martins, Jesens... to name a
few. In addition, they also do MOT's
