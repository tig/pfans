        I have a lot of sympathy for you and others who share your opinion
for our men in blue.  I have kind of a love/hate relationship with cops
myself.  I love them all and have a lot of respect for what they do, but
they can very intimidating and unnecessarily difficult at times.  I've found
that initiating normal conversation with both on- and off-duty police
officers can help alleviate the stress and anxiety of dealing with them
under more "official" circumstances.  I bet they probably feel lonely and
somewhat alienated (but they may not admit it) with the understanding that
they're probably not the most popular people in the world, but if you treat
them like humans, they will treat you like one too.  But I'm not denying the
existence of those few arrogant and opinionated overseer-like cops who enjoy
using their power and authority to harass and take advantage of normal citizens.
        Always remember that we have more power than they do, because we are
the ones who have granted them their authority in the first place.  There
should be no reason for you to get nervous around cops if you truly haven't
done anything wrong, and the fact that you do get nervous indicates that
there IS a problem with American cops' attitudes as they are perceived
today.  They are supposed to be protectors of the people, for crying out
loud!  We're definitely not paying them to scare us into following the law.
Although, I have to admit that the initial dread and mixed feeling of
surprise when you see those blue lights in your rear-view mirror can be an
exhilarating experience... especially when it's for "free" and you have to
smile and sigh in relief because the cop is actually pulling over the
Corvette way ahead of you!  :)
