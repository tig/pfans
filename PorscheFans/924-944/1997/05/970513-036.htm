or, also in Atlanta, Georgia 400, the real Darlington of the South...
thousands upon thousands of lady real estate agents in kickin Q45s and
large engined Mercedes all pushin into the 80s... you can cruise 85mph on
this road not pass folks en masse...

I dropped my girlfriend off at work one morning way up 400 north on my
motorcycle, and on the return trip (I like to sleep late, I was rushing
back to bed) I was doing a rock solid 95mph  (kinda nappin on the gas tank)
for quite a few mintues... BLAM BLAAAAHHHHHHHH BLAAAAHHHHHHHH this HUGE
purple and yellow tow truck takes the to the inside with a move and blows
past at at least 110-115mph, 120 does not seem impossible, this dude was
moving that tow truck in a major way... I was on a piddly BMW K75s... after
that Stephen King "The Lakers Tow Truck" experience I think I stayed up and
mowed the yard or something...

this is one outrageous road...
