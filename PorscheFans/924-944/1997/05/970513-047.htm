Subject: Cracked sidewalls on BFG R1's (long story)


> I was wondering if anybody has had any problems with BFG R1 tires purchased
> around 7/96.  I purchased a set of 4 last year in July.  When I got them, I
> noticed that the rubber on the sidewalls was discolored in certain areas (not
> dark black like the rest of the tire).  I called the dealer who sold them to
> me and told them.  I was told that this was common and the tires were ok.
>  This was my 4th set of R1's, not including the set that was on the car when
> I bought it and have never seen this before.
> 
> I used the tires once at Bridgehampton in August, 96, then once at Lime Rock
> last month.  In between, I used them a limited amount on the street, just so
> they weren't sitting for extended periods of time (they were stored in a
> heated garage that never goes below 50 or 55 degrees).
> 
> Last weekend, I took the race tires off and put my street tires back on (I
> have two sets of identical Fuchs).  I noticed that the side walls of all 4
> tires have cracks all the way around.  The cracks are concentric with the
> tire, about 1/2 to 1 inch below the tread level.
> 
> I called Team T/A and told them the story.  The rep put me through to an
> engineer who asked me questions about tire size, wheel size, pressures, etc.
>  After our discussion, he said that I did nothing wrong and it sounded like
> the tires should not have cracked.  He also said that the crack location is
> exactly where the tread is bonded to the sidewall and it sounds like there
> was a problem with the bond.
> 
> So I asked him what BFG would do for me.  He said that they don't have to do
> anything since the competition tires are not under any warrantee and that I
> should just buy another set of tires.  So even though it was suggested that
> the tires were defective (of course they wouldn't actually say that), I am
> out $600, plus mounting & balancing, for 2 days of track time.
> 
> He said that he would have Doug Sanders (the Team T/A guy) call me, but I
> have not heard anything back.  So I guess their problem is my loss.  Not that
> I expected a refund, but maybe a pro-rated discount based on wear or
> something like that.  They never even said "sorry" or at least sounded
> sympathetic to the problem.  Hell, they didn't even seem concerned that I was
> on a race track with 4 faulty tires.
> 
> Has anybody else ever had any problems with R1 tires?  If so, when were they
> purchased and what was the outcome of the situation?
> 
> I guess I'm just disappointed because I planned on this set lasting me the
> season (about another 4-5 days) and if I buy another set, then I can't afford
> to go to the track anyway :(  I already spent my money getting the car ready
> for this year (brakes, rotors, clutch, wheel bearings, etc).  Oh well.  If I
> do buy another set, I think I'll have a hard time coughing up the money for
> BFG's.  Any other brands that people have been happy with?
> 
> Sorry for the bandwidth, but I'd be interested to find out if there were
> other problems.

> 1980 911SC - back to street tires (also BFG's - I feel used).
