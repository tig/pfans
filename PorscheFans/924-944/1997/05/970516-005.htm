Someone asked about preferred settings for the eight position knob on the
DME, with the implication that this could be used to improve performance.
Unfortunately, any setting besides the base position, fully
counter-clockwise, can only take away performance. 

In all the DME's I have looked at, the first position adds a small amount
of fuel above a certain RPM. The next two positions either add more fuel
or take out a small amount of fuel. 

Position four retards the timing, and positions five through eight repeat
the first fuel changes with the ignition retard.

I have experience tuning just about every Porsche, BMW and VW that comes
with a chip, and I don't recall any that benefited from "across the board"
tuning changes. Most respond to long sessions on the dyno working through
the RPM range dialing in each point as necessary. Tedious and boring, but
that is what it takes.

The one advantage of newer testing technology is our Mustang dyno, where
we can do repeated acceleration runs, rather than steady-state tuning. We
believe this gives much better real-world results.
