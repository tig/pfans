That would be a good idea to have a list of places where we could get cars
worked on and also include in that list good parts suppliers.

Maybe a new mail list could be created, called something like

"repairs@PorscheFans.com"

or something like that and just list garages, parts suppliers, and any good or
bad experiences.  What does everyone else think of this idea?
