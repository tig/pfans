When checking your fans, check to make sure that the blades are intact. I
started having overheating problems at the end of last summer (not really
overheating but heading that way until I turned the heater on :(  ) Anyway,
summer was over and the cool days were here so I figured I'd had to get a new
radiator or get it recored (I could here the fans working just fine).

To make a long story short, I took my car to a local shop to get the belt
tensioned and they mentioned to  me that the blades on my 2nd fan were gone.
I replaced them and have never had a problem. 

BTW, I now have 2 extra fan motors with no blade if anyone is having motor
problems.
