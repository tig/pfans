Hey dudes,

I came back yesterday from the Knox Mountain Hillclimb in Kelowna, B.C.
It was quite a bit of fun, but I've vowed now, if I'm not running the
hill next year, I'm not going.  The pain of wanting to run it it is
too much to handle if you are watching all the racers having so
much fun.

Some interesting cars there this year.  It was the 40th anniversary so
everyone went all out.  Don Nimmi showed up in his customer's tri-rotor
20B 93-style RX-7.  This thing was quite something.  Fully gutted,
360hp 20B motor built by Racing Beat (non-turbo), 18" qualifying slicks,
big Brembo brakes, etc, etc.  He ran a 2:00.2?? which is would have been
the first time that a street legal car would have run a 2:00 minute run.
But, Keith Law in his turbocharged 510 ran a staggering 1:59.5?? which
is a new record that took 40 years to create.  It was nice to see Keith
break the 2:00 minute barrier, especially since I was an instrumental
part of that run.  (self-bragging warning)  I took some knowledge from
the Talon and passed in on to Keith after watching his car run at a
local autocross.  Keith even used some parts that I sourced through
my old sponsors and it worked great!  Keith's best time before this
year had been 2:02.???

There was a 944/968/5.0L there . . .  What?  That's right, a 944 with
a 5.0L Ford V-8 in it and 968 body panels.  It had a 944 Turbo nose
grafted onto a 944NA body and a widebody 968 rear end grafted on.  Then,
they had a 968 Turbo S wing put on top of the factory wing.  It looked
interesting.  The 5.0L motor had a Whipple Charger on it.  They ran a
very, very fast 2:08 ON STREET TIRES (Dunlop SP8000), but they broke
their transmission on a 1-2nd shift, like blew up the unit from the
sounds of it.  They had this happen before and upgraded the factory
unit, but it looks like they didn't go far enough.  They were doing
full on 4000rpm clutch drops though.  They were from Alberta.

There were many, many other neat cars like the King of the Hill John Haftner
in his purpose built open wheeler trying to beat his own record 1:38,
but he only managed a 1:39 because conditions were not optimal.

My question, has anyone run a 944 Turbo on a hillclimb?  I am taking
the positives and the negatives of building a track car which would be
used in hillclimbs.  I know the Talon AWD would have been a class dominator
if we had run it, but I don't know if the 944T will be very competitive.
The Talon AWD would be cheaper up front, but nowhere near the fun of
the RWD Porsche, not to mention the "ego factor" of running a Porsche
racing car.

We had a hoot on the trip up and back down (about 850km total trip).  Did
about 140-160km/h all the way up and managed to get a ticket for 119km/h
in a 100km/h zone.  The cop was nice though so I won't rant and rave.
On the way back, we had three cars going down and it was a blast.  We kept
speeds down to 140km/h because the other cars had trailers filled with
race tires, etc. on them.  I did get a hood dent from a huge rock that was
hurled from a truck in front, but I'll get it fixed soon.

I really liked the way the car takes a set in high speed corners.  It
just settles down and then lets you feel the road really nicely.  It's
hard to describe, but it just feels very different than any car I've
driven before, it just sits down and zooms around the corner and you
don't have to make any corrections, it just holds its line regardless of
bumps, camber, etc.  Very neat.

Arif Kassam, the dude that was considering trading in his Maserati and
944NA for a turbo popped by while he was in town and Paul took him for
a boot in his 951.  I'm not sure what Arif decided, but I guess we'll
soon find out.

Farzaan "who just laid down the Mastecard for the trip to Germany, so no more
         spending money on the car for a while" Kassam.
