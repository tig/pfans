Take an O-Scope, check at the power leads to the cruise module for RF.
Possible problems:
  1)Power supply (battery) loading at the fuse block so that there is
voltage drop.  Solution -
  Change the location from which you are pulling power for the transmitter.
TX should
  run directly to the battery, nad not through the central electric
distribution box.  Switch to a different
  circuit, run a wire directly to the battery through the
  firewall if possible, properly fused of course.  Make certain the battery
negative has a good, thick
  braid to the chassis from the negative pole.
    Solution 2 - Put a toroid around the power leads going into the cruise
module.
  2)RF getting into dash electronics, is this a real speed change or just
what your speedometer says?
  3)RF getting into speed sensor (assuming that the pickup is electronic
and not mechanical);  I don't know
  what in your year car relays the speed to the computer, an electron or a
spinny mech thing.  If it is an
  electron, consider re-routing the coax away from the center console along
the driver's side dash sill.
     Isn't the computer for ignition located on the passenger side of the
car, basically under the battery?
     RF could be affecting that directly.
Grount the coax for your antenna at one end only.  Ground at the TX end and
leave the other end of the shielding
open and floating.

Dana,
I read your post to the 994 list a while back, and thought you'd be the
expert that would understand my problem completely.  I've got a Kenwood
TM-733a mounted on the passenger side wall next to the glove box.  It's
remote mounted to a plate I made that's located under the stereo.  The
speaker is remoted there to that plate also.  I've got a Larsen
dualbander glass mount antenna who's coax is run covertly down the
console in the middle, then under the back seat to exit just next to the
hatch.   With that said, nothing is even close to the cruise box next to
the driver, but the system still drops 2-3 MPH when I transmit on high
pwr(50w).  Do you have any RF shielding ideas that would cure this
problem, and do you think that this is a dangerous practice to
continue(even thought it slows down, not speeds up)?
TIA,
Michael Robbins
