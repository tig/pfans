Got the note on waxing an automobile and thought I might be able to shed some
insight.

I am/was a product developer for 3M in the Automotive Trades Division.  I am an
inventor of the 3M Hand Glaze among other paint refinishing products.  I own a
Porsche (87' Guards Red, Black/Light Grey interior 951) and had been given the
job of developing the best products for car care.  This is quite a job since
testing usually involves waxing my car on company time while sucking down a
couple of  home brews.  While I am associated with 3M, I offer this advice not
to sell more 3M products but to shed insight into what is commonly perceived to
be "black art" with lots of misinformation floating around.

I must admit that I am surprised at the number of people that use Imperial Hand
Glaze before applying a wax. These products can be incompatible with each other
depending upon the paint type they are being used over - thus the "streaking"
that has been experienced when using any wax over the Hand Glaze. We have found
ways to alleviate this problem in the lab and have developed products to
address it.  Imperial Hand Glaze was developed for the professional body shop
at a time when the best that could be achieved in paint refinishing still left
minor swirl marks that the customer could see when the vehicle was placed in
the sun.  Imperial Hand Glaze filled in these swirls marks with a high
molecular weight mineral oil that lasted until the weather turned really hot or
until the owner washed their vehicle.  To add durability to this product, 3M
Perfect-it Hand Glaze was developed that would last for awhile longer.

Anyway, I have found that in paint refinishing you get exactly what you pay
for.  When using any type of product that will remove paint, it is best to
purchase a high quality product containing a quality aluminum oxide abrasive.
I choose aluminum oxide because it is a manufactured abrasive that can have
tight tolerances in particle size and shape.  The goal is to get the scratch
depth to be 1/2 the wavelength of light or less and this is most easily
accomplished using the aluminum oxides..  When using a natural mineral
(Tripoli, silicon carbide etc...) the "dirt" is ground into various particle
sizes and then screened.  This process is not very accurate.  These minerals
can cost anywhere from $.08 - $0.30/LB vs $0.20/LB - $10.00/LB or more for
aluminum oxide.  The difference in price reflects the particle size
distribution, where the abrasive comes from (Germany, Japan, US - shipping
aluminum oxide is expensive), hardness and surface area of the mineral.  The
more expensive the car care product (at least 3M's), the better quality the
abrasive is.

There are many ways to improve the appearance of a vehicle's finish and it is
dependent upon the condition of the paint to begin with.  The best way to get a
"clean" surface is to use 3M Perfect-It Foam Pad glaze, a foam polishing pad,
with a rotary buffer set at 1800 rpm's (this is not the same "two-handed
polisher that can be bought at Sears for example).  It is  misinformation to
say that you should only rub a cleaning agent back and forth instead of using a
circular motion if the glaze and application tool are chosen carefully.  All
automotive manufacturers (and body shops, import centers etc...) use these
polishers and they work in a circular motion.  It is equally bad to rub back
and forth if the applicator is substandard or the glaze to coarse.   If a
polisher is unavailable (they are expensive and require some know how to
operate), this is still the best product to use by hand requiring more work
than with the machine.  You can tell when the surface is clean when it
squeaks.  Scott paper towels (Wypall or Shop Towels) work the best for
applicators.  Plan on using a roll to do a proper job.

After the paint has been cleaned, use a high quality paste wax.  Waxes that
claim to contain "bee pollen", ultra pure carnauba etc... are just trying to
extract more of your hard earned dollars.  These people that claim to use a
higher percentage of carnauba wax thereby justifying the higher retail prices
are ripping you off.  Carnauba wax only costs $3-5/LB depending on the "color"
of the carnauba - the lighter yellow is more expensive.  If you buy a container
of the "Z" wax, it has 25% or so of carnauba which would be approximately
$1.00/container for the cost of the carnauba.  The rest of the materials are
solvents and silicones and miscellaneous other materials (no "hard" paste wax
is solvent free even thought they are advertised as such) and these are r
elatively inexpensive raw materials.  The paste wax chosen should contain no
abrasives since the paint was cleaned in the previous step.  No need rub hard
to apply or remove since you are only applying an extremely thin layer of wax.
Rubbing the wax by hand is an interesting gimmick but should be avoided.  One
source of streaks comes from uneven pressure on the applicator in which it is
your finger tip outkline that you are seeing in the streak.  Other source of
streaking are caused by amino functional silicones, high molecular silicones
and wet surfaces before waxing with a hard paste wax.  Misting the surface
works good to remove the streaks but most disappear within a few days time if
left to themselves.

I you use a wax that is abrasive free, you will not end up with that nasty
white color in you moldings.  It is the abraisve that is ground into the
moldings that is what you are seeing after waxing and this is very hard to
remove without just covering it up.

Anyway, this is plenty long and I'll probably get flamed because of it.  If
anyone is interested in this subject, I will be glad to share what I have
learned about paint finishing from many years experience developing these
products.  I think 3M even has a web page devoted to paint/car care concerns.
