Fromn what I understand, the water pump problem may be also be a problem
of varying quality. AFAIK, there are water pumps that keep up for a
decent time, and there are water pumps going down real quick. If the
problem is lack of quality or precision in the original casting and
hence bearing and wear related problems, or if the wear problem is
related to the cam belt tension problem is beyond me. That the water
pump is driven by the back of the cam belt is not the most clever design
feature of this setup, thats for sure - it needs unneccesary high
tension therefore, and that feature alone may be the sole reason for the
extremely narrow tension tolerances.

Be what it may, the design have been changed three (I think) times. The
latest have better (sturdier) castings, better seals and a cam
belt/balance belt deflector in stainless steel. This is obviously the
one to get. A rebuilt unit, based on the latest design may not
necessarily be a bad proposition. Basically, the impeller, the bearings
and the shaft seals need to be renewed, and any machining must be true -
but that is old hat for any rebuilding workshop.       

How about some statistical input on lifespan of pumps ? Mine held out
for 190000 km (118 K miles).
