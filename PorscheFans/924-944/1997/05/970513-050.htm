my .02 (street driving only; no track)

A couple of years ago, I had a new BMW K75s motorcycle... I broke it in
with Castrol GTX and then at 15k miles, I switched to Mobil 1... you're not
supposed to break-in motors with synthetics, as you do want that intial
wear, but after that, I believe you can go back to dino if you wanted...

the only thing I could really notice is that the synthetic oil does not
seem to die as rapidly and completely as the dino oil... Castrol (and most
all dino juice oil) gets a certain kinda of beat-up I ain't got no more
viscosity fluid feeling at the end of its life, while the Synthetic seemed
to hold out there at the end...

I honesty thought the synthetic felt thinner in the motor at extended high
revs, but this is supposedly where synthetics really shine, so, although I
personally felt that it did not feel as good as dino- hand on throttle
gunning it to 7000rpm on the motorcycle, it does not mean much, especially
since the dino does seem dead after a while and the synth does not... this
would seem to verify that the synthetic resists overall breakdown better...

I did use 15w-50 synthetic, and if if went back to it, that is the grade I
would use, but for my NA 944, I will probably stick to Castrol GTX 20w-50
since I change the oil frequently enough to discourage me from using $5/qt
oil...

If I had a turbo 944, or if I dogged it harder than I do- I only bust
moves, I don't really let loose for 10 miles straight- or if I even tracked
once a year, I would switch to synthetic...
