Keep in mind that the M3 for European and Australian delivery is a vehicle
far superior to the American variant.  Having driven the 5spd in Oz and
recently moved to the US, I was ready to lay down the cash for the car with
a 6spd sequential shifting gearbox and 300+ horses -- only to find it's the
3.2 litre engine, but severely undernourished and no option for the 6-SS
'box.  Next!
So in many ways, the 968 is considerably more physically and mechanically
attractive -- it has competent road manners and pleasing straight line
performance compared to the US delivered M3.
Of course, nothing compares to the open-throat, purposefull roar of the
Euro spec M3 engine (unless you're in a 911.)
