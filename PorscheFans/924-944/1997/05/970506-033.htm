        This may not be the norm but:

A friend of mine (MY BOSS) was at an track at a PCA Drivers Ed event ( Yes I
know, this is not a timed event.)
He went a bit too hot into a corner, and ended up over the tire wall on the
roof of his once dentless 911. He had the car for less then 4 months. He was
planning on selling that silly car and buying a 951 ( after I let him drive
mine ). The long and short of it is; his insurance company, a major player,
cover his car in full. The lucky guy would not have been able to sell the
car for what he "over paid" for it in the first place. 

The net total from the insurance company was in fact more then he actually
"over paid" for the car.The un-named insurance company paid his claim, but
this same company has refused another persons claim for about the same
money. The unfortunate person who is now in litigation, was with another
region, at a different track.

I think my bosses claim was paid because of the way he handled the insurance
company. He was honest but didn't offer any information that they didn't
need to know. They didn't need to know that he had a roll bar, or he was
using a 5 Point Harness ect. Believe it or not people have told their
insurer about their Roll Bars, Harness System, R1 Tires.... Hello, they
don't need this information!!

Be smart when you are trying to get $$ from an insurance company, remember
they are not a bank.
