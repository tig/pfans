Hi Wes,

I removed the quarter panel interior pieces, then drove my car to a body
shop I do lots of business with. They cut the metal outusing soming (what
I do not know) leavind a very clen and professional look. I then had a
stereo shop fabricate some custom plates out of plastic and installed the
speakers on to the plates. The plates then bolt on to the quarters leaving
a sealed fit

The sound quality is incredible. and I think all told it cost about $350
can.  $275.00 for speakers, $25.00 for body shop, $25.00 for plates and
then our friend Mr. GST.

In the front I am running a set of alpine soft dome tweeters and sony 4"
mids on a custom cross-over. The trick with the 4" speakers up front is to
tuck them behind the door panel and the use good 'old duct tape to seal up
around the speaker.

I have grown out of my Bass-thumpin days so removing the spare tire and
fiberglassing the bin  and installing 4 10" subs was not that apealing to
me.

But I really enjoy the sound of my stereo as it stands. 2 tweeters, 2
mids, 2 drivers, crossover, 2 small amps (2 channel) and a killer alpine
cd head unit and I now have a great car with great sound. 

BTW, total price for labour and parts on my stereo is about $1300 can. not
to bad considering my deck retailed for about $750, got it on sale for
$400.


Anthony
