Not many 968s, maybe some 911/993s and 944s

Do 40#s front & rear to start. Find the novice coordinator. 
They can help mark the tires to see if you need more or less. Your main
focus should be on learning the course. Walk the course as many times as
possible. Getting to the site early will allow more walk throughs and
prep time without rushing.

Correct. There will be a "pits" area where everyone will park and empty
their stuff.

You shouldn't have any starvation problems. I'd run a full tank with the
spare tire not removed, just to help keep the back end down.

Tech inspection is for safety related issues. If the car is well
maintained you should encounter any problems.
