    I take pride in telling people that my 951 is worth almost half 
the price of their brand new Integra. You asked me once Farzaan why I 
bought a 951... well,  what other car offers so much in 
a car less than 20grand Canadian? (Of course, I got more than a 
hundred thousand Ks and a non-S) It's a REAL sports car, a Porsche, 
and excellent value. When people sometimes say to me: You can afford 
a Porsche? I usually ask them how much their car is and tell them the 
fraction of the cost my car is worth. True, the car wasn't worth that 
much brand new... but what matters to me is how much I PAYED for it. 
Usually the only counter argument for owning a 951 is the maintenance 
costs. But maintenance costs are justifiable when considering the 
performance of these  high-output engined car. Don't quote me on 
this, but I assume that most sports cars generally cost more than 
their more mundane counterparts to maintain.
