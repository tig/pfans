Alternatives to chipping your precious Porsche engine.

We have all heard about the ongoing quest for the =

more Powerful Porsche. As an owner of an normally =

aspirated car, I (and my peers) have less gain and =

greater risk than Turbo owners when 'chipping' our =

cars, so we will have to search other ways to the =

Power Grail. But hang on anyway, this may be =

interesting even for Turbo's...

We are hoping to get at least 50 HP extra when chip-
ping an Turbo engine, and maybe 15 HP from a NA 944. =

At least, that is what the chip manufacturers want =

us to think.     =

 =

Lets make a simple prediction of what that may mean, =

mathematically. A reasonable relative performance ra-
tio for comparing performance can be computed by di-
viding weight with horsepower. This will give us a =

numerical value that can be used to predict (pretty =

well) the acceleration potential of any car. There are =

other factors too, that defines =91performance=92, but =

we=92ll save them for another day.       =


My car, a 944 NA 85.5 weighs 2667 pounds and =

stables 164 horses. A Turbo, from the same year (-86) =

weigh 3040 pounds - (a difference of  373 pounds) =

and has 217 HP available.

To make the very best out of this comparison, I use =

a European NA and a US Turbo... , but on the other hand, =

the poor NA can't win anyway, as you will see... :-))       =


This gives us weight/HP ratios for the NA: 16.2, and, =

for the Turbo: 13.9 - a difference of only about  15 %.  =

Now, a lot of people will shout "That cant be true, the =

Turbo is MUCH faster" - and it is, subjectively and =

objectively - but 15 % may be more than you think. =


Now, lets go on. If (a big IF) the US Turbo had weighed
as little as my European 944 we had got a weight/HP ratio
of  12,23 which is 25 % more - and that=92s significant.
That extra 10 % gain would have been virtually free,
both from cost and risk.

Put a chip into a US Turbo, and it will get a ratio of
11.3. If it then had been as light as a NA, it would have =

gone down to 9.9 - and thats a whopping 40 % difference =

to the standard 944 NA, and at that level, we=92re talking...

Now, lets see why my European NA is lighter. For starters, =

it have no power steering. It does not have any AC either. =

Then, the bumpers are somewhat weaker.  Then, the turbo =

hardware have to weigh something, but clearly, it can=92t =

explain 373 pounds.  There could be other differences, =

but this will give us a hint about what those extra comforts
cost us performancewise. To add another backside of these =

gadgets, besides weight penalty, they actually rob the =

engine for power, maybe 2-3 HP. =


Now, not anyone is so obsessed with horsepower that he =

will rip out the powersteering and the air-condition, but =

things add up - be sure of that. Now to some, hopefully, =

useful ideas:

Is there any way the car can be made lighter in an easy way? =


Yes, it is. =


The tank, when it is full, weighs around 160 pounds. Any car =

will run as strongly on the last gallon as on the first of =

every tankful - save at least 120 pounds. =

The windscreen washer tank is huge,  12 pounds of water when =

it is full - save 12 pounds. The spare tire, jack and tools
are not necessary when 'racing' - face it - if you get a flat, =

you have lost anyway...  that=92s 20 pounds.  =


Assuming these weights are correctly estimated (some are) =

we=92ll slim the car with 150 pounds. This will mean the equivalent
of finding a way to rise the power on the engine with 10 %, =

which on my car is 15 HP. On a Turbo it will be around 25 HP... =


Just some food for thought, if you want to make yor car a little quicker
for free... Let me hear what you think!

Cheers
