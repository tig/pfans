Hello all: one of the a/c hoses in my '84 944 has a leak. This is the
long, windey hose from the receiver/dryer to the condensor. The leak is at
the highest stress point where the hose changes from metal to rubber, to
the left of the O2 sensor connector, where it turns at a right angle into
the firewall. It is right next to the intake manifold and probably does
not benefit from the high temps. either. 

Now this was a fairly large hole and it was still difficult to detect. I
am guessing the other 13 yr old hoses are on their way south too. I could
just replace the bad hose, but freon running at 300F exerting 250lbs of
pressure will probably find all the weak points in the other rotting
rubber.

The shop that found the bad hose told me as much: that there were no
guarantees even with a new hose because the most they could check the
system with was Nitrogen at 150lbs. I was also told that there is no way
to repair the hose reliably, because of the pressure and temperature
demands. Inquired at a local hydraulics shop and received the same answer. 

A set of new hoses would cost about as much as a new compressor. Has
anybody on the list successfully had their a/c hoses repaired? Would I be
saving a lot or does it make more sense to bite the bullet? How reliable
is a repair?  Remember, none of the crimps on my hoses are leaking, the
holes are in the rubber. Is the hose I am referring to a common problem
hose, in which case I could risk switching just that one and charging up.
Any names/locations of repair shops would be appreciated also. TIA.
