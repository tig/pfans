Daniel,
       I didn't have the gauge when fixing my '87 engine, so maybe I am
asking for trouble... However, I do believe there is a bit of margin as
to tensioning. The factory manual (if I remember correctly, and I will
look it up again) says to tension a new belt to ~4.2, and after 3k, to
2.7?? I used an iterative approach to setting the tension by releasing
the spring loaded auto-tensioner, setting it by tightening the bolts,
and slowly rotating the crankshaft. My objective was to take up the
slack on the return side of the belt without applying too much tension
on the belt. After a couple of cranks around, and re-setting the
auto-tensioner, I got it to a point where the drive and return side of
the belt were about the same. I set the balance shaft belt by hand. I
checked them after 500 miles, and everything was ok. For the first
50-100 miles, there was a slight wine, but that has gone away. I guess
time will tell, but I personally am not too worried about the belts.
Maybe I am being too cavalier about this? Has anyone had actual problems
with the auto-tensioner?
