This is true. However, the higher the octance rating, the more resistant 
the fuel is to detonation.

For a modern, computer controlled car with knock detection, you will
never hear pinging. The computer will retard ignition far enough to
prevent detonation. In this case, using a lower octane fuel will cause 
a decrease in performance. You won't hear any pinging because the computer
will protect the motor, but you will lose HP. 

All turbochargeed engines should use high octane fuel. The additional
combustion chamber pressure requires a detonation resistant fuel.

To determine which grade of fuel to use, read your owners manual.
That should tell you what octane fuel to run.
