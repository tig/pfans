Start with the flywheel/clutch housing marks, and get them DEAD ON.

Line it up as close as you can after the flywheel is aligned.   If you end
up being 
a small amount off (less than a tooth), you will be fine.

After the timing belt alignment and tensioning are DONE, then return the
engine to tdc (flywheel perfectly aligned), and tackle the balance shafts.
They should be essentially DEAD ON, not one or two teeth off or you will
definitely feel it.   Balance shafts will sometimes fool you by look fine until
you rotate the engine, and then be off.   I f that happens, go with the one
that is aligned, loosen the belt, and spin the other into alignment.   Don't
settle for a tooth off.

NO.   Use the flywheel.   It is more precise.

You will do fine, Dan.   I presume you have LE TOOL?
