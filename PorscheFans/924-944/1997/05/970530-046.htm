Hi group,

I really think what you guys are doing is great.  I hope you can help me 
I just had all my belts,water pump, motor mounts, changed at a garage.
They are located quite a distance away so I'm trying to avoid having to
take the car back if the fix is simple.  My problem is my right cooling
fan would not shut off when I brought the car back from the garage.  I
disconnected the thermoswitch for the fan in the radiator and the fan
still continues to run even with the switch unplugged.  I had to unhook
the battery to make the fan stop.  Oh, by the way I hooked the battery
back up to check it later and the alarm horn blew.  Will that eventually
stop and reset it self when I connect the battery or does it need to be
reset manually? TIA
