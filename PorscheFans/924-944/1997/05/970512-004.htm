doesnt such a thing exist??? i could have sworn i saw such a thing on the P-Fans 
net site.  I have this feeling that most of us dont want to hear the petty 
arguments that go on especially when they turn ugly, as they have in the past on 
a few occasions.

if two people want to fight it out on the comp. then cant they e-mail each other 
direct and not waste bandwidth and the time that most of you dont have?  this 
seems obvious because each flame requires a response and so on and so on.  this 
message shouldnt even have to be written and there shouldnt be a need for a 
patrol to keep these arguments away, let better judgement prevail and for the 
love of God if you disagree could you do it politely???

your friendly porsche driving college student,
matt

p.s. i am not trying to be a mommy just to stop some of the insanity and i bet 
most of you agree!!!
