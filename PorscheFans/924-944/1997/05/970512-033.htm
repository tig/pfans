I was wondering if anyone has considered the role different tire pressures
may play in all of this (with respect to same wheels/different tires;
obviously a pressure change may accompany a switch to taller/wider wheels).
I'm not an expert on tire dynamics, but would it be safe to assume that the
softer, mushy tire (I guess that invovles the rubber compound as well) would
absorb bumps and road imperfections better than the rock-hard, 55 psi tire
whose direction is altered by every little groove?  When rolled, a
playground ball will keep its direction a lot better than the basketball
that squirts to the right after grazing a piece of gravel (assuming similar
masses, of course).
