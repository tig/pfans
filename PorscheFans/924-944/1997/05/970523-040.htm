WELCOME TO VIRGINIA!!!  I live with this day-in day-out.  Your mad? 
Irritated? Pissed off?  Feel like you were "just passing through" and
got nailed??  You were actually lucky. In Arlington County (just outside
DC) they take the detector AND you get a moving violation (one point on
your license so your insurance rates can go up 30-50%).  You NEVER see
your detector again.


Radar detectors are illegal in D.C. and Virginia.  I live in Maryland
but drive through DC and Va. all the time and have had two detectors
snapped up (forgot to pull them out of the window) One time at a red
light a "protector of our freedoms" (and ourselves) walked up to my
window and just asked me for the detector.  Never saw it again.

Your fighting city hall here buddy.....you already lost.  You do
anything clever and you WILL REGRET IT.  Count your blessings and go on
with your life.  Thank God you live in N.C.     Mike Cecchini
