     Seeing cars like this for sale in the US is enough to make a strong 
     man weep!  The same car here in the UK would fetch at least the same 
     IN POUNDS. (_1 = $1.65).  Couple this to petrol cost (1 imperial 
     gallon in UK is $4.50) and I seriously consider emigrating.

I have been enjoying the 924/944 list for some time now, but will now be 
parting company with you to return to the air cooled guys/gals.

The car was originally purchased in Tuscon, AZ. It was dealer maintained 
at the place of purchase as well as Sun-West Porsche (Phoenix).  I 
purchased the car from Scottsdale Porsche/Audi/Jag in July, 1995.  The 
previous two owners had all service performed at dealerships, proper 
service records and dealer stamps accompanied the car when I purchased 
it.  I have had all the service during my ownership  performed at 
Stuttgart Southwest (PLUG: Independent shop in Tempe, AZ (602) 968-6764. 
I have been very pleased with their knowledge and service, and would 
highly recommend them).  The car has been well maintained, has no damage, 
and is very clean and original.  Sorry, no M030 or Limited Slip for those 
of you who prefer to wear helmets when you drive your Porsches.  I am 
selling the car to help finance the purchase of a 911Turbo.  Please Email 
me directly if you would like more info. (please, no flames from you 
water-pumpers on my decision...  Buying and selling a car is enough 
stress already!)
