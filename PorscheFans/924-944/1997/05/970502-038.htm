I'm no Porsche expert, but anything like that much free play in a drive shaft is a worry.  sounds like applying the brake is 'tensioning' the driveline to take up the free play which may be arising in a CV joint by the sound of it.

Is the Yak walking, standing, or sitting?  If it's walking, I think a fuel delivery problem, if it's standing but not walking, I think an ignition advance problem, if it's sitting, but get's up once you're above 3500 and walks, try offering it a bigger carrot on a shorter stick.


This could be a million causes.  Maybe hesitation at mid-range under load is a knock sensor and timing problem.  If it's running strong at higher revs, that tends to exclude bad ignition (failed high tension) and fuel delivery (bad pump, lines etc) so without first hand contact -- who knows?  My first guess is you've got one bad injector.

Indeed.  Automotion seems to charge like a wounded Yak.
