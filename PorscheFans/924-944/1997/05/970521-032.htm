Just about all these questions are answered in your owner's manual.  Did 
you get one?  If not, you really must get one.

You should read the 944 FAQ (Mandatory for all 944/51 owners!) at 
http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html

Our fabulous cars do have a few weak points that must be addressed right 
away, especially if you don't have records from the previous owner.  Most 
critical are the timing/balance shaft belt changes and retensioning, 
along with the water pump.

I use 20w50 year round - but in Oregon it rarely gets below freezing in 
winter.  The manual gives an outside temperature range for that viscosity 
from about 18 degrees F to off the scale hot.  A 5w10 synthetic is good 
year-round in any climate.

Whatever feels comfortable, but probably between 3000 - 4000 to prevent 
lugging in the next gear, and leave the engine with enough revs to give 
you reasonable power.  Remember the 16v engine really comes alive above 
4000.

That button overrides all climate control settings, and gives you maximum 
defrost power.  It will also engage the A/C compressor to help dehumidify 
the air and clear the windows.  Interior fan goes to full speed, and 
defrost flaps open all the way.

The fan runs all the time.  This is normal, as (1) keeps ventilation 
going in case you have an exhuast leak into the cabin and (2) pulls air 
over the interior temperature sensor for the climate control.

Yes.

Porcshe added this weight to counteract resonances in the body structure 
of the cabriolet, due to loss of body stiffness.
