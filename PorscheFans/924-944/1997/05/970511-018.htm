This is a question of much controversy. While a clean and spotless
engine is a pride and joy for any Porsche fellow, a very thorough
*cleaning* may have drawbacks not completely understood by all car
detailers.

When doing a engine bay use of degreasers, hot steam cleaning and/or a
high pressure water jet give good results for cleaning, too good
sometimes.
Most, if not all, of the wanted oil and grease goes off with the grime
and therefore some lubrication of certain points in the engine bay is
necessary.
This would include the spring hatchlock, the headlamp linkage, the gas
wire, the linkage for cruise controland and the hatch hinges. Ideally,
some engine parts should be covered, among them the brake fluid
reservoir. If you are very paranoid, a quick check of the air filter box
may be good, too.

Now, why is the engine dirty, in the first place. My 130 K miles, 11
year old is not dirty at all, except on places where oil accumulates and
act like dust glue. So any accumulation of dirt may be a sign that there
is a leakage somewhere. It is hard to not get oil on the gravel shield
and oil cooler ass'y when changing oil and that will in due time mean
all the engine bottom end, if it is not cleaned off. It is not hard to
take off the gravel shield, and a lot of stuff that needs a checkout at
oil changes is far easier to reach when that part is taken away.

Now, a good time to look for any leaks will be immediately after such a
cleaning session, and then my advice would be to just not let the engine
get dirty again (some tip, huh?)...
