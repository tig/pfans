After one unsuccesful attempt to straighten my bent 951 front wheels ($125 at
Collison repair), I decided to upgrade the looks of my 1986 Turbo and
hopefully solve my vibration problem at 62+ mph.

After extensive research, narrowed my selection (not that many are available)
down to ROH (from Discount Tire Direct), and decided to check their website.
 Well, prices on website were $120 less (for four) which I mentioned to the
sales guy, no problem we will give you that price, what was it again?? Tells
you something about their profit margins.  Anyway, got the new wheels in
about 10 days, put them on that night and Viola, no more vibration.  And the
improved look is awesome, no Porsche emblem in the center, but they look so
good-best money spent so far.  

These are the ROH reflex and total price with shipping (to NY) was $774, and
no sales tax!!  They are five straight spokes (standard finish) and now the
brake calipers show through nicely.  Cleaned them up with engine degreaser
and sanded down the porsche name, what a look.  Now I spend more time looking
at my car then before.

BTW, don't overlook the nuts and socket that come with them, as the Porsche
lugs will not fit!!
