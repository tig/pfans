Anders & Wes,

Thanks for explaining the basic principal.   But I fear that you 'may' have 
missed the point (only a little) and some of the major advantages.  Please 
keep an opened mind and allow me to elaborate.

While an email-list, like this one, allows "some" good focus, it still 
lacks the ability to select archives on a particular subject.  Keep in 
mind, I am not talking about adding a news group to he 50,000+ ones already 
out there on the uunet servers.  My intent is to bring up a stand alone 
news server.  This would allow us, the Porsche owner/users, to define as 
many specific groups as needed and/or appreciate.  Imagine a news server 
that had only Porsche information and 50 or so categories. Allow me to list 
a few off the top of my head:

951.clutch
951.preventitive.maintenence
951.turbo
944.bodywork
944.brakes
944s.values
944.stereo.placement
944.preformence.enhacments
944.preformence.problems

Sorry, I am a bit focused on 951s since that is what I own.

Each of these groups would keep the postings indefinitely (or until I run 
out of disk space, on an 18GB server).  This would allow us to access 
information as we needed it, rather than having to constantly read emails 
for fear of missing something of value.  It would also allow new users to 
see postings which may be relevant to them, but a year old.

I have to admit I am a bit puzzled.  Since my original message, I have only 
received 9 messages. I am not sure if this is due to lack of interest or 
lack of understanding of my proposal.  I realize that I did not explain it 
in  any degree of detail, that was by intent.  I wanted to see what the 
level of understanding out there was.  As a result of my puzzlement I will 
take the following action. I will create a web page that has a link to the 
PorscheNews server (as soon as I create it).  This will allow anyone that 
has Netscape or InterNet Explorer to access it with only a click (I think?) 
 AOL users I don't know about.  I do not have AOL and do not know its 
limitations.   If I see a useful level of access I will leave it up, if not 
.. .  well you get the point.

I asked the question in the first place because it won't do any good of no 
one uses it.  So I guess we will test the theory.

Give me a day or two and then check -

http://208.214.76.50/porsche/

I will post the above mentioned web page there.  I will also post a message 
here when it is up.


Respectfully,

A newserver is (in principle) integrated in the Usenet. Usenet is the
place for all kinds of NG's (newsgroups), such as rec.autos.misc and
alt.autos.porsche just to name a few.

Just about any of man's weird, unusual or strange interests will have
its own newsgroup, just like the more universal ones, like cars,
computers and all kindd of hobbies.

This may sound like a good idea, but it have a few disadvantages too.

One is that your ISP (Internet Service Provider) generally does not
carry all newsgroups. Thats because some are very large, some are not
interesting and some are downright strange or untasteful. If your ISP is
not a commercial one, but a company or a university, it may even be
policy question to allow access to NG's in general, or even specific
ones.

The other is that SPAM (this dreadful word) will usually be a big
problem if the NG is not moderated. The moderator(s) will have to look
into each and every post, to check that it is suitable for the NG in
question, so that will be a major task even if distributed over a small
group. Most NG's are not moderated, so they are infested with spam for
all kinds of Net stuff - even the more untasteful parts.

A listserver (the mail-central of this list) is using email for
distribution instead of the Usenet news-server network. This is not as
efficient, at least in theory, but is probably a better way to cater for
our interests - as long as our host is willing to give us the recources.

Which leads me to say:

A big THANK'S to our list serve host. I feel a little ashamed to confess
that he/she is unknown to me... Therefore, step forward to be praised!
