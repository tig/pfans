That's and easy one as I had to do the same for mine.  First, pull out the
battery.  Clean out all the rust underneath it.  Once you have done that
You will probably find a hole.  That is where your water is coming in.  I
patched the hole I had with fiberglass.  I recommend a couple of layers to
add strength to hold the battery.  Once the glass has cured protect it with
battery compartment sealer or like I did, use some rubberized undercoating.
 I haven't had any leaks since I applied the treatment to my car.  To help
it from coming back, make sure the drain is clear (front of the battery
compartment) and try not to park uphill when it may rain.  The water stays
in the compartment that way.

Not sure on this one as I have never done so myself (on a P-car).  I
suggest getting the Haynes manual and follow the directions.  When changing
rear brakes always jack both sides and only disassemble one side at a time.
 That way if you make a mistake you have a guide to go by.

>3) My front defroster doesn't blow air with enough force.  Connecticut

Hmmm, had this problem too.  I had limited success fixing it.  Two things,
make sure that all vents are connected together and there is no air leaks. 
Second make sure that the fan slider is making full contact with the high
position on the controls.  The disassembly is a major pain.  Good luck.
