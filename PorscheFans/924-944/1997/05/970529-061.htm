I have an 86 951 with 83,000 miles on it, and thought the brake booster was
going bad.  At different times and sometimes related to running under boost
the brake would get real hard and take a lot of effort to stop the car.  I
first changed the check valve to the booster thinking that it was the
problem, but the hard brake peddle still appeared.
  I found the problem after removing the intake manifold.  The vaccum line
from the brake booster runs under the manifold and into a plastic "Y"
connection.  The "Y" connection on my car had come apart!  A little touch of
epoxy and the problem was fixed.  Instead of a $200+ brake booster all I
needed was a touch of epoxy.
