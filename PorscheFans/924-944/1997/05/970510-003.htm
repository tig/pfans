Think this is a good question for the list:

Where can the spring center clutch for a Normally Aspirated car be had?

What is the opinion of any one who has used it?

My opinion is that you will need to replace it sooner.  I drove on an
ailing clutch for a year nursing it along on one car.  My car second
demanded attention right away.  If you can spare the time (about 2 - 3
days), you will have the rest of the summer to enjoy your car.  I am
assuming you plan to do this yourself?  If not, the labor costs are very
expensive (about 10 - 15 hours worth of work).  Clutches should be
available for under $400.00 for the NA clutch.  I do not know what price
the spring center clutch disk is, but it will add to you costs.
