>I bought a couple R1's the same time Gary Cuzzo did. The size would
probably been the same 225/15-16. One front was fine, the other corded in 2
days at Bridgehampton and one day was in the rain!! No I didn't flat spot
them. In one spot about an inch long cord showed, the rest of the tire
looked new. I went back to the place I bought them, they agreed that the
tire was defective, and sent it back to BFG. Like an ass I PAID for a
replacement and even Mounting and Bal. That was Aug 96. Since then the story
I have heard is BFG lost the tire, these things take time ect. My feeling is
yes they are race tires, but this was clearly a screw up on their part. As
for the supplier they are doing " what they can ". I have bought several
sets of R1 from them, tires for my Blazer and sent several others there for
tires, if I don't get a free replacement the next time I'm there they will
lose all my money, as well as the money from the other people I've sent
there! From a business point of view I don't think they should have let it
gone this long, I believe they might feel that I will let it die, I won't.
My cash is green, other stores might do the same thing, I might end up
seeing if they will.
>If they had taken care of this in August I would have praised them on line
as well as at PCA events, for now my mouth (until this point) has been shut.
The $150 with M&B might end up costing them much more.
