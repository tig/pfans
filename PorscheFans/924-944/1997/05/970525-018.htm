Hello Jeff.  I'm going thru the same process. Have only had my R1s on the
track 3 times.  The R1s are, according to BFG, backwards from other tires
in terms of pressure because of their asymmetrical sidewall thickness.  If
you want a corner to stick more, decrease (not increase) the pressure.  For
a car of your weight and drive setup, BFG recommends starting at 34F/32R
and working carefully from there.  Driver opinions vary on what works best,
and it also depends on your suspension setup.  One good driver I know likes
25F/22R. At the other extreme, some don't recommend going below 30 psi.
I've found that 30F/28R works for me. If I drop to 28F/26R, the wear on the
front tires increases quite a bit, and the rear end feels a little sloppy. 
I've got an '89 S2 w/ stock, non-M030 springs and torsion bars, so the car
leans a fair amount in the corners. Have a feeling that if I stiffened the
suspension and lowered the car, the lower pressures would work.

I recommend you check out the BFG website on "the care and feeding of R1s".
