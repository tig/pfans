I've always considered installing one of these on my cars but the same
reason keeps me from doing this everytime - The low life loser who has
nothing, will never have anything, and just wants to destroy other peoples
property.  Can you imagine coming out to your car at night, cranking the
car, and seeing that dreaded low oil light - YIKES.  BTW, i also put people
in this class that door ding cars GRRRR!
