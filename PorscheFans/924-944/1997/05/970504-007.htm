Where did you get this information?  Sorry if this beats a dead horse--
I've missed the list for a few weeks when the email server apparently lost
my name (?).  If FR-12 is anything like R-12 then it is essentially inert
to everything.  Who did this testing and where can we see the results?  It
would seem very unlike a company the size of Pennzoil to produce a bogus
product, especially since they have their reputation to defend.
