Anders,
       I think a cross-reference list is an excellent idea, but don't know if 
one exists.

944 bearings are shared with VW's. I believe the front bearings on the 944 are 
the same as the rear bearings on the rabbit, and vice versa. I replaced the 
front bearings and seals on my '86 944 for about $10 per side in parts. (The 
guy at the auto parts store where I bought the bearings claimed that many 
parts suppliers will sell the same parts for different vehicles at drastically 
different prices He claims dealers do this mostly.Can't say if this is true or 
not, but I wouldn't be surprised!)

My friend says the steel a-arms look the same as those on his rabbit, I don't 
know about the bushings..

Let us know what you find out!

Thanks,
Ezra
