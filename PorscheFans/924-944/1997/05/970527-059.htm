As a run out model in England Porsche offered a 944 S2 SE model. It had
a "revised" computer claimed to produce 225 hp. It also had what was
described as "turbo cup" suspension. However it still had torsion bars
on the back @ 30mm diameter.

Looking in the technical specifications manual for the 944S/S2/T/TS, I
realized that the specific output of the S engine is higher than that of
the S2.  If the s.o. for the S2 was at the level of the S, the S2 should
be able to produce 227hp.  Does anybody remember from articles or
discussions
if the S2's s.o. is what it is due to low-end torque design
considerations
or was Porsche not willing to produce a NA car which had more power than
the
previous year's stock 944T (217hp)?

Just curious...
