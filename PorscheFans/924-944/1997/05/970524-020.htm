My '88 944S came with 215/50 15 BF Goodrich Comp TA VR4s.
Despite their name these are in no way 4 season tires
(at least not if one of those seasons is Montreal winter!).
They are mid-priced, incredibly durable, provide moderate
dry traction with progressive breakaway, and are excellent
in the wet.

>Hello 944 fans:
>
>I was searching for the Porsche Owners Club and stumbled upon your site. I
hope 
>you don't mind me posing the following question to you.
>
>Would any of you fans be able to suggest a good street rain tire for a 1985 
>Porsche 944 with 15 inch wheels? It rains a lot here in Newfoundland so I
would 
>rather put my money into something that performs better in the wet than the 
>dry. Do you know of any way to get an 'official' recommendation from the 
>Porsche company as to what they would recommend?
>
>The car has its original 15 inch wheels and I don't want to change them but I
>am finding that there are very few 215-60-15 tires available with a V or Z 
>rating that are optimized for driving in wet conditions. I do not want to
buy a 
>'4-season' tire as the car is stored for the winter anyway, which in 
>Newfoundland terms means from mid-November to mid-May, that is, until the salt 
>is all gone from the roads.
