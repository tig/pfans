We'll try not to take that the wrong way!  What you describe sounds like
what I experienced about two years ago with my 944-- and I think the 924S
has the same engine (somebody correct me here if that's wrong).  Have you
noticed any oil in your radiator fluid?  In my case the oil cooler seals
were leaking and creating this sticky "sludge".  The oil-pressure relief
valve sits right below there and was apparently becoming clogged.  The
result was a vehicle which was extremely difficult to start when cold but
which started fine when warm.  The sticking valve was creating a
over-pressure situation where the engine had to pump cold, thick oil at a
higher-than-normal pressure while starting, creating a drag.  I too
experienced the no-spark situation and was dumbfounded for the longest time.

The solution?  One particular thing I noticed is that the vehicle did not
experience a *weak* spark but rather it either had *no* spark or a normal
spark.  After some consideration I realized that only a computer is so
decisive about such things (either it's on or it's off, no in betweens).  I
had read about a safety feature built into the DME which cuts the fuel pump
if the engine isn't above a certain RPM after some very brief period of
time.  So I finally concluded that the same computer program which cuts
power to the fuel pump was also not allowing the engine to fire unless it
reaches a certain minimum RPM while cranking (about 200RPM is what I
suppose).  This, combined with the extra drag caused by the sludge, were
making the car nearly impossible to start when cold.

In the course of this investigation I ended up with a new battery, a
rebuilt starter, and a rebuilt alternator ($$$$$$$), none of which solved
the problem.  An interesting side note is that when a booster was attached
to the battery, the car started fine.  Of course, with basically unlimited
amperage available, it's pretty hard not to reach the minimum RPM, even
with a drag.

You should also replace the oil pressure relief valve with the newer
(updated) 1-piece version which obsoletes the three-piece version found in
944 models from at least 85.5 to sometime in 87 or 88.  They are pricey
($215 when I did mine), but well worth it (that's another discussion for
another day).

Let me know if any of this helps.
