There is no reason to blueprint your engine once a chip is installed.
You have not changed any of the engine internals.  The only part about the
chip that could make a difference is that the rev-limit is now raised in
some cases, and even that doesn't warrant a blueprint.  I think some of
you guys are a but too worried about reliability in a 944T with chips.
The cars were run in the Turbo Cup series with the boost cranked and in
every race I watched when I was young, I never saw more than one blow up
and that one was a head gasket that blew.  Sure, with higher boost come
different requirements, stick to these recommendations and you'll be fine:

1. When running at prolonged high boost (track events), run a part mix of
   unleaded race gas.  This allows the engine to run cooler, reduce the
   chance of detonation and reduce the hammering that head gaskets and piston
   rings take under high boost when riding the edge of detonation.
2. Change your oil every 3000 miles with a quality synthetic.
3. When something seems like it will break, replace it, don't wait for it
   to break and cause more grief.
4. Run a quality fuel on the street, 92-94 octane is the minumum.  If you have
   to drive in an area that has only 89 octane and you use it, DO NOT GO FULL
   BOOST with chips or you will likely blow a head gasket or in a worse case
   scenerio, the piston rings will get shattered from the detonation.
5. Enjoy the car to its fullest!

I still don't think a blueprint is necessary, even on a re-built motor.
All of the specs nowadays on parts are so precise that there really is
no need to re-blueprint an engine after rebuilding it.  If you are using
low quality parts, then sure it might be worthwhile, but if you are using
Mahle pistons, etc, there should be no need for it.

In the end, there is no need to be overly concerned about reliability with
a chipped 944T.  You can go too far with the boost pressure, but the
current chips available run at a decent boost rate.  I'd love to see the
faces of those people who think the 1.0bar they have is too high,
when they hook up a real boost gauge and read the numbers.  I'd bet that almost
all of the chipped cars peak out at almost 1.3bar and then drop down to 0.9bar
or thereabouts.  The cars with the drilled cycling valves run about 1psi higher
in the top end than the boost bolt dudes.

I feel this whole overreactive nature of Porsche modifications is ridiculous.
Every single 944T in our area in B.C. chipped and the only ones I've seen
blown up are those who install manual boost controllers and crank them up
until the guy in the next lane is behind.  Don't worry, install the chips
and sleep peacefully at night with images of seeing 2.0bar on the gauge
and the competition falling further and further behind.

Farzaan.
Chipped and Proud!
