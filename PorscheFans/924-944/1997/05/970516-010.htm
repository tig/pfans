Hi All,
   The stuff is great!   
   There were alot of jokes but few serious answers.  I have 
used the stuff for two years now.  I instruct with PCA, BMWCC, 
Track Time ,etc and run on the track at least twice a month.  I 
run a white C2.  In spite of all the track miles, my car looks 
great.
   We just put it on last night for this weekend's Track Time 
event at the Glen.  It takes about 15 min to apply.  I like the 
way it looks when applied with a roller.  I use it almost 
clear.  Takes less than 10 mins to peal it off when I come 
home.  All those rubber marks, dead bugs, etc. just peel right 
off and I have a clean car again.  I only use it on the high 
impact areas on the front.  I won't stop a big rock, but it 
does prevent the sand blasting I used to get.  If I could stand 
to sit around all day, my car could do well in a concours.
   The "bozo" mentioned in one of the responses is a friend of 
mine who applies it to his whole car thickly with a brush.  He 
mixes colors with it and likes to listen to people's horror 
that someone would paint a sacred Porsche with a brush.
   His car is heavily campaigned and when he gets home and 
peels off the latex, he still has a beautiful dark metallic 
grey paint job.  Hey, who's the bozo?
   I highly reccomend it.  I have no connection to it.  I just 
think it is a great product for those of us who like to run our 
cars hard but still care what they look like.

Good Luck,
Dodge
