P-Fans,

Yeah, what is it about the 944 that looks so good? Parts of it look a bit
strange, like the area around the rear windows.  I agree that the fenders
are the dominant attractive feature, but most of all it's the crease down
the side of the car. Most sports (or sporty) cars just don't have creases
anymore.  The 944's got a great hood line, and then - wham - great creases
at the fenders.  I love to open the garage door and take a look at my S2.
Seems like it's always asking "Feel like a fast midnight run tonight?"
Almost like having to take your dog for a walk. Can't keep a Porsche cooped
up in the garage too long. (This thread isn't developing too much in the
way of a sexual overtone, is it?).

Anyway, I think I created a future Porsche fanatic last weekend. Was
stopped at an intersection downtown (what passes for downtown in Laramie,
WY) and a 3-4 yr old kid was holding his mother's hand as they walked
across the street. He stared at the S2 as he passed, and then continued
walking backwards down the block keeping his eyes on the car. Go figure.
It's Porsche magic.
