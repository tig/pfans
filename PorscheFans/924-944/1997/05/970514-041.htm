Roger,

In a recent post, and at the risk of repeatinging myselfself, I noted that we
in Montana have had a couple of years to check out the practical limits of
highway driving, at least during the day.   I drive about as fast as I can get 
away with, and often do it in my 928 which, with upgraded suspension and
a bit more horsepower than stock, is a reasonably formidable road machine.

What I have found interesting is that other than on some straight rural 
secondaries, very few two lane highways give you the visibility and lack
of congestion to make driving much over 80 very safe.   Above that speed
the visibility over hilltops, around turns, and into hedge lined driveways 
just isn't good enough to avoid a real crapshoot.    Also, while the car
handles higher speeds and increased slip angles wonderfully, I think a
set of Z-rated tires a year is kinda expensive, but that's what you have to
pay for so much hard cornering.

It is a sad state of affairs, but the habits of the friendly villagers aren't
any different now than they were 23 years ago when we went to the 
double nickel, even though the average capability of our machines is
vastly improved.   In a bizarre paradox, Montana traffic fatalities have 
gone DOWN with the lifting of speed limits, yet the general population
is evenly split over the issue of reinstating them.   The perception is,
to a degree, that vacationers are now coming to Montana just so they
can loosen the reins on their Aerostars and omigod shouldn't we do
something about it.  Others of us think that our neighboring states 
ought to follow our lead.   

To merely discuss the possibility of higher speed limits carries the 
aura of heresy in so many circles!   Yet there are those, like Kevorkian,
who occasionally take a brave stand against archaic legal principles,
but I can't see the public staging a march on Washington to advocate
a substantially higher national speed limit.   So you and I have to
sneak around to do what we believe is morally right, but which we 
know is legally wrong.   Go figure.

I will think of you the next time I head north on I-15 in triple digits
with my radar detector off.

Dave
