Hi Pfans


I know this thread is days old (I've been catching up on my mail).  Farzaan
was asking about the Porsche factory tour and museum.  I visited the museum
in '95 (before I had a Porsche) and was disappointed then that it was really
a 356 and 911 museum.  The vehicles on show (at the time) were all 911s or
racing derivatives of the 911, and it was pretty small.  Apart from some
references to the water cooled cars, the 914 etc on some timelines on the
wall, it was as though they had never existed.  (I didn't even know it was
possible to visit the factory, and didn't enquire about it).

You really must visit the Deutschesmuseum in Munich.  It is the best museum
I have ever been in, and has a superb vehicle collection, including a
one-off stainless steel bodied 911.
