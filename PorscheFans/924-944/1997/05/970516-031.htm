Hi Guys,

That's one reason why people change chips in NA cars. The rev limiter
on that car is a 'brick wall' type. Hit a certain RPM, it shuts off the
motor.  It's effective at protecting the motor, but not the rest of the
car (hit the rev limiter when you're tracking out of a corner, and you
might find yourself heading off the track backwards). The aftermarket
chips usually move the rev limiter up 500 rpm, and more importantly,
change the rev limited design from the 'brick wall' type, to a 'roll
off' type, where the motor gets shut off in a smoother fashion. To me,
that was enough of a reason to change the chip (even if I might have
gotten another 5 HP).

That's how you blow up motors. The rev limiter cannot help if you blow
a downshift. If happens on the track too frequently, especially on 911's
whose owners sometimes get second gear when they want 4th, or 1st when
they want 3rd (although that ones kind of rare). Downshift into the 
wrong gear, let the clutch out, BOOM, end of motor. I've seen it happen
at Bridgehampton. Not pretty.
