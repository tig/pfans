Hi Mike:
Regarding the 33 bar rear brake regulator on a 944TS.

Yes, the 33 bar regulator is a Porsche part from either the 928 or
930 (can't remember which).  The change put more braking effort into
the rear pads, evening out the wear and the braking.  I liked it,
however, be sure to test (gingerly, then more strongly) to see that
on your vehicle you do not get rear lockup before front, else you'll
have a really squirrelly ride.  I don't think this is a problem, but
do some low speed stops before going out on the road/track.

The switchover was easy, once I located the regulator.  On my TS it
was snugly hidden behind the right front wheel well cover near the
firewall.  You'll have to bleed the system after the change and be
meticulous about the hookup's integrity.  Then, better braking,
enjoy!

Ray Jang
