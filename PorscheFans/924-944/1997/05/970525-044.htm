When we were racing SCCA DP in the 1980's, our motors utilized flat top
pistons, modified turbo heads (with high lift cams, special valve
buckets and adjusting pucs), headers, mechanical fuel or side draft
webers, etc., and we were only getting about 185-200 HP.  For a street
car, that is a bit extreme to go to all of that expense. 

What is the goal for the motor and how will it be used??  Race?  Street?
Time trial?  

Options to a street motor include :

extrude hone the head, intake, and exhaust
Cam reground (spec. would depend upon whether you use CIS or not)
install carbs and manifolds
total rebalance
deck engine block for higher compression
..020" Euro pistons 
modify exhaust (such as modifying a 944 exhaust to fit on the 924...not
too hard to do)
Flowmaster muffler (may not produce any more power but it sounds like it
does)

There are other things to do, but these are starters.  Don't expect a
large power increase from any of this.  Collectively, it will produce
more power, but not a lot. 

The motor has a lot of potential though.  My GTS Club Sport had at least
280HP (ask Dave Maynard), and the IMSA 924 Carrera GTR we raced had
about 400HP.
