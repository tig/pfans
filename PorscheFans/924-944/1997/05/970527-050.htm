Great work Matt, however, as much as I would like to agree, I think some of
your points might actually go the other way.  To that argument I have done
the following and have never been so much as stopped in all eight years of
Porsche driving and to put it bluntly, "I ain't no saint".

1) Staying in one lane is not the intent of the law.  Although every state
I have seen allows passing on the right, the law stipulates that slower
traffic stay in the right lanes and passing be done in the left.  This rule
is much more enforced in Europe than in the U.S.  The correct procedure is
stay in the right lane and pass only the left.  I also signal all lane
changes and turns with my turn signals (blinker fluid be damned).  This may
be higher profile, but it is legally correct.

2) Absolutely right on Matt!  Tailgating is a ticket for disaster.

3) From my experience, and citing a recent article by Andy Saunders in
Excellence (The Price of Speed, April 1997, pp. 97), red cars do not raise
a flag with police officers.  Again, owning two red 944 cars, and citing
Saunders (pp. 97) "Most road cops are going to look for movement through
traffic, and unless there's something extremely unusual about the car, it's
the movement that's going to attract notice rather than the car or it's
color".

I find this true with my own driving.  So I would raise question with car
color being a target.

4) It is best not to speed, but we are what we are and circumstances get
the best of us.  On long trips a 10 mph gain in forward velocity will save
you driving time.  If you drive an 8 hour trip at 65 mph and average 10 mph
faster (75), you can cut one hour off your drive time.  The time you save
is at the end of the trip right where you are normally the least alert and
subject to the greatest risk of accident (statistically according to
insurance companies).  If you can do it in a safe manor, it is worth while
and that is why many of the big states have raised their limits beyond the
popular 65 mph seen in most states.  Saunders (pp. 97) stated California
law as ""No person shall drive a vehicle on a highway at a speed greater
than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility,
the traffic on, and the surface and width of the highway..."".

Saunders (pp. 98) also cited that "A smoothly-driven car, under control is
less likely to attract attention, whatever speed it is being driven".  The
interviewing officer (pp. 98) claimed that "Probably the rudest car on the
street is the 5.0 Mustang.  The drivers push those things, and they just
don't get it.  It's not a great handling car at high speeds, but the guys
driving those things think they're Mario Andretti.  You find them wrapped
around poles, over the edge, broken in half, but it's not often you find a
high-dollar sports car out there".

In closing, all of this is a general rule.  You will still get stopped for
seemingly no good reason from time to time (1 mph over the limit!), but you
just don't know what that officer has just seen an hour ago.  He may have
just finished scrapping the brains and skull of one of those "Mustang"
drivers off the street, or just left some mother's home after informing her
that her son has just died in a senseless high speed accident.  Under such
duress, any officer may be hostile and slam it to you big time, but he is
just trying to keep you from being another statistic where he has the
odious task of informing one of your loved ones of your hideous demise.

Just my opinion.
