Here are the consequences of not paying traffic tickets.  Please note that
it doesn't matter if it is your home state, or just a state you happen to
be passing through.

	1. Your driving privlegdes will eventually be suspended;
	2. The next time you are stopped for a violation, you will receive two
tickets.  One for the initial violation that caused you to get stopped in
the first place, and a ticket for driving on a suspended license.  he
driving on a suspended license charge will require an appearance in court,
as it is not a prepayable fine in any state.  If you are lucky and get a
liberal judge, the charge may be changed to no valid license instead.
	3. Now that you have been informed by Law Enforcement that your license is
suspended, you car will be towed to the destination of you choice, or it
will be impounded by the officer if you do not agree to get a tow truck.
This is because the department does not want to be named in a law suit if
you are involved in an accident after you have been advised that you are a
suspended driver in that state.  Law suits and the deep pockets that every
victim will be dreaming about after the possible accident prevent the
officer/trooper from allowing you to drive in his presence .  
	4. Now if you live in NC and are stopped in VA (or any other state for
that matter) and the officer runs a DMV check and learns that you are
suspended in you home state (NC) or in say VA, you probably will be
arrested and brought before a magistrate since you have a history of
ignoring tickets/summones.  Officer's are required to bring someone before
a magistrate if they feel the person is likely to ignore the ticket.
	5. If you haven't figured out the additional costs involved in #4...if you
are brought to see a magistrate, you car will be towed.

Pay the tickets, or go to the court date and contest the ticket; however,
it is my professional opinion that you are in for a lot more problems if
you fail to pay the fine.
