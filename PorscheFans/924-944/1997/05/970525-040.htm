This is in response to e-mail sent by a Matt Warner stating that my
trevia answer didn't make any sense.  This response is from the same
gentleman who e-mailed the list and stated that a stuck "open" oil
pressure relief valve could cause too "high" of oil pressure (from list
of about 5/20).  He also stated that DME's don't fail and that a slow
cranking/no start problem was caused by too high of oil pressure.  Well,
I cannot say what was wrong with that particular gentleman's car, but my
experience in the professional repair of Porsches tells me that DME's do
fail and that too high of oil pressure will not keep the engine from
starting.  It may create other problems, but the engine will start. 
Also, I don't think I have ever seen TOO high of oil pressure caused by
a stuck "open" oil relief valve.

I stand behind my trevia question and answer.  His response got off into
starters and fuel pumps and their current draws, etc.  He even stated
that the DME does provide the pulsing ground for the injectors, then got
off into a positive power flow problem, which has nothing to do with the
DME pulsing ground to the injectors.  If my answer is read correctly,
the DME RELAY provides the positive power and the DME CONTROL UNIT
provides the pulsing ground.  My responseto him is to duplicate the
symptoms as I have stated, run the current test with a noid or a DVOM
and a special wire connector and analyze the results

Don't worry too much about whether you agree or not with the diagnosis
or not "because it doesn't make sense" until you have run the tests and
seen the results.  

Matt Warner does not have to agree with my analysis, but I would bet
money that that is because the "theory" itself does not make sense to
him, but no actual tests have been conducted by him.  I have seen this
problem probably 25 times over the last 5-6 years with customers 944's,
some of which have been towed in from other repair shops with 
DME's, pumps, injectors, etc. replaced.

As to my answer being demeaning to him and the rest of the list, and
"touting" my experience and offering prizes for "misleading"
information, that is far from the truth. Yes, I have been around 944's
since they came out in 1982, racing them since 1983 in SCCA and IMSA,
and have had a Porsche repair shop since 1977, so I guess to him I am
"touting" my experience, but I am always available to answer questions. 
I put this in a quiz format and offered a prize because people are more
likely to read the quiz and remember the problem/solution if it is
offered as such.   I repair Porsches everyday and some of the e-mail I
read on the list contains incorrect answers to problems I deal with
daily, so I want to give a little of my experience away to you guys to
help.  What does it matter to him if I want to give away something to
those that respond??  This "tip" may save several members untold amounts
of money and grief if remembered.  When is the last time a competent
repair shop offered you free advice, instead of charging troubleshooting
time??

I apolgize to those reading if this is too long or irrelevant, but the
e-mail that was sent to the list by Matt Warner saying my diagnosis is
in error blew a fuse with me because he obviously has not run any
physical tests himself (as I did on three customer 944's just to double
and triple check my answer).  Has anyone performed the test I
suggested??  Let me know.

If those on the "list" like or dislike a trevia quiz, let me know.
I can be called at (817)332-6547, or just e-mail me.

Thank you
