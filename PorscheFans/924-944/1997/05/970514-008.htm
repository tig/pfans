I FOUND A WAY TO DEFEAT IT!

I bought a keyless entry unit at ABC Appliance (in Metro Detroit).  For
the last few weeks, they've been selling the Code Alarm Keyless entry,
installed, for $59.  The installation is performed at Mickey Shores, and
I paid the installer another $20 to wire up the rear hatch release,
also. The fob is about 1.5" square, and has two buttons: one for the
door locks and another for the rear hatch release.  

It is the greatest thing... no more key scratches around the door lock
or on the rear deck lid.  No more fumbling in the dark to find the key
hole. No more setting down packages to release the rear deck.  And the
alarm is activated automatically when the doors are locked!

I've had keyless entry on every car I've owned for the last several
years, It's hard to go back to using a key after the convenience of
keyless entry.
