>trauma? read: thermostat snap ring

>I got the thing off, but the ring that came out is not the ring that is
>going back in... what on earth! is that thing a joke?
>
>first off, it's a heavy duty piece of heavy duty steel, it did not flex
>easily even after it was out and I had two pairs of pliers gripping it...
>it's a serious piece of metal...
>
>second off, Porsche wisely put the chassis frame right smack in front of
>the water pump opening... killer, I need a heavy duty tool that ALSO fits
>in a tight space... peering through the slit between the passenger
>headlight and the front snout I was able to see kinda alright as I hung my
>arm over the front of my jacked up ride and fiddled with the pliers... but
>man, the wierd body positions I have had to assume since starting this
>project... my body hurts in strange places... I do like the scratch
>collection I'm getting on my hands and arms... real cool, rough and
>tough... I bet Harley dudes don't get as many scratches...
>
>The $10 snap-ring pliers I used to get it out are in the trash... I
>destroyed 3 of the 4 heads that came with it... I will obviously need a
>more heavy duty tool to put a new one back in...

>>From the 944FAQ, is Snap-On Tool PR5645A (45 degrees with .09 tips) still a
>good choice? How can I, average, if even, Joe, get a hold of a Snap-On
>product?

>progress? read: I shoved a garden hose nozzle into the upper cylinder head
>hose opening (where the bleed screw is) and let it fly... since I had the
>block drain plug out and the radiator and all hoses out (including the
>steel pipe heading into the heater core) and the t-stat out water seems to
>have run through the block and out the block drain plug and out the
>t-stat... it felt great seeing all the goo coming out... if you do this, be
>wise like I was, rubber band baggies over all open pipes, hose fittings,
>etc, that are not water/cooling related- especially the exhaust... with the
>manifolds off, the block drain plug would put water right into the exhaust
>pipe...
>
>I feel that I got a lot of the goo out, enough to where after I clean the
>head and stuff after I take them off, I'll just put the engine back
>together, drive it for a few weeks, and plan to drain/flush it once...
>which is the good advice I received from several list members...

>progress? read: thanks to Dave Cooley and Doug Donsbach, I am at peace

>I understand TDC and its relation to the belt system much better, my engine
>is indeed in pretty good alignment right now with the old belts on there...
>I'm not too worried about getting the new ones on there, lined up right,
>and tensioned correctly...

>thanks for all the help so far... hoping to finish by the end of this
