Hey dudes,

I just got an email from a buddy that was videotaping yesterday's autocross.
For whatever reason, he was videotaping Paul and I and sent me an email because
he thought I should know about something that happened during my run.

I thought I'd pass this info on to you so you don't make a stupid mistake
like this in the future.  On my last run, I decided to try and launch the
car a bit harder than just starting off, so I took the car to about 3000rpm
and slipped the clutch a bit.  It was a great launch, no smokey burn-out,
no smell from the clutch, just a nice smooth take-off, except . . .  I rolled
through the timing lights while trying to get the rpms right.

On the previous two runs, I just left the line like normal.  The guys go,
I went.  The third run, I got my rpms right and then left the line, but
he said I rolled past the timing lights (which were about 1ft in front of the
air dam) before I actually launched.  That explains why my time went down from
49's all morning to a lousy 50.6 in the end.  Oh well, live and learn.  We'd
never done a standing start with the lights so near before.  Usually, they
stick the lights around a bend or something to not give AWD cars an
advantage and to promote reliability of drivetrain components, or they at
least move the lights up a bit, not right in front of the car!

Farzaan.
