I didn't have my 951 long before purchasing a set of S-02 tires for
it, so I can't really compare before/after too well.  With the S-02s,
the car is always ready to answer throttle in slow corners with nice
oversteer.  I've never owned a car anywhere near this fast before,
so I don't push it too hard through sweepers or any fast corners.
The tires do seem to let you know well in advance when the limit
is approaching.

These tires are by far the best rain tires I've ever owned.  No
questions about it.

They certainly do live up to their 'Z' rating. :)  Now, tell the truth,
did you really stop at only 150mph?

No more so than comparable tires such as Michelin Pilots or the Pirelli
P-Zeros.  Besides, good tires and good brakes are two of the most
important safety features of the car!

I'll jump in on this one.  I've had mine for about 6000 miles.  So far,
so good.  They are wearing very evenly, except for my left front which
may have to be replaced soon.  I am planning to replace both front
lower control arms soon, because I believe a bad ball joint to be the 
culprit on the offending corner of the car.
