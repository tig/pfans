Scott, it is possible to replace the valve seals with the head on, but
it is difficult.  It consists of removing the valve cover and the cam
and all the cam followers (mark them so that they will be replaced in
the same location).  Each cylinder will have to be pressurized at TDC
when doing the respective intake/exhaust seals per cyl..  We use a leak
down tester, but other methods can be used (regulate the air to 100 PSI.
max.)
and use some means to keep the engine from turning over when the cyls.
are pressurized.  If you don't have valve spring compressor tools for a
924, they can be made out of a old socket (about 24-27mm) with about 40%
of one side cut out and a bevel put in the top of the socket to press
against and a long bar for pressing down the socket.  You also need a
long thin magnet to pull out/install the valve keepers.

The job is more complex than what I am describing here, but it can be
done.  You can call me at (817)332-6547 and I will give you more
details.

Good luck...Don Istook
