Well, wife and I just got back from a nice vacation in the Blue Ridge 
Mountains.  It was the first time we had ever driven Pollyanna (our 944 
told me this was her name) on an extended vacation.  I have spent the 
last year totally restoring her and had serious reservations about 
driving from Southwest Florida to North Carolina.  What about stone 
chips and rain and birds and icky highway stuff getting all over the 
paint and undercarriage?  My wife brought me back to reality by quoting 
me, "Porsches were made to be driven" and, I did buy a front cover and 
mirror covers.  So off we went.  We enjoyed the trip immensely.  Set 
the cruise on 77 (I did kick it up to 110 on several occasions when I 
felt it was safe to do so) and motored down the road.  Driving the 
twisting and winding mountain roads was really a treat!!!  On the 
return trip, my wife pointed to a Conquest and thought it was a 944.  I 
explained to her the difference.  However, I began looking at the 
traffic and started to notice little things, hey the Mazda tried to 
copy the front end.  Hey that Nissan did to.  Wait a minute, doesn't 
the rear quarter panels of that new firebird look like a feeble attempt 
to copy the 944!  As I continued to look at numerous other "sports 
cars," it dawned on me that I was driving a 12 year old car that had 
graceful yet powerful lines all the car manufacturers were still trying 
to copy to this day. Nuff said!!!!!

BTW, I thought I saw an 86 951 leaking brake/clutch fluid and careening 
precariously around the Blue Ridge Parkway being saved from certain 
disaster by just four little brake pads.  Naweed???
