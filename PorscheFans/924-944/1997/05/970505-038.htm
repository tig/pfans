well, maybe somebody else has seen the goo, but, I really hope not...

+ + +

after nearly two months of buying parts and living in fear, I have started
the mighty engine resealing (head/valves/oil cooler/cam-balance shafts)
project on my 1987 944 NA...

I have an advanced state of goo in my engine via the infamous oil cooler
leak...

I'm replacing the radiator and the expansion tank and although the water
hoses are less than 6 months old, I could only clean two of the four major
ones satisfactorily to reuse, at least they were the expensive two...

HELP!

this weekend saw the removal of everything but the belts/valves/heads...
the power steering system is being cleaned, I'll fix that leak!... the
exhaust is off, the intake and related fuel injection are off... the
radiator, fans, expansion tank, air filter are off...

tonight I remove the valve assembly and head... the front part of the
cooling system is going to be alright since the radiator/expansion tank are
being replaced, and the hoses will be fine... my problem is how to clean
the rest of the coolant galleys with the engine in place and with the top
of the engine removed...

the goo is seriously mucky... take 12 packs of spearmint gum, chew
thouroughly, then add 2 cups of water and simmer until goo is an even
consistency, not too thick, not too thin... I think that this is close to
what I'm facing...

all help seriously appreciated...

I feel that I have removed much of the bad goo deposits since the old
radiator and expansion tank are in my trash can, but this stuff is
everywhere the coolant goes, back into the heater are, all throught the
block... as best I can tell, the oil portion of the engine is pretty
alright, it's just oil in the coolant...

I thought about cleaning as best I can, then put car back together, then
run coolant flush and drain, perhaps two or three times... I feel that I
need the heat and flushing agents to "scrub" the insides, however, I don't
want to do this, since many of these parts are new
(radiator/expansion/hoses/t-stat) and it would obviously be best for these
parts to never know the goo I've seen... also, I don't even know if flush
would do anything to a mostly oily mess...

+ + +

PS how do you all do this in a home garage? I'm working outside on the
driveway on the side of my house, and I've already paused twice to hose
down the driveway... is there any way to catch more than 60% of the coolant
when draining? the block plug releases a mighty splash of super evil
water/coolant mix, and the radiator drain plug is no better, since the
pressure pushes water out all over until it calms down, but by then, the
mess is made in about 15 seconds...

I hear a Clash song referencing the EPA: "when they knock at your front
door, how you gonna come? with your hands on your head, or on the trigger
of your gun"... off the album, "Coolant Calling"

thanks!

my friends think I'm nuts for even trying, my girlfriend is convinced the
car will be on a tow truck to a "real shop" in less than a week... Sears
stock up 5/16 on rumors of my impending purchases... there's a shelf
covered with sandwich baggies with notes inside stating where the parts in
the baggies came from... the beater Mazda 626 I borrowed from a friend is
looking more and more like a legitimate second car purchase... will he
persevere? can he see the task through completion? stay tuned...

next up: questions about the belts!
