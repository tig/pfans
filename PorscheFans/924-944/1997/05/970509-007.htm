A message from Naweed Azam  asked about OEM wheels. Yes, the =
manufacturer of the Fuchs alloys is a company called Otto Fuchs =
Metalworks in Germany. The only wheels that I know of they make now are =
in a joint venture with an American company ( Superior Industries ) and =
these wheels are for the new Audi models. These wheels are also forged =
alloys since Otto Fuchs holds a patent on certain processes of forging =
wheels. I do not know for sure if they still make the old style alloys =
for Porsche but I highly doubt it. The maker of the cast (cookie cutter) =
originals for the early 944's was a company called ATS. I am unsure of =
the manufacturer for the phone dials and S2 wheels though I do know =
there were two types made of the S2 & Turbo S wheels. One type was cast. =
The other was forged and highly expensive. These were on the Turbo S =
cars. The Carrera 2 and Carrera Turbo wheels are pressure cast and are =
currently made by Hartman though I don't know if this company was the =
OEM. The current Turbo's wheels are  made by Speedline of Italy. The =
have a forged rim, a pressure cast center, and are friction welded =
together. These wheels are incredibly expensive to manufacture.=09
I hope this little bit of information is helpful.
