Hello fellow Porsche Fans!

A week ago I joined this list as a prospective owner of a 944. I can now
Introduce myself properly as the proud owner of a very clean '86 white
on black 944. I have been a car guy for all of my 35 years or at least
as far back as I can remember. I have worked my way to this point in
time though a string of wonderful automobiles starting with several
'66&'67 Pontiac GTOs, a fabulous '64 Jaguar E-type coupe and a '63
Sunbeam Alpine as well as my more mundane daily drivers.
Only the Jag remains to keep my newest prize company. I cannot believe
my fortune to now have as a daily driven car such a beautiful beast as 
this 944.

Well enough about me. Experiences with my and many other people's exotic
cars on which I have turned a wrench have taught me the value of a good
manual. Would any of you care to reccommend a manual to me? Haynes?
Chiltons? Other?

Any manual purchased will of course be only a supplement to this list
and its' resources.

Thank you in advance.
Kory
'86 944
