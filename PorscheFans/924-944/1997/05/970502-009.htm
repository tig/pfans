I think that was intentionally done by Porsche because they wanted to
sell the concept that the 968 was really a new car and not just a 944 or
924
with the weaker links worked out and people didn't want to pay $40,000
US
for an old design.  I agree that the 968/944 is the best looking
(street)
Porsche ever made.  It wasn't until the 944 series came out that I ever 
became a real Porsche fan.  Sure 911/914/ etc. were great cars but at
the
time I thought they were b#tt ugly.  Since buying my 968 however even
the
911 has grown on me (in turbo dress anyway) and now I want both.  At my
first autocross I really came to appreciate the 911.  It's raw, wild and
sexy
Vs smooth, sleek and sexy like a 968/944.  I feel just the opposite of
guy
who thinks the 968 front end is less appealing than the 944 and likes
the
rear better on the 968.  I really love the round frog eye headlights
especially
at night from the driver's view and from a low front on view the little
air intake
slit is cool.  The 968's rear is cleaner than the 944, almost too clean.
 I prefer
the 944's lens assembly over the smoother one piece 968's.  And yes the
best view of the 944/968 is from above.  Then you can really see the
curves of
the side panels.  And yes I spend most of my time driving looking in the
rear
view mirrors which are aimed in so I see the full flare.  I think most
models
(human not cars) are envious of the 968/944's rear end.  The only
problem
with these beautiful cars is that they are too gorgeous and I'm
reluctant to
track such a great looking car.  Thanks for bearing with me.  Now maybe
the
Boxster will grow on me in 10 years or so.
