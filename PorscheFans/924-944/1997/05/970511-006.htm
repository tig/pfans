Porschefans:

I took my 968 into the dealership for several miscellaneous items recently.
 I mentioned to them that the engine compartment looked as if it had never
been cleaned.  I bought the car used in December, and the outside is quite
nice, but the underhood appearance had been disappointing because of the
dirt.

When I picked the car up, the underhood appearance was gorgeous!  They
cleaned and polished every surface.  I doubt it looked this good when new.
 And the bill was only $25.  The car wasn't any faster or anything, but they
sure made me happy.  I don't know if all dealers will do it this cheaply or
well, but it might be worth asking at the next service visit.
