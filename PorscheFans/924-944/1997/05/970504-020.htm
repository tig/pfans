I'm afraid not Wes. Unless,, of course, you want to modify some sheet metal. There are a number of decent 4 x 6 plate type speakers that will mount in the stock location. For most of these you will need to come up with some sort of grill. For some reason the 4 x 6 speakers are sold without grills and the good ones don't fit under the stock grills. The local autosound place saw me pull in in the 944 and they knew exactly what I wanted before I got to the counter! Being pretty decent guys they took me to a back room full of used bits and pieces showed me a box (!) of used Advent grills and said you need these, pick out your own pair. I found some in good condition - just needed a good cleaning and they let me have them for free! They turned out to be perfect - used the stock mounting location for the screws and were the right thickness so that they covered the new plate speakers but did not hit the dash when the door was closed. I did have to trimm off some of the plactic 'colla!
r that the mounting screw went through, easy job. (I used the Infinity Kappa 4 x 6 plates) I hope this answers an old question about front door speakers. - Mounting is easy the grills are not unless you can find the right parts.
The only other problem with the front speaker location is the depth. When the window is cranked all the way down there is something  like 2 1/2" (not exact) between the mounting position and the glass. Enough room for most things but not all!!
Note:
Even with the high performance stereo installed Quite often I still drive down the road with nothing but the under hood audio system playing it's song.
