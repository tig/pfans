Hi Guys
The reasons for # 2 rod bearing failure are a combination of crankshaft
design, milage, oil quality and changes and oil level.
# 2 rod bearing is vulnerable because of design, but by taking good care of
oil supply by good maintenance and always sufficient oil in the sump this
bearing will lead a normal life with a normal lifespan.
To compensate for this "weak spot" the factory increased the oilsump
volume, installed an oillevel indicator and increased the oilpump output by
10%.
#  2 bearing receives the least oilflow of the 4 bearings and the direction
of the flow in the crankshaft at this point is partly outside-in.
At high engine RPM's the centrifugal forces counteracts the oilflow and at
6500 plus revs the oilflow to # 2 bearing is significantly reduced.
With normal use and good maintenance the factory upgrades take sufficient
care of # 2 bearing oil supply, but if you drive hard all the time, use
poor quality oil, do not change your oil at prescribed intervals or drive
with to little oil in your sump (less than 75%) you put your # 2 rodbearing
at risk.
Redrilling the crankshaft to increase oilflow to # 2 bearing takes care of
the design weakness, but is only necessary for full race cars that
routinely rev over 6500 under heavy loads.
regards
Peter
