Well, I guess I'll finally put my 2.5c (as in 2.5 liter) into this thread.
In February, 1983, I saw an ad (2-page, inside front cover) for the "New
Porsche 944" in a Playboy Magazine.  It was a Guards Red (at that time,
probably the only color they thought would sell) head-on shot, which really
emphasized the bulging front fenders and headlights.  I made up my mind
immediately that I had to have it.  It probably was a full week before I
looked at anything else in the magazine, but was only a couple of days
until I was able to actually see and sit in one of these "beasts of
beauty".  There wasn't one to be found in Chicago, but there was one on
display at the auto show in Milwaukee that weekend - sounded like it was
time for a short road trip.  Luckily, I already knew the sales manager from
CIA, the Porsche/Fiat dealer in "BeerTown", otherwise I would have had to
wait until they got another vehicle.  So, I spent 1 hour in and out of the
car at the show (not too many others had that same opportunity, as you
might imagine), and went back to the dealer the next weekend and placed my
order for a sable brown with brown/beige berber cloth interior, LSD, and
4-spoke wheel.  In August, 1983, I went back up to Milwaukee and took
delivery of my new baby, and nine years and 63k miles later sold it to
another Chicago PCA member after purchasing "my new" 1988 944 Turbo S
Limited Edition, which is my current ride, and although not a "concours"
car, still turns a lot of heads, including my own.
