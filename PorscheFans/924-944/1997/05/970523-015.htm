I seem to recall that many racing fuels contain lead (a good thing for my 66' Shelby GT-350) I also seem to recall that leaded fuels do evil things to O2 sensors. I used to have an air/ fuel ratio gauge that was based on an O2 sensor and it specifically said that it could be exposed to lead fuel exhuast for short periods only.
Any comments?
