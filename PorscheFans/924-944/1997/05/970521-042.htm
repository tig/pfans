Matt (& anyone else who cares),

I have a Weltmeister short shifter installed on my early car and you
couldn't pay me enough to take it off (figuratively). Anyway, I've
driven several 944's since with the normal shifter and they just feel
sloppy to me. Mine is more like a toggle switch, it feels great.

That said, I have had one person tell me that it could cause damage
to the transaxle. I have had at least ten people, though, tell me
they don't see how it could hurt anything. I'm gonna chance it and
leave it in there.

I also have the 1st to 2nd gear shifting problems. I suspected the
short shifter at first, but I've driven (and heard about) too many
cars with the stock shift linkage that exhibit the same problem. I
think it just may be "one of those things" you have to live with.
You can make sure that your linkage isn't binding, that your clutch
& hydraulics are in good shape, and that you always put the clutch
pedal all the way to the floor when you shift. I still have a gallon
of synthetic gear oil in the basement which I will try one of these
years, but I doubt that'll help. If anyone figures it out, please
let me in on it. It adds five seconds to my 0-60 time trying to get
the damn thing into second!
