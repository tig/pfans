Dunno about that one.  Do check under the driver's side passenger 
footwell that the linkages that control the flaps are intact.  It seems 
the little attachment ends become brittle and break over time.  The 
replacements are about $1 or so.

My cruise control always accelerates by 10mph on setting.  When the car 
has been driven for about 10 minutes, it then sets properly.

Usually, the cruise computer is pinned to the fault, but someone here
(forgot who) suggested checking the potentiomenter inside the controller
servo in the engine compartment.  Since the cruise system is feedback
dependent, wear or dirt in the potentiometer can relay false or
intermittent information to the computer.  The same person detailed how to
take the servo apart to clean the pot.  If we don't hear from him, I will
repost the procedure, crediting the author. 

Note that I still haven't gotten around to fixing mine yet.  ;-)
