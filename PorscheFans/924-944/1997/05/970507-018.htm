Sam- Unfortunately there's no real class for the 944 Turbo or any other type
of Turbo in SCCA Club Racing whether it be a Regional or National class.
Many regions have come up with "catch all" classes for certain types of cars
that meet safety requirements (cage, fire bottle, cut-off switch etc.) but
don't fall into one of the normal SCCA classifications.  You will frequently
see classes such as ITE (IT everything), SP (Super Production), ITF (IT
Ferrari) etc. for these types of cars.  It is up to the individual region
hosting the event to list these classes in their registration forms in order
for these cars to be able to run.  In other words, just because your region
lets you run, doesn't mean another will.  You'll generally find that many
regions are anxious for you to run, i.e. they want your money! Be aware that
there's not really any performance regulations in these classes, so in
theory you could find yourself up against the GT1 911!  Unlikely to happen
needless to say, but these classes are basically there for you to have fun
and race.  All of them are Regional only classes so if your interested in
getting your National license and running National races you'll have to get
another car.

The normally aspirated 944 (early) can run in ITS, a "real" Regional only
class. These cars can be competitive but have real stiff competition from
the Datsun 240/260/280 on any courses with long straights.  The 944 will out
handle and brake the Datsun, but more than likely they'll have more HP. If
you really want to spend the bucks you can run a 944 in GT2.  This is the
stomping ground of tube frame cars that sound and look quite a bit different
from anything Porsche built for the street. GT2 is a National class and a
944 has won the Runoffs in GT2 as recently as 2 years ago I believe (Finch).
