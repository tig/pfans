Interesting story...

We were at Daytona last year for the last IMSA event of the season (I 
think).  At any rate, all the Porsches that had gathered in the 
infield got one big lap of the speedway and infield.  The cars were 
paced and the only instructions were no overtaking and stay off the 
embankments.  Of course, most of us took a little ride up the side at 
forty degrees or whatever it is.  It's really neat at 50 mph-feels 
like your car's gonna fall off the wall.

One of the more intrepid 944NA owners liked it so much he stayed on 
the embankment all the way back to the grandstands.  He was rewarded 
with spun bearings and a bottom end rebuild the next week!  I think he 
made it out of the park on the way home and had to be trailered the 
rest of the way...
