There are some drain holes in front of the battery tray and a similar place
on the other side of the car. There are some rubber flaps that tend to
collect leaves and other nasty stuff.

By the way, is your passenger side carpet soaked? If so, you may want to
consider covering the battery tray with pulyurethane or something. It's a
mess to work with, but it stops all leaks.

Take a look at the fan. If I remember correctly, you can get at it by
pulling all heater levers to the far left, then going to the engine
compartment and get off the cover from the odd-looking dome in the middle of
the car, near the windshield. When you get this off, pull the levers to the
far right, and something should pop up, and you should be able to see the
fan and its connections. Hope I remembered this correctly..
