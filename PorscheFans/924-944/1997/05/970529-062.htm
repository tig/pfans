Thank you to everyone who has e-mailed me over the last few days.  I am
happy to answer your questions, but if I am a little late in a response,
please bear with me.  I have received about 80 e-mails in the last 4
days and it takes me a little time to work through them.

Evidently there is considerable interest in getting modified 944 steel
control arms.  I will put together a price and post it on the list in a
day or so.  For those of you who are interested, go ahead and send me an
e-mail and I'll get back with you.  I need to know what type of sway bar
you have and the method of attachment (stock or other...Welt.?)

This is a great list...let's all keep it that way
