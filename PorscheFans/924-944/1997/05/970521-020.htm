The best thing to do is run ALL ground lines back to a single point.
This eliminates the possibility of "gound loops"  If you haven't heard
the affect of one on the sound system of your car, its something that
you don't want to hear.

>> I know some of you stereo guys have the answer to this one. I need to

>> wondering if anyone has drilled into the floor of the rear hatch area. This
>> is scary because of the fuel tank and all being down there. If anyone has
>> done this successfully, please let me know. I guess I'll also have to strap

>> any more holes in the car than I have to.
