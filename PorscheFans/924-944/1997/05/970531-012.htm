Hello Again,
Electro-motorhead question:
I just replaced the O2 sensor on my 86 944NA. (the old one had 114 k miles and the part throttle acceleration was a little rough) I purchased a Bosch 3 wire universal from Europroducts. They claimed that this was a direct replacement except for the long wiring harness and a little soldering would fix that.
The three wires consist of two identical white wires and one other wire. I assumed (!) that the white wires are interchangeable. After installing the new sensor the car runs like crap. Rough and low on power until you reach 7/8 on the pedal and then it takes off. My wife complained of whiplash when it happen in first gear. It was a BIG leap forward when the car decided that I had surpassed 7/8 throttle. After about 5 miles (country driving) I couldn't take it any more and I disconnected the O2 lead. It seemed to run very rich after that. I assume that that is the fail safe mode. I will also assume that the reason for the abrupt change in power at 7/8 throttle is that the throttle position sensor reads full open and this somehow overrides the O2 sensor data.
Any ideas or info on O2 sensors?
Are the two identical white wires interchangeable?
Could this be a bad sensor from the factory?
Does the fact that my clock has the missing semicircle of LCD matter effect the Karma of the electrical system?
Are throttles supposed to be on off switches?

Thanks in Advance
