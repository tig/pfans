Matt,

The whirr is probably the idler roller on the balance shaft belt.   I is
supposed be positioned
not quite touching the belt, but for some reason they occasionally touch,
and when the
belt moves, the roller spins and makes noise.   The service manager is
suffering from 
rectocranial inversion for treating your concerns like that.   

I don't think this is a problem which should cause you much concern, but the
shop should
certainly take it seriously AND correct it.

Dave
