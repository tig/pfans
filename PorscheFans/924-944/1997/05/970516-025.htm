This statement makes no sense.  Your 944 and Biturbo are completely
different cars, and the 911 is yet another completely different car. 
Apples and oranges.  The 911 doesn't really split the difference.  I'm not
trying to start a flame with drivers who prefer 911s, but if you feel that
your 944 is the more competent car, then it sounds like you're trading
competence for character.  It's amusing that a major bad rap on the 944 has
always been that it's too easy to drive.  Get your 944 on the track first,
and see of you can learn to use it's full capabilities.  944s have a way of
developing more character near their limit, and protect you at the same
time.  I see rookies at the track do 360s in their 944s and it doesn't seem
to phase them.

On the other hand, one's personal concept of "character" in a car is
certainly important.  Maybe you really are a 911 kind of guy who would love
the 911s for their unique character.  After all, I don't think many of us
are particularly rationale about our choice of cars.  

By the way, which 911 were you thinking of getting? The power you end up
with might not come close to your Biturbo.
