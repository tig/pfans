Richard,

I have a very similar problem with my 1986 951.  All gear shifts are very
smooth and light, except when going from 1st to 2nd gear.  The 1-2 shift does
appear to be a little more smooth when I am going _very_ slow, like in a
parking lot or something.  My mechanic has never pointed this out as a problem.
Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon, and if so, was it indeed a problem,
and how did you correct it?
