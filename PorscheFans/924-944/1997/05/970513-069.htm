     Wow, slow down!!!! $26.5k????!! Unles you're looking at a prestine car 
     with about 10 miles on it forget it! I just bought my '90 944S2 CAB in 
     excellent(!) condition, brand new tires, 50k miles for $18.5k. Yes, I 
     did get an excellent deal, but look around and you'll find prices much 
     lower than what they ask.
     
     Get a subscription to Porsche Market Letter - it has several listings 
     every month. Also, check out the Porsche Classifieds on-line (I forget 
     the URL, but do a search and it will show up)
     
     The tripple black is about the most common of the relatively rare 
     S2CABs (only app 4400 produced total)
     
     BTW it will be the greatest car you've ever owned and EVERYONE will 
     stop to ask you what this is!!!
     
     Please write directly to me h2frank@uci.edu if you have specifice 
     questions.
     
     Thanks,

Hello all ...
     
(some of you may have seen my cry for help on purchasing a '86 911 ... 
I was back to the dealer today, and saw a '91 944 s2 cab which I am 
now considering)
     
I'm looking to purchase a '91 944 s2 cab from a local Porsche dealer.  I 
don't know much about the 944 s2, and was hoping someone could send me or 
point me to some info/advice on this model Porsche.
     
I would like to know what this model's reliability is like, and what 
issues I would look for or ask about before purchasing this vehicle.
Also, what problem areas does this vehicle have, and which repairs are the 
most common? (like, is the clutch likely to burn out, suspension problems 
etc.)
     
Vehicle looks very nice (black exterior, black cloth top, black leather 
interior).  Vehicle has 55k miles, and seems to drive pretty well. Back 
plastic window looks like it will need replacing in a year or so. They want 
$26.5k, however I'm likely to offer something like $23k. To my surprise, 
this dealer is offering a 1yr/12,000mi warranty on this car.
     
I'm also considering an '86 911, however I didn't want to start a religious 
war by asking which one (911 or 944) was better. Anyone out there 
own(ed)/driven both and have comments on which was preferred?  I'm leaning 
toward purchasing the '91 944 s2 cab because it is decked out with more 
luxury items (it's newer), is slightly less expensive, and has a decent 
warranty.
     
Thanks all for your help.
