>Seriously though can you describe the process and estim. novice labor =
hrs?

The procedure is pretty much as described in the workshop manual.  Tear =
it down, check all the parts for condition, esp. the friction disks and =
pressure rings.  It is important that you measure the case and pack =
heights properly and accurately, install the correct disks to establish =
proper preload on the belleville springs.  You should also check =
break-away torque once assembled, as the manual suggests.

I can do the job quickly 'cause I have the tools and I inventory the =
sized disks, replacement cover bolts (effectively sacrificial, margin =
socket head depth), etc.  You're going to have to do the same, buy a =
nice depth gauge and straightedge, build a jig for testing break-away, =
etc.

BTW, I also rebuild open differentials normally, call me crazy.  The =
conical thrust washers between the case and the small spiders are always =
pitted badly, there's usually enough wear to mandate reshimming the =
large spiders by at least +0.10.  The gears suffer if you don't change =
the fluid regularly, and I frequently replace them.
