in our constitution there is what we call the elastic clause, it says something 
to the effect of necessary and proper. this deals with all the laws not 
specifically delagated. anyhow, this is sort of how the montana law works, if 
the patrol man feels that you are unsafe then he possesses the right to ticket 
you. while there is no speed limit posted that does not mean that we are allowed 
to go out and do 150+MPH, that is not safe to others.  the law is good in a 
sense, however i cannot wait until someone sues the state after a traffic 
related death due to the speed of the other person. i also know that mercedes 
does testing up there and they have already recieved tickets after a fleet of 
sl500's got pulled over at 120+MPH.
