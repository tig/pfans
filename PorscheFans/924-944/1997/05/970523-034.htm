Ben,

Here is how I did it on my 87 944.  First disconnect the
battery.  Then, there were four torx or hex nuts on the
back of the wheel which had to be removed.  At this point,
the airbag should separate from the wheel.  There will 
be a connector with two wires which you remove from the
airbag.  That's it!  

Now, this procedure was derived by simply jumping in and
attacking the problem.  I may have missed some important
saftey steps, and I felt a little trepidation when I pulled
the connector from the airbag.

BTW, if you start the car with the airbag disconnected, 
you will most likely cause your airbag warning light
to activate.  In fact, maybe even just reconnecting the
battery while the airbag is disconnected is enough to
set a fault in the airbag computer.
