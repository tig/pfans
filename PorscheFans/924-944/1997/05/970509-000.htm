Hey Guys,

I had the same problem on my 1984 944.  The problem seems to be lack of
lubrication and use.  To "fix" it, and I'm only talking about if the
trigger is difficult to squeeze, I took a can of WD40 and sprayed the
trigger really good, and worked it in abit, then open the door and on the
inside of the door is a phillips head screw, remove that, and you can now
pry the door handle out about 1/4", enough to spray some more WD40 in
there.  I just kept working it and spraying in, until it freed up.  WD40
is good at freeing things up, but doesn't usually last very long as a
lubricant.  I got some stuff made by Slick 50, called Lube 1, (I know, I know,
Slick 50?) but it's alittle "heavier" than WD40 and seems to last alot longer
too.  The whole process took  about 15 minutes to do...

                                                         -Larry
