I think you may be referring to the rear windshield-wiper button.  It's
symbol looks like a wiper blade sweeping across an arc, so I can see how it
might look like a flag.  If you don't have the rear wiper, it makes sense
that nothing happens when you toggle the button.  But I'm surprised that
Porsche left the button there for an absent option.  I guess your rear-
wiper doesn't work if you DO have one.  I can't think of any other button
that may be described to have a "flag symbol" on it, but I may be missing
something even more obvious.

..... what about the left/right electric mirror selection switch. Pressing
it doesn't move or sound anything but by using the re-po button the left or
right mirror will move. I can't remember what the symbol looks like so I
may be wrong...
Steve.
