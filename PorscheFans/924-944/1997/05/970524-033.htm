Rick and the rest of the group;

I cannot honestly speak of the workings of the 924s as I do not have 
one.  I do have an earlier 924 and found the same noise in the 
approximate center of the car with the clutch out; a noise that 
disappeared when I depressed the clutch.  As the clutch was due for 
replacement and the car was high mileage at the time (230K+) I felt that 
the torque tube was probably shot, and it was.  

Options?  Replace with new: over $2,000 for an '80 (out of the 
question)  Used?  possibly but not preferable to me at the time.  
Rebuilt?  Possibly but the one shop that I found selling rebuilds was 
the same one that I had purchased a used set of rims that were in "good 
to excellent" condition, but arrived with one rim having hit a curb and 
the other 3 needing work, yea I'd trust them again...

How about rebuilding the thing?  I couldn't find anyone that sold the 
parts or did this.  Well, I have and have approx. 30K on the thing- so 
far so good (knock on wood)!  The cost?  About $50 for parts.  Anyone 
can e-mail me and I'll explain how I did it if you're interested.  
Please note though, that since I've done this, an Ohio vendor (IFC 
1-800-YOUR-944) is selling used torque tubes for $99 probably making a 
rebuild of the 924s tube impractical.  

I think the "s" refers to "sport".
