I just got my 88 951 back from the 60k service and the shop informed me
the ball joints are both warn and have almost .25 inch of play. I don't
use the car in track events (yet, anyway, maybe in the future...) My
question is should I replace the joints with factory joints or the
Fabcar arms? He quoted me a price of over $300 each for the factory arm.
Is this something I could replace myself and then have the shop do an
alignment? I have a Hayne's manual, but no factory manual set. FWIW the
shop is "Black Forest, Inc." in Atlanta and I was pleased with the
service they did. They fixed my seat and sunroot and I didn't ask them.
Nice touch...TIA for any advice.
