>I'm relatively new to this list, but have seen a lot of discussion about chipping our cars.  When discussing this subject with my factory trained mechanic at my Porsche dealership (who has also been working on Porsches for 22 years) he tells me "DON'T DO IT".  He says that the slight additional increase in horsepower does not compensate for the greater increase in engine wear and tear caused by the extra mechanical stresses of running the engine harder.  (his definition of slight HP increase is ~30HP or more) He says that in 1985 when my car was built, it was built with the maximum tolerances that were mechanically practical or possible with the technology currently available.  In other words if the engine was capable of producing lets say 250HP stock, then Porsche would have built it that way in 1985.  To go above and beyond the factory technical specifications would be similar to going beyond engineering tolerances and could lead...

From Dana:  Look at it this way.  You have a car that car do 160mph (or
150 or something like that).  Can you drive 160mph?  Could you handle
the car at that speed?  Will the Mustang racing you go 160mph and would
the idiot even have the guts to try?  Why are you racing a Mustang? WHAT
do you have to prove?  Will the slight increase you get from a chip
allow you to drive better, smoother, faster?  Listen to your mechanic,
and my mechanics - the honest ones who are not going to make money off
rebuiling your engine.  Don't chip the engine.  Go out and get the
intake runners polished and your exhaust jet-hot coated.  Get some
Fuch's wheels and put some good leather dressing on the seats.  The
point is, the car works, you have a nice piece, don't go screwing her up
with plastic surgery (unless you get that neat light bar in back that
replaces the license plate bracket and says Turbo like mine!)... 
Replace the water pump and check your belts.
