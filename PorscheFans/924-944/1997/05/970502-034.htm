Greetings.  I have an 86 951 that I love, and that at this time has me
quite baffled.  I would appreciate help in figuring out what the following
could be.  First, I have an clunking noise coming from the passenger rear
tire area.  It seems to go away when I put my foot on the brake.  I can
move the half-shaft back and forth about 1-2 inches, is this normal, or
could it be the culprit.  Second, my car seems to have a problem from
1500-3500 rpm.  It feels like the brake is on or I am towing a large yak. 
After 3500rpm the car pulls like a train.  I have fairly new wires, cap and
rotor, plugs.  Any thoughts?  I have leaky p/s hoses (surprise surprise!).
is there an inexpensive way to replace these?  Automotion prices for those
hoses cost seems ludicrous.  Thanks for your help
