I intend to bring forth a rule submission to make it a requirement in this
this region that there be "x" distance to the timing lights and to
have a certain angle of start so as not to allow the AWD cars to have an
advantage and to reduce the abuse the drivetrains and clutches must take
to make a competitive start.

I also intend on bringing up this point at the next regional meeting.  
Please understand that I am not whining, I made the mistake of rolling
through the lights (it was downhill too!) and only this experience would
have taught me to watch out for that.  I don't think it's particularly
good for the cars running the event to make hard starts though.

Hey Wes, you usually do pretty hard launches, do you think you made the
same error???
