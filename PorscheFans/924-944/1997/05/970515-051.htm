Wha???

The 944 is only the greatest car in the world.
230,000 miles on my 944.  Only problems regarding the items mentioned water
pump replaced twice.
Never got stuck away from home.
Timing belts replaced three times.
Plently of power and torque for me.
Rust only now just beginning to show a little.
The car is just about a lifetime car.
All that for a car almost 15 years old driven 120,000 miles in NYC everday as
a commuter and work car.  And 110,000 miles in the country.  Rain or shine,
snow or ice.  Porsce is there.   This car was by no means babied. 

If this is a German engineering embarrsment  - then what about the hole in
the center of the tiniest bearing thing?
