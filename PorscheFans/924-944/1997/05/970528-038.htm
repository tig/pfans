Somebody asked (regarding to mounting a spoiler)


" Is drilling holes in the glass safe "

It isn't. The glass panes, except for the laminated windscreen are
hardened by a method that puts tension on the outer shell of the glass
pane. The glass will be made much stronger, but as it is prestressed, it
will shatter into (literaly) thousand pieces if the tensioned shell of
the pane is broken.

You may see some small dents on the top end of the glass hatch, near the
frame. These are marks after the holder that held the unhardened glass
when it was dipped int the heating/hardening bath. Any glass with that
kind of marks are most certainly hardened, and cannot be worked with any
cutting tool.

Windshields are usually made up by laminated glass and plastic, and will
break and bend a lot before actually go to pieces. Those can be worked
on, and that is the reason for the practice of boring a small hole to
end a glass split and then make a epoxy repair.
