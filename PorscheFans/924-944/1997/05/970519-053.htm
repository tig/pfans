Hi Steve,

      <<My latest plaintive wail for tire recommendations for my 87 944S
(with standard 15" wheels) has brought forth a string of well-meaning,
I'm sure, but inconsistent particles of information.  I was trying to
determine whether I should (or even could) go to 225 50 15's instead of
the factory 215 60 15's and whether mixing sizes front and back was
important, possible, or even necessary.  I have heard "yes", "no", and
"maybe."  I have been lectured on radius, diameter, and final drive
ratio.   Dire predictions of doom have been issued should I dare to defy
the FACTORY RECOMMENDATIONS!!!!!
        What I really want to know is how your tires made you feel!  How
did they make you look?  Did they improve your love life; your job
performance; your relationship with your children?  Does the stereo
sound better?  My reason for wanting to go to the 225 50's was my
impression that they will look a lot better, and might not affect my
daily driver's performance adversely - is this true?  How about
Firestone Firehawk SVX  or Toyo Proxes???
       Come on people - share your feelings!!!>>

You caught me at a really good time (just found out I'm the proud owner
of an '89 944 Turbo - yay!).

I ran 225/50x15s on my '84 944 for 10 years and MY TITS DID NOT FALL
OFF! So much for dire warnings, and I was really hoping they would fall
off.

Here's the upside:

1) 50-profile tires are way cooler than 60-profile tires. The 60s look
like truck inner tubes in comparison! :-)
2) Your car's ride height will be a bit lower. :-)
3) Your gearing will be a bit lower so the car will accelerate better.
:-)
4) You increase the contact patch. :-)

Here's the downside:

1) Your speeometer will register about 5% higher. But it makes for a
GREAT excuse - I actually got out of a ticket on the way to Laguna Seca
when I told the cop I wasn't used to doing the conversion in my head,
and he saw the tires were new! (He also told me to get my speedometer
recalibrated.) :-|
2) Your odometer will show 5% more mileage than actual. :-(
3) The distance between the top of the tire and the fender will be
greater. The only way to overcome this is to lower the car. (But I still
think the 50s look better on the car than the 60s.) :-|

Looks the upside wins by 2 smileys (3 to 1)!

You didn't mention wheel sizes, but here's my opinion on that too. ;-)
They look slightly bowed-out on 7s, but still not as much as the
balloons you currently have. They look perfect on 8s.

As far as tire choices are concerned, I like the Yokohama A509s - a real
bargain with an aggressive tread pattern, or the BFG Comp T/As. (No
matter what the choice, I believe in supporting the vendors who support
racing.)
