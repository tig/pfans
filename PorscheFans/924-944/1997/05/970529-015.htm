This query is to those of you out there who own or have experience with 944
cabs. I have found that putting the boot cover on once the top is retracted
requires pushing down firmly on both sides of the top. Once this is done, the
boot can be made to secure via the snaps. However, I have also found that
once the top is returned to the raised position, small slits are cut in the
fabric on the rearmost panel. These slits (one on each side, and in the same
relative location on each side) run front to back and are around 1/2 to 1
inch in length. This does not happen if  the top boot is not installed. I
have spoken to several other cab owners in my area and they have the same
problem (although most are not the origional owners and never knew how these
slits occurred. I have contacted Tom Hiser from Porsche Cars Customer
Satisfaction group and he is looking into this issue for me. Anyone with a
similar experience, Please email me directly if possible: ScotDygert@aol.com.
 I'd like to have some additional info to back up my belief that this is a
design problem.
