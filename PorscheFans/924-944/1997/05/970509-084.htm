Thanks to everyone for the help!

It seems to be a consensus that the clutch is going, especially =
considering the vibration problem I have, combined with the "clunky" =
clutch engagement.  My wife is going out of town with the kid this =
weekend ;-) so I should have some time to put the car up and check it =
out.  I paid what I think was a decent price for the car knowing some =
things would need fixed, so as long as the motor is OK I can live with a =
few hundred dollars for a new clutch.  Any good places to look for a =
"spring" centered clutch?  Think waiting till Winter would be pushing =
it?

Thanks again.

Andy,

I am not sure which model 89 944 you have, but if it is not a Turbo, you
would have the rubber centered clutch.  There is a new clutch for the
Normally Aspirated 944 that uses a spring center disk to nit that rubber
decay problem in the butt.  In fact, the factory has a new clutch for =
the
Turbo now, but I am saving that for another post.

When the rubber comes apart, you get two symptoms.  The first is the
"clunk" and the other is an out of balance disk that causes vibration in
the drive line.  That vibration may change some what and not feel
consistent.  However, as a whole it will likely get much worse as larger
chunks dislodge.

To test the clutch you need to jack up the car and remove the oblong =
rubber
plug on the front of the transaxle.  Put the gear lever in neutral.  =
With
your hand (not foot), reach into that opening and attempt to rotate the
drive shaft.  If you feel a significant back lash, then the clutch is =
self
destructing.

Do not let this go as it will continue to degrade and the vibration is
unfriendly to the rest of the car.

All 944 cars require the belt tensioner tool.  The spring tensioner only
attempts to keep the correct tension longer and more consistently, but =
is a
poor substitute.
