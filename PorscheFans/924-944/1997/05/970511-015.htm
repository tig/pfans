Hatch rattle!!!  *argh*


Bschandall,


Ratch Hattle is usually caused by the little pins that hold your hatch down.
 The pins (the two items that extend from the hatch end, and go into the back
of your car) can be adjusted by loosening the lock nut, and twisting the pins
with a screw driver inserted into the slot.  If the hatch is loose, you shorten
the pin...

Identify which side needs adjusting by tugging on the hatch at either side (be
careful of the spoiler and press down and up on the hatch end).  You can
usually feel which side needs adjusting because that side will move up and
down.

As often is as often not...on both 944s I've owned the pins are rusted into
their nuts.  If you take the mount for the pins off (torx 30 or 35 I believe)
you'll find that the pins are in a metal sleeve inbedded into a plastic nut.
 Either get a new nut/pin combo, or carefully freed the pin from the nut.

OR if your hatch is adjusted properly, the rattle could be the glass separating
from the hatch itself, in that case, take the car to a glass shop and have them
re-attach the glass.

Have fun, and hope things work out!
