Hey dudes,

I'm in a talkative mood today.  My insurance claim is proceeding along and I've
managed to somehow get my adjuster to actually argue with the "big company" on
my behalf.  Don't ask me how I did it, but it sure is easier to deal with the
insurance company when someone there is on your side.  Anyhow, what makes the
944 look so good?

It's all in the fenders.  There are very few cars on the road with fenders
that bulge out so much.  I've found that for me, there are only two cars in
this world I would consider driving right now, a 944 Turbo or a 911 C2 Turbo,
both of which have big fenders.  It's that presence when driving down the road
of looking fat that intimidates competitors.  The problem with japanese cars
is that they have too many designers, all trying to perform the impossible,
all things to all people.  Look at the Supra.  They could have made that
a beautiful car, the fenders are literally screaming just to be like a 944's
fenders.  I don't know how many people designed my 944 Turbo, but I bet that
someone said, "that's how I want the fenders so that's how it's going into
production", instead of the Japanese version "that's how I want the fenders,
but the focus group thinks that they should be more like a cavaliers, so we've
modified it by cutting out 4" of bulge each side".  When Mazda tried to copy the
944 with their RX-7, the fenders were almost straight up and down, pathetic!

When re-reading this, it sounds like I like fenders so much that I'd probably
stick on one of those wide-body anzioni's creations, but that's NOT the case,
the ones on the car are as wide as I'd like to go :)

Even when it comes to exhaust notes, the 944 Turbo has a really nice noise,
which is hard to get out of a turbocharged car.  I do have to give a nod
of appreciation to the Italians, I've never had my spine tingle like when I
heard a Ferrari F355 at full bore right in front of me.

The other area of course is that the shape is timeless.  It looks good from
every angle (although I like the 968 bum better), even with the headlights
up (something the japenese could learn from ie. RX-7 looks hideous with the
lights up).  I always get embarrassed when people ask how much I paid for
the car;  they are expecting me to say something like $50,000 instead of the
$30,000 that I paid.  So, what I do now is say "in 1988, it sold for $73,000"
which isn't lying because that's what the PO paid for it.  This keeps the
onlookers happy :)

Anyhow, in the end, that's what I think makes the 944 look so good.  We
should always remember that people change a lot during the course of their
lives and fall in love with many different cars.  Whichever car you currently
own is likely to be the "best car ever made", so to each his own.

PS - I'm picking up that new MOMO wheel I was talking about a few days back.
     I decided on the MOMO Champion because I think it will suite the interior
     more than my ultra racy flat-bottom Monte Carlo F1.  I'll take pics to whet
     your appetite, so you can then buy one for yourself :)

Farzaan.
