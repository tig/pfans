Farzaan,

I thought you handled your reply in a very respectable manner today. I wish
I could honestly say that I would have done the same.  Keep posting because
I think it helps everyone to hear different perspectives about these
awesome cars we drive.  It is up to the person reading the posted material
and make their own judgements.

I have many many hours (make that years) logged repairing, rebuilding, and
restoring cars but I'm very new to the Porsche world.  When I post a
problem or ask a question, I read the replies and use my own knowledge and
judgement as to who gave the best advise - unless it comes from George B. -
I tend to gravitate towards his opinions or at least checkout what he said
first.  But one thing is for sure, this list-server is the most valuable
resource for car enthusiasts I've ever seen.

Regards,

Michael Belfoure
