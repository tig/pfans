> Paul,

I replaced the dash on my old 85.5 944 (same as your 89 sans airbags).
It was a real pain  but not difficult at all. It took about 6 hours to
do. I was able to put everything back properly and it had no squeaks or
rattles. I sold the car to a friend recently and he has had no problems.

I assure you I am far from a gifted mechanic so Im sure anyone with a
little patience can handle this job.
Feel free to email me if you have any questions.

Subject: Dash Replacement

Does anyone have any experience with removing and replacing the dash on an
'89 944 Turbo?

Mine is very cracked, the factory replacement is very expensive, the dash
rebuilders have somewhat reasonable prices but I'm wondering if the dash
can be put back in so that it is close to a factory installation, i.e.
wires all in place, no rattles or squeaks, etc.?

Advise from anyone who's been there before would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Paul Bresk</PRE>
