The passeger mirror fell off my '87 944S and  I reattached it with "krazy
glue". It has held now for 3mos. I don't know what affect it will have on the
operation of the heating elements in the mirror (if any) as mine did not heat
previously either. Don't remember if both sides of my mirror were mirror
finished or not. The driver side mirror has come off and has broken and I
replaced it with an after market "concave" type wide view mirror (dimensions
same as stock mirror). This mirror was hard to get use to as objects seen in
it are smaller than they appear. The mirror is slightly curved and is secured
with double sided foam tape on the back. Not such a neat installation as
there is a gap between the mirror and the flat surface it is attached to. I
don't see how a heated mirror could work with this gap between the mirror
surface and the heating element either. Binswanger Glass said they could cut
me a mirror as a replacement for $20.00. This is much cheaper than the
factory replacement. Hope this has helped you.
