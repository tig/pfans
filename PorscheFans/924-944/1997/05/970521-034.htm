>> Is an '87 Porsche 944 a reliable car or a good choice for a first car?


*****

Yep, I spent 6 long and mostly enjoyable years with a Scirocco 1 before
moving up (way up) to the 951.  Teaches you a lot before you take the
plunge.  The Scirocco would run rings around the 944 up here in the hills
where I live, but you didn't get much respect on the open road, or from the
valet parking attendants for that matter.  It got to the point where I had
done so much to the car to make it "more Porsche like," i.e., removed the
cat, took away most of the smog equipment (really dumb), upgraded the
suspension and generally became a shareholder of Neuspeed stock.  Those
were fun days, all right, and I was sad to say goodbye to my trusty first
car, but the 944 is still "in the family" so to speak, and there is a
little bit of VW in every Porsche, and a little bit of Porsche in every VW!
