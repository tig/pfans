I'd like to jump on into this little love-fest for the early steel =
control arms.  Despite what others have written, it is simply nonsense =
to say that they are more reliable and a better choice than aluminum =
control arms.

Steel arms do break.  We pulled an instructor's car from the woods at =
Bridgehampton a couple years ago after one of his broke.  A heartbeat =
earlier or later and he would have collected a tree, and I think he =
would not have walked away from it all, as he did.  Very lucky man.  =
More recently, Gary W. had a part of his control arm break at the PCA =
Club Race at Lime Rock this year.

The fact that a well-prepared and well-maintained car survives with =
steel arms does not mean they're OK for most folks cars.  Dave Maynard =
has them on his 924GTS, has no other choice really on that car, and =
they've never presented a problem.  But that car goes on the lift before =
every event, gets thoroughly checked, and parts get replaced.

Not all cars which come to PCA driver's ed or club race events are very =
well checked.  Sorry, but that's the truth.  I sent home one friend last =
year who showed up with his car trackside complaining of wiggly =
steering.  Both his tie rod ball joints were junk.  Took me a minute to =
determine that.  His tech inspector obviously hadn't checked.  Another =
car showed up at an event with zero brake pads.  This was an =
instructor's car, tech'ed by a certain region's chief instructor.

By the way, Fabcar arms break too.  Everything breaks with time and =
abuse.  Porsche went to aluminum arms because they know that they are =
stronger and last longer.  Yes, they do not have replaceable ball joints =
and that's a drag.  But for the great majority of street and track use, =
they are by far and wide a smarter choice.
