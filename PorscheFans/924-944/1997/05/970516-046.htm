Arif,

I too have a front engined porsche and a biturbo.  As you say, 
reliability is an issue and thus the reason I use my 924 for daily use. 
The 924 is quite reliable and makes the biturbo fell even better to me 
than yours does for you!  Of course, the difference for me in terms of 
thrust is significant.  The Germans make a far better car, no doubt.  
But there is a "character" thing as you say and so I have held onto the 
Mas for 6 years now.  My other opinion is that the Mas will handle with 
my 924 but offers a far superior ride quality and quietness.  It appears 
to be a far superior car in every way except for durability.  I think 
that if you can hold onto the Mas and buy something else (like a 951 as 
per everyone's suggestions) you'll be happy you kept the Mas.  Ya gotta 
admit that the car's a kick, huh?
