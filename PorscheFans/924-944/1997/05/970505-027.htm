     As stated in previous posts, I have the "Cup Car" clutch disc in both 
     of my 951s (an '87 and an '89).  I can't yet comment about a downside 
     compared to the normal Factory parts.  I'd suggest a call to Engine 
     Builders Supply or Windward to see what feedback they have gotten from 
     customers.
     
     The following parts numbers were on the box containing my discs.  
     Please note that I attempted to verify that a number of 
     suppliers/advertisers were selling these same part numbers as "Cup 
     Car" clutches.  I got 2-3 of them to confirm the numbers, although 
     they were hesitant.  The discs typically ran about $225 when I bought 
     mine.
     
     SACHS part number: 1861 944 433
     Porsche Part number: 951 116 011 09.  I have also heard that 951 116 
     011 07 is the same part.
     
     Again, these parts are not available at the dealers.  Near as I can 
     tell, the other factory clutch parts (pp, throwout and pilot bearings) 
     can all be used with this special disc).

I'd like the clutch (Sachs) part # please & any other clutch advice.
     
I owned an '86 T for 7 years & kept having the darn spring breaking problem 
-- the dealer never indicated that there was anything else available. I've 
got an '89 T now W/27k on it & I'm wondering what I've got to look out for 
next.
     
Thanks for your help.
     
Paul
