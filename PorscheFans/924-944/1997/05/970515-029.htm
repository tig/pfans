I also remember a publication some time back that compared the 968 and
M3. It concluded that the M3 motor should be in the 968 and the
leftovers sent to the dump. The major differences I remember about the
two engines were about the induction. The M3 motor used VANOS ( BMWs
variable camshaft system ) on the intake side for the 286hp motor and a
so called Double VANOS on the 320hp motor ( Both intake and exhaust
cams). The 968 used Porsche's Variocam system on the exhaust side only.
Also the M3 motor had six throttle bodies ( one for each cylinder ) the
968 had only one for its four. It must also be said that the M3 is BMWs
premier sports saloon and the 968 was an entry level car, this may
account for some differences in models.

1)  Does anybody know where I can find articles comparing
the 968 and the M3 (I saw one that included a track test of
968 vs M3 vs Subaru Impreza WRX about 2 years ago but can't
remember the publication)?

2)  I'm no engineer but the M3 (Euro. spec) puts out 286bhp
from the 3.0L engine and 325bhp from the new 3.2L engine
but the 968 only gets 240bhp from its 3.0L.  Does this mean
there's a way to get more hp from the 968 without
turbocharging?
