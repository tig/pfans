I don't think there are many list members out there that would stick a chipset
on their car to "fix" a problem.  From what I've seen, it seems like most 
list members keep their cars well maintained up to proper standards.
I agree that a car that is running incorrectly, (ie, blowing thick blue
clouds of smoke, etc.) should not be chipped, but if a car is running
normally, chipping will not cause any problems.

We have stock chips that we will be testing to get a baseline.  I'm
curious to see stock to stock of the 87 to 89 models.

Now, now Anders, no need to get nasty.  Your tag line explains a lot about
your responses.  Get a turbo car, stick chips in it and I bet you'll forget
all about this blueprint stuff! :)
