> Arif,

While I am a very biased towards 911's I think your best choice would be
a 951.
I love driving my Carrera more than any other car BUT I have to admit
the 951 is a total adrenaline blast, especially at 14+ psi. I dont think
there is any car that gives you that much for such a small amount of
cash

Just my .00002 cents
