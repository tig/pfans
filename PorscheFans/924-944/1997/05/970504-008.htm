The two time I have asked my dealer to let me speak with the mechanic who will 
be working on my car (both for my comfort, and so I can explain directly what 
I think is wrong with the vehicle), I've gotten a very dirty look, and have 
been questioned about my need to speak with him.  Neither time have I been 
able to, as they have made me wait for over 30 minutes and I have had to leave 
to attend to other business...

I'm sure that my description of the problem get's translated from "I need a 
60,000 mile service, and would like the water pump, the belts, and all rollers 
replaced", to "The owner thinks it drives funny, and it has too many miles on 
it, so we should paint it blue".
