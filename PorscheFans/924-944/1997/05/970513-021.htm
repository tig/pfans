You know, when I win the Publishers Clearing House lottery (yeah right -
keep dreaming!) I'm going to build a special race track that is totally
covered like a long tunnel (so no wind or rain problems) so I can drive
160mph whenever I feel like it.

I'll just keep it under 70mph for now here in the south.

Naweed.
