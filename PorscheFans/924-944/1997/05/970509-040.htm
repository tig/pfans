Hey dudes,

The kid that's full of it with too much time :) would like to invite any
Western Washington or B.C. Porsche drivers out to an event being hosted by
one of the local clubs.  I have the ability to bring out 15 cars to this
event from my group.  Two spots are already spoken for (Paul and I).

The event is being held at Mission Raceway Park.  The event is not a Solo I,
but it's also not a Solo II, it's a Solo I.5 :)  The track is a small club
type of track, but we will be using only 70-80% of the track.  You will
start off down the front straight with the timing lights just like Solo II,
then you continue on until right before turn 5 where there will be the stop
box, so kind of a combo event.  The only really hard corner is turn 1 which
is a heavy hairpin left hander that will put a lot of stress on your brakes.

Safety equipment is the same as needed to autocross (Solo II).  I'd prefer
if you have some high speed track type of experience since I don't want
to peel my group off the walls!

Email me at fkassam@direct.ca if you are interested.  Oh, the cost?  C$20
which is about US$15.  We will run from 4:30pm to 8:30pm until it's too
dark to continue.  The date is May 24, 1997.

Farzaan.

BTW - it's funny sometimes when you see how riled up people get over my advice
      It's not like I'm telling people to stick V-8's in their 944's or
      something!
