That sounds like an, er, inventive process.  One which might not be worth
the effort, at least not yet.  Of course, at the rate that the cost of R-12
keeps rising, it won't be too long!

The purpose of the drier is to trap any non-gas refrigerant and any water
that may be in the system.  Since it sits between the condensor and the
evaporator, it's the last stop before the passenger compartment.  If any
liquid refrigerant were to make it to the evaporator (where it expands,
getting even colder), it could possibly freeze, blocking the evaporator and
effectively damping the cooling process.  Another factor is efficiency
since this whole system is based on the heat of transformation (conversion
from liquid to gas and back), having liquid already in the system would
reduce the amout of cooling power.

>...just throwing my muddled thoughts into the pile...

Isn't that what the list is really about anyhow?  That way we all share
ideas and learn together.  Hope this answers your question.  If not, let me
know and I can give more info!
