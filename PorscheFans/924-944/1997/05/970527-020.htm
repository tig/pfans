well, i went to my local DMV and since i live within about 5 miles of four 
different police stations i hit them too. it seems here in texas that the 
officers i spoke to said pretty much the same thing. they dont mind radar 
detectors in a sense, you see they like the fact that as soon as the detector 
beeps you slow down, this is the use of radar anyway, not funding new city 
streets as some have claimed.  when you slow down accidents are less likely to 
happen, therefor they are all in agreiance that radar detectors are a good 
thing. however they all said that unless the person has a VERY good story they 
were at least 2 times more likely to ticket a person with a detector, 1 ticket 
for speeding the other for being too damn stupid to slow down, makes sense to 
me, even though i got one with my detector on. (p.s. it was in my corsica, and 
it turned out that the cruise control was malfunctioning, even got pulled over 
at the same spot 2 times in 1 week, got the ticket went to the dealer they 
checked it and i have not even been looked at since!!!!)  at any rate i would 
think this is the case in most states, as long as you are slowing down and not 
causing accidents then they dont mind the detectors. 

helpful hints:
1.  stay in one lane, it always looks like you are going faster if you are queue 
jumping.

2. dont tailgate, makes it look like you are in a rush and will defintely grab 
attention, not to mention it just isnt safe.

3.  as much as we like our little red jewels, buy black!!

4. the most important, dont speed at all, on average if the trip you are taking 
takes 7 mins usually then going 20 miles over saves you about 1 min, what is the 
rush to go to work anyway????

hope this helps and watch out for those black and white cars with the light 
bars!!!!!!1
