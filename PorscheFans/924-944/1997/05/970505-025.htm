A while back I posted a problem along the lines of:

My wipers do not work for variable speed or the low speed. The medium and high
speeds work but when I turn off the wipers the wipers stop and fail to return
to the bottom of the screen.

I had many helpful replies. It turns out that the problem was with the motor.
In the motor there is a return mechanism this runs in parallel with the console
switch. All I had to do was take the motor out and clean this. Voila, my wipers
now work perfectly. I checked the service records from the previous owners and
this problem has been on the car for he last 30K miles! One workshop diagnosed
it as the relay ($50) another as the console switch. ($180).

I deleted all of the replies so thanks to the people who pointed this out and
for all those who have the same problem its about a 20 minute job!
