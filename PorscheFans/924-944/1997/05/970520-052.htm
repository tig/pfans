 Just out of curiosity, why do the 911's  seem to be more prone to this more
 than the front-engine Porsches?  Gearshift pattern different?  It's
 worrying me (slightly) because the scenarios described could
 conceivably apply to my car, too --
  >>
The gearshift pattern is the same but the linkage certainly is not. 944's are
far more precise than 911's. Much longer, sloppier throw on a 911. Add that
to the fact that in the heat of battle (track or street) the car may be
leaning a bit and you have the ingredients for disaster. It's not only
novices that fall prey to this. As I said I know one Club Racer who rebuilt
his engine 3 times in one season because of missed shifts. This is $$$$ to
say the least.
