Farzaan:

	Everytime I wanted a good laugh, I would always look up what you have
to say.  And this time, I had to reply.  I am a Porsche-fan like
everyone on this page, in addition I do all my own work. I have learn
much from many knowledgeable mechanics (Porsche Motorsport, JME, Brumos
Racing, etc).  Anyway, where you came up with your information is scary.
Factory Turbo rims (89) are already 7.5x16 and 9x16 wide.  With the
addition of one inch, this would make the car hunt (tramlined?), I don't
think so.  You have even stated the tires you were running 235/45/17
front, and 255/40/17 rear, factory 225/50/16 and 245/45/16, this means
the tread width is 10 mm (1 cm) wider front and rear.  It may be the
fact that you have a wrong tires combination or a bad tire.  One
centimeter wider does not make a car hunt.  For example, Pirelli PZero
system uses Direzionale (front), which (in a nutshell) pushes the front
end inward, while the rear uses Asimmetrico, which has a neutral
traction.  This is a great system for 2 wheel drive cars, but Porsche DO
NOT recommend them on the 993TT, because 993TT is a 4 wheel, this
different front and rear characteristic do not work efficiently with the
limited slip bias of the 993TT.  Therefore, Potenza S-02 are the
superior tire for this application.  That is what you have to consider. 
Sure Porsche did not wanted a car to hunt all over the road, you are
absolutely right, but at the same time, they are not going to stick a
bicycle tires on the car for the car to go straight.  It does not matter
which car a wheel is on, if it was fitted correctly.  If a wheel has
problem going straight on the 951, it will also have problem on the
928.  Look at the trend, back when 951 were made, 16 inches rim were
consider big, today 1997, you almost cannot request 16" rims.  17" are
pretty standard, even 18" are not rare.  My point is if 951 were to
continue production until today, bigger rims are inevitable.  More tires
means more contact area per square inch, equals more traction.  More
tires means better grip for your brakes to decelerate.  You sounds like
a kid with too much time on you hand, some of your ideas are OK, some
not.
