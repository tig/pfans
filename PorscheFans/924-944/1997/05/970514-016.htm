<<Don't do it.  My mechanic told me it would leak, but I put one in
anyway.  It leaked.  Not from the threads, but from the ball valve.  The
tolerances on these things are not good enough, and you lose the magnet
to boot.  Don't waste your time or your money.>>

Hmm, I had just the opposite experience. I put one on an '84 944 in 1987
and it didn't leak a drop for 10 years. Since I did my own oil changes,
it was definitely worth it. 

Before the installation, I had to put the car on jackstands to be able
to get under it only to have the plug fall into the waste bucket every
time while the oil diverted everywhere but the bucket until the plug
fell out.

After the installation, all I had to do was jack up one side, slide the
bucket underneath and reach down and undo the latch. Much easier. I did
have thoughts about someone 'sabotaging' my car because it is so easy to
do. But I challenge anyone to actually do it when the car is not jacked
up. There simply isn't enough clearance to reach that far in.

The only drawback is the lack of the magnet. However, I put well over
100K of very hard miles on the car with no apparent damage. I think I
made up for the lack of magnet by doing more frequent oil changes
because it was much easier.

Now, if I could have only come up with a drip-proof way of removing the
damn oil filter without removing the bottom shield...
