Some people really crank the tire pressure up on street tires.  I run what
the factory recommends which is likely 36psi/36psi.  These pressures are 
already on the high side as far as street tire pressures go.  If you have a
decent alignment and don't plow the car too much on your first time out,
you shouldn't have any chunking problems.

The most definitely be put outside the car :)  There likely won't be any place
to put them except in your pit spot.  I find it easier on my nerves to have a 
set of tires/wheels sitting in the pit space than my home garage!

I haven't run into fuel cut out from sloshing in this car yet (89 951), but
since you'll likely be getting lots of runs, you might as well fill it up.
I find the car sluggish with a full tank so I try and run about 1/2 tank, but
some people claim that they can then feel the fuel sloshing around causing
an unstable condition, I've never felt this.

>4.  Is there any other specific preparation for the car before I autocross
>it?  There will be a brief tech inspection at the track.

Be prepared to have fun!

Farzaan.
