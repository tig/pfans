First of all, I'd like to state : I have no experience with the #2 rod bearing.

The "fix" for #2 rod bearing problems is to cross drill the crank at the #2 rod
bearing.  (i.e. adding an additional port for oil to flow through)

I talked to Chris at powerhous (not Cervelli, but the other one) and he
recommended that the crank be cross drilled.  I asked him whether or not that
would compromise the strength of the crank, he said it didn't.

Cross drilling the crank will compromise strength, however whether or not it
will ever be noticeable, I don't know.  It didn't sound like Chris ever had
problems with the cranks bending or breaking as a result of cross drilling.

Also adding additional oil pan baffles is suppose to alleviate the problem of
oil sloshing away from the pickup.  I don't remember the part # for the
baffles.
