     There seems to be a lot of debate over whether or not a broken timing 
     belt on a 951 will cause valve damage. My question is this:
     
     Does anyone on this list have any firsthand experience with a broken 
     timing belt on your 951? Meaning you have ACTUALLY SEEN the bent 
     valves that resulted.(or at least the repair bill from a VERY 
     reputable shop). Stories about a friend of a friend do not count. 
     
     Two local well respected "experts" have told me that as long as you 
     are not running at 6500+ rpm when it breaks there will be NO VALVE 
     DAMAGE from a broken timing belt on a 951.
     
     If anyone has any personal experience this debate could be put to 
     rest.
     
     Thanks,
