Hello fellow P-fans, on my '86 951, I had the same trouble with a hard to
operate door handle. I lubed the handle and it helped some, but it was still
really hard to open. I decided to play around with the striker plate on the
door jamb, because it seemed to me that the door latch may have been binding
on it. I loosened the bolts and moved the plate out a little bit, tightened
 the bolts  and kept checking the operation of the handle until I got it in a
position were it would open and shut the door much more easily. I also made
sure to check that the door was still aligned with the body of the car. Hope
this helps. Colin F. '86 951 with Porsche spyder in dash .
