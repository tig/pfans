Over the course of the last half year my 924 has been getting noisier and
noisier in the back. It's a clunk-clunk kind of noise. I get it when
braking, starting to drive, going over bumps (even in neutral), and today I
even got a constant clicking while going straight ahead at a very slow
speed. It's starting to get annoying, so I want to do something about it.
The problem is - what could the problem be? An acquaintance who is a car
mechanic suggested the rear bushings (they're called "silentbloc" bushings
in the Haynes manual). I have had one of the CV-joints replaced and another
one repacked, and I don't think it could be one of the other ones. It sounds
more like a suspension problem than a drivetrain (is that's what it's
called?) problem. But ofcourse, I'm no car mechanic. That's why I'm
asking you guys.. :)
