I have written some boneheaded stuff on this list, including last week's
"can the auto-tensioner be removed and left off?- it gets in the way."

I only got one response to that one, and I'm thankful that the person only
said "I think you should leave it on." and left it at that.

Well, now I humbly ask, how to remove and put it back on properly for the
purposes of swapping the timing belt. My Haynes and copy of the 1984
factory manuals don't show the auto-tensioner, and the 944FAQ says
something to the cryptic effect:

"Don't remove the three bolts you can see, but do remove the three bolts
you can't see." Now, normally I would freak out with an odd sentence like
this, but after a week under the hood, this odd sentence does not surprise
me in the least. Too late odd sentence, I'm jaded.

+ + +

Of the three I can't see, I think I only saw one, and it did not look easy
to remove.

Can I remove the three bolts I can see to see what I can then see?

My mild theory goes, if I can't see the nut, it will be very tough to get a
wrench on it.
