Hi Everybody,

2 weeks ago I got my first Porsche, an 86 944 turbo with 130k miles.
I love it.  It's much more capable than the other "sports" car I had
(94 Acura GSR). (It's also faster than our 85 740 turbo wagon.)  The car
looks great, has tons of room (I'm 6'4") and great visibility.

Questions:
I heard that the compression ratio on the 951 is low enough that the
valves don't meet the pistons if/when the timing belt breaks.  Is this
true?  (The timing belt was last done at 100k.  How much time does a
reasonably competent beginner take to do this job?)

I live in Santa Fe (7000 feet).  When I floor it up here, I get ~1.7
bar.  Can a new chip get me back up to 2.0?

I think this car has the original clutch.  I've heard about trying to
measure "play" in the pedal, or feeling "backlash" on engagement, but
I'm not sure what either of these really mean.  Do I have to baby this
clutch all the time?  The car has such long legs that I really want to 
slip it in first gear (to bypass some of the "large yak" problem).  
I guess what I'm asking is: On normal acceleration from a stop, about
what RPM do you have when the clutch is completely engaged?

Thanks,
Fred
