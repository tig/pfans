Fans,
A couple of questions, and I feel kinda stupid asking because I having been
a member of the list for a couple of months now, and know that at least one
of them has been answered but can not find the post.  
My car is a 78 924 that I have resurected from a basket case, crank was
trashed.  I rebuilt all myself just farming out the machine work.  Fired it
off a few days ago and still need to get a few of the bugs that it
acculmulated sitting for 6 years exterminated.

Problem 1.  Cold engine, starts immediately.  Hot engine starts
immediately.  Hot engine after setting for about 5 minutes NO STARTEE UNTIL
COOL.  New fuel filter and still same symptoms.  I havn't checked anything
yet, just thought someone might give me a good idea where to start.  

Problem 2:	Start cold engine and at idle RPM around 500 throttle VERY
unresponsive to about 1500 RPM when it hits 1500  RPM and beyond it is very
responsive.  I wonder if these 2 are related problems.
