	I was just curious if anyone on the list has the same problem as I do with
my fresh air vent.  It seems as though the fresh air vent temperature is
always about 10 degrees warmer than the outside air (is this normal, where
is the intake on the 951's).  Then on hot days it appears as though it will
stay hotter for a good 10 mins or more even after the outside temp cools
off.  In other words it could be 50 degrees outside at night after a hot
day and the vent will still blow hot air for a good 5-10 mins before it
even comes close to the 50 degrees temperature that's outside.  I did have
a problem with that plastic clip that holds the heater control flap awhile
back, but as far as I know that's been replaced and is working fine.  Just
wondering if anyone has any similar problems or knows why I may be having
this problem.  

					Thanks, Brent
