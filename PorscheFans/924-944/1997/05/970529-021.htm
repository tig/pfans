Does anyone know if our cars have something called a "Bendix" in our starter
assemblies?  It's supposedly the thing that throws the starter gear into
contact with the flywheel.  My friend insists that every car has to have a
Bendix, but I think he may be mistaken.  I think our cars may have a
different device that serves a similar function but is not necessarily
called a "Bendix."  I hypothesize this because I've heard of a company
called Bendix (I believe they made the ball-turrets on the bellies of WWII
B-17 Flying Fortress bombers) and I can imagine a similar part being
referred to by its more familiar trade-name.  And I've only heard of a
Bendix in reference to American cars, especially trucks.  Can anyone help
settle this little argument?
