Bill, maybe this will make you feel a little better.

I remembered when Conn reversed itself on the radar detector law.  I
just happened to be driving to Conn on business two weeks before and two
weeks after the law was changed.  The first trip I read the sign posted
at the state border and removed my solar powered detector from my
windshield of my 93 red RX7.  Sure enough, one mile down the highway was
a state police car parked looking at every Mass car that crossed the
border.  

Two weeks later I crossed the state border and noted the change in the
sign about radar detectors.  This time I left the detector in place and
sure enough, the same state police car was parked about one mile down
the road.  This time I slowed down so he could get a good look at my
radar detector which at this time was proudly sounding off in response
to his radar gun.  I had all I could do to not point to the radar
detector as I went by him. Boy, that felt good.
