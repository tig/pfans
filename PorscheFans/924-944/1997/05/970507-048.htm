You are absolutely right.  I was being my usual cynical self and I
apologize for sounding too sincere.

I went through this with my State Farm representative and they even wanted
to raise my rates if I went racing with external coverage from another
company (even though they would be exempt).

It seems that anyone that engages in a "high risk" activity is game for
higher insurance rates automatically.

The logic is that people who sky dive, race, balloon, dive, roller blade,
ski, ride motorcycles, mow their lawns without eye protection, skip stones,
drink root beer, smoke, burp, canoe, play guitar, fly, climb, cave
exploration, sleep naked, once saw a rock band, bungie jump, pump your own
gas, trail blaze, snowmobile, shoot, hunt, skip rope, run, bowl, darts,
drinking Mountain Dew, and occasionally do not wear underwear, then you are
considered a risk taker and therefore undesirable to underwrite.

On the other hand, if you're: married with 1.9 kids, one dog, one cat, read
the news paper, pay the neighbors kid to mow the lawn, over 40, under 45,
drive your father's Oldsmobile (better yet, your Grandfather's), drink ice
tea (but only socially), watch TV, own your home, work a desk job, never
speed, have a stamp collection, never eat Mexican, have pet fish, porch
with a flag pool, golf (but never in the rough), buy tires at Sears, prefer
Midas to "Speedy", eat an apple a day, call Mom regularly, support Red
Cross, F.O.P., local church, give blood (but only when shaving), do not own
power tools, knit, belong to AAA, have only wing tip shoes, still have all
your Boy Scout merit badges, far sighted (but could never see the point in
wearing glasses), never irregular, and always, dear lord, always wear clean
white underwear (remember Mom!) and a T shirt, believe that a good physical
workout consists of taking a bath, pulling the plug, and fighting the
current, then feeding the dog, feeding the cat, the fish, falling asleep by
8:30 PM, and last, but not least, brushing and flossing daily; and all this
will get you premium rates with any provider (and those nifty refrigerator
magnets!  Now that's living!).
