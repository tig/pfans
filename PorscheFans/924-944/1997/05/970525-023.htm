Hi folks,

I imagine this is an old subject but I have a few questions regarding the
cam/ balance shaft belts on my 1988 924S (narrow body 944).  My car has the
auto cam belt tensioner. Do I need the special tool to replace the belts or
not. I am interested in hearing individual experiences regarding replacing
these belts this. I put all of the information together and send it out to
the next person who inquires about it. 

A thoughts regarding long term storage would be appreciated. The car has
been in storage since last august and I will only be able to drive it for a
month before putting it up for another 8 months. I have heard some horror
stories related to the fuel system and I want to take the appropriate
precautions during start-up this summer and storage in the fall. 

Given that I am going to drive the little red car for only about 8 months
total spread out over the next 3 years does anyone have any reccomendations
regarding special insurance that might suit my needs. The car needs to have
at least fire theft while it is storage but it would be nice not to have to
take the other components of the insurance off during these times.

This must sound like a strange situation. It is. The deal is that I am
attending the Sackler School of Medicine in Tel Aviv, Israel and the porsche
is back in Ithaca, NY. The porsche is not the only sacrifice these days. I
hope that when I take it out of storage for the last time that it is not
plagued with a long term storage related problems. 

I have the factory manuals and the haynes book for the 944. If anyone is
interested in photocopies of a few pages from the factory manuals let me
know. I would be happy to send them out but I don't have them in hand until
I go home in early July.

One other random Q, will a steering wheel from a 1988 911 fit my 1988 924S.
I allready had it dyed to match before I even considered if the hub was the
same. If it is then the 3 spoke black leather wheel originally from the 924S
is available if anyone is interested in it. 

please respond to my e-mail address directly as I don't allways get the
daily list file.

Thanks.
