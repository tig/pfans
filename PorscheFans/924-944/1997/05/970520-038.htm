Hi folks,

Writing for a friend in Florida with an 89 944na 2.7 with approximately =
45k miles.  Her problem is that intermittently the car will die and then =
after a while will start again, sometimes the next morning.  Flywheel =
sensors are new, car cranks 400 RPM plus, coil is new, new rotor and cap =
fuel pressure OK,  and it is now in the shop without any spark.  Guy in =
the shop (non-dealer and nice guy trying hard and open for suggestions, =
S&S in Del Ray, very reasonable) thinks it may have something to do with =
the alarm because the box was "warm" and the door locks were erratic.

Question:
!. can the alarm be disconnected or jumpered out of the circuit or is =
there a diagnostic procedure to find out if the alarm is telling the DME =
not to give spark, or am I climbing the wrong tree?

2. The DME relay is new and all connections associated with the DME =
cleaned.  Is there something else I should be looking for?

TIA for all the usual help I get from the list!
