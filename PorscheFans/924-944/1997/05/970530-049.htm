Bill, there's a book available entitled "Defense of Speeding - Vascar
Evidence" by Edwin M. Henry, Jr.  He is both an attorney and an electrical
engineer.  My wife (also an attorney) used to work for him (but at our
house, I'm the EE).  The book is probably the most complete compilation of
information on the subject anywhere.  Chapters include "Speeding", "Radar
Summary", "VASCAR", "Legal Defenses", "Statutes and Rules", etc.  Charts,
graphs, you name it, are all included.  I have no idea how much it costs,
and I have never read it (fortunately).  Published by Pairo and Pairo, 800
Court Square Bldg., Baltimore, MD, 21202, but probably out of print.  You
can also look up his phone number in Ellicott City, MD, information (area
code 410).  I don't feel comfortable giving out his number without
permission.  You can tell him I sent you, though.  He had plenty of copies
a couple of years ago.

P.S.  Probably shouldn't mention in court that four million people on the
internet know you were speeding, though ;-)
