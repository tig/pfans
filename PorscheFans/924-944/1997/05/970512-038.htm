>You don't say what year  944 you have or how many miles on this set of
bearings.  This problem can crop up in early (pre 87) It is almost never a
problem in normal street driving providing you use a good motor oil,
preferably a synthetic, and change it at the proper intervals as shown in
the manual. Where it does become a problem in in racing and some high speed
track applications, during hard cornering. The oil can slosh away from the
pickup (the hotter and thinner the oil, the more prone it is) in hard
cornering. For some reason when the pickup sucks air it blows the resulting
bubbles onto the number 2 rod bearing.

>There are 2 easy fixes( but they do not always work) 1. Good synthetic oil,
as listed above. I run Mobil 1 15W-50 in a dedicated race engine. It works
just fine. 2. get a late model pan baffle.  You can also put in a
pressureized accusump(oil resivoir) but this is an extreem measure and is
not practical for street cars.
>
>Do not, under any circumstances, buy the "corrected crank" snake oil. The
problem has NOTHING to do with the crank, and in in fact systemic to the
entire oil system. A cross drilled crank will  at best be a weakend
component, and if not properly doe will create a stress riser that will
cause major damage when it breaks.

>If you had 100K or so on the engine, I wouldn't worry about it at all.
Bearing are a wear item, and do need to be replaced periodicly.
