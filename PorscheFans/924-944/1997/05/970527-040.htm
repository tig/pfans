Did you check your thermoswitch in the radiator??  It is located at the
top right hand side of the radiator as you are looking at the front of
the car.  Be sure that it is plugged in.  Normally when they fail, the
cooling fans run constantly.  

Because there are two fuses (#10 and #15) going to the G10 relay, I
doubt that both of them have failed and since you put in a known relay,
that should not be the problem.  Because you stated that the car had
been recently worked on, definitely check the thermoswith.  It will be a
three prong switch with a rubber boot cover the pins.

Good luck...Don Istook 25 years with Porsches
