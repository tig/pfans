Marc is right on.  I replaced the dash in my 89 951 and had no problems.
 I am pretty mechanically inclined but it was more tedious than
difficult.  I would plan on the car being "down" for several days as you
will no doubt find some trim pieces that you want to replace (some get
very brittle with age and crack easily).  Key Note - with airbags
disconnect the battery and ground your body before disconnecting.  It
only takes a couple millivolts to set these off I am told.  Take your
time and don't rush, it all is very logical and if you get stuck you can
email me or call.

I actually got really lucky and found a brand new leather dash at a mail
order place for $625.  It was black but my local dealer referred me to a
guy who dyed/painted it for me and all is well.

I would be interested in your success with recovering.  I still have my
old dash and kept it specifically because I will someday have another
951 as a keeper instead of a daily driver.
