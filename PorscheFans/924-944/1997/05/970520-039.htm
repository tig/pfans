Hi people,

This is not entirely true Dave.   I visited the factory and museum in '94  I
agree the museum is VERY small considering where it is - However I was
informed that the cars on display in the museum are rotated frequently.  The
company owns many more cars then those on display in the museum but these are
either on loan in other museums or in storage - for example I was surprised
to recently see a car at the Chicago motor show this year which I had
previously seen at the musuem - It was the "first" car built by the factory -
a nice little silver mid-engined pre-cursor to the 356.  Of course we all
know that Porsche built other cars such as the VW and the Auto Union racers
before this - but this car was the first car to bare the Porsche name...   I
must also admit that my friends preferred the looks of the old car to the
Boxster which it was on display beside.
