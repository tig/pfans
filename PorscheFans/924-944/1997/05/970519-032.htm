okay after i had the timing belts done i heard a distinct whirr coming from the 
enigine bay when i asked to speak with the tech he was gone so i spoke to the 
service manager he said the tech wouldnt let it go if it werent right. i said 
that the whirr was from one of two things, now i hope i am correct in one sense 
but wrong in another. it could be the belt is too tight or it is not on 
properly, either way is not good, correct? everything is covered including 
damage done if it fails but i dont want to have my car in the shop for freaking 
ever while they work on it. is this whirr just the break in for the belts or 
something to cause me to worry like i was when i took delivery of it??? any help 
appreciated.
