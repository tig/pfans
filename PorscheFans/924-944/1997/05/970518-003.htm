Hi everybody,

I was reading all the posts on 80mph and thought that those people
in minivans "feel" like they are at home in their favorite chair,not
in a car doing 80mph. They can't feel the road, the speed they are
going, or what would happen if an ememrgency came up. 

I think its a case with most new cars, i just got back from a trip
to Abiline (i live in austin) we took a Neon, which i hadn't driven
before.  When driving it, I couldn't feel that we were doing 110...
My 944 does 110 with no problem but you definitely know that you are
going that fast without looking down at the speedo.  I had to catch
myself in the neon, you just can't "feel" it.

Its a good car, but i was worried about having to switch lanes at that
speed.  In the 944, i have had some close calls at 90mph, you know,
the guy in the right lane comes into the center lane right as you
are about to pass him... the 944, whether jerked or gently moved, never
fishtails, spins, dives, or slides, and will stop whenever you tell it
to, no questions asked.

Though 13 years old, my 944 is much safer than that 95 Neon.
