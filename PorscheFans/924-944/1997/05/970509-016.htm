Most of the people on this list with chipped 951's use them on the track:
either autocrossing, drivers' ed, PCA racing or other, not racing Mustangs
on the street (you don't need chips to do that successfully). In my
experience, my car is no less reliable now than it was before I put the
chips in and I've driven it 65,000 miles and a number of track events since
putting them in.
