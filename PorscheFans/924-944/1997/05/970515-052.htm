Hello Jeffrey.

I am not sure about the first problem you mention - clutch pedal not coming
all the way back up.

The second problem you mention about fluid leaking can become major.  I have
a 1986 951 and when I had my 60K service done, I had the dealer look over
the car bumper to bumper.  They discovered that my clutch master cylinder
was leaking (in fact prior to the service I had to top it off once, which
led me to ask them to check it).  If you don't get it fixed, the leak will
eventually come into the cabin of the car, causing severe corrosion damage
to the metal and anything else the fluid comes in contact with (according to
my dealer).

The clutch parts are reasonable at around $500.00 depending on where you got
them - the labor is however the real killer.  Our turbo cars have a lot more
"plumbing" under them that has to be removed in order to replace the clutch
so that jacks the labor cost up pretty high.  My clutch was replaced at my
dealership who charged about $700.00 for OEM parts and about 24 hours of labor
at $55.00/hour.  Total was around $2,100.00.  I had debated on whether or not
to replace the clutch and just hold off until it got really bad.  My dealership
advised me that driving with a bad/worn clutch would lead to other problems.
I don't know if that is true or not (anyone else ever heard that? if so, what
are the other potential problems?).

If memory serves me correctly, I think my labor charge for replacing my motor
mounts was 3 hours or so @ $55.00/hr.

Hope this info helped you.
