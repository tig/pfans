Hi All,

I guess you guys are a little biased, but I'll ask anyway.  I 
currently own a 85.5 NA 944, and a Maserati Biturbo 425i.  I just put 
the Maser back on the road after a long and harsh winter, and now have 
a dilemma.  The 944 feels like a much more capable car overall.  It is 
definitely better built (big surprise there), and is easier to drive 
fast and hard because of its handling.   But the Porsche is missing 
two things: the wonderfully addictive thrust when I put my foot down 
with the Maser, and what I can only describe as that delicious 
combination of sights, sounds, and feel that I call CHARACTER!  I 
haven't had the Porsche out on the track yet, but I think it will 
probably out-handle the Maser given the neutral competent feel ( 
upgraded to turbo suspension, brakes and wheels).........

My reply:

WOW!! I wish I could see your in box soon; people may get a little crazy
with their response. What most will say is punt the NA and the Maser and get
a 944 Turbo. I agree. You have not put the 944 on the track, that's a
mistake. The 944 sings on the track and you will never find a better car for
this, yes even the 911 (sorry 911 fans). What your NA lacks is what you
want, POWER. You words are: 

"The wonderfully addictive thrust when I put my foot down  with the Maser,
and what I can only describe as that delicious combination of sights,
sounds, and feel that I call CHARACTER!"

I call this POWER and esthetics. Your current 944 may have the some of the
Turbo goodies, but not the motor, that's what you need. I have driven the
NA, Turbo, and 911 on the track, and the Turbo was by far the best. The
problem with the 911 is to get one that comes close to the 951 is going to
cost big bucks. This may be an issue as you said "should I trade both." The
price to play with a 951 can be between $8k-20k depending on what you want.
The price for a 911 that comes even close should be a good 993 that will
cost about $45k+. So now what to do? You can sell the NA, buy a Turbo and
maybe keep the Maser to turn on the chicks who know what it is, but I think
the cost of carry on the Maser is too high. Another solution is keep the NA
for track days and rides in the sun, punt the Maser and buy a 300ZX like
some others have (DO NOT DO THIS) to deal with the 'esthetics' thing. I feel
that if you drive a 951 and see what it has to offer you will see there is a
great deal more to the car and you will realize what power is. The other
good thing about the 951 is if you feel it needs more power all you need to
do is chip it. 

As for the esthetics thing, that's personal. I think if you drive the NA or
the Turbo on the track you will see how "pretty" she really is. Get up close
and personal with her, show her you love her, throw her into an off camber,
decreasing radius turn 15-20 MPH too fast and see how "hot" she really is.
You have looked under the mini-skirt of the Maser and it was not too pretty,
come back from the dark side, you will not be disappointed.
