      I recently posted concerning the seemingly common idle problems with
my 87 944S (stalling or bogging down on deceleration, "hunting"...etc).
These problems are frustrating because they seem intermittent, and some days
the car runs great.  I received several messages re: cleaning the idle
stabilizer which requires removal of the intake manifold (purchase a new
gasket - $18.95).  The procedure is to remove the hoses connected to the
stabilizer and spray it out with brake cleaner.  Blow it dry or let it dry
and reassemble.  Problem is that removal of the intake manifold, for those
of us who own the 16v "S", and are long on courage, but short on knowledge,
is not well documented by Haynes.  Anyone care to mail or post a
step-by-step for the "S"??  
      I also know that, the last time this happened, the mechanics were able
to solve it by replacing a bad boot between the air filter and air flow
meter, and adjusting the throttle body screw.  Is there a secret as to the
screw adjustment?  Finally, what would be the chance of this being a bad O2
sensor?
