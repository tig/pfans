Steve,
      I replaced the wheel bearings on my '86 NA 944, and used the following 
procedure. I use a carpenter hammer to remove the hub cover, pry it off as you 
work your way around the cover. Once you have the hub removed, you can do the 
following:


1) Cut a 6" section of ~1" steel pipe. (I used a section of steel pipe from 
one of those cheap barbell sets) Cut a notch in the end of the pipe (see crude 
ascii drawing below). The notch will help keep the pipe seated on the race 
while you knock it out. You want the notch to be deep enough to sit on the 
race, but shallow enough so the pipe doesn't touch the sides of the hub, you 
don't want to damage the hub..

    ||             ||
    ||   Pipe      ||
    ||             ||
    ||             ||
    ||             ||  
    ||           || 
    ||           ||

2) Heat Hubs to 150Deg. C (~300 Deg. F) in Kitchen oven
3) Remove hot hub #1 from the oven with leather gloves. Place the hub on a 
concrete floor, drive the old races out with your steel pipe and hammer. Be 
careful not to scratch or otherwise ding the hub. If you place a piece of wood 
or other soft material between the hub and concrete floor, you will dampen the 
force of your hammer blows, making the job more difficult. You could try a 
piece of aluminum.
4) Place hub #1 back into your oven
5) repeat 3 & 4 on hub #2
6) Trim the ends of the steel pipe to remove damage from removal process
7) Remove hub #1 from oven, clean, lubricate with tapping
fluid,carefully drive new races in
8) repeate 7 on Hub #2

All in all, this took me less than an hour, including removal and 
installation. I would highly suggest heating these hubs.  Driving the races 
off the first hub took about 5 minutes, and a bit of force.  By the time I got 
to the second hub, it was at a higher temp than the first, and took about 45 
seconds!  Heating makes a big difference in the amount of force needed. This 
is an interference design which relies on the different thermal coefficients 
of the hub and races.

Let me know if there are any questions!

Also, it would be great if we could add this to the FAQ. Perhaps you could 
refine the above instructions as you go?

Thanks,
       Ezra
