     Dear Porschefans,
        I FULLY agree with Kevin; having changed upwards of 50 timing belts 
     in the time of driving all kinds of (sports)cars, I have never used 
     the belt tension tool.  This is a very straightforward simple engine 
     which is why it lasts so well.  I'm comparing this with some 
     motorcycle engines, and boy I LIKE working on the porsche!
        Anyway, the belt can be changed easily in an afternoon by a 
     competent home mechanic without having to remove the dreaded 
     crankshaft pulley.  The auto tensioner can be manouvred using a set of 
     large allen wrenches and a lever (give me a lever and a suitable pivot 
     point, and I'll move the world) which is also readily done without the 
     special Porsche tool.
        Just because it has Porsche written on it, and the parts are 
     expensive (unless you buy from George B.) it doesn't mean that 
     everyting on these cars is *COMPLEX*  I use it for commuting upwards 
     of 80 miles a day commuting, and enjoy 28+ mpg.  In two years of NA 
     944 driving I've spent *MAYBE* $300.  Now with the 951 things may 
     change...
        I've owned a 944 with 256k miles, one with 144k miles and my 951 
     has 127k miles.  As long as they've been looked after these cars will 
     repay you 150% in the long run.  Buy a thrashed one and it'll cost you 
     150% more...
     
     Cheers,  Jan
