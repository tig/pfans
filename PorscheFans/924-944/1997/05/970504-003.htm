For the last two weekends I have been working at solving my sunrof
problems. The first step I took was to compile every post on sunroofs sent
to the list since Feb. 8, when I joined porschefans(23 legal sized pages).
Using the info from the posts I started digging in.

When I started the roof worked as follows:
Key position 2 - roof opens normally and motor stops when roof is
completely opened
                             roof closes but motor does not stop when it is
closed(levers retract completely unlatching roof)
                             also roof opens by itself whenever car is in
motion
Key position 1 - pressing switch to close position opens roof
                             pressing switch to open does nothing

Things checked so far:
1)  console switch - took it  out and it tested fine - no problem there
2)  tested wiring to switch - power to one side in key position 1, and to
the other side in key position 2 - no
     shorts - everything seems fine here too
3)  tried adjusting microswitch at back of the car - no change in
operation. however,while doing so I discovered
      a part in the track that I could slide back and forth that wasn't
attached to anything
4)  removed the entire drive assembly and discovered that the loose piece,
which is what activates ther micro
      switches, was disconected from the drive cable.  AHA!   this is
obviously the problem.
5)  COMPLETELY diassembled motor,clutch, and track assembly (since I had it
out anyway)
      a) Cleaned and regreased everything.
      b) tested both micro switches - they work fine - no problem there either
      c) inspected all the wiring and tested for shorts - everything is fine
7)  with a feeling of great accomplishment at dicovering the problem and
fixing it I reassembled everything and
      tried the roof

Now the roof switch worked backwards when in Key position 2. pressing
switch to close roof opened it and vice versa. Since Chris White spoke of
having the same problem once he got his roof working I decided to follow
his lead and reverse the wires to the motor. It worked!!! Now for the first
time since buying my car I have a sunroof that ALMOST works perfectly.



Current operation is as follows:
Key position 2 - roof opens normally, but I now realize that the
microswitch at the front of the roof turns the
                             motor off before the roof is completely open.
Question - Is there any adjustment for this?(other than stuffing a
matchbook between  the lever and the switch)
                            roof closes normally and stops when first
microswitch is actuated(latched position)
Key position 1 / roof open  - no movement pressing switch in either
direction. I'm assuming this is normal.
                             roof closed and latched - pressing switch to
open position retracts the levers allowing the roof
                             to be removed  but the motor continues to run
against the clutch instead of turning off as it
                             should.
Question - does anyone know how I can get the motor to shut off when levers
retract
                             Pressing lever to closed position - no movement
                             roof closed & levers retracted - pressing
switch to open position - no movement. Pressing
                             switch to closed position - levers extend to
latched position and stop.

Any help with these two remaining problems would be greatly appreciated.
Without  the info I've already gotten from the list I'd have never gotten
this far. Thanks a million guys!

Just a quick footnote befor I say goodbye. The  brass adjusting nut for the
clutch was almost flush with the face of the gearbox housing making it
extremely difficult to adjust the clutch. So when I put everything back
together
I added flat washer with a slightly smaller diameter than the adjusting nut
behind that nut. Now I can get a wrench on the nut making it much easier to
adjust the clutch.
