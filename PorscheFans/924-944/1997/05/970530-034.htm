  Although I have the workshop manuals, I was thinking the other day about the 
plight that individuals without the manuals are in, and their unavailability, 
and all. (Well, the manuals aren't everything, but they do help) There have 
been discussions about making copies,a CD ROM etc.. but all have been stifled 
by copy-write concerns (at least to my knowledge). I don't know much about 
copy-write laws, but I don't think it is against the law to make personal 
copies of material that has been legally purchased. For example, backup copies 
of software, etc.. So here is my idea. If you want a copy of the workshop 
manuals, you buy the $18 micro-fiche, and send it to someone on this list. 
That person would then send back to you the fiche you sent, along with a 
hardcopy of the workshop manual (or a CD ROM). This would be like paying 
someone a nominal fee to create a "backup" copy of your fiche. I am not 
suggesting that someone print out every page on their fiche reader, but 
instead that a hardcopy manual be copied. Sending the fiche would act as proof 
that the end user had purchased the copy-written material.

Well, what do you think? Any lawyers out there?
