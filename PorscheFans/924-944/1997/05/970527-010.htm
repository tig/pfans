Try the thermo switch in the radiator. There are two wires connected to it,
and if you short them the fans should come on. I don't know where it is
located on your 968, but on my 924 it is in the upper left corner of the
radiator (left=drivers side).

If it works, perhaps the thermostat won't open.
