Hey,

I know some of you stereo guys have the answer to this one. I need to 
attach
a beefy wire from my subwoofer amp to ground. It needs to be short so I was
wondering if anyone has drilled into the floor of the rear hatch area. This
is scary because of the fuel tank and all being down there. If anyone has
done this successfully, please let me know. I guess I'll also have to strap
down my subwoofer box if I ever do driver's ed. I really don't want to put
any more holes in the car than I have to.

I also just mounted my CD changer in the right rear storage well. It was a
pain in the butt, but it was worth it. I'm getting closer all the time!

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
