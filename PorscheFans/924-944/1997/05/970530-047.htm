Mark, I tried fitting one of those full length, multipoint harness seats
in the back of my 944 and it fit surprisingly well.  I'm not talking about
the standard Fisher-Price style seat, which don't fit at all.  This one
was tall, and made mostly of expanded foam with a plastic shell (like most
bicycle helmets these days).  It was tall, but surprisingly narrow, and
fit the seat contours beautifully.  Anchoring it was the apparent
challenge, and the front seat would not have full travel once the child's
feet extend past the edge of the seat.  Once the little tyke is older, the
Gerry booster seat fits, but not with the crossbar/seatbelt bar attached. 
You have to use just the bottom, plus the car's shoulder/lap belt.  The
back seat of a 944 is so narrow, you'll be surprised how well the shoulder
belt fits on a 4-year old without a booster seat at all, though the law
may not allow it.  Sometimes you just have to be your own judge.  Good
luck!
