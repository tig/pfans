I have Bridgestone S-O2s on my 89 951. Excellent everywhere, wet, dry
etc. Fairly stiff sidewall as it has a big fat rim protector. RE-71O has
stiffer sidewall and more conventional tread pattern. I'm told S-O2  is
better tire of the two. I was also told by many different tire shops,
who could have sold me a more expensive tire, that this was the best for
any money. Excellent above 100mph, superb at 150.

Richard.
Don't work for Bridgestone, only like their tires.

Ezra -- Here's some input for you on tires. I've got the Dunlop SP8000s
on
my S2 and have no complaints.  They've been quiet (no squealing under
heavy
driving), have 10 K miles w/out undue wear and hold well in the rain.
The
ride is comfortable, and no vibration problems indicating they're out of
round.  However, I'd like a street tire w/ a stiffer sidewall, if
anybody
has any suggestions.

 -- Nick
