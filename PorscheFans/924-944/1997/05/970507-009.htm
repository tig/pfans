Sounds like a pretty good car to me. My car (87 951) had a similar incident
with the timing belt (at the dealers, during test drive after replacing the
belt) and since then has gone about 65,000 miles with no problems. In fact,
it has probably helped some because the head gasket was replaced at that
time and I haven't had head gasket problems yet.

My son bought an '89 that had been hit but had been repaired correctly. The
car is not only beautiful, it performs extremely well and has given
excellent service. IMHO, the '89 was the best 944 Porsche made. 

The car you are looking at sounds like it has had most of the service
reasonably required performed recently. But...since you are in Pinellas
County you should take the car to a mechanic for a complete inspection
before you buy it. Also, review the service records carefully (if
available) and read the FAQ's to get an idea of the things that usually go
wrong with 944's. There are at least 2 independent shops that will inspect
it for you for free, or you could take it to one of the dealers in the area
(I don't know if they charge for pre-purchase inspections or not--probably
do). The independent shops are Dave White's in Tampa and Eibell Performance
in Clearwater.

Once you have the car, join PCA. We have an excellent club here in the
Tampa Bay area and would love to have you. I'll get you an application if
you like, just send me a message with a mailing address.

Good luck with your purchase.

Mike
