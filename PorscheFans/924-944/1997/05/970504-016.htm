May 1st has come and my silver pcar (86, 951) is on the road again!!!:) One forgets. after a winter of 
driving an Explorer, just how quick and fun these things are. My first full day (today) it rained. I 
still took a drive on route 71 from Starved Rock State Park, East to Ottawa (sw of Chicago) and had a 
ball, a little SliPPery though. On Thursday, I took it to Auto Werks, (why can't forign car dealers 
spell)a Porsche, Mercedes, Jaguar dealer in Rockford, IL. Anyone in Chicago region should check these 
guys out. I got a 4 wheel alignment, timing belt adjustment, pluged it in to the computer and several 
other minor things for under $150! I spent the entire time with the mechanic as he worked on my car 
and hammered him with questions. Then went into the parts room BEHIND THE COUNTER to check out their 
inventory and get to know the parts guys. While there, I was also invited to drive a new Jaguar XK8 
and a 911C2S which they knew I was not going to buy. The parts guys say they can get (quickly) 944 and 
951 shop manuals and charge only about $320 for the ful set. They also have backstock on lots of parts 
(computers, gages, suspension parts, body stuff, you name it) for all Porsches, that they will sell at 
their cost. I know this sounds like a paid commercial announcement; however, I have nothing to do with 
them except as a customer. But at a time when so many dealers treat customers so poorly, it is very 
nice to find one who goes out of their way to do good.
