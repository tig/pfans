Jeffrey --

You'll be getting the same response from many, and I hated it too when I
had a late '85. But get a Turbo, an S2 or a 968.  Nothing you can do will
give you the power improvement you can really feel, short of supercharging,
which can present problems if you don't prep your engine correctly.  You
might be able to squeeze another 10 hp (maybe 15) w/ decking the head (or
Euro pistons, which nobody can get ahold of), a chip, test-pipe and
cat-back, a K&N filter, maybe a Web-Cam performance grind.  Getting rid of
the flap throttle body helps turbos a little, but won't do much for a NA
engine.  Smaller diameter tires might give some gain in acceleration.
There's always nitrous, but that's far from fool-proof.

Keep in mind that Porsche produced the 944S w/ 16 valves and 190 hp in the
2.5 liter engine, and the general consensus was that the modifications
didn't really add enough to the performance.  You won't be able to come
close to the S engine by modifying your 8-valve.
