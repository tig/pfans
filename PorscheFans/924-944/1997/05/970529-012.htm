Here is the latest problem with my 86 951:

It has pulled to the right since I bought the car last year, but the PO
said the problem could easily be fixed with 4 wheel alignment.  I figured
that I would hold off until the 90,000 mile service this spring in order to
get $50.00 dropped off the price.  Howerver, when the car was in, the
dealer said that he could not align the wheels becasue the sway bar was
bent.  He suspected that the car had run over something earlier in its
life.  Can the sway bar be bent back to its original form?  What part
number should I use to replace it if need be?  Should I buy used?  Can this
be done in my garage?  

Also:  I have a leaking clutch hose.  My dealer showed me the hose when the
car was on the rack.  It does not seem to be listed in any of the main
parts books (Tweeks, Auto Atlanta, Performance Products, Automotion).  The
hose is pretty much in a vertical position and located near the front of
the car and pretty much in the center.  The dealer said that the hose would
run about 100.00.  Any ideas on what hose this is?

Jeff
