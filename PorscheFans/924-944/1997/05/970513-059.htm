Jay - where the heck have you been?  It seems as though it actually took
you weeks to wax that damn car, not hours.  I expected you to join in on
some of the recent strings with your always insightful (or should that be
inciteful?) commentary.  Nice to have you back.  Why not save some time for
me next month.  I'll be going thru big "D" on my way to Parade, and my car
sure could use a good (read "any") wax job.  And, it isn't a dark color, so
you should be able to buff out the streaks without any problem.  Just
e-mail me directions to your house and let me know what time dinner is
served.  I'll even bring the liquid refreshment (I was brought up on
10-2-4).
