No, no easy way.  If you cannot legally transmit in the radar bands then
that is out.  Laser can be jammed legally, but I don't think anything
commercially available is worthwhile.    VASCAR cannot be jammed as the
system is completely passive and uses timing marks and what is basically a
stopwatch.  VASCAR cannot be detected by any means except by checking your
six and watching on-ramps and bridges.  As with all PD systems, they are
line-of-sight and if you keep your eyes open you will stand a good chance
of seeing the police.  Don't weave in and out of lanes, don't travel in the
fast lane passing everyone, keep to a safe speed, keep your eyes open.  If
you must outrun (ha ha) the PD, be sure you are a LOT faster than them as
you must get ahead of the interceptors.  Never let the PD get in front of
you!  (Right - good luck at that.)  Best guess, a fast superbike as cars
are not able to evade and accelerate fast enough.  Best advice, keep a good
radar/laser detector (Valentine One) onboard and stay within legal reason
when possible and practical.
