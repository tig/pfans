I strongly recommend the D40 M2s.  I had them on my 944S before I sold
it and they were GREAT!  The grip was wonderful, they drove in the wet
as if the road was dry, the comfort level was great and the noise levels
were low.

I had the same decision to make when I bought the Dunlops and decided
against the Yokohama's because the sidewalls are very stiff and will make
the car ride a bit like a truck, whereas the Dunlops do not ruin the ride.
