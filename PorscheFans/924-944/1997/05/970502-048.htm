        The 944 series has a lot of good design qualities going for it.
Besides the fenders and curves, I appreciate the small details that accent
the overall appeal of the car.  For instance, the pop-up headlights are
probably the best-looking ones ever designed.  If I was in any other car,
I'd be embarassed to drive with my headlights raised in the daylight.
Probes and Firebirds have those nasty square lenses with huge, pointy
"eyebrows" over them.  The 944 headlights are soft and round, and when
raised, don't detract from the lines of the car at all.
        And the mirrors are beautiful museum pieces by themselves.  Can
anyone else name a car with more attractive mirrors in the 1980's?
        How about the wheels?  944's had some pretty unique wheels in their
development.  Following the Fuchs-look cookie-cutters, came the phone dials-
a very distinct and original design that looks aggressive and solid.  The
forged 7-spoke wheels were also handsome, as well as the classic Fuchs that
were available.
        Both the NA and Turbo/S2 noses are sleek, and the taillight lenses
are awesome (I love following other 944's, just to see those oval brake
lights illuminate).
        And although it's a shame that our sunroofs don't "disappear"
electronically, I'd have to say they are the biggest ones I've ever seen.
Porsche designed a coupe and targa at the same time!
        We are all lucky to be driving cars that still maintain a level of
aesthetic appeal and freshness today.  Porsche definitely had their #@*&
together when they designed these puppies.  I am not at all jealous of the
newer designs that pull up next to me at stoplights (i.e. Camaros with
double-square Caprice-Classic headlights, Batmobile Firebirds, aluminum foil
RX-7's, you get the point...).  Maybe they look better from the side or
rear, but I'm only used to seeing their front fascias in my rearview mirror!  :)
