Well, I do agree with Steve somewhat and see where he is coming from, but I'll
explain my logic.  I'd much rather push my car 10/10ths (11/10ths sometimes :))
on a factory Porsche wheel, rather than a replica.  The 16" Turbo S wheel is
also very light and any 1 pound taken off at wheel speed is equivalent to
taking 3 pounds off the car body in terms of acceleration.  I put up the
wheel weight figures a while back comparing my race wheel/tire combo to my
street wheel/tire combo a while back and it was significant.  Also, in racing,
looks don't mean too much to me, so I'd rather use the "chick-magnet" (I'll
admit that's pathetic) 17's for the street.
