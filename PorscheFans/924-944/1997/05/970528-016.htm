Greetings.  I am slightly confused here.  Am I reading right that I can
replace the aluminum A-arms on my '86 951 with those off a VW Rabbit? I
have been told that my ball joints are 60% worn and I am not thrilled
with the fact that I have to replace an a-arm just to replace a simple
ball joint.  I have always thought that racing was the best way to
engineer great cars.  Most things on race cars can be dissected to see
how they are wearing, and are rebuildable.  Why is this not the case
with our phenomenal Porsche?  This ball joint debacle almost seems like
a farce.  What were the engineers thinking? My  car doesn't seem to like
me this week.  My muffler fell off, my hatch won't open (it pops halfway
using either the key or the electric release but no amount of force will
open it.  I feel like I am going to rip the spoiler off! Any ideas?),
and I have an odd smell and smoke coming from my engine.  It looks like
it is coming from above the oil filter, but under the metal shield under
the exhaust manifold by the first cylinder.  Any ideas?  I also have
what looks to be cooked and baked on oil surrounding the closest
cylinders exhaust port.  Is that blowby?  Anyway thanks for the help.

PS Does running without a muffler hurt my car?  Does it give me more
power?
