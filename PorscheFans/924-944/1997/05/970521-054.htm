No, this fan will always be blowing some air.  If you don't want to feel it,
then use the sliding levers to direct more air to the windshield and floor,
or close the dash vents themselves with the vertically sliding lever between
the 2 center vents and the horizontal sliding levers below the vents nearest
the doors.

Yes, this is normal.  Just remember to unlock before turning off the car, or
don't lock your doors.  At least you can raise your windows with the car of
as long as you don't open your door!

As far as I know, there's only supposed to be one, and another list-member
has already discussed the weight's purpose.
