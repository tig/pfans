I just changed my waterpump.  I have 144K on my 86 951, and the pump was =
original.  It was not actually the pump that was a problem, but the =
paper-like seal between it and the block.  Anyway, I vote for a NEW =
FACTORY unit.  I have heard too many stories about having to replace the =
rebuilt units 2-3 times to get a good one, and after replacing it once, =
I never want to do it again. =20

MY SECRET TECH TIP!: By the way, the new pump will require that part of =
the rear plastic belt cover to be cut away (revised pump housing).  But =
my advice is to cut the rear cover in half, which with a Dremel, is =
quite easy.  The beauty of it is that you don't have to remove the =
balance shaft or timing belt rollers and all that, which you other wise =
have to do (if it ain't broke, I bet I can break it).  If you are going =
to do a seal job, this won't save you time, but I was not, so it was a =
deal.
