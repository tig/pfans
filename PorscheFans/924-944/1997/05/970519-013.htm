Any advice with the following problems:
1. Rough Idle. I'm going to work on the idle stablizer, but with the 944 S its
hard to get to.
2. Strange vibration between 2000 and 2300 rpm (with or without loading the
engine). When driving the car gently jerks around these revs.
3. Hesitation during acceleration. The car dives down (like a brake) the engine
makes a dugh-dugh-dugh type noise/feeling (missing) for 3 - 5 seconds and then
surges with a mean acceleration. This effect is becoming more and more common.
4. The rough idle is leading on occasions to a stall after acceleration. I used
to be able to catch it (hit the pedal a little) but now there are occasions
when the car has decided that it is going to die, if I take my foot of the
accelerator, no matter what I do.

I recently replaced my spark plug wires (old ones were arcing) and had the fuel
filter replaced. I also the checked the plugs which were slightly whitish? I
intend to work on the fuel system this weekend. Any advice/pointers is (as
always) greatly appreciated.

Cheers, Robert. 944 S (87).
