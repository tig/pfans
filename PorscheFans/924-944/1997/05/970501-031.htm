When I was in high school, I saw my first 944 on the road. Previously,
I had been in love with Trans-Ams (Smokey & the Bandit) and Camaros but
I was converted instantly. Sure, the Italians are good looking, and so
are 911s. Still, IMO 944s have SOMETHING that is lacking in anything
else out there. We are all lucky to be in the driver's seat of such a
great car! I'm gonna run out and look for that issue tonight (in my
car!).

I also play guitar, and I feel the same way about my Les Paul. After I
wax it up, sometimes I just sit there and stare at it on its stand. And
on a nice day you're just as likely to catch me peeking out the window
to get a look at the car (it looks especially good from the 2nd floor).
My girlfriend used to think I was nuts, but now she'll pick 'em out of
traffic before me lots of times. "Wow, a TURBO at 11 o'clock" she'll
say. I'm going to go home and give her a kiss.

Later,
