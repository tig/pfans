1.  Disconnect the battery for about 25-30 minutes before anything
else     is done.
2.  Center the steering wheel
3.  Remove the two torx bit screws on the back side of the
steering         wheel (I think that they are #25 or 30)
4.  Pull the airbag assy. away from the wheel, carefully disconnect
the     red wire connector...place the airbag in a SAFE (preferable on
the      moon) place with the explosive side down. 
4.  Remove the steering wheel nut and washer and pull off the wheel. 

Installation is the reverse, except...BE SURE AND CENTER THE SPRING
LOADED RING on the back of the wheel.  I think that it is four turns
from the left, but if you count the turns to lock left and right before
hand from center, you can figure it out.  Basically, you are putting the
spring device in the center of its travel.  Also, you don't have to wait
25-30 minutes to hook up the battery.  DON'T TURN THE IGNITION ON WITH
THE AIRBAG DISCONNECTED AND THE BATTERY HOOKED UP.  YOU WILL CODE THE
SYSTEM AND HAVE TO PULL CODES AND RESET IT.
