In my PCA region, all autocrosses are flying start so that we don't have
drag racing starts. In fact, since I have a 951, I wouldn't participate in
autocrosses if they required that type of start because I don't think I
could keep a clutch in the car. 

Autocrosses are not very hard on brakes. The runs are so quick that even
though you brake hard, it's not possible to get that much heat generated.
Tires, however, are a different matter. It is quite easy to flat spot a
tire at an autocross if you aren't careful (BTDT).

It's only my opinion, but I suggest you talk to whoever organizes your
autocrosses to see if they won't change to a flying start so that everyone
will be able to protect their equipment.

Mike
