When mine was having idling problems it was because the idle-speed
stabilizer was bad.  When I replaced it, it idled fine.  Likewise, if you
have removed the rubber boot between the air-flow sensor and the throttle
body, your car will also idle like crap.  Double check that everything is
tight.  If the computer doesn't get the right information about what's
going into the engine, it won't idle.  Since you replaced the belts I'll
remind you to double-check that small rubber hose from the cam belt cover--
it's easy to forget.

Sounds like you just need to adjust the metal hatch fingers (attached to
the glass).  It appears they're not extended far enough and aren't engaging
the holding fingers.  As for simple and cheap, the latter surely doesn't
apply to Porsches, but the former certainly can.  For me these cars are a
marvel of engineering, despite the occasional hare-brained things like the
original motor mounts.  They are relatively simple and cleanly designed.
For example, I look under the hood and find adequate room to work-- just
about any front-drive car is a nightmare by comparison!  No siree-- give me
the 944 any day over these front drivers!
