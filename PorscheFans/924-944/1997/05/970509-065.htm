Well folks I have reached the half way mark in the job (almost).  First,
thanks for everyone that responded to my requests on removing the bolts
(triple square cheese heads) that hold the clutch on.  I got several
recommendations such as drilling, welding a nut on the end of the bolt
(good one!), and a chisel (another good idea I had overlooked).

I would like to say that I used all of them, but I grabbed a 5/16" Titanium
twist drill.  I lacked the welder and my chisel assortment is near zero.

I was anxious to get the clutch off to see both the condition of the
flywheel and the nature of the failure with my clutch.

The flywheel is fine and feels smooth as a baby's... well you know the
song.  The clutch seems to have undergone a multiple failure.  First, one
of the small springs did shatter at the end.  Second, a number of loose
ball bearings dropped out as my throw out bearing decided to show off the
wonders of its inner workings.

I had always wondered what the failure mode for a noisy throw out bearing
would be.  I am now of the opinion that they should be replaced when they
raise their voice in agony.

I am still waiting for the 12 mm triple square socket to remove the
flywheel.  I had planned to send it out next week for inspection and
resurfacing.  Unless the tool appears this Saturday I will be out of time
to get it done.  I had hoped to turn the wrenches around next weekend and
finish the job, but that delay, coupled my work and school schedule will
probably thwart my efforts and I may have to wait until well into June for
my next window of opportunity.  If I miss that one I will have to wait
until August when I finish my 5 week crash course in chemistry.  This
sounds very depressing to watch half the summer slip by without my new toy.
Fortunately I have another 944 normally aspirated car to drive.

On that subject, I would just like to say that the 944S is a wonderful car,
but it seems like I am dragging a 2 ton boulder behind me after driving the
Turbo S for the last few months.  Any one that is considering upgrading has
my complete support,  Believe me, you will love it.

Thanks for every one's help!  I would not have been able to do any of this
with out your contributions.


Marv
