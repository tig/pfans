It seems that most people don't use chips when they go to track events.
 (unless everyone is lying to me)  I did not find anyone who admitted to using
chips at the track.  I wouldn't suggest using an aftermarket chip at a track
event unless you know specifically what the chip does.

Most chips do the following :

increase boost
increase fuel
advance timing

All of these are varied throughout the rpm range and throughout the engine
load.

Of the three, I feel advancing the timing is probably the worst.  Motronic
already tries to advance the timing of the car to its limits.  I don't really
think you need something else overiding how far the originial DME advanced
timing.

I don't think increased boost is all that bad.  But, with more boost, more fuel
has to be delivered to the engine.  For the low part of the rpm range, I
believe that chips can provide adequate fuel to the engine.  As for high rpms,
I don't think the chips can provide adequate fuel.  The computer controls the
pulse width of the injectors to provide more fuel, but at high rpms the
injectors can only be open so long before the next cycle that there simply
isn't enough time to add more fuel.

This is where a rising rate pressure regulator would work well.  At high rpms
when the fuel is needed the most, the pressure regulator increases fuel (I
believe most pressure regulators work off the vacuum).  At lower rpms the
computer can increase the pulse width to add more fuel, and keep the optimum
ratio of fuel to air.

I believe Weltmeister is now shipping some of their chips with fuel enrichment
devices.  (I'm not praising or condoning welmeister, it just seems to be a good
idea)


> 2. Change your oil every 3000 miles with a quality synthetic.

This is a good idea.  I personally don't use synthetic.  I change my oil about
every 1500 miles, so I don't think it (for me) is worth spending the extra
cash.  For cooler climates, however, synthetic is a *very* good idea.
 Synthetic doesn't contain the parafins that oil does, so it doesn't thicken as
much as oil does in the cold (I'm not saying parafins are the sole reason that
oil thickens).  The parafins also crystalize in extreme cold...which is bad.

Yes!

Yes!  :)

My feelings are on a street car, chips aren't going to affect you much unless
you are at WOT every where you drive.


I recently attended my first track event last weekend.  Rather than bore
everyone with the details, I decided not to post my experiences.

However I'll post some anyway.

I have a 2.8L andial engine with a k-27 turbo, and no cat.  I ran stock chips
at the event.  The event was at Brainerd Minnesota.  Brainerd boasts that it is
the fastest track in the U.S.  It has a 5200' straightaway, and turns 1 and 2
can be taken at full speed by many cars.  I think most fast cars took 1 at ~135
mph, and 2 at ~120 mph.  Atleast that is what my instructor did in his '89 944
turbo.  A couple of cars lost it on turn 2.  One 911 was totalled.

Since my car was running lean, I used the DME enrichment switch to enrich the
mixture.  I initially set it at 6% over the norm.

While my car was fast, it didn't feel any faster than my instructors '89 951
(on the straight aways).  I experienced odd engine shut downs during the day.
 My engine would simply quit, as if it were running out of fuel.  The moment of
the car would restart the engine, and all would be well.  This happened usually
in 3rd under WOT.

Annoyed by this, I changed my spark plugs.  My plugs were fouled with gasoline.
 I changed the enrichment device to 3%, and changed plugs.  (the device
controls pulse width)   My car had noticeably more power, easily spinning its
wheels in second under power (not during the shift into second, but higher up
on the rpm).

My car still suffered some problems where the engine would shut down, however
this only happened once, the next day my car did not suffer the shut down.

The concensous was that my engine was simply running out of fuel under
acceleration.  I'm going to change my fuel filter and see if that helps for the
next track event.

The nice thing was, I could easily pull away from the other 944 turbos.  After
a run someone came up to me and told me that he couldn't keep up with my car, I
told him why.

The bad thing was, on my last run I could barely keep up with the other 944
turbos.  I could not generate any more than .1 bar of boost The good
thing...that three spoked vacuum line near the 1st cylinder had lost one of its
lines.  A simple fix (just plug it back in)

I recently called Andial to see what the guy said to use as chips.  He seemed
to think the stock chip would be fine if I increased the fuel delivery.  I
guess I'll leave it in.

Have fun!
