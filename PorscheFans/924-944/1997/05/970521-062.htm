Glad someone brought up the questions about the 944 turbo cycling valve.

The way I understand it, the stock wastegate is set to 1.2 bar and the
computer bumps that up
as it deems necessary to the 1.8 bar limit.  This way, if the computer has
problems or it looses the 
manifold pressure line, knock sensor etc. it will limit it to 1.2 bar.

It bumps it up by applying pressure to the spring side of the wastegate.
 This pressure is from the cycling valve and banjo bolt.

I've driven one car when I was shopping for mine that would pull only 1.2 all
the time.  Figured 
it had problems.

A drilled/jetted bolt, I would think, would only effect the rate the computer
controlled the boost,
not the maximum amount available.

Greddy  makes an computer that runs just the cycle valve and makes the boost
fully adjustable.
Don't want one on my car (kinda like an engine lifespan knob!) 

All that said,

My car also is a 1.2bar till 90% and then 1.8bar WOT.  I can get 1.4 or 1.6
but it doesn't take much movement in the last inch or so to change it.  Makes
for quite a different personality than my 931 where you add 1/4" of throttle
and as the RPM/boost increases you end up letting up the throttle back to
where you were and are still accelerating.

I've dug through the list and still have not found the comparison test on the
different chips.  If someone 
could send it to me I'd appreciate it.

Thinking about doing it.  I drove an 89 S chipped and scared myself. It came
on in the last inch too and I  almost gave a Toyota a Pcar enema.

I'd like some of that in my non S 88.

Just one more question. 

 What are the internal differences in the engine on the S's.  Seems like all
I've heard is the valve sizes.  That being the case is a 270hp  chipped non S
any more prone to failure than a 260hp S car.

Comments 1bar 951 owners.  I'd love some input.
