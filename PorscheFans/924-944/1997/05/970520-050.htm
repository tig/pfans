The part in question costs about $300 plus/minus $50 depending on source
and connections.

Now is the time to do it. Usually failures occur anytime after the 60K mile
mark... 

Definitely a backyard mechanic job... I figure about one hour to remove
the valve cover, remove and replace the tensioner and replace the valve cover.

Once you have replaced the chain tensioner, I would recommend removing
and checking it every 15K miles (looking for wear and cracks in the plastic
ramps...)

The sound that the chain makes is the sound of dollars flying out of
your wallet (similar to sending your son to an ivy-league college or 
planning a wedding for your daughter...)  :-)

Seriously, when a belt or chain or camshaft failure happens on a 16-valve
944S or 944S2 motor, it usually bends a valve into the head, where the 
head just happens to be weakest, and breaks the head. The part number for
the head casting is 944.104.013.03 and lists for $4,429.95 from PCNA.




Good Luck!
