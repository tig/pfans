The only thing that really pisses me off about getting a speeding ticket
(knock on wood - it's been about 6 years) - is I never see a cop doing the
speed limit.  I can be going 75 in a 65 and a cop will blow by doing 85
without his blue light on.  I know n NC and GA, the law states if a police
officer is exceeding the speed limit they must have the blue light on, I'm
not sure about other states.  How many cops do the speed limit while
driving their personal cars?  I hate to slam to police, because I do
respect what they do - there isn't enough money for me to do the job.  But
they should lead by example.  Then again, in Atlanta, if a cop is doing 70
in a 65, no one will think twice about passing him.  

There are some cars on the road that aren't safe at doing 65.  I see junk
on the road all the time and wonder if they had to brake hard, could they.  

And, what is a greater risk to public safety, my 944 at 80mph, which is
properly maintained and built for high speed, or a truck driver at
70-75mph, driving a 40,000-60,000 lb load down the road, on his 20th cup of
coffee working on his 20th hour of driving.

Just my $.02
