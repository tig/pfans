Since I just learned a whole bunch about my 944 in the last few weeks, I
thought I'd use a little Schoolhouse Rock to set the tone for this message.

To put this in perspective, I must reitterate that about two months ago, I
owned zero tools. No hammers, no screwdrivers, cetainly no toolbox or
"special tools". Two months, two toolboxes and several special tools later,
I'm a certified shadetree mechanic (CSM)!

I have new brake pads/rotors, new oil cooler seals, new radiator, new
hoses, new belts, new low temp t-stat & fan switch and the usual gaskets as
needed by the depth to which I plumbed.

I owe much thanks to everybody on the list, and in particular: Tony
Stevens, Mike Crossfield, Ezra D.B. Hall, Dave Cooley & Doug Donsbach.

Well, I sat nervously in the driver's seat Saturday afternoon, fiddled with
the clock and bit my fingernails. Running out of excuses, I gave the ol'
key a twist. I knew the fuel pressure was not going to be there, so I did
not expect the engine to fire right up. It didn't. I tried again. Same
result. I tried again. Same result.

Alright, now I was going to go for it. Hey, it started!

Scenarios raced through my brain. If I screwed up the timing belt, I should
know by now. Is that a shudder? Is the car coming apart? No, everything
seemed fine. I got out of the car and stared at the motor. Ah-hah! Smoke!
Increasing smoke! Damn, quick shut it off! Eeeek! Stick my head into the
engine compartment and start sniffing. Smelled like... a strange mix of
Simple Green and oil. I know the oil smoke comes from residue on the
exhaust, so I was calmed- if that was it. Fetch my sister. "I'm gonna start
the car. Tell me where the smoke originates from." She stares. I start the
car. She calls out "from the back" and points to the region I know as the
oil on hot exhaust spot. Excellent. Nerves calming by the minute.

I am listening intently for weird noises. It sounds different. I can't say
if different is better, yet. Nothing wierd. Proceed to bleed cooling
system. I start to think,  "what else I can do?" Oh, yeah, drive the
Porsche! I had forgotten that I can drive the car! Porsches are to be
driven, and I am going to drive this one. The fans kick on, the cooling
system is complete and functioning. I rev the motor by hand via the
throttle, and it sounds good.

Roll out of the driveway and creep down the street. The car is covered in
tree sap, and I can hardly see out the windshield. Take a couple of laps
around the neighborhood at a slow speed. Seems good.

Take the car home and give it a quick wash and then a more extended test
drive down some access roads near my house. No fool, I had the cell phone
with me. No problems.

A couple of days later, this much is true:

I think I did the balance shaft belt perfectly. The idle vibration is
completely gone, and there is almost no vibration while driving.

I guess the timing is dead on. The previous hard acceleration hesitation is
completely gone. The idle and acceleration are smooth, and the cars runs
real well and much stronger in all situations. If there's a problem,
nat=FCrlich, it is right here. The belt is just a little too tight (just
under 5 on the gauge, not 4). Not a lot, but who really knows what a lot
is. It just needs to hold out about 1500 miles more so I can get back in
there and check it again. Hopefully it will loosen up.

I still can't believe it, though I'm thrilled to the core.

Again, thanks to everybody for putting up with my weeks of questions. I got
the understanding I needed to complete the job, and the tips I got from
this list were certainly invaluable. Without the list, I would not have
even contemplated this job. Now I've completed it.

Thanks.
