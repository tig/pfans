TO: The Porsche Oracles
FR: Rick (87  924S)

Amazing...the more you poke around your car, the more you find that
needs attention.  Little things that need attention that you enjoy
tinkering around with.  Gee...gives a new meaning the words Tinker Toy. 
Anyway, had a couple of questions....

1. Bought my 924S off my Dad and it has spent the majority of its life
   down in Florida (hence zero rust, which is nice).  However,
some        things like rubbers and plastics take it tough down there in
the 
   Florida sun.  So the question is...what type of glue can you 
   recommend I use to replace the honeycombed foam shielding that was
   formally adhered to the underside of the hood and is now turning to
   power and powdery chunks and falling onto the engine?

2. Before I use the glue, should I use actual Porsche foam replacement
   or should I substitute with something similar?  If a substitute, 
   what type of material do you recommend?

3. How often should the transmission and differential have
the             lubricants changed?

4. The A/C needs recharged with refridgerant.  The system appears to
   have zero in it at the moment.  Dad said that it may have a very
   slow leak.  Are there any common leaky spots or is it a case of you
   find it wherever they may be for your particular leak?

My appreciation in advance....to the Great and Powerful Porsche Oz from
this humble Porsche rookie.  Rick
