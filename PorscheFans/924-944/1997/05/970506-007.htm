Hi Todd,

> Looking for advice on auto-x helmets - style, manufacturers,
> discount mail-order

IMHO, if you are going to buy a helmet today, you should buy one that is 
SA 95 rated. That way, you know that your helmet will be accepted at ANY
PCA event, and is a very safe helmet.

That being said, there are still a lot of variables. Try to decide on what
exactly you are going to be using the helmet for. If it's just auto x,
then you could use either an open or full face helmet. A full face helmet
is safer, but open face helmets are cheaper, and more comfortable. If
you plan on eventually racing open wheeled cars, then you need a full
face helmet, and might as well buy one now. For PCA driver ed events,
a full face helmet is recommended, but not required.

Personally, I would only wear a helmet manufactured by Bell, Simpson, 
or Shoei. Prices for a helmet manufactured by those guys will range
from around $180 to over $800. The price of the helmet is determined
mainly by the type of helmet (open vs closed face), and by the shell
material (kevlar vs fiberglass). Kevlar is lighter than fiberglass, and
is more money. If you are going to be wearing the helmet for long periods
of time, like in an endurance race, then the kevlar helmet would really
be a good idea. For short periods, like autoX or PCA driver ed / racing,
the fiberglass helmet would probably be OK. It's up to you.

If you do not know your helmet size, buying a helmet mail order is a
very bad idea. You need to try on a number of different sizes in order
to determine which fits. Look in the yellow pages under racing, and
you'll find some places that sell SA helmets. Or call the tech chair-
man in your region. I'm sure he could recommend a number of shops.

If you do know which make, model, and size you need, then the cheapest
mail order places are Racer Wholesale (800) 886-RACE, located in
Roswell GA, , Pegasis (don't know the number), Northstart Motorsports
(800) 356-2080, located in Wauconda, IL, and OG Racing (800) 934-9112,
located in Manassas, VA.

FYI, I have a Bell Mag 4, SA 90, open face. I bought it last year from
Bill Love at OG Racing, and paid $160. Frequently, Bill has specials
to eliminate 'old' stock, You can save a lot of money that way.
