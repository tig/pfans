I have had mine 944 (same engine) as a 'daily driver' for 7 years, and
had some lifter noise two years ago. I then changed to Mobil 1 (15-50,
as there are other viscositys too) and it made the lifters much less
noisy. They seem to pump up real quick, and not leak as quick either.
This effect was not instantaneous, but came rather gradually. I found no
(extra) leaks when changing, and I had up to that time used Castrol RX
20-50 oil - wich I think is a pretty good Dino oil.     

As for Teflon (Slick 50 et al):

Most automotive lubrication experts say that Teflon is no good, some say
that it even is harmful, a few say that it doesn't do any damage.

The Slick 50 people are the only ones saying it is all good.
