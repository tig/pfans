-- [ From: Richard Luker * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Thanks to Marv De Beque and other contributors to the list I have at last
got the sunroof on my 924S working as it should in time for the UK summer.

The problems turned out to be a defective "Radio relay", the microswitch at
the front of the roof panel had an open circuit and the clutch was slipping.

The wiring and mechanical diagrams in the Haynes 924 manual were a great
help (same as the 924S and early 944) but my experiences changing the front
microswitch may be of interest. You will need a soldering iron to disconnect
the wires.

The microswitch is mounted at the front center of the roof opening and is
operated by a tongue fitted to the sunroof panel. Gary Goelkel helped a lot
by explaining how to adjust the position of the tongue, I would never have
found the hex screws.
To access the switch remove the roof panel, unscrew the deflector (two
screws each end) and unclip from the center. CAREFULLY unclip the loose flap
from the center moulding and unscrew the single screw which holds the
moulding to the roof.   Behind you will find the little white microswitch
and connections that are too short to make the job easy.

My microswitch was open circuit and needed to be replaced.

Thanks again to Marv and all who posted notes on the sunroof.
