There are four different part numbers:

477.863.517A Left Hand Side, with inner square (17.5 mm rim breadth)
477.863.518A Right Hand Side (17.5 mm rim breadth)
477.863.517B Left Hand Side, with inner square (16 mm rim breadth)
477.863.518B Right Hand Side (16 mm rim breadth)

There are also suffixes for Black (05T), Brown (89S) and Burgundy (9MM)
for the larger (older) covers.


Good Luck!

Subject: 951 blown head gasket

Hey all,(long)

Just got back from a weekend flogging my car at Mid-Ohio, and
discovered  my head gasket isn't quite right.  In fact, each run session
caused it to lose around a pint of fluid.  We put a catch bottle behind
the headlights to find out how much it was losing.  Kind of depressing,
but I now have an opprtunity to learn more about my car.

Could those of you who have done head gaskets on your 951s send me any
advice/cautions you may have for doing this job.  Are you guys using the
Turbo S headgasket or some sort of aftermarket deal?  I will be taking
the car back to the race track ASAP(probably Summit Point at the end of
the month).  Currently, I am running Autothority's version 2.7 stage II
chips, and the car has 58,000 miles.  I do take the boost bolt out for
the track.

I plan on doing the belts and possibly the rollers while I'm in there. 
I also will be replacing the rear cam tower seal, and most likely doing
the o-rings for the oil-cooler.

This car is very fast and very smooth!  I took a ride in a couple of
others over the weekend as well...  My observations:  The 911 is a lot
more tossable than the 944.  Because of the inherent nature of the
design, the car rotates very easily in turns, and turns very well
because of it.  It is also more labor intensive to control.  The 944 is
a lot smoother than the 911.  The 951 is very quiet and deceptively
fast.  Even super blue brake fluid boils when learning how to brake
these cars efficiently (Cool brake kits are recommended)

When you get "madness" right your car shifts four feet to the right...
whoa!

My car has been chipped a long time and this may have contributed to my
head gasket failure.  In other words, you got to pay to play.  I am
leaving my chips in, but looking for a set of stock chips.
