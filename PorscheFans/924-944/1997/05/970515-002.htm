Just what is prudent?  I have lived in the South East section of
Pennsylvania and witnessed the same behavior.

Here in Dayton there are roads where the same phenomena takes place.  Those
roads have varying "public" speed limits.  Rush hour is by far the fastest.
Later at night, it settles down to speeds closer to those posted.

This is exactly opposite of what would be "prudent" judgement, but that's
the psychology.  I have tracked along one Minivan traveling at 93 mph while
carrying on with a cell phone conversation.  Clearly this is ridiculous.  I
am driving a car that runs rings around the Minivans in every way, yet I
know that rush hour is not the time for high speed.  This gentleman was
traveling 20 mph faster than I am comfortable with on that road.  My
comfort level is not dictated so much by my car, but those around me.  It
makes me wonder if my vehicle has a particular performance envelope, how
can some one push a vehicle with an inferior envelope so much faster?

The really sick part of this is that this is not really a self correcting
problem.  That is, stupid people do get killed, but fate favors that
incident long after they have successfully breeded and made their
contributions to the gene pool.  Go figure.
