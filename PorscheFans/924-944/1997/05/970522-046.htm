In my last post, I mistakenly stated that the drier blocks non-gaseous
refrigerant, but after some consideration, this doesn't make sense-- the
compressor forces the refrigerant from gas to liquid and then lets it
expand back to a gas form in the evaporator inside the passenger
compartment.  That only leaves the water moisture issue for the
receiver-drier to handle.  Les Hatton also caught this error (thanks!).
Sorry for the confusion.
