Naweed,

Mornin'.  In responce to your question on detonation.  PRE-detonation is
when the cumbustion reaches full power (explosion) before you piston has
reached top dead center (TDC), refered to as "pinging".  You car, along with
all others, have and initial ignition advance set at some degrees before
TDC.  The reason for this is that when the spark plug fires, it takes a few
miliseconds for the explosion to reach full power, and you want this to
hapen just as the piston is starting to go down.

Octane ratings of fuels are mostly misunderstood.  The higher the octane
rating, the slower it burns.  If your car has a pinging problem under hard
acceleration, run a higher octane fuel.  If your car does not ping on, say,
87 octane fuel, you will NOT gain any horsepower by paying 20 cents a gallon
more for 92 octane.  A good rule of thumb is run the lowest octane fuel that
your car will run on with out pinging.  I do suggest a major company though,
I stick with the mid grade 88 octane Chevron.

I realize that some of you purists out there swear by ultra high octane
fuels in the thought that since you are driving the finest car on the
planet, you will only put in the most expensive fuels.  I swear to you, you
don't have to, providing it does not ping.  I have no experience with
turbo's though, well, except for an old '86 Saab (what a sob story too), you
may benifit more from highter octane because higher cumbustion pressures.
