It seems as though you have answered your own questions in your first
paragraph - you did well at one set of pressures and not so good at
another.  Remember, all cars are different, even though they are same model
and might even be set up similarly.  Also, driver style varies greatly, so
a setup for one driver might not work the same for another.  Granted,
because of the very stiff sidewall construction of the R1's, you can run
much lower pressures than street compositions, but there is still a limit
due to all of the above (don't forget ever-changing track conditions as
well).  You might try marking the tires with liquid shoe polish, an easy
way to tell when you have reached and not exceeded the "rollover" point.
Also, keep accurate records in some type of logbook so you can compare
track conditions, weather conditions, pressures, run times, even tire temps
if you can get hold of a pyrometer.  The most important thing, however, is
to keep your driving style consistent, and change the car setup to gain
maximum advantage accordingly.  Hope this helps.
