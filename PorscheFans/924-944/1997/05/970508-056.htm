<< Sue for what, they can not sue for your opinion regarding the service
 provided. Remember that a bad experience takes at least  20 good
 experiences to change the opinion of the client. If you go to a
 Restaurant and you have a crappy service, you say that to your buddies
 right?? Hey we're pals on the list with the same love P-Cars, and we
 care about the service someone do in our babies!!! >>

I wholeheartedly agree!!!  The last I heard we still had free speech in this
country.  I'm not a lawyer (I'll leave this to my brother-in-law) but I think
that you have to have malicious intent to prove libel or slander.  As long as
we're just giving our opinions to whoever is willing to listen, and as long
as we're not just writing things to cause damage to someone, the information
is just that . . . . . our OPINION.  Nothing more, nothing less.
