>5 years ago I had a wreck on my old Honda, rear ending a GBI agent who
>was on a "ghost" car stalking someone who after leaving the red light in
>a hurry, slammed on the brakes to turn left in a gas station, of course
>without using the blinkers.... ( common thing down here - guess is even
>a state law..).
>I got for 3 grand in repairs and 45 bucks for inatentive driving... by
>the way requested by this agent to the trooper who came check the
>wreck...
>I was asked at the time if my radio was playing loud, if I had a car
>phone or even if I was reading something..outrageous!!!!!

>I'm a ham radio op (KA8QZG).  I saw this Cadillac driving crazily a few
>years ago and called in his 
>license number to the Patrol, followed the Caddy, guy in the Caddy saw me,
>forced me off the road.  Turned out he was an IPD officer late to work.  We
>ended up with a Sheriff, the Patrol and him all standing around
>trying to decide what to do to whom.  This is a short version of the story,
>but the Patrol DID
>ask me if I wanted to file a complaint against the IPD officer.  The moral
>is this, do NOT
>put up with anything from these guys.  Be polite, be forceful, ask for a
>Supervisor to come to 
>the scene, go to the station if you have to, get all names.  The police
>will think you are a complete 
>jerk but they are human and make mistakes.  In Indianapolis we have had
>several fired and suspended lately for drunken fighting, pulling guns
>without justification.  They have a hard job, and most do a good job, but a
>significant number have a real attitude problem.  Now I have an attitude
>problem too.
