OK, speaking as a former Parts Manager for one of the largest Bobcat
dealerships in the country (we sold John Deere too), the bendix is usually
described as the entire worm gear assembly that engages the flywheel.  If I
remember correctly, some even have some type of clutch to allow the gear to
dis-engage the flywheel.  Most equipment (Bobcats included) and tractors
(nothing runs like a Deere) use a variety of engines.  From Ford 4 cyl gas
to Kubota 4cyl diesels to Detroit diesels (read GM), etc.  No matter what
type of engine I'd see, most starters look almost the same and most all of
them had some sort of "bendix' replacement kit.  Hope this helps.
