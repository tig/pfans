According to the Haynes manual, under the Tune-up and Routine Maintenance
section (Chapter 1), the cooling system bleed plug is located on the upper
radiator hose water outlet (illustration #33.11).  Unfortunately, as most
of us have discovered, this may not hold true for all models, and I can't
get to my car right now to check it out.

BTW, the photo shoot on my car yesterday took 4-1/2 hours at one of the
Chicago lakefront harbors - kind of like watching paint dry.  I'll let the
list know how everything comes out.
