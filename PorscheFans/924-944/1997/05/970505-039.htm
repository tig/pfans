I was thinking a bit about how to go about doing the ratings on Porsche maint 
places and though it would make more sense to rate on several catagories.  What 
I need is some input on those catagories (Ratings from 1 - 10).  I've come up 
with:

	1)  Overall
	2)  Engine Work  (need more detailed breakout?)
	3)  Body Work  (need more detailed breakout?)
	4)  Mechanic's Knowledge
	5)  Customer Service Experience 
	6)  Price/Performance (if they were expensive or cheap, were they worth 
it?)

These are all very general catagories and I could use some input as to whether 
or not to get more detailed.  My personal expertise is geek-related and 
definitely not mechanical so I'm not completely sure what to even ask.

Lemme know!
