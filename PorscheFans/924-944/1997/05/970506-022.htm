P-Fans,

I'm at the point where I'm almost getting a sense for what affects the
handling on my S2 on the track, and would appreciate input on tire
pressures for BFG R1s.  We all know that R1s behave the opposite of other
tires, i.e., drop pressure to make them stick better, etc. BFG recommends
34F/32R psi as a starting point for a car w/ 944 specs. Some drivers run as
low as 25F/22R psi.  My car seems to do well at 29-30F/27-28R psi. I
dropped down only a few psi (28F/26R) on the track and the car felt a bit
squirrely and I lost quite a bit of tread on the outside of the front tires
in comparison w/ the loss at higher pressures.

Appropriate tire pressure depends on many factors - suspension setup,
driving style, 944 model - but I guess my main question is what are the
upper and lower limits of psi that people are using? You're supposed to
drop pressure to improve traction, but there must be a point where tire
rollover, even w/ stiff sidewalls, has got to start occuring. And an upper
limit where the car is too stiff and the wheels are sliding.

Anybody w/ one of the heavier 944 models (Turbo S, S2 or 968) have any
opinions on this subject?

Thanks --- Nick
