After reading Kevin Sigrist tale of woe I thought I would repost this
message from Jim Pasha about the chain tensioner problem. Jim had sent
it to the old porschephiles list:
=====================================================================
To: porschephiles@tta.com
Subject: 944 16V heads, etc
Status: R


The 944 16V head should be very reliable. I do, however, recommend
inspection of all of the inner workings at each 30,000 mile service
based on the info many of the Porsche repair shops I speak with have
supplied me.

The primary area of concern is the plastic chain guide for the transfer
chain and tensioner. The damage I've seen extends past just bent valves.
That's the lucky failure. The reason that the valve cover should be
pulled is for the gradually failing plastic guide because this failure
could allow the chain to get into the head casting. If the chain breaks
while eating metal, it will cause more damage to the head, possibly
ruining it past further use.

PCNA has been tracking failures reported to dealers, they have been
relatively few, most likely due to the fact that most Porsche owners
rely on 3rd party maintenance and PCNA does not track information from
those locations. I'd suspect a simple audit of the chain tensioner
 sales would be more helpful.

Brian Scudder and Kevin Gross have been engaged in exchanging data on
the 16v heads. I recommend to any 944S, 944S2, 968 or 928 with 16V heads
to have the covers pulled at the 30,000 mile checks and the tensioner
and
guide inspected. I would do it at the 15,000 mark if your car has over
 70,000 miles.

What you should look for:
    Any cracking or obvious damage in the plastic of the guide.
    Any evidence of the chain making contact with the head or any
    other metal part.
    Excessive slop in the chain. When the chain stretches, it can
    cause wear or damage.

    Replace anything that appears to be worn or damaged.

Unfortunately, the plastic guide is sold as a part of the tensioner.
