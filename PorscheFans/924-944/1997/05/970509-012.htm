If you have a situation where you have power to the coil and, alternately,
good spark and absolutely no spark, then you have a computer sensor
problem, not a coil problem.  In the 944, the computer controls when the
magnetic field collapses (generating the spark) and won't do it if certain
sensors aren't giving it good information.  For example, I strongly suspect
that the 944 DME won't fire the plugs unless you meet a minimum cranking
speed.  Another problem is the flywheel sensor pickups-- both of which must
be working in order to start the car.

In combination with the computer demanding a certain minimum RPM, there is
the subject of poorly designed oil pressure relief valves from about 85.5
to sometime in 87, for which a retrofit is available.  If your pressure
relief valve is sticking, you may see just enough drag to not meet the
minimum starting RPM.  Also, the computer uses different criteria to start
when warm than when cold.

At this point I don't see enough information to make a better guess.  When
the car is in this "mood", try pulling one of the spark plug wires and
place it near a suitable ground (block, manifold, frame, etc) and see if
it's sparking.  If it isn't, check the flywheel sensors.  If you use an
ohmmeter, check for the resistance between the different pins on each
sensor wire (you don't even have to pull the sensors to do this-- just
disconnect them at the top of the engine).  The two wires are identical, so
if one gives an open circuit between two wires and the other doesn't, then
you have a bad sensor.

Let me know if you need more info.
