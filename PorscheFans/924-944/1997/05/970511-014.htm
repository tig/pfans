In regards to my turnsignal problem on my 80 924 thanks to all who replied.
 This is the one place you can ask a stupid question and get a polite
answer ! This group is the best thing I have found since I bought the car. 
I am very impressed with the information presented and the commitment
members have to maintaining a courtious and respectfull attitude towards
each other.
  My new problem for your discussion,  I have noticed a discrepency with my
door locks.  On the passenger side I can lock and unlock the door with the
lock knob when the door is in either the open or closed position.  I can
not lock the door with the key however, due to the lock mechinism being
diconected from the lock cylinder.  The drivers side however will only lock
when the door is in the closed position.  Is this normal ie: a feature to
keep you from locking the door with your key in the car ? If not normal has
anyone experienced this problem before and is there a fix or must I replace
the mechanism.  
    I also have experienced warm air at my feet with the heater controls
off.  I see that others on the list have had the same problem and am
interested in any replies.  
    My wife drove the car for the first time the other day and was promptly
pulled over by the H.P.  She recieved a equipment violation for a brake
light that worked just fine when she got home.  She thinks he was more
interested in checking out the car then anything else, you know the drill,
slow day, pretty blond, red sports car, I mean Iowa is a great place to
live but it not exactly the excitement capitol of the world!
  Any info any one has to offer will be greatly appreciated.

YOU DON'T GET INTO A PORSCHE...............YOU PUT IT ON!
