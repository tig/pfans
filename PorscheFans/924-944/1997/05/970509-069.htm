Farzaan: 

	The chances that a situration like this happening is pretty slim.  Two
people talking about some what similar rims are the same time.  Since
you made it a point, that it was a misunderstand, so I will apologize
for losing my cool and calling you full of --it.  
	In contrast, you tramline situration still does not make sense. Never
the less, I will leave this battle upto the readers.  Like always, I
will mind my own business until I felt I was trample upon.  Next time we
talk things should be in better terms!!

Regards,

Jason
