Its common when thightening front bearings (conical roller bearings)
that some grease is squeezed out when rotating the hub. Therefore it is
common to 'adjust' them twice when regreased - just like you did. The
check with the thrust washer and the screwdriver is crude and
inaccurate, and alternative methods are often used by experienced
mechanics - but you certainly do that on your own risk.
                 
It's easy to check the bearing play, but you will need an assistant.
Just let someone press hard on the brake. This will effectively lock the
hub to the front spindle, and if the play disappears, then it is located
in the bearing (or in the bolts that hold the disc to the hub or the
caliper to the spindle, but that is very unlikely). If the play then
persists, it can either be felt in the vertical(up) plane, the
vertical(along) plane or (good grief...) both.

If the play is in the vertical plane: 
McPherson strut bushings may be worn, 
bearing in top of strut worn, 
or the lower balljoint worn.
Any combinations possible, ofcourse

If the play is in the horizontal plane:
Steering ball-joint (knuckle) (on any side, 4 of them) 
Steering rack loose or too much play
Front (renewable) A-arm bushing worn
or aft bushing (not 'at-home' renewable) worn
or any combination of above

If it is both ways:
Any of the above, in any combination    

By all means, find the loose part! It may be part of your steering...

Good luck
