I'll try to make this brief and not step on too many toes. 

No start problems can indeed be caused by a bad DME, bad DME relay, bad
reference/speed sensor, or a number of other faults, but one person
responded about an oil pressure relief valve sticking OPEN and causing
too much oil pressure, leading to slow cranking speed.  If the valve
sticks OPEN, there is NO oil pressure, hence no reduction in cranking
speed (but definitely a problem once it does start). 

Yes, leaking oil cooler seals will goo up the oil and get in the passage
of the pressure relief valve, but in my 15 years of repairing 944
engines (and I have seen a lot of stuck open pressure relief valve), I
think some of you guys are barking up the wrong tree.

First, at cranking rpm, the oil pump even with a stuck CLOSED valve will
not put out enough oil pressure to cause the engine not to turn freely. 
Think about this...an extremely COLD engine on a COLD day will put out 5
or more bars of pressure at low rpm, but the engine will start...the oil
pressure is not TOO HIGH to keep the engine from turning fast enough
(Oil viscosity or starter/battery condition might though).

Second, I will let you guys in on a little secret...one that not too
many people really know about.  Too high of FUEL pressure WILL keep a
944 from starting or cause it to die when driving, but not because of
too rich of a mixture caused by too much fuel.  Anyone know why??? 
Let's see who can e-mail me with the correct answer as to WHY!!  Two
free oil filters to the first person who correctly answers this.

You guys that think this oil pressure relief valve problem leads to slow
cranking might check your starter, battery, ground leads, speed and
refernce sensors, etc.  Or, hey maybe I'm wrong.  E-mail me with your
specifics and we will chat about it.
