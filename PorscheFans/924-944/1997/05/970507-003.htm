Hello all:

Hope you can provide some guidance...I have located a 1989 944 in the
following condition:

*  interior in very good condition (no cracked dash)
*  premium sound system (6 speakers w/ equalizer - Blaupunkt)
*  72k miles
*  New clutch
*  New timing belt
*  New valves (timing belt broke last year)
*  New water pump
*  New sunroof motor
*  Inpection revealed some body damage that was well repaired (according
to mechanic)
*  Exhaust, cooling system, transmission in good shape
*  Engine mechanically sound.
*  Evidence that wiring harness was worked on 

The owner will let it go for $8200.  

I know that the body damage and replaced valves are a red flag but the
mechanic says that since they were repaired/replaced, I shouldn't see
any problems.  What I am looking for is a car that I can "restore" and
drive without spending a lot of money to purchase it. I have no problem
investing some money into it. Hope you can advise.  Thanks!
