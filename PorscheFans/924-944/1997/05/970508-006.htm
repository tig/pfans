	It is my understanding that the factory had a 290hp sport option for
the later 250hp cars. I dont know much about it other than it is
expensive ( like you needed to be told that ). I assume that chipping a
951 to something similar may not be too bad. That said I am aware that
chipped cars can suffer from petrol contamination in the oil. This is
where wear starts. I have a 89 951, I am still a million miles and a
large size handfull of God given talent away from driving this car at
its limit. I suffer from the same problem that I guess everyone suffers
from, I want it to go faster, much much faster. But I probably will not
chip my car until my driving is good enough to control what I have, I
have got the suspension set up just right, and I can afford an engine
rebuild. In my mind chipping is a stop gap between stock and a properly
built hi-po motor. If anyone has details of the 290 option let me know
please. I would like a chip that did not increase hp at all, but instead
allowed the driver to spit flames out the exhaust on command ala GT1.

Richard.
