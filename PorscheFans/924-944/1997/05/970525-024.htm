Agreed, but the real issue here is *why* isn't there enough current?

I agree with your cure for the above symptoms and you are undoubtedly a
good mechanic.  But the reasons you've described don't make any sense for
the following reasons (which I briefly double-checked with an electrical
engineer):

1) the injector pulse at idle is measured in milliseconds (10 or so) and
each RPM takes about 100ms.  A magnetic field like the one used in a
solenoid doesn't have a means by which to draw more current-- it has a
fixed resistance and a maximum voltage being applied (12V).  The ground is
connected by the DME and then closed for milliseconds.  If that doesn't
open the injector then it simply doesn't open, period.  The computer has no
way of knowing to leave the connection open longer and even if it did, this
wouldn't give it more amperage.  And even under high pressure, the
injectors do not require that much power to operate.  All this, combined
with the exceptionally short pulse time, makes blaming the *injectors* for
the above described situation inaccurate.  The injectors are only the
manifestation of the problem (a bad regulator).

2) you state that the *injectors* are causing the largest part of the
electrical drain (drawing milliamps) yet the fuel pump and starter are
capable of pulling multiple *amps*.  While the injectors use extremely
short pulses, the electric fuel pump and the starter are essentially open
circuits with relatively no pulsations.

3) The DME only provides a *ground* for the injectors-- they are wired from
the positive terminal of the battery through their own system, not through
the DME. By disconnecting one of the injectors, you don't reduce the load
on the DME, as you stated, but on the entire electrical system.  The DME
doesn't supply the current-- the battery does that-- just the ground.  The
computer isn't "shutting down" the injectors-- there just isn't enough
power left to open them.  The computer shuts down the injectors if it
senses that the engine is stopped (or below a min crank speed).

What's more likely happening?

While starting a vehicle you have two high-current devices: starter and
fuel pump.  In effect, these two items get all the power they can handle--
what's left over goes to the DME and other electrical.  It's like trying to
divy up a dollar bill with a prioritized list.  And under normal
conditions, the battery has more than enough power for everything.  If the
battery is weak, you don't have enough to go around.  If the starter or
fuel pump want more current, they get it.  If there isn't enough left over
to open two injectors at once, that's the way it goes.  When you unplug one
of the injectors, you aren't freeing very much power, but then again, it
doesn't take much to open the injectors.  We are really discussing a
borderline situation.  Plug a battery charger/booster into the system and
you would likely have enough power to start the car even with extremely
high fuel pressure (assuming you don't blow something).

>Many, many people have purchased fuel pumps, DME's, you name it because

The problem is indeed electrical (not enough power to run the pump at
beyond design pressure), but it is caused by a mechanical part failure.

While I respect your talent and experience, I do not agree with your
analysis and it is somewhat demeaning to the rest of us when you come into
the group touting your experience and offering prizes for misleading
information.  Please be more careful with your information as the rest of
us do not have the experience which you possess onto which we can fall
back.  This is not meant to be an attack, so please excuse me if it comes
off that way.  I'm only interested in getting to the cold, hard facts in
this situation.  If I'm mistaken in my analysis, someone please tell me-- I
greatly appreciate it when someone helps me get things straight.
