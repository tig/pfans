Hey dudes,

Had a good weekend this past one.  I didn't particularly do well, but I had a 
hoot and Paul did well.

On Saturday, we headed out to the big racetrack, Mission Raceway Park for a Solo I
type of event.  We didn't use the normal methods of Solo I though.  We did a
standing start from the hot pits, then did about 90% of the track and had a stop
box down the straight at the end of the lap.  Kind of like a high-speed auto-x.

Both Paul and I are running street tires, almost everyone else was running
race tires.  I was the first car out.  I ran a 64.1.  This time was pretty
good because they had put a chicane down the back straight to slow cars down.
Fortunately, the organizers were watching me go through this section and
realized how dangerous that chicane really was.  It through you off line
and into a wild yawing motion.  After my run, they took that chicane out.
Next up was Paul with a 58.9.  Next run up the timers were not working.
In the later set of runs, Paul ran a 58.8 or somewhere around there and I
ran two runs at 59.7 back to back.  There was nothing more left.  I pushed
and pushed, but my SP8000's just couldn't keep up with Paul's S-02's.  The
top four times out of the 22 cars that showed up were as follows.  Note the
tires used:

Driver			Car		Tire				Time
Paul Buchmann		1989 944T	Potenza S-02 Street		58.8
Glen Rodgerson	198? Mustang	BFG R1 Race			59.4
Farzaan Kassam	1989 944T	Dunlop SP8000 Street	59.7
Kevin Packer		198? CRX	BFG R1 Race (full racecar)	59.8

Everyone else after, regardless of streer or race rubber was 60.0 or
slower.  I thought these cars were pretty amazing at the auto-x, well,
they are extremely amazing at the track.  Total over achievers in every
way.  Everyone else was braking at the #4 marker coming down from about
150-160km/h.  Paul and I both were on the binders at the #2 marker from
165-170km/h.  Through the corners, we were both doing big drifts and small
tail slides in perfect control (excpet for Paul's last run where we missed
his braking point and took the escape road!).  What a blast.  When pulled
into the pits, the car was cold as a cucumber, no wierd smells.  They
didn't even look like we pushed them so hard.  The car just sat there
waiting for its next run.  Quite a bit different than my Talon which
would have been overheating at this point or at least raising the
earth's temperature a few degrees from the heat that engine used to
radiate!

On Sunday, we headed out to Regional #2 of the CACC series up in Whistler.
This event has been a problem for me for the last 3 years.  The course
is very bumpy and you have to downshift to first, something I hate doing.
My first year there, I was 10 seconds back from the 1st place guy, Paul
was 12 seconds back (in our Talons).  My second year I withdrew from sunstroke
and my last year there, I DNF'ed all three runs.  This year, I was
determined to do better.  First run out, I click of a 49.8 + 2 cones.
This was a really good time, right off the bat.  Paul clicked off a 51.5 +
2 cones.  He was not downshifting, I was.  His next run, he downshifted and
everything worked out, he ran a 48.6 clean.  That run would eventually give
him second place in A/S Pax.  My second run was a very good 49.2, but I
punted a stupid cone, one that I didn't even have to come near!  It was
third run time now, Paul already had his fast run that he needed so he went
psycho his third run.  He ran a 48.1 but planted three cones across the
track :)  I had to make a decision, run hard and get a low 49 second time,
but risk walking away with a 51 second total time if I wack another cone
or take it easy and get a time better than 51.2 (which is what I had 49.2 +
2 seconds = 51.2).  I took it pretty easy around the area where I hit the
cone, but then I did some stupid things, I tried to make up time where it
couldn't be made up and made a few mistakes.  My time was a 50.6 clean.
Oh well, it was still better than 51.2, and I was on street rubber too.

Wes in his S2 was having a similar day to mine, good scratch times, but cones.
I think he put in a clean slow run on his second run just to get a time too,
something like a 49.7 on race rubber.  We did fun runs after.  Paul went out
and looped his car.  I went out and ran a 49.5 clean (wish I could have done
that in my timed runs!)  I think Wes improved on his fun run too, but still
had cones.  The course was very, very tight.

I guess the worst part of the day was the realization that I came in
DFL (dead freaking last) in my class.  Our points are determined off the
fastest time of the class, so positions don't matter.  My time wasn't
that far off the regular competitors so I wasn't too upset (I'm still
in the running), but coming in last, ack.  Everyone in the class just
eeked me out of positions.  The three guys ahead of me were like 50.5,
50.1 and 49.9.  The first place person in my class was a 911TT which ran a
47.1.  Of the regulars, Tim Stark took 2nd in his R1 shod 944T with a 49.4.
I am gonna kick these guys' butts when I get my Hoosiers back! :)

Paul had a good position as mentioned above with a 2nd in Pax!  One thing is
for sure, those S-02s may feel mushy and may squeal more, but they do work
better than the SP8000s.  Paul and I usually run without a couple of tenths
when we are both on race rubber, but with the street tires, he's getting
me by over 1/2 a second on most events and sometimes 1 second.  The TT is
also running on his street S-02s.

One last thing, if you have not driven the Sea to Sky Highway from Vancouver
to Whistler in your life at this time of year, you are missing out on some
of the most beautiful, challenging, safe, twisty mountain roads this world
has to offer.  You come over a rise at a good rate of speed and have a downhill
right hander all cambered and the pressure against your left body side loads
up, you feel the g forces, come over another rise and right there is a gorgeous
snow covered mountain with beautiful green grass and trees all around you.
The echo from the exhaust is just wild when you are WOT next to a mountain
side.  We had Tim Stark, myself and then Paul all charging up to the event
in our 944T's.  It was fun :)

Farzaan.
