Gary, I just bought an oil filter for my 944S2 from the dealership for
$5.40.  He gave a PCA discount, so be sure to mention that.  Another example
I found was that the timing belt for my car was $27 at the dealer vs. $33
via mail order.

BTW, I agree with Anders Svensson when he says that some filters do not have
the non return flap that keeps oil in the filter at rest.  I've heard of
stories where these filters can release trapped particles back into the oil.  

>>I would like to mail order half dozen oil filters.  Automotion sells
>>them for about $9 each plus shipping.  Does anyone know of other
>>discount sources?  Is this the best price around?
