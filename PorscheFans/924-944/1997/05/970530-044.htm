All,

I want to rearrange my intake.  My plan is to modify the airflow meter to
turbo boot, so that the airflow meter points towards the headlight (like the
mass flow sensor).  I have a massive cone filter, and I think I can get it
all wedged in there.  I might take out the headlight.

Also, once the area behind the intercooler is empty, I want to put in new
piping from turbo to intercooler and intercooler to throttle.  It seems that
straightening out and slightly increasing the diameter of these tubes should
free it up substantially.

The part I'm not sure about is where to install the banjo bolt that's on the
turbo to intercooler pipe.  In a past issue of Excellence, they did an
article called Vision Racer (the one with the KILLER fabcar wing).  If your
familiar w/ this article, they have a nice picture of the engine compartment
(that's what gave me the idea).  They put the banjo bolt on the intercooler
to throttle pipe.  I guess all that would do is give you a tad more boost (it
would be telling the computer the pressure after the intercooler instead of
before it).

Does anyone have any ideas what problems I may be getting into or what the
effects of this might be?  I'm sure I'ld be better off just getting a mass
flow meter, but I don't have $1700 to drop on one of those babys!

Any help or comments are greatly appreciated.
