OK! OK! Thanks for the input.

Menelaos -- Relax! I didn't take it as a flame. I've read all of Pasha's
stuff, and have had advice from several track instructors about the hazards
of lowering a 944, and I know the sources for control arms.  I was
considering a mild 1/2 to 1 inch height reduction, or whatever you end up
w/ when you get stiffer springs.  The amount of lowering seems to vary with
the model, individual car and spring manufacturer. One 944S driver I know
didn't see any lowering (for some reason) when he should have had an inch.
I don't want a cripple that can't handle speed bumps, etc. I just want a
little less lean and a little less of that feeling of bouncing sidewise on
the outer edges of the outside tires in high-speed corners. It makes me
nervous. It would be nice to flatten the attitude and get some of that
weight on the inside tires. I'm tired of rotating wheels all the time.

I should have mentioned I'm running R1s, and the tires are outcornering my
suspension.  I know 944s don't roll over (right?), but sometimes it feels
real close.  Even stock 944s can feel like Buick rentals in high-speed
corners.

A stock 951 next to me at the last event was a good inch lower than my
relatively stock S2. Does a stock '87 951 have steel control arms? Or a
different suspension geometry?

My main concern is that once you change the front, then you have to change
the rear, and torsion bar rates go up and the rear bar has to be stiffer
and the shocks on full stiff, and soon you've got a car that's not much fun
on long trips.

My initial question was has anyone seen decreases in lap timesthat they can
attribute to lowering, not the problems that attend lowering.

It was an innocent question. Honest.
