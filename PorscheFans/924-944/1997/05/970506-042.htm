Hi all,

After having my mechanic perform some normal maintenance on my car last 
week, I found out I have a cracked header pipe (for cylinder #2). When 
examining the pipe, a small amount of exhaust dust can be seen coming out 
 from underneath the heat shield. The car is a '86 951 and I have the new, 
updated "accordion" style of exhaust. I have been told this is a pretty 
common problem. After realizing a new set of header pipes are around $800 
(and you might as well change both while the mechanic is in there = $1600), 
I deceived to think about it. I believe a used set could be found for around 
$400 a piece.

My question to the ones of you who might have experienced this before:
Is this a critical problem? I know you haven't seen or heard the car, but 
let me try to explain a bit more. The crack is minute and you can only see a 
small trace of dust. The sound is completely stock, no "bludder". As far as 
I can see, the only problem would be a small increase in turbo lag. My 
mechanic is definitely a perfectionist (which is good!), and said that down 
the road you could get different heat factors in the exhaust and therefore 
decrease the efficiency of the turbo. BTW, the shop is also heavily involved 
in racing, which I believe would be a different story. Anybody out there 
have any experience of this type of exhaust failure?
 From my rather limited experience, I see no problem driving the car until 
the header cracks more and start to make the "bludder" sound.

Carl
