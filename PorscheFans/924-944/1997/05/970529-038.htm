All,

I posted recently regarding intermittent stalling/not starting due to
suspected wiring harness to DME problems.  I finally bailed out on it and
turned it over to my mechanic and said "fix it".  He replaced half of the
female connectors in the harness, and had to order some more.  I did take the
car over the weekend (w/ half the connectors replaced).  I put about 700
miles on it.  It only stalled 3 times.  The first two were about 20 min.
apart.  I was on the Interstate coming out of atlanta.  It stalled, I told my
buddy riding shotgun to kick the floorboard, and it picked right back up.  It
did this once more about 20 min later, picked right back up.  The third time
was the next evening, about 300 miles later.  I didn't have anyone riding
shotgun, and could barely reach the floorboard (try it while buckeled in
going down the interstate!).  I pulled over, and it had picked back up as I
was pulling over, because when I put the clutch in, it didn't stall.  Those
were the only stalls.  He finished replacing the rest of the connectors, and
I picked it up today.  Hasn't stalled yet.  Total cost was about $270.  I
hope it's over!  I'll let you all know in a couple of weeks if fixed, or as
soon as it stalls again!
