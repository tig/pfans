Jim,

I would take the Yokos hands down.   I have a set on my 86 951 (stock
size)--there's simply nothing wrong with them.  The comparable Dunlop would
be the SP-8000.  Both the D40 and SP-8000 are directional, while the AVSi
is asymmetrical, FWIW.  The D-40 is down a notch or two from the AVSi.
Scuttlebutt is that they are not as well made and some experience problems
with being out of round.  Rumors, maybe, but I've heard nothing but raves
about the Yokohamas.  I had a set of D40s on a Saab turbo which my Dad now
drives.  It's an OK tire, but the Yokohamas are so much better made.  I
just ordered a set for my Alfa 164.
