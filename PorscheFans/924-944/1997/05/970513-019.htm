Jim,

I don't know enough about the 944 S2 cabriolet to give you technical advice,
but I can give you my .02 cents worth on other things . . .

Porsche AG (the manufacturer) is offering a 12 month UNLIMITED MILEAGE warranty
on certain models that are at least 7 or 8 model years old or NEWER, so a 
1991 car would certainly qualify.  The car has to pass a 120 point inspection
by the dealer in order to qualify and also be below a certain mileage 
(90,000 miles, I think).  This is the same deal as the Lexus Certified Pre-
Owned cars or Mercedes-Benz Certified Pre-Owned cars ads you see on TV.  The
one great thing Porsche does that no one else does is that they offer an
UNLIMITED MILEAGE warranty for 12 months - a truly great testament to their
belief in the longetivity and durability of these remarkable machines.

INSIST that the dealer put the car through this 120 point inspection and give
you the 12 month/unlimited mileage warranty AT NO EXTRA CHARGE TO YOU.  They
are supposed to do this anyway (so long as they are a factory authorized
Porsche dealership).  This will also give you peace of mind after your purchase
because they are supposed to correct ANY problems they encounter prior to your
purchase.

Call 1-800-PORSCHE and ask them to give the telephone number for the Porsche
Customer Committment Group (sorry, but I don't have that # handy at work).
Call the PCCG and ask them about the pre-owned warranty.  They can give you
the exact details as well as send you a written brochure explaining it
further.

IMHO $26,500.00 is way too much for this car - something like what you are
offering in the low 20's seems much more reasonable.  I would definitely
deduct more if they cannot provide the complete service history on the car.

I bought a 1989 911 carrera coupe back in 1995 and paid around $26,000.00 for
it (72,000 miles).  This car has a totally different feel to it than the
944 series.  IMHO the 911 requires more skill in cornering/shifting than the
944 because the 944 is a much better balanced car for handling.  The 944 has
a less harsher ride IMHO, and shifts easier because of the different synchros
Porsche used in them.  I have a totally stock/unchipped 1986 944 turbo and I
can say as a matter of fact that it is a much quicker car than the totally 
stock 1989 911 I owned (but then again, I didn't own the 911 for very long so
consequently I didn't get totally proficient at 0-60 mph accelerations).

Both cars are high maintenance items.  Both will have problems, but the problems
are of a different nature.  With the 944, you have water related problems
(leaky hoses, radiator, etc.) whereas with the 911 you have no water problems
since it's air cooled, but you do have the major expense of manual valve
adjustments every 15,000 miles (can run $1,200.00 or more at a dealership).

The one good thing is that the 944 you are considering comes with a warranty.
If this is your first Porsche (hopefully the first of many) then IMHO go for
the 944 S2 with the warranty and drive the hell out of it for 12 months to
give you an idea of what the maintenance is going to be like.

The reason I sold my 911 and bought my 944 turbo is because I was told that
the 944 is a cheaper car to maintain.  Well I personally don't believe that's
true.  It is just as expensive as the 911, but just has a different set of
problems to deal with, IMHO.

I've had my car for a little over a year now and have spent at least $6,000.00
on maintenance.  Some of the stuff I've had done was not required, but I am
extremely picky about my car and insist on fixing anything as soon as it
breaks - I don't let things sit so they can get worse.  Just to give you an
idea, this is what I've had done (remember my car is a 1986 944 turbo):

 1. replaced the clutch
 2. replaced both engine mounts
 3. replaced CV joints/half shafts
 4. replaced radiator fan switch
 5. replaced turbo cooler sensor switch (? - don't remember the exact name)
 6. replaced front hood shocks
 7. replaced A/C switch on dash
 8. replaced entire switch device on steering column (turn signal, wiper
                                                      control, headlight flash,
                                                      etc.)
 9. replaced all belts (part of regular maintenance)
10. replaced slightly leaking winshield washer reservoir
11. replaced various leaking hoses within the coolant system and power
    steering system
12. replaced clutch master cylinder
13. replaced power door lock switch on center console
14. replaced O-ring seals around transaxle oil cooler (I think this is specific
                                                       only to 944 turbos, but
                                                       I'm not sure though)

All of the above was done at the dealership where I purchased my car from, and
I'm sure that because it was the dealership, I paid a premium price for the
services performed.  But, my dealership stands behind their work and what
they sell - they always give me a loaner car (once a NA 944, another time a
BMW 325is).  Unfortunately for me, my car was too old to qualify for the pre-
owned warranty.  If you are mechanically inclined, have some good tools, and
most importantly HAVE THE TIME, much of what I had done to my car could be done
at home.  For me, lack of time has always been a problem, until now.

That's just my .02 cents worth and my humble opinions.  Take it for what they're
worth.

Good luck with your decision.

Naweed
'86 951
