Well, you're still a little off base.  First off the compressor turns a 
low pressure gas into a high pressure gas (not gas into liquid!).  It is 
the condensor coil (the one in front of the radiator) that turns the high 
pressure gas into a liquid.  You are correct though that when that liquid 
reaches the evaporator is again turns into a gas as it "expands".  The 
refrigerant is metered into the evaporator coil and expands (returns to 
gas) as it travels through the evaporator.

Secondly, the receiver-drier does two things.  One is to remove any
moisture in the refrigerant so that as the refrigerant reaches this
evaporator metering point it doesn't freeze (since evaporator temperatures
can reach below 30) on the expansion device and restrict the refrigerant
flow.  Secondly, any refrigerant that might reach the compressor as liquid
is expanded back into a gas in the r-d before the liquid reaches the
compressor.  Pouring liquid refrigerant into your a/c compressor is like
pouring water into your cylinders instead of air and fuel.  It does this
by having the "in" tube into the r-d so that it empties into the r-d lower
than the pick-up point.  The "outlet" (or to the compressor) is mounted up
high so it won't suck liquid into the compressor and usually extends to
the bottom as well with a "metered" hole in the tube at the bottom to
allow any residual oil accumulation to return to the compressor.  Yes, a
small amount of refrigerant gets through this hole when no oil is present,
but like I said it is metered and designed so the refrigerant that gets
past would expand into a gas before it gets to the compressor.  That's why
it is important to get the r-d connected right. 

Hope this clears up some of the mis-information floating around about a/c 
systems.
