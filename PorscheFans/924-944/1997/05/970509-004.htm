Just an update on the chirpping noise in the front end of my car when
turning left.  I have the car at Porsche Place in Marietta, GA this morning
having the A/C repaired.  I mentioned the squeeking problem and asked him
to look at it while the car was there.  He called with the estimate on the
A/C (ouch - $785) also letting me know the front wheel bearings were loose.
 Since it was there and its only $28 to have them repacked and setup I'm
having it done.  

BTW - A/C - $479 new condensor $150 Labor $155 Freon 
He said someone had put an el cheapo condensor in the car not long ago
