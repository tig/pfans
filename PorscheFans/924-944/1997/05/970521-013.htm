Hi Porschefans,

I just read a few messages about the Porsche museum=20
and got a few mail-questions for contact information. So I think
it could be a good idea to publish some information about
german museum....???

It is a nice idea to combine the following three places in
a small trip from Stuttgart to Frankfurt or vice versa...
(Stuttgart/Frankfurt distance is about 200 km (~140 mls) )

1.) STUTTGART

If anybody comes to Germany and wants to visit Porsche,=20
he should combine it with a tour through the factory. The=20
museum is VERY small and the porsche guys could only show a
few cars out of their huge collection. (They do have at=20
least two 924 : The Ex-R=F6hrl 924 GTS/R and the 924 GTP
LeMans Prototype with the 944 turbo engine).  The sequence
of the shown cars is somehow random.
But the place is really worth a visit, cause you can smell=20
the history of that place and it's always nice to see
the cars dropping out of the factory - I could watch that for hours....
The contact for the museum and the factory tours is:

Porsche Automobilmuseum=20
Stuttgart H=E4rmle
Porschestr. 42
Postfach 400640
70435 Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen

Tel. +49 711 / 8 27-56 85
Fax +49 711 / 8 27-51 11=20

2.) SINSHEIM

On the way to Frankfurt you should make a stop at=20
Sinsheim (half the way). The museum is located directly at the=20
autobahn and shows a nice collection of famous cars. Beside
the car show you can also see other technical collections
like planes, submarines, trains and other stuff - all in 1:1 scale !
A VERY big museum with a lot of Porsches:

Auto + Technik Museum Sinsheim
Obere Au 2
74889 Sinsheim

Tel. +49 7261 / 6 11 16 or /9 29 90
Fax +49 7261 / 1 39 16=20

3.) FRANKFURT

If anybody is in Germany and interested in Porsche
and also wants to see some other sportcars, the
following museum is a real must. Not far away from=20
Stuttgart at Frankfurt this museum is worth a trip
around the planet. One of the biggest sportcar selection
worldwide (more than 200 of the best cars ever built).
They are very proud that every car is ready to drive.
You can see more Porsche than in Stuttgart and the chances
are high to see a lot of lent cars out of the Porsche factory=20
collection. The real place - highly recommended !
