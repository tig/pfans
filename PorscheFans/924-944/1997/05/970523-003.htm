Daniel,
      Here is what I did:
o Fill the reservoir
o turn P/S pump by hand (belt removed) until you feel pressure built up,
re-fill reservoir if necessary
o re-connect belt
o start car and shut off
o repeat start car and shut off a couple more times
o Before you drive it for the first time, make sure you turn the wheel
back and forth while the engine is running.
o make sure you keep the reservoir topped off

  While you have the reservoir off, you might want to trim the seams off
the nipples (The resevoir is cast).  I believe this is the cause of most
leaks. I also had a leak from the reservoir cap since it didn't have a
gasket of any sort. I made one..

If anyone else has better instructions, let us know..
Good Luck,
         Ezra
