Well, the subject line decribes the work I "got done" on Sunday afternoon...

I have some (more) questions re: timing belt tension... I'm really close,
so bear with me, please...

after fiddling with the timing belt more than I care to recount, I am still
terribly unsure how to set the correct tension...

+ + + Here's what I'm doing:

1. I set the engine to TDC at the flywheel, check the cam notches, then
back it up 1 to 1.5 cam sprocket teeth... (thanks for those who replied on
this)

2. I got the timing belt around the crankshaft pulley fine (thanks for
those who replied on this) and then put the auto-tensioner back on... so
far so good...

3. I move the tensioner arm all the way down, making sure the timing belt
is seated in teeth on the crankshaft pulley, I pull it up the long side and
wrap it around the camshaft sprocket and then down around the water pump
pulley and then around the auto tensioner sprocket

4. I slowly release the tensioner arm... measure the tension...

5. If the tension seems evenly distributed and close to spec, I rotate the
engine clockwise one turn, and check again...

+ + + Here's what has me walking around the front yard like an uncaged animal:

1. I can't always get even tension on the belt... (backing it up 1 to 1.5
cam sprocket teeth before placing the belts seems to help in this regard)

2. When I do get even tension, who knows what the tension is? I have the
expensive tensioner gauge, but for two things:

a. to get a read on the belt, I have to slide the tool between the belt and
that rear plastic cover- this adds a slight amount of tension to the belt,
skewing my measurement- for obvious reasons, I can't remove the rear
cover... my inclination is to just allow a "slight overread" on the gauge,
but I assume since I have a $400 gauge to measure this thing, accuracy is
of some importance...

b. I can get any measurement I want by tapping the crank to or fro... I
know this is incorrect, but this just shows me how frail whatever
measurement I get actually is...

3. My auto-tensioner seems very close to correct as is, maybe just a wee
little too tight if anything... it's a 1987 part, can I trust it? The
auto-tensioner was fully released on the old belt, if it seems just a
little too tight, should I bolt the tensioner down before the fully relesed
point? Will this re-distribute the slackness? The tension on the long side
seems like a crap shoot.

+ + + What's with the tension anyhow?

1. the belt has teeth, so it seems that the tightness is primarily to keep
the belt from slipping teeth? right or wrong? Too tight would break it, too
loose would slip... seems like there would be some amount of margin here...

2. If 1. above is true, than is close enough enough? I can get close
tension, I can't get dead on, yeah that's the tension, go with it, no
worries style tension...

+ + +

In advance, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...

I'm so close to finished... I long to drive my car again... sniff, sniff...

+ + +

BTW the "special tool" (long handle with a round piece on the end with two
pins sticking out) used for holding the balance shaft sprockets while you
tighten the locknut * ALSO * fits in those two little holes on the arm of
the auto tensioner so you can pivot the tensioner arm pretty easily- I
can't describe how awesome this "feature" is... if you are to ever do
balance shafts and/or belt tensioning (after 1987 models), this is the best
$45 I've spent so far...
