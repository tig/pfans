Thanks Ben.  I have a great deal of respect for the men in blue also, in all
countries.  But there is just a big difference in respect out of admiration
and respect out of fear/initmidation.  Case in point, the other weekend I was
on a road trip and I stopped on the side of a road to ask a state trooper for
directions.  I don't know what this guy's problem was but I tell you I have
never had another human being give me the absolute dirty look full of
hatred that this guy gave me.  He was not only rude, but he would not even
speak to me, and I had asked him very politely for directions.  He just pointed
to the road I was already on and stared at me, waiting for me to drive off.
Turns out also the direction he pointed was opposite to where I needed to go.
Thanks for nuthin' smokey!  Bet he got a good laugh out of that.  But anyway,
I think most of the men in blue are good people like you and I, but I just
seem to always run into the ones with bad attitudes.  I must have a sign on me
or something asking for it.  Seriously though, I have tried to strike up
casual conversations with peace officers in this country and find they are
very unresponsive to me.  It's kind of hard to have a conversation when the
other party isn't interested.  And on the other hand, when I was visiting
London several years ago, I just walked up to a 'bob' (I think that's what
the COPs in UK are still called) and we had a nice little chat.  Go figure.

Naweed.
