Hi Tracy;

The Hoosiers are a lot lighter than the BFG's. They are also about 2 seconds
a lap faster in a race, when driven hard. The down side is:
1. They wear a LOT faster. I can get mabye 3 race weekends out of them if i
am lucky, and even then they are well past there fastest by the third
weekend. I usually have on set to practice on, and on set to qualify and
race. The next weekend(depending on my competition) i would take the
previous weeks race set and practice on them, using new rubber for the qual
and race.

For dirvers-ed the BFG's or the Toyo's are a whole lot more cost effective.

2. They can corner harder, but they are much less forgiving. You can still
feel the "edge" before they ley go, but it is more subtle and a lot shorter
window.

3. The flat spot very easily under braking. If you lock them up rally badly
you will burn them down to the cord.

If I read your message right, you were driving to an event on the Hoosiers.
remember, they are a RACE tire, not a modified street tire like the BFG's.
They are very slick in the wet, they have a very thin layer of rubber on the
bottom (hence the fast "wear out" rate), and they will not take well to
street driving. If it is more tham a 10-15 min trip to the event, don't even
bother because you will in all liklyhood tear them up.

I know you don't want to hear that, but they are a great race tire, with all
the inherant drawback that represents. the BFG's and toyo's are much more
"dual prupose". I would try to get them to the event somehow, and put them
on the car once you are there.

Good luck.
