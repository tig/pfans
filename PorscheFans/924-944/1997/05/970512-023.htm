Hi Tom/Scott:

In response to your latest query on my 17" OZ Racing, Fittipaldi
Stars.

Yes, I've noted the "tramlining" posts.  I agree with those who call
for civility.  On the other hand, blanket statements can cause
difficulties and misunderstanding.  As Farzaan discovered in his
private postings with "jplee" those wheels were custom-built.  My
wheels are also NOT "off-the-shelf", they were built up by the
distributor (Fittipaldi Motoring Accessories, in Florida and they
were aware of the car it was going on).  

The front wheels are definitely 9" wide between the rims because an
extra 1/2" wider outside rim was used on a normally 8 1/2" wheel
center.  In fact, you'll see the hub stamped 8 1/2", however, you can
verify the 9" width by tape-measure.  Hopefully you'll have received
my photographs and so can see that 9" front wheels do fit on a 951
(with BFG Comp TA R1s at least).

I have experienced tram-lining, of a mild sort, with these wheels on
occasion, as when going back to the motel from a track event.  I've
driven hundreds of such miles by now, and IMHO don't see it as a
problem.  In fact, there are parts of the Interstate I drive where
even stock wheels will tram-line due to the truck ruts pounded into
the pavement.  So, to me it seems pretty relative and depends on your
preferences, better cornering/braking versus occasional self-steering
in the straight line. I think you are right it depends on the tires,
the road,  and the basic alignment of the vehicle. 

Anyhow, these have been wonderful rims for me, I wish I had a Porsche
to put them on, and I'd go racing!  Love to give you a good deal on
them!  Let me know.

Best regards,
