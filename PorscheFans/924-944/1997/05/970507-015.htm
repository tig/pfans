<<As a newcomer to USA, I recently put out a request for recommendations
of good Porsche garages on Long Island NY.  Defying all stereotypes of
New Yorkers ;-) I had nothing but speedy and helpful responses.  In
summary, the following were all recommended:

Bill Rohr, Rohr Performance Development, Bayshore
"The Owner", Formula Motorsports, Long Island City
Kevin Murphy, Porsche Spoken Here, West Babylon
Ken Raab, German Auto Repair Technicians,  Amityville>>

--------------------------------------------------------------------

"The owner" of Formula Motorsports is Mark Tashjian (718-482-0515).

If you are AT ALL interested in drivers ed, autcrossing, etc., he is
undoubtably THE GUY.

If you are not, he is still THE GUY. He has a mad Austrian bodyman who
is absolutely the best. He has one 'assistant' who helps. He does
everything else himself. You can even take your new P-Car to him for
routine maintenance because his work does not void the Porsche Warranty.

Do not expect a lotta schmooze in a spotlessly clean, totally safe
environment. Long Island City is NOT the garden spot of Long Island, but
it is incredibly close to Manhattan with easy subway access. Think race
car prep shop. Think race and street engine builder. Think past PCA
President for Metro NY. Think 30 years experience with an engineering
degree. Think of an individual who frequently fills in as a driver for
IMSA teams and campaigns the fastest Porsche in PCA racing.

This guy KNOWS Porsches AND he has reasonable prices.

Tell him I sent you.

Paul Foster
