> Steve,
>       When I bought my '86 944 last fall, it had 225 50 15'2 on it. I
> have replaced the front set, and stuck with the same size. The drawbacks
> to using this size tire:
> o They are not a common size, so will usually have to be special order
> o Your Speedometer will read high, and your milage will accumulate

> probably will not get to it for several months still.)
> o Will track on uneven roads more than stock
> 
> Benefits are:
> o Looks better
> o Better low end acceleration
> o Better handling due to lower profile and larger width

> If you can live with the above, go for it!

With the "auto-tension" (mechanical belt-tensioner) do not turn the
engine back 1 to 1.5 teeth marks from T.D.C.  There is no need to do
that.  Also, there is no need to measure the tension with your gauge
when using the mechanical tensioner (assuming no one has disassembled it
and changed the spring setting).
