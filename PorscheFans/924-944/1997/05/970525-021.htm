Police radar is a very low-priority in the  band-sharing allocation.  
If you happen to be transmitting legally in an area where radar 
happens to be and it "accidentally"  causes the radar to read 
incorrectly, you will not be in any way liable. A friend of mine set 
up an automated rain/weather monitoring station in an area where a  
police radar trap was operating (deliberately).  The police radar 
operators stopped making money, took him to court, and lost.  I am 
for anything that keeps the police from making money off of us, and 
anything I can do that does not compromise public safety I will do 
within the law if possible and practical.  Police radar traps, speed 
traps, police with attitude really, really torque me off.  You know 
as well as I do that there are some areas of the bands that police 
radar and our transmitters operate on on a shared allocation, and WE 
have the priority.   You know very well that we have cars that can 
operate well above the legal limit which is enforced in many states 
only as a money maker for the local yokel sheriff and expletive 
deleted city revenue collectors/politicians.  The PD can get stuffed 
as far as I'm concerned.  As long as you say it isn't worth the 
fight, the goon squads have free reign.
