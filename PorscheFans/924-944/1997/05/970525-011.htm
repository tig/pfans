P-fans:

My wife had been admiring my 968 coupe for some time, so on Friday I bought
her a 92 968 cabriolet (with 3000 miles!) from a local exoticar dealer.  The
car is gorgeous, in real showroom condition.  We both love it, although the
tiptronic makes in nicer for her but a little less interesting for me, which
is fine.

2 questions:

1.  I would like to wire her radar detector directly into a switched power
wire (with an added fuse, of course).  I want to disrupt the factory wiring
as little as possible.  Is there a particular wire to go for which would be
nearest the passenger visor or that side of the dash?

2.  I bought a bra for the car from a Porsche dealer.  It is made by Colgan
with the Porsche insignia.  The car has no stone chips, so I thought now was
the time to do this.  Unfortunately, the hood will not close with the hood
portion attached.  The parts guy thinks the hood striker or the latch might
have to be adjusted to allow hood closure.  Has any of you run into this
problem?

Thanks!
