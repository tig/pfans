Union 76 has 100 octane unleaded racing fuel.  The motor octane is listed=

at 106 and the research octane at 94.  My understanding is that they have=

to average the two figures and come up with 100.  I'm not clear on this b=

I think the 106 motor octane is what the actual burn rate in your engine
is. =


Anyhow,  I bought a 55 gallon drum at a cost of $4.50/gal.  Not cheap, bu=

Union 76 is the fuel NASCAR runs in their high dollar iron.  Our local
witch's brew 100 unleaded costs $3.99/gallon so I went with the top dog. =

There was no detonation with it running in my turbo and a noticeable powe=

difference when running it in the S2.  I had a drum pump left over from m=

motorcycle racing days so fill ups are no problem.  You can buy a pump fo=
r
$30 and up. =


=46rom what I can tell, the majority of the blown headgaskets are from
detonation or maybe a combination of detonation and high boost.  The
conventional wisdom is to run race fuel at the track and a 50% mixture on=

the street if you drive like most of us.  To each his own, but I am
personally sick and tired of seeing the tops of my pistons so I'll stick
with the race fuel.
