You didn't strike a nerve or chord in a bad way.  The info you're giving is
good for the list.  My figures above are peak.  Are you taking an average
boost or waiting for it to level off or anything like that?  My boost
pressure is only 16-18 for the range between around 3500-5000rpm.  After
that area, it starts to nosedive to 14-14.5 and around 6500rpm, it goes down
to 13.0-13.5.  My rev limiter is 6800rpm, whereas the APE chips seem to be
7200rpm or so.  I think stock is 6400rpm???

The cylindrical part is the cycling valve.  While I have not taken mine
apart to inspect it, I will assume it works similar to all other turbo
production cars in that all it does is bleed pressure off the line going to
the wastegate to make it open later thus giving higher boost than would
be made with the factory wastegate spring alone (which is quite soft to
open at 0.2bar only).

I don't think any of the turbo books out there are very good.  I've got about
three of them and haven't seen any of the really new, trick stuff in
there.  A better resource are the archives of the Talon list which is one of
the most technical (turbo wise) mailing lists around.  It's also moderated
so there is much less junk than most lists (this list is not moderated per se
and has managed a high quality level of posts somehow, this is rare).  If 
you go to http://www.dsm.org and click on "search the archives" you can then
enter topics that you are interested in like CBV or wastegate, etc, and it
will look them up for you.  Posts from people like Dave Buschur, Eric Typpo,
Brian Hood, Fred Miranda, John Archer, and me [ :) ] are the ones really worth
reading.

These are the areas that would affect boost:
1. Cycling valve is not bleeding enough pressure so wastegate is seeing more
   pressure and opening at 0.8 bar.
2. The compressor bypass valve is leaking.  Your turbo is creating the 1.0bar,
   but the CBV is allowing it to leak back into the non-pressurized side of
   the turbo.  You can easily check this.  The CBV is the black cylinder next
   to the coolant bottle.  Take off the vacuum hoses and the intake hoses and
   see if you can see through it or blow through it.  It should be shut and not
   allow any air through.  Powerhaus said they fail every 40k and often need
   replacement.  My aftermarket unit will be arriving soon.  We were supposed
   to use the Talon one I got, but we used that on the hillclimb race car so
   Buschur Racing is sending me another one to test out.  My car will sound like
   a 962 when shifting gears.
3. The exhaust header is cracked and allowing exhaust energy to escape.
4. The wastegate is cracked and not making an effective seal.  Does the car feel
   laggy, really laggy?
5. There is an intake leak somewhere, perhaps a loose pipe.  Any wooshing noises
   under boost?

There are more like running bad gas that limits boost from knocking, etc, etc.

So far, quite a few people have this 1.2bar part throttle condition.  It seems
to be normal.  The guys with drilled cycling valves and shimmed wastegates
don't have this condition though.  That must be hard to modulate???  1.2bar
to 2.0bar all of a sudden.  I'm going to investigate this further until I
figure out what causes it, because I know Paul doesn't like it, especially
since mine does not do that.
