Colin -Regarding the hatch adjustment, there should be a slot in the end of
the "peg" that you can put a standard screwdriver into (but, you better use
the heftiest you have that fits).  Then you can adjust it in or out until
correct - in your case, it sounds as though it is extended too far, thus
preventing the hatch from drawing down tight enough, otherwise, if it was
not extended far enough, your hatch would not latch at all on that side.
Be sure to thoroughly clean the latches and then apply some lubricant (I
prefer white lithium grease) to both the latches and pegs.  Hope this
helps.
