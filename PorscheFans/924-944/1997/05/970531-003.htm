Thanks.

Some more info amd summary on shock advice that had been given to me:

First, what shock to choose:

The alternatives are Sachs/BOGE, Bilstein and Koni Red and Yellow. 
Reputedly, the VW 1303 strut is identical, so other aftermarket shocks
may fit. The would not have the right damping profile, so beware.

Most people recommended adjustable Sport Konis, and I liked the idea of
being able to finetune (and wear compensate). Bilstein dampers have a
very good reputation too, but are harder to find. No one cared much for
Sachs/Boge.    

Jason Burkett of Paragon quoted me the best price for Sport Konis, and
the only reason for not buing from Paragon was the fact that the fright
to Sweden would cost to much. Amazingly, even when allowing for the
expensive freight to Sweden, Paragon was very close to the same price as
my local 'cheapest source'!

To see wether you have a rebuildable strut, the giveaway is the threaded
top of the strut tube. No threads, no rebuild. A quick look may give you
a false impression as the welded rubber bumper stop looks a little like
the screw lid.

When considering a rebuild or a complete new strut the following must be
observed:

There has to be no cracks or dents in the tube or the clamp. The coil
seat on the tube must not be rusty. If dirt is present in the spring
cup, water (damp) will be always present and sometimes cause severe
corrosion on the spring cup. This condition makes the strut unusable.
That is why there is three small holes in the cup, to drain water from
it. If there is any (severe) corrosion, the strut must be discarded. A
coat of rust inhibiting black paint will do no harm.   

There are complete struts available from Sachs/Boge as well as from Koni
and I was quoted 'original equipment' complete struts from the Porsche
dealer at about 125 % of the street price for Konis. Obviously, prices
are very varied.   

Settings recommendations:

Generally, all adviced me to keep the aft dampers at their softest
setting, as harder settings gave easier wheel spin. Front settings was
recommended to be at one valve revolution up from softest or one rev
down from hardest. No one suggested keeping it at factory setting, full
soft neither at full hard. One list member suggested different front
settings (not much) as performance driving usually is done with one
person in the car.   

Thanks, to all who responded to my questions !
