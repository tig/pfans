The 89 944NA engine (2.7) has an 10.9:1 compression ratio, according to 
the owner's manual.  The 968 is 11:1.

I haven't been able to confirm whether my '89 944NA has a knock sensor or 
not.  I'm pretty sure it doesn't, can someone confirm this?  I can't find 
a sensor bolted to the block anywhere that looks like a knock sensor.  My 
ex '85 GTI was knock sensor equipped - I'm suprised that every Porsche 
produced since that year is not knock sensor equipped.  However, the VW's 
of that era were just CIS, and not the more complex DME, so maybe that is 
a factor in controlling detonation.
