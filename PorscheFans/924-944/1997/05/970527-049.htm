Hi,

I took my 924S to an autocross and noticed that my newly installed clutch
was emitting a foul odor.  The launches were not any harder than thousands
I've done before in non-P cars.  Are the P-car clutches averse to hard
starts?  No wheel spinning, maybe between 1 and 2 seconds of slip at the
start to keep revs at 3000.   The pedal has good feel, and seems to have
adequate play at the top.  I didn't shift but once per run, and that was a
simple flick into second gear. In normal around town driving, it doesn't
smell.  Any ideas?

Also, I'm still looking for an M030 924S  or all the M030 suspension parts
to retrofit my museum fresh 1988 car. In addition, I'd like to inquire as
to who, if anyone, on the net might be able to recommend or take on the job
of such a retrofit.

Rich Fletcher
