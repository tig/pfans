Hello all,
	I just joined this list having just bought my first car.  It's a 1989 Porsche 944.  I love it, but I have had one strange problem.  
	When I turned off the interior lights one day while I had the doors open to clean the interior, I noticed that the clock stopped working.  Not the one on the radio, but the one in the dash fascia.  Then I tried to switch the interior light setting so that they would come on when the door was open but off when not.  The problem started when they would not come on, in any of the three positions of the switch.  Then I noticed that if I turned the switch to the middle (always off) position, the digital clock would go off.  In the other two positions, the clock would work ok.  So, the two questions I have are:
	1) why does the interior light switch turn off/on the clock?
	2) why, when I turned the lights off, would they not work again, but worked the next time I got in the car?

	Could this be a loose wire, or a faulty fuse?  I could not find anything in my Haynes manual or the owner's manual about this.  Thanks.

Benjy Edwards.
