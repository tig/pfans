My '86 951 does EXACTLY the same thing.  I have often wondered if this was
normal or not, but never really been too concerned.  As long as the fans come
on at some point and the temp goes back down, I'm ok with it.  But it would
be nice to know if this is normal operation or not.  Does anyone know??

Subject: '89 951 Cooling Fan Question

     I have noticed lately that the cooling fans on my '89 951 do not turn 
     on until the water temp. gauge reaches the second slash on the water 
     temp. gauge From what I have read the second slash indicates water 
     temp of 100 C. Once on, they stay on until everything is cooled to the 
     first slash then they shut off. Is this normal? Should the fans turn 
     on at a lower temp? When driving the temp stays just above the first 
     slash, but when sitting at a stop the gauge goes to the second slash 
     before turning on the fans. Does this indicate a bad thermoswitch? 
     Please advise.
