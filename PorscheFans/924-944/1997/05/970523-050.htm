Hi all,


It is probably your balance and timing belts.  You'll hear the bastards at idle
and at low rpm.  They make a soft whining (whooshing, whiring) noise, which
increases in pitch as throttle increases.

About 90% of all 944's I've listened to, have this noise.  You can try
adjusting the belts so that the whining isn't as loud, or you can simply live
with it.  Generally too loud of a whine (who knows what too loud is) either
means one of your rollers are going bad or your water pump is going bad.  The
cross check for the water pump is to look for leaking anti-freeze around the
pump roller.

In my case, the car never whined before I had the rollers done.  Now with new
rollers (and belts, and water pump) the car whines all the time (and the belts
are properly tensioned).  I've put a stethoscope to all the rollers while the
car was running (not the safest thing in the world) and they all pretty much
sound the same.

The sound may just be a property of the rollers.  For instance my car whines
louder when it is cold than when it is warm.  Maybe the rollers need to warm up
to operate at maximum efficiency.

Another theory is that the whining comes from the balance shaft belt hitting
the idler roller.  The balance shaft belt is toothed on both sides, while the
idler roller is smooth.  If the noise is coming from this, you can try and
adjust the roller.  It is supposed to be .5 mm from the lower part of the belt.

This weekend I'm retensioning my belts.  I might experiment with running the
car without the balance shaft belt and see if that is the culprit of all the
noise.
