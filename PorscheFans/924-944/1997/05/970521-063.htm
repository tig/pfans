I've got 231.6 clean, continuous watts going to each of my two 10" JL-Audio
W6's, and I haven't experienced any rattle problems with the hatch (speakers
located in rear luggage compartment too).  However, depending on the songs I
play and their respective frequency characteristics, I do hear some rattle
from the rear-wiper motor cover (the black, plastic shroud that hangs
beneath the wiper and glass).  I've tried using rubber grommets between the
metal tabs and plastic, but it hasn't completely solved the problem.  Has
anyone figured out an innovative way to secure the rear-wiper motor cover so
that it doesn't rattle anymore?
        By the way, using rubber grommets on the license plate frame also
prevents that from rattling too.  If the frame bangs on the license plate
bracket, though, try wrapping rubber bands around the bracket's 2 lower arms.
