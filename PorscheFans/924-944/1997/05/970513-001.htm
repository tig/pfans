they are a waste in your z although this is only one side of the coin on the 
other you need a roll cage and a lot of other suspension if you plan on racing 
it. the truth about american cars is they are not meant to go to the track 
anymore, and i will wager a LOT on the fact that a 83 944 NA would post faster 
lap times because of the handling benefits. My other car is a 88 Mustang and it 
is great in a straight line but i have taken it off roading (not purposely) 
twice.  they are too heavy, rely on poor braking and soft suspension, and for 
that matter they dont even have good steering response. now this is just from 
the 20 or so that i have driven, so yours could be different but i doubt it.

tech: you need a brace for the 5 pt. harnesses probably to be installed behind 
the front seats and will go all the way across them.  if you take it to someone 
for the install they are going to go after you with a shotgun because 
installation is from what i hear a pain, a big pain!!!  you can use the factory 
seats but i hope no females ever ride in your car because crotch straps arent 
too cool!!!!
