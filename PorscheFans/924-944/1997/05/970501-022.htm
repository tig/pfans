IMHO it would quicken the rear only transient response. Then car would
rotate faster in the rear which may feel like there is less understeer
because you may be promoting oversteer. Overall effect may be quicker
turn-in. Experiment, but I would think with a stock suspension stiffer
front and rear shock settings would be the quickest for turn-in.

Well since I mostly autocross race, this sounds like a slalom section of
the race course. The quickest way thru has been discussed on the autocross
list ad-nauseum, complete with mathematical equations on sinusoidal waves.
Was way beyond my understanding and I recall there was never any final
conclusion. Based on my 12+ years race experience there are 2 main methods
thru the slalom, 1) fairly steady throttle thru and 2) on and off the
throttle during the transition to help change the car' direction. I've
tried both and use a combination of the 2. Whichever is faster for you is
probably best.

Where there is a series of cones in the slalom, remember the turn-in is
not at the cones but rather somewhere in the middle between them. So as
you pass at the cones you are not generating max. cornering force. If
there is an auto-x driving school in your area I would recommend checking
it out, as this is a common exercise used in our schools.
