Doubtful you will feel anything as that is within about 10% of the spec'ed
tension and probably tighter than many belts with 15K miles on them.

The deal on that a precise and accurate setting is easier to see on the
flywheel than the cam sprocket. This is mostly because there is a heck of
a lot of ambiguity in the sprocket alignment marks because they are fairly
wide. Since the engine makes two revs to each camshaft rev the width of
those marks get multiplied by two at the flywheel. Have someone turn the
engine (or turn it yourself if you can) while you watch the flywheel marks
line up. Then look at the cam marks while you turn it a little more. The
cam marks will still be lined up but the flywheel mark will be long gone.

On mine there is a "0T" stamped just before the line. Do you see that?

Line up the flywheel and _then_ look at the camshaft. See above 2:1 stuff.

Yes, they should all be lined up at the same time. If you are off, you slipped
something when you put the belts on. You're doing all this cranking by hand,
aren't you?

Use the flywheel as the mother of all indices! If anything else is off you
have slipped a belt at some point.

I suspect you will find everything properly indexed if you use the flywheel
as the reference. Don't sweat it too much if you haven't removed the belts.

Hang in there.
