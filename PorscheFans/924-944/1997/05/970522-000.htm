Thanks for the tip, Farzaan.  I use the Repcos for my car (street
currently)
and they seem to work very well.  I did slot my rotors though--perhaps
this
achieves the same result.  Do you have slotted or cross drilled rotors?

I tried this out last night.  I'm running the AutoThority Stage II (2.7)
chips.
I can pretty much hit any boost level up to 1.8 indicated without using
WOT.
My car has a repaired cycling valve--I broke one of the plastic hose
mounts
while working on my car and a friend replaced the broken plastic mount
with
a piece of metal.  I don't know if this could be affecting anything, but
it
seems to be working fine.
