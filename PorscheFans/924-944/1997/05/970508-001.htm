All 'internal combustion engines' are compromises. The main parameters
will be cost, power and reliability. 

The Porsche 928 and 944 engine were basically laid out, in 1976 - the
928 came in -78). At that time an all aluminum engine, with Nicasil
coated cylinder liners and OHC was 'state of the art'. The 944 engine
had a power rating around 68 hp/liter displacement - pretty good at the
time, but in no way outstanding. The early Turbo and other refinements
have made this engine in its last european 968 NA version reach around
238 hp. We are still under 100 hp/liter - wich many engine builders
claim to be 'easily achievable'.
  
For any given power output there will be a 'life expectancy' number. At
very high power this number will be low, obviously. Porsche, building
'quality cars' and with a reputation to protect, obviously put this
number on a basically low low leve. This is witnessed by the very large
mileages on our cars, compared with other high performance cars, before
serious engine rebuilding is really necessary.  

By setting this 'number' differently with a Motronic programming
modification, you will just change the relation between power and
reliability - as there will be no additional strengthening of the basic
engine or any 'blueprinting' to really insure optimum balance and least
possible stress on the engine. You just rise the 'mean pressure' - the
most basic strength dimensioning value.        

For this 'low cost' power enhancing move, reliability (life expectancy)
will be less - but the price/performance ratio is excellent. No other
modification comes even close. 

Now, there is the well known nr 2 bearing oil supply problem and the
weak head gasket to make sure that this is not overexploited. 

.... As always, pay and play. 

Have fun
