Naweed has a good point here.  I've got almost every brand of chip ready here
for the dyno test day.  I've got old Autothority, latest Autothority, Turbo Cup
computers, stock, and latest Weltmeister.  We've also got a wide array of
car configurations we will be testing.  We have an 87 Turbo with the first
gen autothority.  We have an 89 turbo with Weltmeister with wastegate shim
and 3.0bar FPR.  We have my car with Turbo Cup and drilled cycling valve and
then we have Paul's (89T) with first gen Autothority and a new set sitting
here we'll test also.  Paul's uses the boost bolt.  Should be interesting.

I've tested almost every chip in my car now so I can give subjective 
comparisons.  If you are interested, email me at fkassam@direct.ca and I
can provide some info.

BTW - some Autothority chips have some horrible flat spots.  They seem to be
      car to car independant, so your car may just have a flat spot.  People
      with the flat spot can try all they want to remove them, sending the
      chips back to APE, but in all cases I've heard, APE has not been able
      to fix the flat spots because they can't replicate them.  The same 
      chips in another car usually don't produce the flat spots.  The only
      remedy I've seen is to use the Weltmeister.  The only real difference
      between the kits is the 3.0bar FPR, so the flat spots must be coming
      from a fueling problem (maybe even a clogged fuel filter or something?).
