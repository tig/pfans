No need to drill.  If your 944 is anything like my 924, there is a good
ground just to the left of the spare on the flat, just below the left tail
light assembly.  I found a good trick for mounting amps in the fender
wells/spare tire compartment.  I bent a piece of aluminum plate and hung it
from the edge down into the compartment.  I them mounted my amps to it.  I
have one in the left wheel well and one just in front of the spare tire.  I
only needed to use two self drilling sheet metal screws on the rim of the
compartment.

Sub box anchoring was easy too.  Now I am assuming that the 944 has this as
well. The 924 has two threaded tubes about 10mm tall welded on to the
surface of the deck, above the fuel tank.  I have no idea what for, but I
made two L brackets and bolted them to those spots.

Hope this helps,

Jay

P.S. Wanna make a solid rear hatch start to rattle?  Try a 10" sub tuned
down to 28Hz with 150 clean watts powering it mounted in the rear luggage
compartment. =)
