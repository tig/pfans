Hey, my 924 has a working speedometer, but the odometer is stuck at
79,000 miles.  I've read references to this problem on the list before,
and with the aid of a Haynes manual (every auto parts store seems to
carry 924 & 944 Haynes manuals down here) I removed the speedometer. 
Now, can someone tell me how to open it up?? I removed the two screws on
the back, but I can't seem to be able to coax it open.  I understand
that I should look for a broken gear, then epoxy it onto the shaft, but
any other details would be helpful.  Oh, by the way, can anyone tell me
about the color on my car?  It is a deep brown, with a gold pinstripe,
and though there is no evidence to suggest this is not the original
paint, I have not seen this color on a Porsche before, and the local
paint shop insists it is not original.
Thanks,
Travis Bowles
