I've installed an amp in the back of my 944, without drilling any
holes!!!  For that ground wire, I used the ground bolt for the tail
light on the left side. Just make sure you put the amp's ground wire
under the tail light's ground wire, since it draws the most current. 
This is a VERY short run if your amp is located in the left rear
compartment.  The amp is mounted onto plywood, which is attached to the
car with sheet metal which hangs on the ridge above the compartment. 
When the positive wire is run up to the firewall, notice that Porsche
engineering has triumphed again, supplying you with a rubber grommet in
the battery compartment which you can poke a hole through to run your
wire, thus eliminating the need to get out your drill.

The woofer box I use is my own custom-designed-for-944 dual chamber for
2 Rockford Fosgate 8" Punch's.  These speakers require the smallest
volume of any speaker I've seen for a sealed enclosure.  And a smaller
box is what we'd all want when looking at the space in the back hatch
area.  If anyone wants the dimensions for this box let me know.  It fits
right up against the back seat, and is short enough so that you can pull
the vinyl hatch cover over it.  This box will give you more bass than
you need if powered with 200 watts(unless you listen to rap), and will
sound better than trying to tear apart your rear speaker areas just to
upgrade from 4x6's to 6x9's.

>I guess I'll also have to strap down my subwoofer box if I ever do driver's ed. 

Not at all.  I've autocrossed with this amp and box many times at a
parking lot and a figure-8 track without them even budging (note that
the box must be carpeted, to yield an appropriate coefficient of
friction with the hatch carpet).  Your box may be taller, though.
