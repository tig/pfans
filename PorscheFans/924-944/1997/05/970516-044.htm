Symptoms: Sunroof will not open or close.

1) When the ignition key was in #1 position, I pressed the switch (down)
and the arms retracted fully into the roof, releasing the panel
completely (as it should have).  When I press the rocker switch in the
opposite position, the arms do not extend back into the panel like they
should.  The gear arms are now "stuck" in the retracted position.

2) When I press the button to retract (With the ignition key in #1
position)... Since the arms are already retracted nothing happens but
the relay clicking (in the rear driver's side fender).

3) When I push the rocker switch in the other direction (extend arms)
nothing happens and there is no relay click.  When the ignition key is
in the #2 position, nothing happens when I rock the switch in either
position, and there are no relay clicks.

WHAT I HAVE CHECKED:
I've looked under the dashboard for loose wires, found nothing (is there
something specific I should be looking for?)

I checked all the fuses... Interestingly, #35 was blown, and my chart
says it is a spare.  I replaced it, but it had no effect on the sunroof.

I also cleaned the contacts on relay G21 (sunroof) under the hood, and
the two relays in the rear left fender.  I also swapped the relays to
see if it had any effect (it didn't).

I removed fuse #1 and the relay still clicked with ignition key at #1,
when I pressed the button to retract.  I was suprised, I thought that
removing the fuse would disable the sunroof completely. (Maybe that is 
fuse #36)?

ADVISE NEEDED:

I doubt that the wires have come loose from the rocker switch, but I'm
willing to look.  Do I have to remove the entire shift panel to inspect
the underside of the switch?

I've verified that the microswitch in the header is depressed, is there
a way to expose the wires so that I can check the continuity?

I've had absolutely no problems with this roof, and until it stopped
working I used to operate it several times each week.  Any other
suggestions before I give up and go to the dealer?
