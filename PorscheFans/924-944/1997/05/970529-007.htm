It kind of makes you want to move back home doesn't it?  I grew up in
London, England, and always had respect for the COPs (which incidentally came
from British language, meaning Constible On Patrol) and did not have any fear
of them.  In the US, I am very fearful of the police here, especially those
who have a "kings**t cop" attitude.  I don't drink at all, so I never have to
worry about getting a DUI or something like that, but I still get hassled when
I go through DWI checkpoints here.  Maybe it's just being a foreigner and
driving a really nice car, I don't know.  One time I was coming home late
one night from work and passed through a DWI checkpoint that was down the road
from where I lived (I mean walking distance too).  I had been late for work and
had consequently forgotten my wallet with driver's license at home.  I told
the officer that I had just gotten off work and that I did not even drink.
I even offered to go get my license and come back to the checkpoint, but no
he wouldn't hear of it.  This was one of those "kings**t cops" with the "I have
a gun and a badge and I'll do whatever the hell I feel like to you" attitude.
He could very obviously see that I was sober, but he still made me get out of
my car.  After actually yelling at me while lecturing to me (I don't even
remember what he was lecturing me about because I was actually fearful for
my safety) he proceeded to give me a $75.00 ticket.  And then, to top it all
off, he said he was going to arrest me and "take my ass to jail"!!  Just
because I made an honest mistake of not having my driver's license on me.  I
gave him my driver's license number (memorized it in the past for some reason)
but that was not good enough for him.  Fortunately for me, his superior came
over and let me go - I still had the ticket.  I'll be damned if I was going
to pay $75.00 for something like this, so I went to court and the magistrate
was sympathetic to me and threw the entire thing out of court.  No fines or
anything - just a lot of aggrevation and hassle for me though.

I will never forget that night, even though it happened several years ago and
I was only driving a Mazda RX-7.  Even now when I go through DWI checkpoints
in my 951 the police are still very "abrasive" to me.  So I'm _extremely_
careful about always having my license and even proof of insurance with me.
I'm really careful about what I say also - I mean I don't want to piss these
guys off by saying the wrong thing.  It's like I have to walk on eggshells
around them in order to stay out of "trouble" and I haven't even done anything
wrong!  I don't drink, I don't drive recklessly, I don't speed in high traffic
areas - I'm your basic law abiding model citizen, but I'm still fearful of
the police in this country.
