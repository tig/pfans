Regarding the uncooperative service manager at Porsche dealerships, I have a
few suggestions that have worked well for me:

1. write down precisely what you want to have done on 2 pieces of paper - 
   leave one on the center console (so the mechanic can see for himself what
   needs to be done) and give the other to the service manager

2. the service manager should then write down on the work order what you need
   to have done to the car - verbatim from your list

3. don't even bother asking the service manager if you can speak to the
   mechanic - just walk back there and introduce yourself to the mechanic as
   the owner and politely tell him you have a couple of concerns and issues
   you want him to check out

4. I know all dealerships have the standard sign "...insurance regulations
   prohibit us from allowing customers in the work area..." but I have found
   that service managers will leave me alone if I am discussing my car with
   they guy who's working on it right then and there

5. remember, don't ask, just do it!

   IT IS EASIER TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS (oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know I wasn't
                                        allowed to speak to the mechanic)
   THAN IT IS TO ASK FOR PERMISSION (may I please speak to the mechanic who
                                     will be working on my car?)

Good luck.
