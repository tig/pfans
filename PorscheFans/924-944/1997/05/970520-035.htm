Greetings.  I once again want to thank the teeming millions for their
invaluable assistance.  I solved my odd clunking noise (I think).  It
appears to be a bad or missing brake shim.  I still am working on the
low-rpm hesitation.
I read a thread where people are wondering about having a knock sensor
in their car.  Well I am lucky enough to have the window sticker that
came with my car.  It states on the standard feature side that it does
in fact have a knock sensor.  I have an  86 951.  I don't know if that
helps, but thought I would throw it in. 
Other than the expensive dealership, does anyone know where I can get an
inexpensive undertray (the black pan under the motor).  Mine is pretty
broken up.
One more thing.  My friend over here is trying to tell me that people
have put chevy v-8's in our wonderful autos w/o any frame or body
modifications.   Can someone please help me settle this argument?!?! 
If we got everyone on this list to chip in .25 then we could buy the
factory manuals and copy them or scan them onto a cd rom.  Wouldn't that
be nice?
