Hi All!
To make a long story short, I want to do the infamous 5-speed 0/16 Z  for
the later 5-speed swap.  I have all the parts for the conversion, although
there is one little catch, I am in Germany and the car is Michigan, near
Ann Arbor for anyone who knows it.  The price was right and I plan an
trying to bring the things over as "personal baggage" and just hope my mom
and dad didn't throw out my clothes because I won't have any space for them
after I lug this stuff ot the airport!  Anyway, what I'm getting at is the
torque tube and gerabox are a little cumbersome and I was wondering what
can be taken apart and what not in order to break the parts into the
smallest pieces which I can then put back together again.
I'd like to try to get the end cover off so I can put the gear cluster in a
carry on and save weight.  I have read in Haynes, however, that the pinion
shaft is in there and one must be careful about jossling the parts
around....

Is it possible to take the endcover and gear cluster out without things
becoming misaligned?  (I've done this with other transmissions with no
problems but I'm a little leary about this one)

What about the differential?

The torque tube is extremely long, and the bellhousing seems to be welded
on, no chance of taking that apart, I'm sure....

I of course would be grateful if anyone knew of a cheap way to get these
things out of the Fatherland (I am not in the military and they don't seem
to want to cut me a break and let me send stuff with them... if anyone here
is stationed near Frankfurt, let me know!!)

Any other hints about the swap are greatly appreciated!

Happy Mother's Day!
Happy Motoring!

That's a ONE after the arp!
