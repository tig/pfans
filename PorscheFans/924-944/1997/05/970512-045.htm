Hey dudes,

I just finalized my Germany trip plans.  I have a few questions for our
German list members.  Paul, myself and his younger brother are flying up
together.  We are leaving Vancouver, Canada on August 15th and should
arrive at Frankfurt on the 16th at 6:10am.

Our whole trip has turned into a big car trip so to speak.  We would
like to go to the Porsche museum, the Mercedes Benz factory tour,
take a lap of the N=FCrburgring (sp?), and manage to make it over to
the Ruf day on the 23rd.  I've emailed the PCA - Germany guys to give
us more information if the Ruf day is possible for us.  What we'd really
like to do (Paul and myself) is to do one of the slaloms.  It looks like
we will be stuck with a BMW 318 or a MB C180, both of which are not exactly
our 89 944 Turbos.  I'm sure you've picked up the hint by now.  Let
us know through private email if there are any alternatives to these
vehicles.

On the 26th, we are driving or taking the train to Switzerland and then
flying back from Zurich to Vancouver on the 31st.  If any of you guys=20
from those areas care to take us for a boot in your cars on the Autobahn,
by all means let us know. =20

I've always wanted to see the speedo needle close to 300km/h on the dash.
The closest I've come is 265km/h and that was where my driver point
premium would have surpassed my Mastercard limit :)

Farzaan.
