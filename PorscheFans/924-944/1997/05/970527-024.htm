Hello to All and especially Bill Tomko,

As a fellow resident of North Carolina and also a frequent visitor of our
neighbors to the north, the Commonwealth of Virginia, I too have been irked
by the attitudes of that government "up north".  

Here's how to outsmart those Barney Fife's, one state removed.  Tell them
you entered their fine state by way of any one of the many secondary roads
that do not have that infamous black "Radar detectors illegal" sign.  They 
once had a sign under it saying "and subject to confiscation", but I believe
the U.S. Constitution put an end to that.  I think the Blue Ridge Parkway is
still void of any such statutory notice, as is Hwy 49 between Roxboro, NC and
Clarksville, VA.  I went that route just last weekend on my way to Kerr Lake,
oh sorry, Buggs Island Lake to those isolationist Virginians.  (VA got a bit
pissed when a reservoir that straddles the state line was named for a North
Carolina man)  Anyway, these signs on secondary roads seem to come and go.  
I'm mostly fond of the "go" part.  I don't remember seeing "the sign" last
weekend, but I have mostly ignored them around Clarksville for years.  At 
various times, I've been eyeball-to-eyeball with the commonwealth's finest, 
Whistler Spectrum II sitting proudly on my dash, even powered up once or twice.
They've never even given it a second look.  I would guess the county mountie 
you encountered in Hopewell had not been treated well by his wife, girlfriend
and/or mother in recent days.
