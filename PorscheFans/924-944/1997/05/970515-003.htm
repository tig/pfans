Last week I sent a post regarding the updated clutch disk for 944 Turbos
from Porsche.

This turned out to be NOT what I was expecting.  The disk part number
951.116.011.15 is not like the Cup clutch disk.  In fact, when I examined
my original disk from my 1989 Turbo I found that the disk number was the
same!

Both have the same number of small springs that shatter (that is what
happened to mine) and look the same.

My guess is the latest update from Porsche is probably at least 8 years old.

I have returned this clutch and ordered a Turbo Cup clutch from Paragon
Products (thank you Jason) at a competitive price and with some special
needs addressed by Paragon.

I think I will shift more comfortably knowing the new clutch does not have
the what seems to be a weak link with the old part.

Marv

Post Script:

This is no way a negative reflection on my dealer.  I am thankful for their
efforts at trying to fill my needs.  I only regret that they could not get
better information themselves.
