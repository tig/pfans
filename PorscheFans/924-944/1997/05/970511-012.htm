I've had one in my car for about 3 months. No problem and my
mechanic says he sort of likes it. I get the impression that
he's stripped the threads on a crankcase once and he seemed to
be attracted to that aspect. The bolt that is removed DOES have
a magnetic thing for attracting filings. I'm not sure whether
the absence of this will make a difference.

I would be rather impressed if a low-life scum managed to find
the latch under the car. Most would be happy to merely scratch
something on the paint.
