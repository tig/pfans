Matt,

.... If the 968 had backing like the 986 (boxster) and had the company not had
the highly publisized money problems it would have succeeded and we might
have even seen a production 968 Turbo.  

  Actually, Porsche produced 2 varieties of the 968 Turbo. In 1993 the
produced the 968 Turbo S. Starting with Vin# WPOZZZ96 ZPS8 90001 - ?. This
car had the Motor Type M44/60, transmission type 644/00. Bore & stroke were
104/88, the displacement was 2990 (cm), Din/PS max was 305/5400 RPM,
compression was 8.5:1 wheel track front/rear was 1522/1500 (cm), length was
4320 (cm) and it weighed 1300 (kg) dry. Also in 1993 the 2nd type was the 968
Turbo RS. The difference between the S & RS were the Din/PS max was 337/5400,
the transmission type 644/02, the wheel track was 1530/1510 (cm) and it
weighed in at 1350 (kg) dry. Vin# started at WPOZZZ96ZPS8 96001 - ?.
  Not many of these cars were produced as they were supposed to be for a race
series here in Europe that never came to be. Cost for the RS was in the 250K
DM range. I don't know what the S cost was. These things are LIGHTNING fast,
they just cost too much to be a viable car for the public, especially when
you see what other cars they would be competing against in this price range.
(911 Turbo, Ferrari etc)
   Porsche also produced a 968 CS (Club Sport) which was basically a normal
968 stripped of all the electric dodads that came with the car. (No radio,
electric windows etc) This lightned up the car, but it still kept the same
engine/tranny as the normal 968. Again, this was a car that was not exported
to the U.S. Too bad as it is an auto x killer. Again though, like you said,
they had priced themselves right out of the market.

.... Porsche will have the same problems again as they are catering to a small
market (which i am fond of myself) so money will always be an issue.  Let's
just all be greatful for the 924/931 944/951 968/986 911/930.  

  Very true. I can't say how much I enjoy my 83 944 and 91 951.
