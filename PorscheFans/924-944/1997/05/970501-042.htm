P-fans:

I have noticed an increasing odor of gas fumes coming from the passenger side
rear of my 968 coupe for the past few weeks.  The odor is there when I first
get into the car after it spent the night closed up in the garage.  After a
few seconds of driving, the odor disappears via the ventilation system.  I
took the car to my dealer, and the mechanic "checked everything from the gas
cap to the injectors."  He found no problems.  Since I didn't leave it
overnight, he never actually smelled the odor.

I have found no gas leaks or anything besides the smell.  It seems to me that
we had a thread about this a couple of months ago.  Is there any place I
should look?  Even if I can't look there myself, I could use info on where to
suggest for the mechanic to look.

Thanks in advance.
