I have an 87 944 na with the Koni yellows that has been autox for 2 years.
The fronts are mostly set at 1 turn off full hard.  I tried almost full
hard on the rears and got wheel spin (no lsd at that time) in big 180
turns.  Changed the rear to full soft and things got better.  Added a stock
lsd and am thinking about firming the rears up a little.

I used Comp/TA ZR street tires the first year to learn the car and liked
them a lot.  I learned a lot about how the car handles but was not
competitive against cars with R compound tires.  Last year I got another
set of rims and Comp/TA R1 for autox and drivers ed events.  Wow!  They are
like magic.  I'm still in the steep part of the learning curve but am
satisfied that the few changes I have made are effective.
