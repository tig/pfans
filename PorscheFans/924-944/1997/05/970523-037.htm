>In working on the 77 924 yesterday, which has the aftermarket "PDP" A/C
>system, I noticed that one of the pipes connected to the compressor has
>broken out of the fitting, venting the system to the outside completely
>(sometime in the past, before I bought it). Fixing this (if it's the
>only problem w/ the system) should be relatively inespensive, but what

>does one go about getting replacements for this aftermarket system
>(since it's not factory)?

CHECK SYSTEM OPERATION
Jump the low pressure switch if it has one
With the car not running...key on...
     Turn on the A/C to confirm all electrics still operate.
          A/C clutch
          Radiator fans
          Evaporator fan (inside)
a/c off....Key off...reconnect low pressure switch

REPAIR  bad hose/ pipe  (hope it didn't damage the compressor ie threads
etc.)

REPLACE the dryer.

EVACUATE the system
(you will need a gauge set and vacuum pump)
block in system for about 40  minutes.
should see loss of vacuum as any H20 flashes off.
Pull the full vacuum down again 10 minutes or so.
Block in system again watch for loss of vacuum
continue to repeat 3 or 4 times till system holds vacuum.  
That means no more water and no major leaks.

(If system will not hold vacuum for 1 hour you have a leak.
look for oily lines etc. and/or have shop check for leak.)

If no leak all you need is a little R12/134a and you should have cold air.
If the shop did the evacuation,they can put a small amount in an check 
for leaks and complete the charge if all looks OK!

Good Luck!
