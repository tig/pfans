Of course!  It makes a whole lot more sense to have the compressor dealing
with only gases since a multi-phase pump is costly and not really
necessary.  Well, one of these days I'll get it straight!   =:-)  Thanks
for the correction.

At least I got the first part right, about water I mean.

What you're describing here is a sort of metering device and I was under
the impression that the receiver-drier was between the condenser and the
evaporator.  What I read here would be best suited between the evaporator
and the compressor, wouldn't it?

Either I've got it all wrong or maybe you're describing something else.
The higher outlet on the receiver-drier makes sense for separating liquids
and gases (liquids are heavier).  But the high-pressure side of this system
only extends to the expansion valve, so the compressor can't really suck
refrigerant from the receiver-drier directly-- it can only pull in what
refrigerant is found in the evaporator, which is essentially low-pressure
(at least compared to the condensor).  So, I'm not sure what you're
describing in terms of the compressor pulling refrigerant from the
receiver-drier.  Could you clarify?
