Roger, Something you might want to investigate is the air flow
sensor. I experienced a similar case on a Jag XJ6, (which BTW has a
Bosch injection system similar to the 944), unexplained stumble
and loss of power at certain rpm. What I did was pry the cover off the
air flow sensor (it is glued on with RTV). I then noticed that the
sensor is basically a potentiometer having a pair of wipers running on
a pair of carbon traces. The carbon surface was worn through in a couple 
spots which causes erratic data to be sent to the computer regarding air
flow.
Push gently on the potentiometer arms with a screwdriver at a ~45 deg 
angle down and towards the pivot shaft just enough to bend the arms
about a 1/16 inch. Just enough to shorten the effective radius of the
arms and cause the wipers to now run on virgin carbon. 
The results were dramatic! We had owned the car for a year and believed
that it was just naturally big and slow, boy were we wrong!! This little
trick really smoothed out the acceleration and improved our mileage by
several MPG.
I believe that any vehicle approaching 100K miles with the original
sensor could benefit from this little "tweek". Oh and the best part was
it took less than 10 minutes.

Hope this helps.
