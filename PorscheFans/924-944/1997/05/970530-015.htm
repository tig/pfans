I just purchased a new '91 944 s2 cab last week ....

Hmm, I've never had to do that.  When I retract the top, it just goes 
down all the way.  All I do then is drape the boot over the top and snap 
it on --- I don't need to push or press anything.

I think I have those too, however I don't think it's a symptom of 
installing the boot (or maybe in your case you think that pressing the 
top down to install the boot does this).

Before I purchased my car, I got a write up from another kind PorscheFans
subscriber which described this symptom of small fabric tears ... it looks
like the little 1"  long tears on the rear fabric are a result of the
fabric binding in the mechanical pieces of the roof. I believe it's a
common problem with the 944 cabs. 

When you retract the top, do it slowly (having a friend help would be 
handy) and take note of any fabric binging you see.  My roof has a 
particular problem where the back window will not fold down correctly no 
matter what I do -- I usually have to retract it half way, fix the 
window, and then continue.  Also, check out your headliner to make sure 
fabric isn't binding anywhere in there. If your roof is not retracting 
all the way, I say first check for obvious obstructions (like binding 
fabric) and then check out the motor/cable assembly (perhaps you have 
slack somewhere). As I said before, other than my window, I don't have 
any trouble retracting my roof.

I don't know exactly how the roof mechanicals work ... ie, does the roof 
stop because the motors wound up the tractor cables, or is there some 
sensor somewhere which triggers the motors to stop?  Anyone else know?

Hope some of that helps ....
