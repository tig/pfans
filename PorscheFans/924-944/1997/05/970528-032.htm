Hi All!,

I have had  a 1982 (U.K.) 944 Auto for the last four months which I bought
from a friend returning to Japan after a few years here in England. It has
been fantastic so far and I have not come across any nasty supprises yet!

I've been doing all the basic service jobs over the last couple of weeks and
now have only to change the transmission fluid. My question is what do I
refil with? The Haynes manual says Dexron II, the owners manual says ATF
(Decron). Does it make much difference if I use one or the other? I've had
bad experiences with Auto transmissions before so I realy would like to get
this one write!

Also, I'm feeding the 944 with 98 RON leaded fuel at the moment as per the
owners manual. Can I safely switch to Unleaded or will this kill the valve
seats? I'm not too bothered about the slight performance reduction with the
lower octane unleaded as long as it does no harm

Thanks

Malcolm Holmes
