When I first got my 944 (87 S). My passenger door handle trigger wouldn't
release. I had it this way for several months. One day, while I was at the
workshop getting a new clutch, one of the guys tried to open the door. Of
course he couldn't so he got out the magic WD-40 and sprayed. Spent about 5
minutes working the trigger back and foward. Voila, it has worked fine ever
since. I felt pretty stupid, I had never looked since I assumed the previous
owner had tried this.

One more. After months of dashboard rattle (around the air vents in the centre)
I looked at the vent and saw that there are three screws. In the compartment,
below the radio, I have had a phillips head screw driver since I got the car. I
tightend up the screws and no more rattle. (Now I hear the rear hatch, but
thats another story :-(.  ).

Draw your own conclusions. (Except those that involve my IQ).
