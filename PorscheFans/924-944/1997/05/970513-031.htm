     Hi all - 
     
     I saw the recent note on someone wanting to go on factory tours in 
     Germany.  I was in Stuttgart recently and tried (unsuccessfully) to 
     get in a Porsche factory tour.  Apparently you need to sign up way 
     ahead of time or have an 'in'.
     
     I did go to the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen (right outside 
     Stuttgart/Boeblingen).  MB assembles the C and E series there.  
     Engines and transmissions are shipped in from another plant.  There's 
     a vistor center for new buyers to pick up their cars at the factory. 
     It is open to the public and we just walked in.  There are certain 
     tours during the day that are in both English and German.  The factory 
     tour lasts about an hour and was pretty interesting.  It went through 
     the assembly areas, press areas, paint booths, etc.  More factory 
     automation than I expected...  If you are in the area and have the 
     time, it's worth checking it out!
     
     Good luck
     
     Ted
