Are you referring to replacing the sunroof with a totally glass one?  If so,
from my own personal experience, it's not worth it.  The guy I bought my car
from had one specially made for it.

1.  it leaked
2.  it rattled like crazy and was very annoying, especially if I went over a
    pot hole or bump
3.  I lost a race to a BMW M3 because at over 100 mph the wind literally pulled
    one side of the glass out of the roof support and I had to hold the roof
    down with my left hand until I could slow down enough (and the roof was
    originally closed!)
4.  even though it was custom made, it just did not fit the car as well as the
    stock roof
5.  I didn't think it looked that great on my car anyway

I ended up selling it to someone for $150.00.  I guess if you want to use it
for touring and not racing on sunny days on perfectly smooth roads it'd be ok.  
That's my .02 cents worth, if it matters.
