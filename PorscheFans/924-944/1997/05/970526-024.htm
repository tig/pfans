I don't know what SCCA events you have been running, but out here on the 
west coast, the SCCA local (supplementary) rules require at least a 90 
degree corner before the start lights.

Most of the PCA events out here also use a practice lap before timed laps 
so the "out of the box" acceleration isn't really necessary.  Some of us 
do use those practice laps as "timed" laps since in the SCCA events they 
don't use practice laps.  This way, we get an extra lap and can also 
practice our "getting it right the first lap" apporach for our other 
sanctioned events.
