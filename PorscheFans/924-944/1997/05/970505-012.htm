There should not be any cylinder to hold it in place. If you hold the front
of the instrument cluster and wiggle the tacho out from the back it should
eventually come loose. The instruments are held in place by a rubber seal
around the edge, probably to keep from rotating or falling out, so some
resistance should be expected I suppose. But whatever you do - DON'T push
the instruments out through the back! The cheapo plastic cluster will
definitely break.
