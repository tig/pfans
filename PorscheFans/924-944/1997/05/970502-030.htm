Okay I know this has been discussed before, but I decided to tackle mine
last night.I've got a 1986 944 Turbo. I opened everything up cleaned it out
and repacked the bearings(bearing are in good condition, no pits, cracks or
other marring). After reinstalling them I adjusted it via the finger on
screwdriver just moves the thrust washer.  After I put the wheel on and
bolted it down I push/pulled the top of the wheel and I still get some
minor movement.  I tightened the bearing some more and I still have the
same amount of play in the wheel in the direction. It seems to me that it
is currently too tight. The rotor does not rotate as freely as I think it
should.  Any ideas? Is that little bit of motion supposed to be there?
Could it be the suspension or some related component. I know we have a few
experts out here...Thanks in advance
