Kevin,

This item has struck my attention now that I've reviewed my service
records.  I don't see anything referring to the transmission fluid being
changed.  My 944 now has 84k and I better go ahead and change the fluid
regardless if it has been done recently.  I definitely don't want to star=
t
one of these long threads, I'd just like to know the best fluid to use
(these types of questions usually get mixed results).

Thanks so much,

Michael Belfoure

> If by output shaft bearings they mean pinion shaft, here's what could
befall you.  I have a 944S2 transmission on my bench which had too much
preload on its pinion shaft bearings.  It is a little hard to tell what
happened first, heck, it's a little hard to tell what exactly happened at
all.
>=20
> But it seems that it ended up overheating the rear pinion shaft bearing=
,
which takes most of the load because the pinion shaft is essentially push=
ed
away from the ring gear.  The bearing spun in the end plate, placing one =
of
the bearing's shims into play, i.e., loose and into the works.  This shim
seems to have travelled to the nearest interesting spot: between 1st gear
on the pinion, its needle bearing, and the pinion shaft.  Needle bearing
freezes up tight, all kinds of material transfers to the first gear inner
surface and to the pinion shaft surface.  I had to press the needle beari=
ng
out of 1st gear!
>=20
> Bonus round: the pinion shaft, now with far less preload than before,
pounds along its axis, peening the splines between its and fifth gear, on
the other side of the end plate.  Fifth gear comes off the pinion shaft
only with significant encouragement and is now junk.  Remember, of course=
,
that the 944S2 has a unique fifth gear ratio not seen in any other 944
transmission - so not a lot of good used parts are for the having.
>=20
> Enough anecdotal rambling.  If all your car needs is corrected preload =
on
fifth gear, you are probably looking at six to ten hours labor.  If you
need to replace the pinion shaft bearings, it's probably an extra four to
six hours.  Shimming and setting up the pinion shaft bearing in the case =
is
a major pain in the butt.
>=20
> The bearings will normally last about 100K miles, perhaps longer, *if*
you maintain the fluid, like change it every 30K.  That's a major "if"
because I think that many folks tend to forget about transmission fluid.
