Boost pressure on the VDO guage is measured in PSI, vacuum is measured in
inches of mercury (I think it's mercury).  So, that would be 10psi which
sounds correct.  The factory "S" tech book says that the "S" model is
70mbar (~1psi) higher than the non "S" models under constant 3rd gear load.
If memory serves my right, the "S" models are 0.8?? bar so that would make the
non "S" around 0.73.  Your figures are pretty close so no problem there.

Hmmmm... interesting...  I wonder if that is a limitation of the non "S"
models.  Both Pauls car and my car have some serious boost in the mid range.
Mine peaks at 16.5-17psi, Paul's peaks at 19psi.  Both of ours drop down
at higher rpms to 14.0-14.5 for mine and 13.-13.5 for Paul's.  But then,
both of ours are "S" models.  Conditions also play a big role.  When it's
cold out and the air is dense, the boost pressure is higher.  Up in
Kelowna (high elevation), my boost would barely register 1.8bar on the
guage under WOT.  What elevation are you at and under what conditions did
you do the test?  What octane gas were you running?

To do a rough calculation converting bar to psi, multiply by 14.5.  To get
exact calculations, use the following web site
http://www.webcom.com/legacysy/convert2/convert2.html  They also have a 
downloadable computer program to do all sorts of conversions.  This program
was great when I was doing all the alignment stuff.

12.5 / 14.5 = 0.86bar or 1.86bar on the guage.
