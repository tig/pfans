Bart,

I use Mothers Aluminum Wheel Polish.  My Fuchs are in excellent shape so
I've never had to remove stains.  But my buddy has a Cutlass with factory
aluminum wheels and he came over yesterday fishing through my garage for
wheel cleaner.  I told him to try the Mothers and he couldn't believe how
well it worked.  He said it removed both water spots and stains.  He also
told me he didn't think the stains would ever come out.  

I bought the stuff because years ago my brother used it on his van that won
many awards at World of Wheels and like events.  You might give it a try.

Regards,

Michael Belfoure
