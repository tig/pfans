Raphael -- the original Passport runs on 9volts DC, and the plug you use
in the lighter socket probably has a transformer that steps down from 12
volts. If your Passport is old as mine (mid-80s) it came with all the
accessories: visor clip, extra suction cups, coiled cord, straight cord,
and a small transformer box. This is the direct-wire counterpart of the
special lighter-socket plug. 

If you cannot find this accessory, try dismantling your lighter-socket
plug, to the point where you can get 2 wires on the socket end (you may
have to unscrew/pry/break open the end of the socket terminals). Next you
will need to find a source of power that is hot on ignition, like the
radio hot lead. You will need to dig around behind the radio on the
driver's side footwell, but using a multi-meter a switched hot lead (12
volts) should not be difficult to find (usually a red wire). Next you will
need to splice the hot lead and a ground (any metal in the region, or the
ground lead to the radio, usually black) to the wires you just exposed in
the lighter-socket plug. Between the hot lead and the wire on the
lighter-scoket plug, add a 1 amp inline fuse. If you could not isolate
wires on the lighter-socket plug, soldering 2 lengths of speaker-wire to
the 2 terminals on the socket will work too, but you will need to make the
solder secure, and then tape the wire firmly to the socket to stop it
pulling and breaking contact. Add the 1 amp inline fuse on the wire
carrying +ve here too. 

Now that you have power find a route to the visor area, using zip-ties to
secure the lead. In my car power is drawn from the radio leads,
starting at the right of the steering shaft in the driver's footwell. The
wire goes across, under the shaft, into the driver's door rubber trim.
This part is easy, you will need a wide-blade screw-driver to stuff the
wire under thr rubber as you move up -- there is enough room all the way
to the top, between the dash and the door, and then between the windshield
and the A pillar trim. In my car the cord finally appears behind the
visor. 

I use the visor-clip to keep the Passport as unobtrusive as possible, and
after a while you get used to not using the visor. Also gets the detector
high up in the optimum position for the antenna.

I have used the direct transformer and do not quite remember what the
lighter-plug looked like so I can't give you any more specific
instructions. I hope this explains the general principle though: you
basically need a 9 volt power supply, from a switched power source. If all
works well your Passport should come on with that bleeeep-bleeep-bleep
every time you turn the ignition on.

If your coiled cord is too difficult to manipulate, cut the plug and the
lighter plug off, buy some 12-gauge speaker wire and solder in the
correct length -- this may be easier to route and stuff in the trim. When
I re-wired the Passport in the rear of my car I used an old coiled
phone-cord, and it was a pain to straighten out and stuff. As with any
electrical work, please disconnect the battery, make sure you are not
grounding anything, and fuse all suspect circuits before you power up.
