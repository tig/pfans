I  was there last month for the first time.  It was a well organized event
with about 100 drivers.  The site is on 4 connectd lots with 1 serving as
the pit areas and the course on the other 3.  Not much shade, so bring sun
block and water.

I started with 40 lbs front and back on my 944 and it worked fine for me.

a tire gauge might be useful for pressure adjustments between sessions.

Whatever you decide to do with the gas level, do the same every time.  It
did make a difference for me.  The car handled different when I went from
an almost full tank to about a quarter tank.

Make sure the car is emptied out including floor mats, garage opener,
mobile phone, etc.   They tend to fly around and get stuck under the pedal
you really want to use at that paticular time.

They start early in Akron, around 8am with the first car off by 10am.

Talk to the other competitors.  They're very friendly and will be glad to
help out.  Have fun
