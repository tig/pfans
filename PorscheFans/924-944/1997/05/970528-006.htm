Hi All;

I finally had a chance to try my new Hoosiers at the track over the weekend.
It was raining during the first run session so I left my street tires on for
the first run.  The track was drying out by the end of the first run so
switched to the Hoosiers for the rest of the day.  What a difference!  The
Hoosiers made the car feel much lighter and responsive.  I normally run BFG
R1s on 17" C2 urbo replica wheels.  As I mentioned last week, the Hoosiers
on 16" forged Club Sport wheels are about 10 pounds lighter per wheel.  It
made a very noticeable improvement on acceleration out of the corners and
speed down the straights.  On the R1s, 130 mph down the front straight at
Summit Point was about it if I wanted to be able to make turn 1 without
using the escape road.  With the Hoosiers, 130mph was easily attainable
without drama.

I like the Hoosiers more than the R1s, but I fear there will be a penalty
somewhere down the road.  Probably a much shorter life for the Hoosiers.
It's only money.

Tracy Meyer
