okay here it is the way to adjust those pesky door handles:
1.  remove the door panel , not friendly
2.  with it off you can see the piece you will need.
2a. if you have the haynes manual find the page on door handle removal
3. if not the remove the handle, there is a white plastic piece that sort of dangles down from thetrigger mechanism, you will see it if the handle is out.
4. turn the white piece until it is more loose than previous. because of the now longer reach the trigger is tighter and worksMUCH better (before i coulndt get it open now my 5 foot tall 100 pound girlfriend can with ease.
5. disclosures. it is a pain in the a@@ the white piece doesnt want to come off and there isnt much room to work. while ou are in there lube all the pieces well to insure good working later.

I have an 85.5 944 (also Alpine White) and my passenger door handle is the
same way.  I thought it was from the PO never using it.  It has actually
loosened up since I've purchased the car but my wife still can't open it.
I know, I know, I should open the door for her but to do that I have to go
to my side, shut off the alarm, then go back over - its easier just to hop
in the car and open the door from there.  

But I'd love to hear any suggestions for this problem.

BTW, anyone else with an Alpine White car - Are the rear fender decals a
brighter white than the paint on your car?  My car has spent its entire
life in a garage and when actually left outside for extended hours (such as
being at work), it has always been under a cover.  So I know the paint -
which is PERFECT - isn't faded.
