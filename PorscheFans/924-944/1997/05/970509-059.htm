Hey dudes,

Instead of opening up a huge can of worms across p-fans, I emailed jplee
directly to discuss the issue of his post.  This is what came from it.  The
reason why jplee was upset about my tramlining post was because he is
the seller of the wheels which he felt I made comments about.  This is,
in fact, false.  My comments about the wheels Tom was considering are for the
"off-the-shelf" OZ wheels in 17", not jplee's special custom made units.

From his previous for sale post(s), I determined that jplee's are a custom
offset that may not tramline, but Tom was referring to a different set than
jplee's.  Hope that clears my name up as well as the reason behind jplee's
post.

Farzaan.
