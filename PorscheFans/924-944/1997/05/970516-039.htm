"Nobody with a good car needs to worry about nuthin"

Since Fall, 1996, I've been just a lurker on this listserv, and have
found much reading enjoyment in it. This morning, I noted a reference to
my Porsche 944 page (at http://www.geocities.com/motorcity/1760) with
regard to 944's in a crash. Well, I just *had* to email the list and
testify to one of the 944's lesser known -- but no less legendary --
capabilities. Namely, saving your life in a total situation.

On a moonless night in September, 1995, I was heading to the coast (and
home) from San Francisco, having completed a writing gig at PC World
magazine. I was in my 85.5 944, black/burgandy leather, of which I was
the original owner. Almost exactly one month short of the ten year
anniversary of taking delivery of the car, I clipped a deer on
California Hwy 84 between Woodside and the Pacific Ocean, on the uphill
part. Hwy 84 is a twisty mountain road connecting Hwy 35 -- Skyline
Blvd. --  with Hwy 1 on the coast. It has plenty of rises, dips, and
off-camber, decreasing radius turns. It's ocassionally punctuated with
redwood duff, fog drip water, deer and the occasional rock that tumbles
off the hills above the road surface. No problem for a road that I call
my commute route.

To make a long story short, that night I ended up diving the car some 50
feet vertical, and 100 feet horizontal. A head-on square into a downed
redwood. As I left the road surface at, oh, 35 MPH I hit the asphalt
berm real hard and brushed a very large redwood with the passenger side
fender. Hitting that berm, I launched upwards a little, and was then
subject to pure Newtonian physics. It was clear air all the way to my
car's final resting spot, other than chopping down a small tree of some
6-inch diameter, which I mowed about halfway down the canyon.

You can read the whole story at http://www.motorcity/1760/agoodcar.html

A few months later, when a deal came up to buy another 944, I jumped at
it. After all, the 944 saved my life and I figured I'd stick with a
winner. So now my daily driver is an 84 Sapphire Metalic/tan that's been
tweeked and modified a bit. In case you have to ask, YES I had my
seatbelt on during the Porsche flight! That seatbelt is the only reason
you are reading my words now.
