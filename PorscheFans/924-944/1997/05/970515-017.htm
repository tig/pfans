Hi All,

I guess you guys are a little biased, but I'll ask anyway.  I 
currently own a 85.5 NA 944, and a Maserati Biturbo 425i.  I just put 
the Maser back on the road after a long and harsh winter, and now have 
a dilemma.  The 944 feels like a much more capable car overall.  It is 
definitely better built (big surprise there), and is easier to drive 
fast and hard because of its handling.   But the Porsche is missing 
two things: the wonderfully addictive thrust when I put my foot down 
with the Maser, and what I can only describe as that delicious 
combination of sights, sounds, and feel that I call CHARACTER!  I 
haven't had the Porsche out on the track yet, but I think it will 
probably out-handle the Maser given the neutral competent feel ( 
upgraded to turbo suspension, brakes and wheels).

So the dilemma is: how do I combine the two?  This has started me 
thinking about trading both in on a 911.  What do you guys think?  The 
911 seems to have more character than the water-cooled Porsches ( 
don't get mad, that is just my impression), and would surely have more 
power than my NA 944.  One of my questions is, is the handling on the 
911's as good as the 944 (I'm no Villeneuve)?  What about reliability 
compared to 944's (when you own a Maser this becomes important)?

Although I love the "feel" of the Maser, it is not a terribly reliable 
car :-),  I think it is time to get rid of it.  But how do I replace 
the excitement of driving it?  Should I just shut up and be happy with 
what I have?
