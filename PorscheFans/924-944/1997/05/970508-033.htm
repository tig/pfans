I have an 85.5 944 (also Alpine White) and my passenger door handle is the
same way.  I thought it was from the PO never using it.  It has actually
loosened up since I've purchased the car but my wife still can't open it.
I know, I know, I should open the door for her but to do that I have to go
to my side, shut off the alarm, then go back over - its easier just to hop
in the car and open the door from there.  

But I'd love to hear any suggestions for this problem.

BTW, anyone else with an Alpine White car - Are the rear fender decals a
brighter white than the paint on your car?  My car has spent its entire
life in a garage and when actually left outside for extended hours (such as
being at work), it has always been under a cover.  So I know the paint -
which is PERFECT - isn't faded.
