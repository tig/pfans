Hi Guys,

> > I'd take the 944 any day, and I especially love it when

While I love the look of the 944, lets admit that it isn't perfect.

The lower rear of the car leaves a lot to be desired. The area under
the bumper lookes like Porsche forgot to finish it. Having the 
spare tire well show is IMHO, inexcusable. The turbo looks a little
better, due to the lower apron wing, but it too is not perfect.

Also, the area between the tailights looks poor. The aftermarket
kits to fill that in really cleans that area up. It's kind of
silly when you have to buy a $100 plastic cover to complete the
look of your expensive (when new) sports car. The problem with
those kits is that have to relocate the license plate to the
bumper, which spoils the smooth line of the bumber.

Other than that, I love the exterior look and lines of the car.
