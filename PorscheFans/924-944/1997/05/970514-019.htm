It was a beautiful afternoon yesterday...About 60 degrees, a tad overcast,
but pretty, overall. Stopped by my apartment, grabbed some Miles Davis, Joni
Mitchell and YES CDs... and headed for the parking garage down the street to
get my baby out. 

As I approached the garage (which has a monthly fee that should be
outlawed)...there she was..waiting for me like a sultry lover. Gleaming
black...freshly detailed...begging for a good drive.

I gently placed my guitar on the passenger seat, got in...fired her up and
drove off to the studio to put down some tracks. Ah...life is good...(Well,
as soon as you get out of friggin' Manhattan's traffic and hit the open road,
that is.)

I cruised down the Turnpike, doing a good clip, of course, (this ain't
Montana, mind you...but we can whale an occasional 80-85 round these parts
too...) and got off on 278, which is a STEEP uphill ride to the West Caldwell
exit. Now I know you folks mock on Jersey once in a while, but this is one of
the nice parts. Smooth, winding roads....green country-side...trees...did I
mention smooth roads?

Herein lies my problem...I've got Starship Trooper blasting out what's  left
of my eardrums, the sunroof up, windows down----we're talking Nirvana
folks...when all of a sudden....OH NO!!!   This can't be!     

It seems as though a piece of dust, or pollen, or schmutz, or WHO KNOWS...was
on my DASHBOARD!   MY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN, BLACK DASHBOARD....THE NERVE!!!
   Plus, to ad insult...it was all the way on the other side, just out of
reach.
(I know that some of you know where this is going...)

Let me tell you this...In the split second that it took me to reach over and
remove that piece of pestilence from my rolling  shrine...a dopey dawggie ran
out into the middle of the street and I came damn close to having Irish
Setter Stew all over the grill and hood!  (I love dogs by the way...but if it
was between Rin Tin Tin biting the big one...or my black beauty finding a
ditch....there was no contest.

Well, God must drive a Porsche in that Autobahn in the sky, cause the Setter,
made it accross the street just dandy and the machine I call my car, pulled
out without a hitch.

THE LESSON:   Don't take yer eyes off the road!  (even for dirt
particles!!!!)
