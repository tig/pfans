Just an A/C overview guys.

You MUST have liquid refrigerant between the condenser and the evaporator.

The compressor compacts gaseous refrigerant raising the pressure (200psi or
so) but also
 raising the temperature(180F or so)

The condenser drops the temp and causes the gas to go to liquid at this
pressure.

The dryer removes any moisture that could freeze at the expansion
valve/evaporator.

At the expansion valve the liquid is at 200 or so psi and roughly 80-100F,
where is is dropped in
pressure to the suction side pressure (35psi) and the liquid flashes back to
gas.  As gaseous refrigerant's temp is directly proportional to it's pressure
( and vice verse) the temp in the evaporator becomes about 38F.

If your system charge is slightly low the temps will be lower.  That's why a
low system will freeze the moisture out of the air onto the evaporator
blocking the airflow over it! (BAD)
 
After that it's back to the compressor and the cycle continues.

Properly serviced the system will have a column of liquid refrigerant from
the expansion valve back to the sight glass on the dryer (at least)

WHALAA  no bubbles... COLD AIR!


As for the the 134a conversion. 

The trade magazines are recommending...
Pull the compressor and  dump all the oil possible. 
Fill with compatible 134 oil.
Flush the system with 141 (stays  liquid @ room temp). 
Reinstall compressor
Change the dryer and seals... the service schrader valves (an adapter to
prevent R12 service)
Reservice with 134a and compatible oil.

The only question is... are the hoses on our p-cars barrier type?
A/C hoses that aren't will pass the smaller 134a molecules and leak down over
time.

As both of mine were reserviced with R12 I don't know the answer to that
question!
........Anyone... Anyone.... Behuler....Behuler

For anyone wanting the scoop on the evaporator change on a late or early 944
/924 drop me a line I've had to do both in the last 16 months.

Hope this helps.... I'm riding in A/C hope you will be soon also!
