I have this problem as well (89 944).  Without the AC on - moderate 70 
degree day, I will park the car for a short period (under an hour).  When 
I come back out and drive off, hot air comes out the vents, then it 
gradually cools to the outside temperature.  I mitigate it by turning on 
the AC for a short period, or by just opening the windows.

I think what is happening is the heater valve is opening in the engine 
compartment on startup for a short period, then closes.  Of course it 
takes a few minutes for the heater core inside the car to cool back down.

I'm not sure why this is happening, so if anyone can advise, great!  I am 
guessing there is misbehavior in the climate control unit itself, the 
vacuum solenoid behind the glovebox, or maybe a vacuum leak that causes 
the valve to open, then close when the engine starts and vacuum is restored.

I really don't want to wire the coolant valve shut for the summer like an 
old junky pickup truck.  ;-)

Gregor 89 944 2.7L.  A hot one.
