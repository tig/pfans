The response to my quiz (5/20) was not bad and one answer was close (by
Jay Jobes), so here it is again:

Too high of fuel pressure CAN cause a 944 not to start or die when
running.  The pressure regulator can from one moment to the next
malfunction and stop the return flow of fuel to the tank, causing
extremely high fuel pressure.  The engine will emit black smoke
momentarily and then die.  Upon cranking, if it does not start, you
usually get smoke coming out of the tailpipe.  

The quiz is...why will the engine die?...even when driving at high RPM
if the regulator goes out (at high RPM the engine could handle the extra
fuel caused by the high pressure)??  Sometimes the regulator can be
tapped on and the car will start.  The answer is NOT because it is
running too rich.  What causes the engine to die??... 

Another Quiz and tech tip...if your 944 won't start...what is one of the
first, and easiest, things to check...INJECTOR FIRE!! (which is
indicated by the light click..click sound made when cranking the
engine)!!  If the clicking is not heard (either audibly or with a
stethoscope or screwdriver held to your ear), unplug one of the
injectors and try to start the car again.  If the car starts up
(remember that it will run a little rough because one of the injectors
is unplugged), you have found your problem.  WHAT IS THE
REPAIR???...THAT IS WHAT THE QUIZ IS...

Remember, two free oil filters to the person who gets the first quiz
right, and I will give one free oil filter to the correct answer to the
second quiz. 

If you have already responded already, thanks, and the answer will be
forthcoming shortly.
