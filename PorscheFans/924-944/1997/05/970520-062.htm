Lets see.  I have a bill for that same repair that the PO had done in Feb
on this year.  Hold on I'm finding it!  OK, here it is.  $352.92  That
includes a slave cylinder $68.50 - a reverse light switch $25.00 - 3.0
hours labor for the cyl and 1.0 hours for the switch ($50/hr).  Ooops, it
also says $49.50 for the rollback to tow it in.  So if you deduct the
towing and reverse light switch it is still cost around $225.  Sounds like
you got a good deal to me.
