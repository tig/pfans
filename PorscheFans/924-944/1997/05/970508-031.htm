hey Clark,

You helped me get into the mess I'm currently in :) perhaps I can help with
your mess...

I just took the headers off my 1987 944 NA this past weekend... easier than
I thought and none of the bolts gave me any serious trouble... you have a
turbo, so your car may be different...

+ + +

here's my observations:

the exhaust is much more rigid than I would have thought, no real slack or
rubber grommet mounts or flex pipes...

I had to simply remove the bracket right in front of the catalytic
converter, this allowed the rear exhaust to hang a little, I
supported/lowered it with the scissor jack that came with the car... it
needs to hang since it's original position prevents the headers from coming
off... there really is no play, I'm surprised I have not heard more about
cracked exhaust parts... the O2 sensor wire had enough slack to hang with
the pipe w/o removal

if your removing the exhaust, just remove the exhaust and the headers
should come right off after you de-bolt them... I had no problem with the
head studs at all, they are still in the head and in good shape...

working mostly underneath, I needed a 3/8 universal joint and an extension
to get at two of the bolts, you also need to lodge a regular wrench on the
top bolt and use a socket on the lower nut... they both turn once loosened,
so I was not removing the nut until I stopped the bolt from turning...

they came right off with some light tugging... there was no gasket seal to
break like on the intake manifold... I admit I was surprised how well it
went, I remember the exhaust on my 1981 VW Scirocco drove me crazy with
those heat blasted rusty nuts and I think I screwed the studs up on that
car and had to replace them...

I am replacing all the nuts/bolts I took off to ensure I can get them off
in the future... the ones I took off have that "almost too beat to re-use"
look to them...
