I'm doing a 'frame-up' resto on my 77.5 924 special addition. A total jerk
in Florida drove it out of oil and now I have extra ventilation in the
block. I have a few questions.

1. Should I stick with an original (underpowered) 924 non-turbo replacement
engine for the sake of staying "true"? I wonder if it has value because it
is the first year of the first water-cooled, and all that. I would very
much like a tire squealer.

2. The engine (same as original) that I am thinking of buying off this guy
is ceased-up and he'll give me the whole car for $700. Am I doing good with
that?

3. Can a person find a rebuild kit (and other soft parts) for the above car
at a reasonable outlet, without paying $100 per o-ring from Automotion?

4. The car also needs...Interior, paint, carpet, tranny rebuild....am I
wasting my time and money?....Should I just look for a good 944 in the
mid-eighties and swallow the cash I've put into this beast?

Please help. I have an emotional aspect that is clouding my judgement. And
my wife will not allow a continuous flow of cash into it (yes, I'm
whipped).

Thanks in advance.
