Paul, the original post may or may not have said how much the owner
was planning to lower the car.  I do not remember.  I absolutely agree 
that there are lowered 944s racing, but IMSA dictates that they replace
the front control arms with the Fabcar arms (or something similar).  They
are not racing on the stock aluminum A-arms.  The original post said 
nothing about replacement of control arms, just of lowering the car via
spring and shock replacements, or at least that is how I read it.  IMSA,
Kelly-Moss and Porsche with its M030 put some research into this and
studied the dynamics and how the suspension geometry was changed from
lowering the car, I felt that is was necessary to relay these concerns to
the owner of the S2.  Some shops in town seems to prefer the adjustable
spring mount points so that they can lower the car without using shorter
springs and thus not altering suspension geometry, but I am not very 
familiar with this.  Is this not that the M030 option does anyway (or at
least I think I have seen it on some Ts)?

I am really not trying to flame anyone, I just happen to have seen a 944 
with a broken control arm, the wheel sort of took off in its own direction,
not pretty and the car had been lowered, so I thought I should raise some
  flags.
