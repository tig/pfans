Porschefans:

I plan to attend autocross school a week from Saturday followed by an
autocross on the next day (Sunday).  The event is run by the Akron Sports Car
Club, so I have no idea of there will be other Porsches there.  A few
questions before I go (and I'm sure I'll think of more between now and then):

1.  What tire pressures should I run in my 92 968 coupe?  It has Dunlop D40
M2 tires on standard 16" cup wheels, 205/55 in front and 225/50 rear.

2.  I need to bring some things with me including a cooler, a tire pump, etc.
 I assume that these things should be out of the car when I race.  Will there
be a place to put them?

3.  Should I make sure that the gas tank is only, say, a quarter full?  Or
will the lower weight be offset by the fuel pump having difficulty sucking
gas as it sloshes around?

4.  Is there any other specific preparation for the car before I autocross
it?  There will be a brief tech inspection at the track.

Thanks in advance!
