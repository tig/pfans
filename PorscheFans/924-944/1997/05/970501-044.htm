I have 88' Porsche 944 and I drive it daily. Recently (1 month ago) during
the rainy season I happen to drive my car through a puddle of water (may be
1 feet deep) approximately 30 feet.  Since then my acceleration got very
rough. I always use
supreme gasoline.  I tried Slick50 Fuel System and some other fuel ystems,
but it didn't work.  The gas pedal is very rough (as if something grinding
under my feet).

Is it possible that water went into any electrical parts (may be computer)
or any other
part of the engine which will result in rough accleration.  If someone
knows of a probable cure please let me know with details of the parts that
I may have to replace and where it is located under the hood. Thank you
very much.
