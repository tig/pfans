	Was there a posted warning, NO RADAR DETECTORS in VA as you passed 
the border?  If not, send a polite letter to the Court, politely 
telling them to get stuffed.  FCC regulations override state law by 
the way.  As a Ham Radio op I can have a police scanner in the car 
where it is illegal for others. I could have a radar detector in my 
car if I wanted, I could jam radar if I wanted (provided I am 
transmitting in a legal fashion), and there is NOT A THING the 
fuzzies can do about it.   You did not have to give your detector to 
the officer by the way, and you could have asked for a supervisor.  
Don't let these guys push you around when they are wrong!  You MUST 
NOT, ever give in to the government if you believe them to be wrong. 
 Read some of Robert Heinlein's books sometime.  Read Thomas 
Jefferson.
PS:  I am not militia or even right-wing. 

Send your  letter to the VA State Legislature and the Governor via 
email too.

Subject: Radar Detector Ticket in VA (long)


Hi All,

I had in interesting encounter yesterday while driving my Porsche 944
S2 in Hopewell, Virginia.  Mounted in the windshield was my Bel 745sti
radar detector.  It was turned off.   Not the best way to use a
detector, but I was leaving the city through an area with a lot of
construction and it was not even possible to drive at the speed limit.

Traffic narrowed down into one lane and slowed to 25-35 mph in a 45
mph zone.  I approached the slowed line of cars from the rear and
found myself behind a county police car.  After a few miles, the
officer partially turned into the median.  I thought he was going to
u-turn, but his lights briefly came on and I went past him.  At the
next light, I turned right.  He followed.  My next turn was going to
be a left. I signaled, moved into the left lane, then the turning
lane, and made my turn.  Officer Overkill (name changed to protect the
innocent) was in the right lane.  He immediately turned left from the
right lane accross the intersection using no signal or blue lights. 
He followed me for about 1/4 mile and switched on his lights and
siren.  I pulled over on a side road.

Officer Overkill stealthily creeps up behind Public Enemy Number One. 
I keep my hands on the wheel...

OO:     Sir, may I see your license and registration.
PONE:   Certainly.  (hands it to the preace officer)    
OO:     Sir, would you hand me the radar detector.
PONE    That unit was switched off.     
OO:     Radar detectors are illegal in the Commonwealth of Virgina.
PONE:   I don't recall a radar detector check service at the border. 
Was I supposed to throw it out the               window as I crossed
the state line?  I just turned it off. OO:     Please hand me the
detector, Sir.  It is illegal to have a power source accessable to the
driver that
        could power the detector.
PONE:   The unit was off.  Power supply is not the issue.  I was not
using the device. OO:     I'm not going to confiscate your detector,
Sir. PONE:   Wait while I write down the serial number. OO:     I'll
give it right back, Sir.

Officer Overkill is given the detector and heads back to the cruiser. 
5 munites later, he returns with the detector.  He hands that and a
ticket to the driver.

OO:     You may pay this in advance or contest it in court.  Please
sign here.  This is not an admission of            your guilt, only
that you have received the citation.           PONE:   It is pretty
obvious that I am guitly of _having_ a detector in my posession.   I'm
also in a car that         will go 149 mph, why don't you you issue me
a citation for speeding while you're at it? OO:     I don't write the
laws I just enforce them. PONE:   That makes me feel so much better.
OO:     Lock your detector in your glovebox, Sir. PONE:   You're
kidding me.  I promise I won't hurt myself or anyone else with it. OO:
    Have a nice day. PONE:   Whatever.

As I drive back out onto the road, I see a sign thanking me for
visiting Prince George County.  Yeah right.  A red sports car with
out-of-state tags and a flagrant disrespect for authority and domestic
tranquility was just too good to let the next county get!

I looked at this citation after returning home.  There is no fine
listed.  I must pay for a long distance call to  find out how much the
fine is.  It is not a moving violation and will not go on my driving
record.  What would this matter?  Detectors are not illegal in my home
state of NC.  I'm tempted to do nothing and let them extradite me to
VA for this crime against humanity.  At the very least, I'll write a
letter to the editor of the local Hopewell, VA paper.  Anybody got the
name?  I forgot to pick one up while I was in town.

Here's what I'm thinking:  Call collect to get the fine amount.  Send
them a COD package for the fine amount with the check inside. 
Probably won't get past step one, though.  Suggestions?  Legal advice?
