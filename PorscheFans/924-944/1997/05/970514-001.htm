Hi.
After owning my 83 924 for several months I decided to do a full service
last weekend, belts and all, The whole job was surprisingly easy except
getting the bolt that holds the alternator in place had been rounded by the
PO and required welding of a nut to the head to remove. Anyway the strange
thing that I found was there was no air filter in place, imagine the scene
go to your Porsche service kit get the new filter, go back to the car undo
the clips and what the f&^%, an empty air box, I have put the filter in and
the settings have now gone haywire, my question is, is this a mod somebody
would have done for performance, if so they have probably altered fuel
settings etc, should I take it to a Bosche centre to get it all reset or is
it something I can do myself? Haynes aren't very helpfull in this area.
Whilst I'm on the subject of fuel I have a minor problem when hot starting,
not as bad as some seem to have it but I have to crank the engine for a
couple of seconds before it fires, but when it's cold it fires straight
away, any ideas?
I also have a leak between the rear spoiler and the glass, I put some goo
in there and it slowwed down but I would like to stop it, is it possible to
remove the spoiler and clean up the whole area to get an effective seal?

Also there seems to be a few people from the UK on this list, I run a track
club primarily for bikes, but I organise a few car days a year, you don't
know how much fun tracking a vehicle is until you've tried.

p.s. this isn't a buisiness or anything I just do it for fun....:-)
