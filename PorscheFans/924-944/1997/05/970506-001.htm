A good choice would be the Haynes 944 Automotive Repair Manual.

Sure, I recently bought one for around Dfl. 49, ship me 55 guilders an I
will order one (and have it shipped to you). It's cheaper in the USA
though, I think around $15. Maybe some P-Fan over there is willing to ship
you one.

For the sake of your wallet;

Take good care when you buy a 944, ask for warranty, ask for maintenance
records, have it checked by a dealer.
I own a _very_ nice 944 but it has cost me a lot of money to get it in the
shape that I thought it was when I bought the car. Don't be misled by the
looks of the car you buy, make absolutely sure it's technically okay. Also
_study_ the 944 FAQ, especially the "first time buyers" section. I wish I
had. But if you have a good one, I can assure you it's a fantastic toy to
drive around in. It's fast, it handles great, it looks great. Big fun.


All the best,
