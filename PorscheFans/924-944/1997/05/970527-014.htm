In theory this sounds like a good idea, but in practice it might not. 
Personal news servers are a nice thing to have, but with security the way
it is today, may people (like myself) would not be able to connect to this
service because firewalls will block the traffic. 

Creating new groups in alt.* or rec.* would allow everyone to get this,
however that has it's drawbacks as well ... groups tend to splinter and
re-splinted, then before you know it there are so many groups people start
cross posting to everything because they don't know where to go.  And then
of course spamming is an issue as well .... The best (as in most
informative) news groups have always been "moderated" however those are a
pain to for the moderator to keep up with. 

I don't mean to stomp all over your idea .... a better way to get at all
this great Porsche information is definitely needed.  I get the digest for
the "general" and "924-944"  groups, and it's just a big confusing lump
for me (I get like a 100k digest daily!). I think the Proschefans server
should do something better with its archive service ... something like use
Hypermail and/or glimpse to provide per-month threaded archive access with
searching.  If the owners of the server can't do this, then it would
certainly be possible to subscribe an automated service to all the lists
would could get digested messages, explode them, and do all sorts of
organizations with the messages and present them on a web page (being a
Unix SA, I could certainly help with this if people are interested).
