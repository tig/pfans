I am hoping that someone can help me interpret the results of a
compression test recently performed on my 944.

The car is smoking occasionally on full throttle acceleration in second
gear. This only happens after holding a constant speed at about 3000 rpm
for several (10-20) seconds then flooring it in second.  Enough smoke is
generated to see it clearly in the mirror. Under normal conditions,
accelerating through the gears under full throttle this does not happen.
Suspecting worn rings and cylinders I performed a compression test, the
results are as follows:

cyl #1 164 dry 170 wet
cyl #2 170 dry 182 wet
cyl #3 162 dry 178 wet
cyl #4 162 dry 185 wet

These are all well above the specifiewd minimum of 145 psi which I
suppose is the good news. But I am not sure whether the increase between
wet and dry is within acceptable limits. I suppose that a leak down test
is in order, I would appreciate if anyone could give some specific
instructions and spec's for this test.

Assuming that all is ok with the rings, does anyone have any other ideas
what could be the problem?  I was thinking that maybe the crankcase
ventilation system was acting up somehow but I could not find any info
on it in the factory manual or the Haynes manual. I know that the Oxygen
sensor is way beyond its recommended service life, could this problem be
caused by a bad signal from the oxygen sensor?

Any and all help would be appreciated.
