1.  remove door panels.
2. get haynes manual.
3.  take the door handle out completely (pain in the ass)
4.  There is a white plastic piece that dangles from the trigger, unscrew it 2-3 
turns.  this makes the reach of the trigger longer and there you have it.  the 
haynes manual is very helpful with pictures, this is not a 5 minute job more 
like 30+ mins. per side easily.
5.  lube it all and put it back together.
6.  before i could barely open it now my 3 yr old niece can pull the trigger, 
per se.

it really makes sense when you see the white piece, it just doesnt push the 
lever down far enough so thusly it is very hard to open, the longer the reach 
the easier the door opens.

disclosures:
this is a pain in the ass.
make sure the window is *UP* BEFORE you start or you will have to reconnect the 
wiring harnesses.
this will take at least 1/2 hour per side because of the door panel removal but 
is well worth the time.
the WD-40 bit DOES NOT work as some people have suggested eventually with the 
change in temperature the WD-40 becomes more harmful than helpful.
good luck and keep your patience!!!!!!!!!!
