Hi, Steve,

I have generally found the early 944 speedometers to be fairly accurate
(within about 5 percent plus or minus) throughout the indicated range.

The best way to check the accuracy is to find an interstate with measured
miles indicated and use a stopwatch to help calculate your true speed,
while trying to hold an indicated speed (e.g. one mile at 60 mph should
click off in 60 seconds, one mile at 90 mph should click off at 45 seconds,
one mile at 120 mph should take 30 seconds).

Strangely enough, I have never received a speeding ticket in my red 944, 
but have my fair share in other lesser vehicles... (not that I am a more
conservative driver in the 944.)


Good Luck!
