Mornin' all,

I have just about got all of the glitches taken care of on my '82 924.  For
those of you who suggested a Weber big throat, thanks, it really woke up the
motor.

Today's delema.  After a couple of hours driving around town in the heat, my
fuel guage starts to drop.  I have verified that it has about a quarter of a
tank, but reads almost empty.  After letting the car stand for an hour or
two, it reads fine. 

It is probally a grounding issue, and I have already fixed the ground at the
sender, but does anyone know where the ground wire actually grounds once it
enters the loom?  I can't seem to find the correct ground spot.

Next, for those of you with high milage Porsche's, what motor oil have you
ran to give you such long life?  I am absolutely anal about maintenance on
my cars and am a firm believer in high quality oils.  But, I also feel that
different oils work better in different cars.  In my '88 Ford Bronco with
the 4.9 I6, I run Chevron Delo 400 15w-40.  It is designed for commercial
rigs and is very good, but my Bronco wont rev past 4k either.  So, I just
want to hear suggestions on the matter.

Thanks 

Jay
