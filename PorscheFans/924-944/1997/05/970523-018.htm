Answer (which are derived from an 86')
1. 4x6 
2. 4x6 is the max with no mods.
3. Sound messy. It really isn't that hard to remove the windows and do the job the right way. If it really scares you a good car stereo shop shouldn't charge much more than a couple or hours to do it for you.
 I also think that it may be possible to do the job with out removing the window. You will need a really short screw driver to unscrew the speakers while bending the interior panel a little. (Need to remove all panel screws, obviously) When I did mine I removed the window but I think in retrospect that you may be able to do it this way without damage.
