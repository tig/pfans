Have you been driving the car for some time, or is this your first turbocharged
car?  It's common for most people when they have driven my past cars to wonder
how the car is so quick when they get in, floor it and nothing happens.
They then let off and go away thinking what a piece of junk I drive and how
his Yugo could blow the doors off it.

My favourite turbo lag story was last year in my Talon AWD.  If you think
the 951(S) has lag, you should have felt my Talon.  The little 2.0L motor
with 7.8:1 compression had no power at all until the turbo came in and
it would come with a furious rage.  I lent my car out to the Novice Program
Co-ordinator at an event.  He was doing quite well, which is unusual when
you put a NA guy into a Turbo car.  He then went into the tight bend, planted
the throttle, nothing happens, nothing happens, then WHAMO, boost comes in
and shoots him into the fence and over a concrete block, all the while I
was videotaping the run :(  The car had $10,000 in damage which he paid 
being the gentleman and well-respected person that he was.  Needless to
say, I'm very cautious who drives my turbo cars now :)

I think Wes (S2 guy) was one of the people that helped pull the car off the
concrete block!
