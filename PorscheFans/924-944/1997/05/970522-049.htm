One other item I didn't see mentioned is that there are two solenoid valves
which control the flow of vacuum to the HVAC system, including the water
shutoff in the engine bay.  Being that these two valves are just about the
only moving parts, I suspect them as being the culprits, at least in my
car.  I took the lower one apart (the one which controls the hot water
shutoff) and cleaned it and greased it (lithium grease), but it didn't
completely fix the problem.  I was able to observe that if I turned to full
hot, waited, and then full cold a couple of times that I could get it to
stay on cold.  To me this spells failing solenoid valve.  You might swap
the two of them (they're identical) and see if anything changes in your
system.  If it does, you've got an answer.  Let us know what you find.

Also, you or I might have the vacuum hoses reversed on that lower solenoid
since our cars exhibit the exact opposite phenomenon.
