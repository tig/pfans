1) Maybe someone has experienced this and can lend some insight as to how 
to fix the problem.  I have a 1980 924, and after a day of heavy rain I 
can hear water sloshing around behind the dash board.  If I make a heavy 
turn I am libel to get a decent amount of water dumped on my feet.  Any 
idea as to how to get the water to drain properly, where the hole may be?

2) As well, any insight as to the complexity to changing the rear drum 
breaks and emergency brake cable?  Is it as easy as take off the old 
parts and put the new parts on in reverse order?  Any special tools 
needed?  What tools should I have.

3) My front defroster doesn't blow air with enough force.  Connecticut 
Inspection will not pass until the front defroster blows a piece of 
paper!  There is some air coming out of the vents now.  Any ideas on 
where the problem may be?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
