Hey everyone,

Where I live (suburban Maryland) 80mph is really no big deal, people still
pass me all the time. Sometimes it strikes me as a little unsafe, since the
roads are so populous, but I've never felt like I was in danger in this 
car.
The 944 has the brakes (and I've needed them) and handling covered. The 
real
danger is when I switch over to my girlfriend's Probe. I have to remind my-
self that I won't stop right away in that car. I've forgotten a few times,
and had a few very close calls.

Of course, when I say 80 is no big deal, I mean 80 "Porsche speedometer"
miles per hour. Who knows how fast that is in real life. One thing is for
sure, the car feels just as stable to me at 100 as it does at 70. It's the
people in the other cars you have to worry about. I think you'd have to be
pretty careless to lose it.
