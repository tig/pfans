Hmm.. It seems my time of posting was a bit awkward, since many of you seems
to think I want to mount a 968 wing. I'm actually just trying to get a
normal rubber 924 turbo spoiler on my spoilerless 924 hatch, but it seems to
be more work than I thought it would be.. Many have told me that the 924 and
944 hatches (or frames) are different. Is this true? If so, in what way?

The hatch on the 924 I checked out looked identical to mine. The only
problem was that the screws seemed to go through the glass. If you look at
the underside of the hatch frame you will see that there is one thick
portion (where the glass presumably is) and a thin portion where there
cannot possibly be any glass.

The screws went through the thick portion of the frame, as I guess they do
on the 944? Anyone care to open their hatch and check? You don't have to
take off the spoiler to see where the screws go. My question to any of you
who have had the spoiler off your car - do the screws indeed go through the
glass, or are portions of the glass cut away on these frames?

If it goes through the glass, the holes must have been drilled before
dipping in the strengthening stuff Anders mentioned, so it would have to be
done by Sekurit and not by Porsche. The frame itself doesn't seem any
different, so either there is no glass in the thick portion of the frame, or
there are predrilled holes in the glass.

Can anyone enlighten me? I have seen so many 924s with both Turbo spoilers
and 944 spoilers, and I very much doubt all of these have bought new (or
used) hatches! I hope the magic word is not glue..

Perhaps I should just take out the sledge-hammer and get insurance to pay
for a brand new hatch w/spoiler.. :)
