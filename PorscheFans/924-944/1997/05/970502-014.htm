Hi P-fans,

First my question...

Well, it seems my idle stabilizer is in need of replacement. Since I 
bought the car it has always had a slightly erratic idle (constantly 
cycles from 8-900 rpm), but until recently began to stumble on 
deceleration. Even after revving the engine while parked the needle 
would drop to 4-600 as if ready to stall then would climb back up and 
begin to cycle again.
I seem to remember someone having done this recently (Steve 
Gomberg...was that you?). This would be my first attempt at working on 
my car and since I am definitely not mechanically inclined, any 
outlines, tool list, part list, suggestions would be greatly 
appreciated.

Second...

Barry...glad to hear you had a great time at Lime Rock. I saw your P-car 
at Bill's getting ready for Club Racing...looks like one tough machine. 
Go get them!

Third...

Jim Richmond...fantastic commentary!!! I thoroughly enjoy all your 
stories and am glad to hear the beast lives. We hear so often how the 
turbo cars can be modified, but with the exception of a chip and a K&N 
filter, so few of us actually do. As one listmember said, keep the 
stories coming!

By the way Jim, did the new brain absolutely solve your cut out problem? 
I have not had the time or money (seems my wallets been busy with other 
repairs) to track this one down, but would definitely replace mine if 
that will solve my cutout problem.

Thanks
