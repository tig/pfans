As much as I hate an argument about insurance, I must add my two cents.
I am currently employed as an insurance claims adjuster and even though
your policy may read slightly different than what I am about to say, all
personal auto policies have an exclusion similar to this:

        EXCLUSIONS: . . . 
        
        . . .loss to any (sic) YOUR COVERED AUTO or NON-OWNED AUTO
while        it
is being used in any organized or professional race or  similar
function.  . . .

While Autocrossing is not a race per se, but a race against time, you
still have risk that is not underwritten in a personal auto policy.  It
is not the intent of a personal auto policy to cover you for this event.

If you were to have a claim and you told the adjuster that it happened
at a PCA event, or even at a non organinzed event (you and a friend set
up cones and did it) you would be told that any damage that occured
during the event would not be covered.
