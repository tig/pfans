I believe in the saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Well,
that may hold true for a '65 Datsun or '66 Pontiac, but I keep reading
horror stories of failed 944 water pumps and the resulting damage.
    I have an '88 944NA with 67,000 miles, the maintenance records
indicate that the pump has never been changed.  A few months ago I
changed the timing/balance shaft belts, as well as replaced all the
clutch components.  I broke down and purchased the special "tool" so I
perform the work myself.
    It's time for the 1500 mile belt tension check and I was wondering
if I should replace the water pump?  It's dry as a bone, the car doesn't
overheat and otherwise runs great.  But, I know pumps can go at anytime.
Do you see the dilemma?  Also, should I decide to change, are the
rebuilt pumps from Automotion, etc... reliable? Or should I spend a
little more and purchase new?  Does anyone have experience with the
rebuilt pumps?
    Also, while I have the front of the engine off, should I change all
the front engine seals, including the dreaded oil cooler seals?  Any
input would be greatly appreciated.  Aloha, Al
