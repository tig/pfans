I sent an email to R&S Racing a few days back inquiring about some Hoosier
race tires and am astonished to find the prices he has on his web site are
correct.  Hoosier is apparently changing the compound and construction of
the A3S02 tire for next year and wants to clear the old stock out.  These
are a fantastic auto-x tire, but they wear very quickly, but at these
prices, who cares!

You can reach them at rvermulm@netins.net or call Ron at (888)261-1243 US.
I have no affiliation besides now being a 6 tire customer :)

I've grabbed these tires sizes off their web site, which is located at:
http://www.rsracing.com

Model	Size		Comp	Price
45600	P225/50ZR-16	A3S02	$85.00
45610	P245/45ZR-16	A3S02	$85.00
45621	P255/50ZR-16	A3S02	$85.00
45630	P275/45ZR-16	A3S02	$85.00
45700	P245/40ZR-17	A3S02	$85.00
45710	P255/45ZR-17	A3S02	$85.00

I purchased (4) 225/50R16 and (2) 245/45R16.  The Hoosiers are really wide
so be careful about going too wide, they may rub or cause other problems.
These work great on factory stock wheels for the 951 (7's and 9's or 7.5's
and 9's on the later cars).  They also have some 15" sizes that may work on
the NA 944s (see, I do care about the NA guys too :) :) )

And, I just wanted to mention that the chip discussion we had was fantastic,
even the dorrito ones.  I think the group came out ahead after all the
excellent topics Anders and the others brought up.  I'm going to try and 
incorporate some of the emails into an article I've been asked to write for
my local PCA newsletter.  All credit will be given appropriately of course.

It's gorgeous out here in B.C. today, 20C outside, clear blue sky, tall mountains
showing.  I'm gonna go mountain driving tommorow!

Have a nice weekend all!
Farzaan.
