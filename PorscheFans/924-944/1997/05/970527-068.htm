I took apart my brake assembly on my front right wheel today.  Nothing was
really wrong, just wanted to see how everything worked, and to see if I could
diagnose my camber problem.


I was amazed how much easier it is to do on the '89 951 than it was to do on
the '84 944.  The caliper is not part of the hub anymore.  Two allen bolts, two
screws, and bingo you have your caliper and rotor off.


Anyway, back to my question.  Where do I measure piston diameter?  I took a
rubbing of the two pistons in the front caliper.  Which gave me an inner and
outer etch.  I measured the diameter (of outer etch) and came up with something
40mm and 30mm. (big piston and small piston)  The specs say my car should have
44mm and 36 mm pistons.  There were no 40mm and 30mm specs listed for any of
the 944 cars.

Any clues?  Or am I not measuring the pistons correctly (I took the outer edge
of the rubbing).

Thanks!
