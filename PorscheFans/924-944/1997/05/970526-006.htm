I have some clear, slightly slippery fluid leaking from the somewhere 
under the engine compartment.  I cannot locate the source.  It does 
not look like oil or power steering fluid.  About a two months ago I 
saw a large puddle of the fluid and looked for the source, could not 
find it.  Up until last week this "puddle" did not reoccur, now it has 
happened again.  Any clues?


Also: it is time for all my belts to be changed, including the timing 
belt.  Can anyone give me an estimate on a reasonable cost from a 
garage on doing this?  Should I have the water pump changed even 
though I do not see any problems with it?  I bought this car last year 
and it now has 75K on it and runs great!

Thanks,

Gary
