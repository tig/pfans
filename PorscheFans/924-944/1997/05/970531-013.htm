  I have repaired  a number of 924 speedometers with the condition you have
described.  It is not to hard to do.  First you must remove the ring that
holds the bezel (glass) on the speedo.  You do this from the back by GENTLY
prying the ring away from the housing.  I use a flat blade screw driver for
this.  Go slowly and work your way around the speedo untill you have
loosened the ring sufficently to remove it.  Next remove the plastic lens. 
Now remove the two screws from the housing back and work the speedo unit
from the housing.  The problem may be a broken gear but most often the gear
just slips out of place. I usually remove the gear from the shaft and place
small washers on the shaft to prevent it from slipping back again.  You can
then use a little glue if you wish but be carefull none drips into the
unit. Before reassembly turn the drive counterclockwise to make shure
everything works.  Put everything back and replace the ring bending it back
in place to hold in the glass.  If you get ambitious some of the rings
holding in the glass are brass painted black.  I have used a Dremil tool
with a wire brush to remove the paint and polish the brass.  Then spray it
with a clear paint to protect it.  Looks nice when done but to do it right
you have to do the tach and instrument cluster also.  Hope this helps but
if you get really desperate I have a working 80 mph speedo around here
somewhere I can part with.
