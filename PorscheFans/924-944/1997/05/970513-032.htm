Fellow PorscheFans,

Just wanted to thank EVERYONE for their advice, thoughts, and comments they 
have given me on the subject of whether or not to chip.  I really appreciate
it, even if I did not respond to you personally, I am very greatful for the
information and many different opinions and schools of thought.

Once I am able to perform more work on my car myself without having to run to
a dealer everytime something goes wrong, I'll probably go ahead with updating
the chip.

I liked Anders advice about first getting the car in its stock form up to its
fullest potential mechanically before doing any aftermarket mods to it.  It
seems logical to start with a totally "clean bill of health".

Thanks again everybody.
