To follow up on the thread about R12, today I took my wife's Volvo with a
dead A/C to the shop.  Stan, the air conditioning man, charged me $100 to
repair the broken aluminum suction line and replace all the o'rings, $50 to
evacuate and recharge, $50 to convert to 134A and $39.60 for the R134A. 
Grand total of $239.60 for complete conversion to 134A.  It blows as cold
as before.

When I asked Stan about converting a Porsche he rolled his eyes back and
mumbled something about not working on German race cars.  When I told him
the A/C was made in Japan, he replied "All the more reason".  Seems Stan
has been burned in the past and does not want to try untested ground.  My
attitude is if they can do a Volvo, they should be able to convert a
Porsche.

Anyone else had any luck?
