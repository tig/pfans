We may never know whether it has made any difference or not, but I'm
convinced that it didn't, especially considering that all that work was
done without fixing the problem.

When you push-start a car, you don't need a lot of speed at the rear wheels
to get over the 200RPM at the flywheel, due to the gearing and
differential.  When my car had this trouble, I would sometimes drop the
clutch too soon and the engine would *not* fire.  I had to push just a
little faster.  I'm uncertain as to how you can know that you weren't at
200RPM or more.  The other difference, of course, is that when you dump the
clutch, it's possible to get a different sort of velocity curve than with
the starter.  That is, the RPMs can come up much more quickly than with the
starter and produce a spike just over the minimum RPM.

Regardless, this is only my observation combined with the info from that
book.  I have not yet seen any Porsche documentation on the subject, but I
would sure like to!  All the rest of what we've been discussing really
falls into conjecture.

I don't believe that it does sense oil pressure because my oil-pressure
valve stuck full open and blew out the side of the oil filter.  Oil
pressure dropped to the "1" bar yet continued to idle until I shut it down.
And it even restarted.  Maybe this info will be useful someday further on.
