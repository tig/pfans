Hey guys,

What happened to that fellow that was building the killer 951?  I can't
remember his name at this time, but he was giving us reports of the
build-up and had some oiling problems (blew out on track or something).
Did this get fixed?  What was the condition of the car after the small
fire?  What is the next step and is it ready to go again???  I've been
reading those posts with great interest to hopefully save me time
and money in the future.

An all-out race car maybe here in the near future and I want to gather
as much data about building these up now before I make any wrong decisions.

In case you still don't remember the posts, the fellow was referring
to his mechanic as the "master".

Farzaan.
