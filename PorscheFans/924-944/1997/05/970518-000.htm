We all may have that gut feeling that our engines should not be lugged
(excessively loaded at low RPM's). Here is some of the reasons:

We know that the combustion takes as long wether driving slow or fast,
hence the need for advanced timing at high RPM's. In this case we'll see
the combustion speed as slow, and want it to get a head start to the
piston.

The combustion will be as fast (or slow) at low speeds and will not
expand (not explode...) over sufficient travel at low RPM. At very slow
combustion pressure release (low piston velocity, much, lower than the
combustion flame front speed, pinging (knocking) occurs. This may be
because the restrained combustion process itself is changing the
compression ratios for unignited gas in the combustion chamber.

Then, we have the added problem with bearings taking up load and
depending on oil pressure and oil film to do so. There is a very real
possibility that at low RPM the oil pressure will be to low to maintain
a unbroken oil film on the rod bearings if the engine is asked to take a
too big load at low RPM's, especially cold.
