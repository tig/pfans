Lift

To the lucky devil who is building a garage with a lift, you might want t=
o
look at Backyard Buddy lifts.  When I was considering building my own, I
obtained their literature from the Net for ideas.  Here in SoCal used abo=
ve
ground double post lifts sell for around $2000 up and usually leak.  I
think theirs ran between $3,000 to $4,500 delivered in the U.S..  My idea=
s
for a frame with 4 Hi-lift jacks or a frame to be lifted by forklift are
still on the drawing board.

Waterpumps

I bit the bullet and bought a new waterpump from one of the mail order
places for $186 rather than go for the $100 rebuild and have to return a
core.

Nitrous

The drag strip boys says there are fail safe controllers for NOS now.  Me=
lt
down is a thing of the past with the new computer controllers according t=
o
them.  Anyone willing to strap a NOS bottle and a Jacobs Mastermind on
their P car to do some testing?  Is the list member who was considering i=
t
still with us or is he picking exploded exhaust pipe out of his butt?
