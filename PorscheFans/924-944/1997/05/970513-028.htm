Thanks to all who responded to my post a short time ago requesting help
on my 924's brakes, which have a lot of legroom before the pedal hits
the brakes. The common thread was that the rear drums were probably out
of adjustment.

I was able to confirm both that my brake booster is still good, and that
the adjusters are the problem: they're rusted solid! So, that puts me in
the position of having to try to find replacements. I've been
unsuccessful in looking through the Performance Parts and Automotion
catalogs. Does anyone know of another source? Mail-order? Could I likely
find this at a dealership? Is this a common VW/AUDI/PORSCH part?

TIA...
