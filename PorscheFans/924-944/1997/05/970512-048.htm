Hello all,

I was driving home from work the other day when I noticed a black '87 944S
for sale.  The car looks better than my '95 Mitsu Eclipse (don't laugh) as
far as dings and scratches go.  The only noticeable interior flaw is that
the clips for the driver and passenger side sunvisors have broken.  The car
has 113054 miles on it and the owner (2nd owner) has had it for the last 5
yr. and is asking $7000.  I know that I can get the clips for around 6-7
bucks a piece.  The car has 15 inch telephone dials and a good set of
tires.  I have not been able to drive the car as of yet.  I know that will
be the main factor.  The owner said something about belts squealing when
you first crank it but that it straightens itself out after a little while.
 He said he would fix this.  What I want to is does this sound like a good
deal?  I hope to talk him down about $500-$1000.  Are these cars expensive
to maintain?  What could go wrong?  What should I look for as far as
mechanical and body condition?  What does the S designation mean?  I have
never owned one of these cars but have had the bug for over a year and a
half.  I've got a subscription to excellence and also receive automotion
and Perf. Prod. catalogs so I know a little (very little).  Any help would
be appreciated.
