Hello all,

I would like to make a few (very few) comments to the 944 list.

First off, anyone who has taken the time to READ Farzaan's posts
would quickly realize that he knows what he is talking about. 

Second, if you have a problem with a post from some one, that's fine.
If you want to debate them in public, that's fine too. But there is
no excuse to insult someone, and use profanity in a subject line! 

Regarding VERY USEFUL posts from Frazaan, here are some that I've saved:

Subject: Fuel Pressure Regulator.

I installed a higher output 3.0 bar fuel pressure regulator on the rear
most regulator with good results.  It helps the mid and bottom end
torque noticeably, but it reduces the top end slightly.  My assumption
is that the bottom and mid range are quite lean in the factory programming,
but the top end is fatter (or richer if you prefer) so the FPR makes

The swap took 15 minutes and is worth it.  There is one caution and this
is the reason why I put the stock one back in.  If the mixture gets too
rich under WOT, the cat convertor can become clogged which is a bad,
expensive thing to do.  Until I get my EGT gauge in, I am going to leave

Subject: Anti-Lag System

I like it when you guys bring up topics I have experience in!  Many have
replied about the anti-lag system and some are close, but not totally
correct.  Here are the different parts mentioned in previous posts and
their actual duties:

Pop Off Valve:
A pop off valve bleeds intake air pressure to atmosphere to control
boost.  This is what is used on Indy cars to prevent a team from 
cheating.  You can set the pop off valve at 1 bar of boost.  The turbo
can pump out 1.5 bar or whatever;  as soon as it gets to the pop

Compressor Bypass Valve:
This valve is that whoosh you hear on the rally cars when they get off
the throttle.  This is the valve that goes between the compressor and
the throttle body.  When you let off, it releases the air pulses into
atmosphere.  This device is only supposed to open under vacuum, not boost,

For turbocharged cars, tuners usually like to run the car at 12:1 at
WOT.  13:1 is probably where the power peak rests at WOT, but it's 
likely getting too close to detonation for comfort.  Under part throttle
or normal driving or even under moderate boost, 14.7:1 is what the
oxy sensor should be dialing the mixture to.  When I used to drag race

Subject: Chips

While the car was at the shop, the service manager and I decided to do
some testing.  We slapped on an aftermarket boost gauge from Autometer
and went testing.  We had three chipsets to test.

1. Autothority (really old chips)
2. Autothority (version 2.7 latest)
3. Andial turbo cup computers (purchased from AJ-USA who purchased from
   Andial back in 1988)  Cost for these were US$1000!

I'll give you the impressions I got from each one:
[descriptions deleted]

I could easily go on. The point I'm trying to make is that I don't 
seem to have saved any posts from jplee. I have saved many informative
posts from people like: George B, Doug Donsback, Jim Pasha, Tony Staples,
Greg Brown, Jim Richmond, Ted Smith, Mike Mitchel, Marv DeBeque, Randy
Hubbard, Andy Warren, Jason Burkett, and many, many others (if you're
a frequent poster, and I missed you, I apologize, it doesn't mean I
don't value your posts, I'm just getting tired of typing).

I wonder why I haven't saved any of jplee's posts?
