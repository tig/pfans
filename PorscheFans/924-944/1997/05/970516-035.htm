Everyone around here always bugs me about the weird tyre size or different
brands I run front and rear on the STREET. For racing I run all 4 the same
brand and whatever is the fastest combination. But for the street I and
others on the autocross list have talked before about NOT getting the most
expensive high tech tyres. My idea is to get the lowest overall diameter
tyre I can find to improve my final drive ratio. On the street I get many
more opportunitities to accelerate than to drive corners safely at the
limit of the tyres. With a lesser tyre the cornering speeds can drop to
apoint where you can safely drift the rear end. If I were you and wanted
to be adventurous I would try 195/45 or 205/50 x15 sizes in the rear. My
wheels are 16" so I'm thinking of trying 225/40x16! Then I can hear the
beautiful engine sounds more with my B&B muffler. YMMV literally and no
flames please.
