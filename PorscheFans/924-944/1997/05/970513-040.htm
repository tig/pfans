Hello,

During acceleration (moderate through full throttle), my A/C or A/C fan   
seems to slows to a speed about equal to 1 on the dial.  As soon as I   
resume a crusing speed or slow to minimal throttle the A/C blows with the   
correct force again.  I called the dealer this morning and he seemed to   
think something was definitely wrong.  I know I do have some sort of   
loose belt around 1500-2000 rpm.  Has anyone had this type of problem?   
 Is it possible that they are related in any way.
