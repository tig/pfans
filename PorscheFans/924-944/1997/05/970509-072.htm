As anybody installed an aftermarket front spoiler for a NA 944 like the
ones from Tweeks or Auto Atlanta?? I have one that is cracked in a
couple of places and was poorly painted by a previous owner and it needs
replacing. Are there any alternatives to this spoiler that doesn't cost
a thousand bucks?  Also, has anybody had a problem with the factory
alarm that stopped working and was able to get it to operate again? I
have one that doesn't work and I don't have a clue has to what to look
for to get it operable again. Thanks!   									Jeff
