Hello again,

I don't know why I'm telling you guys this, but maybe it'll save
someone else a little frustration and a few grey hairs. Ok, you
may remember a while back I posted about a rough idle that was
intermittently plauge-ing my car. The first time it happened was
the day I brought it back from the dealer after having the belts
retensioned. The thing was so rough I couldn't believe it, and it
fixed itself in about 2 minutes. I immediately thought "damn that
dealer to hell" but couldn't come up with any reason or proof. It
happened a few more times over about a month, and I was beginning
to think something was seriously wrong. As is customary, I could
not produce this for my mechanic. Did I mention it was really
rough?

So, last Sunday, a friend and I were driving through Virginia. I
stopped to get gas, and when I restarted the problem was present.
I was almost happy when my friend acknowledged the bad idle (as
my girlfriend was clueless on previous occasions), and drove off
expecting fully for it to go back to normal. It didn't. The idle
manifested itself as a "noisy" loss of power with the car under
load, especially at low rpms. My first clue came when Dave Cooley
off-handedly referred to my original posting as a "three cylinder
idle" (thanks Dave!). It was exactly like when a plug wire opened
up on my 924. But the problem never lasted long enough to warrant
a big inspection. Anyway, this time I was able to figure it out.
I first checked all the plug wires and noticed that removing #3
made no difference. The wires are brand new and all were plugged
in as far as possible. To the injectors I went. As soon as I
touched #3 injector the idle came up. It turns out that when I
replaced the injectors a while ago, the plug didn't quite get
engaged all the way (pause for laughter). I really hate those
stupid connectors!

I guess my post could have been shortened by just saying:

"Hey everybody, go make sure your injectors are plugged in!"

But the important lesson is to be as careful as possible when
doing anything to your car, and don't rush through it. I was
burning daylight when I did this job, and it bit me in the ass.
Now I have to worry about if any damage was done while driving
around with a spark plug firing in an empty combustion chamber.
Talk about your lean mixtures!

Thanks for listening,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
