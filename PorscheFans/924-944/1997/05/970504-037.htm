Dear gang:

     Has anyone out there ever had a coil fail in a late 944. The subject is
a '87 944 and was running fine in the middle of a long weekend trip, then I
stopped for gas and the car would not restart. I had the car trailered to
friend of mine in the area, to inspect/troubleshoot the next morning. Next
morning I went out and just for grins car fired off, so I warmed car up to
norm temp and shut it down. It would not restart. I put timing light on coil
wire and determined no spark situation. Checked primary voltage to coil from
control unit, and it is approx 8v. Checked secondary and it is less than 1v.
Checking primary resistance of coil (pole 15 to pole 1) I get .7ohms.
 Checking secondary (pole 4, hidden by rubber plug, with pole 1) I get an
open circuit reading from multitester. Am I correct in these test procedures?


I don't have my manual with me so if any one has these numbers fresh in their
mind, or has experience/helpful hints for more involved troubleshootingI
would appreciate it.
