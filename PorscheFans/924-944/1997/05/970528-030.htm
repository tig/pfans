Greetings fellow waterpumpers:

The lifters in my '88 924S have been noisy for some time, but performance is
not hampered.  I've tried the oil additives specifically for noisy lifters,
and they do nothing.  The lifters quiet themselves after the engine gets
really hot.  I'm not too concerned about it, but it is time for an oil
change, and I am thinking of two options I would like  opinions on.  The
first is to switch to a good synthetic, like Mobil 1.  I have not used a
synthetic for 10 years, but remember that when I used it in my scirroco, it
seemed to really clean up the inside of the engine (very noticable during
valve adjustments).  I'm wondering if that might also ungunk some of my
lifters.  But, I am a little afraid of increased leaks from old seals (any
truth to that?).  The other option I'm considering is regular dyno oil, with
some Slik 50, or some other teflon additive.

The car is not a daily driver, and I'm wondering if just the regular dyno oil
might be gunking when the car often sits for a couple days at a time.  Any
thoughts?
