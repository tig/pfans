I have just subscribed to this list (my girlfriend is taking delivery of a 
95 968 Cab tonight), and read Mark Wollner's post on car care with great 
interest.  Mark, I have a question or two for you if you don't mind.

I recently detailed my car (black) using 3M's Imperial Hand Glaze followed 
by Zymol wax.  The Imperial HG produced a wonderful, deep shine; it didn't 
do a whole lot to remove the swirl marks I had.  I then tried Perfect It 
Glaze on one panel, and that seemed to do a slightly better job on the 
marks.  I've heard that the Imperial HG is totally non-abrasive, and is 
primarily meant for show cars to produce that really deep shine, when you 
won't be waxing over it.  The Perfect-It is what I should be using to 
remove swirl marks, and polish before I apply the wax.  Would this be your 
recommendation too?

What, exactly, is the difference between Perfect-It and Imperial Hand 
Glaze?  Is the recommended application method (by hand, very light coat, 
let sit for a minute before buffing) essentially the same for both 
products?

I didn't notice much streaking with the wax over the Imperial Hand Glaze - 
just a little on the hood that I was able to remove with quite a bit of 
elbow grease.  Someone else who tried the same product combination on a 
similar car got significantly more streaking.

I'd used Zymol's HD Cleanse followed by their wax in the past; I thought 
the Imperial Hand Glaze/Perfect-It followed by the same wax produced a 
better shine.  I think I will be using Perfect-It (by hand only) in the 
future.
