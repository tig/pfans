Now, there is no such thing as a reliable life expectancy number for a
*single* waterpump. While there may be statistics available for the MTBF
(mean time between failure - commonly used term in computerese) for 944
waterpumps, no one can tell when one particular pump is going to break
down. If a sensible mean life lenghth is 60 K miles, that will probably
also mean that a few pumps will break at 20 K, some may make it to 180
K. There is even a (slight) risk, that you are changing a 'good' pump,
with 50 K miles left in it, for a 'bad' pump that will break after 30
K... 

On my car, the pump broke down at over 100 K miles (193000 km) and 10
years. Then, it started to leak, slowly but consistent, and there was
ample time to order a new pump and change it.    

I vote for "wait and see".
