Greetings from Kingston, Ontario. I have a 1987 944/924s cylinder head
that was completely rebuilt through Porsche in Ottawa last October. There
are less than 500 km on the head, and the cam assembly/cover is included.
I have all reciepts from Porsche, and a warranty still exists on their
work. I bought an 87 924S from someone who had neglected to change their
timing belt at 90+k. With the money I saved in buying the car as is, I had
the head rebuilt. Unfortunately (very), my new car didn't make it back
from it's very first two hour trip, as I spun a bearing. Apparently the
compression on top was putting abnormal strain on the crank. It was one of
my low points in life thus far. 
	However, a couple of months later, Santa brought me a long-block
in excellent condition of the same vintage. 

Moral: If a car doesn't run when you buy it, offer them half of what
they're asking, or walk away.

 Selling price: $2500.00 Cdn. (all OEM replacement parts on head)

I also have the shortblock as is for parts (make offer).

Please contact me for more information via email or telephone.

Also, does anyone have any information on stone guards for 'P-bodies', as
in, are they ugly?, and if not, where do I get them?, $$$?
