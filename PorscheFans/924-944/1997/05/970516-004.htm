Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share my story of misfortune with you all.

I own a '89 944 S2 (I've had it for nine months now!)
After a intermediate Mobil One Oil change at 66,000 miles 
I noticed an almost immediate increase in engine noise
appearing from the top end (head) of the engine.

Concerned by this I took it to Porsche UK headquarters in
the UK and got AFN to check it over. They basically took
my money and told me there was nothing to worry about!

Well two days ago the Noise went up several decibels and
I shutdown the engine and got it tow'd to my local Porsche
dealer. After looking it over the conclusion is that 
I had lost tension on the Cam Chain from a failed tensioner,
fortunately the slack chain had stretched but not snapped
or jumped so the valves/head are OK. But the bad news is 
that the chain snapped and chipped off several teeth from
both the Inlet and Exhaust Camshafts. 

Cost: (N.B in UK pounds not $)

inlet camshaft      510 
Exhaust camshaft    510 
Cam chain            23 
Tensioner           250 
Gaskets/sundries     39 
Cam Belts            88    - (Not due but what the hell)
------------------------
Labour              250
------------------------
VAT (@17.5%)        292
========================
Grand total        1962 sterling   ($3217)

So some questions:

I knew before I brought this car about the importance of 
the cam belts and getting them changed regularly. But
I don't remember reading about a cam belt chain and the
tensioner? Is this something else 944's can fail on
or have I just been real unlucky?

Any other things I should get looked at done, whilst they
sort this out?

I have been assured there is no alternative but to replace
both the cams because of the missing/chipped teeth and 
that Porsche are the only source for replacements? Anyone
have any alternatives? and is the price £510 ($836) each
high? 

The Moral of my story:

Believe in yourself, if you think something is wrong keep
persuing it. I was made to feel like I was paranoid with
this noise. Obviously it was the tensioner slowly letting
go, and maybe I could of caught it earlier and just got 
away with replacement chain and tensioner.

This has put a little blotch on my lifetime dream of 
owning a Porsche. But I knew the servicing/parts would
be more expensive when I got into this! :-)

and I still love the car and driving it.

Cheers

first and second. More mega bucks!
