"...Over the last two-three days, my car has
developed an annoying idle problem.  It will
sometimes just decide to idle at around 1500
rpm, sometimes (rarely) climbing to almost
2000!..."

My car has the same trouble.  It has been doing that for about a year, =
and has not gotten worse, or otherwise affected driving.  It is probably =
the idle stabilizer.  I am looking to replace mine now.  I assume it is =
pretty straight forward.


RE: drain bolt replacement.  I am glad that someone has had luck with =
these, because it is a nice idea.  Anyway, all I do now to keep the plug =
from falling in the drain pan, is to push in while loosening by (gloved) =
hand.  The oil only seeps out as long as the plug is being held there.  =
When you can tell the last thread is out, just pull quickly away - no =
problem, no more oil burns or dropped plugs.  Good luck.
