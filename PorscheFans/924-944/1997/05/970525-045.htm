You are correct, steel arms are not infallible.  I wrote about using
steel arms as a less expensive alternative to replacing the aluminum
arms if a person is not concerned with originality.

One benefit to the steel arms is that they can be tested and repaired
(or replaced) quite easily and at a lower cost.  They can also easily be
modified to strenthen them.  Cracks can casually be detected if they are
inspected before racing/driving events.  Steel plates can easily be
welded on to reinforce them for racing use. 

You mention Dave Maynards GTS Club Sport.  I previously owned that car
and drove it as my street car almost everyday for two years.  One ball
joint failed.  I could not get the part from Porsche racing department
at the time, so I made one using a different style and the old housing.
Dave has taken wonderful care of that car and he is a real competitor. 
The arms on the GTS were basically the same as the street 924.  Our
924DP car used modified steel arms, as did the Carrera GTR we raced.

You are also correct in that over time and with abuse, everything
can/will break.  For some people, steel arms can be a less expensive
alternative replacement to aluminum.
