Subject: Ride height

Group,

All of a sudden, the "ride height" on the rear of my car is off!  By
that I mean that the distance between the top of the tire and the fender
lip is about 1 to 1 1/2 inches on the driver's side (rear), and the tire
actually goes up under the fender a bit on the passenger side!  Looking
from the rear, the car is noticably lower on the passenger side.  The
distance to the ground from the top of the torsion bar is also about 3/8
inches greater on the driver's side (local shop measured for me).  I
hear a clunk when I corner hard, and they tell me the left rear shock is
leaking.

Am I looking at $$$?

Allen.Look@siigroup.com

The shock does not support the car, and is only for dampening of the spring
motion,
axle control etc.  By itself the shock will not cause ride height
differences.  Suggest
you check the hard points for rust, check out the torsion bars, go to a
good mechanic.
Money cost?  What is money but a collective delusion pressed upon us by a
corrupt capitalist
system run by the evil corporations of the world to opress....
Ahem, sorry, sorry.
