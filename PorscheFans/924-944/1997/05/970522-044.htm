PorscheFans,

	Looking for some advice, my 951 just started making this new whistling
sound the other day that seems to come and go as you change the engine RPM.
 I'm not sure if it's coming from the water pump or maybe a roller
somewhere so I'm going to replace everything in about a week.  I just
wanted to see if anyone had any experiences with intermittent whistling
noises coming from there engine compartment.  By the way the noise was
consistent all day until I took the car on a 30 min highway drive, the
noise seems to have disappeared for now.  Anyway it worries me, any advice
is helpful, thanks
