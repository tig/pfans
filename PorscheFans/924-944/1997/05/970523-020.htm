	Welcome to VA, one of the 2 states were having a Radar receiver 
is again the Law. 

	Va started out saying that "having one is an intent to speed", 
that went down in court.

	Today the law just says its an illegal device if power is 
available to it.

	The reason they started making it illegal was tha the VA cops 
could not figure out how to use instant on units, or even turn thier 
units off. They usaly drive around with them on all the time. 

	The other state Conn. found that thier officers were coming down 
with a high precentage of Testicluar cancer, due to putting the radar gun 
in thier laps. Also they have the highest rate of fast cars with Klenix 
boxes on thier dashs (RD inside).

	You must assume that the cops in VA with radar are burning out 
some part of thier life with them on.

	On the other hand your state NC is known to have the best rolling 
use of instant on Vascar in the states.

	Pay the thing and get on with life, I assume it is cheaper than a 
speeding ticket.
