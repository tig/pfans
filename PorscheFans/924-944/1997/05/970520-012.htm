Once again I am going to open myself up to a major flaming by purists, but I
will do it anyway.

After beiing blown away at the price of OEM style wires I went looking for
alternatives.  I ended up buying a set of Accel wires that were a 'Cut to
Fit' set designed for a V8 with headers.  They were very easy to install,
work great, and the ends are designed to be right next to headers so they
will survive the heat of the exhaust manifold.  Best of all, the set ran $21.00.

I would suggest suppressor core.  If you run copper core, you will hear that
distinct 'whine' through the radio.

After years of racing VW's, dirtbikes, sportbikes and dragbikes, I have
become very good at finding alternatives to high priced parts for my toys.
I pay close attention to quality since the taste of poor quality is much
worse than having your wallet lightened by the good stuff.
