Anders,

go ahead, make my day :-)   (Dirty Harry in Sudden Impact)

Now let's see.  If Dirty Harry had a Porsche 944 Turbo for his patrol car,
upon encountering a criminal (i.e., someone driving a minivan at 100 mph)...

(don't forget to really GRIT YOUR TEETH like Clint Eastwood does, as you read
this for maximum impact, or should I dare say maximum _boost_, that is, since
it's a 951)!

from that famous last scene in the first Dirty Harry movie...

"Uh-uh-uh.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Did he blow 1 rod bearing or 2?
Well, to tell you the truth, I kinda forgot in all this excitement.  Being that
this is the fastest car in your neighborhood, and will blow your head gasket
_clean off_, you've got to ask yourself a question - do I feel lucky today.
Well, do ya, _PUNK_?!"

Substitue revving Porsche engine in place of the .44 Magnum gun going off.

Naweed
