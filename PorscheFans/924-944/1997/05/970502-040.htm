Im my opinion that advice is bass ackwards.

Buy some 17" wheels and go racing. The 17" R1 tires are approximately the same
price as 16"

Ride quality will suffer. So will your pocketbook when you buy 17" street tires.

If you need more than a 245/45/16 on a 951, you should be on a track!

(This coming from me who runs on 335/35/17 R1s on the street ;^)
