Well I should not say enforced but better taught. If you cross the
border up north,
you will see that drivers in Canada stay on the right lane most of the
time. The 
mentality in the US is mainly ; I'm on the speed limit so I can be in
any lane, if you're
going faster, you're speeding and it's against the law. It's a joke to
get a drivers
license in some states...

  The correct procedure is

Agreed, most of the time on multiple lanes hwy ( 3 or more ) the pasing
on the 
right lane is not even regarded.

Depends, if is a red minivan besides a red sports car, the sports cars
will 
be stoped most of the time. Personal experience.

The question is not the speed that you drive but the way you were tought
to do it.
I've drove for years in Europe, speed limit in France is 130km/h (85mph)
and the police 
still allows you 10% more before give you a ticket. The speed is not the
main cause of 
accidents over there, but the alcohol, the fatigue and road conditions
(fog, ice, etc..)
If I'm not mistaken the lowest rate of accidents is in Germany and
Switzerland, with the 
highest in Portugal and Spain ( the roads on those 2 last countries
sucks !! )

He should mention as well the new Camaros.. a lot of them have the same
fate in Ga.

Or just filing up those pockets on some small city, or county that still
