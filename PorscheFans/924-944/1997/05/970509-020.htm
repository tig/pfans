After much beating around, I have found that Porsche has made a significant
change to their clutch for the 944 Turbo cars.

Revelation

Yes, it is true!  Porsche has eliminated the double row of springs on the
disk in favor of the six spring, single row design!

Praise The Board

Apparently, some high up officials at our favorite auto manufacture have
seen the light and repented.  Banished are those little rascally springs
that go pop in the night.

Thou Shalt Upgrade

For those of you that need a new clutch, Porsche sells this as a kit now
and I got mine for $539.00 from White-Allen (937 291-6000).

I suspect that this new clutch uses the same pressure plate and other
components as the original, but if you need additional clamping force for
high horsey power engines, the hot ticket is still the Sachs Turbo Cup at a
slightly higher cost.

I will get back in a later post with the new part number for this kit, but
I just wanted to spread the news so people know not to buy the old outdated
parts that some after market retailers may still have on their shelves.

Your dealer should have returned all outdated parts, but I will get the
number for confirmation purposes.

Marv
