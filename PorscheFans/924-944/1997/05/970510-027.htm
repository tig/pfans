Are you absolutely sure about that he did a conversion?  R-134 has a whole
different set of physical properties than R-12.  The information I have
read states that it requires a larger radiator and uses different pressure
settings than R-12.  The particular article I had in mind stated that


pumping R-134 into an R-12 system was basically suicidal since they use
different lubricants, pressures, etc.  The two are not supposed to be
interchangable.  Is Volvo perhaps subsidizing part of the cost?  A complete
changeover for a car is a very involved process.  Is it possible that this
mechanic merely fixed your old system and put in more R-12?  $50 to
"convert" anything to something else sounds impossible!  Please clarify!
