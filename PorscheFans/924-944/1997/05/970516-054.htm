On my 85 NA 944 I replaced the original wp at about 45K miles with a
rebuilt unit (by J. Pinneau, advertises in Panorama).  It had no problems
whatsoever and the ad claimed they are tested to 40 psi for leaks.  I did
replace it at about 120K miles, only because I was changing belts and
squeaky rollers and as such, it was an opportune time to go with the
updated wp design.  As for a new pump, at that time it was about 3X more $$
than the rebuilt.  Even at 2X price, I doubt a new pump is in any way
better than a rebuild by a reputable shop.  

I believe the updated pump to be an advantage since it includes a bracket
that fits between the cam belt in the area where the teeth come closest on
opposite sides of the belt, preventing them from shearing each other off. 
If a cam belt gets loose enough, I'm sure this could occur on the old-style
set up with no bracket.  I have noticed that even after properly tensioning
the belt, in 10-15K miles it does loosen noticeably.  The bracket gives me
a little extra piece of mind.  The updated pump is essentially the same
price (in rebuilt form anyway).  You will have to drill some new holes in
the rear portion of the plastic belt cover to accommodate the new bracket. 
No big deal, just take your time.    

Incidentally, when the original pump did fail, it did not result in a
catastrophe.  I had parked it and when I returned about 1/2 hour later,
some coolant on the ground was evident.  Lifting the hood revealed no
coolant in the tank.  As I did not have far to go, I just re-filled with
water and drove home the 3 miles with no trouble.  I think if you keep a
reasonable eye on the temp gage, you won't cook your motor.  If you drive
far from home though, this is probably a worthwhile bit of preventative
maintenance.
