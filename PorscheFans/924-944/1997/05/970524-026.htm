If by output shaft bearings they mean pinion shaft, here's what could =
befall you.  I have a 944S2 transmission on my bench which had too much =
preload on its pinion shaft bearings.  It is a little hard to tell what =
happened first, heck, it's a little hard to tell what exactly happened =
at all.

But it seems that it ended up overheating the rear pinion shaft bearing, =
which takes most of the load because the pinion shaft is essentially =
pushed away from the ring gear.  The bearing spun in the end plate, =
placing one of the bearing's shims into play, i.e., loose and into the =
works.  This shim seems to have travelled to the nearest interesting =
spot: between 1st gear on the pinion, its needle bearing, and the pinion =
shaft.  Needle bearing freezes up tight, all kinds of material transfers =
to the first gear inner surface and to the pinion shaft surface.  I had =
to press the needle bearing out of 1st gear!

Bonus round: the pinion shaft, now with far less preload than before, =
pounds along its axis, peening the splines between its and fifth gear, =
on the other side of the end plate.  Fifth gear comes off the pinion =
shaft only with significant encouragement and is now junk.  Remember, of =
course, that the 944S2 has a unique fifth gear ratio not seen in any =
other 944 transmission - so not a lot of good used parts are for the =
having.

Enough anecdotal rambling.  If all your car needs is corrected preload =
on fifth gear, you are probably looking at six to ten hours labor.  If =
you need to replace the pinion shaft bearings, it's probably an extra =
four to six hours.  Shimming and setting up the pinion shaft bearing in =
the case is a major pain in the butt.

The bearings will normally last about 100K miles, perhaps longer, *if* =
you maintain the fluid, like change it every 30K.  That's a major "if" =
because I think that many folks tend to forget about transmission fluid.
