the other you need a roll cage and a lot of other suspension if you plan on
racing it.

If you're just using your car just for track events like I do, and not for
racing,there's no reason not to use them. I like having them on the track
because they
allow me to do the turns much easier since they keep me in my seat; I don't
 have to use my strength to
hold myself down and simultaneously steer.  When I go back to my normal
3-point seatbelt I almost
feel naked.


> tech: you need a brace for the 5 pt. harnesses probably to be installed
behind the front seats and will go all the way across them.  if you take it
 to
someone for the install they are going to go after you with a shotgun
because
installation is from what i hear a pain, a big pain!!!

I installed my five point harnesses in my 944 by myself with no problem, as
long as you don't mind
drilling through the floor of your own car.  The brace was only $99 from
Automotion.  Use heavy duty
eyebolts that racing supply stores sell, with a humongous washer on each
side. I put locknuts on the
bottom.  It took about two hours of planning, and thirty minutes of actual
work.


>but i hope no females ever ride in your car because crotch straps
arent too cool!!!!
Hmmm, the men I've had as passengers on the track seemed to have more
trouble with the crotch
strap than I did.   And I leave my 5-points in my car all the time because
I think they look _waay_ cool.
But, to each his own. ;-)
