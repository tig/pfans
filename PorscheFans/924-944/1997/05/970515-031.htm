The question of corner weighting comes up frequently.  A common
misconception is that corner weighting balances the car left to right
or front to rear.  This is not true.  What it does do is most
effectvely transfer weight to all four tires.

The center of gravity of a car is fixed and can olnly be adjusted by
moving physical parts of the car that have weight.  For example, you could
move the battery of a car from the front to the rear or side to side to effect
the total weight distribution.  

Given all the parts of your car generally stay in the same place, you
cannot change the center of gravity, and therefore you cannot change
how much weight is on your front vs. rear axles, or on the left versus
right sides of the car.

The goal, therefore, is to distributer the wight inthe same manner on
the front and rear axles, or on the left and right siades of the car.
As it turns out, satisfying one condition automatically satisfies the
other.

The goal of corner weighting the car is always the same:

(Notation lowecase side, UPPERCASE end)

l vs. r percentages are the same Front and Rear. ie: Fl/(Fl+Fr) = Rl/(Rl+Rr)

This must mean that:

Front vs Rear percentages are the same right and left. ie Fl/(Fl+Rl) = Fr/(Fr+Rr)

it can only be so.  The first implies the second.

Here's why:

Assuming the car is kept fairly level, it is impossible to move the
center of gravity of the car by adjusting the suspension.  That is a
physical property of how weight is distributed in the car.

That being the case, the following totals will remain constant:

	 right side weight 	(Fr+Rr) 
	 left side weight	(Fl+Rl)
	 front axle weight	(Fl+Fr) 
	 rear axle weight	(Rl+Rr)

Therefore, any car can be wight balanced by a single adjustment, as long as you
don't care how level the car is.

Spring or torsion bar adjustment moves weight from one diagonal (Fr+Rl) to
the other (Fl+Rr) and vice versa.

For example, moving a spring perch DOWN OR adjusting a spring plate UP
on the Rr moves weight off that diagonal (Fl + Rr) to the other
diagonal (Fr+Rl).

The reason for having adjustments front and rear, and left and right,
is so a car can be leveled.

Example 911:

Begin

		FRONT
	500		400
LEFT					RIGHT

	700		900
		REAR

Here we have car with 900lbs on the front axle and 1500 on the rear,
for a total of 2500 lbs.

It can be quickly calculated that 36.0% is in the front and 64.0% inthe rear,
and that the car  is 48.0/52% left-right overall.

The car can be balanced by making sure:

	a) Each axle has a 48/52% split
or
	b) Each side has a 36/64% split.

(actually one cannot be true without the other)

The answer is 432/468 on the front and 768/832 on each rear wheel

		FRONT
	432		468
LEFT				RIGHT

	768		832
		REAR

These are obtained by multipling the total axle weight by the desired percentages.

By adding up you'll notice the same l/r and F/R ratios as originally calculated.

This can be accomplished either by 

	increasing the weight (raising) on Ll and/or Fr
	or decreasing the springing (lowering) on Lr or Fl.

Note that corner balanceing should be done with the driver in place, and generally with 1/2 tank of gas, i.e. in "as driven" configuration.


Now all you need are a set of scales!
