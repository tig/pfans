While the oil piston certainly can cause excessive drag when starting,
my experiences point out two other problem areas that also can cause a
'under 200 RPM' condition. A bad battery or a bad starter can also give
the same effect and will be gotten around by push starting.

BTW, is the 200 RPM cranking speed rule confirmed? 

Another explanation is that both the computer itself and the ignition
module is run by electronics (transistor and logic cirquits). That may
mean that it does not work when voltage drop goes under a certain
voltage (unknown to me - but probably < 5 V).

It is quite possible that voltage drops to these levels when any of
these conditions occur (oil valve, bad battery or worn out starter). If
mr Murphy borrows your 944, expect all three...
