<<All together now: DO NOT LOWER YOUR CAR!!!
....unless you want to start breaking control arms and see ball joint 
failures, quite catastrophic in nature.  Lowering the car changes the
suspension geometry considerably. Jim Pasha among others had sent
out a message about this.  You should at least consider going to the
steel control arms on the front before lowering the car.>>

All together now: WRONG!

Porsche would not provide the M030 suspension option if this was true.
If that doesn't satisfy you, why don't you contact Kelly-Moss Racing?
They campaigned a variety of 944s, 944 Turbos, and 968s in IMSA Firehawk
racing. I guarantee you these cars were lowered!

Of course, too much of any good thing is bad for you so make sure your
ball joints do not bind after you have lowered your car.
