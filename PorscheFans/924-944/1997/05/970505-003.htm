Dear Ed,

If I understand your problem oke, you have indeed a dirty idle stabilizer.
As Kevin says, they almost never fail. Well mine did. And who's to blame
after 10 years of faithfull service.
I removed the stabilizer, after removing the intake manifold, and opened up
the idle stabilizer. In the stabilizer there is a rotor with silver
contacts. I cleaned the contacts with a plastic sponge, the one you use in
the kitchen. 
I expirienced the problem you discribe of the dropping RPM to 400.
After the clean-up of the stabilizer, the problem disappeared. 
Revving the engine results in dropping of the RPM to 1000 then slow to 800.
Before the clean-up the RPM dropped to 1000 then went up to 1200 and slowly
back to 800-900, never being stable. Or the RPM dropped to 400 and then
seemed to have difficulties to climb up to 800.
With accelleration the idle stabilizer has no function.
Maybe this helps to solve the problem.

Like to hear from you,

Rudy, 1987 944.
