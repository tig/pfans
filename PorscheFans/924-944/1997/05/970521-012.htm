I just picked up a '91 944 s2 cab (black with tan interior) last night. 
I was wondering if some kind soul out there could answer a few simple
questions for me .... 

- what oil weight is recommended for this vehicle (10w30, 5w30, 20w50)? 
.... I live in PA/NJ/NY area

- I see that this car doesn't red line till about 6500 rpm ... what
optimal RPM should I be shifting at for normal non-aggressive city/country
driving? 

- There is a button on dash (defroster I think) which automatically starts
up a fan (this is right below a button with a circular formation of arrows
which I think activates cabin air recirculation).  Is this a special
defroster (like is it electrically heated)?  Also, should air be blowing
out of the dash vents, or only the defroster vents? (air does blow out of
my dash vents when this is activated).

- At all times, there appears to be a fan running in the vent .... a very
slight breeze is always coming out (even when stopped and yes the fan knob
is on the 0 position).  Is there some way to turn this off completely
(could be quite bothersome in the winter)? 

- If I use the center console button to lock the doors, and I then turn 
off the car, the center console won't unlock the doors (I have to turn it 
back on). Is that normal?

- On the far right hand side of the trunk, there is a piece of carpet
which can be lifted which reveals a cylindrical weight bolted behind the
rear right hand side quarter panel.  On the opposite side of the car there
is no weight - the previous owner used this space on the left to put some
radio amplifier and car phone equipment which I don't plan on using. Is
the space on the left supposed to be empty, or did the previous owner
remove another cylindrical weight to fit the radio equipment? 

Thanks so much for any insight you can give ......
