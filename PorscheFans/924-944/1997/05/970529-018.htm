Hi gang,

This weekend I took off my intake manifold and
removed the idle stabilizer.  I cleaned it as
well as I could with brake cleaner so the little
door moves pretty easily.  Also, I took apart the
throttle body and cleaned it thoroughly as well.
I cleaned the connections on the idle stabilizer
and the throttle position sensor with contact 
cleaner and put it all back together.

It made the problem worse--the car now idles at a
full 2000rpm or even higher.  This only occurs 
once the car warms up--while it is cold I get a
nice 800rpm idle.  It has been suggested that a
vacuum leak could be causing this, so I've checked
all the connections I can from the top of the motor.
The vacuum looks good.  As a side note, I forgot to
reconnect the TPS before taking the car for a test
drive.  With the TPS disconnected, the car idles at
2000rpm or so even when cold and is limited to the
dreaded 1.2bar absolute.  One other thing, simply
grabbing the TPS connector and wiggling it causes
the idle speed to drop (from the 2K mark).  Can the
TPS be the culprit here or am I barking up the 
wrong tree?  

Also, the hardest part of the operation is getting
the fuel rail bolted back on to the intake manifold.
Does anyone know some great trick for getting those
two bolts back in?  Those two must have accounted
for 10% or more of the total time I expended on
the car this past weekend. :)

Thanks,
Clark
