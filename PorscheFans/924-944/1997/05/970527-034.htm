THANK YOU, LIST!  My earlier post today regarding brake pad warning lights
has received about a dozen responses (all correct answers, by the way) within
about three hours.  Where were you guys (and gal) when I needed help with my
boost problems??  Apparently a lot of you have "been there, done that".

But that was easy, now the tough one. Let's work on the rattle.  I just
installed PFC "80" pads on my 951.  The rear pads sound like a "Just Married"
P-car dragging a string of tin cans behind.  The backing plate is shaped a
bit differently than the OEM's, and they don't engage the retaining spring
clip.  Maybe it's OK this way, but I'm gonna have to run Driver's Ed with the
stereo on, the way this sounds.  That oughta get a laugh out of the
instructor.

These things really do STOP!  Took 'er out on the interstate at about 6:30 am
(should be safe then, right?) to "burnish" - 130mph to 30!  After about three
warm ups, these put me at threshold braking with about 50% less pedal effort
than the previous OEM's.

Nevertheless - any ideas to stop the rattle?  People are staring at me
funny!!

TIA,
Jeff Fortenbery
