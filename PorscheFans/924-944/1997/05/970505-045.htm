Achtung!

     I must sound like a rolling ad for Automotion at times, but I assure
you, I'm not in any way connected, just satisfied.
     
     Automotion just sent me their May Porsche Owners flyer with some cool
sale items. (most of which we could probably do without....EXCEPT....) WINDOW
REGULATORS...

     I had a new system installed on the driver's side and the result was
like night and day!  It was done at Porsche and cost me $450.00. (ouch)

    The flyer has them on sale for $149.98, all years/models. It says
bolt-on, but I'm not sure how involved it actually is. (comments from the
voices of experience???)

    PS Had the car detailed last Friday.  It's now...TOO pretty!

86 Black is beautiful 944
(Man-o-manachevitz...is replacing those rear speakers a huge pain in the ass
or what?)
