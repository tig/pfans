No, no, Adrien. I don't want to look like (1) that I can really drive, or
(2) that I've got sponsers.  Bad enough that I'd be throwing down the
gauntlet to all those tarted up 914s. And what's wrong with good ol'
American stripes? After all, I'm in the Rocky Mt Region group, and they
don't go in for that pretentious European stuff.

Anyway, I've got the sponsers figured out. Want them to have to do with my
profession -- auditory physiology on echolocating bats. I feed them
crickets and mealworms, so I figure decals from Rainbow Mealworms and
Flucker's Cricket Farm would be - well -- different -- Flucker's logo has a
cute little cricket with a tophat. Then there's Narashigi Instruments,
Harvard Apparatus, Modular Instruments Incorporated, Teimann's Surgical
Supplies, etc -- figure it would be very intimidating to the opposition.
