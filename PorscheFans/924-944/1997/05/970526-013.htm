Listmembers:
      I have a terribly annoying rattle that seems to originate from around
exhaust components, specifically the down tube  or cat converter area. It
manifests itself only after normal operating temp is reached. Also the noise
is un-duplicatable, by this I mean, with engine off, climbing under car on
jackstands shaking every possible part. I have spent hours under car moving
heat shields ect with no luck, as I cannot produce vibration frequency of
running auto. BTW my car has a collapsed right side motor mount which
obviously adds to idle speed vibration.  
    Are these symptoms in line with others have experienced with cat combs
that have broken loose. Is my 'squashed' right mtr mnt taking clearance away
from some unknown heat shield on the right side of  engine bay? Also a list
member once gave advise of removing cat and shaking out loose particles and
re-installing. Is this feasable? All experiences would be appreciated, as
this tin can rattle is driving me nuts!

Thanks

Alec Miller
