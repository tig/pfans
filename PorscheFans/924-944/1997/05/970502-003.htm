I think you are right about the 944 and the Turbo in particular.  I think
the price of the Turbo S was approaching $54,000 when new.  Both the price
and the performance for the 944s were closing the gap on Porsche's 911
models.  To add insult to injury, the 911 was a hand built car, whereas the
944 line was not.  With such a small differential between the two lines it
was just a matter of time before a correction was due.  Porsche marketing
had to choose in an era where the sports car market was collapsing very
rapidly after 1988 and Porsche's sales were sagging very badly.  In that
market atmosphere, the face lifted 968 had little chance of survival.  The
968 was suffering from sticker shock as well compared to the rival sports
cars of that day.

As with most companies, when the economy shrinks, business does too.  It
was not surprising to see Porsche return to it's roots with the 911, the
very car Porsche had put on the chopping block in the late seventies.

Porsche has seen a turn around, which is good new for all of us.  The
Boxster is a new kind of production car for Porsche and is contributing to
a solid recovery.  The 911 line is also seeing an equal upswing in sales.
What remains to be seen is what happens to the Boxster as it matures and
gains more horse power.  Much greater potential for the Boxster can be seen
budding from its seams and it looks like the 911 series may see competition
with its own siblings once again.  Surely the performance envelope and the
price will spiral upward in the years to come.  Could this mean the
ultimate retirement of the 911?  Stay tuned.
