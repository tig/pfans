Question #1:When a 944 pressure regulator fails and leads to too high
fuel pressure, the engine will die, but not because of too high fuel
pressure.  Why?? 
Question #2:  A 944 won't start...no injector fire...disconnect one fuel
injector wire clip and the engine will start...Why??

A clue answer to #1 was given in #2.  When a 944 engine either won't
start or dies when running (maybe it will restart, maybe it won't), the
first thing to check is to see if the injectors are clicking when
cranking (evidenced by using a NOID, a stethoscope, a screwdriver to
your ear or whatever).  If there is no "clicking"...you have no injector
fire either because of no voltage or no pulsing ground from the DME.  

Easy test...disconnect one wire clip from one injector and crank the
engine over...if it starts...you have found the problem....WHAT IS THE
PROBLEM???...The fuel pressure regulator is bad.   Yes, the fuel
pressure regulator.  See, the fuel pressure jumps from around 2.0bar to
7bar or more when the regulator closes.  The increased fuel pressure on
the injectors causes them to draw more current.  All 4 injectors get a
constant 12 v from the DME RELAY.  Injectors 1&2 are paired and get
their pulsing ground from DME CONTROL UNIT wire # 15, and 3&4 get their
pulsing ground from DME CONTROL UNIT wire #14.  This means that
injectors 1&2 always fire at the same time, and injectors 3&4 fire
together.  It is not sequential. 

When the fuel pressure goes to high, too much electrical load (I can not
be specific here on the miliamp draw) overcomes the ability of the DME
CONTROL UNIT and it shuts that function down, causing you to lose
injector fire...the engine dies.  If one fuel injector is unplugged,
that reduces by 25% the load on the CONTROL UNIT, and it can produce the
current necessary to fire three injectors, the engine will run.   

Try it yourself.  Run your engine and clamp off the return line from the
pressure regulator .  The engine will die.  Disconnect one injector
(won't hurt the catalytic convertor), clamp the line...the engine will
be running a little rough on three cylinders...but it won't die.  If you
have a NOID and a duplicate harness connector, you can easily see the
electrical results.

Many, many people have purchased fuel pumps, DME's, you name it because
of so-called electrical problems, when it is a simple fuel pressure
regulator problem.  If you have a pressure gauge, that is another way to
test the problem.

Jay Jobe was the closest to solving the quiz, so I will send him the
prize of two free 944 oil filters (Jay, you need to e-mail me your
address).

Any respone??  E-mail me or I can be reached at (817)332-6547 or
