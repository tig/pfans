Dan,

The heater control valve on the 924's are mechanical.  Of course, I may not
be following you though, are you talking about the valve right at the back
of the head below your ignition coil that regulates (on/off) the flow of
coolant to the heater core?

Mine seems to be functioning properly, unless it is broken on the inside.
And my feet are still roasting.

Thank you for your reply.

Jay
