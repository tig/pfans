	There is a great deal of talk concerning to chip or not to chip. IMHO I
don't think chipping will trash your car so long as the car has been
maintained, and you don't over boost the thing. My 951 is used primarily for
the track. I was going to chip it for the extra HP which would put myself on
a more level field with Mr. "Turbo S" Lenoble, the deal fell through which
was fine. I chose to spend my money on suspension improvements instead of
HP. When I can drive my car with its 217 stock HP to its' max then and only
then (except if Barry starts to blows me away : ) ) will I go the easy route
of being faster by "drag racing " down the front straight. Yes, I know there
are other reasons for chipping but most people on this thread have said they
want a faster car with more HP, not that they want to reduce the lag that
these cars have. I agree with Dana who said " why race the Mustang....."
	I am currently in the process of deciding on if I should sell my car and
buy a race prepared NA 944. Yes, I would give up the beloved Turbo for a NA
car! I would do this because I can club race a NA 944 more "competitively"
then the Turbo. From what I have seen in the NA stock class the racing is
closer and I could be wrong but it seems to be more driver ability then
anything else, with the exception of suspension set up. Remember folks, most
of the time it does not matter what is in the car but WHO is in the car. I
have watched drivers in NA 944 blow away drivers in Turbos, 993's ect. Two
of these guys are Mike Macaluso and Paul Foster both in Metro NY PCA. I
would advise anyone who is thinking of giving up their car, a car they might
love, to buy a car with more HP to ride with either of these guys, you may
change your mind. Paul is in the process of buying an 89 Turbo, a car he
will be able to drive obscenely fast. Paul did not give up his NA 944 for
more ponies he gave it up because of bent valves. ( Tech note: Replace your
timing belt every 30K miles.)
	This is just one persons' opinion, mine. I am not foolish enough to think
that I know it all,or even a little, many of you will think I haven't got a
clue, that's fine. My long winded point is in most cases learning to use the
HP/Car you have is more rewarding then going faster by buying a faster car,
or creating a faster car by chipping it. Unfortunately I do not have a fire
extinguisher with me, so try to keep the flames low.
