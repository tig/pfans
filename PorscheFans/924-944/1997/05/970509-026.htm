     Ah, the old when it rains, my foot gets wet syndrome,
     
     The 924s have two places to drain water from behind the firewall. One 
     is above the steering shaft, and the other at the front of the battery 
     well. They each have hard rubber flappers on them whose only purpose 
     I've been able to devine has been to trap dirt and leaves and dead 
     bugs that eventually trap water behind the firewall. If you corner 
     hard enough, that water will come right down the heater fan, which 
     sits on the curved hump against the windshield. It's a straight path 
     down through the heater core to the heater duct above your throttle 
     foot.
     
     Clean those drains, and your wet foot syndrome should only arise in 
     really heavy rains. 
     
     And what are you driving your Porsche in weather like that for anyway?
     
     That's why Gawd gave us pubs!
     
     Yours in the Stuttgart Spirit[s],
