I ran into this same dilemma when I did my belts not too long ago, and I
pulled my hair out, just as you are doing.  I had a German Porsche mechanic
give me an interesting alternative to the method you describe, one which
apparently goes against the sacred factory manuals but which this mechanic
claims supercedes those manuals.  At that time I went around and around
with several others on the list but never came to any definite conclusions.
That mechanic suggested that you should *never* counterrotate the engine.
Turn it over a couple of revolutions and just stop when you get to TDC.
Necessarily you will have to use a higher gauge value (5.7 instead of the
usual 4.0), but it is much more repeatable.

This is probably going to raise a ruckus among group members, especially
those who are more purists than I, but I can't make sense of this reverse
rotation thing and I despise the poor repeatability given the particularly
tight specifications.  Just for kicks, try the no-reverse-rotation thing
and see what reading you get.  Then do the infamous counter-rotation and
see what it comes out to.

And your observation about the crank is even more to the point-- you can
move the crank quite a bit without even budging the camshaft.  And, as an
aside, the engine only runs one direction, so this counter-rotation makes
even less sense the longer I think about it...  Maybe we shouldn't go there.

My car doesn't have the auto-tensioner but I removed all the idlers and
rollers on my car when I did the belts and they were *all* bad.  It was
only $100 to replace them all, so it was definitely worth it.  I would
imagine that the tensioner is worth replacing while you've got it apart.
Why risk it?

Yes, but to compound the problem you have initial belt fatigue.  That's why
you get such a high reading with the gauge for a correctly tensioned *new*
belt but almost half for one that's been on the car a while.  Hence some of
the concern over the tension setting.  This becomes critical in situations
where people don't recheck the tension after 3,000-5,000 miles and then
every 15,000 miles.  If you're checking it regularly, it would seem that
your margin for error becomes less critical.

When it comes down to it, the fact that you're sweating it this much is
usually the sign that you're being careful enough to get it "close enough".

Best of luck to you!  Let us know what you determine.
