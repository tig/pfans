How ethnocentric we are,

indeed in the late 80s and early 90s the economy was on a downfall and sportscars were not at there highest sales point. Because i am so young i dont remember too much of that because it didnt effect me as i was living in Europe.  I think, however, if you take a look at the times it is also when the British pound rate changed immensly and the German Mark began its nosedive. To say that the American economy had a lot to do with the end of production, I THINK (IMHO), is a bit of an overstatement.  The price had gotten out of hand and almost matched the 911 (the 951 S, of course)  Porsche could not have its flagship go down to a cheaper, faster, better handling car (why we'll never know, they were cheaper to make and the profit margin would have been almost the same (production lines good)).  The fall of the 944 has also got to take into account the price of similar vehicles from Japan. The RX-7 was nothing but a CHEAP imitation but became very popular as people saw numbers tha!
t were close to the same except th
e large sticker difference.  The real competitor though was the 300ZX in my opinion. (porsche seems to think so too as i read it somewhere)

While the 968 is a great looking car but the numbers are not great, at least not Porshce-like people thought.  The Sport suspension option witht the larger wheels, etc. was a fairly priced option but many people didnt go for it.  The 968 problem was simple PRICE, and poor backing.  You can look back at old magazines and tell me if you see a 968 add with there is no substitue!!  If the 968 had backing like the 986 (boxster) and had the company not had the highly publisized money problems it would have succeeded and we might have even seen a production 968 Turbo.  

Porsche will have the same problems again as they are catering to a small market (which i am fond of myself) so money will always be an issue.  Let's just all be greatful for the 924/931 944/951 968/986 911/930.  

Happy Porsching,
sorry so long and you can all feel free to disagree i don t mind because there are certain things i am sure i dont know!!
