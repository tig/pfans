I was wondering if any folks have participated in other club racing
events, such as SCCA, EMRA(east coast), or other clubs other than PCA
with the 944, 944T, or the S2.  I'm curious how it stacks up in the
classes that it winds up in.  

From talking to people, and seeing what people drive (in PCA), I get the
definate feeling that the Turbo is not the car of choice.  Even in PCA
racing, I hear that it's not competitive in it's class.  I am curious if
that is the same situation in SCCA, etc.

I've also talked to a guy at a shop that outlined about $10K of mods you
could spend on a 944 Turbo and still keep it stock!!  Is there any such
thing as a "spec racer porcshe"??

Personally, I own a 944T, and am just starting out in PCA Drivers
events.  I know I have a ways to go, but I would like to make some long
range plans, and wonder if the 944T is the way to go.

Thanks,
