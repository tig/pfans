 My 83 944 has had various heating problems, fixes and upgrades over the
years
 it has been our track car in San Diego. Specific upgrades have been the 6
 blade fans (for the 3 blade ones on the early cars), the radiator upgrade,
 manual fan turn on switch to cool the radiator in pre grid, and finely a
 replacement of the intermixer. This was after two o ring failures and one
and
 a half  engine rebuilds. I now have the S2 oil filter carrier which replaces
 the intermixer and has fittings and thermostat for an external oil cooler. I
 placed an after market oil cooler in front of the radiator/ac condensor and
 added the 924T/931 front panel with the nostrils. I removed the ducting from
 the under bumper air intake and fashioned ducting from the nostrils to the
 radiators etc This allowed the fans to work and all the air to hit the
 radiator/condsenor/oil cooler. I have added a VDO oil temp gauge to the
dash.
 I use water wetter, (as does every water pumper racer that I know) and swear
 by it. 
 It is now a cool and dependable track car. 
 I hope that this helps
