For every one's interest, it is not permitted by FCC law to "jam" or
intentionally interfere with any other operational use of radio.  As a
"HAM", one of the many questions on the FCC exam covers just that issue of
interference.

Amateur Radio operators have two modes of operation on the RF spectrum.
The first is primary and operators have full use of those slices of the
spectrum when operating within the legal limits of the FCC law.  Secondary
privileges are granted to some frequencies that are shared (mostly UHF) and
Amateur Radio operators must stand down if found to be interfering with
other stations with primary privileges.

In short, it is a violation of Federal law to interfere with any other
station, including illegal and unauthorized stations, by any operators (HAM
or otherwise)!  Amateur Radio operators are particularly sensitive to
retribution by the law as they will get their operating privileges revoked
where as non licensed offenders get a slap on the wrist (FCC is pretty lame
unfortunately).  It is a Federal offense to jam radar!

As for scanners, I tend to agree with the FCC claiming that ALL RF
frequencies are open to public listening (with the exception of Cellular
Phone - outlawed by Congress under protest by the FCC).  Unfortunately,
local laws can, and do violate those privileges in order to protect law
enforcement efforts.  The question is if your police have the rights to
demand that in the face of Federal law.  If you are well heeled, you could
challenge that law in court, or present a class action challenge.  I do not
know if "posting" makes much difference
in this case.  I guess you were lucky you got the detector back, and
hopefully the fine is trivial.  Then it just isn't worth the fight.
