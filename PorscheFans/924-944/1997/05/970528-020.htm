Hi Rick,

While your in there be sure to look for oil leaks around the shafts.  If you
find any, you'll need to replace the shaft seals.

The easiest way to get the shaft seals out is to insert a prying device
(screwdriver) between the shaft and the inner lip of the seal and pry out.

Also check for loose idler pulleys (i.e. some play in the pulleys).  Any that
are loose, replace.
