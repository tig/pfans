Posting for a friend without e-mail access :

This problem is presently permanent on 2 different 1988 944 Turbo Cup cars.
Full investigation was performed on one of them.

During an instructor day at the track the warning light (!) on the dash suddenly
lit and the following indications occurred all at once : Pressure Gauge indicated
no pressure at all, Coolant Temp went suddenly above max temp, Fuel gauge
indicated act erratically.
The car was stopped immediately and my friend could breath a little after
realizing that there was still oil, and the engine wasn't outrageously hot.
From now on, the warning light stayed on with all the other gauge at their
abnormal positions explained above.

After the event more investigations took place .
When the car is started everything is OK. As soon as you rev the engine a little
the gremlin is back with the all the same weird indications.

The entire instrument cluster was swapped without any ameliorations. After that,
all the wires were checked in the dash area to verify the connections.... NO
change.
The oil pressure was confirmed to be normal even if the Pressure Gauge is
indicated 0.

What else can he try?

What circuit is common to all those indicators apart from the instrument cluster?
The DME?

Thanks in advance for my friend.

Please reply directly for faster answer since I'm on digest mode.
