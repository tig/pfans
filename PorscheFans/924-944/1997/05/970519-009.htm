To Wes and anyone else not familiar with this publication, it is put out by
PCA and is available either thru your local "Goodie Store" or directly from
PCA National Headquarters (contact Ruth Harte, Executive Secretary).
It is "A Guide to Porsche Production Cars, 1948-1995.  It is not 100%
accurate, as information provided was gathered from a wide variety of
sources, not all of which agree, but it does contain a wealth of
information regarding VIN designations, especially useful when looking at
used vehicles or restoring vehicles.  It also lists some of the major
changes in specific models from year to year.  And, it isn't expensive -
only 5 bucks US.

Also, everyone should be on the lookout around the end of the year for a
new book on our beloved 924-944-968 series.  It is currently being compiled
in England by a gentleman named Peter Morgan.  His photographer is
currently in Chicago getting ready to take pictures of several vehicles to
be featured in the publication - and mine ('88 944 Turbo S Limited Edition)
is one of them.  Should I order a case of the finished product, autograph
them, and sell them on-line as collector editions??

Anyway, everyone should get a copy of the PORSCHE FAMILY TREE to add to
their library.  And as is customary, usual disclaimers apply.  I am,
however, an ardent supporter of PCA, and this list.
