Well, I have a 924, which is (unfortunately) lacking the great 944
fenders, but... there's a teacher at my school who has an all-white Supra
(and it *does* look like a ceramic urinal).  Her headlight motors are
frozen, so she has her headlights permanently up -- I always park next to
her, just to piss her off.  It always makes her really jealous.  It's
really funny, too, 'cause for what she paid for the Supra, she could get a
944 that runs better, looks better, and *is* better -- and still save
herself some money!

(The headlight motors for a Supra are supposed to cost something like
$600.  I can see why she hasn't fixed it, yet.)
