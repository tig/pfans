My friend searched for over a year and a half looking for the perfect S2.=
 =

Then one day it appeared, shiny black with beige interior and polished
wheels.  When he returned to the dealer to make the purchase, it had
already been sold.  The frown on his face almost touched the ground.  The=

next day the sky opened up and out came the sun.  The dealer called and t=
he
other deal had fallen through from lack of financing.  Wild horses couldn=
't
of stopped my friend and his checkbook on their trip to the car lot.  As =
he
was handed the keys, the other buyer called to say he had found financing=

My friend drove the new prize home a happy man.

A year of Porsche bliss followed accented with the joys of waxing,
detailing, upgrading and personalizing.  However, the seas of matrimony a=
re
not always calm and a stormy divorce loomed on the horizon.  Not with the=

car but with his shrew like wife.  The car was better looking, more
intelligent, and weighed less than the wife.  The choice and eventual
outcome was obvious.  The wife goes and car stays or so he thought.  Seem=
s
in the divorce settlement among other things, the wife wanted his left
testicle and half the S2.  My friend could live with one testicle but not=

without his car. =


I had suspected he was up to something when he offered to let me drive hi=
s
precious gem in the first auto-x of the year.  He was cleverly setting th=
e
hook by letting me drive his car.  His plan worked, I became a partner in=

the S2 thus saving it from her evil lawyer and the auction block.  My
friend still has his car to drive.  The ex wife, although not getting her=

pound of flesh, has a bag of money instead.  I have a (or another) car to=

race.   Who says no one wins in a divorce.
