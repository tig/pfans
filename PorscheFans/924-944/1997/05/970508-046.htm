<< I've located a set of OZ Racing Fittipaldi
 Star wheels in 9 and 10x17 at an attractive price, but I'm a little
 concerned about using them on the street.  I'd hate to end up with bent
 rims if they can't take daily use. >>
Tom, 
3 piece wheels are just fine for the street. They offer the advantage that if
you bend a rim you only have to be concerned with replacing or repairing that
segment that is damaged. Of course the 993 wheels are also fine. To me it
would be a matter of which wheel I prefer and the price. The other thing to
consider is tire size. Those are awfully large for street use. With the
appropriate tires the car is going to tend to "hunt." If you put smaller
tires on the looks are going to be compromised. I have 255 x 17's on the
front of my car and 275 x 17's  on the back. The wheels are 8.5" for the
front and 10" for the back. Trust me when I tell you it is a handful on the
street. Of course my suspension is set for track work and that makes a HUGE
difference on straight line stability.
