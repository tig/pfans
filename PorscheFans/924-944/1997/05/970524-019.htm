This would make sense, except that even if you blow the oil filter (as I
did), you still have at least some pressure available (for a short time
anyhow).  The piece of information I have states that the DME uses the
engine RPM as its input.  If your oil pressure *gauge* (not the oiling
system itself) goes bad, you can still run, but if your engine speed and
TDC sensors go bad, the computer is blind anyhow, so it would only make
sense to shut off the fuel pump.  The oil pressure sensor tends to be a
rather inaccurate device anyhow-- it's not meant for accurate readings
(imagine the cost if it were!).
