I was just on Mobil's web page and ran across this in the FAQ's about Mobil 1.

Q. WHEN CAN I START USING MOBIL 1 ? CAN MOBIL 1 BE USED IN AN OLDER VEHICLE ? 

A. You can start using Mobil 1 in new vehicles at any time. In fact, Mobil
1 is the factory fill for the Corvette LT-1 and LT-5 engines. And, Mobil
and Porsche just announced a new partnership that will also have all
Porsche cars manufactured at Zuffenhausen plant will be lubricated with
Mobil 1. One of the myths that persists about Mobil 1 is that new engines
require a break-in period with conventional oil. Current engine
manufacturing technology does not require this break-in period. As the
decisions by the engineers who design the Corvette and Porsche engines
indicate, Mobil 1 can be used in an engine from the day you drive the car
off the show room floor. 

Mobil 1 can also be used in older vehicles with high mileage on them.
However, in older vehicles, if there is a problem with oil consumption or
leakage, it may not be economically wise to convert to Mobil 1 until such
mechanical problems have been corrected. 

Interesting, huh!
