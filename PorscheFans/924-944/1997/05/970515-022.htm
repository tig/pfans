Arif,

I have had the unfortunate experience to have customers with BOTH
944s and Biturbos.    From the maintainability perspective I am not
especially impressed with either.   Quite frankly, the the Biturbo is
utterly unable to stand up to its own horsepower, and the design of
the fuel system was done by committee members who didn't talk to
each other.   The 944 engine is not so much better as we would like
to believe.   The oil cooler, rod bearing lubrication, water pump, and
timing belt engineering, etc., should be considered an embarrassment
to the myth so-called superior German engineering.   All this in the
smoothest, sweetest package on the road.

Clearly, if you want both the handling and the horsepower, you need to
consider a 951.   While the maintainability issues do not go away, you
will have all of what you want in the same package.   If you want
bulletproof, you need to move on to a late 911 or 993.

Let the flames issue forth.

Dave
