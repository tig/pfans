Hi!

I hope I'm not too late....

I chaned my tacho 2 month ago.

1 remove the two screws at the top of the insrument holder. They are located
inside the cylinders of the rpm and the multi function instument.

2 Now you can pull out the plastic with all three instruments. The first
centimetres are easy, problem is to get it over the cover  of steering, turn
signal etc. You need to bend it a little, but somehow it works.

3 Now you can see the instrument lights cables etc. Remove the tacho axle,
cables and lights and press the complete insrument out to the front. There is
a rubber seal inside making little trouble. Don't turn it! There are some
plasics to prevent turning. 

Oh, I forgot: It's much easier with the steering wheel off.

I hope this will help you!

Carsten



I tried to get the tach out of my dash last night.  I was able to find the
instrument -- feels like a big, metal cylinder -- but pushing on it only
made the dash creak (not a good sign).  I know I have the right thing,
'cause I unplugged one of the lights and the tach is now unreadable at
night.  (I guess I broke it trying to get it back in, or something.)

My question: how do I get the damn thing out?  I assume that the
instrument itself is located in some sort of cylinder to keep it from
going too far back, and I'm just pushing on the cylinder.  But I've felt
all around and can't find a way to get to the actual instrument -- and I
actually got my head down into the footwell, under the steering wheel, and
still couldn't make any progress.  I felt something like a screw, or maybe
a nut -- does this have to come off?

I'm trying to avoid taking off the steering wheel (which seems to be the
only alternative) if I can.  But it's getting to the point where I can't
tell how fast I'm going by the speedometer *or* the tachometer, and I
figure it's only a matter of time before the fuel gauge lights go, too.

Thanks.  And if it matters, the 924 dash setup should be the same as on 
the pre-85.5 944.
