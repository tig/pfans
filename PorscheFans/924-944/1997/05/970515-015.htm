I guess on the highway the following does not matter as much, but
I had problems when switching cars with the inability of most cars
to handle corners as well as a 944.  I had gotten so spoiled in my 944S
that when I got my Volvo wagon I managed to skid the front end about 
10 feet and straight into the adjacent lane because it just would not
turn (it was not even raining).  I hated the feeling of losing steering
control.  
I still feel my 944S was an all-around superior car in terms of both passive
and active safety but none of my friends seem to acknowledge that since
the Volvo has that highly effective campaign making people think they
are the safest cars in the world (they are not, the Saab 9000 is the
safest car out of Sweden, both in all-around and passive safety aspects).
I visited last night Bill's WWW site and read how he launched 50 feet off
the ground after being struck by deer.  In a similar situation, I believe
that these other so-called safe cars would have:
a) Flipped while spinning and skidding after the collision or
b) Landed nose first.  
All else being equal, the 944 is balanced front to back, which is why
Bill's car did not nose-dive into the trees but fell flat.  Most cars I
know are front-heavy and would have hit the ground nose first.  Something 
tells me such an impact would have been much more devastating than
having the car land flat.  
My point:  The 944 is very safe car.

I apologize for getting on the soapbox, I just wanted to warn individuals
who are considering getting rid of their 944 to get another P car.  I know
that I will get another 944 soon.
