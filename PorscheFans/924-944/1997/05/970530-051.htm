Jeremy, there is an Allen head bolt just under the front edge of the seat. 
It is accessable through a hole in the plastic trim piece.  Using an allen
wrench (don't remember the size), you can turn the bolt, which in turn
drives the fore/aft seat gear.  With patience, you can move the seat all
the way forward or backward, as needed.  The problem is in the switch. 
The switch is expensive (~$90) and comes with a wiring harness.
Replacement requires removal of the seat, which is not difficult once you
get to the four allen bolts holding it down using the method above.  I
have learned to repair my switch with the seat still in place.  The spring
switch contacts get a little flat, and need to be pried upwards a little. 
This is not easy, as there are ball bearings that fall out easily.  I used
electrical grease to hold them in place.
