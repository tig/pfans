Before I got my 944 six years ago, I had the ugliest Porsche (or the
trickest Volkswagen...) for a number of years. Even this, the 914, grew
on me, because Porsche design their cars for technical excellence.

Every Porsche, (914 included) has evolved enormously over the years.
That the old Audi/Volkswagen ESV design that was the base for the 944
was to one of the most successful and nice look=EDng cars is, in my
opinion, due to the fact that Porsche have put large amounts of good
engineering into what basically a 1960:s design study.
Heck, I even remember pictures of the Brasilian Volkswagen Puma (?) - a
design that in 1972 looked suspiciously close to the 924.

Of all the significant, unique things that distinguishes a Porsche 944
from a crowd, I think, too, that the fenders are 'it'. But I want to
emphasize that it is the synergistic result of the Porsche design and
continious development have made this car such a 'good' car. =


A 944, regardless of model is a 'feelgood' kind of car, that makes it
easy for almost any driver to drive it competently, but with a amount of
feedback and interaction that most other cars just can't match.      =

Some 944's are faster, some are more expensive, some are newer - but
still, they all manage to give their drivers an amount of aggregated
driving pleasure that is hard (or even impossible!) to match for any
other car.
        =

So, it may even be that the fenders we all like so much, was just a
clever engineers way to accomodate those fatter tires and wider track,
needed to make the 924 a little better...
