Actually, I just called the 1-800-PORSCHE number and they were 
more than willing to give me details and information about the
program.  They also gave me names of some authorized dealers in
the area that are supposed to have the program in place and took
my address so that they can sent out the material.

The bad part here was that I found out that Parktown in St. Louis
was supposed to have given me the 12mo warranty for free, instead
of wishing to charge me for it when I bought my 944S that I was told
today qualified for the program.  Given that the car was fine I
did not need the warranty, but it upsets me nonetheless.  The lady
I talked to at Porsche told me that for problems of this type I
should call the PCNA home office at Reno, Nevada and they will
take care of these issues.

Enojy!!
