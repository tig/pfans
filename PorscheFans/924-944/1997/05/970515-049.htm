George,

I thought that shocks just dampened vertical movement, and that they
didn't really support the weight of the car...  I thought that was what
the springs were for (either coils, torsion bars, or leaves)...  Of
course, I'm no shock or suspension expert.  Do they really play a part
in ride height?  My car came with a sport suspension package, not M030
but M474 or something like that.

On a side note, I read an interesting snippet recently that says the
rear shocks on the Boxster have solid pistons because they are used as
an integral part of the rear suspension, "transferring  lateral forces"
or something like that.  Neat. ;-)

Allen
