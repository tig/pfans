Ya, I agree.  I have long since given up the notion that I will somehow be
able to overcome the effects of time and pressure on my Porsche.  I first
came to this realization when I witnessed my spouse placing her coffee cup
on my hood while she got organized in her car.  My choices were to shoot or
divorce her, and after 18 years neither option seemed financially feasible.
 And then there was the time that my wonderful oldest child's bicycle break
levers perfectly lined up with a 4 inch scratch on the paint.  But with no
photos or eye witnesses, all I had was circumstantial evidence.  I figured
that if I didn't dump on her too bad maybe she will stop by to visit me
when I'm old and gray.  And, at least no one has stacked 2X4s on it like my
friends Austin Healy 3000.

So, what the heck, my Porsche isn't perfect but it is one heck of a lot of
fun to drive.  And of course I certainly sympathize with anyone who still
tries to keep their Porsche perfect, but I just cannot waste the brain
cells on any longer myself.
