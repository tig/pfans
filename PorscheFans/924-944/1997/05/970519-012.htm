As for the compatibility issue, I have seen in the autoparts stores a
can of stuff that is supposedly used to flush out the system to clear
out all of the R-12 in preparation for conversion to R-134a, which I
would think should take care of the compatibility problem.

As for the efficiency of the converted system (aside from the
lubrication issues), by simply switching over to the new refrigerant
without changing any components, you'd be operating the system along a
different thermodynamic map than the ideal, most efficient map.
Apparently the R-134a runs at a higher pressure, so that in order to
obtain maximum efficiency you'd have to either replace or modify the
compressor and both heat exchangers (condensor and evaporator) to run
with the modified thermodynamic cycle (since R-12 and R-134a have
different P-V profiles, etc.), plus possibly needing a new drier, hoses,
and other components to withstand the higher pressures. 

However, this might be simplified (and cheapened) for a slightly less
than perfectly optimal configuration by modifying the compressor to
produce higher compression (like a stroker kit! :)or replacing it, and
simply replacing the necessary seals and increasing the airflow over the
heat exchangers to increase the rate of heat exchange (like additional
fans).

Does anyone have any ideas how one could go about upping the compressor?

BTW, Matt, do you know what the thermodynamic purpose of the drier is?
I've forgotten it, if I ever knew...

....just throwing my muddled thoughts into the pile...
