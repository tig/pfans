I read in the list today that whenever someone keyed their CB, the 944
would accelerate (cruise control).  I have noted in the past that
Porsche is one of the few automobile companies that have a blanket no
comment or not recommended attitude towards aftermarket installation of
ham, CB and 2-way radios in their cars.  I used to work at Delco HQ  in
Indiana in RF testing, and I have to say that RF in the modern world is
an increasing problem and Porsche seems to be hiding their heads in the
sand about this (or der Elves are just not wanting to bother with
aftermarket stuff).  As a ham radio op (KA8QZG)and electronics tech, I'd
say that if any systems are adversely affected by your cel-phone, CB, or
2-way then stop using them.  Unless you know about toroids, bypass caps,
power regulation and mu-metal RF shielding and aluminum foil (: you will
just make a mess trying to fix these problems and you could with
continued use blow computer chips, adversely affect ABS and traction
control and cause expensive repairs.  If your cruise control floors the
accelerator and won't disengage Scotty won't be there to save you!
