We should star making a list of dealers and Garages that provide a good
service. I normally don't take any s.... home when dealing with dealers.
Ask me for a fortune for a simply job and give the old excuse .. "
that's a Porsche, it's the easy way out..." that won't fly at all !!!!

Let's start to add all the bad experiences, remember guys the list is a
tool and a lot of new owner are looking for some advise on new places to
service their cars
