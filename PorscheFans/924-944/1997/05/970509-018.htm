I read with much interest the thread about tramlining and an increase of
only 10mm in tire width.  Usually I try not to get into heated debates
(especially when one party calls another party "full of shit"...not
pleasant) but I've had some experience/knowledge in this area so I'll
dabble.  When I bought my '86 951, I didn't drive it much before I switched
to the 17" setup (225/45f:255/40r) so I can't comment much on how
differently it drives.  However, on my BMW 5-series, I run 225/60/15 in the
winter and switch to 235/45/17 in the summer and I do notice a big
difference!  Note that it's only an increase of 10mm as well, but around
Toronto where I live and there are many grooves in the highway lanes, the
summer Yoko AVS-Is tramline horribly.  Now, I wouldn't give up my summer
tires for anything, but there is a pronounced difference on public laneways.
Why?  Well, in addition to the the issue about tire width, two other
considerations come into play: the aspect ratio and the sidewall stiffness
of the tire; actually related so maybe only one more consideration...
Anyway, I digress.  With a lower aspect ratio tire, the sidewall of the tire
is naturally stiffer; as well, lower profile tires usually mean the sportier
summer tire will have stiffer sidewall designs and tire compounds.  With a
stiffer compound, there is less 'give' (for lack of a better term)and is
transmitted throughout the suspension and steering of the automobile.  So,
even if we only move from a 225/50 to a 235/45 (245/45 to 255/40), the lower
aspect ratio of the tire and the overall design of the tire must be taken
into consideration when consideration the issues of tramlining and
ride/handling tradeoff/deterioration.  And as a prolog to this whole thread,
let's keep the subject/content of the e-mails friendly (can't we just all
get along??!!) and to the topics of Porsches.  Subject lines like "Farzaan
is full of shit" does not have anything to do with Porsches and really has
no place in a forum like this.  (Off my soap box now...)
