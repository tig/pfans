I did not have a personal experience but I did witness a control arm
breaking on a lowered 944, the individual had no idea what to look out for.
He was entering a gas station a bit faster than he should and there was
a bit of a trench where the road joined the station's parking lot where
rain water drains, not anything big or extraordinary.  The wheel went one
way, the car went another as the control arm broke upon impact, scraped 
a few things under the car,had to replace a bunch of them, not pretty.  It 
is not just what happens at the track but things like potholes and other 
everyday road hazards.

Personally, when I had to replace my lower control arm due to a failing 
ball joint, the local shops would not install a rebuilt arm and a new 
one costs more than $600.  I was not comfortable with replacing it myself,
so getting a rebuilt one and installing it was not an option.  Fortunately,
George B had a good one, so I was OK, but what for you may cost only $150
to repair, may cost >$600 for others.  This is really not intended as a
flame, though.  

I really was concerned that the S2 owner did not seem to be aware of what 
can happen when a 944 gets lowered.  For every rule (such as do not lower)
there are exceptions, IMSA-race 944s are lowered, but they also do not
ride on stock parts.  Another fellow P-fan mentioned that as long as   the
distance between the wheel hub to the bottom of the wheel arch is not less
than 13.5", one is OK.  

Once more, no flaming is intended, as someone else said, I am not
wearing a Nomex suit.
