You will know when you spin the clutch 12 000 RPM...

A lot of things are 'dynamically balanced on your car: Tires, brake
discs (noticed the small metal clips on just some of the vent channels?

The crankshaft is dynamically balanced (to a very complicated
balance/out-of-balance pattern) and interacts with the balance shafts to
counteract the harmonic vibrations inherent in the 4 cylinder 4 stroke
engine. If the clutch (that spends most of it life wedged to the
flywheel) is out of balance (warped, lost/dropped a spring or just
uneven wear) this will upset the whole complicated setup.

To 'dynamically' balance a clutch, it is set up together with its
flywheel, and it's pressure plate - all mounted together. Then it is
balanced, much the same way as a tire. However, specialist equipment
must be used, because it will have to be spun at much higher
revolutions. The other way, 'static' balancing would be just balancing
it on a pivot.       

Your dealer may (most likely) not have done this without special order.
It is time consuming, and most garages have to send it away to perform
this operation.

Quality control at better (OEM/original) clutch manufacturers make this
practice less important today than it was only 25 years ago - especially
if all components except flywheel are changed for new ones.  

Just check if the engine feels good and without vibrations, then it is
no real need to worry.
