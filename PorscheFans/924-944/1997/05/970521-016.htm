Well I finally got around to putting the Optima in my 968.  I put it
on it's side in the original battery location and was able to use the
original battery clamp to hold it down.  I did have to add a small
piece of wood 1/2" x 1/2" x 6" between the clamp and the battery
as the original clamp is too short to get a good grip on the plastic
tabs on the battery.  Seems to told very tight but if you plan ahead 
you might be able to buy a larger metal clamp.  The ground wire to the 
battery is very short and stiff but I was able to get it on the
terminal.
Be sure to spread the clamps before you try to put them on the post.
Took about 30 minutes not rushing.

PS:  Regarding cost of 968 clutches be sure you don't let things go
so long that you need a new flywheel.  Last price I saw for a new 
flywheel was around $2000 US for the 968.
