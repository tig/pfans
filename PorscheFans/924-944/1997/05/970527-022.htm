Porsche Fans -
        FWIW I have been successfully tensioning my own belts for four
years (about four times I have done it  - including two replacement belt 2k
mile checks). I don't buy the story that the tension measuring tool is
neccesary. I think the money for tool could better be used elsewhere on
these cars. $400 is not justified for a tool whose field use is compromised
by the layout and position the belt is in to begin with. IMHO the
experience and skill needed to precisely adjust the belt with the measuring
tool are the same as those needed to appreciate the appropriate tension for
any toothed rubber belt tension. So why not use the money on something more
fun...like synthetic oils/grease or new tires.
        A few years ago I took the advice of a Tampa Bay (Florida) Porsche
shop owner (more than ten years experience at the time) who said he didn't
use the tension measuring tool enough when he owned it to justify the $400
cost, and so he sold his! He said he and his mechanics did it by hand. He
said it was like any other toothed rubber driving belt (I'll give you it's
a vital one to the successful long term operation of a 944) and to avoid
too much tension... and check it often.
        I have done the disassembly up there so many times that I can get
the check and adjustment done in an afternoon - easily under two hours,
although I always ensure I don't rush the effort, and so I usually take
three to four hours. Because I have been patient learning my way around the
belt - all mounted and difficult to reach, see, and touch, I have made it
easy for myself to check it often! I think that is the key. With repetition
and double checking I have become familiar with the tension resulting from
a given amount of use and my adjustments. My experience has given me
confidence.
        The first time I did the adjustment I ran the car with all the belt
covers off so I could see the action of the belts, and the fixed and
adjustable tensioner races. As I revved it up and down I could see the belt
accumulate "too" much when the belt was "too" loose. And so small
adjustments were made until I saw the "right" amount of belt and race
action. It was definitely a subjective technique - one that relies on my
judgement of a rubber belt's performance on an engine that is going to heat
up and expand. But hey...success always involves risk right? What I think
the factory had in mind was the new and inexperienced dealer mechanic doing
the job. I'd bet the highly experienced guys don't use it. The tool tries
to make the effort objective. I think it's field use is so compromised that
it's not worth the cost. I suggest practicing breaking rubber bands until
you can predict the break! Ha!
        In any event I think common sense, and an appreciation for the
degradation rubber materials undergo in a really hot environment is the key
to successful adjustment. My car is an 89 NA 944 (ie 2.7L motor equipped
with a auto-tensioner) and I do NOT rely on the tensioner to apply the
right amount of force on the belt. I consider this design only an aid,
since the tensioner takes up slack so I don't have to drag my wife and kids
under the car too to get the job done! Ha! (They'd only get in the way
anyway...see prior comment re: belt layout is confined)
        I use common sense and an appreciation for the limits of a toothed
rubber belt. I won't be mad at myself if it ever goes south, because I have
accumulated a bit of confidence to consider the risk worth the benefit.
Besides the tensioner is mounted with studs and nuts, and a spring which
accumulates dirt. The accumulation of any extraneous material will affect
the force the spring applies. Any engineer who has taken a statics and
dynamics course will confirm this.
My car has over 100,000 miles on it and I want to see 200,000, so I replace
things before they break. Bad luck may come my way...but I will use the
oppurtunity to find a four valve motor and get some of the power Porsche
should have put in it every 944 model in the first place!
        The best other advice I can give (I know it's been said many times
before) is to ensure the cam belt is replaced every 45K. Also by that time
the various pulley's bearings are beginning to wear a bit, so replacements
may be warranted. Besides replacing them usually quiets the motor. (which
is generally very beneficial)
        Good luck to all.
