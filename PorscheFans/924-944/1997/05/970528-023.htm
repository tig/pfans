P-Fans,

Would appreciate some input that might diminish (or not) my lastest worry. 
Last time at driver's ed, during hard driving and 90 degree ambient
temperature, the oil pressure on my 944 S2 dropped from its usual "5"
reading down to "4". I've never seen this before, since it's usually pegged
above 5 during hard street driving, so it's got me worried. I'm using 5-50
wt. Pennzoil synthetic, and the engine was not low on oil.  Once the engine
cooled down, the pressure was again above the 5 mark. Has anyone else
experienced a drop under similar conditions? Just wondering whether it's
something to be expected.
