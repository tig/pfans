Precisely. The fenders are indeed very sexy -- something about the shape
that's both masculine (strong, hunched over) and feminine at the same time.
They look especially good with large wheels and tires underneath.

I enjoy the view out of my left-side mirror daily.

The 968 is a very good looking car; I especially like how they cleaned up
the back end. From the front, I prefer the 944 (951) -- actually, I still
think it's one of the most attractive front ends on any car. Truly
timeless. The 968 looks more line the 928/993 at the front, but compared to
its predecessor it looks anemic.
