Speaking of misinformation......

The liquid that comes out of the condenser  enters the dryer....
goes down a tube in the center of the dryer....
up around the tube in the main body of the dryer....
through a filter pad that removes particular contaminate....
through the silica drying agent.....
then exits the dryer....

liquid the whole time!

I agree that liquid at the compressor will destroy it, but you are forgetting
that the flash from
liquid to gas occurs at the expansion valve.  After the expansion
valve/evaporator... it's a
straight shot back to the compressor.  No dryer etc.  to "stop liquid from
reaching the compressor"
No liquid gets back because we have converted it to a gas in the cooling
process.
If it were to go from liquid to gas at the dryer.....
you would have a very COLD dryer and a very WARM car. 

That's about what happens when a dryer starts to get restricted.

It is important not to hook up a dryer backwards as often the reverse flow
will dislodge silica from
behind the filter layer in the dryer sending it into the refrigerant stream.
 
Next stop the expansion valve and it will plug it in a heartbeat.  
Funny how one bead of silica fits so nicely into the expansion valve inlet!

Just for info... at the 38 or so psi that is on the suction side, R12 would
have to be colder than about
30F for it to be a liquid.

Gotta neat little chart in the service manual that shows the temp/pressure
relationship.
Neat little chart also available from most A/C supply shops. 

As for moving oil... gaseous R12 moves oil very poorly.  Liquid does a much
better job.
That's why you use 141 to flush a system. It stays liquid much longer at rood
temperature and carries oil out very fast.
It would take hours to push all the oil out with a  gas.

Again hope this helps someone chill out this summer!
