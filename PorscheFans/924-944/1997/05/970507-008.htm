A long time ago I asked my mechanic about doing that, painting the calipers
red, and he said not to do it because it would be "too messy and the paint
would eventully come off as powder and get on the pads, and ruin the wheel
rims, etc., etc."  There is a company in California, I think, who specializes
in painting surfaces that are exposed to extreme heat.  I can't remember their
name (Thermal Coatings Inc., maybe) but they usually have an add in Autoweek
magazine.  They might be able to paint the calipers and do the white "Porsche"
lettering also.  I think Automobile Atlanta has a complete kit available that
includes 4 vented cross drilled rotors and 4 of those big red calipers that 
you see on the 911 turbo 3.6, but all outfitted especiall to fit on our
944/951 cars.  Costs about $4,000.00 though - bit steep for me!

Yes, if you pull the original Fuchs wheels off the car, you should see thier
crest or logo or something with the word Fuchs Metalworks (?) or something
like that in raised letters (not etched in) on the back surface of the wheel.
I have no idea who made the OEM phone dial or C2 style wheels.  Anyone else
out there have any idea?
