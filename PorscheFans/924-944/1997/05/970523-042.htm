Octane boosters tend to boost octane 1 or 2 points.  I think 104+ adds about 2
points.  You should probably use one if you plan to have extended periods of
WOT/full boost.

However I guess it depends how hard you drive your car.  Racing conditions seem
to denote full throttle at every oportunity.  Which would get a little hairy on
public roads :)

sensors. I used to have an air/ fuel ratio gauge that was based on an O2 sensor
and it specifically said that it could be exposed to lead fuel exhuast for
short periods only.
