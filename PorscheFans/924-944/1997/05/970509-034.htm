Hey, there's no need to get nasty.  Heck, I even bought a set of chips
off you.  Lay off.

The wheels that Tom is considering buying are the same offset as I had
and they tramlined with factory alignment.  The offset is where the problem
is here, not the width.  Tom's wheels are the same as I had with the same
offset, thus it will create the same problems.  Tom, from what I've gathered
is trying to keep his car as refined as possible.  You, I know are building
the killer street/race car where your idea what is considered acceptable
may be different to Tom's and myself for that matter.

Where the hell did this come from?  I've seen the credentials you have
and I've even asked for your advice in the past.  I had those wheels on
my car and the car drove like crap.  I changed the wheels to the Cup wheels
with the PROPER offset and the car stopped tramlining.  And, I don't
appreciate you calling me a kid with a lot of time.  If don't like what
I write, give your own opinion, you have that right!

I hope that you are alone in your opinion of my advice, because frankly,
I could easily keep it to myself.  I take time out of my day to assist those
who ask for it.  Sorry if it pisses you off or makes you laugh.  I've never
lied, any advice I've given has been from my experience with my car.  People
who have taken some of the advice have come back with favourable results
and I think Tom will too in this situation.

Farzaan.
