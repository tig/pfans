Rod,
    I recently replaced many components on my NA '87 engine, including
the valve guide seals. Since I didn't want to remove the head, and
didn't want to loose the valves into the cylinders, I placed the pistons
@ TDC to hold the valves up. (I made my own tool to compress the springs
from above) I can tell you first hand that this is definitely an
interference design! The valves will hit the pistons! How the cambelt
could break at ANY RPM without causing damage is unclear to me. Maybe
those local "experts" aren't such experts after all? 

Good Luck!,
           Ezra
