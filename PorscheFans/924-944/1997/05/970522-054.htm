Oil filter rupture:

I have seen (dont ask!) oil filters split open when starting a cold
(below freezing) engine, by oil pump pressure alone. If the pressure
regulating valve is malfunctioning this would be quite possible to
happen, and be related to the malfunctioning valve. But the low cranking
speed connected with a stuck valve beats me too. 

Istook pressure quiz: My theory is as the injector valve is
electromagnetically opened, and closed by a combination of return spring
and fuel pressure. Excessive fuel pressure will keep the injector closed
all the time...
