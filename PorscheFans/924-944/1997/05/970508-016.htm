To some extent you ask the impossible. I don't think anyone can answer your
question in the affirmative when one of the conditions you place on the
answer is that there be NO POSSIBILITY of engine/transmission damage.

That said, I'll just tell you my experience. I bought my 87 951 in late 87
and replaced the chips with whatever Automotion was selling in 1990. Car
had about 30,000 miles on it at that time. The chips made a big difference
in performance. (The chip kit I bought came with shims for the wastegate
and required drilling the cycling valve--supposedly a no-no). Car now has
105,000 miles on it and has had no engine or transmission failures. Since
1994, it has been to approximately 25 autocrosses and time trials and to
about 12 Driver's ed events at Sebring, and it is my daily driver. I use
Mobil 1 and change the oil about every 3000 miles. 

I anticipate that sooner or later, the head gasket is going to fail.
Whether it will be due to, or hastened by, the chips is speculative. I
think it will probably be caused more by driving at Sebring, which is a
long course (3.6 mi) and the car is constantly at 6000 rpm or above. I also
expect that if I don't change the rod bearings shortly, I will probably
burn the bearings on the #2 piston, which apparently is not adequately
lubricated in 951's (this is why synthetic oil is considered a must in
these cars if you use them on the track).

Maintenance costs on 951's are high anyway, but so far, I don't think any
of my bills have been due to the chips. 

Would I do it again? Absolutely. Once you have experienced the performance
gain, you will not want to go back.

Just my opinion.

Mike
