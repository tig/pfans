Hay this is a weird one......  I had the hood and front end of my 944
painted two years ago.  This was the second time it was painted since the
dealer re-painted the hood before I picked it up.  By the way, I found out
that the original dealer re-paint job was clear coated and it should not
have been.  The car has only been driven 300 miles since the last paint
job.  Anyway, when you look at the hood from a 45 degree angle it appears
that there are a few concentric circle patterns directly in the middle. 
They are not coffee cup rings so I can't blame my wife.  I'm just curious,
what could have caused this?

Any ideas, thanks.

Frank
