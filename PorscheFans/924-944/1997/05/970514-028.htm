In Chicago Region PCA, 5 or 6-pt harnesses are REQUIRED for on-track events
(Road America, Blackhawk Farms, Gingerman) in all cars running in all run
groups except for the novice (slowest) C group, where OEM belts are OK.  In
any of the other groups (A, B1, B2), both sides must have the race harness
if there is either an instructor riding with a student or a student riding
with an instructor.  We don't allow passengers in any vehicle unless at
least one of the people is an instructor.  For parking lot type auto-x, OEM
belts are OK.  One hint to remember - high back sport seats will allow the
shoulder harness to slip down past the shoulders of the driver/passenger,
even with a harness bar, so the easiest accessory to get is one of the
straps which fits over the high back and has loops thru which the shoulder
straps are fed.  And when you take off the shoulder straps, they don't fall
behind the seat either.  These straps are available from Dave Turner
Motorsports in San Diego - he is a regular advertiser in Panorama.  I've
been using them for 7-8 years now, and I love 'em.
