Message text written by Matt Warner
> The particular article I had in mind stated that
pumping R-134 into an R-12 system was basically suicidal since they use
different lubricants, pressures, etc.  The two are not supposed to be
interchangeable.  Is Volvo perhaps subsidizing part of the cost?  A
complete
changeover for a car is a very involved process.  Is it possible that this
mechanic merely fixed your old system and put in more R-12?  $50 to
"convert" anything to something else sounds impossible!  Please clarify!

Let me make this perfectly clear (sorry couldn't pass that up).  Stan owns
the A/C and radiator shop that I have been hauling my personal and company
cars and trucks to for the last ten years.  Stan has a non suicidal nature
and waited until his friend's shop had done several hundred R134A
conversions during the last year before venturing into the unknown.  Stan
has been doing between one to five conversions a day for the last five
months and has had one failure.  The compressor went out on a car with
88,000 miles on it.  He doesn't know if it was caused by the R134A or not. 
He says he has had little problem converting 1988 and newer to 134.  The
older cars may require a new compressor or some other parts that I can't
remember.  He changes the o'rings only if they need to be changed. 

The only downside is that the R134A does not blow as cold.  He will not do
the conversion on a marginal A/C system or Porsches or other exotic iron. 
From what I gather from the other list members, there are shops that are
successfully converting Porsches.
