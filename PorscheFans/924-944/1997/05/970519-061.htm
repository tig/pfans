With Great Regret, this one is up for sale (only because I'm replacing it
with a low mileage '89 S2)

Details:

Sapphire Blue / tan interior (partial leather front seats)
well maintained, very clean
3rd owner; records since second owner (back to early 90's)
94K miles
Everything works except for the cruise control (never missed it anyway)
New Koni Sports (about 1K miles on them)
225/50-16 front Dunlop SP8000, 245/45-16 rear BFG ZR tires
original paint from what I can tell.  Minor imperfections from door dings
and front end chips.  Paint still shines nicely.
Major services performed (belts at 82K), clutch at xx, updated exhaust
manifolds during recall campaign.  
Autothority Stage 2.5 chips installed
Clifford Alarm with remote door lock/unlock feature

Runs Great!  I just came back from a 200 mile round trip and keep trying to
figure out how to keep another 944, but... need the money and the garage space.
I bought it last year; had looked for six months before settling on this
one.  I KNOW this is way better than average condition!!  Heck it even
drives better than my "new" S2!


$10,500 or best offer.  Located in San Francisco.   Come here for a
vacation, go home with the best souvenir ever :-)
