Hi, Marv,

I had the same problem during my recent clutch job.  I took an easy-out 
bolt extractor that was too small, kept grinding the tip off until it 
_almost_ fit into the stripped bolt head and then tapped it into the bolt 
head with a hammer.  I then directed the flame of a propane torch through 
the gap between the pressure plate and the flywheel and onto the bolt 
shaft where it screws into the flywheel and heated the shaft.  Being 
careful to not to tip the extractor out of the bolt head, I was able to 
remove them all.  I hope this helps.
