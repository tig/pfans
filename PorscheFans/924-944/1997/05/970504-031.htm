The only reason I bother checking my e-mail any more is because of this
list.  (Well, maybe not the *only* reason, but...)

This is really, really common.

Whenever I quit PINE (mail reader), I always type "frm" (lists pending
e-mail messages).  I only quit PINE when I've read all my mail.

*cough*  My manual is, right now, resting between my keyboard and monitor
for easy access.  Actually, I read it when waiting for the modem to
connect (or just waiting).  The repair manual is upstairs someplace, in
about four thousand parts.  (The fuel/emissions section has been separated
almost to its component molecules by now.)
