Hi Everyone,
	I've got an 86 951 with 50K miles on it. I am hearing a couple of
strange noises.  When accelerating in 1st,2nd or 3rd gear I hear a clunking
coming from the rear of the car, I'm not sure if it is specific to one
side.  The noise is intermittent and not very frequent.  The other is
pretty much constant. When I am in gear (1-3) and decelerating I hear a
grinding, meshing sound. Sound like something rattling in the gearbox.  The
car has done this since I purchased it 1.5 months ago.  The mechanic who
checked it out did not notice or chose not to mention it.  The checkout was
done by a very reputable shop.  The last noise I only notice during street
driving (coasting in gear) I did an Auto-X and did not hear it at all. Any
ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Also please email me
directly if possible, for some reason I don't get every digest...
-Paul
