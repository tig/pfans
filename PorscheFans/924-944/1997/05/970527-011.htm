Hey,

With all this talk lately of high failure rates of the 944 series =
aluminum A-arms, I was wondering what was the consensus of the group as =
to the cause of the failures?  Was it really a design fault or a =
manufacturing fault?  Many sources claim it is a design fault ( =
Automotion's catalog states that the 944 A-arms were =
'uncharacteristically under-engineered'  - I take that to read as =
structurally under-designed for strength/fatigue), but I find that hard =
to believe that Porsche can't properly do structural design.  But then =
again, they sure loved aluminum on this car and it's possible there were =
some arms that had casting or machining flaws that resulted in stress =
risers and the resultant crack propagation.  Makes one wonder if they =
had forged the parts if these problems would have happened.  ( Oh, for =
the fatigue resistance of forged parts!)

I appreciate the value of unsprung weight like any sports car =
enthusiast, but was the move to aluminum for the A-arms a sound design =
tradeoff?  I've alway felt that the failures were most likely a =
manufacturing flaw or a failure to call out the proper material/heat =
treat/surface finish, and not a 'true' design flaw.  What's the =
ENGINEERING consensus?  How many of you have experienced this failure =
and under what circumstances?
