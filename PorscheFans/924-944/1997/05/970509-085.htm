Naweed,

Definately do it.  As far as the engine is concerned, it's the same as the
Turbo S.  Slightly different exhaust valves, different turbo exhaust shell,
and different chip programing.  Here's the lowdown on my car:

'86 951.  I bought it almost 2 years ago w/ 107k miles.  I'm the 4th owner.
 the only owner I didn't have records from was the second owner, and he/she
is the one that chipped it (I estimate at about 60k miles)  The guy I bought
It from didn't drive it hard, but I've put 35k HARD miles on it.  You just
have to let it warm up properly (engine oil, not just the coolant temp!) and
be alert to any potential problems, and it should last awhile.  The engine
can definately handle the extra power.  The tranny can handle up to 350+ hp.

With any piece of machinery, the more stress you put on it, the more you
reduce the life span.  But it's not a linear relationship.  What I mean is 10
hp doesn't equal 1 year or 20k miles.  The first 80 hp may equal 1 year or
20k miles, and the next 20 may equal another year or 20k miles.   (all these
numbers are purely hypothetical, only to get the point across).

At 140k miles, my CV joints are showing signs of wear, and my tranny is kinda
loose (clunky going to second when cold), but it's got 140k miles on it for
god's sake!

YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE CHIP!  Bottom line is, all the Camaros, Mustangs,
Vettes, 300ZXTT, 3000GTs, Supras, etc, that you can never quite seem to catch
will be in your rearview mirror, and interstate onramps are much more fun!
