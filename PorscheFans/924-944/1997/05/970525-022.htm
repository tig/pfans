Why not read the very good FAQ available at

http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html

where these questions are adressed in a very clear, understandable and
even entertaining way. 

The short answer to your specific question:

Yes, you have to change the cam BELT, and no, you do not need to change
any cam chain (as there is none on a 924S). 

There are only a few things that will break on a 924S/944 engine, but
the cam and balance belts will not only render the car immobile, they
will also take valves and pistons down when (not if, when!) they break. 
As you are about 1500 miles overdue on this one, proceed with
caution...    
Good luck!
