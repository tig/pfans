     I finally got my new 17" 993 turbo replica wheels (five spoke with a 
     twist) with 225/45 and 255/40 BF goodrich tires. I have an 86 951 that 
     used to sport 205/55 & 225/50 dunlop sp4000s.  First of all these 
     wheels look FANTASTIC on this car.  They make the car look like a 97 
     model. Many after-market wheels look somewhat out of place on these 
     cars.  These wheels look like an OE fitment.  I have noticed no 
     increase in tendency to tramline (I don't know if the early offset 
     cars are affected differently) and no noticeable degradation in ride 
     quality..  However, this wheel and tire combo is MUCH heavier than the 
     old setup.  And we all know how bad increases in rotational inertia 
     are.  I haven't driven the car enough to figure out if the weight 
     difference has a noticeable impact on acceleration.  But I suspect it 
     has.  Also, I did notice a slight tire rub on very hard acceleration 
     with two people in the car.  I should be able to get enough clearance 
     without disturbing any paint though.  I plan to use my 16" wheels for 
     track events and for winter wheels.
