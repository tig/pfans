Well, called my insurance underwriter today to make sure that I can
autocross my car without voiding its insurance.  Guess what?  That's
exactly what happens as soon as you participate in any sort of organized,
competetive event -- even if it's not on a track or it's one-at-a-time.

Since it seemed likely that I'd have to change insurance anyway, can
anyone recommend a particularly good company (i.e., one that doesn't
charge extra for races and stuff)?  I was told by one extremist that he
probably wouldn't even own a Porsche if not for autocrosses, and though I
don't go that far, I *would* like the get my money's worth out of my car.

Thanks...
