Hi!

	I have an 86 951.  I've heard so many stories about
broken aluminum control arms and read about the Fabcar chro-moly
ones, I was wondering about the older steel arms that my 924S
and the pre- 85.5 944s had.  Would they work on my 1986 951?
If they will work, what are the benefits and liabilities? I need to
replace the LF ball joint now or soon, and Porsche must have had
a reason to dump the steel ones.  What was the reason?  Aluminum
is cool and the Corvette has them type of mentality?  Lower unsprung
weight?  Cost savings?  Planned obsolencense? Help meee.

	I have decided not to sell my car;  I'm having too much fun
planning how to outrun the IPD on the next episode of, "COPS".  951s
are FUN!  Boy-toys love 'em too.
