Yes, that's them.  Mine are both black, no yellow that I can see.

Now, one thing I should mention is that your timing belt hasn't snapped,
has it?  I mean, if you look through the little viewport you can see the
camshaft moving when you turn the engine over, right?  It's just an easy
thing to miss and would certainly keep the car from having spark.

That aside, someone else posted that swapping the coil out would be a good
test, and I agree-- assuming you have one available to swap.  Something I
used to do when I was having this trouble was to push-start the car.  This
way I easily made the 200RPM.  If push starting gets the engine running,
then it's pretty safe to say that you don't have a coil problem.  Another
observation I made when I was having trouble was that if I pulled the
center wire and placed it near a ground, it would give a brief spark just
as the engine stopped cranking.  This was while I couldn't get a normal
spark.  As for the chances of it being the coil, I wouldn't think so just
because this is a non-mechanical part and I still have the original coil in
my car.

According to the tech bulletin I have, July 1986 (87 model year) and later
got the one-piece valves, so it does indeed sound like you have the same
three-piece relief valve as I did (April of 86, I assume?).  The job is
messy and fairly involved, not from a mechanical point of view, but from a
clean-up point of view.  The reason is that you will normally replace the
oil-cooler seals while you're down there and then you have to thoroughly
clean the cooling system of all oil and garbage (diluted "Shout" stain
remover appears to work well) a half-dozen times or so (laborious).  You
will also end up doing an oil change.  This is to say nothing of all the
oil which will get everywhere when you drop the oil cooler.  I didn't do
that particular job myself (didn't have a place at the time), so I can't
tell you all the details, but I would imagine that space is tight, being
right underneath the exhaust manifold and all.

As for parts, the updated valve itself used to run just over $200, but may
have changed since Porsche restructured its pricing.  The updated
turbo-style oil-cooler seals (may not apply to your car?) ran about $90 in
a kit.  There is also an updated oil-cooler housing, but this isn't
absolutely necessary if your old cooler is still working (it can be
pressure tested).

Mine too is resting (till I can afford a new steering rack, clutch, etc,
etc, etc!)

Let me know what you find.
