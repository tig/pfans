The whole interior of my 924 save the dashboard and the back seat is now
resting comfortably in the house. What was thought to be a couple of hours
worth of carpet removal and cleaning has turned into a nightmare of wires
and screws. OK, so it ain't that bad, but..

The center lever on the heater control panel is *very* restrictive. If I
push it to the far right (with great difficulty I might add), it pops back
to the middle. I was planning on detaching the cable and see if the cable is
at fault, or if it is the heater control valve. But I can't figure out a way
to get the cable off! Do I have to take apart the whole heater control box,
or perhaps the control valve? No tips from Haynes here. As far as I can see
from the description, this is supposed to be an easy job that can be done
without taking apart the console. What's the trick on these cables? I sure
can't figure it out even with the whole damn car apart..

I also need to get the control box out of the way to do some rewiring, so if
your trick only works on this specific cable, please tell me how to get the
other ones off as well.
