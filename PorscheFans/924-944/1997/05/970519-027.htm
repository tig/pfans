I thought 968' used rubber centers. If you don't plan to run SCCA events
which require OEM style clutch, maybe the single spring turbo cup sachs
disc will fit. Anyone tried the "Racemaster" clutch sold by Automotion?
The 968 version lists for $1154 (ouch).

OUCH! Once in a while (a few times per yr) should be OK but I would'nt be
making a habit of it for every auto-x run. On sticky R tyres I normally
launch at around 3500 rpm and can still get enough spin on the tyres to
clean them off the line. But then most courses around the Northwest are
not straight shots, they generally lead directly into a short turn at the
start.

Yes, you would see acccelerated wear or failure of the clutch unless
you have a specialized race clutch (which are'nt to happy with street
starts) if you do consistent 5000 rpm drop clutch starts. Does centerforce
make a clutch for 944'?

I don't see much accelerated wear on the pads from auto-xing.

A good set of front pads for auto-x can run $70-140. And it's an easy
do-it-yourself job.
