I've read a lot of "I respect them, but for the wrong reasons" messages about
police in the past couple of days.  I think that's the main lesson to be taken
from all of this.  These guys are working for salaries that many of us would
not accept if we were washing cars.  They see the American system of justice
in action every day, watching high-priced lawyers getting the well-heeled guys
off, while the people of their economic class get screwed most of the time.
When they see your fine sparkling Por$che, their first instinct is often to 
treat you as "one of them" not "one of us".  Regardless of what you may have 
been told as a child, the U.S. of A. is not a classless society.  Unfortunately,
most police are financially relegated to a class of people that do not normally
drive expensive cars.  That's our fault as much as is it theirs.  When was the
last time you heard an American politician say "let's raise taxes to pay police 
a better salary" and then get elected?  Oh yea, we heard the current prez 
promote taxes for more police, but not better salaries.  You get what you pay 
for folks, and we're getting a lot of red-neck authority seekers along with the 
few that truly do their job because they know it is important.

No, I'm not a policeman, and I don't play one on TV.  I just happen to have 
an ex-brother-in-law (via an ex-wife) who in my opinion was not being paid 
appropriately for the job he was asked to do.  He was a good cop and a good 
father, but was not able to make ends meet with a growing family.  Sorry that 
none of this relates directly to 924s or 944s, but I know he would drive one 
if he could.  Even an older 924 was out of the question for him.  He didn't 
have the spare time to work on one himself, and certainly could not afford to 
pay someone else to.

I think the bottom line is: there's no good way to handle the current situation,
so let's change the situation.
