Ben,

The device at the end of a starter that throws the gear into the flywheel
is called a bendix/bendex (whatever).  There are some applications where a
starter doesn't use a bendix at all and is continually engaged to the
flywheel - but I've only seen that on certain tractors.  I'm not sure if it
is related to the Bendix Company or not - could be but I doubt it.  Bendix
is a huge supplier of brake parts for US and Imported cars.  Believe it or
not, they also made .45 caliber automatic pistols under contract for Colt
during WWII - so a friends grandpa used to tell me.
