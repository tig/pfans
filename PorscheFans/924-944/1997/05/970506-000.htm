Hi Adrien
Thanx for your answer
I'm afraid, but I don't know a shop in Prague where is possible to buy
the 'Clever service Book' :). And I also don't understand german. So,
there is only one way to bought it - travel to England (It's hard to


order without a VISA) and of course - it's a little bit expensive. In
addition - my last visit of London was not so cool as I expected.

And now about SKODA. It's another division where I'm working - it's a
Nuclear and Coal plant division, but...
....there is a new model of SKODA car called Octavia -
http://www.skoda.cz. The new Octavia looks closest to the western cars
and his price is even compared to the price of a western cars. I'm not
interested in Skoda cars, everyone have at least one here :). Skoda is a
totally practical car, not a car with a 'soul'.
And the 944 can push 3 oldests Skoda cars away from a road. Thanx to
God. :-))

Bye
