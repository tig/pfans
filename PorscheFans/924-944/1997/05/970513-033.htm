Powerhaus (powerhaus.com) offers a turbo conversion for the S2/968
engine. They claim about 400hp at the  rear wheels.

P-Fans,

All this talk about about more power is making me twitchy and wanting to
modify something, like my S2.

Paul brought up a truely delectable topic that has been raised before,
but
will never die. It's too nice an image.

>How come we never hear about 968 Turbo conversions?  I'd take a 968 Turbo RS
>over a 993 TT in a heartbeat!  Let the air-cooled guys deal with dropping
>half the engine just to change a few oil filters!

If they're taking C4s, shaving pistons to reduce compression ratios and
adding a turbo, this could be done with a 944 S2 or 968.  3.0 liters and
a
951 turbo and electronics ought to give more hp and low-end torque then
a
2.8 liter stroker package.

This would break my promise to myself to NEVER make any mods to my S2.
I
got it because there's little you can do to it to get more power, unlike
the 951, which is just begging to be modified and eventually
over-boosted.
But anyway, does anybody know of, or heard rumors of, any outfit that
would
be glad to take your money and attempt this conversion? Forced induction
on
3.0 liters and 16 valves would have to make a fantastic track car, even
at
stock 951 boost levels.

If there are any performance outfits out there listening, I don't really
need to buy that house. You can use my S2 as a test mule if you do it in
the winter and promise to have it ready for spring time-trials.
