Well Andy, I have.

At first pull the connectors from the temp-sensor, mark the positions.
(found at the top right of the radiator, standing in front of the car.)
Then recharge the battery.
If the fan stay quiet it's oke. 
Now pull the biggest relais you can find in the fusecompartment (that's the
one for running the cooling fan).
Reconnect the connectors, then plug in the relais. if the fan starts to
run, you have a bad sensor.
If the fan runs without the sensor connected, but with the relais plugged
in, you have a bad relais.

In my car I had problems with both, althought not at the same time.
But it's still a great car, I wouldn't miss her(?) anymore.

If this was at any help, please let me know.
