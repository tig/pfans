1. You wake up at 3 a.m.. to go to the bathroom and you stop to check
your Email on the way back to bed - but don't bother to check on your
944 on the driveway.

2. You name your children Eudora, Mozilla and Dotcom, and nickname them
Spyder, Boxter and Turbo, also, you call your wife S2 instead of SO.

3. You decide to stay in college for an additional year or two, just for
the free internet access.

4. You start using smileys in your snail mail.

5. Your hard drive crashes. You haven't logged in for two hours. You
start to twitch. You pick up the phone and manually dial your ISP's
access number. You try to hum to communicate with the modem... and you
succeed!!!. You're so happy you begin to whistle like an leak in a
sunroof hatch.

6. You find yourself typing "com" after every period when using a word
processor.com

7. Your car has it's own home page.

8. You check your Email. It says "no new messages." So you check it
again.

9. Your phone bill comes to your doorstep in a box.

10. When you look for your wayward car manuals, you seem to find them 
beside the terminal more often than in the garage.


This is just for laughs... hope you got one or two
