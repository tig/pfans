It was kindly pointed out to me (privately) that I made a mistake in a
prior post in this thread. Therefore I take the liberty to post Chris
Whites E-mail, which much better explains what I would have liked to say
about clutch balancing - but didn't..            

" Each time you use the clutch the disk will be reoriented in the
'assembly'. Each item has to be balanced separately. The clutch disk and
pressure plate should be in balance as manufactured. I don't think any
one rechecks the balance while installing unless you specifically ask
(and pay) for that. I wouldn't worry about a Sachs or Porsche clutch. (I
still haven't hit 12,000 rpm!)"

and:

"If you are balance obsessed you can balance only the pressure plate.
The fly wheel should be balanced as a unit with the crank, rods and
pistons - that it why it is keyed to go on in one positon only"
 
Kudos to Chris White, for being polite as well as clever..
