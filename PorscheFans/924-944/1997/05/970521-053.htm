Hey dudes,

I've been unhappy with the Repco Metal Master pads for a while now so I tried
a bunch of different brands of pads, including Hawk, Porterfield and stock.
I did not have a chance to try the PFC Z-rated pads which people are speaking
very highly of.  What I decided to do instead of throw more money at the
problem was to investigate more about how brakes work, the technical end of
it anyhow.  I picked up a book written by Fred Puhn and took some advice in
there.  To say the least, it worked very, very well.  I did it to my car
a few weeks back and Paul did it to his last night and noticed the same
gain in performance.  All we did was slot the pads.  The Metal Masters don't
come with any slots and the pads just didn't feel right, they would fade
quickly, but because of heat.  It felt like the gases were causing the rotors
to become glazed.  I don't know exactly as I'm not an expert in brakes, but
the slotting has cured that "green fade" feel that I was getting.  Just take
two hacksaw blades attached to a hacksaw and cut down about 70% down the pad
height down the center.  Re-install, allow the pad to bed in to the grooves
of the rotor and feel the difference.

Here's a question for you guys.  When you go part throttle in your 951,
can you hit higher than 0.2bar (1.2bar on the dash) with throttle position.
In my car, I can get any boost level up to 1 bar with part throttle depending
on how much throttle I put in.  In Paul's car, it won't develope more than
0.2bar boost regardless of if the throttle is 5% open or 90% open.  As soon
as you go WOT (100% open) the boost goes up to the 1.0bar (2.0bar) that is
set by the chips.  We swapped chips over last night and no change so I
can only think it's either a problem with the cycling valve or perhaps that
just how they run???  My car has the drilled cycling valve so the computer
has very little control over the boost anymore so mine would no longer do
that if the stockers did that.

Farzaan.
89 951.
Maybe soon another 89 951 for racing :)
