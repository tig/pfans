        Hello;
I am new to the list today but in desperate need of advice.
A week ago I loaned my 87 944s to my son to drive a short distance.
when he returned he told me I should go out and listen to the engine.
He added that about 8 miles from home he started the engine and
the Oil preasure light came on. the guage showed 0 bar.
he said that about 5 miles from home (he didnt have sense enough to 
park it, Right?), The noise started. I briefly started the engine and 
confirmed his details. No oil pressure, lifters collapsed and rattling.
I had it towed to a repair shop whose owner I trust but who admits
to limited 944 knowledge. (mostly Mercedes and 911's).
He had recently rebuilt the head after a belt break.Prematurely in my 
opinion.(he had replaced the belt a very few thousand miles ago.)
Back to the story: He , not knowing what to expect called his 944
guru ( at a dealer I think). The guy told him two things to check.
One was the pump, the other the relief valve. He checked both ,
could detect no obvious problems. he restarted the engine, it had what 
appeared to be normal oil pressure and the lifters began to pump up.
He sai d " take it and put some miles on it and lets see what happens."
he also said he could not understand how it could have been the 7 or 8
miles without bearing damage but he can hear nothing nor can I. The 
only thing I can detect (trusting my memory of guages before the incident)
is that the car seems to run a quarter of a mark hotter and no loger pegs 
at 5 bar when cold. It starts cold at 4,4.5 bar and fals to the expected
1to 2 bar at idle hot. I have put maybe 100 miles on it since the incident.
Can any body guess what gives?
