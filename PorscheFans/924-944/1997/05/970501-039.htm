Yep.  The '88-'90 M3s had huge fenders, but they were too crude and looked
really tacked on.  I'd take the 944 any day, and I especially love it when
I see an all-white Supra--it looks like a white ceramic urinal.

My all-time fender award, however, goes to the Testarossa.  The rear track
is so much wider than the front--the ultimate stance, IMO, and by far the
nicest car I've driven (used to work at a dealership).  There is simply
nothing like the view from the side mirrors at those huge, upswept flanks
and the massive air intakes!

I must say that didn't like Porsche's marketing philosophy when I first
looked at the 968 brochure--there was no mention of the 944 at all.
Porsche had seemed to totally discount its recessed headlight cars--there
were frontal shots of 356s, 911s, 928s, a 959, heck-even a 956 racer!  A
"family photo" of sorts.  Sheesh, where was the 944??
