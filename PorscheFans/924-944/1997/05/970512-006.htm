P-fans:

Anders made some excellent comments in his recent response to my post on
engine detailing.  I had the dealer do the job because I was concerned about
these issues.  I hope he knew how to do it right, although of course it is
still possible that he could make mistakes in regard to removing necessary
lubrication.

Anders mentioned to consider what caused the dirty motor.  In my case, it
didn't look like the usual greasy grime.  Instead, the motor seemed to be
covered with a thick layer of dust, especially on the horizontal surfaces at
the top of the engine.  I suspect that this is just due to air coming into
the engine compartment carrying dust and debris with it.  Perhaps just hosing
down the motor would have been adequate, but I didn't want to do this for
fear of getting water someplace it shouldn't be.
