I have a 1979 924 that has the same problem with the turn signals, and
it seems to be rooted in the steering column assembly.  I haven't had
time to fully track down the problem, but I have replaced the stalk
assembly already, and the problem did not go away.  Probably, the short
precedes this assembly. As to the oil, my car leaks VERY slightly around
the oil plug, so this may be also be the source of your leak.  Trying to
be of help,

Brown (Is that really the original color?) 1979  924 -- Two months older
than its owner!
