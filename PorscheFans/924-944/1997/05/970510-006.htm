Hey, all this fighting is exciting!  OK, bloody, but exciting.  We =
should get P-fans to start a new group-we'll call it =
"title-match@porschefans.com."  We'll pit the best against the best.  =
This whole string is so hilarious I'm still reading it at four in the =
morning.  Hey, I honestly hope neither Farzaan's or JLPLee's feelings =
are hurt.  Now quit it or you're both going to bed without supper.

Sorry about the BW, I had a question here... Oh, would any of you ever =
so knowledgeable Pfans know anything about injectors?  I have an '82 =
924T.  My rebuild's almost done, and I've spent so much money on =
everything else I don't have enough to spring for new injectors right =
now(aah, the life of a student...). =20
Questions:
1)I'm pretty sure these aren't rebuildable by laymen.  Are rebuilds =
available?
2)Someone wrote about crap from a sitting fuel tank clogging the =
injectors.  Should I just leave the old ones on until I've run it?  =
Car's sat for 6 months now.
3)I drove the car ten miles to its current resting place.  Besides all =
the blown turbo and ring smoke, it ran fine (read fairly smoothly).  =
Maybe the old one are fine?  i.e. ain't broke=3Ddon't fix?
4) someone told me these are same as 930 Turbo. True??

Thanks.  BTW, this isn't my address (I'm house sitting).  I'm at:
lazarus.david_ross@gainesville.va.gov (long, huh?)

Lastly, somebody out there needs to sell me a 951 intercooler core.  If =
you don't, I'm gonna write nasty stuff to you on the list and spam your =
account.
