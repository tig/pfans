I may be wrong but it was my understanding that most cars with EFI have a
safety feature that shuts off the fuel pump if oil pressure drops too low
(as in zero).  I was told that this was to prevent the fuel pump from
feeding a possible fire/accident situation in which the engine has stopped
but key is still in the run position (and a fuel line might have been
ruptured).  Now with the DME, there are certainly more sophisticated ways
to accomplish this (i.e. RPM sensor reads zero).  However, is it possible
that DME looks at oil pressure too, and should the relief valve be stuck
open, insufficient pressure will develop for the DME to say 'yes' start?
