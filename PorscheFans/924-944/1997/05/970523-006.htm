This makes sense, because you can't just use a compressor to compress
the gas right up to the liquid stage, you have to compress right up to
it, and drop it over the edge by removing heat (through the condensor).

One more question, this one on the directly applied side of things: 

In working on the 77 924 yesterday, which has the aftermarket "PDP" A/C
system, I noticed that one of the pipes connected to the compressor has
broken out of the fitting, venting the system to the outside completely
(sometime in the past, before I bought it). Fixing this (if it's the
only problem w/ the system) should be relatively inespensive, but what
effect could having the system vented/open for a substantial period of
time do to the system? Is it likely to have damaged anything? Also, how
does one go about getting replacements for this aftermarket system
(since it's not factory)?

TIA...

Subject: Street rain tires for 1984 944

Hello 944 fans:

I was searching for the Porsche Owners Club and stumbled upon your site. I hope 
you don't mind me posing the following question to you.

Would any of you fans be able to suggest a good street rain tire for a 1985 
Porsche 944 with 15 inch wheels? It rains a lot here in Newfoundland so I would 
rather put my money into something that performs better in the wet than the 
dry. Do you know of any way to get an 'official' recommendation from the 
Porsche company as to what they would recommend?

The car has its original 15 inch wheels and I don't want to change them but I
am finding that there are very few 215-60-15 tires available with a V or Z 
rating that are optimized for driving in wet conditions. I do not want to buy a 
'4-season' tire as the car is stored for the winter anyway, which in 
Newfoundland terms means from mid-November to mid-May, that is, until the salt 
is all gone from the roads.

I need to purchase 4 new tires within the next few weeks as I am driving to 
Chicago and back leaving June 20th. Buying tires in the US is a possibility but 
I'd rather have the new tires on before I leave.

Many thanks for your help,

Regards,
Chris
