Naweed,  

Yeap I know the kind you're talking about it.Man with a gun ( extension
of his p....). I would like to see this guy do his jib in UK, at the
time that most of the bobbies had no guns... Unfortunatly they have no
people skills whatsoever over this side of the Atlantic. Nothing more
than cowboys hot shots.... It's sad because we generalize, and in the
mist of several bad cops, we still find really great ones, but due to so
many bad  confrontations, the rap sheet for them goes down. Anyway we
shouldn't be affraid to be stoped but after so many abuse of authority
that I've witnessed you should be concerned. 
Today comming to work, I had a Gwinnett Co cruiser flew over my car
doing 75 on a 55 zone... few miles latter we got on the interstate and
the speed was set to 65 and he still was going way over the limit this
time with a Biker ( also a Gwinnett Police ) doing the same in the rain.
Few miles latter this guy stops a car in traffic doing the same speed as
him ( detail this guy was not the only one 'cause several cars and
trucks were at the same speed). Now the question is... He's stoping
someone for speeding on the so called keep the safety on the road, but
who will enforce the enforcer, cause that piece of s... lumina is not
made for handling and he's more dangerous that those he's stoping ..
