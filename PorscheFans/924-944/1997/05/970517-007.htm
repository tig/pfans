The only way you could break the crank in your example is to somehow have
the "engine" (the rider) apply more *torque* than he or she normally would.
Since all the driveline parts are designed to take the maximum torque
output from the engine, you should not be able break any of the driveline
parts.  In fact, the only way I've ever heard of breaking driveline parts
is by increasing engine output without compensating downstream.

In the bicycle example, when a rider hits a hill and doesn't change to a
lower gear (maybe there isn't one, for example), the rider does in fact
increase their torque output by standing on the pedals.  This increase in
weight is applied across the lever arm (the pedal shaft which is offset
from the centerline), resulting in increased torque.  Unfortunately,
automobiles have no such means of adjusting their torque output on the fly.
As the amount of torque required increases, the engine will slow down until
it just finally quits (or you downshift).  That said, I will contradict
myself somewhat by saying that lower RPMs under high loads tends to rattle
the engine somewhat as well, but this has to do with the fact that
4-cylinder engines have non-overlapping firing pusles, which become more
noticeable at lower RPMs.

The point at which the engine makes its peak torque is usually the point of
highest efficiency as well, so you need to have a balance.  If I remember
right, the 944na makes peak torque between 3,000 and 4,000RPM, but
certainly sounds comfortable running at 2,500 or even less.  Most drivers
on this list are capable of judging when to downshift and to a large degree
it's personal preference, not mechanical.  But that's part of the magic of
the automobile, isn't it?  It appeals to different folks with different
ideas and accomodates most all of them.
