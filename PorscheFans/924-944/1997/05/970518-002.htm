Blake,

	My guess is that the rebuild shops probably make their own 
gaskets as opposed to porsche only selling to them. I could be wrong 
on this one, but it makes the most sense.

	I am glad you posted your dilemma as I was *just* about to take 
the fuel dist off of the wifes' '80 931 to clean it out. The car 
has not been run in a long time and the injection system seems to 
have gummed up some. Got it running after cleaning lots of little 
items as well as installing two new fuel pumps, for inside and 
outside the tank. But it is running REAL rich at the moment.

	Anyway, have you tried bosch directly? If you wish Monday I will 
check at a Bosch repair site here in houston for you. If I strike out 
there try Wrightwood racing, there claim to fame, among other things, 
is making gaskets for porsches, specifically for racing purposes. And 
I really doubt that the racing guys chuck the fuel dist every time 
they take it apart. There phone # is 805-385-7191, ask for Charlie 
Spiros. A really nice guy who has been around alot of the older 
racing water cooled porsches. He is located at 1401 Van Guard Drive, 
Oxnard, CA  93033.

take care,
