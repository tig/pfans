I haven't bled my brakes within the past 10 months, but I have observed a
similar phenomenon in my 951, except I can't remember which way the
engagement point has moved (toward or away from floor).  The car only gets
driven once a week while I'm away at school, so the car basically sits for a
few months at a time.  Every time I come home, I swear it engages either
higher or lower than before.  It could just be my imagination (since I
haven't physically confirmed the phenomenon by measuring), but does anyone
know if my clutch could really be "falling out of adjustment" like this?
