The simplest and neatest way to wire a radar detector is directly into the
dome (interior light) power.  The door switches the ground, so there is
voltage there all the time.  No wire cutting is necessary, just carefully
tuck the leads under a push on connector for power and ground (watch for
shorts!) Use a VOM or test light so you don't inadvertenly reverse wire
your detector and ruin it.  The wire can just snake out between the lens
and the headliner, and in my case, it is only about 4 inches or so to the
detector, and its completely invisible.

Don't worry about having switched power (unless you absolutely demand it). 
The detector draws so little power you can leave it on for weeks and not
drain the battery.  Also, you don't have to contend with the power on
sound effects that comes from many detectors every time you turn the key. 
I try to remember to turn mine off, but most of the time I forget.  Hasn't
stranded me yet. :-)  I do make a point of turning it off/removing it at 
night, as not to advertise its presence to thieves.
