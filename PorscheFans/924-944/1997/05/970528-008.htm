	I wanted to say thanks to everyone who gave me advice on
rebuilding and replacing the track control arms on my 86 951.  I've
decided that since the original arms have gone 122k miles without a 
problem until now I will stick with them when I go for a new set.
I know aluminum has a limited lifespan due to  microfractures and
fatigue, but hey, the things last 100k miles and you pay $400 with
labor to get each one replaced with new, and that does not seem too bad.
	I'm not going to be doing much racing (except autocrossing which
I'll take up next year with the SCCA) so I'm not going to worry about it.
	
	PS:  I've heard that for my year 951 that there were different arms
supplied with the sport suspension than with the standard.  I have to jack
up the car and check the numbers, but can someone confirm this?
