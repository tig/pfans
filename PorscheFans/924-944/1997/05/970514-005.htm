I had no idea that another functional Passport was plying the freeways in
a 944! My '84 944 has had the Passport in it from '85, still have the
receipt for $299 from CNMW. Last year, after a well-deserved 130mph ticket
(the cop was curious/confused enough to give me a ticket for 80mph!)  on
the deserted expanses of I-90 in eastern WA, where the Passport did not so
much as chirp, I finally ended my denial phase and stopped pretending that
the Passport detects much. Bought a Passport 5000 just before CNMW filed
for bankruptcy. Didn't realize how attached I'd grown to the Passport and
its familiar start-up "bleeeep" and red and green lights. Finally ended up
with an ingenious compromise: the 5000 sits on my front visor, and the
Passport is clipped to the rear panel covering the hatch bolts, pointing
to the rear!

Both are direct-wired, which gets rid of messy cords and makes them very
unobtrusive. Most cops will not lean low enough to see the detector stuck
to the visor, unlike the ubiquitous suction-cup mounted detector that
screams for a ticket. 

Start-up gets real noisy now, with the Passport's bleeps, the 5000's
bleeps, braps and chirps and the seat-belt chimes kicking in! I was
worried about supermarket doors blasting my ears off with the 2 detectors
falsing at the same time, but I had forgotten how small the car is. As
soon as it starts falsing, I can reach behind over the toy-seats and mute
the Passport. Good arm-exercise, and you have to conduct the whole
thing looking at the mirror so if I ever want to be a dentist I am set! 
The 5000 has an auto-mute.

Another curious feature of this setup, is that the 5000 gets a laser false
every time the radiator fans start-up! Just the one chirp, kinda useful as
a reminder to check the gauge. Of course the best part is, at night I have
the 5000's hi-tech LCD panel doing its work, and I still get to see the
familiar blinky lights of the Passport in my rear-view mirror!

sapphire metallic/black, 2 passports front and rear, no tickets since...

If anybody needs help with direct-wiring or wiring their old detector
rearwards in a completely functionally useless and aurally rewarding
move, I will be happy to help.
