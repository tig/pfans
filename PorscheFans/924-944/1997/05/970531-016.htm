Does your pump get power when you activate the washer stalk? If not than it
is an electrical problem. If its getting power than mess with the
pump/motor as follows:

I have managed to fix two of these (after I bought replacements though). In
both cases once the motors were oiled and spun freely - the problem was
with leaks at the pump gasket seal. When you take them apart you will
notice that the pump portion is a clamshell with internal gears and a
rubber gasket. If the gasket does not seat properly the pump will not be
able to draw liquid into the system.  Use some loctite permatex non
hardening gasket material before you put it together and that should cure
the pump.

You should test the pump draw before you connect it to the main lines so
that you can isolate the pump/motor problem from the check valves.  Also
make sure that the lines are tightly seated and or crimped on all of the
connectors otherwise air will get into the lines and the pump will have to
pump liquid all the way back from the bottle.
