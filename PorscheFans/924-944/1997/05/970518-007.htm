Hello,
	I have an '89 944 with some intermittent electrical problems.  The main instance is that sometimes when first driving the car, the radio doesn't work.  Actually, the radio comes on, and one can tune, fast forward the tape, etc, but there is no sound.  The equalizer doesn't come on.  Even with the eq turned on, the led's do not light up, so power must not be getting to it.  The times this has happened, I have tried the radio ten or so minutes later and it works.   When it's been broken, I have tried to wiggle the wires behind the unit to see if it's a loose connection to the speakers but this never fixes it.  Only time has solved it, temporarily.  
	I am not averse to taking the radio and eq out for examination...the only thing is, I can't figure out how to get it out!  Haynes is mute on the subject of radios.  I heard something about inserting nails into the four holes on the front of the radio to release it and I tried this to no avail.  What's the trick?  BTW, the radio and equalizer are the stock Blaupunkt models.  "Reno SQR" radio with BEA 90 eq.  Thanks much for your advice.

Benj.
