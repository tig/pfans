FR: Rick (87 924S)

Hey guys, I starting to become a mechanical hyperchondriac reading some
of this stuff you talking about regarding periodic replacements and
adjustments on what I would consider major items as well very expensive
items.  All this talk about cam-chain tensioners, and drive belts, etc,
is this something the average street porsche needs to have done every
"xyz" miles as routine or to be looked at when your noticing problems
and have to get it done.  OR am I just eavesdropping on conversations
between the "Speed Racers" and "Racer X's" among us that have to do this
type of stuff due to hard track driving?

My '87  924S  has about 65K miles on her and I'm thinking, based on what
I'm picking up on our Fans page, that I'm going to have to pull her all
apart and probably pay as much as I did for the car in the first place
just so I feel comfortable about driving it knowing that these chains
and belts are OK.  How often does this really need to be done and how
will you know when you think you need it done..

I love the car, so if I have to pay to make her right I don't have a
problem and will do it, but I'm starting to feel like my mother-in-law
that my car might have the hibee-jeebees, the giddy-gees, or the
achey-wakies...and that I need to take her to the doctors (in this case
the mechanic).  (Gee, this page is fun to vent on) So, gentlemen (and
those ladies among us), how often should I really check on this stuff
for just a street toy that doesn't really get driven too hard and should
I worry about this stuff at all until I develop some sort of symptoms.

I'm big on periodic and necessary maintenance, but to me that always
meant items like oil, filters, lube work, and windshield wiper
fluid...but cam-chains???  What's your advice on this?  Thanks, Rick
.
