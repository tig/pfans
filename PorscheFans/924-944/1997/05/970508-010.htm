Naweed,

If this is a factory mechanic working at a dealership, of course he's not
going to try and sell you non-factory approved aftermarket chips--that's
not the dealer's prerogative.  You've heard his side of the story, now go
around and ask the independant shops.  I've had a Weltmeister chip
installation in my 86 951 for almost two years with no problems at all.
I've owned the car for almost seven years, so you can see I waited a long
time before deciding on a chip.  There is a noticeable difference in
performance.  The decision to run a chip depends entirely on what you want
the car to do.  If you are going to run lots of track events you will need
to pay attention to the possible wear and tear--particularly on the head
gaskets--that the chip installation may cause.  Personally, I believe (as
many do), that the 951 engine is more than capable of taking the extra
power.  Some people even think that the 951, in stock from, did not realize
its full potential, and that it was almost literally de-tuned so as not to
overshadow the 911!?  It may just be another rumor, but there is tremendous
potential in that engine, as long as it is properly maintained and you are
prepared not to cut corners on service.  My car is almost totally street
driven, but the chip is invaluable--especially in 2nd and 3rd gear
acceleration. 100mph in 3rd is nothing.  On the open road, you have the
ability to pass a long line of minivans and sport utes with no drama at all
(not that I recommend this sort of thing).  Off the line accelerationwas
never stellar, so I save my clutch for the most part and use the extra
power in the mid and upper ranges.

Again, find as much information as you can and make your own decision as to
what you want the car for.  My car is tame compared to some others I've
seen.
