Hello Dave.

I'd be interested in knowing some good spots to go for 2-3 day trips in MD, VA,
& the DC areas.

I recently completed driving the entire Blue Ridge Mountain Parkway (over a
course of 3 days) going from the Smokey Mountain National Park near Tennessee
all the way up to the end in Virgina, not too far from Washington,DC.

My 951 was absolutely amazing on hundreds of miles of tight, twisty, hairpin
curves.  I think I was being watched from above because the entire trip was
made with a defective clutch master cylinder.  My mechanic told me that the
clutch and brake system are connected in this way, so I could have had a
possible failure.

I don't know if that is true or not, but it sure scared the heck out me and got
me to agree to get it replaced immediately!  Came close a couple of times to
being the world's first Porsche to go skydiving without a parachute, from
6500+ feet altitude, had it not been for my brakes to stop me!  Fortunately
though, my brakes did not fail me once.
