A few of you have asked for additional info. on testing I did yesterday w/
new chips in '87 951.

1)  Farzaan - the timing was done by myself.  Just a few weeks ago, after a
driver's ed event and subsequent autocross, I started looking at Nomex suits.
 I'm sure you understand.  That simple act, however, set my wife off on this
NO RACING kick.  (I had to tell her that the boost guage, taped on the
windshield on the outside w/ 200 mph tape, was a vaccuum guage I was using to
diagnose a "cold starting" problem).

Subsequently, I couldn't very well ask her to accompany me to gather data on
horsepower improver, including some 110 mph stretches on I-75.  For this
reason, I was running solo.  They way I timed was simple.  With a stopwatch
in left hand, I'd hold a steady rpm and then wham!  I'd punch the throttle,
and hit the start button at the same time.  I'd keep it floored until I hit
the desired rpm, then stop the stopwatch and shortly thereafter, let up on
the gas and simultaneously scan for police!

Granted, not the most scientific measurement, and results probably wouldn't
duplicate between different drivers, but I think it was very consistent.

Boost pressures - this is what was wierd.  Before chips I was showing, on a
brand new VDO boost guage (-30 to +15) 10 inches of max boost.  I thought it
seemed a bit low.  (1.68 bar)

New chips gave me 12.5 inches (1.8 bar).  I know there's some variance
between cars, DME's, KLR's, vaccuum lines, sealing washers, etc., but I was
surprised at the low readings.  The readings are supported, however, by the
factory guage as well.  Maybe my math is off.  Could you confirm for me, is
12.5 psi equivalent to 1.8 bar?

Running late, but we'll talk soon.
