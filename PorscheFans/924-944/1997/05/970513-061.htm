	Hey, Lee! It's been a super busy spring. I have some left over
	wax. I'm up for it if you are. Seriously. I can't make Parade but
	I will be at the Club Race at TWS. Will you? How about anyone
	else? Those Porschefans attending the Parade Club Race, please
	raise your mice. Maybe we can have a "porschefans contingent"
	or something...
