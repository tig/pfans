Hey again,

I had previously posted about a minor miss during acceleration in
my car. I have heard one or more of you guys refer to a problem
wherein the acceleration is "stepped" as opposed to being smooth.
This is very similar to what I experienced. The power came up in
many distinguishable little "surges," not one steady stream. I
replaced everything in the fuel system (except the fuel pump) as
well as the plug wires & cap / rotor with little improvement.
The last thing I could think of was the oxygen sensor. I didn't
expect much before I did it, but it cured this "step" thing once
and for all. $20.00 at Trak Auto, and it's fixed. 

But... now that I've lived with it a while I've noticed another
minor annoyance. Since I changed the O2 sensor, the car seems to
stumble MORE on acceleration when the car is cold. Is there any
reason why this should be? It definitely runs better now once the
engine is up to temperature, but I don't like wondering if I'll
make it out in front of that schoolbus first thing in the morning!
Just so you know, I'm not one of those who runs it up to 5000 rpms
as soon as I start it up.

Thanks,
