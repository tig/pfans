A newserver is (in principle) integrated in the Usenet. Usenet is the
place for all kinds of NG's (newsgroups), such as rec.autos.misc and
alt.autos.porsche just to name a few.

Just about any of man's weird, unusual or strange interests will have
its own newsgroup, just like the more universal ones, like cars,
computers and all kindd of hobbies.

This may sound like a good idea, but it have a few disadvantages too.

One is that your ISP (Internet Service Provider) generally does not
carry all newsgroups. Thats because some are very large, some are not
interesting and some are downright strange or untasteful. If your ISP is
not a commercial one, but a company or a university, it may even be
policy question to allow access to NG's in general, or even specific
ones.       

The other is that SPAM (this dreadful word) will usually be a big
problem if the NG is not moderated. The moderator(s) will have to look
into each and every post, to check that it is suitable for the NG in
question, so that will be a major task even if distributed over a small
group. Most NG's are not moderated, so they are infested with spam for
all kinds of Net stuff - even the more untasteful parts.     

A listserver (the mail-central of this list) is using email for
distribution instead of the Usenet news-server network. This is not as
efficient, at least in theory, but is probably a better way to cater for
our interests - as long as our host is willing to give us the recources.

Which leads me to say:

A big THANK'S to our list serve host. I feel a little ashamed to confess
that he/she is unknown to me... Therefore, step forward to be praised!
