I stand corrected, and thanks for the clarification!

We had a discussion about this some time back and we never came to any
definite conclusions other than at least the pre-87 cars apparently did not
have knock sensors.  Did Porsche maybe feel confident enough in their
computer maps to not bother with them, even on the Turbo models?  The fact
that you don't see one on your engine and that you know what to look for
makes me wonder if this isn't the case.  Regardless, let me know what you
discover.
