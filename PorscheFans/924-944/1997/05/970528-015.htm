Hey Anders, 

I didn't have the pleasure to visit Sweeden, but I bet you that the
officers over there a much more polite than those here in the US. ( We
have more respect for them and vice-versa and of course more astrindgent
gun laws ).
I remember speaking with officers from Germany, Switzerland,
Tchecoslovaquia, etc.. and they always been very very polite. The
Gendarmes in France would always salute and ask the regular questions
without the circus of lights and hand on holster....

In a nut shell, we don't know what we are missing, Autobahns, polite
cops, good beer and wine, since we lost it..:(((
