I do not know if the 993 or the 986 do this, but my 944S was a US model.  I 
believe even Peugots, Citroens did this, though I do not remember Lancias,
Alfas and the rest of the Italians doing it at least in their smaller cars.  The
Brits might have, but given that over the Lucas the king of darkness rules,
who would know even if they did have the feature :-)).  At any rate, this
is not a bug, it is a feature.
