I had the same thing happen to my 85.5 944 and it was not the DME.  I know
this won't make you happy to hear since you've already ordered the part,
**but the DME in your car is fine**.  If the car runs when you push-start
it, the computer is working OK.  Computers either work, or they don't.
Period.  And they almost never go bad in our cars.  I spent weeks and
months with this same problem and I still have my original DME.

After spending $$$ on all the electrical components (minus the DME itself),
I stumbled across an apparently little-known fact: the computer will not
fire the plugs if you don't meet a minimum starting RPM.  The reason my car
wouldn't meet the RPM, especially when cold, was a sticky oil-pressure
relief valve.  Not one of the mechanics I had look at the car or whom I
questioned was able to correctly diagnose the problem, so I'm not surprised
that yours missed it as well.  The valve is sticking because of old oil
cooler seals which allow water and oil to mix (creating a gooey mess) and
deposit themselves in the valve.  The valve sticks open, allowing
higher-than-usual oil pressures to flow throughout the entire engine and
causing a drag on the engine and starter motor.  It's not alot, but just
enough to keep the engine from firing.  That's why push-starting works--
you get way above the minimum RPM and the computer is more than happy to
start the car.

The original oil-pressure relief valve was a three-piece design which has
been superceded by a one-piece design (available as a retrofit for our
cars).  If your situation is like mine, you either recently had your oil
cooler seals replaced or are due to have them replaced soon, as witnessed
by the floating gunk in your radiator overflow tank.  Replace the oil
cooler seals, update to the latest valve (do NOT try to reuse the original
three-piece valve; there's a long story there), and the problem disappears.

I feel badly for you since you're now out $$$ in diagnostic fees and
possibly stuck with a DME which you may not need.  Please let us know how
it turns out!
