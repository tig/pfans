Subject: Inexpensive fix for alloy control arms

Another way to deal with the expensive problem of bad alloy control arms
is to not even use them.  If originality is not your thing, go back to
the steel arm that was used on the 924/944 with virtually no problem. 
The 19mm ball joint fits right on, the mounts are the same for the
bushing, etc.  New steel arms can be bought for about $40-50.  Used arms
can be had for about $25.  Get a used 944 arm and the lower sway bar
mount.  They will bolt right on and not break, but go ahead and replace
the ball joint for good measure.  For track/race events, I always weld
on metal plates to the arms along the seams and around the sway bar
mount and they are bulletproof.

.... We immediately replaced our aluminum arms with the
steel, never had a failure, while most of the eight 944 teams did
experience failures.  Those arms are still good today on our ex-Firehawk
944 race car, even after years of city driving.


Would this fix work on an 86 951 or is there any suspension geomentry change?
