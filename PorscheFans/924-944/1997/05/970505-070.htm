I am just completing some serious updates to the suspension of my 951,
bringing it close to S specs. This has included the dreaded replacement of
the rear torsion bars (which required dropping the enntire rear suspension),
and the much more benign replacement of the front A-arms, shocks, brakes,
spindles, springs, bushings and sway bar. Now for a question I can't answer
by just referring to my factory manual  - BECAUSE THEY WON'T PRINT ANY!! -
sorry, no frustration there, my keyboard just got away from me for a minute.
This list is much better than a manual anyway. Here's the questions:

1. After replacing the front tie rods, I am having a hard time re-tightening
the lock nuts which attach the tie-rod end to the spindle (this is not the
castle nut on with the kotter-pin used on the non-S tie rod end). The ball
joint of course just spins in the socket, so I can't tighten the thing. There
must be a simple way to tighten the nut without wrecking the boot by trying
to wedge a vice-grip in there - any hints for me?

2. I replaced the sway bar, and tightened down the lock nut on top of the
bushing which sits on the a-arm. I am confused as to how tight to turn the
nut (the tighter I turn it, the more compressed becomes the bushing, which I
assume is only good up to a point). 

Any help much appreciated.
