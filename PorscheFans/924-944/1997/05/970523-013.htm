There are two schools: low pressure and high pressure. I was formerly a low
pressure devotee (<25 lbs), but I have been convinced that higher pressure
is better. At my last drivers ed, I started with 32 lbs front and 30 lbs
rear and did not touch the tires all day. It stuck like glue and I didn't
get the "groove of doom".

Based on some comments made by others on the list, I ordered shaved R-1's
for the rears (the fronts were not replaced). After 1 track day with 2
drivers, the rears are not showing significant wear. I must admit I was
skeptical, but I'll probably continue buying them shaved.
