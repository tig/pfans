Hi Fred,

> 2 weeks ago I got my first Porsche, an 86 944 turbo with 130k miles.

Congratulations! Welcome to the club. You should seriously consider
joining the PCA. It's a great place to meet people, and enjoy your car.

The compression ratio is lower than on a normally aspirated car, but
that statement is not true. If the timing belt breaks, your valves 
and pistons can have an unfortunate meeting.

> true?  (The timing belt was last done at 100k.  How much time does a

I don't know how long it would take. Around here, most places get about
$300 to replace the timing and balance belts.

The factory gauge is not that accurate. Full boost should be 1.8 bar at
about 4000 rpm, and then it bleeds down to 1.5 at redline. Adding a
chip will increase the boost, most chips raise pressure to 2 bar.

You can get a decent idea of how much clutch material is left if you
put the car up on jackstands and measure the travel in the clutch release
lever. Find the clutch slave cylinder (it's above the starter). To the
driver side of the bellhousing is an inspection hole. It should have
a 1/2" plug in it, but I have never seen the plug. Anyway, if you look
in the inspection hole as someone steps in the clutch pedal you will be
able to see the clutch release lever move. The lever should move XXmm
when the clutch is new, and if it moves YYmm then it's worn out (my
shop manuals are at home, I think XX = 18mm and YY = 24mm, but that's
just from memory).

From what I've seen and heard, most 944 clutchs don't wear out, they
break. That is, either the rubber center of the damping springs break.
When I replaced my clutch at 54K, there was PLENTY of friction material
left. Two of the small springs were broken and interferred with the
clutch release.

So, I would say that you are better off slipping the clutch than just
releasing it. Since I now know how hard it is to replace a 951 clutch,
I am very nice to my clutch, and I hope it's nice to me. I don't do
any drag race starts, and at the track I make my shifts fairly slowly
and very deliberately.

As my friend Henry says "When you know how hard it is to fix, you
tend to take care of it."

Enjoy the car,
Barry Lenoble

Well, I've been reading this list for a few months now and have gotten
lots of useful information from all of your help, so now it's time to give
some back. 
	Tomas, I just fixed what is a simular problem in my 944 this last
weekend. What the problem ended up being was poor contact on the small
sensors located by the roof rails.. What had happened on mine was that the
leather covering that small piece in the ceiling that hides the power
mechanics had come off and was getting between the contacts.. What I did
was use DAP contact cement to put the leather back where it should be and
then cleaned the whole mechanism with WD-40.. It's a real simple procedure
which require you to remove the 5 screws that hold that piece up, reattach
the leather(if nessicary), hold a towel up to the mechanisms and spraw a
bit of WD-40 into them.. Be sure that you don't spray too much because you
don't want it dripping all over everything when you take the towel away...
As soon as I reassembled everything, the roof worked fine, and I've taken
it off everyday since.. :) 
	Hopefully this will help, I tried everything else with mine and
that seemed to be the only thing that worked..
