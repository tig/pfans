does anyone out there have a short shift kit for their 944?? in addition i have 
seen plenty for the 944 turbo but ony a few for the 944 itself, since the tranny 
is the same i cant see why they wouldnt work on both of them? 

last night on discovery channel there was a great show about fast cars, one was 
a ferrari f-50 the other a 911 TT and a callaway corvette! it was awesome!! i 
dont think i have ever wanted a ferrari as bad as i did when that f-50 roared 
like an f-1 car!!!!!! i have decided that i must at some point in my lif own an 
f-1 race car!!!! i just wanna start it and let the engine rev a little, not to 
mention the love of the 6 speed sequential gearbox!!!!!!!!

oh yeah while i am rambling does anyone know of a single wiper conversion as 
mine are in need of replacement and i love the single wiper look.
