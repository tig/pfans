	I have been noticing that my 1-2 shift is very slow. 1-3 is ok as is
3-2 and 3-1. The problem is most noticeable on the first shift of the
day when the box is still cold. About 50% of the time there is no
problem it just slides across the gate smoothly. I dismissed it as
character until Sunday when I drove a 88 951. It was very smooth and
light on all shifts, although the centering spring was much much lighter
than my car. I don't abuse my gearbox and all the mechanics tell me what
wonderful condition its in with no noticeable faults, stonechips aside.
Have I shagged a syncro or is this a case of lubing the linkages ?
Please reply to me personally & the list as I don't seem to be getting
the list at the moment.
