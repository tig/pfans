PorscheFans,

can anyone help me out with the following please:

1. On very rare occassions when I have the cabin air fan motor blowing, with
   or without A/C running, I can smell petrol.  I have seen the discussions
   about oil possibly leaking into the coolant, but is what I am experiencing
   totally unrelated and different?  My coolant reservoir is a dirty green
   color and is very hard to see into it.  At cold, the coolant level is
   just at the "min" mark.

2. On very rare occassions, my digital clock will not come on.  I turn on my
   hazard lights, then off, and then the clock works fine.  This is probably
   a loose wire in the clock, right?

3. When I put my car in reverse after closing my sunroof completely, the
   sunroof motor makes a clicking sound, and I am able to close my roof
   even further.  Why does it do this?  Also, sometimes when I open my roof,
   it stops at the fully extended position, but other times, after fully
   extending, the sunroof motor continues to run.  Why is it doing this?
   It never occurs when I'm closing the roof.

4. On very rare occassions (only 3 times so far), I have turned on my lights
   and the headlights will not pop up.  I just barely touch the manual knob
   on the headlight motor, and then the lights pop up.  Does this mean that
   my motor is starting to wear out or something.  I looked, but didn't see
   any loose wires, so what else could cause this?

5. When I get a compression test done at the dealership, should they do
   any other service at that time since they will have the car?

Thanks for any info.  None of these problems are major (I hope) but I just
want my Porsche to be perfect, that's all!
