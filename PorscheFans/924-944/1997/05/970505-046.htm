Hello Porsche fans:

	I have a collection of new and used parts off my 951. These parts are in very good conditions.

For Sale:

RIMS AND TIRES
(2)  Front 8.5 X 17 O.Z. Racing Fittipaldi 3 pieces Forged rims Factory polished, perfect
(2)  Front on 255/40/17 Dunlop SP8000 90% tread left
(2)  Rear 10.0 X17 O.Z. Racing Fittipaldi 3 pieces Forged rims Factory polished, perfect
(2)  Rear on 275/40/17 Dunlop SP8000 90% tread left
(4)  Porsche crest gold/colored center (original)

The Rims and tires were on my 944 Turbo, they will fit all late model 87+ 944/968/928.
The rims were custom build for me by O.Z Racing of Italy to have correct offset.  
These are the largest sizes rims on that would fit the 944 Turbo without tire rub even with lowered suspension and big brakes.  
In addition, the center cap were machined out to accepted Porsche center cap (also included)  They are 100% perfect in every way.

The tires have 90% tread life left, the tread measured 5.7 - 6.0 millimeters in height.  They are mounted and high speed balanced.

I had paid $4100 for all options and I am asking $2800 for the set, but will consider offer or trades+$
