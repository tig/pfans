With regard to the talk about the addition of a 944 spoiler to the 924, 
I did just this approx. 7 years ago when I first purchased my '80.  

I drilled into the metal frame and attached the spoiler with the "split" 
nuts that came off the spoiler for the sides and used screws (retapped 
the metal within the main part of the tail) for the main portion.  This 
has held up fine.  You can find the 944 spoilers much more easily used 
as there are more of 'em.  I think thieves break the rear windows of our 
babies in an effort to steal them and leave the spoilers to be sold- 
this is how I found mine.  

One caveat to the 'drilling installation method' (and I am somewhat 
embarassed about this).  Be careful with the drill!!!  A small side load 
on the glass while drilling SHATTERS the glass and renders the 
owner/installer very upset...I know, it happened to me and I bore the 
brunt of it for some time afterwards.  

Nonetheless, I persevered and won what with my big Beaver tail and 
all...
