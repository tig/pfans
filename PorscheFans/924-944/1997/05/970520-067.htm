I've about 800 mi on my S-O2s on a 90 944 S2 (twisty cabriolet).
Dry cornering is amazing -- I scared myself the first time I drove  
it hard on
the street (the car used to understeer more at the lateral acceleration
being requested, so I squeezed the throttle some more and the nose
still held on!).
I can feel the car much better than with the Comp TA VR4(f)/ Comp  
TA ZR(r)
that came from the PO.  The S-O2s are supposed to
be more forgiving near the limit than comparable tires (according to
Tire Rack), and hence good for a novice like me!

Haven't had them out in the wet yet.

Can't comment on that - my car is street/auto-cross only at the moment
(Anyone got a free rollbar so I can "test" my S-O2s at the track?).

The shops DO rave about these, and the manager of the shop came out
after I had mine fitted to make sure I was happy etc.  (guess they
don't sell too many)

They're pricey.

Richard - have you had them long enough to comment on wear?
