If anyone has bugged the list about these issues, it would be me... I asked
similar questions, and I basically got the "don't fix it" response.

I think there are two ways to check the water pump.

1. Squeeze the upper radiator hose while it running... you should feel
water trying to surge through your squeeze (use a towel- the hose gets
kinda hot).

2. Supposedly it will get noisy before it dies. I rekon you would need to
act quickly.

I don't know if it's just me, but I'm quite the little gauge watcher... I
keep my eyes on the oil pressure and water temp gauges a lot, and I would
know pretty quickly if I was dealing with an abnormal situation.

I have no personal experience, but I have heard the rebuilds are not all
that great, especially if you factor in the hell that is replacing the
thing the twice. This may be a situation where twice the price is worth it.

I opted not to replace my front seals. They seemed in good shape. No leaks.

On the oil cooler, I have first hand experience... the job is annoying.

Asumming you have an NA 944- I think turbo exhaust is super evil to remove,
involviong the pulling of the exhaust studs.

Everything you need is somehow guarded by the chassis frame or the exhaust
studs. You can barely get at the thing to clean it properly. Lots of
uncomfortable positions as you try to clean some obscure section of the oil
cooler block. This gets you going, and you want to clean that whole side of
the block. You kinda have to do all this, since, when you take the oil
cooler off, this huge mess of coolant and oil just dumps out. Two crappy
nights is my experience. The replacement job is pretty easy, the cleaning
part sorta bit ass. The oil-cooler replacement seal kit are only $38 though.

My recommendation here: if your coolant is clear or a clean version of
whatever color it's supposed to be in the expansion tank, the oil cooler is
probably fine. The first manifestation is a beige goo in the expansion
tank. Check it weekly if you are worried about it. My car drove for a
couple of months with no apparent ill side effects with a leaky oil cooler.
I should have fixed it sooner than I did, since the goo mess was simply
terrible, but the car did not seem to mind. I heard that your oil-pressure
relief valve or the t-stat may get blocked, but I never had that problem,
and I probably put 2k miles on the car in this condition.
