Repost:  I think the mail server ate this up yesterday so I'm re-sending this
         out for the digest members.

Hey dudes,

It's time again for a race report.  Yesterday was Regional #1 of the CACC
Solo series held at Tradex in Abbotsford by BCMA.

We had quite the Porsche turnout.  At some times during the day, the car
lineups looked like it was a PCA event!  I recall one run where we
had Paul's 89 951, Darren's 87 951, my 89 951, then Harry's 89 911, Pat's
96 911TT, Rich's 86 951, Tim's 88 951S and Wes's 91 S2 all lined up together,
all by chance.

The course was quite nice, but somehow unfulfilling.  It was open and smooth,
but it just didn't flow for whatever reason (perhaps even the driver!).  Even
though we were all out in full force, the Porsche contingent just weren't
up to their normal standards at this event.  Wes, who is usually FTD in his
S2 was slower than Pat's 911TT running on street tires.  Even Paul in his
89 951 beat Wes (Paul was running on Kumho race tires, Wes was running R1
rubber).  I'll go into the numbers below.

Our entire class almost runs together.  Paul and Wes are running Pax this year.
Paul is running in a class called A/SS (no jokes please!), which is between
A/S and A/SP in the US SCCA events.  Wes is running in A/S.  Myself, Rich,
Darren, Pat, Harry and Tim are running A/SS normal.  All of our first
runs were taken in the wet.  All of the times were pretty good for the wet.
Wes and Pat DNF'ed their first runs.  I was actually in the lead after the
first run in A/SS.  The second run was where all the best times were mostly
had.  Pat ran a blistering 52.6 on STREET tires (S-02) in his 96 911TT.
Have you seen one of these things go?  They are absolutely amazing!  I
ran a 56.4 (I was running on Dunlop SP8000 street tires), but nicked a cone
while I was sliding through the slalom.  These cars are really tail happy
on street tires.  Wes DNF'd his second run too.  Rich ran a 55.0 but got
a DNF also.  Harry in his 89 911 ran a very nice 54.0 clean, which put him
firmly into second place in A/SS behind Pat in his TT.  Tim ran a 55.8 on R1
rubber which put him into 3rd place with me sitting in 4th, ahead of Darren
and Rich.

On the third run, it was starting to rain again lightly.  Wes went out and
put in a clean conservative 53.0 in his S2.  There was at least another second
left in Wes's car, but he did the smart thing and took it easy and got a 
registered time.  Paul went up and clicked off a 52.9, but even he was 
not driving to his potential.  There was a 51.x time in his car.  Rich went
out and ran 55.9 but nicked 2 cones giving him a 59.9.  Darren went out and
ran a 59.x, but nicked a cone or two putting him behind Rich.  Tim went out
and ran a 56.1 clean, slower than his previous run of 55.8.  The track was
getting a bit slicker as the times went slower.  Pat, in his TT unplugged his
ABS to see if he could go quicker.  He ended up sliding past the first corner
and DNFed.  Harry, who was in 2nd place in A/SS ran slower than his 54.0
so no change in the top 3 positions yet.  Then I ran, I made a massive mistake
coming into the stop box and almost slowed to a crawl and had to get back
on the power and entered the stop box going really slow.  I ran a 55.5 though
on the Dunlops, which was good enough to take 3rd place away from Tim in his
R1 shod car, yeah!  The car had at least another second left in it, if I
wouldn't have screwed up the end (would've, could've, should've!).

So, anyhow, by the end of the day, the times were as follows:

A/SS normal
Car		Driver			Time	Tire				Place
96 911TT	Pat Ma			52.6	Potenza S-02 18" Street	1st
89 911		Harry Dether		54.0	BFG R1 16" Race		2nd
89 944T	Farzaan Kassam	55.5	Dunlop SP8000 17" Street	3rd
88 944TS	Tim Stark		55.8	BFG R1 16" Race		4th
86 944T	Rich Hoffman		59.9	Dunlop SP8000 17" Street	5th
87 944T	Darren Foo		61.0	Dunlop SP8000 16" Street	6th

(BTW - Darren did a fabulous job for being a novice.  He'll soon be knocking
 down the more experienced guys like Rich.)

Pax (Porsche only)
Car		Driver			Time	Tire				Place
91 944S2	Wes Shew		53.0	BFG R1 16" Race		2nd (A/S pax)
89 944T	Paul Buchmann		52.9	Kumho 16" Venturacer	7th (A/SS pax)

As you can see, the A/SS pax index is not very favourable for Paul, so for
the remainder of the season, we will be swapping computers in his car with
factory units and putting the boost bolt back to stock.  This way, he can
run under the A/S index which is the same as Wes.  In this particular event,
the boost made no difference, you never got on full boost anywhere, and Paul
would have walked away with 2nd place or maybe even first in Pax.

Anyhow, next event is May 25th at a very bumpy, small lot.  I've never done
well there, but this year, I'm gonna kick some butt!  (I've found that
self-confidence makes a big difference on your times) :)

Hope you enjoyed reading this.

Farzaan.
89 951.
