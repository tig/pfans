Good price.  If the work was done properly, there shouldn't be a problem. 
You might want to ask how the timing belt broke - was it due to ignoring
the adjustment/replacement interval, or an unfortunate failure?  Take a
look at the interior and exterior of the car to see if it shows pride of
ownership and good care.  The 89 NA 944 is unique in that it is the last
year of production for the 8V 944, and it has the 2.7, which was only
produced for that year.  The additional HP and torque can be definitely
be felt compared to the 2.5 liter NA cars. 

Be sure to get an independent inspection, and print out the 944 FAQ and go
over the car from top to bottom.  This will inform you of the 944 weak
spots to examine, and give you an idea of what you will need to invest to
get the car up to your standards. 

If you get it, give us the report!

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L black/Burg.
