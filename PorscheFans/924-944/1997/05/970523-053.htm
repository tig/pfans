Living in CT where detectors were ilegal for many years, I can
understand your frustration.  If you are just passing through there
probably isn't a lot you can do, but if you live in VA or metro DC, just
play the game.  During the "dark days" in CT, all my cars had built in
detectors.  Non issue, and they are always on.

In fact, it was kind of an advantage.  Since detectors were illegal, the
police didn't bother with stealth devices like instant on, VASCAR, etc.
They all used nice noisy x band you could detect a mile away.  Now that
detectors are legal, all the jurisdictions are investing in Laser,
VASCAR, etc.
