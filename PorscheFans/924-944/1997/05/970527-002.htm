problem is to get the fuel pressure gauge and follow the proceedures in
the Porsche shop manuals.  Another excellent resource is How to keep
your
VW Rabbit Alive book.  It has an excellent chapter on CIS fuel
injection.
I was able to make up a test gauge with an old Rabbit fuel injector and 
line.  What you have to eliminate is the Fuel accumulator, the Fuel 
distributor, the control pressure regulator, or the fuel injectors.  All
of these parts are $$$ so the gauge is probably a good investment.  If
you would like details on how I made my gauge e-mail me direct.  Good
luck!
