HOW TO REPLACE FRONT DAMPERS

Fresh from memory - with oily hands:

Haynes give a reasonable procedure for removing the struts. That can be
followed and covers basically all you need to know. The following
changes may be contemplated: 

Dismount the brake calipers, two 19 mm bolts, to make the work a bit
easier. I also sprayed a liberal amount of rust solvent on the
strut-to-hub clamp. Do remember to paint a marker on the upper bolt to
be able to coarsely realign the camber - it will be tricky otherwise.

The four bolts (13 mm) on top of each schock tower was loosened a little
before work started in earnest down below. The bolts that hold the strut
have 17 mm bolt heads and 19 mm locknuts. They may be very stubborn and
'dry' so good tools may be necessary, especially a breaker bar, a
ratchet and good quality sockets. After removing the 19 mm nut, try to
rotate the lower bolt with a 17 mm socket and a breaker bar. If they are
so tight as they were on mine, they will need more than that. I free'd
them with a swift hammer blow, but that is not the recommended way to do
it. 

Now, we are approaching what Haynes say 'should be left to a competent
workshop'. 

Take the complete strut, and but it in a vice or similar. Attach the
screw-in claws, two to a spring and start compressing the spring. This
is obviously a critical part of the job, not because it is tricky, but
because the spring will be loaded with considerable power when
compressed, and potentially dangerous. I recommend two double clawed
compressors on each spring, three if they are of the simpler one claw
type. I managed with two simple ones, however.  

After compressing the spring 5-7 cm, the spring will be fully movable
and not bind into the spring cups at all. Then, the large 22 mm nut can
be released. This is achieved by counterholding it with a 7 mm allen key
(exactly, 7 mm is NOT a standard dimension). I managed with vice-grips
on the shaft and a 22 mm socket, but I was going to discard the old one
anyway. To do it right, use the allen key and a 22 mm ring spanner.  

From the top there will be a anodized cup, a bearing mounted in a rubber
holder and a spring cup - all will come loose after releasing the 22 mm
nut. The bearing cup has a detachable rubber part on top of it, it may
come loose. 

Then, carefully lift out the compressed spring, and put it away for a
while. 

Clean and lubricate the bearing/bushing holder, and remove all residue
from the rubber parts. They will probably be OK as mine were OK after
125 K miles. Remove the rubber block and the dust shield from the shock
shaft and clean them too. 

Then, its time to take out the innards of the damper. Unscrew the 'lid'
from the damper top (where the shaft enters the tube. You will se some
threads there. There is a special tool (of course) but the lid can be
removed by a hammer and a steel drift. Unscrew it half way, and rise the
strut to a upright position. The shock contains oil, so have rags handy.
Open the lid, pull out the innards carefully and pour out the oil. Clean
the empty strut with degreaser, but no need to do to much of a job with
that. 

Now, take your precious Koni insert, and put it in the empty strut. Koni
recommends putting some coolant fluid (a little - there is not much
room!) to facilitate better cooling. I used a little engine oil because
I am more concerned with corrosion than cooling, but do put a little
fluid in, because the air gap will not be any good for either problem.
There will only be three or four tablespoons of oil or glycol needed. 

Time to put the lid on. Screw it on hand thight and then make it real
tight with the hammer and drift method. It is crucial that the insert is
really secure in the strut, so make sure that this is done. It is also
crucial that there are a few thread windings left when you have made
that good job of tightening it. There is a spacer in the kit, if there
is too much room left in the strut for the insert. It is covered pretty
good in the Koni instructions.

Replace the rubber block and the dust shield. Then put the compressed
spring back on, then the top spring cup, then the bearing holder, then
the top cup. Use the new nuts that comes with the Konis and do not
forget the spring washer, albeit there was none on the original...

Now, there is another way to counter hold the shaft, as the strut has a
flat for a spanner instead of a 7 mm allen key hole. 

If there is no loose parts left, except for a 22 mm old nut, and
everything looks the way it should (compare with the other strut...)
then, start unwinding those spring compressors. Make sure that the
spring ends seat in the dents in each spring cup.

Proceed to strut nr two and repeat.

When putting them back in, cover all bolts with cupper grease and follow
the procedure in Haynes. Do use new nuts. A alignment is probably a good
thing to do, but if you have been careful, it is only the camber that
have been disturbed and it will not be much off.    

What tools do you need ?

22 mm 'ring spanner' and 7 mm allen key.
17 mm and 19 mm ring spanner and/or sockets
13 mm ring spanner or socket
Breaker bar, hammer, drift
Two double clawed spring compressors
Rust solvent, 1/4 of a quarter of antifreeze or oil

What to get from the spare parts dept:

New nuts for the lower fastenings (4)
Packing piece/sealing ring between strut and strut tower.

Time: I t took me two days (but I painted the struts). Actual time for
replacing the struts, say, two hours per side - assuming no frozen bolts
and sufficient tools and/or ingenuity...
