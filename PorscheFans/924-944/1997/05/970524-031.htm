I live in South Florida year round and so I believe I am qualified to
comment here.  I have driven an '85 944 down here for the last 10 years and
we do get some pretty brutal summers.  The only time I ever had engine
heating to the degree you state was when one of my fan relays went bad,
preventing the fans from coming on at full speed (with the A/C on).  The
fan electrics would be the first thing I would check since it seems you
have already checked the radiator/coolant level (be sure that the radiator
passes the flow test).  When you put on the A/C (which I assume you do,
most of the time) both fans should come on and will make quite a racket
(with hood open).  If only one comes on or they both seem to be moving
slowly (and are quiet), this could be your problem.  I did install the fan
switch which lowers the temp at which the fans come on (when A/C is off). 
This does help but it really only applies to when you have the A/C turned
off.  When A/C is on, both fans come on and should stay on.  You did not
mention if the problem is greatest in traffic and do things cool down once
you get moving?  If so, this would also point to the fans.  When every
thing is working properly, the 944 cooling system does a very good job in
hot weather, in my experience.  Good luck.
