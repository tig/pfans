Hi, Tom!

I don't know how bad are roads at your area, but I know that here in =
Estonia the roads are very bad, but I still bought used 16" BBS RS =
3-piece wheels for my -84 944 2-3 months ago. I haven't had problems and =
they really look great. You just have to watch that you ain't driving =
with low pressure in your tires. The second plus is that the 3-piece =
wheels are extremely low-weighted (BBS's certainly are!) and they could =
even give a little more performance to your car.
