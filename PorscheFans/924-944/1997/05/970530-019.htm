Hey, P-Fans, here's a totally trivial and completely superficial topic. Has
anyone tricked out their weekend warrior with a racing stripe (perhaps
removable) for their track appearance? Seems like most of the 911 and 914
folks love to do this, but, in constrast, the 924/944/968 crowd is
typically very understated.  I'm not saying this is bad.  In fact it's cool
that the water-cooled crowd shows up with stock paint jobs and quiet stock
exhaust systems and proceed to out-lap a lot of the extroverts.  But I've
got a metallic blue S2, and was thinking that a big white racing stripe
down the middle of the car would make it look like a mini-Viper.  And I'm
sure it would improve my lap times, too. 

Jeez -- guess I've got too much time on my hands these days.
