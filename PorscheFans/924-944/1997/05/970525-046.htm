Fair enough.

No, you didn't.  I was the one who suggested the idea about the fuel
pump drawing too much power, but it would only apply to a cold engine
being started, not a warm engine which is running.  See below for an
explanation of the warm engine on three cyliders which you have
observed.

I have dug deeper into the information that I have and discovered that
pinching off the return line should not kill the engine due to fuel
pressure alone since the fuel pump itself contains a pressure relief
valve.  In fact, pinching off the return line is the documented way to
test the fuel pressure regulator (and related components).  My source
is "Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management" by Charles O. Probst,
SAE.  Page 11 of Chapter 4 states:


<paraindent><param>right,left</param>"If system pressure tests do not
show the 0.5 bar pressure drop with the vacuum line connected, check
the vacuum line for leaks.  If the line is sound, the regulator is
faulty.


"If system pressure is low in both parts of the test, the regulator
could be returning too much fuel or the fuel pump may not be delivering
properly.  You can pinpoint the problem by pinching off the return line
as shown in Fig. 3-7.  Do this slowly to avoid a sudden pressure surge
that could ruin the gauge.  If the gauge shows 4 bar (59 psi) or above,
the fuel-pump relief valve is working, so the regulator is faulty.  If
the pressure did not rise, there is a problem with fuel delivery, which
should be checked as described in 3.3 Fuel Delivery.


"If system pressures are too high, temporarily remove the fuel pressure
regulator return line.  Attach a short hose to the pressure regulator
outlet and direct it into an unbreakable container.  Run the system
pressure test again.  If pressures are now correct, then the fuel
return line is blocked.  If pressures are still high, the regulator is
faulty.

</paraindent>

This said, I did come up with a possible answer as to why the injectors
stop clicking.  You described a situation where three injectors would
run but four would not.  It took me a while, but I think I finally have
an explanation which fits the symptoms.


When the engine is warm and you close off the return line, the fuel mix
gets rich.  What happens next?  The computer tries to compensate when
the O2 sensor starts going towards the rich side.  But the way it
compensates is important.  The computer tries to lean out the mixture
to bring the combustion properties within specified limits by reducing
the amount of fuel injected.  It does this by shortening the pulse time
(since the pressure is fixed).  In an extreme case where the fuel
pressure goes very high, the computer shortens the pulse time to such a
point that the magnetic field doesn't have enough time to move the
injector pintle, and that's why the clicking stops-- the pulse is just
too short.  At idle, the combined open and fire pulse takes only about
10 milliseconds.  That's doesn't leave much room from which to start
cutting back.  Alternately, the DME may just decide to shut the whole
thing down, which you suggested in a previous post.  I only mention
that the engine must be warm because the engine runs in open-loop mode
until the O2 sensor warms up.


So why do three cylinders run and not four?  It's the equivalent of
false air, except this is on the exhaust side.  The fourth cylinder
isn't introducing any fuel into the exhaust system and is in fact
permitting pure air.  This air brings the average mixture that the O2
sensor sees back into a zone that the computer recognizes as "normal"
and the engine continues to run (albeit poorly).


In short, my first theory about not enough power to run everything
certainly doesn't apply to the warm engine dying under the conditions
you have observed.  This idea seems to fit the situation much better--
in effect, the computer is doing exactly what it's programmed to do,
which is to keep the fuel mix at ideal conditions.  That also explains
why the alternator output doesn't matter.


Please let me know if this sounds plausible to you.
