Marv, I just replaced my '88 Turbo S clutch with the alternative "Club
Sport" Clutch disk and Pressure Plate.  It works great.  It doesn't have
the smaller springs that break so often.  I also thought I was replacing
my clutch mainly for the throwout bearing, but found upon removal that I
had two broken small springs, and the clutch disk itself was worn down to
the rivets.   Be sure to have the new clutch parts dynamically (sp?)
balanced together for smoothness and longevity.  I got the parts from Don
at Eurospeed, ph. 800-352-9441.  Part numbers are:

951-116-011-07  Club Sport Disk  $299.99
951-116-023-01  Club Sport Pressure Plate  $279.99
951-116-082-01  Std. Throwout Bearing  $103.75

Don tells me that the prices are higher partly because they are not
available in a kit form.  Tell him you found out from the 'net.

I'll give you all a better report of my clutch do-it-yourself job when I
get back from the Hudson River Whitewater Derby this weekend.  I have some
small suggestions for improvement of the FAQ on the clutch job.  Call me
at home on Mon. night or after for recommendations for tools needed.  I
bought many of the ones suggested and didn't even use half of them.

Good luck, and don't hesitate to email me for questions on the clutch job.
