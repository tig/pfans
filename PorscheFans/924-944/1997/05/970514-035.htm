please see: (this won't make sense without this image)

I'm a better technical illustrator than mechanic, but this will change...

In the illustration, I left the block housing and the cover off, so use a
little imagination on where those holes are. The comb filter has roughly
the correct orientation.

+ + +

I have an updated oil cooler seal kit and a one-piece oil-pressure relief
valve on an 1987 944 NA. The oil cooler kit has 10 seals. These are not
like the ones I took off, and the Haynes and the 1984 version of the
factory manual don't show as many parts.

I need some help figuring out where all these parts go. I was at the dealer
today and the fiche was not as helpful as I had hoped.

Yes, I have the "new" green rubber rings. I bought these seals from the
dealer as one complete kit.

+ + +

1. do I use any kind of thread seal/locktite or RTV sealant on this thing?

2. this one's ok

3. this one's ok

4. Is this is the new harder rubber seal that goes into the housing block?
I pulled a slimy soft washer out of this region.

5. This is a poly-something shim. I think it goes on the red/grey circle of
the illustration of the oil cooler element, but I'm not sure if it goes
inside or outside- it's pictured near the outside here- the inside would be
on the side as number 2

6. these are thin aluminum shims... I have no idea where these go, I did
not take any off...

7. these are thin aluminum shims... I have no idea where these go, I did
not take any off...

8. these are thin aluminum shims... I have no idea where these go, I did
not take any off...

9. Is a small green ring, looks like a perfect fit for the oil pressure
relief valve, but it looks a little thin...

10. a small aluminum washer/shim... it's too small for under the oil
filter, I'm not sure where it would go

+ + +

Also, I have the oil pressure relief valve plunger or whatever that thing
is, but I can't see the obvious advantage in using it. The manual says to
use it when preassembling the oil cooler, then bolt the cooler on and swap
the pluger for the actual oil-pressure relief valve. What am I missing in
this picture?

thanks... we're putting it back together now...
