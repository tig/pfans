i am sorry if this gets posted twice the email at this university is not that 
great.

i cant seem to keep the RMS anywhere near 900 where they are supposed to be.  it 
keeps wanting to drop to 600 or below (p.s. when you hit 200 it dies).  this 
morning it wouldnt go below 1100.  i did some work this weekend on the belts and 
may have gotten them too tight but i am almost sure that this is not the 
problem.  I also did some work on the front spoiler but this should make little 
or no difference.  the car has less than 500 miles since mid-december so my 
guess is that the gas has been in the tank so long that the filter might be 
clogged.  this is becuase it drove fine for about 30 mins. before the whole idle 
thing.  i bought some chevron techron additive and figure on running that 
through this weekend and maybe replacing the fuel filter if it is deemed 
neccesary.  i dont want to do too much that i dont have to because i already 
have an appointment for new timing belts,seals, rollers etc. at the dealership 
in San Antonio on the 16th.  

here are my guesses
1) clogged fuel filter
2) bad computer chip (the idle is electronically controlled right?)
3) i might have knocked off a vaccuum hose this weekend but i sure cant find it
4) the weather has been really hot and it might be related to the high ambient 
air temps.
5)?????????????

help please,

matt
