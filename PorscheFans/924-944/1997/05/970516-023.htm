This is great!

After re-reading my own message, I thought "what a whining SOB"  so 
I'm really glad you guys didn't slam me for that. - thanks!  The 
common opinions are:

1.	If I am buying a 911, buy a newer one C2 etc.
2.	Buy a 951 regular or 'S'
3.	Buy a 968

I need to clarify that both cars are only worth about $30K Canadian ( 
I live in Toronto, Canada).  That's about $22K U.S.  I am not 
independently wealthy, and therefore cannot afford a newer C2/C4 or 
turbo.  The 911 I'd consider buying would be an SC or Carrera 83 to 
88.  Also, I am looking for a car that can be a daily driver, but that 
I can take to the track for a little extra fun (strictly amateur). 
 One of the reasons that I want to get rid of the Maser is that it is 
NOT a daily driver ( or is very expensive if used daily).

My main concern with the 951 is the Turbos.  I own a turbo and am 
worried about "extra" maintenance.  The 911's are reputed to have 
"bullet proof" motors which sounds great to me.  The problem with 
those is I'm worried that I don't have the skill level to properly 
drive one of these well.

P.S. Farzaan: I compliment you on your name.  Are you my long lost 
Brother :-)??  Know any other Kassams - maybe we could start our own 
club!
