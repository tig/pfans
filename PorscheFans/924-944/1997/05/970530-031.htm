Unfortunately most of the tires you'll find in the sizes you need are of
the high-performance variety, so don't expect a 50k warranty.

That said, I've gotten good mileage out of BFG Comp T/A ZR...around 20k
miles, and I drive fairly aggressively. Ultimately your mileage depends on
what type of driving you do (city vs. highway) and how aggressive you are.

Who made your replica wheels? Any impressions on the quality, relative
weight, etc? How much did you pay? I'm considering a set of these for my
951S and am reluctant to go from a very light, very strong forged wheel to
a heavy aftermarket model. Does anyone know if the factory 993 wheels are
forged, and if so, how much they weigh -- especially in comparison to the
stock 951S wheels?

Thanks,
