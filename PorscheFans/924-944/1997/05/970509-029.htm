You could always take off the door panel and take a look at the mechanism
inside the door. Perhaps oil it up or adjust it somewhat. If it turns out to
be a problem with the door handle itself, get it off and get a replacement
one at the nearest VW dealer. It's the same as on most VW cars. I just had
mine off to give it a nice coat of new black paint. I'm kinda obsessed with
fading paint.. I even resprayed my windshield wiper arms. :)

One thing though - Haynes says that it is possible to get the handle off
without disassembling the whole door. Bull! It's hard enough to pry off the
locking and opening mechanisms even with the door panel off and staring
everything in the face. And reconnecting them.. Don't mention it. I can't
see any way to get them back on without going into the door to do it, and
even then it is a pain in the ass. It's not hard, just a lot of fiddling.

Or - maybe it would be enough just loosening the screw on the side of the
door which holds the handle in place, getting the handle out from the door
without disconnecting the mechanism, and just lubricating everything in
there? Be careful not to get any oil on your paint though..
