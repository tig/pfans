Hi John.

actually, it sounds more like a combination of metal vibrating, a fast toilet
flush, and water running through pipes (I know that sounds funny/silly but
it's hard to describe it any other way)

and yes, it is only audible at light throttle

i do also hear a soft whistle or whinning type noise and my mechanic told me
i am hearing the bellows (don't have a clue as to what he's talking about)
that my belts are running on

i am still running totally stock in my car and have not installed any chip
upgrades as of yet

if your car has always done this, has anything been done on it to remove the
noise?
