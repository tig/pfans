Some of you guys must have had the spoiler off your 944 or mounted one to
your 924. Could anyone please tell me where the screws are supposed to go? I
checked a 924 with a factory spoiler, and the screws went through the part
of the frame where the glass is! Is drilling holes in the glass safe, or
necessary? The spoilered 924/944 hatch doesn't differ from the unspoilered
924 hatch in any significant way, does it? It doesn't have portions of the
glass cut away to make room for the spoiler screws?

Also, are the overside parts of the hatch frame supposed to be taken off
when putting a spoiler there? The 924 I saw didn't seem to have these, at
least it didn't look like it from underneath. Do these come off easily?

I have talked to every shop in town, and nobody wants to even touch it
because they say it's too difficult.. I don't believe them, since so many
have told me it is no problem. But I can't see how it can be done without
drilling the glass.
