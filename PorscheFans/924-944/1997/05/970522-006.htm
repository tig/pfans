I've used Redline MTL in two non-Porsches and was fairly pleased with it.
I've been told that some cars don't like it, though (even those for which
it's within specifications) so your mileage may vary. I've also used AMSoil
in the past with good results.

I'm planning on changing the gear oil in my '89 951 in the next couple of
weeks, so I'd like to hear from others who've tried the various synthetics.
Specifically, I'm interested in your experiences with Redline, Swepco,
AMSoil, and the others in 951 transaxles...especially in cars with limited
slip.

BTW, I hear Imparts has Redline on sale for $8/quart.
