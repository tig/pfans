<< Originally the insurance company wanted to give me a whopping 7k for my
 car.  It had 3.5k worth of new wheels and tires, not to mention that it
 was a PERFECTLY maintained car and the high book value was 10k.  Of
 course the insurance company is a business and they want to save some
 money.  Anyway, I rejected their first 3 offers and suggested my own
 figure.  Each time they came back with a little more money, finally
 saying 8.7k is as high as they would go.  Then, I went to the dealership
 from whence the car came and had the sales manager go to bat for me. >>

Most people don't believe they have this kind of power over the insurance
companies but they do.  A few years ago my daughter was in an accident and
the insurance company wanted to total the car.  They then proceeded to give
us a "low ball" figure.  I went to a couple of local dealers and got "real"
estimates of what the car was worth and the insurance company finally paid
off in full.  Sometimes you just have to stand up to the big guys and make
them pay attention!
