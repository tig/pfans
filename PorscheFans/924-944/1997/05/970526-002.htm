Hi all,

I haven't written in lately because my car has been so well behaved.  
I've been doing around 400 to 600 miles per weekend.  Hitting bed & 
breakfasts with my girlfriend and so on.  Write me if you'd like ideas 
for 2 and 3 day trips in the MD, VA, Washington area.

Anyway, I recently had my driver's side repaired and resprayed.  The PO 
got swiped by a pickup in a parking lot.  Galvanization failed on the 
door.  Had all dings removed.  Door had to be blasted to metal to take 
care of corrosion.  Then a respray with Sikkens paint.  I dare say match 
is perfect.  Body man was careful to rub the rest of the car out with 
"Liquid Glass"; so the difference between the painted and unpainted 
areas is not so stark.  To further freshen the overall look, he stripped 
and resprayed my mirrors and applied new stone guards all around (doing 
mirrors only added $125 to the other work - extremely well worth it in 
retrospect).

If anyone has questions or concerns about doing a partial like this, 
please feel free to contact me.  I'd be delighted to share the body 
man's information.
