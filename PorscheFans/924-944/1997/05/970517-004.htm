Just remember that you can never, repeat, never drain all of the oil out of
the engine, unless it is undergoing a complete teardown.  As long as the
car is on level ground when you refill the crankcase, start off with 4
quarts after a filter change, start up the engine & let it warm up a
little, then re-check the level on the dipstick, and adjust until it is
between the two marks on the dipstick.  And don't forget to check it
regularly between oil changes (like, whenever you gas up, or after it has
been sitting for a time).  Pretty soon, you'll have a good idea as to just
how much it will take each time.  Thank goodness they came out with the
re-closeable plastic containers in place of the old round cans you had to
use a churchkey to open.

Hope this helps
