Gary,

I went through this with BFG two years ago.  I had cracks both radial =
and circumferential on three of my 944's four tires.  =
My-friend-the-mechanic noticed them when I had my car on the lift.  I =
got him back when I found the same on his 911's tires (nyah, nyah).

The greatest risk here is that the cracks allow water to invade the =
steel belts, corrode them, and lead to belt failure.

Like you, I spoke with an engineer at BFG.  I forget their exact answer, =
but it was less than helpful.  They recommended the following three =
things:

1. ignore pyrometer, run higher pressure.
2. less weight on each of the tires
3. drive more slowly at the track

Couldn't do much about #2, was damned if I'd do #1 or #3.  I switched to =
Yoko's for last year, am back to BFG's at the moment after the new =
Yoko's got trashed by GRM.  I am holding our hope for the Kumho and Toyo =
track tires, just waiting for a little more input from people trying =
them out.

Kevin
