Mark, 

Sue for what, they can not sue for your opinion regarding the service
provided. Remember that a bad experience takes at least  20 good
experiences to change the opinion of the client. If you go to a
Restaurant and you have a crappy service, you say that to your buddies
right?? Hey we're pals on the list with the same love P-Cars, and we
care about the service someone do in our babies!!!

You can always recommend and the mouth to ear is the best way to do it [
in this case, fingers-kybd-screnn :))]

Adrien

Ps: found a new spot for alignements in Lawrenceville. Omni tire in
HWY20 
towards de city. good service and very fast,. Aligned my front end for
32.00 :))
