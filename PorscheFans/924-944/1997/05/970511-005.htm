P-nuts:

Jlplee@GTE.net wrote on 5/8 that Farzaan is full of s--t because of his
opinion that 9 and 10 inch wheels on a 951 would contribute to excess
"hunting" or "tramlining."  I know that Farzaan is right (as I'm sure most
everyone else does as well), since I just went from my 205/55/16 snows to
205/55/16 D40s several weeks ago on my 968.  The size isn't even different,
but the actual difference in width is substantial, probably 1-2 cm.  The
snows didn't hunt at all, but the D40s hunt noticeably on crowned pavement.
 So small differences in width can make big differences in tramlining.

Besides, Farzaan is THE MAN.  He and Jim Richmond are the main reasons I read
this digest every day (ok, all you other guys are pretty good, too).  I got
chills a few months ago when he wrote about the 951 caravan to some racetrack
to compare chips, tires, and to use these cars the way they were meant to be
used.  I was snowbound at the time, but my first autocross is coming up...
