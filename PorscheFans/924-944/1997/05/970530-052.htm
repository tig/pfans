>>>>>>I have some clear, slightly slippery fluid leaking from the somewhere 
under the engine compartment.  I cannot locate the source.  It does 
not look like oil or power steering fluid.  About a two months ago I 
saw a large puddle of the fluid and looked for the source, could not 
find it.  Up until last week this "puddle" did not reoccur, now it has 
happened again.  Any clues?<<<<<<<

I had the same problem w/ my '86 turbo.  kind of a sporadic coolant puddle.
 It's probalby coming from the nipple on your water pump (I'm not 100% sure
what the nipple on the water pump is, but that's what my mechanic told me had
a very slight drip) I figured, as long as it's just barely dripping, screw
it.  About 6 or 8 months later, my temp needle started jumping around more
than usual.  It would get 3/4 way from the last line to the red, then jus
drop to normal.  Then one evening when I got home, I left it idling infront
of the garage, went inside for two minutes, and when I came out it was just
in the red and the idiot light was on.  

I tried to change the thermostate, but gave up after trying to get the damn
ring clip out for about 3 hours.  I put the hose back on and drove it to my
mechanic.  I almost had a pump put on to (because of the sporatic drip) but
decide to go w/ just the thermostat and a new fan switch.  My baby runs on
the first line or about a mm above ALWAYs now, and no longer drips.  I do,
however, seem to be loosing coolant somewhere.  When it had the drip, it was
about 2 or 3 cups a week.  Now it's only about a 1/2 to 1 cup every week or
two.  I'm hoping it's not the headgasket.

However, since you're doing all your belts, you might want to go ahead and do
the water pump if it's never been changed. (don't forget the thermostat,
install is MUCH easier w/ the pump out!).

Good luck,
