Not only was she a genuinely nice and enthusiastic person, but an extremely
talented one working with clay.  She was forever hand-making trophies for
RMR/AMR PCA events.  I am lucky enough to possess a small dish from an
Aspen event and a tall mug from a Pueblo event, both in 1985, when I was
just in my second year of PCA.  She and Pat did a pre-purchase inspection
on a '74 911 Carrera I purchased in Denver in '86.   Unfortunately, I don't
have the Carrera anymore, but I will cherish the trophies and her albeit
brief friendship for a long, long time.
