Farzaan, and all:

There is no way anyone with a 944 (any 944) will know for certain that
their engine is not living on the brink of destruction without a proper
mechanical inspection - especially after 60 or 100 K miles. Statistics
are telling us a very good story, but individual engines can and will be
different at times.

A 'new' engine may have a spread of 5 % on power, just because they are
'individuals'. A worn engine, but still serviceable and without any
problems 
can have 10% power drop. Small, but generally unnoticeable 'errors',
like ever so slightly bad valves can make you loose 15-20 hp, as can
worn piston rings.

I am just proposing that if you are going to rise the output of an
engine with 25 %,
it may be a good idea to *know* that it is in top condition. Most people
doesn't have access to a dyno, wich BTW is a very good way of checking
this.                      

My use of the term blueprinting may be misleading, but I do think that
renewing worn parts and checking all tolerances is beneficial, when
asking more of *any* engine. 

I do not propose that this can be done much better than the factory
already did, so blueprinting may have been a bad term to use, as it
implies 'better than factory' standard.                              

Chipping pro's and con's applies to all engines, not only
turbocharged.
