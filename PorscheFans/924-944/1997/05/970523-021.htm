Vaughan -

If the compressor has not been turned on a lot during this time of no
freon, you may be okay on that part.  If it has been used it's hard to
say.  Definitely need to replace the receiver-drier if it even has one. 
If not, and this should be done anyway even with a r-d is to evacuate the
system for a couple of hours with a vacuum pump.  This evacuating is
interupted with a splash of refrigerant after about 45 minutes.  This
splash is suppose to be just enough to disturb and water that has clung to
the sides of any pipes or atomize it so it can be evacuated.  What has
happened is that since the system has been filled with air, there is
moisture in there (air contains moisture) and that could cause problems
down the road (no pun intended). 

Fixing the tube may be another problem.  Maybe you can find someone that 
can re-weld/braze it?  Or find out who did the conversion kits and see 
if they are still around for parts.  Still, you could try George or other 
used parts places.
