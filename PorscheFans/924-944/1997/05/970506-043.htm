How would you describe this "bludder" sound? Ever since I bought my '89 951, it 
has always made a slight "pinging" exhaust noise that sounds somewhat like a 
leak. I haven't found any leaks, though, and the mechanic who performed my 
pre-purchase inspection didn't notice anything either.

The noise is loudest when the car and exhaust are cold, but continues to some 
degree when fully warm. Is this normal? What is the "normal" exhaust sound for 
this car?

My car is an 1989 model (Turbo S); I understand its exhaust is somewhat 
different that the earlier 951 models. If this is true, what are the 
differences?

Thanks in advance,

-Jeff
