I have a Passport hard-wired in my car and use the suction cup mounting
just below the rear-view mirror, so that it kind of blends in.  I tapped
off of the interior light just above it for power (just make sure you pick
the correct wire, the one that is always hot, not the one controlled by the
light switch).  When I'm auto-xing or tracking, I tuck the cord into the
gap between the headliner and window trim.  All in all, a neat and compact
package.  This, or previous original version Escort, and my CB have taken
me on multiple cross-country trips (12 straight Porsche Parades) without a
ticket since 1985.
