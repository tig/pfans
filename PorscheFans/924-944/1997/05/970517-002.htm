<< The 911's are reputed to have 
 "bullet proof" motors which sounds great to me.  The problem with 
 those is I'm worried that I don't have the skill level to properly 
 drive one of these well. >>
Until you miss a shift and over rev them. In my 15 years of doing track
events I think that the most common catastrophic "oh s..t" is a 911 owner
that slams his car into a lower gear while trying for a higher one. Can you
say complete engine overhaul? Can you also say "big $$$." Oh sure I have seen
my share of spun rod bearings on 944's but an over reved 911 is more common
and more expensive. Know one guy that did it 3 times in one race season (an
SC). The last time he approximated the revs of a Formula 1 engine and could
salvage nothing. This isn't an indictment of 911's just a reference point to
keep in mind.
