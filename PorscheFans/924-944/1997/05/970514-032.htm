I have an '86 951 with 92,500 miles on it.  I have two problems:

1.  The clutch pedal does not want to come all the way up.  It will spring
back after a shift without a problem, but the last 1/4 to half inch of
travel will only happen with a tap from my foot, which makes it spring back
into place.  

2. The rubber boot that is visible on the master cylinder (??) from the
cabin seems to be saturated with fluid.  It is semi-visible when the clutch
is disengaged, but when it is engaged a virtual puddle forms on the
outside.  It hasn't reached the point where I have fluid on my carpet, but
it concerns me.

Are these two problems related?  I have been told by Motorwerks in
Barrington, IL that I am ready for a new clutch, but it still works fine
with this minor exception.  I can acquire parts for under 500 that are OEM,
but what is labor for something like a clutch replacement?  Also, what is
labor for motormounts?

Thanks in advance for the help.

Jeff
