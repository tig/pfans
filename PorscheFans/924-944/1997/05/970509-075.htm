Here is my .02 cents (really, $4,500) worth on the "to chip or not to chip"
question:  My experience with chipping a NA 944 was less than rewarding to
say the least.  I have one of the older models where the DME unit actually
had to be sent to Autothority to make the change (the old 'chip' stays in;
they add a new circuit board with the mod chip).  

The engine had 65K miles on it at the time of installation. Even though I
put in Amoco premium (93 octane), I noticed certain throttle/load
conditions during which a small amount of detonation could be heard.  I
suspect this was due to residual carbon in the combustion chambers/piston
tops or bad gas.  Now I knew that pre-ignition was not a good thing, but it
didn't happen often and so I thought no big deal.  As some of you may know,
the NA 944 does not have a knock sensor, as do the Turbos, that will retard
ignition timing if incipient detonation is 'heard'.  This is a critical
point that I feel makes chipping a 944T somewhat safer than the NA. 
Anyway, a few weeks later, I took the car to a Driver's Ed and during the
2nd run I began to notice a miss.  Hmm, that never happened before.  I also
noticed that the afore mentioned pre-ignition was very noticeable at one
particular turn exit.  Before you could say "blown head gasket", I was
looking at a huge cloud of white smoke in my mirror.  It was pretty
obvious, at that point what had happened.  It was a Triple-A  (as in: flat
bed) ride home.  The next few day's autopsy revealed not only a blown head
gasket, but a badly scored  no. 4 cylinder wall (from being steam cleaned;
this was where the gasket blew) and the top compression ring (on all 4
pistons) was broken into 6-8 pieces!  Oh yes, and a crankshaft that was
slightly (but expensively) bent.  Not a banner day.

Even with me doing the engine removal, disassembly and re-assembly, this
little blunder cost me $4,500 shekels (re-boring the block on these is very
expensive).  Again, the knock sensor in the Turbo should minimize this
scenario from occurring, but  it does illustrate what a blown head gasket
can lead to.  Something to think about......
