Dudes,

I just got a confirmation email that my Hoosiers are on there way.  With
that email, R&S Racing also sent me a very good instruction manual on
how to use the Hoosiers.  They are basically saying the same stuff we
determined by testing and talking to the Hoosier rep, but it's compiled
very nicely for those contemplating using the Hoosiers.  The document
is very honest giving expected life, etc.  If you are interested in
reading it, I can email it to you directly (about 4 pages long).

Tracy,
Wait until you get that wheel/tire combo on the car.  You will feel the
weight difference immediately in acceration and braking especially.  They
say that 10lbs taken off at wheel speed is like taking 3x10lbs off of the
car's body in terms of acceleration so taking 40lbs off at wheel speed
is like taking 40x3 = 120lbs taken off the car's body in terms of acceleration.
If you've ever run with a low tank of gas, you'll know that 120lbs can make
quite a difference to response and all-out acceleration.
