Gentlemen,

I would like to thank you for your assistance in getting my wife's car 
started. I checked out all the things that were suggested and narrowed it 
down by a process of elimination. The cylinders were wet with gas and the 
plugs were a mess. New plugs and a good drying of the cylinders with 
compressed air got the car started once the weather warmed up.
 I took the car to a local dealership and asked them to troubleshoot it for 
me. They checked the belts, ignition system, fuel injection system, ring 
gear, starter motor and all the sensors. The only thing they could find was 
that the starter motor was drawing "well over 600 amps". Their theory was 
that in cold weather the amp draw from the starter was starving the plugs 
for enough current to create a spark, hence no starting. They replaced the 
starter motor and it starts on the first crank. It also seems to have 
corrected a starter kick-back problem that started when the weather turned 
cooler. I guess we'll have to wait until next winter to know if that was the 
only problem but at least my wife will have her car for the summer. 
 One of you pointed out that the car is complex but not rocket science. I 
now believe that with the marvels of the InterNet and netusers like 
yourselves anything is possible. Thanks again.

P.S.   I took the car for a good long drive today and I have to admit that I 
can see how you could really get hooked on these vehicles!
