Hello all ...

(some of you may have seen my cry for help on purchasing a '86 911 ...
I was back to the dealer today, and saw a '91 944 s2 cab which I am
now considering)

I'm looking to purchase a '91 944 s2 cab from a local Porsche dealer.  I
don't know much about the 944 s2, and was hoping someone could send me or
point me to some info/advice on this model Porsche.

I would like to know what this model's reliability is like, and what
issues I would look for or ask about before purchasing this vehicle.
Also, what problem areas does this vehicle have, and which repairs are the
most common? (like, is the clutch likely to burn out, suspension problems
etc.)

Vehicle looks very nice (black exterior, black cloth top, black leather
interior).  Vehicle has 55k miles, and seems to drive pretty well. Back
plastic window looks like it will need replacing in a year or so. They want
$26.5k, however I'm likely to offer something like $23k. To my surprise,
this dealer is offering a 1yr/12,000mi warranty on this car.

I'm also considering an '86 911, however I didn't want to start a religious
war by asking which one (911 or 944) was better. Anyone out there
own(ed)/driven both and have comments on which was preferred?  I'm leaning
toward purchasing the '91 944 s2 cab because it is decked out with more
luxury items (it's newer), is slightly less expensive, and has a decent
warranty.

Thanks all for your help.
