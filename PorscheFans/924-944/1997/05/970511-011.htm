I ran across a company called Drive Line Service of Atlanta, who I recently
used to rebuild a fairly complex (two sections, 2 U joints and a CV joint)
driveshaft from one of my other German cars. They did an excellent job and
in talking to one of the guys there I found out that they will rebuild
practically any driveshaft or CV-jointed axle.

I was intrigued and asked what they would charge to rebuild the axles on my
'88 951. The price was $95 each, plus shipping, which seems like a good
deal for someone wishing to avoid a messy job. Note the price includes new
joints and boots, grease, packing, etc.

Their number is 770-242-9366.

Usual disclaimers apply.
