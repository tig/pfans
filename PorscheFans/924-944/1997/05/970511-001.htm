 Hello gang:

This thread goes out to all the list members who take their time and effort
in order to answer peoples tech problems on this list. These people, who I
assume have many Porsche problems of their own to contend with, share their
experiences and knowledge unselfishly to help a fellow P-car fellas in need
of guidance. My hat tips to those guys out there, and specifically, Matt
Warner, who took his time and walked me through an problem he had battled
with in the past. Thanks to his help my baby is back in where it belongs!


Thanks

Alec Miller
