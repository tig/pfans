It's a well known fact, that law enforcement is tolerated much better
when actual enforcement actions are taken against sombody else but *me*.

We all drive differently, and to make things work allright in the
traffic, we have rules to follow. The only really necessary rule, to use
prudence when driving, is only working for responsible individuals, with
a lot of experience. 

Now, I hear a choir shouting 'Who isn't'... 

Well, witnessed by the accident statistics from all over the world, not
everybody is that experienced and prudential.

Traffic cops have therefore got the assignment to remind us of the
'rules of the road' and we shouldn't object to that to much.

Last time (many years ago) I was caught in a speed trap and got a
ticket, I wasn't too happy, but the policeman gave me his straightest
face and said: "How about to even out that ticket over all the miles you
have driven too fast?" I couldn't help smiling, and so did he, but I
still had my ticket.   

I have personally seen policemen turn very blind as long as the speeding
is not too obvious. Speeding combined with bad driving habits is some
quite different - thats a sure way of attracting the police's less blind
eye...    

Keep a sharp lookout, drive safely (but not necessarily slow)
