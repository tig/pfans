While I love the look of the 944, lets admit that it isn't perfect.

The lower rear of the car leaves a lot to be desired. The area under the
bumper lookes like Porsche forgot to finish it. Having the spare tire well
show is IMHO, inexcusable. The turbo looks a little better, due to the
lower apron wing, but it too is not perfect. Also, the area between the
tailights looks poor. The aftermarket kits to fill that in really cleans
that area up. It's kind of silly when you have to buy a $100 plastic cover
to complete the look of your expensive (when new) sports car. The problem
with those kits is that have to relocate the license plate to the bumper,
which spoils the smooth line of the bumber.

Other than that, I love the exterior look and lines of the car.

Barry,
I diagree totally! I love the looks of my 944 just the way they are, from
any angle. I think that the spartan looks of the rear end are remenicent of
those older sport cars of the 50's and 60's. As for those aftermarket kits
that fill in that space between the taillights, they remind me of those
decals motorheads put on their windshields with the make or model of the
car printed on them. I always figured that they put them there in case they
forgot what kind of car they were driving.
As for the 944, I've never seen a car that combines so many different body
styles into one gorgeous package. The front end is sleek and exotic and
hugs the pavement like many late model cars, the rear end is rounded like
some of the old coupes(jags etc.) without looking like some of these
"bubble" cars being made lately. But the real unique beauty of the car, as
many of you have already mentioned, is definately those flared fenders.
Some nights I back it into my garage and I go back out open the garage door
and just stand back and look at it. I'm also glad to see that I'm not the
only one who spends half the time I'm driving watching the road and the
other half staring at the back fenders in my side view mirrors. I'm 41
years old and for  the first time in my life I can drive down the road
knowing that I'm never going to see another car I'd rather be driving.

I do agree with Rich Freitas though. He said:
You're right, the 944 may not be perfectly designed car....but, it's way
ahead of whatever is in second place!

But you must admit Rich, it's hard to be too humble when you're driving
"The best looking car in the world"
