Hi all!  I've had a few comments about working for a company that would
fire me just because I bought a Porsche...  Well, I did tell the owner
of the company the his ES300 was nice, but could not really be a sports
car because you had to buy an automatic with them and that a Porsche was
a better deal...  (:

When I started with  the company I had an 88 924S, sold it, drove the
Audi a few months then bought this gorgeous 951.  Still drive the Audi
in the rain.  I don't want to sell my car!  Isn't there a terribly
wealthy someone out there who would like a little fey blond (shaych) to
go to bars with and be a friend?  Rich fag-hags may apply too.  I will
let you ride in my car and be seen with me!
