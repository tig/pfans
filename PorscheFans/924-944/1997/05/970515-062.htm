No, I've never heard of a minimum RPM and there's a reason why it wouldn't
apply to the 944 if there were: the computer.  The engine computer takes a
number of variables into account, making it a knock-free engine (when tuned
properly), even when you're doing 25MPH in 5th gear.  The computer can vary
enough different items to keep the engine from knocking even in extreme
conditions.

As for engine temperature, a cold engine is usually best kept at the lower
end of the RPM band, but not for reasons having to do with knocking.  Metal
expands as it is heated, so a cold engine's tolerances are more open
compared to a running-temperature engine.  That is, running the engine up
through 6,000RPM first thing isn't the best idea because all the moving
parts are relatively loose compared to their normal operating condition.
This could potentially lead to an increase in wear if running hard while
cold is a regular routine.  Oil doesn't circulate nearly as well when cold
either.  And piston ring blow-by is also greater, meaning your oil gets
contaminated somewhat sooner.  But all of this is difficult to measure
since driving hard generates lots of heat and brings the engine to its
temperature pretty quickly.

Hope this helps.
