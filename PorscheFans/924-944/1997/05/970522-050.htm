Oops.  Yes, you're right-- see below.

Since I'm the one doing most of the barking on this particular subject, I'd
certainly like to benefit from your greater experience with this topic.
I'm certain that my particular experience was a sticky oil-pressure valve.
Why do I think so?  I found out when the side of the oil filter exploded
from the pressure and spit oil all over the exhaust manifold (making for a
terrific smoke show).  So, from the beginning, my viewpoint will be
admittedly biased towards this problem.  The other problem which I observed
in my car was that the engine RPM was only *slightly* lower than normal--
almost indistinguishable but notable between hot and cold conditions.  Is
it possible that this additional drag, however slight, might be the "straw
that broke the camel's back", so to speak?  Or perhaps some of the
electronics aren't as sensitive as they used to be?

As for sticking open versus closed when cold, I think I have to agree with
you-- the valve opens under high pressure to bleed the oil back into the
oil pan through a side galley, not through the upper engine as I have
mistakenly stated.  Perhaps this places some emphasis on the fact that a
valve can stick in either position.

Incorrect fuel pressure will cause problems as well, but would not be the
cause of a no-spark situation, would it?

As for your challenge, I obviously don't enjoy the experience you do.  But
I will risk putting my foot in my mouth by venturing a response: aside from
enriching the mix, too much fuel pressure would put more strain on the fuel
pump.  Electric motors draw considerable current even when they're barely
moving.  Also, the DME (according to Charles Probst, SAE) is supposed to be
calibrated to shut off the fuel pump in 1-2 seconds if the engine doesn't
reach 225 RPM during starting.  Too much fuel can also act like a wet
blanket for spark plugs.  Fuel condensing in isolated pockets will likewise
cause trouble.  Are any of these the answers you had in mind?

Unfortunately, in my case I did all of the above and the problem persisted
until that valve (and the oil cooler seals) were replaced.

I look forward to being enlightened on this subject!  Thanks in advance.
