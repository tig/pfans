1)  Does anybody know where I can find articles comparing
the 968 and the M3 (I saw one that included a track test of
968 vs M3 vs Subaru Impreza WRX about 2 years ago but can't
remember the publication)?


Nathan,

The publications that have compared the 968 to the M3 are the
following:-

MOTOR - An Australian publication, issue July 1994
This article summarizes the BMW as " refined, generous accomodation and
real touring ability". The 968 Clubsport was described as " having
sharper reflexes, more open line of communication, even more driver
involvement and dynamic ability that's untouchable for the money"

Comparision of 3 litre M3 with Clubsport 

Wheels - Another Australian publication issue April 1993
Handling comparison with range of vehicles from Honda NSX , RX7, Nissan
GTR and BMW M5. 968 Clubsport was the winner. " The car is dedicated to
pure handling". " The Porsche is  purpose built for this sort of thing".

CAR - A UK publication isse December 1993
A comparison test against 968 Clubsport, RX-7 and Renault Alpine.
Porsche wins hands down as is quoted as " the Best car we've driven in
ages." 

CAR - A UK Publication iss eu June 1992 
A comparison test against the 968 and RX-7

Road & Track - March 1992
Road test on the 968 at introduction.

As a proud owner of a 968 Clubsport the car is impressive, not the most
comfortable, particularly with the fixed Recaro Buckets, and no rear
seats; but definately quick.
