Hello Porsche Fans,

I've got an A/C question:  I'm trying to locate the high pressure valve. 
According to the factory manuel,  the  high pressure valve appears to be
located near the driver headlight (next to the reservoir that has the small
view window).  However, when I look there, I can't find a "valve" but 
what looks like a sensor.  My question is - does the sensor come off
which, after it is off, exposes the valve and if so, is there a special tool
to disconnect the sensor OR am I totally off base.  It is not as obvious as
the low pressure valve!

I'd appreciate any inputs or advice.  Also, the list seems to be working
for me again (i.e., I'm getting regular digest mail), however, I would
appreciate if you could e-mail me directly in addition to the list,  just in
case....

Thanks
