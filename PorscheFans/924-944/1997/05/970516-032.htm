<<Hi P-fans, what's the deal with autothority? I have a '86 951, bought
the
stage II chips from an individual, called autothority about buying the
banjo
bolt kit and they said I would have to " register" as a customer first.
The
cost for this was quoted at$100 plus what the banjo bolt kit would
cost.  So
I guess the $100 "registration fee" is to prove to autothority that you
have
the stage II chips in your car . You must have to register first before
you
can buy anything from autothority. Colin F. '86 951 chipped but not
bolted>>

Sounds like Autothority doesn't like unauthorized people copying and
selling their chips. I can't say I blame them. Keep in mind that it
takes many thousands of dollars and lots of time to develop new chips,
while it takes someone 10 minutes with an EPROM programmer to make an
illegal copy.
