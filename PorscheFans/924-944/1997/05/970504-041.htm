kinda like a corvette. however, i am finding this kind of hard to believe
since there are clips that hole the body colored on in place, not to mention
it might look kind of stupid!  i would like to see one to make my own
decision but i am not sure if it was a big prank or if it was for real??

Matt,

        The glass top is in fact a real beast.  I think it is referred to as
a "Saratoga" sunroof.  I've only see one, and it had a mirrored surface so
that if there were any ugly clips, they were not visible from the outside.
