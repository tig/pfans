Mr. Istook:

It is very apparent that you are extremely angry with the contents of some
of my messages and I sincerely apologize for any offensive or disrespectful
comments I may have made.  I possess an irrepressible desire to understand
how and why things work, which is why I became an Engineer.  But being an
Engineer does not mean that I always get the right answers.

My understanding of this list is that we question each other's assumptions
with the purpose of obtaining greater understanding.  I deeply regret that
we have been unable to work together for I am sure that there is much I
could learn from your greater experience and wisdom.

Again, my apologies to you and to the members of the list for any
out-of-line commentaries on my part.

Matt Warner
