Kevin, they are just Audi turbo automatics.  The transmission itself is
very easy, but if there is a differential problem (R&P), then we usually
look for another unit.  I put a 944 transmission into my Audi station
wagon because it is stronger than the regular Audi unit.  

I have never attempted to repair a R&P problem because of the cost
effectiveness, but the transmission is simple.  The main problem I have
seen is sheared splines on the forward/rev. clutch drum (on the 944). 
Valve body pistons can stick because of contaminated fluid, but the
entire valve body can be removed externally and cleaned.

With your evident experience, you definitely can learn to repair them. 
The Audi factory manual is very thorough on the specs. and technical
info.  Usually, the hardcore parts are ok, but they need pistons, seals,
and pump rings.  You really don't need any special tools to repair the
transmissions, you would to repair the differentials.

A 944 automatic runs pretty good and shifts well--not a bad way to go if
shifting is not someone's thing.

Best wishes...Don Istook
