Thanks to everyone for their replies.  I had no idea Bendix made so many
different things, from brakes to guns!  Anyway, I got some very interesting
and conflicting descriptions of this Bendix thing.  By careful analysis of
all the data, I've determined that it is essentially a worm gear that allows
a starter's rotational motion to be transformed to linear motion in an
armature, which is then converted back to rotational motion by a pinion that
spins the flywheel once it has been moved close enough by the Bendix.  (Did
I get that right?)  Now I have some more questions:

1)  I got one reply (not from the anyone on the list so I'm not really
embarrassing him if he's wrong) that said the SPRING that pushes back the
solenoid arm once the engine has started (or when you release the key from
its START position) is what is called a "Bendix."  Isn't that just a "return
spring?"

2)  I'm now confused about the function of the solenoid.  Doesn't the
induced E-field force the solenoid's rod out of the coil and push the pinion
against the flywheel itself?  Why do cars then have both solenoids and
Bendices?  (If the Bendix is in fact just a return spring, like question #1
addresses, then this would make more sense, because the solenoid and spring
would have to work in conjunction to extend and then retract the armature.)

I hope some of you guys can help clear up this matter.  I'm getting even
more confused after reading each new reply!
