Gasoline is tested by two methods wich give two octane ratings, RON and
MON. The RON value corresponds to a less demanding engine knock
resistance test, the MON test is similar, but more demanding. Those
methods, used singly, do not map perfectly to 'real world' requirements,
and it is common to use a composite rating made up from the two
methods.  A compund octane designation is then made by the simple
formula "RON+MON/2". 

The octane rating's only validity is for the fuels ability to withstand
pressure related spontaneous combustion, known as pinging, knocking or
detonation.

Now, for those who race, there are two interesting implications of fuel
quality and rating. The first is that the higher octane rating will
allow higher cylinder compression without ill effects. This rises the
output from the engine by rising the effiency of the engine, and better
use of the energy available in the fuel. If boost pressure goes up, the
virtual compression ratio of the engine goes up, not only by forcing
more air/fuel gas into the engine, but also by changing the compression
ratio for the air/fuel mixture related to athmospheric air pressure.
(See it as a two stage compressing, a little in the turbo compressor, a
lot in the engine...)           
The other is that the octane rating does not correspond to the energy
content in the gasoline. Different mixes of hydrocarbons give more or
less energy content to the fuel and will affect the power output of any
internal combustion engine, regardless of type with as much as 3-5 %.
While this may not be totaly independent of the resulting octane rating
values, there is a very large possibility of different burn rates and
effeciency differences of gasoline fuel. This may even change (a little)
from each fuel batch, even from the same fuel
supplier/refinery.             

In highly developed and regulated racing, fuel checks are made
regularly, so no one can cheat by using a more 'energetic' fuel. This
may therefore be a valid reason, too, for buying more expensive
racing-optimized gasoline when racing.

You dont give away even that small advantage to the competition :-).
