Classic Bosch CIS (continuous injection system) hot start problem caused
by fuel pressure leaking down (either an injector leaking or the fuel pump
check valve leaking) resulting in vapor lock on hot days.

Have your mechanic put a fuel pressure gauge on the fuel distributor and
verify this, then fix it...

(The main reason that I know this, not having ever owned a 924, is that I
have owned Audis since 1982 and have encountered this problem several times
on the same CIS system...)


Good Luck!
