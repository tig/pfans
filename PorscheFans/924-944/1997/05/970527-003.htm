Hi All,


This has NOT been my week!!  Anybody know where I can find details on
Vascar?  Got nailed yesterday.  78.6 mph in a 65 zone.  Damn.  Speedo showed
about 67mph the entire time.  I was being very careful as I had just seen
another NCHP cruiser in hiding a mile earlier.  He missed a black Alfa
Milano in front of me, going faster than I was.  I asked him about it and he
said "He was going too fast.  I missed him as he came through the first
mark."  Lucky me was about 6 car lengths behind.  He also mentioned that he
clocked me over 1/10th mile.  Seems _awfully_ short to me.  Any timing error
would be multipled by ten.  I wonder what the manufacturers recommend as far
as minimum timed distance and line of sightand distance of the observed area.

Incidently, the place that he was measuring from was an on-ramp that shares
a berm with its on-ramp.  There is no way to see oncoming traffic.  Maybe he
got a late start (read shorter time interval).

I'm getting my speedo checked this week.  I have no reason to believe that
it is inaccurate and the tires are the correct size.  Any other avenues I
should pursue?

HELP!
