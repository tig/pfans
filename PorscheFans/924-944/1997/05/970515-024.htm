Detonation is sometimes called preignition and is typically used to mean
knocking or premature combustion.  It occurs when the air/fuel mixture
inside the cylinder ignites before it is supposed to or else burns faster
than it's supposed to.  As the piston moves upwards, it compresses the
air/fuel mixture by 8, 9, or even 11 times (hence your compression ratio).
Since turbocharged engines are already compressing the air mixture before
it enters the cylinders, they cannot support high compression ratios--
their *effective* compression is similar to or better than that of normally
aspirated engines, but the compression ratio number you'll see on a chart
is usually less than that of a non-turbo engine.

Here then are two causes for knocking: spontaneous combustion and quick
burn.  The first: As the air/fuel mix compresses, it gets hot-- really hot.
And the more you compress it, the hotter it gets.  If it gets hot enough,
it will spontaneously combust (that is, without the need of a spark-- this
is how diesel engines work, only it's called compression ignition).  The
tricky balancing act with spontaneous combustion is having just the right
amount of fuel in the mixture to help absorb the heat (by vaporizing the
fuel and heating the mix) without putting in too little or too much.  Too
little can result in knocking.  Too much is wasteful, pollutes, and is less
efficient (meaning less power).  This cause for knocking doesn't usually
affect people here on the list (at least not those with non-turbo engines)
since the compression ratio isn't easily changed (you'd have to mill the
head, change pistons, etc).  The design compression ratio is usually based
on the type of fuel being used.  Alcohol-burning engines see something like
14:1 ratios; diesels can see 22:1; some modern street Ferraris see 11.4:1;
Non-turbo 944s see 9.5:1 to 10.5:1 (depending on year)

As for burning too quickly, this is where octane ratings come into play.
At higher engine RPMs, the ignition control is set to actually fire the
spark plug *before* the cylinder reaches top dead center (TDC).  The reason
is that it takes time for the combustion process to occur.  If you wait
until the piston is at TDC at 4,000 RPM, the burning mixture will be
already on its way out the exhaust port before it's through burning (loss
of power).  But if the fuel burns too quickly and the ignition system is
firing the plugs for higher octane fuel, then it reaches its too high a
pressure (the exploding fuel is expanding) before the piston gets to TDC.
That rattling noise you hear is all your internal engine parts literally
shaking-- that high-velocity piston is hitting an expanding wall of hot
gas.  Think of it as driving your car into a brick wall.  That's why
knocking can destroy an engine.  Fortunately, this more common cause for
knocking has several cures: use higher octane fuel; retard the ignition
timing; inject more fuel (richen the mix).  Most modern autos use some
combination of these to prevent knocking, which can actually be happening
before you audibly hear it.  The key is that those vehicles have knock
sensors.

What's this mean for us Porsche owners?  911 engines only recently got
knock sensors.  Non-turbo 944 models apparently didn't get knock sensors
until '87 or so (sorry, can't speak for the Turbos).

This is probably more of an explanation than you wanted, so I apologize if
it's too much.  As a disclaimer, there's lots of other theory involved in
combustion which I haven't even tried to address here, so this is by no
means a complete explanation.  If you need other info, just write.
