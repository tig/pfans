You thought you fixed the problem, You thought it was safe.......

It's BACK! The Intermitently Dying '84 944!!! ARGGHHHH!!!!


Don't know if anyone remembers this, but back in November I posted a
question titled "'84 944 cutting out while driving" related to the
seemingly common "drop dead" syndrome some 944s are experiencing.

Here is my story: <fade>

In the fall of '96, my wonderful '84 944 starting having the most annoying
problem. For no explicable reason and in no apparent pattern, the car would
die in a few seconds and not restart for several minutes. Bewildered and
confused, I pleaded for help on this newsgroup. I received many helpful
replies, which luckily I recorded. The suggestions were:

Faulty DME (fuel pump) relay
Chassis to engine ground loose
Loose wire behind fuse box
Engine mang relay
On-board computer
Wire connection to DME
Loose relay connectors
Screwed DME (please God please no)

Anyways, because of my small automobile repairing ability and even smaller
cash supply, I decided to try the DME relay. Right after replacing it, I
took it for a test drive. After about 20 minutes of driving, a Chevrolet
Cavalier cut me off and smashed the entire right-front. The car had to be
towed, and after it was repaired, I decided to put it away in storage for
the winter.

After missing the car terrible for 3 months, I brought it out of
hibernation at the beginning of April. It drove fine for over a month, but
about two weeks ago, the problem came back with a vengance. It's doing it
again, and it likes to pick really bad times for it: uphill on a bridge, in
a majour intersection, etc. I think I've pissed off more than a few motorists.

The problem seems to have no pattern whatsoever. Sometimes it happens twice
in a 20km trip. Sometimes it doesn't happen for days. Once it wouldn't
start for over half a hour. Several times it has only cut out for a
fraction of a second. Sometimes it does a sputter-sputter-die and sometimes
it appears to die instantly, with the revs dropping like a rock in water. I
figure its probably the fuel system not putting out, but when I crank the
engine, I usually smell gas after a few minutes. In desperation, I removed
the fuel filter and rinsed it out (didn't have time to get another one).

My father is a auto mechanic and he is returning from Poland in a week, and
I was hoping he would help me fix the problem, but I wanted to be able to
provide him with some places to start, so I am once again appealing to the
collective wisdom of 924-944@PorscheFans.com. If anyone can share their
experiences, suggest a solution, or even eliminate some of the above
possibilities, it would be greatly appreciated. If I ever beat this problem
I promise to submit all I've learned to the 944 FAQ.

Oh yeah, if you see a grey 944 on the side of the road with its Hazards on
in Vancouver, Canada, stop and give me a jump start. My battery's probably
dead from trying to start it.

later,
dominik.
