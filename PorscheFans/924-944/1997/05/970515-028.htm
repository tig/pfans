HELP!
Has anyone ever had any problems w/ the wiring harness going to the DME
control unit?  This started a number of months ago.  Every few weeks, my car
('86 951) would just die.  All electrical stuff (guages, lights, etc) still
functions, and It's getting fuel to (It's pretty neat when it dies in a
drivethru line, your trying to start it, and you keep backfiring in the face
of the car behind you!  This is also good lighting effects when your going
down the interstate at night.)  I would turn it off, and it would start up
and be fine for a couple of weeks.  It slowly started to get worse (i.e more
frequent)  I isolated the problem to be somewhere in the mess of wiring under
the passenger side floorboard.  It got to the point where it happened weekly.
 When I would be driving and it happened, I'ld reach down and yank on the
frame that the boxes are mounted to (at this point I had the frame unbolted
from the car body, so it was quicker to get to the stuff).  Just the other
day I was going to lunch, and it wouldn't start.  I had it towed to my
mechanic, and it started right up!  He played w/ it for awhile, and took it
home trying to recreate the problem.  Nothing definate.  I picked it up and
had no problems until last night.  I pulled the computer appart to check for
obvious bad solder joints, etc (the third time).  When I put it back in it
wouldn't start.  I tried starting it about 30 times (my starter is taking
serious abuse from this whole mess!) and it started twice.  Both times I
played w/ the connector and it died.

I've bypassed the security system and thats not it.  The plastic harness (the
piece where the wire bundel goes into that plugs onto the box)  is appart
except for the piece with the femal connectors in it that the wires go
directly into.

Next plan of action:  crimp the female connectors again (4th time) to make
SURE it's not a case of a loose female.  Use an emory board on the male
connectors to make sure it's not something inhibiting good contact.

After that, rebuild the wiring harness.

Comments or recommendations?  I've got DE saturday and would hate to miss it!

Thanks in advance,
