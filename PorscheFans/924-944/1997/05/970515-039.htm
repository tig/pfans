I was in the same boat as you at one time.  I wanted a 930 Turbo and only
a twist of fate made me buy this car.  My next car is going to be a 1991
911 C2 Turbo no doubt, but have you driven an 88 944 Turbo S or an 89 Turbo?
This is in no way a putdown on the NA or non-S Turbo guys, but the S models
or the 89 models are actually quite hard to drive.  There have been a number
of people on this list who have loaned out their cars and the new drivers not
used to the surge of power at 4000rpm end up whacking curbs, etc.  In 
autocrossing, it takes a bit of time to get used to the M030 suspension cars.
Ask Wes how many times he spun before he got the hang of it :)

The non-S model turbos come on power so much smoother and the suspension feels
quite a bit softer, although that doesn't stop Darren from spinning all the time :)

Take a boot in a 88TS or 89T and then let the list know of your impressions.
Character or not, the surge you get when the boost gauge is pinned at 2 bar is
enough adrenaline for even the most psycho person.

BTW - your parent's good taste shows in the last name they gave you!

Farzaan.
