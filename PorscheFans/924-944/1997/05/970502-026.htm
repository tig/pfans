What you say is pretty much a fact of automotive manufacturing history. 
One interesting point to me that you did not mention is that most of
Porsche's competition from Japan is now or soon to be history.  With the
exception of the RX7 they tended to be too heavy and bulky for my taste,
and appealed more to the "unwashed masses", even though they were for the
most part high quality stuff.  I doubt that the Japanese made any money on
there Porsche clones unless you factor in the intangibles such as an
increase in customer showroom traffic.  Mazda took a real bath on the last
RX7, but not to worry, they made it back and more on the Miata, presently,
the number one selling sports car in the world.

From what I can see, Porsche accurately read the market in the early 1990's
and moved decisively on their instincts, and they are exactly where they
want to be now.

I'm extremely happy that I chose to by the Blue Chip original ('89 944 S
Turbo) vs. the Up Start copy (RX7, 300ZX, GT3000VR, etc.) even though it
cost a little bit more.  As best I can remember, MSRP was $49,999.99 and I
paid $38,400.  I read that some buyers got them as cheap as $34,000.  But,
the dealer gave me 100% of the purchase price of my '88 944 on trade, so
what the heck.

There are a few tuners (Stillen is one) for the Japanese clones, but for
the most part, owners are hung-out-to-dry for hard core technical
expertise.  Unlike Porsche cars, where all it takes is $$$$$$$.  There is
no legacy and thus no infrastructure for the Japanese sports car owners to
benefit from.  Even the NSX, has no REAL sex appeal, ya it's a nice car but
I'd take a Esprit over it any day.  I remember one conversation with a
Z-car owner were he was bragging about taking 1st at LeMans.  I told him
that when they do it 20 years in a row then he would have something to
boast about.  They are trying to build that legacy now by re-manufacturing
the 240Z's and selling them in the $20,000 to $30,000 range.  I wonder what
the price would be if Porsche did that with the '73 911S?  Sign me up, I'll
take one.
