Hi Fellow Porsche Enthusiasts,
I wonder if anyone can help me with a problem?
I have a 1982 944 non turbo manual, ever since I have had it I have had a
problem with excessive exhaust smoke on overrun/decelaration after driving
it hard.
I thought it was just worn out (265,000kms) and had the motor overhauled
with new rings, bearings and a recond head but it is still the same.
My theory now is that the PCV valve is us, could anyone give their opinion?
Also I need to know is the PCV valve the outlet on the side of the oil
filler tube? and is the valve likely to need cleaning or is replacement the
usual remedy?
one more thing, if I need to remove the PCV valve can this be done without
removing the fuel injection inlet manifold?
Many thanks in anticipation,
Tony Sandler.
Perth Australia.
