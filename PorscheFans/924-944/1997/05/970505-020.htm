One of the reasons I like my mechanic is that he's the only person in
the shop. He's the bookeeper, receptionist, service advisor, and mechanic.
Whenever I'm there, he's always happy to let me crawl around the shop.
looking, (sometimes) touching, and asking questions. When something has
been done to my car, I know that he has done it, and no one else.

The problem is that I always spend twice as long there as I planned on.
Once we start talking about cars, I find it hard to leave!

If anyone is interested, I'm talking about Bill Mohr of Mohr Performance
Development. A small shop on Long Island, NY.
