Naweed,

        You seem pretty knowledgeable about the chipping issue.  Let me tell
you that I have one (Autothority Stage II) in my 951 and I would never go
back.  The difference in boost and torque delivery is dramatic.  And (cross
my fingers), I haven't experienced any problems to date relating to
premature engine wear or failure.  It's worth it for me, and it makes
driving around town that much more fun.  (By the way, the difference between
the 951 and 951 S involves much more than just a chip.)
