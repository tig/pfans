Basically, yes. Our autocrosses are at MacDill AFB and the site is huge. We
generally set the course up with a straight of varying lengths bisected by
the start/finish line. On average there is probably about 100 yards between
the start point and the timing lights and about another 100 yards to a
fairly low speed turn. You want to get moving quickly, but you don't have
to start like a drag race.
