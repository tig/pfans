That person is an idiot.  Just as with the 951, you can't just crank the boost
up and think the car will survive.  Just as I learned last week, making general
comments like that are not good.  There are several street driven, reliable
11 second monster Talons, just as there are several street driven, reliable
951's that are boosted with K27s and stroker motors.  There are also the
guys that don't do their research or are led astray by bad shops and just
crank the boost as your friend did.  Out here in B.C., that problem with
turbo cars is epidemic.  I've seen several 951s in the shop with scored cylinder
walls from when the piston rings shatter under detonation when the owner keeps
cranking the boost.  The T/E/L cars are actually quite good that way, you can
get a good reliable 250hp out of the 2.0L turbo motor without spending any
more money than a bleeder valve.  The stock ECU takes care of fuel and the
knock sensor deals with crap gas.  The T/E/L knock control system has much more
play than the Porsche system does which allows the idiot owner to push the
envelope a bit more on those cars.  The guy you mention above must have known
something about what he was doing since the factory boost control system on
the T/E/L cars restricts the fuel if the boost shoots past around 16-18psi.
Beyond that, you have to make some pretty tricky mods to the MAS sensor and/or
get an aftermarket fuel computer such as the HKS VPC or EFI unit from Doug
Wallace.  It seems odd that he managed 22psi and ran lean, the factory computer
would not allow that unless the guy made those "hack" MAS mods.

The T/E/L cars also do not use bolts, they just have plain vacuum lines with
nipples, so all you do is stick a fish tank aquarium valve inline, or you can
pull a ring out of the solenoid to allow it to vent a bit more (comparable to
drilling the cycling valve).

That is unusual.  A stock GS-T does 15.1 @ 92mph.  A stock 944NA would do
something like 16.0 @ 85mph.  I have found that when my bro had his 86
944NA that it was quite a bit quicker above 80mph than most of the high
performance japanese cars even if they had way more power.  Gearing I guess.

There are two versions available, a 1.8L Chrysler motor that belongs in a lawn
mower and a Chrylser 2.0L (Neon) engine that puts out 140hp.  Both are pretty
low on torque.  The old Mitsu 2.0L 135hp was a gem though with lots of umph
for a NA engine.

This I completely agree with.  The steering systems on those cars needed work.
When I raced mine, we increased the caster dramatically with camber/caster
plates.  I refused to race it with the stock geometry, it had no feel whatsoever.
