      My latest plaintive wail for tire recommendations for my 87 944S (with
standard 15" wheels) has brought forth a string of well-meaning, I'm sure,
but inconsistent particles of information.  I was trying to determine
whether I should (or even could) go to 225 50 15's instead of the factory
215 60 15's and whether mixing sizes front and back was important, possible,
or even necessary.  I have heard "yes", "no", and "maybe."  I have been
lectured on radius, diameter, and final drive ratio.   Dire predictions of
doom have been issued should I dare to defy the FACTORY RECOMMENDATIONS!!!!!
        What I really want to know is how your tires made you feel!  How did
they make you look?  Did they improve your love life; your job performance;
your relationship with your children?  Does the stereo sound better?  My
reason for wanting to go to the 225 50's was my impression that they will
look a lot better, and might not affect my daily driver's performance
adversely - is this true?  How about Firestone Firehawk SVX  or Toyo Proxes???
        Come on people - share your feelings!!!
