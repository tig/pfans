     THIS IS A REPOST.
     
     HANK WATTS: please pass this along to Nikki.
     
     
     
     
     
     Some things I've learned about 951 clutches:
     
     (i)     There seems to be only one current factory part for the clutch 
     disc. It is the same for all 951's.  It has four large               
     springs, and a secondary damper plate with six small ones.
     
     (ii)    Regarding above, the six small springs have a habit of 
     breaking long before the clutch is worn out, eventually causing the 
     clutch to fail to release.  I have a "like new" '89 951 with less than 
     30k miles, and these rascals just broke in December when the car had 
     26k miles!!!
     
     (iii)   I've put "cup car" clutch discs in both my cars.  I have the 
     Sachs and Porsche part numbers for those interested.  The dealer does 
     not sell these discs.  The key differences from the current factory 
     part are (a) only the four big springs are present, id est, there is 
     no extra damper plate with springs to break off; and (b) the friction 
     material and method of bonding seem different.  After having two 
     clutches prematurely break their springs (one in my '89 951 and one in 
     my '87 951) , I'll never use the current factory type.  The "cup car" 
     type can be had for the same price.
     
     In reality, it is not absolutley clear that this so-called "cup car" 
     disc is actually the unit that was used in all of the different racing 
     series which ran in the Eighties.  I've been told that the disc I use, 
     and which several vendors currently refer to as the "cup car disc," 
     may be more properly called a Sachs "heavy duty" or "sport" disc.  
     Nevertheless, the fact is that it does not have the extra small 
     springs which have a tendency to break.  So far, I have noticed no 
     "down side" to using these discs.
     
     (iv)    In my '87 951 (converted to Turbo S specs plus Milledge racing 
     chip) , I had a Euroselect clutch kit installed, which failed after 
     five months.  Upon inspection, the throw out bearing was the culprit.  
     When I compared it to the normal factory part, I noted a SIGNIFICANT 
     difference in quality.  I got reimbursed for the bearing and bought a 
     factory unit.  There may still be some Euroselect kits out there even 
     though the program was eliminated in favor of the current PPE program. 
     I'd STRONGLY recommend against using the clutch disc and throw out 
     bearing from one of these kits.  While we were doing the work, I had 
     the "cup car" disc put in. The Euroselect disc had the six springs, 
     and they already were showing signs of breaking after only 5k miles.
     
     Submitted for your benefit.
