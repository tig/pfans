Malcolm,

I confess only marginal knowledge of things automatic.  I believe there are 
a couple of manufacturer standards for automatic transmission fluids.  I 
think GM's is Dexron, Ford is Mercron.  If I'm not mistaken, the GM 
standard is pegged today at Dexron III or something like that.

I did my wife's car's transmission fluid recently and, travelling to the 
auto parts store, found a Mobil 1 synthetic brand available for about $5 a 
quart.  Since nothing is too good for Barbara (and in particular nothing I 
do...), I popped for a case.  As much as one can tell from driving the car 
hot and cold, seems to shift well and smoothly.

Mentioned this to a chemical engineer friend who claims to know something 
about tribology, and he said that the synthetic auto transmission oils are 
an extremely good thing for these cars' transmissions.

Regarding your valve seats, I would not worry.  Bruce Anderson dealt with 
this for 356 valve seats a few years back, and he quoted Rockwell hardness  
 tests for 356's going back many years for which unleaded fuel would be 
fine.

Kevin
