        The word disgusted is not my first choice, it starts with an F and
ends with UCK! Well the engine on my 931 is going back together this weekend
and before I recieved all of my parts on wednesday I decided to take my fuel
distributer apart and replace the gaskets. Inside there really isnt much, a
few o-rings and a diaphram type gasket. Other than a bunch of gunk
everything looks fine(not bad for 17 years of driving)so I called my local
euro-car shop to get the gaskets. Well after calling at least 6 places each
one of them told me that the diaphram gasket is a "bosche only" part and for
some reason they cant get them? I was told by all of them my only option is
to replace the whole fuel dist. for 700.00!!!! What the hell is going on
here, this stupid gasket couldnt cost more that 25.00 and why can the guys
who rebuild the damn things get the parts and I cant?!!! This is the only
thing on the car that I am aware of that I cant purchase and any help with
this problem would be greatly appreciated......Blake
