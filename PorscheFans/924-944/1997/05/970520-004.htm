I put 250 lb. springs on the front of my 951 & Koni adjustables all the way
around. The front was lowered slightly and I lowered the rear to the bottom
of the travel on the eccentric bolts. I did not have before and after times
on the car, but I can tell you that the car feels much better now, and I
don't feel as if I am constantly on the edge.

By the way, even though the car is lower, I don't scrape the nose as much
now as before, and I believe it is due the the stiffer springs not letting
the nose dip as much.
