> All,

I have to agree about the D40's I just replaced the A008P's on my 951
with D40's (17" wheels) and the car tends to pull on uneven surfaces
much more. Interestingly enough. When I had D40's on my old NA 944's in
15" and 16" the problems were never as pronounced.
The SP8000's I have on my 911 (17" wheels as well) do not have this
problem.

Just my .002 cents

&gt;The snows didn't hunt at all, but the D40s hunt noticeably on crowned =
pavement.
&gt; So small differences in width can make big differences in tramlining.

In this case it really isn't the width, but the tires (IMO).&nbsp; I've had =
the
D40s and that is just the way they are... they are extremely sensitive.
These were only 195/50-15s on my Civic Si hatchback.&nbsp; I replaced them =
with
SP8000s, which were much better, and now PZeros, which are better still
regarding tendency to follow road irregularities.
