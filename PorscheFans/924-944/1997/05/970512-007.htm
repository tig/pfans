As one who have been around the net for considerable time let me give
some comments on this very sympathetic opinion:

As for fighting it out in public vs private: Compare any boxing match,
with audience and referee, with a street fight. One is considered sport,
the other is a crime - although the same objective things happen. Net
works the same way, flames are no fun if not anyone watch, cheer and
bet...

Second, flame fights don't always have to be rude, boring or nasty.
Outwitting eachother may be great fun, and even funnier with a audience.
This calls for judgement, because there are always people not amused by
others ranting on and on.... 

Third, what shouldn't ever be allowed is personal attacks and profane
language - especially when that is combined. Difference of opinion,
expressed clearly and effectively may not be a flame - but none the less
create hurt feelings. Sometimes you say something stupid, then, try to
be a big boy and see any correction as a well earned lesson.       

Fourth, this is not an unmoderated newsgroup, but a mailing list. The
list owner may well choose to expell anyone writing posts of his
disliking, but in principle this has to be a very clear cut case. This
is why objections from list members may have a place after all, even on
moderated lists. 

To me this seems like a nice and wellbehaved group!
