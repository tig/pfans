if you want to talk boost and the easiest cars to raise boost pressure: eagle 
talon and mitsu eclipse. ask farzaan he'll tell you, all you do to turn up the 
boost is mess with the bolt that controls the pressure, have seen stock talons 
that were ungodly fast, even saw a friend of mine run close to 22lbs. of course 
his block now has a nice size hole in it and one piston can be seen through, in 
the middle that is!they certainly get fast but they have no where near the 
capability that the 951 does, i remeber giving the mitsu sales guy a ride in my 
944NA after test driving a 96 eclipse GS-T (read turbo) he was amazed at how 
fast it was, then i told him it was NA. wish i could bottle that face when he 
said you mean this one isnt turbo??? nope, good ole' fashioned water cooled 
4-cylinder, 2 valves per, pretty basic 150HP.  we then went and drove  a 
non-turbo eclipse, i though i would fall asleep from boredom, the hair steering 
coupled with a sponge for a clutch pedal made for a boring ride except the first 
time you go to change lanes and you sneeze on the wheel and it tries to take you 
off the road, not cool. well im done with my rambling now, sorry for the 
bandwidth but with all the talk of chips i thought i would add my bit of rice to 
the dinner table,
