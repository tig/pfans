Billy,

This is most likely due to a failed diaphragm in the heater valve.  It
is
located just behind the engine.  At part throttle, engine vacuum is high
(or low?) enough to keep the various vacuum-operated flappers in the A/C
system operating normally.  At higher throttle settings the vacuum is
reduced and the leaking heater valve will reduce the vacuum even further
so the flappers will change position.

You can check for this problem by disconnecting the vacuum supply to the
valve and sucking on it.  It will be easy to tell whether the diaphragm
is
faulty or not.

The valve is under $30 at the dealer and is easy to install.  Just be
sure
to remove about a gallon of coolant first to avoid soaking your clutch.

Have fun,
John
