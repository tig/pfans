Thanks, I've gotten Simple Green from somebody else... I remember it as
being pretty amazing stuff from a few years ago...

I may not even have that much left to clean, as most of the rest of the
cooling system is off the car, but the heater hose scoots right behind the
firewall, so I can't clean that very well, and the block may not have that
much to it except the galleys running down and around and back out...

Is it possible that by removing and replacing as much as I have, that I
don't really have that much goo left in the motor? I would prefer the clean
as much as you can, then run it a little and the drain/flush a final time,
but I got at least a quart of goo out already just with the
hoses/radiator/expansion tank, so I wonder how much is left in there now if
only the head/block is left?
