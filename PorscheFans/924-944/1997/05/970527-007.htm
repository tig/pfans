I just installed Performance Carbon brake pads on my 951, in preparation for
a Driver's Ed event this weekend.  The pads (and I assume most
high-performance pads) are not cut out for the brake pad sensors.

Since I only had two functioning anyway, and since I check my pads every
couple of weeks, I decided that, rather than wire the loose sensors up out of
the way (as I had been doing w/ the broken two), I'd just cut the wires.  I
started to unplug them at the connector, but I thought that'd fill up w/ road
crud, so I'd be better of keeping the male connector in the female receptacle
- hence, I cut the wires.

Now the "Brake Pad" light is on.  I thought I was careful not to allow the
wires to touch, thus completing the circuit.  What's the cure now?

Anyone "been there, done that"?

Need help quick!
