Porsche designed the 944 engine from the start to be turbocharged, at
least this was the statement they gave in a 1986 edition of "Panorama".
Based on this, the 2.5 I4 was designed to withstand the stresses
inherent in boosted power. Of course there are different levels of boost
that can be applied by turbocharging and how much boost they designed
the engine for wasn't stated. Many people have boosted the engine beyond
the normal boost supplied by Porsche with few side effects. The biggest
problem seems to come from blown head gaskets and burned valves/pistons
if the mixture runs too lean for some reason. However, the computer does
an excellent job of preventing overly lean mixtures, and most
aftermarket chip supplies program the chip to supply overly rich
mixtures at some speeds to lower the possibility of a too-lean mixture
burning a hole in something. 
	A lot has to do with how the car is driven, too. For around town
driving with an occasional all-out drag race or whatever, there will be
little additional stress on the engine. 

Regards,

('88 951, chipped for a year, no badness yet...)
