P-Fans,

This might seem like a lame question with an obvious answer, but I'll ask
for experienced input anyway.  I've got an S2 that seems to be used on the
track with increasing frequency, and proportionately less on the street. 
The suspension has upgraded sway bars and shocks.  I'm resisting adding
stiffer springs and lowering the car for a couple of reasons.  One is more
scraping of the front on driveways etc., and other is increased understeer
and the need to compensate with modifications to the rear suspension. Cost
is another factor, but hey, you only go around once.

My question is whether anyone's experienced real increases in track
performance after adding stiffer springs (250+ lbs) and lowering the car
about an inch.  I know that lowering the center of gravity is good, and you
get less roll.  But has anyone logged decreases in lap times before and
after these modifications?  If so, why? I'm a relative rookie on the track,
but I love hard driving. I'm within 3-4 seconds of my class time (1:05)
after my first outing on a track, and I figure I could find those seconds
with more experience -- w/out necessarily changing the suspension. 

Or not.

Opinions appreciated. Thanks.

-- Nick
