I think that this is probably the first case I've ever seen where the DME
is actually the problem.  In every other situation I've seen, it was either
a sensor for the DME, bad wiring, or something else.  Just out of
curiosity, was the car ever started with a system putting out more than,
say 15V?  It would seem unlikely that swapping chips caused the damage-- it
is possible to zap a computer while doing the *installation*, but once it's
in, if it runs, you're usually OK.  Another way to blow up computers is
with a bad voltage regulator on your alternator.  A high-voltage surge
would certainly be capable of blowing something as well.

But I'm still not entirely convinced that your computer is bad-- you stated
that it still ran when you push-started the car, and it certainly would
*not* run without the computer.  So don't throw the old one away just yet
(unless you have to exchange it for the one you just got, of course).

Perhaps worth considering is that, with the warmer weather, oil tends not
to be so thick as it is during the winter.  My own car would be nearly
impossible to start in the morning when I went through this, but worked
fine once warm and was less troublesome at midday.  In other words, you may
still have a drag but not notice it until the weather gets a little
nastier.  You may not be through with this just yet...

Another possibility is that certain model years may have slightly different
computers, and the replacement you purchased may be from a later year.
Porsche may have either eliminated this minimum crank speed thing or
reduced it.  But I'm not sure how to verify that, making all this is just
speculation.

Regardless, I'm happy that you're back on the road.  Please let us know how
it performs over the next few days-- I certainly hope that this does fix it
for you!
