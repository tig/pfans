To perform a leakdown test, you essentially pressurize each cylinder in
turn when it's at TDC and listen for leakage. If you have a leakdown
test kit, you also have the option of a guage to measure if any pressure
is lost, but this isn't absolutely required.

You'll need a source of compressed air, and an adapter from the air hose
to the spark plug hole. Remove all spark plugs and rotate the engine to
#1 TDC. Pressurize #1, and listen for leaks (air hissing out of the
cylinder) as follows:

If you hear air hissing from the oil filler cap (which opens to the
crankcase), you can suspect worn rings (air's leaking past the rings
into the crankcase).

If you hear air hissing from the tailpipe, you can suspect poor exhaust
valve seating (due to either grind or valve clearances possibly?) (I
don't know how well this'll work for turbos).

If you hear air hissing from the air intake, you can suspect poor intake
valve seating.

If you hear air hissing from anywhere else, you'll have a flat and need
to get out your patch kit ;)

Rotate the engine to TDC for the next cylinder in the firing order, and
perform the test again.

Another thing that comes to mind, based on your smoking problem, is what
about valve seals? They might need replacing... How many miles do you
have on the engine? Is it a Turbo? What color is the smoke, blue, black
or white?

Good Luck!
