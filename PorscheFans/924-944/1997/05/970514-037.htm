Daniel,
       You almost have it..

1) The factory workshop manual doesn't specify to use any sealant, and
you shouldn't need any.

2) 3) These go on the inlet and outlet to the heat exchanger, as you
know

4) Yes, the old one I pulled off was also dissolving, and was goo.. This
goes on the engine block side after you place the correct number of
shims (see 6,7,&8)

5) This one goes on the outside, on the housing side

6) 7) 8) These are shims. Once you have the oil cooler in the housing,
place a ruler on the housing, and place the shims on the red/gray area
in your picture until they are flush with the rules. This should be done
every time the unit is dissassembled.

9) I think this may go on your oil pressure relief valve, but I am not
sure. I didn't replace the seals on mine, but plan to in the near future
(they are on order). ~600 miles since re-build, no problems yet..

10) This goes on your oil pressure relief valve on the threaded section.
The oil pressure relief valve is screwed in after the housing is bolted
to the engine. I think this was ~60 ft/lbs??

I can fax you some pictures if you let me know what your fax # is, and t
year engine you have. Also, I think there is a special tool to align the
oil pressure relief hole when bolting the housing to the block, but I
didn't have it. My oil pressure relief vavle seemed to go in fine.

Good Luck!
          Ezra
