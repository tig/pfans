>>Some of you guys must have had the spoiler off your 944 or mounted one to

>>of the frame where the glass is! Is drilling holes in the glass safe, or
>>necessary? The spoilered 924/944 hatch doesn't differ from the unspoilered
>>924 hatch in any significant way, does it? It doesn't have portions of the
>>glass cut away to make room for the spoiler screws?
>>
>>Also, are the overside parts of the hatch frame supposed to be taken off
>>when putting a spoiler there? The 924 I saw didn't seem to have these, at
>>least it didn't look like it from underneath. Do these come off easily?

>>I have talked to every shop in town, and nobody wants to even touch it

>>have told me it is no problem. But I can't see how it can be done without
>>drilling the glass.

I believe there was a discussion about this a while back on the "Racing"
digest.  If Lance Flynn is listening in, he can probably answer the
question.  If not, his e-mail address is   <71137.1777@compuserve.com>.
Lance is a PCA Club Racer with a 951.
Good Luck
