<< I just thought of another little annoyance with my car that I've been
 living with. Maybe I won't have to if any of you guys can help me out.
 The trigger on the passenger side door handle is a bear and a half to
 squeeze. So much so that my girlfriend can't open it (I know, I should
 always get it for her anyway). Is there an adjustment on this thing,
 or is there anything easily serviceable to fix this? Any help you can
 give will be muchly appreciated! >>

Hey guys (and girls),

I have exactly the same problem . . . . . just substitute "wife" for
"girlfriend" above and I'm in the same boat.  It seems like there should be a
simple adjustment for this but I can't find it.  The door opens really easy
from the inside but you need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger to get it open from
the outside.
