When I had my "old" '83 944 and used a small hand-held CB plugged into the
lighter, sometimes when I keyed the mike, the windshield wipers would
activate.  I didn't have cruise control, so I can't comment on that issue.
I have used a more standard "mountable" CB in my '88 TurboS for extended
trips, and run a separate ground wire and have an external antenna
connected by standard coax, and have not experienced any problems with any
other systems on the car (and I do have and use cruise control).

Headed for Porsche Parade in San Antonio, and planning to use the CB and
cruise control (and hope I won't have to use the wipers)
