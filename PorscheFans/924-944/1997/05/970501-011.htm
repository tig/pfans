We've covered this quite a bit in the archives, but I guess they aren't
very easy to search.  But anyhow, Porsche has changed the thermostat to a higher
opening temperature to help emmissions.  I went through this exact thing you
did until my shop changed it back to an old 80C thermostats they had in stock.
All the new ones are 83C.  Someone recently went through this too and I think
he had the same results when he changed back to the low temp one.  When I called
Porsche to inquire, their response was, if it doesn't go into the red, it's
fine, and I believe them.  I've stopped worrying about the gauge moving around.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't all "new" pumps from Porsche
now rebuilds?  My new pump which came in a Porsche box with all new looking
parts was still a Porsche rebuild.  Apparently (this is from my shop), there
are rebuilds from the Porsche factory and then there are rebuilds from the
aftermarket.  They've never had any problems with the Porsche ones, but we
went through three aftermarket rebuilds.  As I said before, correct me if I'm
wrong.

>check out as for as temp kick on ect. Thermostat is supposedly the same as
>one that came out of car. 

They look the same, but the stamping says 83 instead of 80, so the mechanic
couldn't care less because it looks the same.  It took my shop a couple of
hours testing various things, then finally, they pulled out their infared
pyrometer and started taking temps from my car and then from another 951
in the shop and that's when they discovered the different thermostat temps.
