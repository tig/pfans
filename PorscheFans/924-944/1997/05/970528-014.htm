For those of you who may recall my previous post(s) regarding my chip/boost
upgrade, I found the problem!  For those who don't recall, a quick recap, as
this may apply to 944's as well as 951's.

My problem was that after installing Autothority 2.7 chipset, my max boost
jumped up from 10 psi to 12 psi at around 4,500 rpm, before bleeding down at
max rpm.   When I subsequently installed the restricted banjo bolt, I did not
see any additional boost.  I couldn't understand why, and neither could
Farzaan, Steve Timmins, Barry L. or anyone else from the list who tried
valiantly to diagnose the problem from afar. Thanks, guys.   You're not gonna
believe the solution. . .

You know how we've talked about the jump in boost at the very end of the
throttle travel?  Some experience a smooth progression of boost through the
throttle range - others seem stuck at .2 BAR until they floor it, and then
WHAM - full boost!  I was in the first category, smooth increase of boost, it
just seemed to max out a bit early. While changing the oil in preparation for
a track event this weekend, I noticed the accelerator cable had a fair amount
of slack at idle position.  I'd noticed this before, but it never really
registered.

This car had received anal retentive care by an anal retentive shop, so I assu
med (yeah, I know, I know) the cable was properly set.  Just to check, I had
my wife come out and floor it (engine off).  I still had nearly a quarter
inch of travel on the throttle arm!  My throttle position sensor was sensing
I didn't want full boost, so I wasn't getting full boost.

Made the adjustment, and took 'er out for a flight!  14 psi at max, bleed-off
to 11.5!  I've had this car six months, and I'd never experienced full
throttle acceleration.  This sucker runs like a scalded dog!!

There's no sense in being stupid unless you show it every once in a while!
 For those of you who are looking for ways to increase the horsepower of your
P-car in a cost-effective manner, with no sacrifice in reliability, check the
throttle cable.  You might pick up ten or twenty horses for nothing!
