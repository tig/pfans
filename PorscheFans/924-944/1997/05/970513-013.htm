wrong answer,

i am 18 and my 85.5 944 cost me about 650 every six months. however i am the 
expensive part not the car and my friends new daodge ram costs him 1200 every 
six months based on vehicle value not driver.  

p.s. all insurance is based on vehicle value and driver. to buy a new car would 
double maybe even triple the cost.

p.s.s call you insurance company and ask they are more than willing to help you 
if they think you are going to pay them in the end.
