<<The 944 engine is not so much better as we would like
to believe.   The oil cooler, rod bearing lubrication, water pump, and
timing belt engineering, etc., should be considered an embarrassment
to the myth so-called superior German engineering.>>Sez Dave

Jeeze Dave:
  You really know how to piss in a guys Wheaties, buddy!  

  You obviously know what you're talking about, which brings a question to

Just out of curiosity. What is (in your humble opinion) a well engineered
motor in the genre or level of performance cars that we talk about in this
forum?

   Thanks,
