Hi Trevor,

I don't think you should have any perceptible radial play at the stub =
axle.  Radial as in an ability to move it along the radius from the axle =
centreline, right?

It should however have play in the turning direction, e.g., as you grab =
the halfshaft and twist it.  This is called backslash and is established =
between the ring and pinion gears.  Spec is 0.10 to 0.20 mm at about 75 =
mm from axle centreline.  I will warn you that just about every 944 =
transmission I've touched has more than spec, typically anywhere from =
0.30 to 0.50 mm, although I've seen higher.  The reason/problem is that =
with these transmissions, it appears to be possible to get a centred =
wear pattern in the ring & pinion set-up if the backlash is set high.

If your play is indeed radial, I'd take the CV joint off the stub axle, =
then check the bolt holding the stub axle to the differential through =
its centre.  If it is loose, back it out, clean it, dab of red Loctite, =
torque to 25 Nm.  Locate the stub axle during torquing by slipping a =
3/16" drift through one of the CV bolt holes and up to the case.
