<please excuse me repeating the issue, but:

<1. is there a correct amount of slack that the accelerator cable is
   supposed to have at idle?

I had some free time this weekend and decided to check the slackness or
lack thereof of my own throttle cable (951).  Yes there was quite a bit of
slack, so out come the 13mm open wrenches.  It appears that the best
tension on the cable is achieved by feel and using the throttle position
sensor (TPS) as a guide.  The TPS will click when actuated - if you push on
the throttle cam you will hear a distinct click as the TPS starts its
travel.  So my reasoning was to adjust the tension with just enough slack
to prevent the click (TPS actuation) in its resting position.   I remember
having a problem with a too tight cable a few winters ago because it was
adjusted in the previous summer and when it got cold, there was no slack.
The consequence was engine stalling on braking - the engine was still
getting fuel even when I was off throttle and on the brakes.  So leave
enough slack to prevent this.     

<2. is the throttle arm the only adjustment to make in this regard

For the proper operation of the throttle, I believe this is all one can
adjust.
 
<3. during a smoothe normal acceleration, I can feel very slight hesitation in
   engine as I accelerate, but in very hard and agressive acceleration I don't
   get any hesitation and my speed increases very smoothly - is this related
   to my cable needing some adjustment - I don't know what else could cause
   this, because my car behaves the same way even after a major tune up
service

This appears to be an unrelated problem - to the cable tension- but you
should check and clean the contacts on the connector to the TPS, also apply
some dielectric grease when you are done.
