Your insurance agent is WRONG. Autocrossing does not void ANY automobile
insurance. He simply didn't understand what autocrossing is. Because you
actually asked him about it, I doubt if you do either.

IMHO, Your insurance carrier should give you a DISCOUNT. The whole idea
of autocrossing is that the driver and car are exposed to less hazards
than those encountered during normal driving while not exceeding normal
driving speeds. So not only are you minimizing his exposure while
autocrossing, you are gaining invaluable experience in what to do if and
when you actually have a bad highway experience.

Now I'm talking about sanctioned SCCA or PCA events and the
more-respectable clubs. (Always ask to see the event insurance policy
prior to competing if you do not know or trust the organizers.) I'd stay
away from events that are thinly disguised street racing. These
'autocrosses' are accidents waiting to happen and may eventually kill
the sport due to a bad incident.
