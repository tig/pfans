Hey List Members,

With some measure of regret, I am putting up my '87 951 for sale.  I'm =
getting married in June, and we've got bills to pay, a house to sell, a =
house to buy, etc.  I would like to give the PorscheFans a chance at the =
car first before I put the car in the AutoTrader.

Some Details....

Guards Red with Black Leather Interior
54K miles
New timing & balance shaft belts and rollers @ 47K miles (by Porsche =
dealer)
Weltmeister Chipset (0.9 bar)
New Dunlop D40M2 tires @ 52K
K&N air filter
New Water Hoses and Accessory Drive Belts ( OEM Porsche )
Swepco Transmission Fluid @50K
New Motor Mounts @53K
New Brake Master Cylinder and Brake Pads @48K
Blaupunkt CD125 Cambridge CD Player
New Floor Mats and Car Cover
Oil Changes every 3K miles ( Castrol 20W-50 / 10W-40 Summer / Winter )
Numerous other goodies too!

The car is very solid...no squeaks or rattles.  It runs very strong and =
EVERYTHING works. The interior has only one flaw and that is a 1 inch =
tear in the passenger seat at the front right seam where it is sewn.   =
Otherwise, the interior is perfect.  The car was purchased by my father =
at an insurance auction as a wrecked car.  It was damaged on the =
driver's side front, but the damage was not too severe, at least not as =
severe as most cars he has repaired in the past.  The radiator, air =
conditioning condenser, and intercooler were NOT damaged, to give you an =
idea of the severity of the collision.  Air Bags did not deploy.  We =
replaced the left fender, front polyurethane nose, one headlight cover, =
and the header panel between the headlights.  Everything else was =
repairable, even the hood.  The fender and nose cap were salvage parts, =
the rest of the parts were from Porsche.  BTW, the car was purchased at =
an Atlanta Porsche dealer originally, so it's seen a corrosion-free =
southern life.

And Finally....the price is $10K, firm.  The car is in Warner Robins, =
Georgia about 20 miles south of Macon GA.

If you are interested, e-mail me for more details.  I have a detailed =
list of information about the car, but don't want to clutter up the list =
with a lot of sales info.

Regards,

J. Dean Roberson
