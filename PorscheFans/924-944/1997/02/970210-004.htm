Hello fellow Porsche fans:

I am a long time fan of  the 911 and the 944.  Being that the 911 is out of
my price range at the moment, I am seriously thinking about purchasing a 944
or 944T.  My previous German car exposure was a 65 VW Bug.  I am very aware
that the Bug and the 944 are very different in terms of performance and in
service.  I have spoken to several people who given me tid bits of info. on
the 944 and their reputation in the service shop.  I would appreciate some
tips on... 

1) What to look for when seeking out the right 944.
2) What years to avoid.
3) What is the basic cost of maintaining the car per year (ball park figure).
4) Is the 944T more costly than the 944 to maintain.
5) What does the turbo do exactly besides make the car go faster.
6) Am I getting into something in which I should wait until I get older (I am
21) 

These are a few questions that if answered, I would know what to do next in
my quest for this fasinating automobile.  Every 944 owner I have spoken to
says that they enjoy their automobiles very much.  I am looking to spend
between 5 and $8000 on this car, however I am aware that later on down the
road my costs will exceed the tens of thousands.  By the way, I am a college
student at UC Berkeley and have a stable 'ok' paying job. I hear that you
must have alot of money to waste on these cars.  Thank you very much in
advance for the responses and help with my endeavor.
