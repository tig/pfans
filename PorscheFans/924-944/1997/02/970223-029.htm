Hi-I'm a new member and am very close to purchasing a porsche.  I was
looking for a little guidance from anyone that knows about the 1988 944
Turbo S.  Specifically, the seller has told me that the car that I'm
interested in is a limited edition of the Turbo S (he told me that there
were less than 200 made).  It is a pinkish campaign color with a nasty
plaid interior.  It also has the Turbo S wheels.  It is identical to the
944 featured in the February 1988 edition of EXCELLECE. Can anyone tell
me more about this car?  Is there such a thing as a limited edition
Turbo S (i.e. what more does it have than the 944 Turbo S - other than
the hideous interior)?  Will this car command a premium?  How much will
a performance chip add to the value?  Is this a "Turbo Cup" car?  How
can I be sure this is a Turbo S? Any information would be greatly
appreciated.  Also I would appreciate if any members could recommend a
mechanic (in the New York metropolitan area).  Thanks for any help that
you can provide.

                                     MDK
                                     (ElyseK@Prodigy.net)
