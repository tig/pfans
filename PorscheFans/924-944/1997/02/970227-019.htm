My 86 944T started leaking coolant about two days ago. I have pulled the intake out, peeked under
the upper belt cover, and looked from underneath as best I could with flashlight and inspection mirror
in hand.  I've traced it to the neighborhood of the water pump (big surprise) but with all the mechanicals
in the way, I can't see where it is coming from; against the block or from the pulley seal.  Other than the
leak, the pump seems to work fine, and the car does not overheat, even with the water level way down.
Does anyone have any advice, other than to take it in to the shop?  

Has anyone replaced a water pump themselves, either with or without the belt tensioning tool?  That 
stupid belt tensioning is the only thing I can do myself, and I sure like to replace that myself.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Chris Hand
