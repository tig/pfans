Hello Chris -- my factory alarm stopped beeping recently and I got to 
its innards this weekend to fix it. In my car the alarm unit is behind 
the stereo mount, right on top of the drive-tube cover (the hump). It is 
accessible from the passenger side footwell. You will have to slide the 
unit back and forth to unclip it, and then pull it towards you on the 
passenger side.

If the wires your PO tapped for her stereo were indeed the alarm wires, 
it should be a thick harness of six wires in one group and 2 in another, 
in one black insulation shell. It would not be my choice for tapping for 
reasons of safety and physical location (this harness is not really 
close to the steering column), so I would double-check that these are 
the right bunch of wires by following the leads from the back of the 
alarm to your burned insulation.

If this is the problem set of wires, simply unplug the alarm control 
unit. The alarm works on a pole-circuit principle -- pulling it out of 
the circuit will not disable the engine. In any case it works by 
disabling the fuel pump, not the starter -- so your engine should turn 
over and then die even if the alarm is on.

Check all your fuses too, including in-line fuses on the harness that is 
shorted. If getting rid of the alarm unit and replacing fuses does not 
work it is almost certainly not the alarm wires that were damaged. About 
the alarm control unit itself, mine had a small patch of solder 
burnt/evaporated from the PCB and took 10 minutes of patience to 
rebuild. Alarm works fine now.

Sounds like you made a killing on the car -- how much _did_ you buy it 
for?! Let us know how your electrical detective work goes.
