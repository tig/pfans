> My questions are:
> 
> 1) Is the car worth ~$3500 I'm going to offer for it?

	If it were me, no. I see a lot of 944's from
	this era in this price range and alot of them
	turn out to be disasters waiting to happen.
	This car can get expensive very fast.


> 2) Can I fix this thing myself for a reasonable price?

	Depends on what you mean by reasonable. You can
	probably do the labor yourself but the parts are
	expensive. Routine maintenance is also expensive
	compare to most other cars.

> 3) Can I spend more time driving it than fixing it?

	Maybe, if you get lucky.

> 4) Are the problems I have noticed normal for this car at this age and
> mileage?

	Yes, for a fairly poorly maintained 944. I firmly believe
	there is no creature more evil on earth than a poorly
	maintained 944.


> 5) What other pit-falls are there I should watch out for?

	The clutch, water pump, steering rack, timing belt,
	all other belts and associated rollers, motor mounts,
	etc. Any one of these could go on a car in this condition
	and at the very least would set you back big bucks. At the
	worst, some of them could destroy your engine :(

	I hope I'm not too late. Save up another 3-4K and buy a
	later model in better shape. Good luck!
