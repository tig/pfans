Hi Garry,

This sounds like it is probably a hose.  You might want to pop the hood and
look at the hoses going to and from the coolant reservoir (driver side).  Also
look at the upper radiator hose.  Since it sounds like a leak that only occurs
while the system is pressurized, one of the hoses could have cracked at the
connections, so when the system is hot and pressurized, water is forced out of
the offending hose.

Other possiblities are:  You have a cracked radiator or a cracked reservoir,
both of which are somewhat expensive to replace (but not as much as a water
pump).
