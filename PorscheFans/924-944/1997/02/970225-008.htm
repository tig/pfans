  It is time for me to replace the transmission on my porsche:
944
1985 1/2
230K miles

I have had the vehicle for ~4 months.  It is difficult to shift into 2nd, 
feels like two-three friction points, and is to a lesser degree difficult to 
shift into other gears.  Sometimes it is even difficult to shift out of gear 
(somewhat related to using the trany as an e-brake on slight inclines, yes I 
will be replacing the e-brake pads).  About 500 miles ago, I changed to Mobile 
1 75W90 gear oil which helped a bit (that little drain plug magnet sure does 
catch a lot of metal!).  With double clutching, and warm weather, I can 
minimize the shifting problems, but I would rather enjoy my vehicle a bit 
more. I have been advised by many sources that rebuilding may become expensive 
as it is likely that most of the internal parts are severely worn.

Will a used turbo transmission would fit this vehicle?  I am considering the 
following options:

1) used 944 transmission                    <$1,000
2) used 944 turbo transmission               ??
3) having my transmission rebuilt            $1,100 -> $1,700 + shipping
4) rebuilding my transmission                $parts?, $special tools?, time?

Any and all advice is appreciated!!

Thanks,

'85.5 944, red, 230k, (sitting in garage waiting for warmer weather and some 
repairs)

P.S. I have been following this list for about a month now.  What a great 
resource!  I enjoy and look forward to reading the messages every day, and am 
continually becoming more of a porsche addict...
