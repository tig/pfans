Alas, finally a group of folks that aren't going to laugh at me and tell me
what a stupid thing it was to buy my 1980 Porsche 924 Turbo.  Even tried to
sell her once, but she has a few problems that the prospective buyer didn't
want to venture into, (besides the fact that he never finished paying me),
so she's happily back at home in my driveway.

Okay, so I'm finally done lurking and am ready to ask the questions I've been
holding onto.  I'm sure that most of these have already been addressed her,
some I've caught the tail end of.  But please help me out with what you can.
I'm getting ready to invest more money into her in April, (I'm having
someone else do the work for me due to lack of time), and I'm trying to
gather as much info as possible.

        1.  Clutch.  Now that I've been lurking around for a bit, I'm pretty
sure that
        I have the answer to this one, but on the off chance that there's a
workaround
        to get her going in the meantime ....  no clutch.  Dead to the
floor.  We've   
        replaced the master and slave cylinders, and I'm assuming that we're
going to 
        have to go with the complete clutch.  Anything I can try out in the
meantime?

        2.  Problems at operating tempurature.  These may or may not have been
        fixed. She's been tuned up and a timing problem was fixed while she was
        on "vacation".  What happens is, once the car has warmed up to operating
        temperature (after about an hour or so of driving), it intermittedly
goes wacko.
        By that I mean the tach goes crazy and engine power fluctuates
irradically.
        It's usually all I can do to get her home.  Once she sits for a day
or two, she's
        fine for a while again.

        3.  Odometer.  (I think I saw the tail of this here).  Yes, I was
uninformed
        enough to hit the trip odometer while the car was in motion.  Apparently
        a big mistake.  So, now, no speedometer, or odometer.  Is there
something
        short of the odometer shop I can do to fix this?

Thanks in advance, it's nice to be back in the game, but I'll be a lot
happier when she's on the road again.

Oh, and anyone in the area know of a good mechanic (just in case my buddy
bails).

1980 Porsche 924 Turbo, and glad to have her home.
