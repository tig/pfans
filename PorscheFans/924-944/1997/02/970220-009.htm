The rotors I bought from Vertex were original equipment rotors. I also
bought the original equipment plug wire set from them and saved a bundle. I
don't know why they are so much cheaper, but I have no complaints about the
quality of the parts I bought.

Metalmasters are fairly good street pads, don't squeal much, are not very
dusty, and even work at the track to some extent. The biggest problem with
them for street use in a 951 is that the rear pads tend to rattle (I have
yet to figure out why the front pads don't rattle, but they don't). The
backing plate on other pads is slightly larger, thus no rattle. The fix [as
described in a thread in Porschephiles (RIP) about a year ago] is to cut a
strip of thin sheet aluminum the depth of the pad and shim the pad from the
bottom with the strip. Even if the aluminum rubs on the rotor, it won't do
it any harm. Otherwise, the rattle will DRIVE YOU CRAZY!

I use Metalmasters for street driving (with the shims) and change to Hawk
racing pads for track events.
