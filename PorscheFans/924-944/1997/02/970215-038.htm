Hi gang,
My last post was regarding a "new noise" from what I thought was the rear of the car, 
resembling a "lightly dragging muffler". (Which it isn't, of course)

Well, today, after careful research (driving slowly alongside a concrete wall), I suspect 
that this is:
a.)Not only occurring in one gear as previously thought, but at least 1st and 2nd.
b.)It is probably not coming from the rear, but the from engine/clutch area.(It is not the 
brakes)
c.)Most noticeable when gas is being applied, maintaining a slow speed or when accelerating 
hard from 1st or 2nd.
d.)It is intermittent, and hard to hear except at slow speeds,echoing againt a wall (or 
accelerating occasionally).
My thoughts were that it sounds almost exactly like when the Catalytic converter went south 
on my Plymouth, or something just rattling at a resonant frequency w/ the engine. Does this 
sound like an exhaust leak, bad Cat converter or (hopefully not) bad bearings (throw out or 
pilot) in my clutch ???? $$$$$$ :-(
(I wish I could attach a .WAV file.....)

TIA...
-Neil
Otherwise perfect 87 944 w/ 70% left on the clutch...
