Chris,  sure sounds like it is the water pump.  They can leak
sporadically.  The down side to leaving it alone is that they can
suddenly just let go, and then leave you stranded.  I have worked on
944's (street and racing) since 1983, and know that the problem will not
just go away.  I would not suggest milking it for awhile.  It is not a
technically difficult job, but there are some specifics that should
always be done.
1)  Replace t-stat and o-ring  2) Replace hose to heater line, check
other rad. hoses  3) Check all rollers, cam & aux belt (if reused, put
them back on in the same driving direction.  4) Very good time to
replace cam, crank, and balance seals.  5)  Be sure and bleed the
cooling system.  6)  If the bolts and studs are rusty holding the pump
on, you might consider replacing them, before they break.  7)  many
other potential things, but you only get the knowledge from working on
them every day.
Good luck   Don Istook   Maverick region
