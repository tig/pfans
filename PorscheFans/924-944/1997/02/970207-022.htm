Hey there..
       First day logged on newsgroup.  Hope all you smart 
Porschefiles out there can help.  
       I just bought my first Porsche-82 924 Turbo.  My "friend" sold 
it to me cheaply; he needed the cash, and all it had was a blown turbo
..  As a testament to the truths of Murphy's laws (and my stupidity), I 
found upon disassembly that 3 pistons had cracked skirts and shattered 
rings.  In addition, the head had started to melt.  I later found out 
that this guy was running more than 1 bar boost with Euro (8:1) 
pistons (yes, he's already done this once) and no intercooler.  Let's 
not even talk about the rest of the car.
       Now that I've gotten it all apart (in my bedroom, no less), I 
have several questions:
1)  I'm buying the spec book, but I'm putting the head back together 
this weekend.  Anyone know the clearance specs, and can I do it w/ 
head unbolted from block?  Should I even try?
2)  Can I reuse intake and exhaust manifold block studs?  I assume I 
should get new nuts.
3)  Is there any advantage to using the new $50 (!) nuts on turbine 
intake, or should I just get new studs and nuts?
       I'm taking the block out Sat. at 7AM.  Feel free to drop by 
and help(yeah, right!).  I can use any rebuilding and/or initial 
tuning advice you have.  Please feel free to mail me direct, as well.
Thanks!

                               Dave 8^)
                               lazarus.david@gainesville.va.gov
