Here is my 2 cents worth.  Breaks and steering are the two most important
items on a car.  If you suspect that your breaks and rotors are nearing the
end of their useful life, then replace them before you reach yours.  Just
do it.

This is a do it yourself project.  Front rotors are about $80.00 each for
your car and the rear rotors about $60.00 each.  Break pads are even much
less.  All you need are a few basic hand tools, Craftsman impact
screwdriver (costs about $12.00), Haynes Service manual ($15.00), and some
jack stands.  It will take the first time mechanic (you) about two hours to
complete the job.  Get yourself some surgical gloves to keep your hands
clean (buy a bunch they rip easily) and follow the directions.  When you
finish, stand upright, beat your chest, and go test the breaks (some place
deserted, the pedal may need pumping the first time).  You will be proud of
yourself and you deserve it.  End cost is about 1/2 what you were quoted.

Good Luck,

Marv
