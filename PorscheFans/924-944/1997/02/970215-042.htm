I have the exact same noise but only at idle (as far as I can tell) 
and not all of the time.  I have written it off as problems with a 
poorly engineered clutch disk (smaller springs have broken or come 
loose) and will fix it by putting a cup car disk in soon.  I am 
anxiously waiting other ideas.

Hi gang,
My last post was regarding a "new noise" from what I thought was the 
rear of the car,
resembling a "lightly dragging muffler". (Which it isn't, of course)

Well, today, after careful research (driving slowly alongside a 
concrete wall), I suspect
that this is:
a.)Not only occurring in one gear as previously thought, but at least 
1st and 2nd.
b.)It is probably not coming from the rear, but the from engine/clutch 
area.(It is not the
brakes)
c.)Most noticeable when gas is being applied, maintaining a slow speed 
or when accelerating
hard from 1st or 2nd.
d.)It is intermittent, and hard to hear except at slow speeds,echoing 
againt a wall (or
accelerating occasionally).
My thoughts were that it sounds almost exactly like when the Catalytic 
converter went south
on my Plymouth, or something just rattling at a resonant frequency w/ 
the engine. Does this
sound like an exhaust leak, bad Cat converter or (hopefully not) bad 
bearings (throw out or
pilot) in my clutch ???? $$$$$$ :-(
(I wish I could attach a .WAV file.....)

TIA...

Otherwise perfect 87 944 w/ 70% left on the clutch...
