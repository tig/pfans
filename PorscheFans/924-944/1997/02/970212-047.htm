I need a new set of tires in a few months, and many of you have been very
helpful in making suggestions to me as to which brands/types have worked for
you.  As if choosing from among the dozens of tires on the market today
wasn't hard enough, I need to decide if I want to buy 225/245's instead of
the 205/225 sizes that are recommended and came as stock rolling equipment
on my car.  I have heard from some of you that increasing the width on the
same size rim may not be "optimal" for the sidewalls.  Does this mean that
the sidewalls will be somehow stressed more during cornering or something?
Besides the aesthetic differences (the wider tires definitely make the car
more aggressive visually), what else can I expect from widening my tires?
Will it increase/decrease handling on my 951, or cause the steering or
suspension assemblies to wear faster?  Some of you have already replaced
your tires with fatter ones and have not associated any problems with having
switched.  In case it's important, I have the 16" deeper-dish (meaning no
ABS) phone dials.  I would greatly appreciate any advice regarding this
matter.  Thanks...

I am looking for a 924 Engine in good condition. I would like to put it
into my '79 924 and then recondition my original engine at my own pace.

Regards
Atholl
