	Khalid,

	Performance Products is correct about Chevron Pro Guard.
	I've used it the last 20K in my 944 with no problems. I
	haven't noticed any kind of performance difference but
	I also haven't had any clogged injectors. If I remember
	correctly, Bruce also recommends it. What the hell, it's
	cheap insurance. As far as octane boosters, I wouldn't try
	that. Just go to one of those specialty gas stations
	that actually sell super high octane gas.
