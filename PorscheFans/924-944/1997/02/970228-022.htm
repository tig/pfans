I haven't been paying real close attention to this thread and my 944 is
older (and non-turbo), BUT, I did have a starter problem not too long ago
and I've had starter problems with other cars.  In just about every case
the actual starter motor itself never goes bad-- it's always the solenoid.
What may be happening is that when you hit the key, a magnetic field is
created around what amounts to a large chunk of metal.  The magnetic field
makes the piece move and it makes contact with some heavy-duty contacts
which route power along those massive battery cables directly to the
starter motor.  Bad or no connection by the solenoid means no power to the
starter.

If you have grease that is more dirt than anything surrounding your
solenoid, by maintaining the power to the magnetic field you may be getting
the solenoid to "inch" along the last few tenths of an inch until it makes
contact.  In some cars, you can rapidly "pop" the solenoid into action by
rapidly hitting and releasing the key from start mode until it finally
catches.

Bottom line: it seems like what everyone is saying about the solenoid is
right-- it's most likely the problem.  And the only fuses involved with any
starting system have to do with relays between the key and the solenoid and
I don't recall the Porsche having any such thing.  Good luck!
