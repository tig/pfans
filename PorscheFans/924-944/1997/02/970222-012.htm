Just thought I'd add a little experience of my own to the old "Lipshy
thread" though it's not near as bad. I've been reading about everyone
else's experience with the unveiling of the Boxster at local dealerships
and I've been really jealous since I knew nothing like that would happen
here. Today was the Maverick Region new members party held at Town North
Porsche in Dallas. I dropped by for a bit and was looking around the
showroom at the rather pitiful collection of 993's they had when the
salescreature nearest me picked up the phone when it rang. It was
obviously a friend of his on the other end because of his relaxed
attitude. Apparently, this friend asked him what was going on at the
dealership because his response was "...oh, we've got this Porsche club
new member's party today...it doesn't really do anything for us, but hey.
maybe we'll sell something to somebody..." Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll never
buy anything from Town North, that's for sure. Dealerships and associated
salescritters give me the *creeps*!
