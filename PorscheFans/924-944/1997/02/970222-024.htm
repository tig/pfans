	Actually, you're not the only one. I have this dream you see...

	My significant other is the financial supporter of my Porsche
	habit. She figures it's cheaper and less deadly than coke
	or heroin (hah!). I was told, "...yes, dear, you may have
	your 951 and your 930 as soon as we have our new house..."
	To this, I readily agreed since I did not want to keep those
	cars outside, and began thinking of plans for a 5 car garage.
	Currently, we are looking for the house. On to the dream...
	I am going to find an '89 951 in near concours condition (as
	low miles as I can get) and I'm going to ship that sucker
	straight to Andial for the stroker kit, larger turbo, wide
	ring gasket, big red calipers, and whatever else I can think
	of. Then I am going to make it my personal mission to destroy
	any and every japanese and american pretendo sports car that
	pulls up to a light and revs their engine. The world will be
	mine. Bwahahaahahaha! Well, that's one of the things I'm going
	to do with it anyway...
