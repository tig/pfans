I had the same problem with one of my taillight on my previous 924 after it
had been very badly "fixed" after a motor-cycle ran into me at a traffic
light. At first I simply tightened the screws a little but that didn't
help. BTW: be very careful not to tighten them to hard ! It didn't happen
with me, but I wouldn't be surprised if you'll have to buy a new unit if
you do !

Anyway, that (of course) didn't help much... Then I simply unscrewed the
whole unit (6 nuts if I'm nut mistaken), disconnect the wires and remove
it. It's possible that it's sticks to the car very tight, be careful when
you pull it out. I don't know how Porsche originally sealed the units, but
I think simply using kit (is it call "kit" in English ?). Anyway, I hate
that stuff, one can never get something off and on again with it, so I
glued some foam-rubber strips along the rims of the unit (some places a
little thicker). Then I simply placed the unit back in. End of problem.

My dad also said: "just drill a few wholes here and there, that'll fix
it"... but he's always real easy with things like that... always hardhanded
(breaking a lot more than needed) and screwing up things badly sometimes...
I don't like the idea of having holes in my car, other than were there
originally. And I don't like it if there's "no way back" and it's a "one
shot chance"... But that's my personal opinion of course.

Anyway, what I want to say is that it really not difficult to really fix
the problem at the root...
