Hey Farzaan-

I'll bet you 2:1 it's the solenoid.  Just went through similar situation w/
my 911.  The new battery, being FULLY charged, provided enough extra oomph
(pronounced current) to pull that sticky solenoid through the corrosion in
the cylinder to engage the starter - for a couple of days!  Replacing the
starter was the permanent solution.  911's are particularly sensitive to
current drops due to long cables (front of car to rear).

I got a new Bosch starter for $94.00 from an automotive electrical shop.  The
best price from ANY automotive parts supplier was $184.00.  Checked w/ the
electric shop, and they had rebuilt for $84.00, new for $129.00.  We looked
at the rebuilt, and it was actually new.  The tech said Bosch does that when
they're backorder on rebuilts, they just ship new product instead.  If you
can't source a cheap starter locally, drop me a note, and I'll check here for
you.
