	Sam, stop. Before you throw away 5 grand on items of dubious
	merit, take that money and spend it on as much track time and
	professional instruction as you can get. Tacking on a bunch
	of junk to the exterior of the 944 engine isn't going to do the
	interior of the engine any good; that's where the real work 
	should go. You'll never catch the JATO armadillo that way.
	But when the big haired women see what an awesome driver you
	are because you spent all that money at a driving school, you'll
	have to beat them off with a stick. My 2 cents...
