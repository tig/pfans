If the car is in LA and the lady is uh....Asian...and it is in a storage lot, 
it is NOT a turbo!!!!!  It was not her "driver", she has a number of salvage 
cars there and she is full of s--t.  She couldn't tell a 944Turbo from a 
Huyndai sedan.  It is a 944 normal that's not worth the 5K she says she wants 
for it.  She has been told it's not a turbo but still insists it is......She 
advertises on the net through the "Recycler".  I suspect she buys the cars at 
auction, this can also be done with net access for lists of cars about to be 
auctioned, then go and buy 'em and scam a sale to the unknowing........ 
 
Dangerous combination, sleazy broad, computer, modem and a few bucks....... 
 
Your welcome, 
Ted

Hey, go for it. There is no problem that cannot be solved by spending
enough time and money.  :-)

Honestly, my advice to anyone who is contemplating a swap like this is
to not do it... If you want a 944 Turbo Cab, fly to Germany, buy one, 
import it and be done with it (probably only spending an extra ten or 
twelve grand to make it happen...)

But, then, hey, nobody takes my advice anyway...


Good Luck!
