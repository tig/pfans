On my '87 951, the airbag warning light stays on after the "bulb test" delay.  
I've taken it to a dealer (normally I use independents or my own devices-- with 
the airbag, I like having the dealer's hide involved), where they used a 
troubleshooting procedure outlined in the 944 Service Manual.  The tests use a 
jumper wire connected to a set of wires located in a connector in the passenger 
footwell.  There is a specific sequence of steps, and you must use a watch with 
a second hand to get the right fault codes.  The fault code for my car 
indicated a bad crash sensor on the passenger side.  This is attached directly 
to the car's body way up under the dash with special nuts, requiring a special 
tool (I think they are called "rip nuts").

I have obtained the part (from another dealer, at a discount), and will have it 
installed soon.  I looked at the Service Manual while at the dealer, and there 
is a sequence of steps to reset the system once the new part is installed.  
This is supposed to make the light go out.  We tried the procedure before 
further troubleshooting, and the warning light wouldn't go out.  I hope that 
the new part fixes the problem so that I can drive with more piece of mind.
