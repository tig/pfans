Derron -

I personally like the fish idea, but I think it would be a little tough
feeding them every day.  The water probably came from one of three spots. 
The first and not very likely is from the inside.  You don't live in one
of the recent flood areas do you?  The second and most likely is that the
outside seal around the lense is not tight.  You can try tightening the
bolts/nuts on the inside and pull the lense tighter to the gasket/seal. 
The third and somewhat likely is that the drain tubes for the rear hatch
pin latches have come loose and the water is pouring down onto the lense
assenmbly on the inside and then draining into the lense assembly. 

On an old 924 I had a number of years ago, I couldn't get the lense to
seal and just drilled one very small hole in the bottom of the each lense
on the outside so it would drain.  No one ever knew; not even the concours
judges.  Then again, it never made it to the Manhattan either.
