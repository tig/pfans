If you were promised 350 hp with your modification list, have them put it in
writing and don't write your check until you see the dyno results.  I am
building a 2.85 stroker and the computer says between 345 and 360 hp depending
on the various factors.  You can get 400 hp but wind up pushing the envelope.
If you are going to race, what you are doing will knock you out of the stock
class so you might as well go whole hog.  If you want me to forward copies of my
engine building journey (which is not finished), e-mail me back.

As a rookie driver, in hindsight, I would of first spent money on driving
school, then suspension and tires and then the engine.  I lucked out and have a
friend who lets me drive his S2 at events while mine is living in the shop.
