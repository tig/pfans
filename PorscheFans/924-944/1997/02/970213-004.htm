Well last night I pulled the computers out of the floorboard (not all 
the way, just to the extent of the cables).  The vacuum tube was not 
crushed but I was able to hand tighten the fastener a little more.  I 
test drove is for a short distance last night and had the same 
problem.  Today however the Turbo worked great all day.  Is it 
possible that the tube just had to build up a vacuum?  Is there a 
constant low pressure in the vacuum lines of these cars even when they 
are not running?  Anyway, the prior owner apparently had taken the 
computer stuff out before and it had all of three screws holding the 
whole assembly together.  It did not look like the stuff was mounted 
correctly.  Can anyone refer me to a picture of how the computers are 
supposed to be mounded to the metal plate behind the wooden 
floorboard?

Thanks
