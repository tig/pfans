Greg,

I've had similar problems in the past with my previous '84 944.  In my case, 
the problem only occurred when the car was hot and I tried to start it, but 
apparently it can happen to any of the old VW solenoids.   The starter reads 
the voltage in the solenoid to see if there is sufficient charge to start the 
car.  The old VW solenoids were problematic, and sometimes the starter does not 
get the right readings.  Perf Products or Automotion has a tech tip on this in 
their catalog.  They sold me for under $20 a second solenoid (actually a ford 
truck part) that I installed in serial (don't remember, might have been serial, 
it was almost 10 years ago and the brain, she ain't that good).  Call both, and 
one will know exactly what you are talking about.

The funny thing is that VW admitted to the problem, but at the time, I went to 
two dealers that said there was no such problem, nor did they have a clue on 
how to fix it without replacing a whole bunch of parts.

Had the thing in for 10 years, never a problem.
