	You could just as easily say that about anything that breaks
	and requires maintenance. You have to consider the car and what
	it was designed for. Apologies to the racers aside, the Porsches
	are racing cars straight from the factory. How many racing cars
	are there that are designed to go 100K on the engine/clutch/tranny
	without any kind of rebuild? I admit, the Porsche clutch is
	weak in this area, though. Now, on to your Honda, what is it
	designed for? To go from point a to point b slowly and cheaply.
	If you track your Honda, you will quickly find that you have
	misused it and now all you have is a pile of scrap. But, that's
	your fault because you used the car for a purpose it was never
	intended to be used for. The Japanese car companies would like
	you to think that the Miata, the 300 ZX, the Supra, and the RX-7,
	etc., are in the same class as the Porsche. Well, they're not.
	How many tracked 300 ZX's have the original engine and tranny
	in them? Not many, I'll bet. If you're gonna talk the talk, you
	better walk the walk and that means building a racing car that
	is really a racing car instead of an econobox in disguise.
	I know they can do it, just look at the NSX.

	Your comparing apples and oranges. The Porsches were never
	designed to go 90K with minimal service. Will your Honda
	do 150? And go from 80 to 0 in 55 feet? No, but that's not
	its fault because it was never designed to do that. If high
	maintenance is the reason some Porsches suffer from low resell
	value, then why don't Ferraris have low resell value? You can't
	drive a Ferarri 10 blocks without something breaking...

	That's I have my Volvo....

	Not exactly. They used Japanese *management* techniques in 
	building the Boxster. They didn't fire all those German engineers
	and replace them with their own.
