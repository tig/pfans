Hi all!

I've recent noticed (today in fact) that the macpherson strut assembly is
threaded on the bottom and allows for adjustment of spring compression (is this
standard on turbos?).  The nuts (lock nut, adjusting nut) on this assembly are
fairly big around, and have indentations in them (they are not standard hex-nut
variety, but round) as if some sort of toothed tool is used to adjust them.

The manual doesn't mention anything about this.  Does anyone know of the tool I
use to adjust the springs?

I noticed this when I was looking for some sort of ID on my front rotors.  I
need to know how large they are, and what type they are (I don't think they are
stock, they are large, and look greater than 12 inches)

Thanks!
