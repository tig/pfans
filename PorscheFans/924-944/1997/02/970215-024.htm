Porschefans:

I have noticed several times that owners of non-turbo 944s have written in
asking about upgrades to substantially increase the performance of their
cars.  The usual answer is that some improvement is possible, but if the
individual wants a substantially faster car he should trade up to a turbo.
 The car recommended most often is a 1988 or 1989 turbo S (I think I have
this right).

We recently have had a thread discussing the price of these cars throughout
Canada and the US, and it seems that they cost in the high teens or even over
$20K.  They are also quite rare.

They question I am leading to is why not recommend a 968 in this situation?
 That model is newer, has some significant improvements over the 944 series,
and makes 236 horsepower without a turbo.  It is extremely torquey, and I
feel that it is more pleasant to drive on the street.  The cost (for my 92 in
superb condition in December) is less than $20K.  The only downside that I
can see is that further modification to make more horsepower is limited
because of the lack of a turbo.  But realistically, the factory claimed 0-60
in 6.1 seconds and one of the major magazines in 92 got 0-60 in 5.6 seconds,
which seems plenty quick to me.  Top speed is 156 mph, again adequate in my
opinion for street use (!).

I don't mean to put down the turbos in any way, but I got rid of my mint 91
MR2 turbo  recently and I like the non-turbo performance of my 968 better.
 Any other opinions?  I think the group as a whole just forgets about the
968, probably because there are so few around.
