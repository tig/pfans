B.S.  It's your car, you can do whatever you want with it.  Airbags are a
supplemental restraint system.  You still need to wear a seat belt for
them to be affective.  To my knowledge there are no laws prohibiting
airbags being disconnected by the owner.  What you are talking about is a
switch to temporarily disable the airbag.  That must have a law because =
it
deals with cars at the manufacturing level.

Just curious... if airbags save lives why do you consider yourself lucky
to have a car without one?
