In response to Ronald Helzer's post:  87 944 turbo questions:
 Original post deleted for reduced bandwith.




#1 Seat switches: What seems to be the problem with the switches? These 
can be rebuilt and cleaned, aside from plastic parts being broken or 
missing. Finding these used may be a little tough because they are 
usually a part of the seat and sold as a complete unit.



#2 Middle of the roof switch:  this is a microswitch that completes this 
circuit when the roof is installed, preventing the roof latches from 
working. This is a very fragile unit and must be working properly for the 
lifting roof system to operate (the tab when depressed comes in contact 
with the microswitch. Misalignment of the switch will keep the roof from 
lifting. You should be able to hear a "click" when the tab is pressed. 


#3 This is the test point for the ignition timing sensor. The rubber flip 
cover and body are one piece and detoriate because of heat and age. Try 
your local hardware store for a rubber plug (quick fix) otherwise the 
sensor must be removed for replacement of the complete rubber body. 


#4 ???


#5 Non-retracting rear sun shade:  remove the pop rivets & replace the 
end caps, I used 4-40
   button head hex screws about 1/4" long for a replacement for the pop 
rivets. The shade         is spring loaded and takes four hands for this 
fix. (a little frustrating, I've been there.)


#6 Engine light not working: ignition must be on


#7 Are the windshield washers heated?: yes they are! As of the 1985/2 
model year, and so are the right and left mirrors with the defroster on.


#8 Intermittent cruise control: I have not had much experience in this 
area. The control unit (computer) is located behind the carpet next to 
left drivers foot. 


#9 Rear wiper upgrade? Ask George B. about this one, he may have all the 
necessary parts and installation advice for this upgrade


#10         Enjoy!!  It is worth every minute of your time. I think so.


Good Luck,

Mike Kehr
