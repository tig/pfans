There is no need for a rising rate fuel pressure regulator unless you have
some funky custom stuff done.  If you want to run rich for whatever reason,
you can get the 3.0bar FPR, takes about 15 minuts to swap and cost around
US$69 from Windward or Powerhaus.  I tried one on my car and it reduces
turbolag, but the car does run richer.

As for A/F mixture, there are two ways, one is instant and the other is
more precise.  You can use an A/F mixture gauge from K&N or Cyberdyne,
etc, etc, to attach to the O2 sensor.  It looks really easy to be hooked
up in the engine compartment.  This will give you instant read outs.
It's normaly for the lights to bounce while the car is in motion, only 
under WOT or load does it stay at one level.  Optimum power in a turbo
motor comes in at 13.5:1, but street reliability dictates that most
turbo cars should be run at 12.5:1 or if you are a bit more careful 13.0:1.
NA cars use 14.7:1 (or is that 14.5:1, I don't know, never owned a NA
car).  For more accurate readings over the long term, use an exhaust
temperate gauge available from VDO or HKS, etc.  The probe should be 
mounted as close to the turbo as possible.  Temp readings of 1350F are
good in taht area.  1550 or above means you are running too lean.
