HEY! I am a Lexington, Ohio native. Any questions or anything else I can
do to make your stay enjoyable, please let me know.

The town, unfortunately, is not the same since Buck's restaurant burned to
the ground-- great greasy food, low prices, race memorabilia posted all
over the walls--- and Bobby Rahal bought me a beer there when I was
seventeen years old. No kidding.

And even for a Podunk town, there are many ways to enjoy a family trip,
e.g. a very large public garden that will captivate your wife (but drive a
teenage son crazy) and a downtown in neighboring Mansfield (complete with
Brewpub!) that has made great strides in the past years. Honest.

Eagerly awaiting all takers--

--Ted Harlan
