Heard so much about Mobil 1 on this list that I decided to check my 
handy-dandy oil FAQ by Ed Hackett (don't remember the URL but I can 
email a copy to anybody interested) and found that Mobil 1 and AMSOIL 
consistently tie for top rank in viscosity, flashpoint, pourpoint (low) 
and ash content (low).

What surprised me was seeing brands like Castrol GTX (George B.?) 
Kendall, Pennzoil and Valvoline apparently dumping huge (compared to 
Mobil 1 and AMSOIL) quantities of ash in our engines, and with low 
viscosity indices and flashpoints, and high pourpoints. Believe it or 
not Chevron Supreme (didn't even know Chevron makes oil) and Spectro 
Golden are better in some parameters!

What I did not find was any mention of good old Mobil. Does anybody out 
there (other than old-fashioned me) still use dino Mobil and feel happy 
about its performance and feel happier paying $6 at the end of six 
months? My '84 944 has been on a diet of 10W-30 Mobil for 13 years and 
92,000 miles now and does not eat a drop of oil. At the end of 6 months 
or so I drain 6 quarts of Mobil that is almost exactly the same color as 
when it went in. Of course I have very different expectations of my car 
than some of the more track-happy list members, but does anybody know 
how Mobil stacks up against Mobil 1, and can anyone give me good reason 
to switch to Mobil 1?
