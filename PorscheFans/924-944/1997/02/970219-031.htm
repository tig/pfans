Hey everybody,

Surya brought up a good point about the 944 interior. It seems like
it's generally accepted that the 85.5-on dash style is "better" than
the earlier 924 type. I agree that it's more modern-looking, but I'm
really torn between the spartan sports-car look of the older type vs.
the pseudo luxury-car look of the later cars. I like both alot but I
think the early style is a little more ergonomically laid-out. I also
think alot of 944 people see the newer interior as one more step away
from the 924. Having had my troubles with my old 924, I could see
trying to forget about it. Ultimately, I guess it's left to personal
preference. Besides, they're all going to crack eventually anyway (if
they haven't already).
