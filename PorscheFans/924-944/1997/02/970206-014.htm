<< I drive the car about 5K mile per year, only in
 the summer, with 3-4 high speed driver's ed events per year. If I had the
 bucks, I'd get a second set of wheels and some R1's, but alas, I need to get
 some tires that will be an acceptable compromise for both street and track.

For 5,000 fair weather miles and a few driving events per year, you might
want to consider the TOYO Proxes RA1.  It's a DOT approved tire designed for
track use, 
but it's very durable (though not quite as sticky as the R1's).
I get about a dozen hard track days out of a set.  Until they're worn slick,
they're also pretty good in the rain. I'd bet you could get at least one year
of  the road and
track use you describe, as long as you don't drive on the street like you do
on 
the track!  They probably cost between $150 and $165 in your size, and you 
wouldn't need another set of wheels.

The other option you might consider is the new Yokohama 032 (or something
like that).  They're wear rated "80" vs. "30" or "40" for the TOYOS. I
haven't tried them myself.  Anyone else have any experience with them?
