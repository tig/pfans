-- [ From: Richard Luker * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

I hope the following helps with the problems, my experience is with my 86
924S - the later dash 944 models may have some differences.

1)	The 944 Haynes wiring diagram although drawn for the later 944 is almost
correct but difficult to understand, eg it is drawn showing one motor relay
box but my car has two separate up and down relays mounted near the roof
motor.

2)	The micro switch at the front of the roof panel just above the rear view
mirror is in the circuit to the open relay. It prevents the panel opening
too far and is a cause of many problems. At present I have it shorted out at
the connector near the motor and take care not to open the roof too far -
does anyone know how to access the front micro switch?

3)	The roof control switch has two change over contacts. One pair are for
normal open and close with the key in the ignition switch. The other pair
allow the operating arms to fully retract if the ignition key is removed.
The wiring bypasses the normal limit switch. For this to work correctly the
relay operated by the ignition key must be OK. In the older cars the relay
is called the RADIO RELAY and is mounted on the side of the heater behind
the radio. I found that the 12v was missing at the control switch and had to
fit a new relay. A breaker supplied a replacement for 9UKP but it is a
multifunction relay and would cost a lot from a dealer.

4)	All voltages can be measured at the plug next to the motor with someone
operating the switches. A 12v lamp with a couple of leads works just as well
as an expensive meter.

Best wishes and hope the UK english makes sense to my Porsche friends in the
USA.

Richard
