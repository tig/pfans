   I recently bought a 1979 924 Sebring edition.  It only has 76000 miles
but has been sitting for
around 6 years.  The transmission/torque tube had been removed for bushing
replacements but the previous
owner had been very methodical about labeling parts, etc and it all seems to
be here.  The trans/tube only
took about 4 hours to put in, but while jacking the car in the rear when I
tipped it up jacking the right
side gas leaked out of the fuel tank on the left side.  Removing the fuel
guage sender revealed a 3/4 full
tank of gas that smelled awful, and a lot of rust inside the tank.  I'm in
the process of removing the tank
....step 2 in the factory manual is to remove transmission!  I wish I had
looked in the book before bolting the
trans back in.  I've been following the digest for about a week now, and it
looks like I'm in for a riskier project than I'm used to.  So far I've
rebuilt mostly MG's and motorcycles.  For now I'd like help with a few
questions.
1)  The fuel gauge sender doesn't seem to work, as it indicated an empty
tank when in fact it was 3/4 full.
    when I removed it I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to work.. no
moving parts at all, it just looks
    like an aluminum tube sealed on both ends.  I'm just curious how it works.
2)  Besides fresh gas and sealing the rust in the gas tank any other advice
before a try to start this thing       up.  I'm planning to squirt some oil
in each cylinder and turn it over by hand several revs first, plus
changing the oil.

Thanks in advance for your help
