Hey guys and girls,

You guys were right (I hope).  I replaced the battery today.  The old battery
was actually giving me some problems besides the starting problem.
Every once in a while, the door chime would go all wierd and not sound right
when the door is open with the key in.  I tried to replace it with an 
Optima 800 battery which is an awesome unit, but it would not work unless
I modified the cabling and that was something I was not willing to do, so
I got a Diehard International battery that is seasled.  I don't want acid
dripping on the battery tray so I hope a sealed unit should prevent that
from happening.

The start problem occured three times yesterday and hasn't appeared since
I changed the battery today.  I hope (knock on wood) it's solved.  Thanks
for your help!

Farzaan.
89 951.

BTW - I recently found out that the PO installed the European fog lights!
These suckers are bright when aimed right.  He also changed the mains to
H4 lights.  I like my PO :)
