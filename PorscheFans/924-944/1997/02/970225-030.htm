Hi guys and gals.

I have had a plenty of success with my -85.5 944 repairs/detailing,
thank's to all of you!!
One question about sunroof, since it starts to be summer very soon..
Sun roof motor runs as switch is pressed, no movement..
I opened motor assembly in runk and noted that all gears in there are in
good shape.
Then I cleaned the whole thing, re greased it and put it back together,
pushed the switch in console and no difference in operation... Anyhow,
this sleeve where cable goes from motor to sunroof was moved two inches
towards the roof!!!
I tryed to move cable manually as owners manual tells, but it felt like
I have a wall ahead of me....Stuck...
Next I started to open interior roof panels and noticed that under those
panels is large peace of material wich covers whole roof inside(I don't
want to take that off. Usually once that has been stretched in place for
number of years, you can't get it in place without wrinkles...). 

Anybody had similar problems previously?
HELP. Summer is almost here!!

Thank you already for your help,

Juha Laine
