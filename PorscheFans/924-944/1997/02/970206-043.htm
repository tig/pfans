	Prepare thyself. This is gonna hurt most likely. The a/c switch
	(the snowflake switch) is much like the headlight switch only it's
	quite a bit simpler. The OEM replacement for that switch runs
	about $180 installed so this one may be through the roof. Can you
	get away with driving only during the day?
