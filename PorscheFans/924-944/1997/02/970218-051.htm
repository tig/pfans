I've had both... but not on a 944.  They were, dare I say, on my '92 =
Honda
Civic Si hatchback, running 195/50ZR-15s.

I had the D40M2s for 41K miles and they performed well, although the car
seemed to have a mind of its own at times and would change lanes for no
apparent reason.  This was in the dry or wet.  Overall the D40s were a =
bit
more twitchy and unstable compared to other tires I have had.  Others say
the opposite!  It's been a few years, but as I recall they were decent,
but not great in the rain.  Dry handling was quite good.  The Si is very
"tossable" and is great fun to drive quickly around town.  Personally, I
would not buy them again *for my car,* but that doesn' t mean you =
wouldn't
be happy with them.  I would spend the extra money on the SP8000s if you
want a newer design.

Changing to the SP8000s was a real eye opener.  Obviously going from bald
to new will be a big difference, but the 8000s immediately felt much more
secure.  They had very quick turn-in and even with only the faintest of
tread remaining the grip in the rain (which we get 9 months of the year)
was still good, much better than the stock Bridgestones when new!  When
the 8000s were new they were outstanding in the rain.  I put 43K miles on
them before switching to my current tires, Pirelli PZeros.

I really like the PZeros.  On my car, in my size, they are the best of =
the
bunch.  They don't seem to have the ultra quick turn-in of the Dunlops,
but overall they ride significantly better, are more quiet, and grip like
glue in the dry.  They seem to be about as good as the SP8000s in the wet
too.  I really like these tires because during normal driving I don't
notice them (I'm not fighting the car like I was with the Dunlops), but =
if
I want to go fast they just hang on.  Since I've only had them a couple =
of
months I can't comment on wear.  I don't expect them to last as long
because of their lower treadwear rating, but I didn't expect the Dunlops
to last long either so I could be wrong.

My experiences don't necessarily parallel those of 944 owners as I've =
seen
notes saying the D40M2s were very good on 944s.  For the money they are
hard to beat, even though the design is at least 5 years old.
