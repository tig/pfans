Hi Fans!
I am glad list seems to have settled down again after all this spam
nonsense. I have another question and would be grateful for any advice. I
have considerable backlash in my `82 924 transmission. There is noticeable
take up in the cv joints (shlack, shlack) which are to be replaced. The gear
change is smooth but the transmission whines. If I open the window while
driving and stick head out I hear an appalling grating sound like someone
else on this list described as "exhaust dragging on road". The transmission
whines more on deceleration. The question IS: Does a replacement used box
from a breaker (not rebuilt but apparently good) for 350 UK pounds make more
sense than a transmission rebuild. Is it possible from my description for
someone to guess what need to be done to rebuild my transmission, can the
work be carried out by me. I am a fairly competent mechanic despite much
swearing. Secondly, I am in Norway at present, are there any Norwegian list
members who can recommend a good source of new, used and aftermarket Porsche
parts.  Maybe I will just have to dig deep and buy a 944s or T! Great list!
Cheers, Iain
