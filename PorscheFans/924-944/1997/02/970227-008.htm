Hi Gary,

I'm surprised it's lasted that long, and that the T/O bearing is the 
problem. It seems that most of these cars have problems with the small
dampening spring breaking.

I (and a few of my friends, thanks John, Henry, and Bill) replaced my
clutch last month. It was not a terrible job, but as I'm sure you've
heard, takes a LONG time. Nothing is super complicated, and you don't
need many expensive tools. It's just that almost the entire underside
of the car has to come off. That takes time (and more time, and more
time, and ...) It took me probably 3 full 8 hour days of work. I also
cleaned and repacked my CV joints too, so that took some of the time.
My friends probably added another 2 full days work (after you discount
the time they spent eating lunch, BS'ing, and giving me a hard time).

I bought my clutch kit from Ron Horton at Eurospeed (credit to David
Johnson). It was a Sachs kit, with OEM parts. The price was $400. That
included the clutch disk, pressure place, throw out bearing, pilot
bearing and shipping. I could have gotten the same price from Sonnen
Porsche.

Looking back at it, I only had to replace the clutch disk. Two of the
small damping springs were broken. One had fallen out of the disk, and
was rattling around the assembly, preventing the clutch from completely
disengaging. However, once I went far enough to remove everything, I
thought it only prudent to replace the other components.

Since that time, I've heard that the spring breaking problem is fairly
common (credit Mike Mitchell). If I had more money, I would have bought
the "Turbo Cup" clutch kit. The clutch disk in that kit does not
contain the smaller springs.

> 3.  I gather my clutch disk uses rubber rather than steel springs.

No. You have springs. See above. 
 
> 4.  What other parts should be replaced at the same time with clutch,

If you can afford it, I would replace the disk, pressure place, t/o
bearing, and pilot bearing. If the flywheel has to come off for resurfacing,
then replace the rear oil seal behind it. My flywheel was fine.

If you decide to do this job yourself, let me know. The Mike Kehr FAQ
is an excellent source, however, I found some differences. Some made it
easier, and some required extra work. Also, I'll tell you how to make
the "Patented Potter Pilotbearing Puller".

Good luck,
