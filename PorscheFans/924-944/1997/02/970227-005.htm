Hi Lee:
Congratulations on getting your car into a publication.  Thanks for
the production information.  My copy of the 88 Pano on the TS is dog
eared and worn out for all the times I went over it before I got my
car.  There was also an article in Automobile comparing the TS with
the 930 that came out about the time I was looking.  I could almost
recite it verbatim back then.  Obviously, I was taken by what they
said.

Since '93 I also am the third owner, previous owners seemed to keep
the car garaged a lot. My car now has 37K miles (got it at 23K), I
had it lowered, but not to the nth degree, otherwise stock except for
the 33 bar rear brake proportioning valve I also put in, and the
Performance Friction pads I use on the track.  I acquired it just
after the Parade in Cincy. I have swapped out the factory sport seat
(40+ lbs as I recall) for a lightweight shell (17 lbs) on the track,
and used 5-point belts.

Previously I drove an 86 928S, and before that an 80 911SC.  I've
also sheltered a passel of 914s over the years.  Love to run Porsches
on the track.  So far, I've run Mid-Ohio and Putnam Park many times,
less often, RAmerica, RAtlanta, Watkins Glen, Sears Point, Grattan
Raceway, Indianapolis RP, Blackhawk Farms.  Yes, Mid-Ohio is my
"home" track, and I am a professor at U Cincinnati.

The TS has run Mid-Ohio, Putnam Park and Road America.
Its a wonderful car, as is, to dice with stock 930s and M3s, we've
even hung  with RS Americas.  Lee, I think I'm convincing myself to
keep it. Hard to think of another like performer for the money in the
current market.  

Good to chat with you. Let me know about the registry.  Thanks for
Mark Koestler's e.mail address.
