Hi,

911-GT1 :
  I just heard this on Autoweek on Speedvision, that Porsche
  has given the go-ahead to manufacture a limited run of 39
  911 GT1 at their racing division factory in Stutgart.
  Apparently they have 10 firm orders, and 40 other
  prospective buyers, for these 544 BHP cars, each priced at
  $925,900. 

  Of course, a PCNA spokesperson was quoked as "not being sure
  if these cars will be available in the US".

959 :
  Which brings me to the 959 thread that wouldn't die . :-)
  I saw a "C2 959 Speedster" on TV (their exact words, I am
  only reporting) being bid some $67,450 on the Barrett
  Jackson Auction coverage (rerun?) on Speedvision today.

  I was just rushing out the room when the 959 bodywork on
  the TV caught my eye, but I did not have the time to hang
  around for a pic of the bolt pattern on the wheels. (maybe
  the camera was told to avoid that sort of a shot ? :_)

924 :
  And why was I in such a rush ? Because my p-car is back on
  the road again. 

  I finally found the last 8 hours to complete the clutch
  project on my 924 I had begun in the fall. And I had some
  driving of my own to do, you bet!

After all, a real p-car in hand is worth any number of mythical
poseur-cars on TV, wouldn't you agree :-)

PS: Sorry, work pressures were to redline here with me the last
few weeks, and I am behind on pfan traffic by a couple of
months. My apologies to anybody who sent mail to me that I may
have missed, I promise I will catch up in a week or so now.
