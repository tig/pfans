hi Chris,

You have a turbo S, and they have adjustable front spring perches. This does
not adjust the spring compression, but does adjust ride height. With those
perches, you can easily corner balance the car, and / or adjust the front
ride height. 

I have heard that Porsche added the adjustments to make the car more comp-
etitive in racing, as the rules didn't allow modifying the front suspension,
and this way the car could be adjusted without changing parts.

They are probably stock. The 951S has BIG front rotors. According to my spec
book, the stock front rotors for the 951S is 304mm front, 299mm rear.

FYI, someone else posted about brake rotor thickness.
From the spec book:
Brake disk thickness new:
 Front  Turbo: 28mm
       TurboS: 32
  Rear  Turbo: 24
       TurboS: 24

Brake disk thickness Minimum
 Front  Turbo: 26.6
       TurboS: 30.6
  Rear  Turbo: 22.6

> Thanks!
