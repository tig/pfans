Chris,

Since an exhaust tip or any piece of metal beyond the muffler doesn't affect
exhaust performance besides maybe added/decreased resonance (and assuming
you're not going to block the exhaust passage), I would recommend adding a
tip to your aftermarket Borla system if you want a more familiar look to
your pipe.  I don't have a cat-back system yet, but I put an awesome new tip
on my 951 after I blew about 4 inches of the old original tip off!  I looked
long and hard for a tip that would last and looks as close to original as
possible.  What I came up with was the Genie 4.5" oval tip.  It is stainless
(304) steel with a polished finish (looks chromed- also available with a
more satin finish), and has a nice rounded lip to it.  It's only 10" long,
but an extension pipe is easy to install (but may not be necessary).  I used
an extension to push the tip an inch or two farther beyond the normal
position, and had my pipe welded for strength, but it can be safely
installed with the threaded bolt that's provided.  You would probably want
to weld it like I did for a stronger connection- the new tip is heavy!
Since it's 4.5 inches wide (3.5 inches tall), it's bigger than the stock
tip, and gives the car a subtly more aggressive look.  It fits larger
diameter pipes, so it was made for the 944 series.  Perfect match actually.
        I have seen them sold at Porsche race/service shops (obviously not
dealerships).  One company retails them here in the U.S., but the name of
the company escapes me at the moment.  Let me know how the Borla feels!
