I am 5 days new to this forum and about 7 months new to my '89 951.  I 
bought the car with the intent of doing much of the work myself but 
with time as short as it is...   Anyway, I have fallen prey to a 
couple of repair shops that "specialize" in Porsche cars.  These guys 
give a new low to the repair industry.  The first caused over $1000 
worth of damage "fixing" my AC compressor.  The one who cleaned up 
after him charged me for work that I do not believe was done and put 
400 miles and a dent in the right rear quarter of my car (the scary 
part is that I believe this guy is an instructor for the Peach State 
PCA).  Needless to say, the dealer is now the only place that works on 
the car.  If you that live in the Atlanta, GA area contact me directly 
if you want to avoid one of these "businessmen".

Back to the subject at hand, I need manuals (and a lift for the garage 
would be nice).  I replaced the dash myself, pretty easy really but I 
need a road map for some of the mechanical stuff (especially the 
diagnostics).  Having been an avid engine builder as a kid, I find 
that the 944T is just a bit different than a Camaro or Corvette (like 
night and day).

I recently had the dealer adjust the car so that it would pass 
emissions here in GA and now I don't get more than 1.1 BAR on the gage 
(.1 true I guess).  Looked for loose vacuum lines and leaks per this 
list but none found.  Didn't check the computer but I don't think that 
anyone has been messing around down there.  I called the dealer and 
they said it must be a coincidence as they just "leaned it out a 
little"???  Well I have an appointment in the AM...its just $$$$.

I have all sorts of great projects planned, the car needs a clutch and 
a few performance mods while maintaining as much OEM stuff as 
possible.  I am thinking a cat pipe and cup car disk short term and 
maybe later a wide fire ring gasket and a blueprint job on the head 
and intake.  Lots of good info on this list!  Looking forward to the 
support!

P.S. forgive the ignorance but what is the silver blue color 
called???

Thanks in advance
