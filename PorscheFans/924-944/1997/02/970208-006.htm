Subject: belt slap


"This question is for a friend who lives in the boonies of eastern Oregon.
He has an '84 944 with 150,00 miles that recently got new belts. The job
was done by a mechanic who has worked with 911s, and some water-coolers
and the belts are from Vertex. All belts and rollers were changed, and
everything was found in good shape -- no unusual belt wear, no leaky
w/pump, no oil on shafts etc.

From the day after the new belts were mounted the cam belt started
slapping against the plastic cover. Tension was found to be correct, but
the belt still jumps around at the longest unsupported strecth between
rollers and hits the cover about a coupla times a second. The slap stops
after the engine is warm so the movement is very slight, but tensioning it
a little more than normal still does nto get rid of the initial slapping.

According to the mechanic he has never seen a belt jump around like this
cam belt, and the tension is not the problem. He thinks the belt is
structurally defective, with perhaps a hairs difference in width at 2
points which makes it jumpy. He says to get a new belt, but does not think
the few minutes of slapping will do any damage to the car in the interim.

Has anybody heard of this problem? My friend uses his car as a daily
driver -- should he stop and wait for a replacement belt? What does he do
about the $200 he has paid to have the belt mounted, Vertex only offers to
replace the belt, and the mechanic says he will charge the full labor
again since it was a customer provided part? Can the slapping be ignored
for a little while (slaps only at idle, till engine reaches normal temps).
Yes I know a bad belt can cause $$s of damage, and this is cheap
insurance etc. but this is the guy's only car and the tension on this
belt is visibly normal on the super-gauge, and has been checked less than
2 days ago. And he is talking about driving it only another 300 miles or
so (the nearest dealer!),and gingerly. Balance shaft belt is completely
normal. TIA.

'84 944"

I have experienced the same problem which was solved by a re-tension of the belt along with a 
careful install of the plastic cover.  The belt is slighter tighter than spec, but the annoying 
noise is over and after 5000 miles it seems to be properly solved
