Engines and Culinary Delights

Why should you clean the engine compartment?  Rust prevention, early
oil/fluid leak detection, early belt wear detection and cosmetics are amo=
ng
the prime reasons.  (There is a rumor that certain series of Porsches hav=
e a
factory designed engine oil leakage feature to assist in rust prevention =
for
the non-galvanized rear quarter panels and trunk areas.)

To soften the grease and grunge collected on your engine compartment, sta=
rt
the engine, let it warm up for a few minutes and shut it off.  The proper
cleaning temperature of the engine is warm but not hot.  If you can just =
hold
your hand to the engine without burning it, then it is warm enough to cle=
an.
 As the engine cools to proper temperature, use the time to cover the few
openings on a Porsche motor that dislike ingesting water.  The air intake=
/air
filter, the distributor, the coil and the oil dipstick/breather are among=
 the
few sensitive areas.  Porsche builds an engine that is so water proof tha=
t it
would probably run under water.

Use plastic baggies and rubber bands to cover the air intake/air filter(s=
)
and the distributor/coil. Place a double layer of baggies over the air in=
take
and secure with a couple of rubber bands.  Use a pair of two gallon size
baggies to cover the distributor and plug wires around the distributor ca=
p.
 This may be difficult to seal, but the idea is to prevent significant
amounts of water possibly shorting out the distributor.  If the cap is in
good condition, it will be =93waterproof=94, so this is only a preventati=
ve
measure.  The coil is also =93waterproof=94, so baggies are again a preve=
ntative
measure.  Check the tightness of the oil filler cap, the power steering
filler cap, windshield washer fluid cap, oil dip stick, battery filler ca=
ps
and all other engine compartment opening caps and secure baggies over the=
m
with rubber bands.  One area on 1983 to 1988 944=92s that is often overlo=
oked,
is the timing belt inspection opening on the cam gear drive cover (the si=
lver
metal base beneath the distributor cap).  There is a 3/8=94 inspection ho=
le at
the one o=92clock position.  There should be a rubber plug in this hole. =
 About
40% of all 944=92s I have inspected are missing this plug.  If yours is
missing, place a couple of baggies over the cam gear cover and secure wit=
h
rubber bands .  (You could also plug it with your finger, but this will
somewhat limit your reach.)  The best bet is to order a new one
(924S/944/944T - #944-105-131-00, 87-88 944S #944-105-131-01) and pop it =
in.

Now that your engine is warm and sealed, spray the entire engine/engine
compartment with a quality non petroleum based degreaser.  Try to start f=
rom
the bottom and work up.  This way, you don=92t have the degreaser droppin=
g on
you as you clean the underside areas.  My two favorite engine cleaners ar=
e
P21S Total Auto Wash and Wurth Citrus Degreaser.  I find that either of t=
hese
two products will clean thoroughly, and not harm the paint or finish of t=
he
aluminum components.  One note of caution, all degreasers will remove you=
r
nice coat of wax.  If you get overspray on the waxed areas, plan on rewax=
ing.
 Allow the degreaser about 3-5 minutes to work and then use a 100% cotton
towel or a =93SOFT=94 brush to =93GENTLY=94 brush the heavily soiled area=
s.  Respray
and rebrush any areas that need additional cleaning.  Once the entire
engine/engine compartment has been cleaned, rinse thoroughly with water.
 There is a debate as to the optimum force of spray to rinse the degrease=
r.
 Some say a gentle spray is all that is necessary, while others advocate =
the
use of a high pressure spray.  Use your common sense, the stronger the sp=
ray,
the more likely you will get water in sensitive parts.  If all areas are
properly protected, you should have no problems with a stronger spray.  I=
f
any areas need additional cleaning, repeat as necessary.

Once the engine/engine compartment is clean, immediately remove all of yo=
ur
plastic baggies/rubber bands.  Dry any =93puddles=94 and aluminum parts w=
ith a
soft 100% cotton towel.  Use paper towels to thoroughly dry the battery (=
if
it is in the engine compartment).  Start the engine and allow it to warm =
up.
 This will dry the rest of the engine and evaporate any moisture that may
have collected in sensitive components. =20

Once everything is dry and has completely cooled, you may wish to apply a
coating of rubber protectant to the rubber hoses, rubber wires, plastic
shields and rubber gaskets .  Meguiar #42 Rubber Treatment, Meguiar #40
Vinyl/Rubber Treatment, Sonax Rubber Maintenance Spray or Wurth Rubber Ca=
re
Spray all work extremely well.  I do not recommend treating the underside=
 of
the rubber belts, as this makes them reluctant to turn their respective
pulleys, with somewhat interesting results.  (This is somewhat like waxin=
g
brake pads)

The painted areas of your engine compartment should be waxed.  If there a=
re
any areas that are difficult to reach, Sonax makes a spray wax that requi=
res
little buffing and offers excellent protection.  Spray a light coat on th=
ese
areas and buff as much as possible.  Two thin coats are much better than =
one
heavy coat.

If the aluminum areas are dull or have whitish corrosion, a mild metal po=
lish
will help restore the finish.  Two of my favorites are Wurth 21S Metal Fi=
nish
Restorer Polish and Blue Magic Metal Polish.  Use a soft 100% cotton towe=
l
and work a small amount into the surface and buff out with another cotton
towel.

Check the battery terminals, to insure that they are clean.  If not,
disconnect the cables and clean both the cable terminals and battery post=
s
with a wire brush.  Reconnect the terminals and retighten.  Wurth makes a
nifty  Battery Terminal Spray that protects the terminals from corrosion =
and
changes from yellow to pink if there is battery acid leakage.

All of the hinges, throttle cables, cruise control cables and hood shocks
should receive a thin coating of non-silicone lubricant such as Wurth
HHS-2000 Spray Lube.  Lastly, check all fluid levels, remove any stray
baggies and you are finished!

Now that your engine compartment is squeaky clean, it may be time to prep=
are
some culinary delights.  Some of my favorites from the =93Official Road K=
ill
Cookbook=94 include windshield wabbit, grilled grouse, manifold muskrat a=
nd
last but not least, phender pheasant roasted to perfection on the interco=
oler
of 930 a Turbo.
