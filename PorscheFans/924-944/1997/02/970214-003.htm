Another possible answer to the cycling hatch latch:
I found this out after buying another motor(!) - There are two power supplies to the hatch latch, the switch sends power when depressed AND there is another supply that is always energized so that the motor can complete its rotation and stop in the correct place after the switch has been released. The second power is supplied through the same fuse as your sunroof - double check that first!! If that is good I would check the leads for power going into your motor for switched and continuous power before coughing up for a new motor. If you need any further advice Email me or call if you wish - sometimes these things are easier to sort out with real human contact (315-636-8716 ) I it really is the hatch motor I have a nice shiny one that you can have for a reasonable price. (My problem turned out to be wiring)
Once again - GREAT LIST, keep up the good work and many thanks.
For those east coast racing buffs - This will be the last year for Bridgehampton - you have to try this track before it's turned into a golf course next year. There are no others like it, Really BIG, FAST thrills!!!
