I keep seeing posts comparing the Mazda RX-7 to water cooled Porsches. 
Well I have a comparison for you.  I needed parts for my "Poor-man's"
Porsche ('77 924).  I went down to the local junk yard to find some trim,
interior pieces and a washer pump.  I couldn't get everything I needed
because there were very few 924's.  I found a total of 5 P-cars, 3 914's
and 2 924's.  What I did see was lots of RX-7's.  When stacked in a pile
there bumper looks similar to a 924 so I noticed them while looking around.
 What really caught my attention was that very few were wrecked.  That
meant that they must have died mechanically.  That says something for
reliability and engineering.  Sorry guys, I'll stick with my 924!
