I buy them from Racer Wholesale. Cost about $82.00 per axle (I bought the
blue pads, which are the race pads: the black pads are a little cheaper)

The boost pressure guage does show a loss of boost, but as you know, in that
area of the guage, it's tough to read, so I didn't know how much was lost.
That's why I bought the VDO guage. With that guage, it's very clear how much
boost I am actually getting, and it clearly shows the boost decaying from a
max of 12psi to about 9psi. The test my mechanic performed by removing the
vacuum line that leads into the diaphram area of the wastegate, bypasses the
computer, and all possible influence on boost by any leaks in the vacuum
system. All of those things control when the wastegate opens. If you bypass
them, there is no control on the opening of the wastegate, and you should
get an overboost condition, since all of the exhaust gas is passing through
the closed wastegate and into the turbo (it goes without saying that you
have to be careful to keep from popping the head gasket). In my car, the max
boost was still only 12 psi. (My stock guage reads about 1.7 max, which is
down from about 1.9 to 2.0 previously).

Sorry to be so long-winded!

Mike
