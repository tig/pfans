	Welcome to the club. I'm told that this is a more prevalent
	problem among 928s. The consensus that I've gathered is that
	it's not an urgent problem so long as it goes away quickly.
	Obviously, if it's constantly ticking, you need to do something
	asap. Mine ticks very occaisionally and only on the coldest
	mornings for maybe 1-2 seconds.

	Sounds like an idle stabilizer to me. Have they checked that?

	Go to www.tirerack.com. I'd look at the Dunlop D40M2, the Dunlop
	SP8000, the Yokohama's, and the BF Goodrich R1's if you're really
	serious :)

-- [ From: Jim Bergman, PorscheFans Listmaster * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Hello everyone,

The PorscheFans list has recently been experiencing a problem where the
ability to receive new mail (SMTP) shuts itself down.  I'm working on the
problem with NTMail tech support, but we haven't found a solution yet.  I
apologize for the repeated messages this is causing.  It's driving us all
crazy (no pun intended).

It varys from a few hours to three days how long it runs normally, then
starts to act up.  The response I've received from NTMail technical support
has NOT been very helpful or timely.  I just installed a beta version of the
SMTP server -- we'll see if that helps.

Just wanted to keep you up to date on the problem.  Thank you for all your
helpful suggestions and your patience.

   - Jim Bergman
     PorscheFans Listmaster
