Hi,

My 944 has a variant of the driveline noise I've seen some of
you guys posting about. You can hear this noise when the car is
at idle and a little when you're just taking off in 1st gear.
The noise goes away as soon as the clutch is depressed. It
sounds like a rattle more than anything else. The clutch was
replaced when I bought the car (about 10k miles ago) and I was
told they changed "all the bearings in there." It is a somewhat
lightweight clutch (but still rubber-centered) and I had a
lightened flywheel installed at the same time. They also put a
low-mileage 944S tranny in as part of the pre-sale agreement.
There is also a whining noise in the driveline when I decelerate
(coast) with the car in gear. All these noises seem to eminate
from the front of the torque tube rather than the rear, so I
tend to not suspect the transmission. Can the lightened stuff
cause any of these problems? I *guess* I believe the mechanic
on the whole bearing issue. They only do Porsches. I really
don't want to sit at stoplights during the summer (when
everybody's got their windows down) with the damn clutch pedal
jammed to the floor the whole time.

I also exhibit the same trouble as some of you guys getting
into 2nd gear. This really irritates me! I also feel a little
grab sometimes going into 3rd. This problem mostly goes away
after 5-10 miles of driving, and is almost tolerable in the
summer. I'm going to try Swepco 201 just to see. I hope it's
not just my shifting technique. Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you
I have a Weltmeister short-shift kit. I hope that's O.K., I'd
hate to have to remove it.

Are the gears longer in the 944S tranny? I'm wondering how
this could affect my low end. Like all of us, probably, I think
I should be quicker off the line. I know my top end is O.K.
'cause I hit 140 mph on the speedo (on a closed track, officer)
and I don't think the factory even claims to go that high.
It felt like it would keep going, but I got scared (I know,
I'm a wuss).

What are your thoughts on these problems, and what are some of
your top speeds? I realize the speedo isn't too accurate but
this isn't rocket science. Or is it?

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
