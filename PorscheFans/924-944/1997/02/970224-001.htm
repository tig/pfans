<< What's the deal with the law on not being able to change the steering
 wheel to a Momo or something of the likes if you have an airbag?
 
 thanks! >>

You cannot tamper with any vehicle that has an airbag, period.  The
Manufacturers would like for us to have the right to do it, but not at the
risk of the potential lawsuits from dead and injured people that would blame
manufacturers for letting them remove or disable an airbag.  They are waiting
for the feds to pass legislation so that people would have that right, in
effect taking the responsibility away from the manufacturers and putting it
on the government.   I'm not sure we'll ever see it, because in the grand
total of things, airbags definately save more lives than they take.  I just
think you'll start to see smarter airbags.  I consider myself lucky to have
an '88 pre-bag Porsche.
