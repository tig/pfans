Hi All,

Last night, while driving in the rain, I was accelerating in
second gear when it felt like the engine was missing terribly.
I coasted to the next stoplight and the car was idling very
roughly.  I held the throttle at 2000 rpm and everything smoothed
out.  Then as soon as I tried to accelerate from the light,
the problem reoccurred around 3800 rpm.  It seemed like the
higher gear I was in, the lower the rpm at which the car had
problems.  At the next light I tried shutting off the motor
and restarting it, but to no avail.  Anyway, I was near my 
home and decided to park the car until morning. 

This morning, it was still raining out, but the car runs fine.
Very strange.  It felt like I had an ignition problem, but
I checked under the hood last night for any signs of arcing.
Also, in neutral the car didn't have problems revving--it had
to be under load.  I seem to remember someone mentioning 
something similar no too long ago, but I forget if they
were able to determine what caused the strange behavior.
Seems to me like something just got wet.
