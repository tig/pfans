So there we have it, we can now say unanimously that oil additives are
BAD for your P-Car.

One note, I do not understand what the big debate or discussion is on oil
changes and oil change intervals, seeing that the price of regular blend
20W-50 is so minor and even synthetic is very reasonable, and the price of
a new engine say is so very, very expensive, what exactly is the advantage
of going a long time between oil change intervals.

My '44 has 98,000 miles on the clock, it unfortunately sees the open road
about 6 months of the year, May to Oct. When I take it out of the garage
in the spring, I start it up with a light weight oil IE 10W30, I run it
for roughly 20 minutes around my neighborhood and than drain and replace
with 20W-50.

It sees a fairly intense summer, just ask the RCMP officer who caught me
with the cruise on 190KPH. I put about 4-5000miles on it in the summer and
have no problem doing 3 or 4 oilchanges.

I do not think that ensuring that your "baby" is full of clean oil, is
excessive, I like to think of it as piece of mind.

PS If it makes any of the environmentalist list members happy,I never
change the oil in my 83 Honda Civic wagon with 300,250KM's on the clock,
so I really don't consume more oil than anyone else. Just doing my bit for
Mother Earth.
