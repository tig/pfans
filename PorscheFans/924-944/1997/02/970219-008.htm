Hi All,

The problem with the intermittant heater control - except setting 4 is as 
followes: There is a assembly with 4 resistors located in the intake air stream 
which is used to control the speed of the fan. This assembly has 2 
Thermostatically controlled switches which cut out if to much current is drawn. 
These thermostats go bad with time - the contacts oxidize ( sp?). This assembly 
is expensive when new so you may want to try to clean them yourself.

About 8 months ago I was in the market for a new track car. I just got rid of my 
Nissan 300ZXTT - I blew 1 engine and 2 tranny's and broke other stuff with 32k 
miles. I had a '91 MR2 Turbo before that which was not drivable on the track - 
really bad rear suspension design and I also had my exhaust manifold replaced 
due to cracking and other problems. Other friends of mine had 3rd generation 
RX7's - Trannys are weak, apex seals go with horsepower boosts and other 
problems. What I found was that the 'fast' Japanese cars were in general 
underdesigned. They were fragile. The 944TS is not as fast off the line as any 
of these cars, but in the hands of a good driver is very competative with all of 
them. It is also made to go fast and stop fast and to be put on the track!

I looked for ~3 months for my car. I started with my local Porsche club, the 
local newspapers and Porsche brokers I knew - I didn't find any cars. I had to 
resort to Pano. Excellence, and Hemmings Motor News to find cars, and they were 
top dollar. I ended up with a car (1988 944TS) with 32k miles, all documentation 
in nearly concourse condition. It cost me $21k. It was the 4th one I had checked 
- the rest were largely junk - I found some in the $15k range but they needed at 
least $5k in repairs to be considered in good shape. So there is a range of 
price and there are the occasional deal - but you really have to be in the right 
place at the right time - with the cash to get them. 

Does anyboy have any recomendations for suspension settings for the 944TS with 
Comp T/A R1's - ride hight front, rear, caster, camber, toe...


Thanks

Ray Bahr
