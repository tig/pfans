	Kevin,

	What other work does your car need? How's the clutch? Are
	you coming up on a water pump/belt replacement interval?
	How many miles does it have on the clock? If the car is in
	otherwise good shape and you don't have any expensive 
	maintenance coming due, then I'd go ahead and fix it up.
	If it needs some other expensive things done, you might consider
	selling. Figure about $6000 to get a well cared for 84 with
	books and records, no problems, and good paint and interior.
