I have a 85.5 944 and would like to fix an annoying leak which seems to be coming
from the oil pan gasket. Right now the car is on jackstand and the steering rack,
sway bars etc.. are out for rebuild and it seems that it would be the perfect
timing to check on the oil pan gasket.

I'm sure there is a couple of guys/gals on the list who did the job on their
garage floor? I would like to hear from you and see if there is any pitfalls
before attacking the cross-member bolts.

It looks like only the cross-member needs to be removed to gain access. Any
clearance problem on the bell housing? Looks like it will clear but I prefer hear
story before than after I removed all the bolts.
How did you support the engine making sure you're safe under the car ..... the
bell housing seems the only place possible unless you use an engine support from
above.
Right now I have about 12-15 inches of clearance. Sure I'll prefer to be standing 
:-) but it is enough to perform the task adequately?

Please share your experience ... either good or bad. 
You can reply to vezina@cae.ca and pvezina@ican.net so I'll be able to grab your
comments from work and from home.

TIA
