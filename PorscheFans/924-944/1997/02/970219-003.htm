89 944 Turbo for sale
Arctic Blue w/Blue Leather
104K miles.
2nd Owner.  I purchased at 88K, 18 months ago
     1st owner did the Long Island Expressway commute with it for
several months before he sold it.  Okay, so I'm not from NYC or LI.
Belt and gear change -- 96K
16" BFG VR-4 -- 93K

After a recent trip to the mechanic, several mechanical problems were
identified:
     Power steering return line -- R/R
     Water Recirculation pump (not Water pump) -- gurgles -- R/R
    Heater/AC Controller (I'm not convinced the continuous heat problem
isn't something else.  I've replaced the heat control valve.)
     Left Front Control Arm -- balljoint (Some squeaking at summer temps)
    Throw out bearing is going (Chatter when clutch pedal depressed, but
not when in neutral with clutch pedal released.  I have replaced both
clutch master and slave cylinders.)
     Airbag -- 8 year check requirement

I could go on, but I don't want to scare too many interested parties away.
 I drive the car every day to work and it has been very dependable --
except in -20F temps!  There are a few more problems, but they are
minor by comparison.  Nothing the mechanically inclined (independently
wealthy :)  ), or very patient could not repair ...

The price is a firm $10,500.

So, if you are interested, drop me a note -- at this address or at
MACSnD@aol.com.
