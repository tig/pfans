This will be a familair post for some of you and not for others. Here's
the update for those that are following this story; I've have a cooling
problem with my 944 since last April. The list and I and my shop spent all
last summer trying to figure out what it is to no avail. I finally sort of
gave up last fall but it still irks me so I'm going try again and see if
any of the new people (hi Dave!) can figure it out. Sadly, I'm dubious.
This "problem" has outwitted the likes of my shop, Bruce Anderson, Greg
Brown, Kevin Gross, Barry Lenoble, the Buddha, etc. Well, I'll get on with
it...

	My car runs "warm". Let me elaborate. For the first 10 months
	I owned the car, you could set your watch by the temperature
	gauge. It almost never rose above the first mark (only on the
	hottest days) and never, ever rose above the middle between the
	two marks. The only time both fans were on was when the a/c was
	on. Last April, it suddenly got "quirky". The temp. guage rose
	to the middle and would sometimes rise as high as the second
	mark causing fan #2 to kick. This would keep the temp. from going
	any higher but would not cause the temp. to drop any. It stayed
	steady at the second mark. As spring wore on into summer, it
	kept getting worse as the temp. outside got hotter finally 
	stopping at a bit above the second mark just short of overheating.
	It was never in the red so it never actually overheated. Again,
	with both fans on, the temp. wouldn't come down. Turning on the
	heater (in Dallas in July and August) did help some. With the
	onset of fall and winter, the temp. gauge has dropped but still
	remains "quirky". Temps. are running too high; from just above the
	first mark on some days to just below the second mark on others.
	One of the strangest things I've seen is the temp. gauge at the
	second mark with both fans running and the outside temp. at 17
	degrees farenheit. Definetly something wrong there. It also varies
	by day. Some days, it's down at the first mark, others it's high.
	There appears to be no rhyme or reason to it. You get the picture.

	Here's what I've done to solve it. When it first happened, I
	thought, "No big deal, I was gonna add the lower temp. thermostat
	and thermofan switch anyway." So I dropped it at the shop, told
	them about the "warmness" and instructed them to switch out those
	two items. This they did. It caused the problem to get worse. At
	that point, the long, sad diagnostics begin. We put the old 
	thermostat and fan switch back in and it returned to the condition
	of "warmness" it was in before the switch. Then we begin to look
	at other things. We replaced the radiator cap. Flushed the coolant
	and replaced, checking for good flow and no junk in the coolant.
	It was fine. Water pump seemed fine. Oil cooler seals seemed fine.
	Next thought was the head gasket. We performed 4 leakdown tests 
	under varying conditions (hot, warm, cold, etc.) and each time
	got less then 2% on all cyclinders (this is a 100K mile car,
	awesome, huh:)? Also, each time any changes were made to the
	cooling system, the car was bled properly. So, after this we were
	stumped. At this point, I first asked the list for advice. One
	thing that was suggested that I hadn't thought of was a bad hose
	that looked good on the outside but had come apart on the inside
	and was stopping up the flow of coolant. We checked the hoses
	(took them off and checked them, I mean) and they're fine. Another
	suggestion was that we check the fuel mixture too make sure the
	car wasn't running lean thus cuasing an increase in temperature.
	The fuel mixture checked out just fine, too. I didn't want to
	spend more money without knowing if it would help so I 
	contiued to drive it hoping the problem would show up for real
	somewhere. In August, the oil cooler seals began to leak so I
	replaced them. New oil cooler seals didn't help. A couple weeks
	after that, I decided to go ahead and replace the water pump
	since it was about that time and I was hoping this had something
	to do with it. The new water pump went in but there was no change.
	Around October, the car happened to be in the shop for an
	unrelated matter and they called me to tell me that they had
	a brand new 944 radiator in the shop and they'd like to switch
	it out with mine to see if my radiator was getting old and just
	wasn't doing its job anymore. I agreed, but unfortunetly, this
	didn't help, either. Here's where it gets weird though, when
	they put my old radiator back in, they replaced my thermostat
	with a new one and the problem got worse. Then they put my old
	t-stat back in and the problem was cured!...for about 10 days,
	then it went back to its same old trick of running to warm which
	it's done all winter. This brings us up to present day. So, here's
	what we've done/checked:

	Coolant system checked for proper pressure and bled multiple
	times
	water pump replaced
	radiator cap replaced twice
	oil cooler seals replaced
	radiator checked, cleaned, and swapped with a new one to no
	effect
	t-stat replaced a total of 3 times
	thermofan switch and fans checked---operating ok
	hoses checked
	water pump belt checked
	head and head gasket integrity checked---ok here
	no loss of coolant anywhere at anytime
	fuel mixture checked---ok here


	So, anyone want to take a stab at it?
