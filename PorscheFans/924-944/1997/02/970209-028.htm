This sounds like the limit switches on the sunroof are out of adjustment.
I wrote to some one else about this type of behavior:

Where in the world is the sunroof motor?

First, remember that the sunroof motor and limit switches are located in
the rear of the car.  To reveal that assembly, unsnap the carpet in the
rear of the car that the rear interior light is mounted in (driver's side
rear fender).  There are plastic rivets that secure the top edge of the
carpet.

Once removed, there is an assembly that is mounted to the side of the
inside fender with two nuts on the top edge and one bolt on the bottom (all
require a 10 mm wrench or socket).  Unfasten those nuts.  You should now be
able to lift that assembly out enough to work on it.  If you examine the
assembly, you will notice it has a motor, which has a cable that snakes up
into the roof, and a wiring harness that plugs into a socket.  Also, there
are two relays (brownish cubes at the bottom) and nearer the top are two
micro switches that are mounted side by side on part of the assembly plate
that is bent at a 90 degree angle.  On the back side of the assembly is a
white pie shaped plastic cam that will engage and disengage those two
switches.

First check that the two switches are not loose.  That is what happened to
mine.  If they are loose, you need to snug them up, but the position of the
switches is finicky.  I adjusted mine by trial and error (it is a bear).
Eventually you will get it working.  Be patient and take your time.  If
those switches are tight, then one of the switches may be bad, FIRST check
with a Digital Multi Meter to make sure.  Before you dive into making
adjustments, check everything out first. Be careful about making blind
adjustments.  You may just make more work for yourself.

If both switches seem to be good, I would try swapping the two relays to
see if the roof behaves differently (I think they are identical relays and
can be switched).  Do not overlook the wire harness connector, it could be
dirty, or the female lugs may have lost their clamping force.

Some observed theory of operation:

During operation, the plastic pie shaped cam should move to the rear
(clockwise, when looking at the backside of the assembly) whenever the roof
is raised, and to the front (anticlockwise) of the car when the roof is to
be removed.  In my car, when the roof is down and restrained, the inside
micro switch (closer to the pivot point of the cam) should be pushed into
the ON position (fully engaged).  The outer micro switch should be in the
open (OFF) position.  That outer switch will close whenever the roof
restrainers are retracted (during roof removal) as the cam rotates
anticlockwise.

If you remember, there are actually three micro switches associated with
the sunroof.  The third switch is located in the front center of the
sunroof opening of the car.  It is disguised as a black doo hicky
(trapezoid plastic activation plate for the technically minded) that will
be engaged by the tung of the sunroof whenever it is on the car (up or
down, it does not matter).  When the roof is removed, that switch will turn
off and keep the console switch from activating the sunroof motor in the
absence of a roof.  The switch can be removed by extracting the Phillips
screws that hold it in, and gently pulling the switch assembly out.  To
disconnect the wires, you must carefully peel the vinyl away from the top
of the interior roof to get at the connection point.  For what ever reason,
Porsche does not have enough wiring harness length to pull that connector
out without peeling the vinyl back first.

There is a safety feature built in this car, such that the sunroof
restraining arms will be engaged by the sunroof motor if the car is moved
forward or backward (that is, if the sunroof is in place, but not yet
secured by the rear restraining arms).  This was done to avoid accidental
ejection of the sunroof should you drive away without securing it first.

Final notes:

Most of the sunroof can be fixed by the shade tree mechanic, but it takes
patience to get it right.  Particularly if you have to adjust those limit
switches.
