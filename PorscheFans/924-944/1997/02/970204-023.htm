I can't speak for the guys with 24's or 51's...but as far as the 44's
go...When I picked up my 86' -944 a few weeks back, I brought it to a Porshe
specialist to do a bumper to bumper check up. Even though the car has only
30K, it is ten years old, so I asked them to simply replace all of the hoses
and belts. Evidently, the hoses had already been recently replaced, so I let
them go.  Well, all replaced except one...And this is the reason for this
message.  At the top of the back of the engine is a port where the coolant
flows through a small elbow shaped piece of hose, maybe 3 inches long. It
goes to a regulator which has another hose which comes out of the bottom,
which I would imagine goes to the heater core. Last Sunday, while out tooling
around enjoying the sunshine and seasonably warm weather, that little elbow
piece blew out...spewing coolant all over my clean motor and front end.  (not
to mention, screwing my day completely...) Luckily, I was able to grab a cab
to a nearby R & S Strauss, get a piece of hose, go back, pop it in and be on
my way. My point...DON'T overlook that friggin'  piece of hose...(or carry a
little spare with you...)
