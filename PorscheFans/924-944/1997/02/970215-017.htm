Hi all !

I have read several test-reports saying that my 2.5L 163 HP 924S
theoretically should be a little faster than a similar 944, because the
924S is a little more airodynamic and a little lighter... I never had a
chance to verify that though.

Until this night, that is !  :)

I was driving home from a party and suddenly saw a 944... I turned around
quickly and raced towards it. I do this very often when I see a Porsche
(and I garantee you, I see them all !), but most of the time they are not
in the mood to drive fast or it's simply too crowded. But this one thought:
"Ha ! 924 ! Let's show my passenger how fast my car is !". I could easily
keep up with him of course. Then on a straight piece of highway we were
both doing something like 235 kph (first time I did this in Holland... had
only done that 2 times before in Germany)... It was really obvious that I
was driving a tiny little bit faster... something like 2 kph... :) It was
really cool looking at his face as I was overtaking him ! :)

Later we turned down our windows and he yelled: "That's not the way it's
supposed to be, why is that thing going so fast ???". Obviously he had
never heard of an S ! :)

I must say that I was alone in my car, the 944 had 2 people (a little more
weight). I had my antenna down, I don't know about his. 

On the other hand, I have airco, powersteering, Targa-roof, electrical
windows and some more accessories adding some weight to my car... I don't
know what he had...

Anyway, the claim that a 924S (mind you, the 163 HP version !!) is faster
than a similar 944 is really true !!

would mean my drivers' license !)
