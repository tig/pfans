Tom ,

I too have a Honda which happens to be my winter beater, with over 300,000
Km's on the clock it still runs like a charm, well not really!

If I was to maintain it as meticulously as my P-Car it would cost me a
fortune.

Lets see, the engine wouldn't be pissing oil
The fenders wouldn't be kicked in
And most inportantly it would be rust free!

Now I get a real laugh every time I see an Acura or Honda or even a
Volkswagen, with a mile wide crome exhaust and more vinyl stickers than (
Im not really sure what!) the point is these are not race or sports cars,
they are wannabe Porsches (Citing this months Excellence). They are
fantastic compact cars but once you begin to drive them hard track or
otherwise they do not stand up.

This is where the Volkswagen leaves the Japanese cars behind.

My point and it may be biased is that there is European engineering and
then there is the rest!

Anthony Kalcounis
