In the early 944s there is no "first" position. When you insert the key the 
antenna goes up, door warning chimes start, the sunroof is supposed to latch 
and unlatch etc. The "on" position is when warning lights self-test, fuel pump 
operates, fresh-air blower starts, and the sunroof is supposed to operate 
normally without unlatching. I am guessing that in the later 944 you actually 
have to turn the key to get to the first few functions.

Same problem as you two with my roof, except it is even more random. It 
latches and unlatches when it wants to, sometimes (mostly at sub-zero temps) 
it goes up and refuses to come down, and once at highway speeds it decided to 
unlatch with predictably dangerous consequences. I have not gotten around to 
checking the microswitch, so details of this procedure would be appreciated. A 
temporary fix to this problem is to get the roof to latch and then remove one 
of the 2 relays next to the roof motor behind the carpeting on the left side 
of the hatch, behind the hatch-light.
