Before you consider buying the front fender damaged 944, you should take it
to a body shop respected for Porsche repairs and have them put the car on a
frame machine.  This series of car often acquires the subtle shape of a
banana when hit on a quarter panel.  To repair the car correctly can be big
dollars, well exceeding your expected savings.  Checking out the car may cost
several hundred dollars due to the time and minor disassembly required.  

I just repaired a 968 with rear quarter panel damage for 13K, and another 968
was there with more severe rear quarter damage for 22K.  Although both cars
looked fine, except for the damaged panels, the frame machine showed both had
damage at the other end of the car as well.  Both these cars only had damage
to the quarter panel; glass and everything else was fine.  The cars needed to
be partially disassembled, and all mounting points realigned by the frame
machine.  I forget the name of the machine used, but do remember it is the
only machine approved by Porsche for frame repair.  In my case, the car was
alignable before the straightening occurred.  After it was straightened, I
had to replace the rear control arm as well to bring the car back into
alignment.  

The resulting cars are stunning, and I am sure you could get by with a lesser
repair bill.  But buying a car worth 6K for 2, and paying for the repair does
not sound like a good idea to me.

RUN FROM THAT CAR!!!!
