OK, my '79 924 had some plastic fall apart on the heater core (or around
there, anyway, I wasn't able to get details) so I need a new one.  The
local Porsche dealership wants $350, which is clearly highway robbery, so
I refuse to pay that.  My mechanic can get a new one for $110 (which is
much closer to what I expected), and a used one for $100.

The problem is that the $110 part is back-ordered, and I need my car back
yesterday.  I use it for a daily commute, and car-pooling is extremely
arduous when I don't have to be anywhere for over an hour after the person
I car-pool with does.  (Confusing sentence, but it isn't important.)  The
parts supplier has *no* date for when they'll get more heater cores, so
I'm thinking it'll be at least a month.  (Since my front side marker light
has been on order for over three months with no luck.  I bought one from
Performance Products, finally, since it looks ugly otherwise.)

I'd probably go for the used part, keep my order for the new one, and when
it came in replace the used heater core.  However, installing the heater
core apparently involves about five hours of labor, which means I wouldn't
even want to *consider* doing it myself.  This equates to almost $300 for
a part of questionable reliability, and about the same to get it replaced
when it goes (which I'm pretty sure it will do eventually).

OK, sorry about the long story.  I have two questions now.  First, is
there anywhere I can get a new heater core within a week or so for $150 or
less?  Second (an "if-not"), what heater cores will fit in a 924 without
causing problems down the line?  Although I hate to put VW parts in my
Porsche, I'll do it if it saves me $200.  My mechanic is checking this out
(hopefully) even as I write this, but anything to make the wait shorter
will be much appreciated.  Actually, he has a VW heater core at the shop,
so if it fits, it'd be really great.

If you want *more* detail for some reason, just ask.  I'll tell you what I
can.  And thanks in advance.
