Hello again,

The little hole in my exhaust has recently become a medium-sized hole.
This, combined with the fact that I just got my state income tax refund,
has prompted the following question... Should I just get a factory-type
replacement, or a performance exhaust? It's just a street car, although
I might auto-x it this spring/summer. It's only going to get noisier as
time goes on, and since I've got a little extra cash now... you know
how it goes.

What brands do you guys recommend (performance or stock)?, is a header
a net plus or minus?, what to do with the cat? Etc., etc. The idea of
replacing everything appeals to me because I've read that the stock
exhaust manifold is prone to hairline cracks and I've psyched myself
into believing that mine is cracked (if it might be broke, fix it!).
Any info would be appreciated, I really need your advice on this one.

I'm also looking into the MSDS or similar intake system. Did someone
say you need a different oxygen sensor for that? Please inform me if
you know anything about this.

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944
