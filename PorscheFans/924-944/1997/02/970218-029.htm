Eric, I have the same problem with my 87 951. 

These are the things my mechanic and I have done so far:

1.  Installed a VDO turbo boost guage. Reads in PSI and only costs about $26.00.
This verified that the boost was down to 12 psi max. and decayed rapidly to
10 psi. (My car is chipped and should get to about 14.7 psi).

2.  My mechanic disconnected the vacuum tube that runs into the wastegate.
This is the means by which the computer tells the wastegate to open. If the
problem is in the vacuum system, computer, etc. that controls the wastegate,
you should get full or over-boost when you disconnect this line. Mine still
read 12 psi max.

3.  As a result of the above, my problem is either a) wastegate blow-by
(maybe a burned valve); b) turbo problem; c) leak in plumbing leading into
or out of the intercooler; or d) catalytic converter.

The only one of these that is easy to check is the catalytic converter by
disconnecting it temporarily. If that doesn't work, I'll check the plumbing
coming out of the intercooler. After that, I'll probably have my mechanic go
underneath, remove and check the wastegate and the plumbing leading into the
intercooler.

BTW, if you haven't checked, the list price on a wastegate is over
$1,800.00, and Porsche doesn't sell parts for it, only the complete unit.

Good luck, and if you find out what it is, please let me know.

Mike
