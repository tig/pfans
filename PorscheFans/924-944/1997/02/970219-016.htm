Thanks everyone for your replies to my noise question. Most of you were
very nice in pointing out that these symptoms were discussed in the FAQ.
I think that's a testament to the quality of the people on this list.
Most lists of this type would have given me a bunch of "check the damn
FAQ before wasting my time" messages.

To those of you with the same problem as me (rattling noise at idle with
the clutch engaged; trouble getting into second, etc.), has Swepco gear
oil made any difference? I'm going to try it anyway, but I know some of
you guys out there have done this and I'm curious. Is anything better
than Swepco?

I also noticed that if you move the shift lever a little toward any in-
gear position you can affect the noise a little. You can actually get it
to stop if you put the lever in certain positions. Is this in line with
the rest of you guys? This would seem to correlate with the FAQ's
assertion that there is an idler gear rattling around on a shaft inside
the transmission. If this noise really is normal (and I'm becoming more
and more convinced that it is) that doesn't make it any less annoying.
Please let me know what you guys think!

Thanks alot,

ROG - '84 944
