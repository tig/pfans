     I have just received word that the cost of "Porsching" is likely to 
     see an increase.
     
     What I am speaking about is the  wonderful service that this list 
     provides all of us is about to cost us additional pocket money.  I use 
     my E-mail and Internet primarily for Porsche related items.
     
     The local telephone companies (ALL OF THEM) have petitioned the FCC to 
     charge a per minute fee to telephone users (That's us folks) for the 
     time we are connected to our Internet servers.
     
     February 13th is a deadline for "us folks" to give them a piece of our 
     minds by E-mailing them with your comments.
     
     I urge all of you to E-mail the FCC and keep our use of the Internet 
     and the free exchange of Porsche experience reasonable.
     
     Write to : isp@fcc.gov
     
     Thanks to all of you.  This list, and its members really means a lot 
     to me.
