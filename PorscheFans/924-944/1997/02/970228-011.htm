Hey guys,

Any info on Hawk brown street pads?  I got what seemed to be a screaming
deal on a set so I bought 'em, but have no information on them.  Any of
you guys use them?

How do they dust?  Really bad or not so bad?
Do they stop well?
How's the fade resistance?
Anything else, just let me know.

Do you guys find that with your Porsche, you are way too anal about things?
I spent four hours adjusting my hood over the last two days.  I seriously
think there is something wrong with me!  I still haven't got it perfect,
but it seems to be the best it'll line up.  Now, whenever I drive over
bumpy roads, I think the hood is going to fly off or something :)  I
should just leave the car alone and drive it, don't you think :) :)

Who is coming out to the March 9th autocross at Kent, WA?  Let me know so
we can decide on a meeting place and we can all go together.  It was cool
seeing all those 944 Turbos going down the road together last time and I'd
like to do it again, this time with even more of 'em.

And yes, the digest is having problems, so you have to manually view the
archives off the www.porschefans.com web site.

Farzaan.
