	There are no years to avoid, per se. If you buy a model
	that is 85.5 or later, you'll be getting increased hp, a better
	dash layout, and other improvements, however.

	Depends on how much you want to drive it. Let's say you
	want to put 10K a year on it. I'd budget $700 a year based	
	on that mileage with the understanding that I could pay
	a lot more if something went wrong with the clutch, water
	pump, etc.


> 4) Is the 944T more costly than the 944 to maintain.

	Yes.

> 5) What does the turbo do exactly besides make the car go faster.

	Lots of things. Better and bigger brakes, better suspension,
	bigger wheels and tires, beefier clutch, you get the idea.

	Not necessarily. Farzaan has an 89 951 and he's 21, I think.
	Tom Pultz's son has one (but that's a bit of a different story :)
	and he's 21, too. Just be prepared for the fact that you may end
	up eating a repair bill at some point (especially with the turbo)
	and you'll be ok. Enjoy!

	5-8K is not gonna buy you a good condition turbo. However, it
	will buy you a good condition 86 or 87 944. Good luck.
