I just finished a year-long project, finally getting my 1979 924 into 
safe running condition.  Then I wandered upon this digest and thought 
that this would be the perfect place to get some questions answered. My 
924 has the usual problems (water in the taillights, leaky battery 
compartment, stuck odometer, etc.) and a daily review of the digest 
provides me with excellent solutions.  Unfortunately, there are a few 
questions I am only ignorant enough to ask, so here they are:

1> What is a 951?? I had read extensively on Porsche, and I have not 
found reference to the 951.  Could somone tell me where I could download 
a good photo?

2> My 924 does not have a space between the tail lights for a license 
plate, but instead it has a large red reflector bridging between the 
lights.  Kind of like the 911.  My question is, why does mine have this?

3> I have decided to change out the oil in my transmission (original 
5-speed) and the car calls for 80w 90 oil, but my local mechanic says to 
use 85w 140, since the transmission has 70,000+ miles on it. Any ideas?

Overall I am impressed by the enginerring in this car, but I would have 
gone broke getting parts if I had not found a 924 parts car to strip 
down.  I appreciate the help.

Travis Bowles,
1979 924 -- only two months older than its owner
