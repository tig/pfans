IMHO if you're driving the car on the street, leave the sizes as they are.  
The larger tires will have some potential downside.  They may be noisier, 
especially slapping over highway seams.  They will have more of a tendency to 
hydroplane in the wet.  You will use up a bit more hp to roll them and the 
additional width may cause tracking problems on certain roads where there is a 
worn in track. 
 
That said, if it's a track situation, the extra stick far outweighs the other 
issues in terms of lap times. 
 
Now, if it's a testosterone fix and a "mine is bigger than yours" situation, 
that you're after, you gotta get the bigger tires and all else is 
mousenuts......

I just read the post about reducing car weight at road speeds.  It seems
like a few pounds of added weight to the wheel and tires can really make a
difference when manipulated by those warp multiplication factors for
acceleration, etc.  I have recently bothered everyone about whether or not I
should widen my 205/225's to 225/245's, and all replies have encouraged me
to go ahead with the up-sizing.  Now I realize that a few mm more rubber
width (and the air added within) isn't much added weight.  But if you apply
those multiplication factors to those small figures, will the resulting
weight be enough to cancel any benefits I may receive by up-sizing the
tires?  Will acceleration suffer while cornering grip increases?
        I am probably just making a big thing out of nothing.  But I just
may have a change of heart if I learn that the added mass will make a
noticeable negative difference.  I was hoping I won't be sacrificing much by
going wider.  So what is it folks?  I know that more rubber = more grip =
Good.  But does more rubber = more (significant) weight = Bad?  Thanks in
advance for any help or replies telling me to stop worrying about a few
silly pounds.
