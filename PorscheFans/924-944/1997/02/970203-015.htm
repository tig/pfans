My '84 944 got stuck bad this Friday in a sea of mud that passes for state
route 12 here in Washington state. Rains over the past week or so have
done the roads a lot of damage, but for some reason the car responded fine
all the way till it got stuck. The more normal course of events is a lot
of fishtailing and a generally un-solid feeling that would warn me not to
go any further and get out and check the surface. 

In any case, the left drive wheel sunk into an inch or so of mud and
limited slip and snow tires or not my 944 decided to stay there for the
night. 16 miles of walking in the rain and mud and I got home. However by
the time I got a tow truck to the scene on Saturday the left side of the
car had sunk quite some, and the muffler and the left half of the
underbody was sitting in the mud. I have had this car towed onto a
flat-bed once before, but for the life of me I could not locate the hook
they had used for the winch that time. The tow-truck driver looked up his
manuals and said the A-arms were listed in his book as strong enough for a
tow, or at least to get it unstuck.

With the weather getting worse and the car sinking, I did not have a
choice and did get it winched out with a hook on the right A-arm. The
spoiler scrunched a little, but this tow-guy seemedt o be confident there
would be no structural damage. This morning I lifted the car up and had a
look. Besides a coating of mud the underbody seems to be fine. The A-arm
does have some little nicks, but I cannot tell if there is any damage.

Does anybody know if the A-arm would support the weight of the car for a
few seconds? And where is the hook that you use for flat-bed winches
anyway? What about damage to look for on the underbody -- the surface was
mud, but the car did drag across it so I am nto sure what to look for. 
Would mud get in anywhere (vents, inspection holes)?  Thanks.
