How many miles is it safe to go on a transaxle oil change? Last summer I 
had mine changed and the mechanic -- a 911 guy -- said something very 
strange. Apparently Porsche has published a technical paper warning 
against the use of GL-5 spec oil in a Porsche that says it needs 
GL-4/GL-5. Doesn't make any sense to me since GL-5 is supposed to 
incorporate and extend GL-4 specs. I have forgotten his explanation since 
-- anybody else heard of this? Is it possible that the early 944s have 
copper synchros, hence GL-4? What is the Porsche recommendation for 
transmission oil?
