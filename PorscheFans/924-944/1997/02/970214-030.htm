I've Recently become the proud owner of a mint red 86 944. With the
exception of some minor problems(most of which have already been solved by
this service)this is the most fun I've had in years. Today, however, I got
in my car and started off to work and realized that I had no heat. I've
been driving the car daily since I bought it two weeks ago and the heat has
been working fine. In fact you could lean down in front of the dash vents
and dry your hair with the heat cranked. The coolent level is fine and the
temperature gauge is reading within normal limits. I was hoping this
morning was a fluke but it was the same when I drove home from work
tonight. With the fan off the air coming out is sort of warm but as soon as
you turn on the fan it starts blowing cold air. Has anyone out there
experienced anything like this or have any idea what to do about this?
