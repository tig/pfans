Hey everybody (including the warring factions from the "Asian-Spam" 
incident),

I'm putting my 82 924T back together next weekend and was hoping 
someone has pulled one of these engines before.  I've got most of it 
figured out (except hooking up all those stupid wires), but any and 
all advice would be helpful, if there are any common problems to run 
in to.
Also, wanted to ask a couple Q's:
1)  Does anyone make a larger throttle body for later 924T's?
2)  Since I'm going to put an intercooler in, I wanted to be able to 
adjust the boost w/o taking that HUGE 930 wastegate out again.  I'm 
thinking if I put a hose to the top and tee it in to the lower line 
through some kind of adjustment knob, I should be able to adjust it 
safely.  Sound OK? 
3)  Want to put a knock sensor in the car (PO blew the pistons and 
rings twice w/ too much boost).  Any experience?
4)  Would like 14psi w/ 944 intercooler.  Any ideas for accurate fuel 
enrichment for CIS?

                               TIA!
                               Dave
