"Roger asked about rebuilt injectors"

The most important thing to consider is that your injectors are flow matched.
See if you can find a local injector shop that can do this.  If you buy rebuilt,
you may wind up with ones that were only ultrasonicly cleaned and have different
flow rates.  A set of new ones may not be will matched but will be better than
the rebuilt ones.  A shop that has the equipment and experience can check the
flow rate of each injector and put together sets with similar flow rates.  

Changing the injectors is one of the less objectionable tasks under the hood.
Pull yours out, take them to a injector shop and have them checked.  You may not
need new ones.  If yours are worn out, shoot the bucks and buy a new set of flow
matched injectors.
