The door locks operate by using the key in one of the doors. Both will lock 
or unlock using the key. They also can be operated from inside the car with 
the little switch in front of the shifter with the red light and a picture 
of a lock or by pressing one of the buttons. No idea on the wiring.

The later 944s use an antenna in the windshield and an amplifier. You need 
to power the amplifier when the radio is switched on. I did it using the 
power antenna wire coming out of the stereo. The wire you need to connect 
is one the same harness as the antenna connection itself. The factory 
manual has a picture of it.
