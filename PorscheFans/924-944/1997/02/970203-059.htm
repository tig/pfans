I've heard this as well, which is why I decided to go with the RaceWare
studs.
Considering the time investment to do this job, I figured the new studs
were
cheap insurance.

Well, my friends (cheap labor) and I got the head off in about SIX hours
on
Friday night.  As this was the first time for the three of us to try
this on
a Porsche, it didn't seem too bad.  I've been told by another friend
that
he can get his off in about three hours by himself.  The most difficult
part
for me was removing two of the bolts where the exhaust manifold
(headers?)
bolts to the pipe under the car--I ended up breaking one of the bolts,
but
figured they should all be replaced anyway.

As for the head studs, I got seven of them out this weekend before I ran
out of time.  The head was straight, but I'm having it milled 0.002
inches
anyway.  Also, I decided to replace the valve guides, seats, and seals
and have a three-angle cut done.  Of the three studs left, two I have
not
yet attempted, and the third is being very stubborn.  I decided to let
it
sit until next weekend rather than break it out of frustration.  I
suppose
we may have to heat the block up to get it out, but I'm not sure how to
go about it.  Maybe some sort of propane torch? Ouch!  Interestingly,
the
studs on the exhaust side of the motor were MUCH easier to remove. 
Perhaps
only 20 lb-ft of force was required to turn them.

Also, though the Porsche expert who is doing the valve work said that it
looked like cylinders three and four were definitely leaking, the head
gasket looked fine.  Makes me wonder if the head has been off before on
this car.  I got a HUGE stack of maintenance and repair records with the
car, but not a single one of them for replacing the head gasket.
