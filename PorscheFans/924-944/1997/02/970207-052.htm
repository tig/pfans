Hi everybody,

I'm almost afraid to post for fear of the entire universe being
filled with this message, choking off all the oxygen, and killing
everyone. Then you'll all be mad at me. Oh well...

I'm preparing to change my injectors (& pressure valve & damper)
and wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, would it be
advisable to use rebuilt injectors? They are alot cheaper (NOPI
has them for $26.00 each compared to 64.00 for new) but I'll
pay for new ones if "rebuilding" means "washing" or something.
What does rebuilding constitute with regards to injectors?

The other thing is this... am I in for any suprises when doing
this? It looks really straightforward. Everything's on top, in
easy reach. My car has cruise control, but it looks like I won't
have to remove the cable. The Haynes book makes it sound easy,
but this is the most involved thing I've considered doing so-far.
I don't want to get it all apart and find out I need Porsche tool
#944-blah-blah to finish. Any info would be greatly appreciated.
