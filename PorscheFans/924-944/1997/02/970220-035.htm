Question : What are the torque specs for the 10mm bolts that hold the rear
cover to the engine?  I can't seem to find this info anywhere in the manuals.


Woo hoo.  I finally received a new rear timing belt cover today.  After a few
shipping snafus, I've finally got it.  Of course if I'd known it was going to
take this long, I would have waited for Mr. George B to get back from florida.

Tip:

To install the cover into a turbo 944, install it from underneath the car.  It
won't go in from the top, even if you remove the upper radiator hose.  To get
it in from underneath, you can unbolt the oil cooler mounting bolts, and push
the cooler and it's hose enough out of the way to squeeze (and I'm talking
about squeezing baby) the cover into place on the engine.

I think I wept after I finally got the dang thing on the engine.

Later all.
