I have an 87 924S and I love the car.  I have had her for about 6 months and
for some time she was in the shop getting much needed work.  I am at college
and have not the time or facilities to do the work myself.  My qyestion is
this:  are 924S very sensitive to the cold?  I have only had it down here
with me in Blacksburg, Va.  for about a month and one the cold (about 20 to
30 degrees F) mornings she is hard to start.  The car idles rough and wants
to quit unless I keep the revs up, after a bit of driving the cars is fine.
Is this a 924S thing or is it just my car?  Thanks for the help.
