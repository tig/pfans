I few years ago I purchased a 1980 924. Ever since the first day, I have
been having starting problems with it. The problem is, 95% of the time the
car didn't start. It didn't matter what the temperature was, or how humid it
was, the car would turn over forever but would never start. The only way to
get it going was a shot of starting fluid into the air boot. The engine has
been rebuilt, I have installed new injectors, distributor, captive discharge
box, aux. air valve, ignition coil, wires, and a cold start injector. None
of these repairs corrected to problem. I have been reading PorscheFans for a
few months and I plan to replace the fuel pump and the accumulator next.
Thanks for the advice.

The car hasn't been started since October so I was going to start it up a
few weeks ago. I connected the battery and turned the key. The battery had
lost most of its charge and the car didn't start(I was shocked!). I popped
the hood and told my friend to hook up the battery to the charger for a
while. I was looking under the hood when I saw sparks starting to fly
around. I looked up and saw they were coming from the battery. My friend
looked at me a said, "I think I connected um backwards." At that point I
wasn't too concerned. I hooked up the charger the right way and we let the
battery charge for a few hours. I came back out and the car turned over like
it was supposed to but it didn't start. I sprayed sme starting fluid in it
and turned over the engine again. NOTHING! The fluid didn't even ignite. I
checked my connections and sprayed some more fluid. NOTHING. After a few
hours of trouble shooting and testing for fuel and spark we came to the
following discoveries:

As you know, there are 3 contacts on the ignition switch: OFF, ACCESSORIES,
START. As I understand it, when the key is at start 3 things are supposed to
happen: SPARK, FUEL, and the STARTER turns over the engine. When I turn the
key to start, the engine turns over, but there is no spark (I'm not sure
about fuel). The odd part is, if I turn the key real slow, just after I turn
past the ACCESSORIES contact, I get a big spark off of the coil and I hear
the fuel pump energize. But as soon as I make contact to the START
possition, there is nothing coming off of the coil. I had my friend hold the
end of the coil wire while it was engaging the starter. He said he didn't
feel a thing!

What should I do now? Could the backward battery charger have burned out
something in the electrical system? The fuses all looked good. What about
the relays? Could it be as simple as installing a new ignition switch? I
would appreciate any advice you have. Thanks.
