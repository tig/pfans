Hey guys,

I think the list has finally got rid of the repetitive monsters so I'll 
make my long post now.  First, I'll give you the status of my Water 
car.

The only things damaged were the undertrays and the mats and carpets were
soaked.  The mats actually did a very good job of keeping the carpets
reasonable dry.  I can't believe the amount of water the mats held in,
they felt like they weighed 20lbs each.  After spending two nights with
hair dryers going full tilt in the car, all the carpet and mats were dried.
The undertrays cost C$160 for one and C$180 for the second and install
was free.  Without the trays on, the car was running hotter and the car
felt uncomfortable over 80mph.  I don't think aerodynamics makes that much
of a difference at that speed so it might just be psychological.  The car
was much noisier without the undertrays on too.  So, as far as driving into
the puddle, everything seems to have returned to normal, the vibration was
the undertray pressed up against the exhaust and resonating.

While the car was at the shop, the service manager and I decided to do
some testing.  We slapped on an aftermarket boost gauge from Autometer
and went testing.  We had three chipsets to test.

1. Autothority (really old chips)
2. Autothority (version 2.7 latest)
3. Andial turbo cup computers (purchased from AJ-USA who purchased from
   Andial back in 1988)  Cost for these were US$1000!

I'll give you the impressions I got from each one:

1. The torque curve was flatter than stock without the on-off nature of
   the stock chips, but the power came in later than the other 2.7 chip,
   but also came in a bit harder.  Initial boost is set by the cycling
   valve in my car (modified unit that came with the turbo cup computers)
   so initial boost will always be 15psi.  This chip would then pull
   the boost up to about 16.5psi and then start to pull it down as revs
   went up to as low as 13psi.  In 1st gear, both Autothority chips would
   not make full boost under WOT, they both went up to only 12.5psi.
   Up the test road, this chipset reached 145km/h.

2. The newer 2.7 chipset felt much crisper and much more responsive than
   the older APE chips.  The decay cycle was too sharp as I've seen is
   common in aftermarket chips.  The decay cycle is the rate that fuel
   is cut when you get off the throttle.  APE uses the decay cycle to give
   the impression of better throttle response it seems.  The torque curve
   was very flat once into boost.  I was constantly waiting for that rush
   of power, but before it would come, the car would be bouncing off the
   limiter which BTW, is set too high to be useful wit the K26-8 turbo.
   It was wierd, the car would be making the boost, the speed would increase,
   but the car felt slow.  This was definitely an impression and not
   reality because the boost was being made, just that the flat torque
   curve masked that "feeling".  Boost pressure was similar to the old
   chips, but a bit more conservative.  Boost would spike to 15.5psi and
   then immediately drop to 14.5 and then go downwards towards redline.
   At 6800rpm, the car barely made 12.5psi.  This chipset was by far the
   easiest to drive.  The car felt very much like a TT Supra.  For every
   inch of pedal travel you gave it, the car moved accordingly, very
   linear and responsive, or in other words, BORING.
   Up the test road, this chipset reached 140km/h.
  
3. I don't know exactly the details on what these chips were originally
   created for.  This is what my car came with.  I called AJ-USA who
   sold them to the PO.  They said any computer they sold before APE was
   bought from Andial.  I called Andial and read the part numbers and they
   said it was the Turbo Cup computers.  I always thought the turbo cup
   cars ran race gas, but the person at Andial said that they had to use
   spec 92 octane gas and that's why they sold them for the street.  He
   also said there is a 100 octane version of the same chipset that really
   flies but needs race gas at all times.  Perhaps mine are from the
   Canadian series???  Whatever the case, these chips mimick the stock
   feel, except they have a lot more top end power.  Nothing really happens
   until about 3500rpm and then it comes in with a big rush.  Very similar
   to stock, just more power.  There is that surging that comes from the O2
   sensor trying to keep things lean and clean at part throttle, the other
   two chips did not have the surging.  You can get rid of the surging by
   disconnecting the O2 sensor and letting the computer run off it's preset
   maps.  Apparently, this was used frequently as a cheat way back when
   to reduce lag.  Boost pressure 14.7psi right to the top.  These chips
   maintain 1 bar right up to redline which is set at 6800rpm rather than
   the 7200rpm of the APE chips.  This chipset feels free-er, like the
   engine is less strained.  I think this feeling comes from the timing
   not being massaged as has been done with the APE chips.  As far as
   ease of driving, these are the worst, totally unpredictable when the


   surge is going to come and generally, very 930 turbo like, or in other
   words, more fun than anything else on the road!
   Up the test road, this chipset reached 150km/h.
