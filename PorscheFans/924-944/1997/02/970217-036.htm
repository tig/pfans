My 1987 944S NA has a slight problem with surging. When cruising at a
steady throttle setting there is a slight surging. Also if I let off or add
throttle a lot at a time it surges once or twice. It's minor enough that
passengers don't even notice. I thought it was play in the clutch or drive
train but lately it's started to get worse and I also notice a very light
coating of black soot on the exhaust. My exhaust has never had this before.
The weather has been the pits lately so I havn't had it out for good run in
a while. Today I took it out for a hard drive of about 150 kilometers. The
soot if anything seems a little worse which indicates to me that it's
running a little rich. Does this sound like an O2 sensor?

Thanks, Kerry
