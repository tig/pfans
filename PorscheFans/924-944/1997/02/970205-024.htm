Response to Jim Richmond's post regarding getting head studs out:



Clark Archer, a frequent poster has indicated that his studs have so far been 
easy to take out.  From the message he sent me, it doesn't seem that he has 
needed heat, at least yet (several studs left to go).  I've been told that it 
is far easier to get the studs out with the engine out of the car, so that you 
can apply any necessary heat to the right location.

As for my problems, so far the seepage that I saw last weekend upon first 
firing up the car has not reappeared after several drives to work.  There is no 
sign of coolant getting into the cylinders, so maybe I have a good gasket seal.  
I am suspecting the water outlet port seal against the head even more strongly-- 
I have a few more tests to run.

One theory is that I overfilled the coolant system after I was done with 
reassembly, and upon first running up the motor, the pressure build up pushed 
coolant out at this water outlet port seal because it was the weakest point.  
Maybe after a few heat cycles, it has sealed up.  That is a longshot theory, 
but potentially plausible, based upon direct observations.

I like science projects better when they have more predicatable answers.
