The rotors really don't have that much wear built into them.  I tried to
turn mine
down and found that once they were cleaned up they were too thin to
reuse.  Seems
like you can only go 1.8 mm wear before they must be replaced.  The
Haynes manual
says the wear limit is 2 mm, but this is the manual than says 944 83-89
SOHC on the
front, so I'm not sure how much applies to the 951.

It is very possible that you need new rotors.  Looking over the records
for my car,
the PO went through front rotors rather quickly--the car is on it's 4th
set now at
124,000 miles.  If you have the dealer do the work, they should be able
to do the
brakes in 3 hours at most.  I've done the front rotors myself at total
time was 1.5
hours including cleanup.  The first one took the majority of the time.
They are probably
budgeting in new brake pad wear sensors as well.  I can easily see that
they might
charge around $800-$1000 for the work, including parts.  But, if you are
inclined
to do the work, you can save quite a bit.  I picked up new OEM front
rotors for
$75 from Paragon Products along with a set of Repco pads at $34 for the
front set.
Total investment for new front brakes: $184 plus 1.5 hours of my time.

Sounds suspicious to me....did they also recommend a new radiator? :)
