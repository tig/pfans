	Charles, no not really. That is, a perfectly running 924S
	shouldn't have a problem with the cold. Check the usual things
	that might go bad on a car this old and only show up in the
	cold i.e. spark plugs, wires, O2 sensor, etc. It's probably
	only a minor glitch but one of those things that'll take
	you 3 weeks and 250 man-hours to track down and will cost
	$3.50 in parts. Good luck!
