Reading the ongoing thread about hot starting the 924 is like i am hearing
myself describing the problem.  I have a 1978 model by reading the Haynes
manual i noticed that in the 1979 model, to overcome problems with hot
starting a hot start solenoid was added to the system.   What this does is
takes a wire from the +ive terminal on the cold start injector and runs it
to a solenoid that connects the feed line for the control pressure
regulator to the return line.  The -ive terminal is connected to a
temperature switch inserted into the coolant return line.  When active at
45 degrees C the temperature switch connects the line from the solenoid to
earth (ie. it switches on). This activates the solid allowing the fuel from
the top of the fuel distributor to return to the fuel return line (much
like the warm up value does when the engine is cold).  This in turn lifts
the plunger in the fuel distributor allowing fuel to enter into the
injector lines and this in turn adds the necessary pressure in the lines.  
Connecting the +ive terminal of the solenoid to the +ive terminal of the
cold start value ensures that this only happens when the starter is
activated.

NOTE : the above was only done on the 1979 model. ie for models with the
CIS system.  1980 or later got the Lambda injection which is similar but
different.

I'm thinking of adding the above to my beast.  It should only be a bit of
soldering, two parts - the solenoid and the temp switch, two cables with
adapters to connect to the fuel lines  I think ?
