Hey dudes,

It seems that people enjoyed the chip comparison post, so I'll go into
a few more things we've learnt over the last few days.  I hate weight.
I really hate weight.  I hated the 3300lb Talon and I hate weight!  So,
I wanted to see how much the wheel/tire combos weighed to give an idea
of places to improve.  According to Fred Puhn (How to make your car
handle) (it may be Herb Adams, I can't remember), taking weight off the
car at road speed is equivalent to removing 3X that weight from the car's
body in terms of acceleration and removing weight at engine speed is
equivalent to removing 15X that weight off the body in terms of acceleration.

Since I have no plans to take apart this motor, I wanted to see how much
weight can be removed at road speed.  This has two benefits, one being
a reduction in rotating mass, and two, less unsprung weight makes the car
handle better and react faster to steering movement.

The 17" cup wheels with Dunlop SP8000 tires came out to be 50lbs!  That's
pretty heavy.  The 16" Turbo S wheels with R1 race tires came out at a 
hefty 44lbs.  Just that 6lb difference per wheel/tire works out to:

6x4=24 (total car) x3 = 72lb

So, using the 16" wheels with the R1s is like removing 72lb from the
body in terms of acceleration.  Not bad, but the weight could be lower.
I know that the Hoosiers that I normally run are considerably lighter
than the R1 tire.  My goal is to get the wheel/tire down to 40lbs total.
We'll see if I make it.

Next thing is fuel economy.  I've been suspecting that my O2 sensor is
dying.  The reason behind that theory is I've got this irritating surging
at part throttle as the car runs very lean at this point.  Some people
say it's normal, but that seems hard to believe (unless it's some
ridiculous EPA thing Porsche had to meet).  I've noticed that when the
Autothority chips are installed, this disappears, so it kind of muddies
my theory of the O2 sensor being bad.  Maybe it's just the stock
fuel curves run really lean at part throttle and my Turbo Cup computers
don't really have much "tuning" done to them, just raw power added.  So,
how to keep the cup computers but get rid of the surging?  Disconnect
the O2 sensor.  I drove to Bremerton and back with it disconnected and
the car feels much smoother, has the same gas mileage and gets rid of
that surging and at the same time, brings boost on faster.  The only
thing I could see being bad is if the car has a problem and starts to
run rich, the computer would have no way to get feedback and the cat might
get clogged up.

Am I correct in assuming that the O2 sensor is ignored at WOT?

I managed to get 23mpg on the way down to Bremerton and back.  This figure
includes three 70 second autocross runs.  Not bad eh?  With Mobil 1 in
the pan, there was also no oil used, which is surprising because my car
was a real oil hog.

Next item is more boost pressure testing.  GET A GAUGE!!!  The stock gauge
is totally inaccurate past its intended range.  We hooked one up to Paul's
car and it peaks at 19psi and almost immediately drops down to 13psi.  My
car in the same temps and conditions (tested back to back) goes up to 17psi
and then drops to 15psi and then down to 13.5psi.  Paul's will sometimes
stay up near 17psi and then drop to 13psi.  Mine will try and stay at 15psi
and then drop to 13.5psi at redline.  19psi!!!  That's a lot of boost,
but I guess it's part of the design.  I think POrsche used to call it,
"overtake boost" or something like that.  With the stock boost bolt in place,
it looks like it's 11-12psi at overtake and then 10psi normal, quite a
difference.

The new Autothority chips are definitely MUCH more conservative with
their peak boost and overal boost.  That must mean that a lot of people
probably blew up head gaskets or something with the older chipsets.

Autothority says that there were no changes over the years, but I've
got numbers to show otherwise.

That's all for now.  There's an event on March 9th at Kent WA, we'll
be there!

I still find it pretty amazing how enthusastic I am about this car!

Farzaan.
89 951 14+psi :)
