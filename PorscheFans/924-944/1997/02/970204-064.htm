"MMitchel asked about removing 944 head studs"

Mine would still be in if I didn't have a pro supervising.  The only way those
devils will come out is with heat.  Double nut or use a fancy stud puller,
double nut works fine.  Heat the stud to a dull red, I forget how many degrees
my builder said that was.  Take a 1/2 or 3/4" breaker bar, slide a 4' section of
pipe (cheater bar) over it and add a six point socket.  Crank the sucker until
you swear it will break and the stud will finally break loose with a bang.
After the first one is out, the rest are not as nerve racking.

I can't give you any first hand experience with the Raceware studs because the
engine is not together yet.  Everyone I have talked to has had good luck with
them.

If I was doing this for the first time, by myself, I might consider renting a
junk core from a dismantler to practice on.
