                Frankie again, I have just received my verification on the
mail I had previously sent.  I do apologize for the incoherent statement
"When he arrives from England . . ." but I have been reviewing for a
pre-calc. exam tomorrow.  To finish the statement I was in conversation with
my friends father when told me about his old 924  and that he was going to
have to sell it soon b/c of a job transfer. So I jumped on it.  End of story,
but I also forgot to mention that I noticed w/ the new boxster there is a
publication on its model and was just wondering if there was one for the 924.
 Also if anyone has any 924 shots on your comp. please send,

                                    with the greatest and most sincere
esteem,       



















                                                                      Frankie
