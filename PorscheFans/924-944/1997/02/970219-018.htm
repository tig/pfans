Hey dudes,

The event:
Well, we all made it back in one piece!  What an event, talk about a huge
lot.  I would estimate the course was 8X the size of our local track.
The Fordahls had designed the course big open and flowing so that the
turbo guys wouldn't be sitting in lag all the time, but the course was
still very technical.  It seemed like every corner was set up to test
how much nerve you had to stay in it.

We had a lot of fun even with the long drives there and back.  Taking the
ferry back was a good idea and taking race tires was also a good idea
because it was dry all day long.  The machinery in this region is wild.
There were two race prepped 911TT, tons of 993s, a gourgeous RS America,
and lots and lots and lots of red 944's.  It was embarrassing for me
to run because people would see Bill Buetow's 944 S2 go up and run an
awesome time and then I'd go up in a car that looks almost identical and
run way slower.  Bill Buetow has to be one of the greatest drivers on this
earth, definitely in my top 5.  His car control is almost magic like.
Just riding with him has got me all wound up to try things that he did with
his car.  I think I learned more in 64 seconds with him than I learned
in the last 2 years of autocrossing!

You can see pics of the event at http://www.buschurracing.com/bremerton
Apparently, the picture of Bill is actually not Bill.

It was fun meeting all the guys I converse with over the net like
Scottie B, the Fordahls (who are super nice I might add) and so many more.

I managed to achieve my goal of being fastest of the cars we came with.
Our times were as follows:

		1st		2nd		3rd
Farzaan	72.900 +2s	69.615		68.476
Paul		72.500 +2s	70.509		68.900 +40s
Roger		70.124 +14s	68.512 +28s	77.982 +6s

Paul lost the back end on his last run and took out half the course cutting
it pretty short which accounts for his good time without the penalties added.
They stopped counting the penalties at 40 seconds :)

Roger has been my rival for a year or two now.  He owns a heavily 
modified Talon AWD.  Last year, he beat me when I was running my Talon,
but a years worth of practice and a new car, I was able to finally
get him.  It would have been very bad if he had beaten me;  there's
nothing worse than the car you sold to beat you.

Roger spun his car on his last run too, but didn't whack too much.  I don't
know how he got 28 seconds in penalties on his second run, but it was
likely from missing a gate or two (10 seconds per gate missed).

Derek, Darren (from this list) and Lu all did around 72-74 seconds with
cones but showed a lot of promise of being really, really fast.

All in all, a really fun event.  We'll be going back frequently.  I 
encourage everyone to come with us next time.  It was quite a picture
seeing four 944Ts and three Talons going down the highway together.

One thing I really liked about this course was that it had everything
in it, slaloms, offset gates, chicago box, cross court shots, everything
that could show up in a course was in this course, really good practice.

Paul, Darren, Lu and I will likely also go to the March 6th, Weather or
Not event at Kent.  Maybe some of you guys might want to come out.  I'll
try and get Tim and Wes to also come out.

The car:
The car felt really, really good out there for some reason.  It felt
really strong.  Maybe it was Scottie White's awesome Corvette rubbing
off on my car or maybe my car developed modifications-envy so it decided
to add another few lbs of boost.  

I was running the normal 14psi of boost so nothing special.  I was 
surprised at how precise the car was considering the amount of body roll
it has.  Paul absolutely loved his car out there.  I don't think I've
ever seen a group of people have so much fun as we did out there.  What
a blast.  I feel this event was more fun than the track day I went out to
last year, just because everything happened so fast and the competition
level was high.  It would kind of be like running a track event with 
Hans Stuck riding in the 944 in front of you.

I ran R1 tires to try them out.  They were borrowed from Tim S. because
my Hoosiers are not here yet.  The tires were rock hard and I had a lot
of trouble putting power down, but towards the end of the day, they were
starting to get a bit better.  I actually am not a fan of R1 tires, but
this time, I liked the way they felt.  The sizes were 225/50R16 on 16x7
fronts and 245/45R16 on 16x9 rears.  The wheels are UGLY because the shop
chromed them instead of anodizing them, but hey, I was borrowing them so
I can't complain too much.

How does this combination work?  16x8 S2 rear wheels for the front of my
89 Turbo and stock 16x9 rear Turbo S wheels for the rear?

You guys have got to come out and race your car.  The cars love it like
no other car I've had before.  What a rush!

Farzaan.
