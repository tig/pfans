Oil pressure depends on the type of oil as much as on the operating temp. I'm 
guessing you use 20W-50 because running 10W-30 in outside temps of 100F, the 
pressure in my '84 944 sinks to a low of 1 bar (idle) in city driving. The 
owner's manual says a "normal" low can be 0.5bar at idle, so that is probably 
with an even lighter oil.

In any case the more important reading is pressure when the engine needs oil, 
at full loads. Regardless of outside temps I get a pressure of 5 bar at 4000 
rpm. If pressure at load is less than 3.5 bar or so, you need to start 
worrying.
