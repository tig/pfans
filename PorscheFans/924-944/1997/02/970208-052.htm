Well, I knew it was a project when I bought it..
but then I only paid $700.00 for it.  
I got the fuel tank out and it is in the radiator shop
getting cleaned and sealed.  The leak I had when I jacked
up to car was a rust hole in the upper part of the tank.
The fuel in this thing was real nasty.. I'm running it through
my MG diluted with good gas to get rid of it.  Both of the fuel
pumps were stopped up.  I managed to get both of them apart 
and cleaned and they seem to be working now.  The plunger in
the fuel distributor was stuck so I took it apart (a brave act,
but what do I have to lose?) and cleaned it up and put it back
together.  I also blew out all fuel lines and injector lines
with compressed air.  The oil has been changed and some oil 
squirted into each cylinder, followed by new spark plugs.
After a lengthy prayer and with helpers with fire extinguishers
I hope to crank it over on Sunday.. thanks for your helpful advice
on reviving long dormant p-cars.  Oh, I changed the fuel filter too..
it was completely blocked.  I've got a couple of questions.

1)  If my rebuild on the external fuel pump doesn't work, is it 
    interchangeable with VW rabbit, etc?  It looks an awful lot
    like the ones in my VW book.  Does anyone have any experience 
    with an interchange.  My brother had a 924 several years ago
    and said he got a VW pump for about half what a "porsche" pump
    cost, but he doesn't remember any specifics.

2)  If I need to buy a new one, where would be a good place to go.  I've 
    ordered an AUTOMOTION catalog but it hasn't arrived yet.  Anyone have
    some catalogs and can give me an idea of prices?

Thanks again for your help..it makes a difference
