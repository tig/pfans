I have been member for a about a week so I am new at this  

Today I took the door about to replace the door handle (door did not open) 
and I found that the window track inside the door under the handle had
broken off, the welds had just failed.  I thought that this was strange was
I look at a soon to be ITS 944 race car that was in shop and found the same
thing.  I am planing to take the glass out of my car and tig the track back
in.
Does this happen a lot?
