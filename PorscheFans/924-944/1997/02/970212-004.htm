Olav - all of them do this, the only way to stop it for a while is to get a 
new p/s rack ($$$). My car has about 92k miles on it and last summer I was 
bleeding all kindsa fluids anyway (radiator, brakes, oil, tranny) so I thought 
I'd try flushing the p/s system since the noise was getting annoying. Dextron 
is cheap so I emptied the old fluid (pulled one of the lower hoses to the 
pump) and poured a coupla bottles through the system. Finally changed hoses 
and clamps and new fluid, and surprise, the noise was completely gone. Did not 
hear it all through summer and the power assist seemed to be higher at low 
speeds (could be imagining this), and this winter it is barely audible.

You might try this, but first check that p/s fluid is in the reservoir and not 
leaking. If you lose fluid try changing the useless factory clamps. Also avoid 
turning lock to lock at -20F at 800 RPM! Good luck.
