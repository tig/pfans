Hi,

I didn't want you guys to think that all I cared about
was my stereo, so here goes...

I used to own a 924 which I desperately wanted to be a 944.
I spent many dollars to that end and still had a 924. It did
look cool when you opened the hood (Mikuni dual sidedrafts),
but it really didn't get much faster. I tried a new big-valve
head, crank-fire ignition, exhaust, you name it. I loved that
car, but God bless it's heart, it just would not go! I'm still
paying for some of that stuff. So I traded for my current '84.

Two days after buying this car, I got to drive my first 944T.
Big mistake. My question is this... what, if any, simple mods
can be made to this car that will actually make a difference.
Having driven the turbo, I know this isn't my last Porsche.
But I still like to tinker, and I expect to have this car for
quite a while. I was recently told by an independent service
facility that the only things worth doing are: K & N (already
done), mild performance cam grind, and exhaust. What are your
thoughts on this? A Borla cat-back would cost about half of
what the car is worth. That ain't happening. What about
Bursch? I'm sure this is old news to you guys, but I just
got here. Any info you provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

ROG

'84 944 Alpine White
