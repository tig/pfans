My '86 951's cruise control has been doing some weird stuff.  It used to
operate perfectly, but it seems to have "fallen out of adjustment" during
the time that the car sits while I'm in school.  Either that, or it has a
mind of its own.  When I engage cruise for the first time (this doesn't
happen all of the time, about 50%), it accelerates and engages 15 mph higher
than the speed I intended to maintain.  (This is very annoying!)  Before,
when I thought my cruise control was "working properly," I remember that my
cruise always set 3 or 4 mph above speed I initially engaged at.  I thought
this was okay, but now I believe it was a symptom of what's developed now.
Not only do I sometimes have this automatic acceleration problem when I
engage cruise control, but it's started to decide to disengage cruise
control by itself whenever it wants.  I'll be flying at a constant speed,
then suddenly I will feel my car dive forward and lose its speed as if a
ghost had released the throttle.
        Is my car haunted and trying to kill me, or is there a specific
problem with the cruise control than I should be aware of?  Anybody know
what's going on or have this happen to them?  Thanks for any help on this
matter.
