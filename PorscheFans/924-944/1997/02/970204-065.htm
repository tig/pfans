 Try gold fish. They held pretty good in mine. That is until I fixed the =
problem. Well I should say I alleviated the water in the light assembly. =
After Trying unsuccessfully to remove the tail light assembly (Porsche =
uses some sealant that really bonds well) I took a very small drill bit =
and drilled a hole in the bottom of the lens to drain the water. I never =
could see where the water was entering, that is I could find no evidence =
of anything getting wet. Other than a lens half full of water. So I =
attributed it to a leak in the lens seal. I drilled at the very bottom =
of each lens with a fine wire drill bit, at an upward angle.  I did this =
last year, and so far it seems to work. Though with such a fine hole, I =
check to make sure it's not clogged once in a while
