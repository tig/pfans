Porschefans:

As I understand it, 968s had a base price just under $40,000 when introduced
in 1992, and were usually optioned to the mid $40s.  I have no idea about any
discounting, but I would suspect that Chrysler-style discounting never went
on at Porsche dealers.  For 93-95, I think that the prices were not changed.
 The reason for saying this is that I checked the Edmund's web site for used
cars which has a column for price when new.  This figure did not vary for any
of the 4 model years.  Given the poor sales of the 968 (and all sports cars
from 92-95, including the MR2 turbo, the RX-7, the 300ZX, the Supra, though
not the Miata), I suspect the lack of demand kept the prices flat.

I will check the Kelley Blue Book page on the Web to confirm all this.
