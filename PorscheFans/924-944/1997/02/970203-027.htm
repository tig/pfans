I own a 944S2 Cab. and I also ran across that cylindrical weight in the
passenger side of the trunk. I called Porsche Customer service in Reno, and
they put me in touch with Tom Hiser, the west coast Service Mgr. (I believe
that was his title) anyway the individual who replied that this was a
vibration damper was correct. According to Tom, Porsche had a few
occurrences of a harmonic vibration on the cabriolets in Europe (no problems
were ever noted in the US) however, this large, heavy and ominous looking
item is Porsche's fix for the problem. I'm contemplating removing mine on a
trial basis to see if I experience a similar vibration problem. If not then
getting rid of 25 or so pounds in a performance oriented car seems like a
good thing, yes?
