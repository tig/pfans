Well harsh comparation should I say. I've seen quite a few big "safe"
cars flattened out afer a wreck. Depends what you might consider as
being trivial. Also you must not forget, the status of luxury and/or
sports cars that Porsches, Jags, Astons, etc have. Finition, security
and sturdiness are synonim. You might see some Trans-ams, any american
iron, is completly destroyed after the most banal crashes. So it does
not mean that you will be more exposed on your sentra then in your
Porsche, and also not overvalue an unibody construction to a more common
body over chassi arrangement, mainly 'cause if you get a biker at full
speed on you side, unless you have a mack truck, you will be badly
hurt... his body will litteraly pierce the stell like butter...

ps: don't hit a cow or a moose or have a suicidal squirel make a whole
on your side door :)
