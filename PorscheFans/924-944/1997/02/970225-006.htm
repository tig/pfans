I am slowly getting sick of the minor, but intensely irritating electrical
problems that have been plaguing my '84 944 in the last 2 months. With the
help of this list I have managed to solve most of them, so here goes:

Coming back from work in the rain the rear wiper wouldn't work. I used it
less than 2 days ago, and it has never had any problems before. Wiper
motor is fine (checked continuity) and the center console switch has
power. I can't figure out what the h#$* the switch does because it seems
to have 0 resistance in both on and off positions, i.e. the wiper should
be always on (which it wasn't). Also, what does the third wire to the rear
wiper switch and to the wiper motor do?  There is a red and a black wire
(ground and +12 I assume) and a green wire that does not seem to do much. 

If anybody knows what the three wires do and where the power source is
(fuse is fine) I can check for relays/inline fuses. I can't figure out
where the little switch taps power (when it worked, the wiper had switched
power, from the ignition). TIA.
