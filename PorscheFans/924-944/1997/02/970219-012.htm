My suggestion would be to replkace the Pads/Rotors yourself.

It is fairly easy and ALOT less expensive.

If you look in Excellence you'll find '87 rotors
for $ 66/58 F and R, and pads can be had for $100 = 375 including shipping.

(NOPI 800-227-6674)

Once you remove the wheel, all you do is remove the caliper (2 bolts,
one line clip) and two philips head scres (get an impact screwdriver)
and the rotors pop off.  On the '87 there is no bearing 
removal, the rotors are "Hats"

Buy an impact screwdriver (craftsman, $14) and save $625 for two hour's work.

Okay... I take my '87 951 into the dealer for a service and they inform me
that I need new rotors.   Apparently there are only "2mm" left all the way
around.  After some questioning, I determine that what they REALLY mean is
that they are 2mm under "spec".  

I don't go on the track and am very very very easy on the brakes. (( I hardly
ever use them.. honest! ))  Do I really need new rotors?  Or would they be
fine for another year?  The car has 81K on it.  Any opinions would be very
appreciated.  Estimated cost for brake pads and rotors:  ((kaching..  S} cash
register))  $1,000.

Also, they said I had a radiator leak, but four months later have never had
to add coolant  (yes I look constantly).  They said it can sometimes plug
itself up.  Are they B.S.ing me?
