Hello,

The discussion about the pricing of 944T is interesting.  I agree with
the fellow from WA in that in certain areas, Bruce Anderson's prices
are a bit too low.  I have not read the article, so I'm going only
on what I've read here so far so don't shoot me if he says that the
west coast has higher prices.  The US$20,000 price that the fellow
paid in WA is reasonable for that low mileage.  Out here in B.C. where
Porsche is the second most popular car behind Acura's (I'm being
sarcastic, but really not that far off), a nice, clean 89 944T will
run you around C$26,000 or US$20,000.  I paid close to C$29,000 for
mine, but it has sport seats and had very low mileage (44,000km).  Paul
bought his for around C$27,000 last week.  His also has low mileage
(45,000km), but no sport seats.  The cheapest 89 944T I've seen around
here was a beautiful silver one that was going for C$21,000, but it
had 116,000km on it and a pretty hard life.  This was the first Porsche
I had ever test driven that had warped rotors.  How you warp a 12"
fat rotor like that in a 3000lb car I have no idea, but he did it
and I didn't buy :)

I have a really long post coming on some testing I did on my car over
the last week, but I'll wait until the list server is fixed up to
ensure that I don't pull down the entire Internet because it decides
to multiply into a pseudo virus and I end up on the cover of Wired
magazine!

Farzaan.
