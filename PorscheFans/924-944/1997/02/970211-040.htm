>George, could you tell us what, and where, you posted your repeating post?

Hi, Marv,

My post was initiated at 1430 on Feb. 5th, sent to 6 lists,
racing@porschefans.com
PorscheFans-911@porschefans.com
PorscheFans-356@porschefans.com
PorscheFans-928@porschefans.com
PorscheFans-914@porschefans.com
PorscheFans-924-944@porschefans.com

Every hour or so, I would get a response from all of the lists with the 
exception of racing@porschefans.com that the message had been forwarded
(as if I wasn't intimately aware already).

I did get a couple of messages saying that there was a problem
(porschefans.com 
was busy and unable to accept the message, and that the server would attempt
to retry until the message was five days old.

Today (the sixth day) I received a message from that same server that the
message delivery was unsuccessful and that it would stop trying...

Our long national nightmare is now over...

I surmise that somehow, PorscheFans is set to not accept a message to more
than five lists at a time.

For myself, I will continue to make postings, but will not send the same
message to more than two lists at a time, unless I want to test the patience
of the readers...

I will say that a couple of readers were sympathetic about the situation,
and that more than a couple (who have not posted anything constructive to 
the list) were less than civil with their posts.  To those of you, I give
you the italian salute...

George Beuselinck

-- [ From: Jim Bergman, PorscheFans Listmaster * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Hello everyone,

The PorscheFans list has recently been experiencing a problem where the
ability to receive new mail (SMTP) shuts itself down.  I'm working on the
problem with NTMail tech support, but we haven't found a solution yet.  I
apologize for the repeated messages this is causing.  It's driving us all
crazy (no pun intended).

It varys from a few hours to three days how long it runs normally, then
starts to act up.  The response I've received from NTMail technical support
has NOT been very helpful or timely.  I just installed a beta version of the
SMTP server -- we'll see if that helps.

Just wanted to keep you up to date on the problem.  Thank you for all your
helpful suggestions and your patience.

   - Jim Bergman
     PorscheFans Listmaster
