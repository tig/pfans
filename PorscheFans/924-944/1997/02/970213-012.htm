   Hello again Porsche fans:
    
    Need help with power mirror wiring diagram. The subject is a '87 944 that
was a previous theft (light strip). The car was put back together, and to the
layman is a beautiful auto. Beauty is only skin deep. Since the power mirror
joystick would not function I removed the door panel to see what the problem
would be. It seems that joystick is not even hooked up. I then went to both
mirrors and check for any obvious signs of malfunction and located my wiring
diagram for this car. The wiring diagram does not match that of the colored
leads going to and from mirror motors. Also in removing mirror, I learned
that they had the early style fastening system, without bayonet fasteners.
These must be early style mirrors. Can anyone tell me the corresponding
colors  (from early to late) so that I can wire my mirrors. Am I correct in
that there is a difference between the two. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  Also the console is wired for the crossover for the mirror with
the correct late style wiring.   Thanks .

 Alec Miller     Bert67@aol.com
