According to the Racer Wholesale catalog I received today, the street pads
for your car have a coefficient of friction of .44 and an operating
temperature range of 100F to 900F. The catalog price is $126.72 for the
fronts and $76.80 for the rears (per axle). I have not used the street pads.

I use the Hawk Blue (racing) pads for track events. The Coefficient of
Friction of the blues is .55, with a temp. range of 600F to 1400F. Price for
your car: $163.20 (front) and $91.20 (rear).

Compared to Cool Carbons, the Hawk blue pads:

   1.  Don't require extensive break in; just a couple of medium stops and a
couple of aggressive stops.

   2.  Don't require heating up. These pads hook up instantly, even when
cold (but cold in Florida is probably a heat wave where you are). I did run
them at Sebring once when the temp was in the 30s and they were fine right
from the start.

   3.  Haven't caused problems due to being changed for every track event.
(Cool carbons sorta liked fresh rotors every time you changed them).

   4.  Are *extremely* dusty. I use them only with my track wheels and I
change the pads before and after every event. 

Hope some of this helps.

Mike
