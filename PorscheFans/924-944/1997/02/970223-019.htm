Jay, Ron

I have been experiencing similar problems recently. I had minor problems
that I discounted as 'flushing,' until the short hose behind the block
broke open on me. After replacement, things haven't been the same.

The temperature cycle on my car is simliar to what Ron described. Gets
hot but eventually cools. Turning the heater on definitely helps.

A couple of questions:

1. The heat in the car stops working when at idle. If I accelerate the
motor to about 2000 rpm it starts to operate ok. I sometimes hear water
running through the heater core at this point. My observation here is
'air in the system.' I've filled the system many times but... well read
2. Have either of you experienced this?

2. I'm losing coolant on a regular basis. The water *appears* to be
boiling out. With the temperature way up, I'm not surprised. I've
checked for leaks, water in collant etc and none apply. The fans operate
fine. Sound familiar?

3. Sometimes, when the coolant level is good (after I just filled it) I
have massive coolant leaks as follows: After heating the car up by
driving around, I'll stop the car, and then coolant will spew out of the
resevoir all over the place - about a quart at a time. It sounds as if
the pressure in the system is being releived, because there is some
spontaneousness (sp?) to it. I can't beleive that there is too much
pressure in the system, unless the engine is really hot. But could a
blockage cause this kind of reaction - ie the pressure is building up
because water can't circulate?

4. I have checked the water pump pressure. It seems ok when running, but
I suspect it might be weak. tis would explain the water not getting
around to the heater. After a long cool down period (1 hour) there is
still plenty of pressure in the system. 

I'm interested to hear if you have similar problems. My plan of attack
is to have a mechanic pressure test the system to look for leaks, and
check the water pump. I'm also curious about the water pump seal. I'll
have that checked too!

Anyway, I'll definitely let you know if I find anything.

> P.S. If you've read this far, you're really sick and twisted ;)

.... or deperate!
