Folks, before Christmas I wrote with a question about rain water somehow 
getting inside my 83 944 and pooling under the passenger seat. I received a 
number of very helpful responses, several of which referred me to the 
classic problem of battery-tray corrosion and leakage.

The problem turned out to be the battery tray, all right, but not 
corrosion-induced leakage. Instead there is a seam running around the 
battery tray which forms the bottom and sides Of the tray. This seam was 
caulked with some kind of material but the caulking was breaking loose and 
flaking away, allowing water to leak through the seam into the passenger 
compartment. I recaulked the seam and no further water leaks.

So thanks to all who helped me find the problem. And to show how grateful I 
am, another question: is household silicone-based caulk safe for this 
application? If not, what is a good alternative?

Thanks in advance
