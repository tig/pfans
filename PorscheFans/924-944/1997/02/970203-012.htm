Repco MetalMasters have a reputation as being a good pad for both street
and track. They don't work as well as all-out race pads, but they're not as
harsh on your rotors either. I put metalMasters on my '87 Turbo last
summer. I think they're great. They need to be warmed up a bit before
they're fully effective; just be careful the first stop or two of the day.
After that they grab smooth and strong. Every once in a while, they'll
squeak a bit. I haven't had the chance to use them on the track, yet. I'll
buy them again when I need to. They're reasonably priced, too. I'd second
Charlie's recommendation.
