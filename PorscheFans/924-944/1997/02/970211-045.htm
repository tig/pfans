Dave -- did indeed get this suggestion quite a few times but unfortunately
I still cannot diagnose the problem. My 944 has close to 92k miles but
there is no sign of corrosion anywhere, including the battery area. The
wetness in my car is strictly restricted to the rear mats and carpets,
front carpets are dry as ever.

The best suggestion so far comes from Roger Moore (007?!) who told me he
never figured the leak out either, but when he replaced his dying sunroof
seals and cleared the drain vents the moisture in the rear carpets
mysterioualy disappeared. I have never ever seen the roof leak or seen any
water marks on the rear seat leather so it is hard for me to understand
the source of this moisture. The only thing I can think of is a connection
between drain pipes, somewhere en route from the roof to the outlets in
the storage bins, that has gone bad. However my sunroof seals are due to
be replaced anyway so I will do that and let you know if it helps.

If you know anything about the drain hoses from the roof and how to
replace them, or any other ideas to get rid of this annoying problem (and
probably a fast way to get that corrosion started) please email -- thanks.
