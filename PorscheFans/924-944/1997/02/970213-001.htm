David,

I'm not a lot of help on the camber gauge (I just borrow a friends with a 
level's "bubble in a glass tube").

For toe, I just use a friend's toe-tool that is elegent and simple enough to 
make.   There are only three parts that need to be fabricated.  A 6" long 
aluminum bar (about an inch wide and 1/4 inch thick), cut to into a wedge so 
that one end is a point, and the other end has the full width remaining.   
Mount (4 screews) this at 90 degrees to a similar aluminum bar that is almost 
the width of your cas wheelsr.  At the other end, mount a carpenters T guide 
(the kind where it is a ruler and the handle can be slid and locked in 
place).....

Here comes the BAD ASCII graphics, change to Courier (fixed) font....

                                             X     X

<-Aluminum bar width of car-><-------- Carpenter's T-Square-->
The "S" indicates where screws are used to attach the pieces, the "L" is the 
'screw type lock' used to set the sliding handle at desired length along the 
ruled T-Square


End BAD ASCII Graphics.

Now all you have to do is put the point into one of the tire treads and measure 
the distance to the same tread on the opposite tire, front and back of each set 
of tires.  The difference between the front-of-the-tire-measurement and the 
rear-of-the-tire-measurement determines toe.

It's a little bit of work, but sure beats $700! and works a whole lot better 
than string!


There is more to alligning the car, and keeping the toe symetric to the rest of 
the car, but that's for another time......
