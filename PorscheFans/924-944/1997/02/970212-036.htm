The '88 and later cars have a spring-loaded tensioner which is bolted
down during normal operation. It is used during the normal tensioning
process by bringing the crank to TDC, loosening the restraint to allow
the spring to load the belt, and then torquing the restraint to maintain
the tension. Not the exact procedure but you get the idea.

Althought the spring tensioner is not particularly prone to failure, it
is a good idea to schedule a check of the actual tension provided by this
method. The check requires the gauge. And of course you still have to
tension the balance shaft belt, with the gauge, so you need a gauge if
you are going to do this yourself.
