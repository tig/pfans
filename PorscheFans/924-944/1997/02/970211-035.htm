I'm trying to find a clean 944/911 that's already set up for the track
(suspension mods, cage/rollbar, harnesses, etc, but street legal) --
somebody suggested looking through the classifieds in the local PCA
chapter's newsletter. Since I don't own a Porsche at this point, I'm
obviously not a member of the PCA and, therefore, don't have access to
the newsletter at this point. I was wondering if some PCA member from
the Carolinas chapter could provide me with a copy of the classifieds
via fax. I'd be happy to buy you a beer for your trouble if you're in
or around Raleigh, NC.

Out of curiosity -- was anybody on this list at the PCA event at
Rockingham in June(?) last year? I spoke with several people there but
don't really remember any names. (I was the person in the red 3rd gen
RX-7.)

Thanks,
Amit

-- [ From: Jim Bergman, PorscheFans Listmaster * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Hello everyone,

The PorscheFans list has recently been experiencing a problem where the
ability to receive new mail (SMTP) shuts itself down.  I'm working on the
problem with NTMail tech support, but we haven't found a solution yet.  I
apologize for the repeated messages this is causing.  It's driving us all
crazy (no pun intended).

It varys from a few hours to three days how long it runs normally, then
starts to act up.  The response I've received from NTMail technical support
has NOT been very helpful or timely.  I just installed a beta version of the
SMTP server -- we'll see if that helps.

Just wanted to keep you up to date on the problem.  Thank you for all your
helpful suggestions and your patience.

   - Jim Bergman
     PorscheFans Listmaster
