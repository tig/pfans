VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL

   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of 
   messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
   
   The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is 
   10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.  
   Administrators can set message limits using the 
   Mailbox  Settings function available in the 
   Manage User menu  (MUSER). 

   When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the 
   user must delete some of the messages before 
   the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

Looks like you can't tell a Hyundai from a "Huyndai," whatever that is.

> Point being that this person, whatever color, race or creed, is lieing about
                                                                  ^^^^^^
No, the point is daddy left you with the keys to a Porsche and you think you are 
suddenly very cool. Work on your spellings first, stop lying (write that on the 
board now, lying, not "lieing"), and stop making stupid generalizations about 
people and cars you know nothing about ("duuuuh didn't know if she was Chinese 
or Vietnamese". . ."duuuuh and then I go ahead misspell a Korean car's name...")

Less morons like you with your useless drool on this list, and a lot of wasted 
bandwidth would be conserved. Go play somewhere else little boy, this here's the 
men's room!
