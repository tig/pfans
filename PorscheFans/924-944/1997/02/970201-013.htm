Subject: 951 CLUTCH ENGAGE

I have an 86 951,  26k mi  same kind of problem on starting but
reallilng just a minor judder.  It seems to be a function of the
temperature and useage of the car.  If used often the the clutch is
somooth. After sitting for a while 1-2 wks it returns.  Perhaps the disk
material acts like some brake pads which get grabby when wet or cold.

I also had a rattle when starting.  It turned out to be the mounting
bracket on the heat shield right under the exhaust manifold.  The shield
is mounted to the block with two bolts.  The front mount is a tab on the
shield with a hole in it for mounting to the block..  This tab was
cracked in the middle and as a result the two pieces rattled together at
low rpm when starting up.  This is difficult to see since it is located
under the exhaust manifold.  The shield wasn't hitting the manifold but
the mounting bracket was rattling.  This rattle was difficult to find
because there is plenty of clearance between the shield and manifold so
it is not suspect.  Repaired the crack and the rattle dissappeared.
