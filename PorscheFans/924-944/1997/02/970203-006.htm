Jay, I just removed the plate from my 87 951 motor today to which
the oil filter screws.  The seal between this plate is the one
that leaks.  It is a chore, but I had the headers(?) removed
in order to take off the cylinder head, and this seems to have
made it substantially easier.  You can probably do it if you have
jackstands and plenty of extensions and u-joints.  Don't know
how much difficulty it would add to try with the exhaust on.
If you get stuck, perhaps I can help you with specific questions.
