I have a 1980 924 Turbo that has recently developed an intermittent problem with 
starting.  I can push it and pop the clutch and it starts up with no problems, however 
once I turn off the engine it usually won't start, I mean it won't turn over or click or 
anything.  But once in awhile it will start up normally.  My battery is good, so is my 
alternator and so is my coil. I have also checked all of the connections and they all 
appear to be fine. Does the above problem sound like a problem with my solenoid and/or 
my starter?  I would think that if they were bad, I would never be able to start it 
normally.  I would like to know some other possible ideas of what is wrong before I take 
the solenoid and starter off and have them tested.  Thanks,   -Greg
