Alec:

I read an interesting article in Consumer Reports a couple months ago 
about oil.  Sorry, I can't remember the month.  Of course, we're not 
driving taxicabs like their testers, but there procedures seemed sound 
and methodical.

In the report, the testers concluded that any oil having the industry 
standard star on the back with the latest API service rating (SJ?) was 
good for at least 3000 miles with no major reduction in viscosity or 
performance.  They tested Mobil 1 (our favorite?) on a few cars to 
6000 miles, but two of the cars broke from unrelated problems.  
Another conclusion was that oil additives are not effective.

I'm sure these claims don't include severe duty or turbo applications, 
where your oil gets churned into 1000 degree dirty whipped cream by 
the turbo.  I've also heard "through the grapevine" that additives 
with PTFE are very bad for turbos.  Something to do with PTFE turning 
into fluoric acid at high temps.  Unfortunately, I've forgotten my 
chemistry, so I don't know...

Happy oil choosing,
Dave
