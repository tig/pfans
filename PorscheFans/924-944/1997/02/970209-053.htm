Hi, Tom,

Although Bruce's article is consistent with the real market, special
situations
change the local market.

As an example, I inspected a 951S for a client in upstate New York. The price 
was a firm $22500 for a car with 20K miles. After the inspection, my advice
to the client was to buy the car at that price, IF IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT HE
WANTED, since the particular combination in question was fairly rare. He
bought
the car at that price, and I have since heard that he is very happy with 
it.

As another example, I passed on a 951S for $9950, inasmuch as several 
questions about the integrity of the seller came into question. Given a car
with better records and a seller I could trust, I would easily spend 
$12000 for the same car.

So, supply and demand do set a price, but that price is often only a starting
point for negotiations for a particular vehicle and a particular seller and 
a particular buyer...

I should have paid more attention in Economics Class...


Good Luck!
