Word up!  I'm glad that my 951's steering wheel doesn't have an airbag too!
There aren't that many car manufacturers who can tastefully integrate
airbags into an aesthetically pleasing steering wheel design anyway.
Mercedes and BMW have come up with some nice designs, but everything else
seems limited to an ugly, chunky rectangular shoe box within a 4-spoked
wheel.  While my present steering wheel can also be abtractly reduced to a
rectangle with 4 spokes, it's not as chunky and has some nice horizontal
lines to it.  I think it's a much more elegant design than the one provided
for airbag-equipped 944's, which has a forced look to it and appears as if
the word "PORSCHE" is about to crack and bust open a can of whoop-a$$ in
your face at any moment.  Plus, most airbag-eqipped steering wheels have
tiny horn buttons located near the perimeter or spokes of the steering wheel
that I think are impractical to use when that 18-wheeler is drifting into
your lane.  I can't think of many other steering wheels that offer the
amount of instrument visibility that mine does either.  Until airbag
assemblies become more compact and unobtrusive, I think they will generally
be plagued with lame steering wheel designs.  Oh, it may sound like I care
more about the appearance of my steering wheel than I do for the appearance
of my face after an accident, but can't designers come up with better
looking wheels?  I mean, we have to look at those things every time we sit
in the driver's seat!  I don't want all those cruise-control, stereo volume,
and gear shifting buttons if I have to have them on an ugly steering wheel!
