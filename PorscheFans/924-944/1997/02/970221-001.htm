I just read the post about reducing car weight at road speeds.  It seems
like a few pounds of added weight to the wheel and tires can really make a
difference when manipulated by those warp multiplication factors for
acceleration, etc.  I have recently bothered everyone about whether or not I
should widen my 205/225's to 225/245's, and all replies have encouraged me
to go ahead with the up-sizing.  Now I realize that a few mm more rubber
width (and the air added within) isn't much added weight.  But if you apply
those multiplication factors to those small figures, will the resulting
weight be enough to cancel any benefits I may receive by up-sizing the
tires?  Will acceleration suffer while cornering grip increases?
        I am probably just making a big thing out of nothing.  But I just
may have a change of heart if I learn that the added mass will make a
noticeable negative difference.  I was hoping I won't be sacrificing much by
going wider.  So what is it folks?  I know that more rubber = more grip =
Good.  But does more rubber = more (significant) weight = Bad?  Thanks in
advance for any help or replies telling me to stop worrying about a few
silly pounds.
