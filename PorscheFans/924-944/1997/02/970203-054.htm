Thanks to all who responded to my request for info re: tires for my 
944S2 cabriolet.  I made the plunge for new new wheels and tires and 
want to relay what I found out for those other fortunate individuals 
who also have a 944 cabriolet.  I replaced the stock 16" forged dish 
wheels and Michelin XGTV4 tires (205/55 front & 225/50 rear)with 16" 993 
wheels and Bridgstone SO1 Expedia tires (205/50 F & 245/45 R).  The ride 
quality and handling both improved dramatically (the Michelin tires are 
too hard for the convertible causing both a rough ride and an unsure 
road feel.  The 993 wheels also look a lot better than the dish wheels.
Although the chassis flex was reduced, I still was not satisfied and 
installed a Cambermeister which ties the front shock towers together.
Although designed to maintain the camber in hard cornering, I figured 
that it has to work to keep the front of the body from flexing.  It did, 
in fact reduce the flex significantly and the car is an abloute joy to 
drive.  If any of you cabriolet owners out there have experienced some 
body flex and want to get rid of it, for about $189 the Cambermeister is 
the answer.  It takes about 1/2 hour to install and bolts directly on 
top of the shock towers.
