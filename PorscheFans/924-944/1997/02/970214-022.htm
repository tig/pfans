Continued from previous message . . .

Then, we decided to have a bit more fun.  You may get upset when you read
this, but we had to do it, it was too tempting.  With all these boost bolts
staring at us in the face, we couldn't resist.  We stuck in the 2.7 chip
which seems to run the richest and started to play with the boost.  The
service manager was driving and I was the eagle eye on the boost gauge.
I would read the numbers out to him as he accelerated and when we hit a
set number, he would let off.  First run, we decided to try and run 17psi.
1st gear, no traction (this is pretty normal in my car when it's cold), 2nd
gear, no traction until midway through 2nd (my car usually has no traction
problems in second), 3rd gear, full traction.  The thing pulled like a tank.
We were making some serious speed.  There was no pinging because the boost
does drop at high rpms.  Next run, we tried a very restrictive boost bolt,
1st gear, 12.5psi, no traction, 2nd gear 17psi, no traction, 3rd gear 20psi,
partial traction.  This was so wickedly fast that it scared the crap out of
me.  The car would start to spin its tires in 3rd gear at 150km/h when it
went over expansion beams on the bridge!  Going across the bridge sounded
like this wooooooo-WAAAAA-wooooooo-WAAAAAA-woooooo.  The "wo" is traction,
the "WA" is no traction when we went over the expansion beams.  We did
this for only one run.  Again no detonation because the boost tails off
at the top end.  Well, we had to do it because my curiousity would have
killed me if I wouldn't have.  All I've got to say is, it's freakin' fast
at 20psi.

After all that, I kept the 2.7 chips in there to try for a few days.  I
didn't like the linear response, it was like driving a japanese car all
over again.  I also didn't like the 7200rpm rev limiter kick in, it feels
too high for the turbo on the car.  Sure, if you have a K27-8, 7200 makes
sense, but for someone like me that likes to use the rev limiter to let the
car catch up to the spinning tires, it's too high.  I prefer the turbo
cup's 6800rpm rev limiter.  Fuel economy was down quite a bit with the APE
chips too, but then who cares about that anyways.  I kept waiting for that
surge when I drove with the 2.7 and it never came, just one fluid 
acceleration run.  I ended up putting back my Turbo Cup computers and am
very happy with them.  Their mapping also for some reason comes on boost
harder in the next gear.  To eliviate the lean surging at part throttle,
I've temporarily disconnected the O2 sensor to see if that eliminates it
without affecting gas economy too badly.  If the car runs really rich,
I'll re-connect the O2 sensor for fear of clogging the cat with rich soot.

Well, that was about it.  We had a blast and my car is back home all safe
and sound.  Paul picked up his 89 944T yesterday.  It has some interesting
things on it.  The brakes have a very well made air system that takes the
air from the factory intakes and then pipes it through a hose and dumps it
into the center of the rotor.  It's not the usual vent like my car has, but
a race type of cooling hose, etc.  It's really well made and attached
very nicely.  I think it might be that cool brake kit people talk about all
the time.  His car has the early APE chips (this is where we sourced that
from).  This likely means the car was probably tracked on occasion, but
that's fine with us.  The shifting seems to also have a very mild short
shift kit because third and fifth are further left than mine and the throws
feel more direct and shorter.

We are all heading down to Bremerton for the autocross on Sunday.  The
people running the event are going to accomodate us by building a very
open flowing course so turbo lag is not hindering our progress, very
nice people they are.  So far, we have the following going down:

Farzaan Kassam        89 944T         Burnaby, B.C.
Paul Buchmann         89 944T         Burnaby, B.C.
Darren Foo            87 944T         Vancouver, B.C.
Lu                    89 944T         Burnaby, B.C.
Tim Stark             88 944T(S)      Vancouver, B.C.

As well as those, we are meeting another 4-5 Talon owners down in Seattle
to make the remainder of the trek.  If you are in the Bremerton area, stop
by on Sunday and come as a passenger in our runs.

I've borrowed Tim Stark's "hard-as-rock" R1 race tires because my Hoosiers
haven't come in yet.  Any recommendations or hints on these tires for
pressures, feel, etc.  I've run on RSII yokes, Hoosier and GSC-S, but never
an R1.  Any hints would be greatly appreciated.

Farzaan.
89 951 - 14psi.
