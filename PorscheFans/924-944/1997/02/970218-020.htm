Kevin:
My 88 TS gave me the same symptoms intermittently over several months
recently.  The problem was diagnosed as master cylinder, but, while
the car was in the shop for that my tech noticed that the left rear
wheel was askew and wobbled when the wheel/tire was firmly shaken. 
Turned out the outer rear bearing had fractured.  Hard to imagine
when you see how beefy it is. Seems the associated wheel wobble
caused the ABS sensors to give me a dashboard display.  Maybe that is
something you can focus on?  I'd check all four wheels off the
ground, grab the wheel at 9 and 3 o'clock and give a firm shake. 
Since the bearing replacement, I've had normal brake function on the
street.

My car is bone stock, only has 37,000 miles on it, it sits around a
lot, does some spring, summer fall daily driving and goes to 2-3
track events a year.  I do maintain it by the book, and have had a
great time with it at Mid-Ohio, Putnam Park and Road America. 
Currently waiting for motor mounts and thermofan switch replacement. 
As a lurker since December, I've enjoyed the enthusiasm of the list
members.  Happy motoring all!
