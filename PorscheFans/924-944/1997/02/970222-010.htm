Douglas,

Someone else just notified me of this seal, too. My water pump was bought
new from Porsche and the all the rings and seals were listed on the
invoice along with the new t-stat. Still, that doesn't mean it got onto
the car...When the car goes in on Wednesday for the shocks, I'll ask about
this seal and see if they know what I'm talking about. Thanks for the
advice! These cars are a real bear at times, huh?
