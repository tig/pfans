Hello,

> Why is the dealer $125 for rotors, Automotion and Performance at $120 and

It's simply a matter of profit. I'm not sure who gets the profit,
but it isn't you. When you inquire about parts prices, make sure you
ask who manufactures the parts. For example, those brake rotors you
are asking about should be made by Zimmerman. Those are OEM parts.
Zimmerman rotors are the same, wether you get them from the local
dealer, or a discount mail order place.

The dealer has to pay Porsche for the parts. Porsche charges more,


so the dealer charges more. Automotion and Performance Products have 
to pay for the nice catalog. Vertex (and Zims, Imparts, NOPI, etc)
doesn't have a fancy catalog, and orders parts from Zimmerman, etc.
So the savings gets passed along to you.

Did I tell you my CV Boot story? I needed a boot for my 89 turbo. I called
the local dealer. He didn't have it in stock, but could order it for me
for only $94. I called another dealer. He didn't have it either, but
could get it for only $89. I then called Imparts. They had it in stock,
and it was $18 + shipping, so I ordered it. I then had to stop by a 
local service place because I needed some special bolts he had. The
owner asked me if I needed a CV Boot. I told him yes, I did. He had it
in stock, for $19. It turns out the dealer called him looking for a boot!

> As for pads, are the $25 metal masters fine?  The OEM's are $75.  That's a

The pads are different. The Repco / Axxis Metal Masters (IMHO) stop better,
and create less dust. The factory pads probably last longer, and might
work better cold. I vastly prefer the Repco pads. 

Good luck,
