Luck has it that I still have the empty can, since the recyclers refused 
to take it.  The product is Berryman B-12 Chemtool.  The company name is 
Berryman Products, Inc.  Arlington, TX 76011. Toll free in the US: 
1-800-433-1704.  Should be able to find it anywhere, don't know about 
overseas.  Others should work well, that are a well known name brand and 
claim to 'disperse moisture in fuel systems' or similar wording.

The Chevron Techroline fuel injector cleaner mentioned previously does 
not claim to remove moisture from fuel systems, if I am not mistaken.

Sta-bil is a completely different product.  This is a fuel preservative
that is added to gas (petrol) that will be stored for a long period, such
as a Porsche over the winter.  This product prevents the gas from breaking
down and forming nasty varnish deposits everywhere, and keeps it fresh. 
As a side note, if you have a stored vehicle that will not start, drain
the fuel and start with new.  I fixed my father's non-starting lawn mower
that way. 

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.
