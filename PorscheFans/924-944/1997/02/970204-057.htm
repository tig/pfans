	Marty,

	It sounds like a great car. Congrats on finding one. That's
	sometimes hard to do. By now, you already know this is a 
	pretty fast car. What you may not realize is how fast it already
	is. I've heard of many occaisions of 951 owners flooring it to
	get on the freeway only to find out they're entering traffic
	at about 110 mph. That said, you might consider spending your
	money on some good performance tires and as much track time as
	you can get. That's probably the smartest thing you could do
	at this point.

	About the chips, the chip goes into the DME which is located
	under the passenger-side footwell (under the carpet).The chips
	can give you an increase in hp but at the cost of the longevity
	of your engine. Running under increased boost can cause things
	like blown head gaskets, etc. If I were you, I wouldn't do
	it. There are no cheap, easy ways to increase hp on this engine.
	Good luck!

  Hi all,

  I raised the trunk carpet this week in my 86' 944 and got a two
  gallon surprise.  Yes, there was almost two gallons of frozen
  water (ice) around my spare wheel.  The spaces at the sides (by
  the rear fenders) were both dry.

  All the carpets in the trunk were dry.  Any ideas where this
  water could be entering (rear hatch ?, rear lights?...).

  TIA

  David, 86' 944, 70k km.
