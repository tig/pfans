Hi Nick,

In some respects he is right, but the waste is in the cost of the added
horsepower to dollars ratio.  Purchasing a new/used DME box and the cost of
the performance chip is a lot of money for a FEW extra horsepower.  The
only difference I know between that DME and its later brethren is the ROM
chip is socketed in the post 1985.5 cars.  The earlier cars required the
chip to be desoldered.  For that matter, I have the machine to do the job,
but most want excessive fees to do what is essentially a 15 minute job.
Furthermore, if the selling agent does not have the equipment, then I can
see his argument, he would be forced to send it to some rework house at
additional cost.  My machine cost me $1500.00 (I had an electronic service
business at one time) and for the amount of pre 85.5 cars this company
sees, he probably can not justify the cost and liabilities with unskilled
technicians (it takes some skill to do the job and not butcher the PCB
(Printed Circuit Board (and I like nested parenthesis))).  You can use
cheaper equipment to do the work, but the point is it does take some
finesse and experience.

All that behind us, another bummer is that all this only gives you about 15
horsepower gain.  That is something you will not notice when driving.  Even
modifying the exhaust will not up the power much more.  I have heard of
racing efforts that have extracted more ponies out of the car, but for the
cost of the engine work you could buy a Turbo.

If you want some seat of the pants excitement, I would really recommend the
Welmeister throttle cam for about $30.00.  I just put one in my 944 and it
is a blast.  The cam fools you into thinking that the car has more reserve
power than it really does, but the end result is really fun.  Do it, what
have you to loose?

Lastly, I have a 944S that I bought that has about 40 more horses than my
944.  That car does not seem too much faster than the 944.  It is better,
but not significantly so.  In my search for more power, I have given in and
bought a Turbo.  The difference is astounding.  Ahhhh.  Prices on Turbos
are never better.  If your car is in good shape, the Kelly Blue Book claims
a resale of over $5,000.  Resale values for the 86 Turbo is under $8,800.
I have seen them for less.
