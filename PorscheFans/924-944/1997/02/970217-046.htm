Hi All,

I just joined the list as I'm considering purchasing a 968.  I'm a long time
sports car enthusiast, but this would be my first Porsche so I figured I'd
turn to the experts for advice.  968's are pretty hard to find around here,
but I've found a '92 Coupe with an asking price of $24.9K.  It has 43.2K
miles, and the only option I know it has for sure is the 17 inch wheels.  A
few questions:

 - Is this a reasonable price?  Too high?  Incredible bargain?

 - Is there anything in particular I should be on the lookout for in a used 968?

 - Are there any problems with the '92 model year?  Should I try to find a
more recent model?

Any answers/recommendations or words of wisdom conderning any aspect of
968's would be greatly apreciated.  I appologize of this has been recently
discussed or is a FAQ subject somewhere.  If so a web address or a list
archive date is all I need.

Thanks!!
