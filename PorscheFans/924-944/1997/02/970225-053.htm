Hi, Porschefans,

In the February issue of Car and Driver magazine, Patrick Bedard writes,

"A Colorado reader writes that his wife is 4 feet 11.  He wants the airbags disabled in 
his next new car.  Dealers say they can't do that; it's illegal.  That's the law, NHTSA 
chief counsel Sam Dubbin confirmed, but he told the reader it was okay to risk injury 
trying to do it himself."

Apparently, dealers can't, owners can.
