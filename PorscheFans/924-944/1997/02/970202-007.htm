I fixed a couple problems yesterday with my 87 944S (DME-controlled with
68K) and thought someone may have the same issues. It had noticeable flat
spots in the power band at roughly 2800, 4000, and 5200 rpms which I was
trying to fix and, just recently, started to have a weak/surging idle when
the engine was cold.

To fix ANOTHER problem, I already had replaced the old cap, rotor, wires,
and plugs--and those fixes didn't help the surging idle, flat spots.
Anyway, the Throttle Position Sensor (or in Porsche's case, Throttle
Position Switch) was the culprit with the flat spots and lousy cold idle.
Until the cold idle went south, I thought the flat spots were fuel system
related.

The job is best performed on the lift from underneath with the S car (16V
head with the TPS located in the rear lower portion of the intake
manifold-"You've got to be kidding!"), and one bonus IF YOU HAVE DME (check
back of owner's manual if you don't know) on the S is that idle speed,
mixture, and timing are computer-controlled and don't need to be touched.

The TPSwitch is $55 dollars at cost, and retail is about $90. NA 944s and
8V Turbos should have the TPS on the front top of the engine so it is MUCH
easier to replace. If your car has a driveability problem linked to RPM or
when in cold running condition, I'd do the TPS before I'd do other basic
things like removing and cleaning the injectors. Bad TPSs don't always
cause the car to be undriveable. My other performance cars used up TPSs on
a regular basis--I'm not sure why I didn't think of it sooner on this one!

Hope this helps!
