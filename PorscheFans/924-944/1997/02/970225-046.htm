The gentleman from Norway spoke of dying happy in a Porsche.  I have two
additional cents for this thread.  Awhile back I spent two years 
restoring a 1978 924 (please don't laugh at me too hard; it was my first 
Porsche and my emotional investment always took priority over my dollar 
investment).  I'm poor, so the only way to pull this off was through 
lots of regular visits to a salvage yard.  I am blessed to have a very 
good one only 50 minutes drive away.
These trips turned into much more than a scavenger hunt as I had the 
privilege to study the deaths of Porsches, Volvos, Mercedes, Saabs, 
Jaguars, as well as Nissans, Hondas, Volkswagons, and Toyotas - the 
brands housed at this particular branch of the salvage company.  
Frankly, I was amazed at how well Porsche compared to Volvo, Mercedes, & 
Saab.  In perhaps 90 percent of these wrecks, one could climb inside 
and, from this perspective, the signs of an accident were literally 
trivial.  Only in the most extreme circumstances did I ever see evidence 
of some penetration of the cabin.
The econo-boxes were a totally different story.  I once saw a Jetta 
nearly shorn in half after being hit T-bone fashion by a motorcycle.  
I'm no medical examiner but, it appeared the driver had been killed by 
the passenger's seat...with a passenger in it at the time.  
Anyway, my point being that our steel bodies can't be over-valued when, 
by contrast, my Nissan Sentra might get me killed just coming in to the 
curb at 7-11 a little too quick.
