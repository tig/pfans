<< I just purchased a used set of yellow Koni sport shocks (front struts and
 rear shocks, M474 option). It says adjustable on the body, but I don't know
 how to adjust them. The struts do not have the dial selector on top. Can
 anyone enlighten me?
 
 I also got springs with the shocks. They have two yellow dots on them. I
 think they are slighly stiffer than than the stock springs in my 86 turbo,
 about 175#. Should I use them or go to a stiffer 220# spring?
 
 Lastly, if I install the sport shocks and struts, and the two dot coils,
 without changing the stabilizer bars or the rear torsion bars, will I end up
 with an evil handling car?
  >>

I put the yellow Koni's on my 85.5 with 250# front springs (small diameter,
as
Doug D said in his response).  I left the torsion bars stock.  As Doug
pointed out, all other things being equal, that would increase understeer.
However, at the same time, I put on Weltmeister adjustable sway-bars.
They allow plenty of flexibility to retune the balance (they weigh a TON,
though!).
Start with the rear bar at full stiff and the front at midrange, then adjust
from 
there.  I wouldn't  go beyond 250# in the front w/out heavier torsion bars.
Have fun.
