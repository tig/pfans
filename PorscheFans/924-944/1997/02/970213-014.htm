I have a 1983 944 purchased new with 220,000 miles

I serviced the beast myself almost forever it seems.

the water problem in the rear seat footwell was a problem I went through for
months.  But alas EVERYONE with this problem I have SOLVED IT!

You will probably notice, (now that I am about to mention it), that it DOESNT
matter if you parked uphill, downhill, sunroof loose, gasket not just right,
etc.

What does matter though is IF you drove in the rain.

What is happening...is this...

There is a small crack or hole in the floor pan of the compartment that is
getting wet.  By compartment I mean left side or right side of the entire
passanger compartment.  My leak was a small hairline crack in the FRONT right
passanger compartment.  This TINY crack caused towels and towels of water to
be mopped out.  I hated it.  I had a shop incand. light burning all night
under the carpet to dry the car out during the winter months.  Every morning
I awoke fearful and HOPING that my garage had burned down.  But no, Porsche
used materials in the carpet and sound deading material that never caught
fire, no matter how hot my light got.

Anyway, take out the seat, pull back the carpet, and shine a strong light
under the floorpan IN THE DARK.  The crack will allow the light to shine
through.  Look very carefully, because even a VERY TINY crack will cause
immense flooding.  

I then used some 3M silicone caulk to seal the crack.  And IT WORKED.  I
drove through many a rainstrorm and NO more leaks.

PS-  I  Absolutely love this car.  It has been the most reliable, most fun to
drive, car I ever owned.  Its going on 14 years of FUN.
