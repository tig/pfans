Hi again,

Let me put some forth some more info.  Since I've had the car there always has
been a small trail of smoke coming from the car under full acceleration.  There
are no external oil leaks (I checked this winter), and there is no coolant/oil
mixing.

The car has an Andial 2.8 liter, conversion with test pipe, K-27 turbo, Stage
II chips.

So either oil is leaking from the turbo, into the exhaust (hmmm, hopefully not
into the intake).  Or residual oil is being burnt off the cylinder walls, and
the pistons go down.  Or oil is getting past the pistons into the combustion
chamber.  Am I missing some places?

What I want to know, is this normal for these cars?  The engine was rebuilt
under 5000 miles ago.
