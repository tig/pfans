Can someone help with a question about seats? I have a 944 Turbo.  I drive
it on the street around town and long commutes to the track, up to 1,000
miles round-trip.

I'd like to get a seat which offers more lateral support than the stock
non-sport seats yet still provides reasonable comfort and ease of use for
the driver and passenger during the track commute and other pleasure
driving.

Am I correct in thinking that race seats are not going to be good in this
situation? My track season is long (January-November) and I'm short on time
so swapping them in and out isn't an option.

And if the above is true would something like a Recaro or Flofit sport seat
be a better solution? Has anyone used these? Or would I be better of
finding a set of used factory sport seats?

Thanks in advance for any and all replies,

Doug Donsbach
