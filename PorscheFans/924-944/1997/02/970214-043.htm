My '89 normally aspirated 944 runs fine, but it has exhibited the
following symption since I obtained it second hand (15 months ago).
I am trying to determine if this is a normal characteristic or if it
can be fixed. 

Whether the engine is hot or cold, it takes the engine several revolutions 
or about two seconds to start.  It is as if fuel pressure has to build 
before the engine will fire.  Do I have a fuel system that is not holding 
pressure between starts?

Other cars I've owned (VW) started instantly - usually the first turn or 
so of the crankshaft - but those were CIS cars.

If anyone could let me know how quickly their cars start, or if there is 
a fix, or 'live with it,' I would like to hear from you.

Thanks,

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.
