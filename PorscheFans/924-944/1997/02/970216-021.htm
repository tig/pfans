968's are great cars. They are better at most everything then the 88 or 89
Turbo's. The Turbo has a slight edge in high speed power but certainly not at
lower speeds. Problem is that there are very few of them around. Can't

.. There are many more Turbo's available, at least on the East Coast of the
USA. They are certainly wonderful cars. I bet that there were very few
imported, much less than the 944 Turbo's.
