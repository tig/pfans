Clark,

If you do apply some sort of pressure (blowing), apply it without removing the
banjo bolt from the line itself.  The line is of a hard plastic that is heat
hardened.  You won't be able to get the line back onto the banjo bolt.  Simply
unscrew the 13mm (I think) bolt that holds the two banjo bolts onto the
manifold.  Be very careful not to drop anything.  Anything you drop in this
area could fall into the clutch housing inspection hole.  Anything you drop,
retrieve with some sort of magnet...

When you replace the banjo bolt, don't overtighten the 13mm bolt.  Just snug it
up.

I don't really know if it holds pressure or not.  From looking at the
attachment inside the KLR box it probably should.


Good luck!
