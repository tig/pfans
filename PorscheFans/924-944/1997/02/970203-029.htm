Dear Kevin,

I am sorry that you have to make the same decision as I had a few months
ago.  This is indeed one of the toughest.  The car you have is exactly the
same model & year as mine.  In 1995, I spent just over C$4k on the car and
when the water pump broke in November 1995 which necessitated an investment
of C$800, I was so frustrated that I was to sell it at any price.  I
started to search for an alternative sport car, the options I had in mind
were: Nissan 300ZX (90), RX-7 Turbo II (89), VW Corrado G60 (90), Toyoto
Celica GTS Turbo 4WD (90).  They all have their strengths and weaknesses
but all require an initial investment of at least C$5k on the top of what I
think I can get from selling my 944.  Having talked to my mechanic who is a
sincere German, I decided to stick to my 944.

To sell or not really depends on what repairs have been done to your car,
you of course know that water pump, engine gaskets, gear box (2nd gear),
timing belts are the usual problems of 944 (84).  If, like me, you happen
to have fixed them all.  I would say you are safe for at least a good
number of years provided of course you take good care of it.  In my case,
my car braved the extremely cold and snowy Alberta winter and had no
problem since November.  I have had my car repainted with the original
guard red and can tell you that none of the above mentioned alternative
sport cars can give the same glory and pride as a 944 with its shiny new
paint.  Also, apart from Corrado, those alternative car owners are not as
close together and well-organized, at least on the net, as that of Porsche.

Blessing from across the border.
