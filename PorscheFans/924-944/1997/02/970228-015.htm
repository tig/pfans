I wish I could.  In case anyone is interested in blacklisting my
dealership, it's "Father's and Son's" (not totally sure about the
placement of the apostrophes).

Yeah, that's what I thought, too.  "Well, hey.  I can probably buy one of
those luggage compartment covers from the dealer, since nobody else seems
to be selling them."  Hah.  He quoted me $850 (but at least told me to sit
down first).

The guys at F&S are generally just clueless about cars.  You can really
tell that they're more a VW/Audi dealership than a Porsche one.  They keep
two 911s, both of which are really pretty, in their storeroom, but with
such a massive markup that I doubt they'll be able to sell any.

F&S, when they remember to place your order, are fairly prompt.  Only
about two days, a week for the hardest parts to find.  However, when we
were waiting for them to service our other car (a little more on this
later), they just forgot to order the part, so we went for about two weeks
without a second car before we had it towed to a private dealer (and had
to pay for the maintenance ourselves, since only F&S was authorized to do
warranty work).

Really?  Well, let me give you this comparison.  F&S is selling heater
cores for all water-cooled Porsches for right around $350.  A used one
costs $100; a new one, not from the dealer, costs $110.  Assuming marginal
profit on the $110-part, that still could be as much as a 350% markup.

Well, guess what?  F&S is the only authorized Porsche dealer in Western
Massachusetts.  The nearest other one is in (I believe) Boston, or
possibly deep-south Connecticut.  They've got new Porsche owners by the
short and curlies, so to speak.  Thank God I have a mechanic who knows his
ass from a hole in the ground and is honest besides.

That's true, but it ain't worth $250, even with five hours' worth of labor
to replace the heater core.

The great thing about F&S is that they suck.  Everyone knows it, but
no other shops are willing to service German cars.  F&S has a stranglehold
on W. MA German automobiles.  However, their quality isn't up to dealing
with this monopoly by a long shot.  In fact, shortly after "working" on
our non-Porsche, F&S failed the BMW recertification exam, forcing us to
drive way the hell down to Hartford to get our car serviced.  Their
service is abominable, their pricing unbelievable, the waits unbearable.
If someone gave me $80K and told me to go buy a 911 cabriolet, but that I
could only do it at F&S, I'd come damn close to giving them back their
money.  (I wouldn't, but even being close...)

It could just be the area.  I know that a friend of mine has had terrible
problems with a local Pontiac dealership (who charges in the neighborhood
of $100/hour for labor), and another has never really been able to get his
car to run very well after taking it to a certain Honda dealer.

Although I'm sure there are honest, hard-working, well-qualified dealers
out there, I sure haven't seen them.  You have to fight every step of the
way to get them to fix anything, and they treat you like a total moron.
It just isn't worth it.

Well, there's my $0.20.
