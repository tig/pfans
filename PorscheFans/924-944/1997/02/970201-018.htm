        While reading the first few digests that I have received, I realized
that my 1986 944 Turbo (Guards Red/Black with 60,000 miles)) was exhibiting
the symptoms of problems already discussed in PorscheFan correspondence.  I
was wondering if anyone would be willing to advise me on some of these
problems, as well as on a few of my car's own idiosyncrasies:
        First, I read about "the loud groaning noise" being a tell-tale sign
of power-steering trauma.  I noticed this "groaning" sound this past
December whenever I was backing out of my driveway on cold mornings.  It
surprised me at first because I had never heard this kind of creaking
before, but since the sound always disappears before I even clear the
mailbox, I attributed it to effects of the cold (mild/freezing
Northern-Virginia winter weather).  I am also a college student, and I leave
the car covered outside at home while I'm away at school (Georgia Tech).
While my dad drives it once a week, I figure that little creaking sounds are
to be expected when I start the baby up for the first few times between
semesters.  So are these steering noises indicators of more than just little
and intermittent driving use?  I haven't noticed leaks of any sorts from my
car, and the power-steering fluid level is normal.
        Second, my car has a sticky valve lifter that only rears its ugly
head (or at least its annoying clicking) after I reach the 3,000 mile
interval for an oil change.  I've always used Mobil 1 15W-50 synthetic, and
after I change the oil, the lifter noise disappears for another 3,000 miles.
I know that Mobil 1 is supposed to be good for 6,000 miles, and I would
change the oil every 3,000 anyway, but the remarkably accurate and audible
reminder is a nuisance.  Oil additives (in between oil changes when the
noise returns) usually get rid of the clicking sounds temporarily until I
find time to change the oil myself- usually by 3,040 miles.  In any case,
I've had the problem diagnosed (at Autothority and AutoSport Systems Group
in VA) and the exact lifter located.  My friends there said that the
clicking obviously represent damage that's occurring with every stroke, but
immediate attention was not necessary since I was able to free the lifter by
changing the oil.  However, they recommended that I have it looked at soon
because it's eventually (most likely) going to collapse.  Are there any
recommendations, suggestions, or horror stories that might motivate me to
have it fixed when I have the car serviced this summer?
        Lastly, I've noticed irregular RPM spikes while waiting at stop
lights. The RPM's slowly climb to around 2,000, hover there for a few
seconds, and then return to the normal idle rpm.  Besides an Autothority
Stage II chip, there are no other modifications to the engine or its
management system.  I was told this was a harmless oxygen sensor/leak
problem that was fairly common with 944 turbo's, and that it can be
temporarily fixed with an expensive replacement part from the factory that
will go bad in a few years again.  But it still makes for an awkward
situation every time I have to get my VA emissions inspection done. I was
wondering if anyone knows how I could control or fix this problem easily and
permanently, and if I am wrong about it's harmlessness (besides the extra
fuel consumption).         
        So far, I have enjoyed reading PorscheFan mail, and I am impressed
with the depth of knowledge and the comaraderie of individuals who may only
have one thing in common: the passion (and sometimes frustration) associated
with owning a Porsche.  This 951 is my second Porsche- my first Porsche was
a sable (looks like bronze) '83 944 that also happened to be the first car I
ever owned and learned to drive stick on.  I hope some of you will recognize
my problems and won't mind (re)sharing your advice with a new member.  I'd
also appreciate any tire recommendations for an "enthusiastic" driver in
Northern Virginia. Thanks.
