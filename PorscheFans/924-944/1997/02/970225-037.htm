Erza,

	Setting 944 bearings is real easy, the feel you are looking for 
is that the washer just moves, it can not spin, as you detected, but it 
will slide side to side. My rule of thum is tighten, spin wheel, check 
for some movment of washer by pushing on it with a BIG screwdriver blade, 
when it is TOO tight it will not move. 

Haynes inplies the washer will spin, it won't.
