To the gang,

	Since we are now onto the "crunch test" stories I thought I would
through mine in.

	Back in '80 the Porsche dealership in my town was owned by this old
guy by the name of John Sadler. He was a neat guy, at the time was
70 but acted 17. John was driving his dealerships SC down a 2 lane
county road when he came upon a tractor pulling a hay wagon coming
the other way. As he was about 50 yards from the tractor a 60's
something pontiac bonneville (a massive tank) pulls out from behind
the wagon and proceeds to hit him head on. John had slowed down to
about 35 prior to impact, the other car was doing about the same
according to him. The 911's front drivers fender was sheared off, the
front suspension and wheel was placed under the drivers door. Back
drivers side suspension was sheared off. Drivers door pushed in
around 6 inches. Car then went off the road and hit a tree head on.
After the car stopped its excersion John crawled out of the 
passengers side door. Not a scratch or cut on him, only a couple of bruses
later.

	I will always remember seeing John's car in his shop prior to being
hauled out for salvage. Left side gone. floor pan bent, engine case
cracked via transmission being shoved around. And yet the entire
cabin area was safe and only *slightly* alterd and John had calmly
walked away. Made me think of our cars in a whole new light.

	The poor girl that hit him was only 16 and had just gotten her
license about 2 weeks before. She managed to take out a car that in
most likelyhood, considering the area this took place in, cost about
the same, or more, than her house.

	I do not feel all that much safer driving my volvo as compared to my 
porsche.

take care
