Hey guys and girls :)

I need some help.  I'm having a problem starting my car.  You turn the key
and the dash lights turn on and you hear one click, then it does nothing.
If you hold the key in the starter position, after about 4-5 seconds, the
starter will start and the car turns on.  If you don't hold it at the start
position and release it and try again, it starts right up.

I've ruled out the start because when it's cranking, it starts fine.  I
was thinking more on the lines of a sticky relay or something, but I
couldn't find a starter relay.  I tried pulling the ignition relays and DME
relay to get the samer result, but couldn't duplicate it using that method.

Any help would be appreciated.  It seems to do it more when the car is left
for a while.  Perhaps a bad battery?  Does the car know when the voltage is
too low to try and start?

Farzaan.
89 951.
