Hello, 
 
I will be installing a stereo in my 944 this weekend and have realized that I 
must remove the rear-side windows to get the rear speaker panels out.  My shop 
manuals are on order.  Can someone explain the procedure for removing those 
windows? 
 
Also, I've looked the car over quite a bit and have realized that you can't 
put 6X9s anywhere very easily which means it's going to be pretty hard to get 
any base out of my system:  If anyone has any suggestions on the following I 
would appreciate it: 
 
- What's the best kind of speakers to put in the back seat section of the car? 
 
- Does any company make some type of pre-molded fitting in which you could put 
6X9s in the rear storage pockets?  Any other suggestions for getting solid 
base without resorting to putting base tubes or speaker boxes in the rear? 
 
- What other suggestions might you have.  I'm pretty open at this point. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Eric
