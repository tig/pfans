Looks like I am going to have the radiator off tomorrow so here goes:  

1.My cooling system has never had problems. In 110F weather with the A/C
on, the temp never exceeds the first mark. The cooling fans have nevercome
on in stages though. The temp rises to barely normal (first mark) and then
both fans turn on with gale-force air and sound effects but rarely stay on
for more than 3-4 minutes at which point the temp sinks almost to the edge
of the lowest (40F) solid block on the gauge. Both fans also turn on with
the A/C. The only time I have seen one fan working is when I turn the
motor off and the car is still hot (the right fan, facing the engine). My
question is, is there anything wrong with this setup -- I know the fans
are supposed to come on one at a time (and maybe varying speeds?) but
since this gets the job done very well does it make sense to mess with it?
I would rather risk burning out a fan motor than have to constantly worry
about overheating. What is the normal fan on-off cycle with the lower
temp. thermoswitch? 

2. Are the fans _supposed_ to wake the dead?? These are LOUD fans. I can't
tell if one is louder than the other, but I am wondering if there is any
way to lubricate them, check bearings?

3. Any other routine maintenance/diagnostics possible with the radiator
and fans off? TIA.
