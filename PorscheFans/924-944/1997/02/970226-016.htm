Hey, I'll jump on the bandwagon, too.

Once, my mother (no laughing!) was driving my car up an incline during
winter.  She put in the clutch, shifted into third, and (since my mother
isn't exactly the smoothest driver out there) let the clutch out without
giving any real gas to the car.  Although it's OK most of the time, we had
the misfortune to be on top of a patch of mostly ice and slush.  (We would
have had the "accident" anyway, in all likelihood.)

The car slid sideways and spun once.  We ended facing the hill on
the other side of the road as we coasted towards it at about 35mph.  Since
we were on ice the whole way, the brakes did crap; we hit at a pretty good
speed.  The front valence was crumpled, the radiator knocked off, but
there was no other engine damage.

Then my mother (do you notice a trend here?) was driving the car up to a
stoplight, not paying attention, when she noticed that, not only was the
light red, there was a car stopped at it.  Realizing that she couldn't
stop in time (I've got to admit she handles an emergency pretty well), she
went over the curb, getting actual air off it, and came down on someone's
lawn.  Finished off the front valence and snapped a clip on the exhaust,
but no other damage, despite having hit a really high curb.

Last story, I promise: my mother was driving along when this massive car
pulled out right in front of her and stopped, blocking the entire lane.
So she pulled into the other lane and managed to get back before the car
which was occupying that lane made it.  The whole display lit up with red
lights, but the car didn't even shudder.

Showing that sometimes it's possible to prevent accidents in a Porsche
that you'd otherwise just have to survive in a different car.
