Well, my car hasn't been stolen or broken into yet. :)

The factory alarm system on my car (89 944 T) is passive.  It is turned on
everytime you lock the door.  Basically it prevents someone from stealing your
car.  I don't think it prevents someone from breaking in (i.e. breaking
windows).  If someone forces one of the doors open, then it'll go off.  If you
leave the car locked, windows down, and somebody pulls the lock knob up (i.e.
unlocks the door without key) and opens the door, it'll go off.  Or if someone
tries to start it without a key, it'll go off.

The nice thing about the alarm is that it has red leds in the lock knobs that
blink when the alarm is on (hopefully a theft deterent).
