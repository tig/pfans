hey Terry and other P-folks,

FWIW I had a similar problem with my 84 944.  It turned out to be a snapped
cable under the dashboard of my car.

The local Porsche Service Centre quoted me $450.00 to fix the problem without
even looking at it and then said they couldn't fit my car in till another
three weeks (unbearable in the middle of summer...).   The mechanic I
eventually took it to (services European cars)  was able to diagnose the
problem and fix it for less then $75.00.

This was truly a life saver as NOT only was the heater on all the time (and
overpowering the A/C)  but the car is Black on Black...

I hope your problem is as "easy" to fix...
