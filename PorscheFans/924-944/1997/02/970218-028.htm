I have had a set of SP8000s, but not on my Porsche.  I had
size 195/50ZR15 on 15x7 wheels.  The tires were extremely
grippy for cornering but seemed to be lacking in off the
line acceleration.  Of course, I don't do dump clutches
any more (or ever in my Porsche), so this wouldn't really matter.
I found the SP8000s to be acceptable in the rain without too
much hydroplaning.

The D40M2s are not such extreme performance tires and should 
last longer than the SP8000s.  Also, they seem to squeal more.
This can be a GOOD THING as the SP8000s tended to grip, grip,
grip, and then wham, just let go completely.  Not much warning.

As a side note, has anyone else tried the Potenza S-02s?  I
am currently running a set and I'm less than happy with the
rain performance.  The car sometimes just decides to move
halfway into another lane.  The SP8000s were much better in
this respect.  I'm using 205/55ZR16 and 225/50ZR16.  Maybe
wider tires are just no good in the rain.  Thoughts?
