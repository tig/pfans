"Question about loss of power"

My 87 951 was doing the same thing.  It acted like the rev limiter was kicking
in.   It could happen any where from 3500 rpm on up.  It would usually start
when pulling in the top end of third gear.  After that pushing down the gas in
either 3rd or 4th at most any rpm.  We checked the KLR tube, changed the knock
sensor, changed chips, ran a remote fuel pressure gauge into the cockpit,
checked and cleaned each layer of the fuse block and checked everything else my
mechanic could think of.  I poped a head gasket before we discovered the demon.

George B. indicated in a previous post that a Porsche mechanic in his area
chased a similar problem for 6 months.  We are checking and testing everything
before we put my engine back in.  If we find anything that points to the power
failure, I will post it.  BTW, my problem started as a slight stumble when
pulling third gear and progressively became more pronounced.
