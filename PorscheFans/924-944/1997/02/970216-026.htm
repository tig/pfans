944 Turbo S or 968?  I own an '88 Turbo S.  I love the car, but could do
without the turbo lag.  I haven't had the pleasure of a 968 test drive,
but from a distance I can imagine it would be a toss up.   Sure, I have a
slight performance advantage, but I'd be willing to sacrifice the edge for
better drivability.

What price for a used 944 Turbo S?  The seller of mine and I had a tough
time with that one.  We both agreed the prices asked in the Panorama were
inflated.  The NADA book doesn't list the Turbo S, so, with appologies to
the writer who offered the data, we found it useless.  Fortunately, the
Kelly Blue Book did list the car, and we agreed on the average selling
price listed.  It was several thousand dollars above the regular turbo
listed.  For the record, the "S" option on the original sticker was $5298.

Why aren't 968's more popular?  I'm only a recent Porsche owner, but I
remember that Porsche raised the price dramatically back in the late 80's. 
I think the prices just got too high.  I actually had a non-turbo 944 on
order back in early '85.  With modest options, it was about $25K.  I don't
know what a new 968 went for when it came out.  Can someone enlighten us? 

968's and 944's are certainly great cars - and that comes from a guy that
owns three Lotuses!
