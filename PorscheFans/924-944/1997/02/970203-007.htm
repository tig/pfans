Definitely the fuel accumulator.  It's stuffed way up behind the right wheel
and leaks when the diaphragm fails, or if you're lucky, when the fittings are
not tightened properly.  It's probably a bad diaphragm.  Mine burst after
the car had set unused for a couple of months.  A new accumulator cost about
$100 in the US (if you shop around) and takes about half an hour to install.
