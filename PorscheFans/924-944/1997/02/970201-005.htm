I recently purchased my 1987 924s in November of last year.  It has 50,000
miles and is in great condition.  I've noticed the following minor problems.
 Can anyone suggest how to correct them?:

A number of times after driving her I would come back outside about an hour
later and notice that the cooling fan is still running.  When I turned the
ignition key halfway (just shy of starting her) the fan would cut off and
usually not come on again.  If I did not happen to come back out though, the
fan would run all night and kill the battery.  Whats going on??

Second, when I start her in cold weather I get two forms of sounds from two
different areas of the car.  First is a very low soft muffled "bump-bump"
coming from the engine area... sounds like  "bump-bump(two seconds of
nothing)bump-bump(two seonds of nothing...etc., etc.!  The sound usually goes
away when the engine warms up but it concerns me just the same.  Anybody tell
me whats causing it and how (if I need to) fix it??

Secondly, at the same time that I start the engine in the cold and get the
sound noted above, I get a rattle from behind the stereo/air conditioning
controls on the center dash console.  This sound goes away when I rev up to
just above idle RPM's and completely goes away after the engine is warm as
well.  From what I know these sounds don't occur during warmer weather.  But
I really haven't had the car long enough to be totally sure of this.  Can
anyone help?  Greatly appreciated!
