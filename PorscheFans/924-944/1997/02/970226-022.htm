Well, finally got my own cooling problem fixed.  It took 
changing the thermo fan switch twice (the first one didn't
work until the top white mark was indicated on the gauge) and
also driled six small holes in the perimeter of the themostat.
Now, the car seems to be running at more normal temperature
levels. But....

Last night my car decided it was time to do the 1.3 bar
drill.  I was in second and accelerating hard when it 
felt like I hit a fuel shut off rev limiter around 4000 rpm.
Decided to park it for the night and discoverd that the
problem still remains today, but after some experimentation
I have found that the 'limiter' action happens whenever the
boost hits 1.3 bar or so and is not necessarily rev dependent.
I have had the 1.3 prob before for a few days but it was
not exactly like this.  The first time, the car drove fine
but just had limited boost.  Now, this 'rev limit' action is
very pronounced.  Perhaps the wastegate is faulty and was 
frozen open the first time and frozen shut now.  I also can
hear a hissing in the passenger compartment when idling. 
Could a vacuum leak near the computer cause the hissing and
the limiting of boost/revs?  I checked all the vacuum lines
under the hood with the exception of the one that goes to 
the bottom of the throttle body, but found nothing out of
sorts.  Oh, it was also raining last night and this morning.
Could something just be wet?  This is very frustrating, any
help would be dearly appreciated.
