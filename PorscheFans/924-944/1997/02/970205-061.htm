Doug - thanks for your mail. Based on your advice I think I will keep the
215s in front and get a wider tire in rear. According to your formula the
front tires (215s) are on a rim 83% their width (7J) so going by the same
ratio the rear rims should be holding 245s. Is there any reason Porsche
did not send the car out with the wider tire? Is it only a matter of cost?

Two other questions:  
1) I understand the track advantage of a lower profile tire with lower
final gearing, but for street use wouldn't a higher profile like 55 or 60
translate to more rubber, lower RPMs, better economy and higher top end
speeds? Are there any inherent disadvantages to higher profiles? The
reason I ask is I have not seen a single newer Porsche with aspect ratios
of more than 45, and they make my 215/60s look like truck tires!

2) In order to keep the same radius on my wheels when switching to wider
rear tires, what aspect ratio should I pick? My car has the stock tires
which are 215/60/15 which translates to 129mm height (60% of 215mm). If I
switch to 225s and keep the height of 129mm, the aspect ratio works out to
57. If I switch to 245s and keep the same height the aspect ratio needs
to be 53. Since to my knowledge 225/57/15s and 245/53/15s are not
available, what would be the best move without worrying about suspension
travel or wheel spacers. Thanks again.
