Doug:

I use a Recaro SRD for my Carrera that sees significant street and track
use.  This seat still has adjustable tilt and will tilt forward for access
to the back seat.  It has a little better side bolsters than a factory sport
seat (IMO), and more importantly, it has openings for shoulder harness and
anti-sub strap built in.   My wife and I both find this seat more
comfortable than the factory seat even for street use.  "I liked it so much,
I bought the company!!"   Well... actually, I set my company up as a Recaro
dealership (our primary business is commercial office furniture).  Contact
me privately if you would like pricing information.  

Downside of this seat is that even when sold at discount,  they are more
expensive than a lot of other seats available.  IMO partially because of
higher quality, partially because it has that nice RECARO emblem stitched
into it.
