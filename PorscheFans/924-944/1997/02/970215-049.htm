Hi Kenny,

I'm having the same problem. Seems as if the rev limiter is kicking in
and the car begins to buck as if the fuel has been cut. It happened once
while my mechanic was in the car, and he called it a misfire. They could
not give me a simple solution and needed time to properly diagnose. I
haven't taken the car back since (loss of confidence in shop...long
story) but someone on the list had suggest a knock sensor or vacuum
leak.

Also, my problem developed after some recent water pump and belt
servicing. I got the service shortly after buying the car but never came
across the problem until the service.

As far as the compression theory...my car (88 951) has 73,500 and was
giving a compression check at the local Porsche dealer before I
purchased. Compression was fine.

Let me know if you come up with anything...or if anyone else has
experienced this.
