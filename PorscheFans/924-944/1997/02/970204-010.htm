Roger,
      I have replaced the rear speakers in my 944, and had to remove the rear 
windows in order to remove the panels covering the speakers.  (The foam had 
rotted on the original speakers)  I used pieces of plexiglass to carefully pry 
the rubber moulding for the rear windows while removing the glass, and used a 
similer technique while installing.  Once you have the glass removed, you will 
have to peel the vinyl from the window openings, as it is glued.  I also took 
the opportunity to clean the rubber on the rear windows with the glass removed.
I am interested in what you did to place the larger speakers in your front 
doors.

Good Luck!

Ezra

Subject: Early 944 rear speakers

Hi,

Has anyone out there replaced their rear speakers? I started to
do it yesterday, and realized that if I continued, I was going
to have some big problems getting it back to normal. On the
early cars, the vinyl that covers the rear quarter trim panel
looks as though it's tucked up under the little rear window
trim. I'm afraid to yank it out of there.

I once changed these speakers on my 924 but this whole area was
already majorly bunged-up on that car. I vowed that I would not
live like that again! Is there a secret, or do I have to pull out
the little windows? Is it too much to ask to have some decent
tunes? This is only one of many snags to come, I'm sure. I'm
re-doing the whole system. If anyone's interested, I've already
figured out a nifty way to replace the door speakers with 5.25
inch separates (maybe 6.25's) without cutting my precious door
panels. E-mail for details.

Thanks,

ROG
