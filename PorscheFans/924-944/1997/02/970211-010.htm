  1989 model year, which was only worth around $14,500 in excellent
  condition.
  
  I find it hard to believe that anyone could actually purchase an '89 951
  in excellent condition for less than $15K.  If they can, I'd like to know
  where :-)  My son paid over $20K for his last summer.  Admittedly, his car
  only had 37,531 miles and was nearly flawless, but this still seems a lot
  more than the "going rate."  If the prices listed in Excellence don't
  reflect the real market, what good are they?

 I think Bruce was right on the money in his pricing of 944 Turbo S and '89
Turbo. We have had cars as low as 9500, in PML, within the last year and many
in the 11500 - 14500 range.
 
 In my 944 issue, I pointed out that the 944 Turbo S is probably the best
high performance dollar value in the world right now. Even at $20k!
 
 And this, from a 356 and 911 fanatic...
