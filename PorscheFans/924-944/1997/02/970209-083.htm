Hello, 
 
Here's one of those questions that comes around regularly I assume, although 
I've only been on the list about a month and haven't seen it yet (maybe it was 
buried in all the DRIVER'S EDUCATION AT MID-OHIO emails). 
 
Anyway, I'm getting ready to put a stereo in my 944S2 and I want to install a 
really nice system without getting too crazy.  What I mean is that I'm willing 
to spend a couple hundred bucks on speakers (maybe a little more if I hear 
that it's worth it).  Does anyone have recommendations for front and rear 
speakers.  Model #s and approximate price would be appreciated.  Actually 
'entire system' recommendations would be welcome as I'm researching the whole 
thing (but am primarily concerned with speakers). 
 
Thanks, 
 
Eric
