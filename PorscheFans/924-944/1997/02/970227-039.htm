                Hello all, let me introduce myself  I am Frankie and the very
soon to be proud owner of a '82 924, the 2  liter 4 cyl. no turbo, but I have
the sunroof to compensate.  I have always had a great appreciation for
Porsches and was particularly fond of the 911's till about two years ago.  I
began dating a girl whose father drives a '90 or 91 944 ragtop blk on blk and
gorgeous, I saw all 944's in a new perspective after seeing and driving in
this car.  So when this opportunity arose I jumped at it immediatly. The car
will be mine in a week to two depending when he arrives from his business
trip from England before the move.  I currently drive a 93 explorer and plan
to have the 924 as a project car as it has been run through the course of
 years but usually stays in storage so surely will need fair work.  I am
writing to inquire where I could go to get or order a 924 manual or other
pertinent information.

                                                          Thank you in
advance,




                                                                      Frankie
