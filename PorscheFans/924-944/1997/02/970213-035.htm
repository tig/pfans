"K27 turbo upgrade"

In our mutual quest for the elusive "more power", I have talked to several who
have installed K-27s.  The general consensus is that if you are racing the car,
the K26 will poop out at high rpm.  The K27 still has punch at high rpm.  On the
street or in mid-range the the K26 is more responsive.  I have run both a K26
and a Cup Car or Turbo S K26.  The Cup turbo has a larger hot side and hence
less mid-range but pulls stronger from 5500 to 7000 rpm.  There was an article
in Excellence about turbo sizing a few years back. It stated that the K26 was
sized better for the 2.5L 944 than the K27 for all around operation.  

Ease of installation, ease should be removed from the equation.  The flat rate
is 13 hours R&R, I think (Dave?).  If you plan on doing it yourself, double or
triple the hours for the first attempt.  Plan on adding new additions to your
toolbox and inventing several new swear words in the process.  Other than that,
a piece of cake.

Using good old 20-20 hindsight, would I change turbos again?  A resounding No is
my answer.  If it was a track car, the answer would be yes.  I'm excited about
finally getting my engine back together but am not looking forward to those
lower turbo nuts.  BTW, the Cup turbo is going back on.
