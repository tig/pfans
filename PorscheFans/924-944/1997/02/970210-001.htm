I agree with the stats in Bruces article.  If you check the Kelly Blue Book 
prices you'll find that they also agree.  I found an 88 944TS at a Chevy 
dealer with 45K miles on it in immaculate condition, documented one owner car, 
just last month and posted it to this list.  A friend of mine bought it for 
$11.8K.  I just sold my 89 944T to another friend for $13.5K, 92K miles in 
immaculate condition. 
 
I saw and drove another 89 944T in excellent condition that changed hands for 
$10K and just missed a very nice 88944TS Special edition rose and plaid model 
with 75K that sold for around $12K.  You'll see ads reflecting much higher 
prices but I'll bet the rubber most often meets the road in the  14.5K range 
for one in excellent condition.  And like George B. says, if it's the car you 
absolutely want, go buy it.  Price may not be that much of an issue for you. 
 
An interesting note about these cars is that amongst the cognisenti(porsche 
folks, racers), they're very special. However, amongst the general car buying 
public, they don't look a lot different from an 83 944 and there is a general 
bad rap about maintenance.  This has tended to drive prices down.  The Chevy 
dealer that had the 944TS didn't have a clue as to what he had. All they knew 
was that it was in nice shape so they gambled and sold it rather than 
wholesale it to another dealer or auction it.  If you want one, they're out 
there at the prices Bruces article quotes and even less if you shop around.

Just saw Bruce Anderson's Market Report on 924-944-968 cars in the latest
Excellence.  The prices listed for 944 Turbo cars seem awfully low for the
1989 model year, which was only worth around $14,500 in excellent
condition.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could actually purchase an '89 951
in excellent condition for less than $15K.  If they can, I'd like to know
where :-)  My son paid over $20K for his last summer.  Admittedly, his car
only had 37,531 miles and was nearly flawless, but this still seems a lot
more than the "going rate."  If the prices listed in Excellence don't
reflect the real market, what good are they?
