List members,
	I've a grievous bu-bu to confess.  I'm the Marylander with the 314000 
miles on my 85.5 944.  About a month ago I responded to a query about 
high mileage 944s and mentioned I was getting 40mpg to boot with no 
rebuild in sight (and none in the past).  Well, I've got good news and 
I've got news that may make my degree granting institutions stare at the 
ground and swirl one foot in little circles.  The good news is there's 
no rebuild in sight.  Now the rest...

Several list members wrote to ask me what the secret of the fuel economy 
was.  So many, in fact, that I started to wonder "hey, how come nobody 
else is seeing 40mpg?  Which, admittedly, seems high even to me though 
within reach of my '89 Nissan Sentra."  So I went back through my trusty 
log.  I keep a log of every fueling and, about every three months, 
transfer the data to a Clarisworks spreadsheet.  Various cells in the 
spreadsheet have definitions which tell the computer what to add, 
divide, etc..  After the first month or two of driving my 944, I added a 
row here and a column there to incorporate more data.

Unfortunately, I got careless and two very important calculated cells 
were assigned incorrect definitions.  In horror, I spent a couple hours 
straightening this out this weekend.  The results will likely set many 
normally aspirated hearts at ease.  I've been getting 31 or so mpg on 
long road trips and 22-25 mpg in town (Annapolis.  Stop & go).

I'm so sorry ya'll.  I feel like such a putz.  Anyway, karma whipped 
right around and bit my bottom.  I was in the shop last week for new 
(well, reworked) control arms, a tie-rod end, turn-signal combo switch 
$$$, couple tires, and a speedo head.  Oh God!  Please Lord, not my 
SPEEDO HEAD.  My badge of honor is gone.  

The old head sits right here on my desk, sleeping the deep sleep.  And 
the new head, freshly mounted in my car, reads 000012 miles.  All I've 
got to show off now is this lame sticker in my door jamb stating the 
date and mileage at which the head was changed.

Perhaps someone could make a unique and attractive clock for me with the 
old head. 

Heavy hearted, but light footed,
Dave Cherry
