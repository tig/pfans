If it is the same setup as mine, the portion of the cable that goes through
the drive motor is a facsimile of a "ladder" spur gear and the drive motor
has a typical round spur gear. The "ladder" portion is formed out of the
round stock so the teeth cover 360 degrees about the long axis (around the
shaft). The teeth eventually become stripped (either through normal use
and/or misadjustment). I successfully disasembled my unit and rotated the
ladder portion almost 180 degrees. This gave the drive motor fresh teeth
with which to engage. There are also two relays (one for up, one for down)
and two microswitches on the back side of the motor bracket, the latter are
for adjusting the stop points (these are miserable to adjust properly, at
least on my car).

Good luck!
