I want to thank all of you for the helpful replies on my fan switch problem.
That looks like one of the easier ones to take care of.
        I still can't figure out what's wrong with my turn signal indicator.
All the bulbs are fine.  This seems to have stumped many of you too- am I
the only one who has experienced this?
        I could never get my trip odometer reset button (within the vent on
my dash) to work either.  Car on or off, it doesn't seem to make a
difference.  I've never bothered to take off the vent to look inside,
because the loss of that feature never really bothered me that much.  Some
PorscheFans have been discussing this problem recently, but I didn't see any
solutions posted.  If a solution was provided privately, I would also
appreciate any info on the button's mechanical properties so that I can
decide if fixing this little button will take me 30 minutes or 3 hours (or
cost $$$$$).  Otherwise, I can live with the trip meter reading:  [9][4][4]
or some other ridiculous figure.  My passengers are always amazed to see how
far I travel on a tank of gas.
        Sprained my left ankle last night playing night basketball and tore
3 ligaments (AGAIN!).  Clutch work is going to SUCK!  Thanks again fellows!
