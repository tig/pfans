I have a 1979 RHD 924 which had a similar problem. You really had to stamp
on the brake pedal to get the lights to shine.  I replaced bulbs, pads and
checked the shoes before discovering that the problem was the wire
connectors on the master cylinder.  

My 79 has two pressure switches that come off the master cylinder.  Each
switch has three blade connectors on it.  The previous owner had bent one
of these blades on each switch when he was putting the connectors back on. 
All I had to do was straighten the blade connector slide the connector back
on to the switch and Bob  was me uncle.

If this is not your problem check that the switches are working by using a
multi meter on the switch while someone presses the brake pedal.  If the
switch has gone then you can buy them from "AUTOMOTION" for about $5.98 US
each & about $10.00 postage and handling to get them to AUS.

All the best
