Yes, 225's and 245's will physically fit in the wheel wells of your 951.
Even if it's an '86, the extra width on the rims/tires should be "absorbed"
on the inside side of your wheels if installed properly.  In other words,
fatter tires on your 951 shouldn't project outward and rub into your
fenders- you only need to worry about the clearance space behind your
wheels.  I know for a fact that 86 951's take 225/245 tires because I've
seen it done many times.  There's at least an inch to an inch and a half
margin to work with (Both front and rear).  I thought later 951's came with
the 225/245 combination anyway, since the '86 was the one without ABS?
        As for suspension wear, I have no clue.  Personally, I think HOW you
use the wider tires will determine how much faster you wear your suspension.
Are you considering this for aesthetics or handling enhancement?
