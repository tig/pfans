    Subject: Water Leak..


Hello all...

     I was hoping someone can give this `new boy` some advice. After pulling 
up yesterday I noticed a thin trail of water behind the car (I had only 
moved it 300 yards from work to the pub car park !)  Looking undernreath I 
couldn`t see anything dripping so I invested in a swift half while I though 
about it. Later, I started her up and let her run for a few minutes, a small 
patch (5cm) of water appeared. I then drove up and down a bit, another small 
patch appeared. It looks like its comming from the left hand side (as you 
sit in the car) about 6 inches from the side. Can someone please tell me 
it`s not the water pump !! I`ve taken the precaution of not driving the car 
since !  Isn`t the water pump at the front of the engine, midway between the 
lights ? Excuse my ignorance, my Haynes manual is still on order at the 
local book shop..!! She`s due for a full 85,000 mile service next week as 
well....


TIA

Garry.
