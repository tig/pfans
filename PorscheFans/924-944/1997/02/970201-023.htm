I own and drive a 1987 951 and had written before on my starting
problem, but there seems to be still many people with this problem.  I
had received so much advice, good and bad, on how to fix this problem,
but was chasing "red herrings" and spent too much money fixing
everything but the actual problem until recently.

My problem was that approximately 1-2 months after buying the car, it
would intermittantly start.  The car would crank reliably, but would not
"kick-in."  After it eventually started, I could turn the car off and it
would start every time.  This would happen on cold and hot starts, in a
random manner.  I had replaced a DME relay, fuel pump and controller
unit (and even killed a battery in the process), but nothing would fix
this annoying problem.

I moved to VA and found a great mechanic and he fixed it for a couple of
bucks (I think he charged me for the sandpaper)and told me that my
reference controller contacts were corroded and he had to scrape it
clean and use contact grease to keep it from recorroding.  The car
reliably starts ALL the time now and I am sorry I didn't find this out
sooner.

To all of you out there... I am not a mechanic and I will not pretend to
be one, so... I don't really know exactly where or how to clean these
connections.  I'll ask my mechanic the next time I see him.

By the way... I was told my many different mechanics that the original
DME relay was faulty and has the tendency to go bad to mimic my
problem.  There apparently is a newer design relay that work better.
