Hello Steven and all:

This is what I've heard, and I don't even smoke cigars.

Porsche had a difficulty with some of the 944 cabs with a vibration at
certain speeds.  I'm no engineer, so please don't pick on me for improper
terms, but I think at some harmonic frequency the car would vibrate.  The
weight is probably an effort to eliminate this vibration.  My understanding
is that the condition was completely eliminated with the 968 cab.

Any comments from S2 cab owners??
