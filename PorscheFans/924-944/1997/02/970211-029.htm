Hi, Alec 
	I have a 944 with 120k miles on it and I only owner. I use moble 
1 20-50 as summer and 15-40 as winter (Washington DC aera) I do not have 
any problems with leaks, although I do use a 1/2 quart every 1500 miles.

I race a 914-4 which has run the same mix as above, and after pulling the 
motor down  after a pair of seasons it looks great inside and the wear is 
minimal.

My wifes SAAB 900 which had been using Castrol was shiffed over to moble 
1 and the front (or Saab Back) seal leaked, I replaces it and it runs 
great with #1.  

All in all I have been told that german motors are made to run on heavyer 
weights of oil than Jap or US stuff. And that if you go too thin you will 
eatup the bearings. I do know guys who qulify with light weight oil like 
5-30 and then race with 20-50, but thats a risk 

Any way thats my input worth 2 cents or less.
