The Porsche factory recommends Chevron Techroline additive (in the US, I
don't know if it is available elsewhere) if you feel you have deposits in
your fuel injectors.  If you have problems with moisture condensation in
your fuel tank it is safe to use a 'fuel system drier' type of additive
that contains alchohol (methanol, if I am not mistaken) as its main
ingredient.  The alchohol causes pooled water in the fuel tank to be
absorbed back into the fuel so it can be safely burned, without the engine
noticing.  Occasional use will not harm any seals.  I refueled at a
station a month or so ago that had water in their fuel. The car ran
terribly, and the fuel dryer cured it instantly. 

If it has been ages since you changed your fuel filter, do it before using
an additive, to prevent any nasties in there from being loosened by the
additive, contaminating your system. 

Nothing else is recommended.  Stay away from octane boosters.  It's for 
those hopped up American V8 hot rods with high compression ratios.
