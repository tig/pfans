Does anyone have two different insurance companies?  As in, one company for
family/mundane cars, and a different one for their Porsche?  Here in Ft
Worth, I'm paying $750/yr to State Farm for my '84 944 to get 100/300
liability and comp (no collision) with a $500 deductible, plus the usuals for
uninsured motorists, PIP, etc.  Good driver; no tickets in 17 years.  No
accidents.  Over 40.  This is billed as a "pleasure use only - not for work
or school".  Leland West, who advertises in most of the p-car magazines,
quoted me about $320 for a limited use policy with the same limits which
included collision!

When I asked State Farm about this, they said that Texas law states that if
you don't have all vehicles under the same policy that you don't have
automatic 30 day coverage if you buy a new car, you aren't covered if you
rent a car, and two or three other items.

I called a friend who works in the insurance business, and he says that the
rates I have are the best in Texas; there's no way that they (as an
independent agency) can get anywhere near them.

Anyone out there have any alternative approaches to this that don't leave 'em
hung out to dry?

OR, if State Farm is just yankin' my chain, is anyone aware of a source of
 information I can reference to refute their claims?

Many thanks...
