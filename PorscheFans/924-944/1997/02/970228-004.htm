Some information from Larry Reynolds.  Note that I tried P21s Total Auto Wash 
on my Guards Red '84 944 back in 1990, and I didn't like it-- left too many bad 
water spots.  I have used Sonax Auto Shampoo to for 11 years on the four 
944s/951s I have owned (the P21s was an experiment), and it really keeps the 
paint fresh.  In either case, I think it is important not to get whatever 
product you are using on th eengine onto the exterior paint.

Dear Mike:

<< Watch out for Simple Green on these cars.  I think that it may stain the
wheels permanently.  The PO of my '87 951 used the stuff on the silver forged
"dish" wheels, and they have permanent streaks.

The reason for avoiding Simple Green is that it is highly acidic.  The stains
are reactions with the anodizing on the wheels. 


Instead of P21S Wheel Cleaner, you might try P21S Total Auto Wash Citrus
Degreaser.  It seems to remove grease and oil better than the Wheel Cleaner.


I am enclosing an article I wrote on cleaning engines that may help.

Engines and Culinary Delights

Why should you clean the engine compartment?  Rust prevention, early
oil/fluid leak detection, early belt wear detection and cosmetics are among
the prime reasons.  (There is a rumor that certain series of Porsches have a
factory designed engine oil leakage feature to assist in rust prevention for
the non-galvanized rear quarter panels and trunk areas.)

To soften the grease and grunge collected on your engine compartment, start
the engine, let it warm up for a few minutes and shut it off.  The proper
cleaning temperature of the engine is warm but not hot.  If you can just hold
your hand to the engine without burning it, then it is warm enough to clean.
 As the engine cools to proper temperature, use the time to cover the few
openings on a Porsche motor that dislike ingesting water.  The air intake/air
filter, the distributor, the coil and the oil dipstick/breather are among the
few sensitive areas.  Porsche builds an engine that is so water proof that it
would probably run under water.

Use plastic baggies and rubber bands to cover the air intake/air filter(s=)
and the distributor/coil. Place a double layer of baggies over the air in=
take
and secure with a couple of rubber bands.  Use a pair of two gallon size
baggies to cover the distributor and plug wires around the distributor ca=
p.
 This may be difficult to seal, but the idea is to prevent significant
amounts of water possibly shorting out the distributor.  If the cap is in
good condition, it will be "waterproof", so this is only a preventative
measure.  The coil is also =93waterproof=94, so baggies are again a preventative
measure.  Check the tightness of the oil filler cap, the power steering
filler cap, windshield washer fluid cap, oil dip stick, battery filler caps
and all other engine compartment opening caps and secure baggies over the=m
with rubber bands.  One area on 1983 to 1988 944s that is often overlooked,
is the timing belt inspection opening on the cam gear drive cover (the si=lver
metal base beneath the distributor cap).  There is a 3/8" inspection hole at
the one o'clock position.  There should be a rubber plug in this hole. About
40% of all 944s I have inspected are missing this plug.  If yours is
missing, place a couple of baggies over the cam gear cover and secure with
rubber bands .  (You could also plug it with your finger, but this will
somewhat limit your reach.)  The best bet is to order a new one
(924S/944/944T - #944-105-131-00, 87-88 944S #944-105-131-01) and pop itin.

Now that your engine is warm and sealed, spray the entire engine/engine
compartment with a quality non petroleum based degreaser.  Try to start from
the bottom and work up.  This way, you don't have the degreaser droppin=g on
you as you clean the underside areas.  My two favorite engine cleaners are
P21S Total Auto Wash and Wurth Citrus Degreaser.  I find that either of these
two products will clean thoroughly, and not harm the paint or finish of the
aluminum components.  One note of caution, all degreasers will remove your
nice coat of wax.  If you get overspray on the waxed areas, plan on rewax=ing.

Allow the degreaser about 3-5 minutes to work and then use a 100% cotton
towel or a =93SOFT=94 brush to =93GENTLY=94 brush the heavily soiled area=
s.  Respray and rebrush any areas that need additional cleaning.  Once the 
entire engine/engine compartment has been cleaned, rinse thoroughly with water.
There is a debate as to the optimum force of spray to rinse the degreaser.
Some say a gentle spray is all that is necessary, while others advocate =
theuse of a high pressure spray.  Use your common sense, the stronger the spray,
the more likely you will get water in sensitive parts.  If all areas are
properly protected, you should have no problems with a stronger spray.  If
any areas need additional cleaning, repeat as necessary.

Once the engine/engine compartment is clean, immediately remove all of your
plastic baggies/rubber bands.  Dry any =93puddles=94 and aluminum parts with a
soft 100% cotton towel.  Use paper towels to thoroughly dry the battery (if
it is in the engine compartment).  Start the engine and allow it to warm up.
 This will dry the rest of the engine and evaporate any moisture that may
have collected in sensitive components. =20

Once everything is dry and has completely cooled, you may wish to apply a
coating of rubber protectant to the rubber hoses, rubber wires, plastic
shields and rubber gaskets .  Meguiar #42 Rubber Treatment, Meguiar #40 
Vinyl/Rubber Treatment, Sonax Rubber Maintenance Spray or Wurth Rubber Care
Spray all work extremely well.  I do not recommend treating the underside=
of the rubber belts, as this makes them reluctant to turn their respective
pulleys, with somewhat interesting results.  (This is somewhat like waxing 
brake pads)

The painted areas of your engine compartment should be waxed.  If there are
any areas that are difficult to reach, Sonax makes a spray wax that requires
little buffing and offers excellent protection.  Spray a light coat on these
areas and buff as much as possible.  Two thin coats are much better than one
heavy coat.

If the aluminum areas are dull or have whitish corrosion, a mild metal polish
will help restore the finish.  Two of my favorites are Wurth 21S Metal Finish
Restorer Polish and Blue Magic Metal Polish.  Use a soft 100% cotton towel
and work a small amount into the surface and buff out with another cotton
towel.

Check the battery terminals, to insure that they are clean.  If not,
disconnect the cables and clean both the cable terminals and battery posts
with a wire brush.  Reconnect the terminals and retighten.  Wurth makes a
nifty  Battery Terminal Spray that protects the terminals from corrosion and
changes from yellow to pink if there is battery acid leakage.

All of the hinges, throttle cables, cruise control cables and hood shocks
should receive a thin coating of non-silicone lubricant such as Wurth
HHS-2000 Spray Lube.  Lastly, check all fluid levels, remove any stray
baggies and you are finished!

Now that your engine compartment is squeaky clean, it may be time to prepare
some culinary delights.  Some of my favorites from the =93Official Road Kill
Cookbook=94 include windshield wabbit, grilled grouse, manifold muskrat and
last but not least, phender pheasant roasted to perfection on the intercooler
of 930 a Turbo.
