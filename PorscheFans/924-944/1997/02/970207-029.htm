Hi to everybody,

I have to say that I am very impressed with the tecnical knowledge
this group shares.  I think I am in the right place :)
I am in the market to purchase a '87 951.  Does anyone know
any good machanic (knows 951 really well) in the San Francisco bay 
area where I can take the car to for a complete checkup?  
The guy offered me a good deal on it but I noticed several 
problems already.  

First, I think the rear CV joint is gone because 
I can hear "Click, Click...." from the rear.  I guess it 
doesn't really matter which way I turn to figure which side
has the bad CV joint since it is a rear-wheel drive. Correct me if 
I am wrong.  

Second, the sunroof cannot be open/close and one side of the 
hinge(the one with the teeth) is completely gone and is
not securing to the roof.  At some point while driving at 70mph my
friend
can see one side of the sunroof lifting by the wind.  Where I can
find this missing hinge?  I am afraid even the junk yard refuse
to sell me that part and have me to buy the complete sunroof. 

Third, the guy showed me a complete service record of the car but
it seems like all these years the water pump was never been
replaced.
The car has 140,000 miles already and I thought usually people 
replace their 944 water pump at the same time when they replace the
timing belt.  The guy already replaced 2 timing belts and one just
recently done.  Should I expect to change the water pump ASAP
even so far I don't notice any leak?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it!
Hope some of you can answer some of my questions.  Thanks a lot!!!!
:)

Tom,
