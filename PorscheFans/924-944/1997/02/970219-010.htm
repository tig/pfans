Hi Sam,

Unsolicited (but free!) advice. Bank the money. Spend it on the track
weekends and keeping your car maintained to the highest possible standards.

Lots of things will start needing attention when you track/autox it. Tires,
brakes, wheel bearings, clutches and ball joints come to mind. If you do 4
track events this year you will probably spend $1,000 just for entry fees,
gas, food and possibly lodging. A good helmet, tires and brake pads for the
events will cost you at least another $1,000.

Hit the track. Resist the urge to spend the money on the car. Compensate
by buying high-quality safety gear and taking care of normal maintenance
items ahead of schedule.

After a season of this you will be in a much better position to decide what
(if anything) you would like to do to the car.

Doug (BTDT) Donsbach
