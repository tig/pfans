Michael Samuels wrote about considering the 968 in place of the 944 Turbo
S. Price trends for the 944 Turbo S and 1989 Turbo have been spooky at
best.  I have been carefully following the prices on Turbos to get a feel
for the market.  One thing that is hard to decipher is the actual price the
car sold for.  Many cars list for high values, however, the owners settle
for something less.  It is very rare that the actual sale price is higher
than the listed price, so it is fair to assume that the listed price is a
bit unrealistic.

I have recently returned from the library where I photocopied the NADA
price list for cars between 1989 and back.  I have just finished inputting
the raw data into Excel (spreadsheet and graph) for all 944 and 968 models.
This spreadsheet includes NADA loan and resale values.  As a disclaimer,
the 1988 Turbo is listed as one model and is not split out into the Turbo
and Turbo S models, so I do not know which model they are quoting.

For anyone interested, I would be glad to E-mail you a copy of this
spreadsheet at your request.  Data from 1990 through 1995 is gathered from
NADA third quarter of 1996, and the pre 1990 data is good until April 1997.
I will try to update this sheet as I go.

In addition, I have found a few web sites of interest to the Porsche
shopper.  The first is the Kelly Blue Book guide on line at:
http://www.kbb.com
The seconded is a web site sponsored by Automotion That lets you cruise
through nation wide lists of Porsches:
http://www.best.com/~dem/pcd/pcd_main.htm
Again these are asking prices.  If anyone knows how to collect data on
actual sales prices, please let me know.

Michael makes a good point with the 968 in comparison with the Turbo
models.  There have been several articles in Excellence (I will be
compiling a complete list of all Excellence articles this Spring) which
have pointed out that the 968 can be an equal contender to the stock Turbo
S when you factor "drivability" into the equation.  On paper, the Turbo S
will post faster 0 - 60 mph, and quarter mile times, but if you add up and
downshifts into the eqaution, the 968 gains back some of that lost time due
to a fatter torque curve and better designed shift points in the gear box.
Still there is much more potential under the hood of any 944 Turbo to be
tapped with the aftermarket add ons.

This is a sample of some of the data I have found for the 968 and 944 Turbo
price trends and loan values in the NADA booklet.  Convertables are not
included.  High and low values are sampled from Automotion web site.
              NADA              Automotion
968      Loan      Retail     Low        High
1995    $25,650   $32,200    $32,950   $39,988
1994    $22,525   $28,500    $29,995   $40,000
1993    $20,325   $25,900    $25,000   $30,000
1992    $19,525   $24,875    $22,000   $29,000  (one was $36,000!)

944 T    Loan      Retail     Low        High
1989    $11,100   $14,725    $14,500   $20,000
1988    $9,600    $12,950    $10,000   $19,000  (Includes Turbo & Turbo S)
1987    $8,325    $11,450    $7,700    $15,500  (one was $20,000!)
1986    $7,200    $10,100    $6,975    $11,000  (one was $24,000!)

I have mentioned a few very high prices (in parentheses) to illustrate some
cars asking prices are not in line with the NADA retails.  These cars could
be very special low mileage collectables, or the owners may just think they
are very special.

One thing to consider is the value that the bank (loan value) and your
insurance company consider your vehicle is worth.  With the Turbo's selling
prices being higher than the NADA book values (assuming that the owners are
getting higher prices) your loan power is some what less, not to mention
you need to have your insurance agent adjust your coverage to include
premium prices above book value.

In conclusion, the 1989 Turbo and 1988 Turbo S cars are rare (2,103 U.S.
models sold) and it becomes much more difficult to set a fair retail price
with such low numbers and a healthy demand.  On the other hand, the 968 is
newer and follows a more predictable path of devaluation despite less than
13,000 cars shipped to the U.S.A.  However, the data gathered above seems
to show that both classes of cars are not deviating from the retail price
norms by too much (bear in mind older cars are available in all
conditions).  It is plain to see that the older Turbo models give you some
real bang for the buck and they are reasonably reliable cars!
