How Do Folks,

I have an '87 951 and I remember reading somewhere that my year model =
was not equipped with the dreaded oil-water cooling assembly and that it =
only has a air-to-oil cooler for engine oil cooling.  Is this true?  If =
so, does the air-oil cooler have a thermostatic valve to control flow to =
avoid over cooling the oil on colder days?  I know there is an air-oil =
cooler mounted beside the bottom of the windshield washer fluid tank - =
what is it for, the power steering fluid or engine oil?

In a related issue, I recently switched to 10W-40 oil for winter use =
because I felt the 20W-50 was too viscous for cold-morning start-ups ( =
the pressure would stay pegged at 5 bar for a long time during warm-up =
and would be right at 5 bar at cruising speed).  Even with a switch to =
10W-40 the engine oil pressure never goes below 3 bar at idle during the =
winter.  It is amazing how much the aluminum finned oil pan and oil =
cooler cool all that oil.   My question is, does anyone feel that I'm =
making a mistake running this car with this viscosity grade?  I use =
Castrol GTX conventional oil only and change religiously at 3000 mile or =
6 month intervals.  The car has 54K miles.  From the records of the =
previous owner, he only used the 20W-50 grade. BTW, there is no change =
in oil consumption, the engine still uses none that I can detect between =
changes.

In a related issue, I feel that the super gooey 20W oils are way too =
viscous for operation in below 30 degree F operation and this may =
explain a lot of the oil cooler seal failures.  Even with the mild =
Georgia (USA) winters, my oil pressure was staying pegged at 5 bar for =
quite a while on warm-up, so who knows what the actual pressure is at =
the oil cooler itself.  I don't know what the pressure relief valve =
opens at, but the engine keeps plenty of pressure with a 10W oil, if you =
trust the gauge.  I know, I know ... turbo's run hotter and the turbo =
bearing experiences high temps, but if  both oils are rated at API SJ, =
there temperature stability is the same, no?

Any opinions are appreciated!  Maybe let's re-open the engine oil =
thread?

Thanx,=20
