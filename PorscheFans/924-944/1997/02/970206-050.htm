Subj:	Belt slap

Surya, when I purchased my 951 I had the same problem. The belt would
start to slap, then when warm it would stop. Since I own a "super-gage"
I was able to do the belt myself. But I can tell you a problem with
the gauge that I had. It is actually a manufacturing problem during the
manufacture of my gauge. The story is as follows:

I purchase the gauge from an owner of a 83 944 who use to work
on it himself. He had upgraded to a 911 (his opinion) and did not need
it any longer. It was brand new I only paid $75. (sorry everyone). The
first time I used it to adjust the belts it took 4 days. I could not
get the reading right and I did not want to start the car. After the third 
day I was an expert using the gauge. On the 4th day I very carefully
adjusted the belts making sure I did not distrub the gauge at all. The 
readings were correct. I only found out what the problem was by talking
to my friend the Porsche mechanic. Thee problem was that the two slides
the contact the belts were off-center. These slide spin on a rod. The holes
in the slides are off centeer causing a mis-reading. Your mechanic will have
to use the calibration tool to determine the correct position. If he then
put an "X" on one side of each slide he can then use the tool correctly.
(If he has one like mine). If you have any questions call me 408-434
3249. I hope this helps.
