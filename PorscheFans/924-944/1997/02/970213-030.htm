Unless you're wanting to go racing/time trialing with a Porsche Club, get the 
RX7 Twin Turbo.  It's  very fast, handles well and IMHO is a sexier car 
overall.  You can dump 10K into your car  and you won't positively impact the 
value of your car...but then you have to live with the ladies saying, "Wow, 
what a sexy car! Huh? It's a Mazda?.......oh....." as opposed to "Wow, 
nice.... Porsche....is it?"

Hello all...

I've been having a conversation with an online acquaintance ( on the RX-7
mailing list) concerning my quandary about selling my 88 944T and getting
a 3rd gen. RX-7.  I was wondering if I could get some other opinions,
maybe from someone whose driven both.

I'm not mistaken, that is faster than a stock

 How much can you do to a 4-cyl engine?  One

dogs.

used to.  Sometimes I feel like I'm driving a van.

Thanks in advance for any info

P.S.  No one will talk to me on the RX-7 mailing list anymore.  Someone
made a comment saying that a 2nd generation RX-7 looks like a 944, only
better!  I just couldn't take that lying down...consequently I'm
currently being ostracized.
