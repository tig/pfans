When you can hear your fuel pump whine (from the right rear corner of the
car on 951's- I'm pretty sure they're in a similar location on 924's), that
means you're either straining your pump or it's about to go.  My fuel pump
starting whining in my 951, and it turned out that I all I needed to do was
adjust the richness of the fuel mixture to take the load off my pump (It
needed to be adjusted anyway).  However, my whining was intermittent.  If
yours is continuous, you may have to replace your pump soon.  But be sure to
check the fuel filter first.  It may just be gunked up, and a new filter is
cheaper than a new pump.  Take care of this matter soon, or else you may be
left stranded somewhere.  The fuel pump can go at any time once it has
starting whining!  It might last you months, or maybe a few miles.
