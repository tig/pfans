	This is a good sign, at least. While sitting still, can you
	turn the wheels all the way from side to side with one hand
	fairly easily? That's what the assist is supposed to be like.

	No clue here.

	Lots of people. Go to the PLatz Mall (www.platz.com) and get
	the phone numbers for all the porsche mail order places. Give
	the a ring and comparison shop. The 944 is that exotic, btw :)

	You can get a new one from a dealer for about 35 or 40 bucks.
	The unlighted models are somewhat cheaper.

	Good question. Anyone?

	No clue here, either.
