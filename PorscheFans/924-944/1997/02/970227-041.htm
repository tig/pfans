Well, I took this evening to troubleshoot the problem on
my car with the limited boost.  After a buddy and I checked
all of the vacuum lines, I decided to check the line which
connects to the computer under the passenger floor board.
I pulled everything out and decided that it looked fine.
Next, we checked the compressor bypass valve.  I discovered
that I could blow through it with ease.  This is at least 
part of the problem.  Additionally, I noticed that one of
the intercooler lines hose clamps looked awkward and, to
my chagrin, discovered that the rubber hose and aluminum
pipe which lead from the turbo to the intercooler was not
tightened, and that the two lines were about to come apart
on their own.  Well, I tightened down the clamp and put it
all back together.  Now, I'm hitting almost full boost even
with the bad bypass valve.  I plan to order a new valve
tomorrow, so my car should be running pretty strong.
