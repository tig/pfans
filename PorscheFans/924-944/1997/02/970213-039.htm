First off congratulations on the car... Now the bad news...
Actually its not too bad, the 944 has a few spots that stereo equipment 
can go.  The trunk is pretty much the only option you have, there's no 
room under the seats, or in the back seat area (I've seen it done and it 
looks poor.)  Unfortunately the fuel tank is the floor of the trunk so 
you can't bolt anything to it, and the back seat folds over so you 
probably don't want to bolt anything to it either.

I recently put a stereo into my 944T and here is how I did it:
Two Phoenix Gold Sapphire 1.4x amps. (crossover built in)
Two Pioneer 8" Bandpass Boxes 
Apline 6disc Changer and Head
Plus 4 Kenwood 2x6 2way speakers (HCD-12)'s (I think)

The 4 Kenwoods just replaced the existing speakers.  I don't think I 
have to tell you where I put the head unit.  :-)

I mounted one amp in each wheel well, and the Changer in the right wheel 
well (with the amp that drives the Kenwoods) since it runs cooler.
The boxes are then velcroed to the trunk floor (so I can move them 
when I need the space) and attached to the frame with heavy cable (to 
meet insurance criteria).

Another option is to lose the spare tire and build a framework into the 
space left.

The biggest problem with the 944 is that the trunk floor is the fuel tank 
so you can't bolt anything to it, the rear seat folds over, so you 
probably don't want to mount anything onto the back of it, and the sides 
are curved, angular, and a real pain to mount something on, at least if 
you want it to look professional...

Two other pitfalls, before mounting anything in the wheel wells make sure 
you don't have water leakage problems as it collects there.  And secondly 
 if you are running a big system (and it sounds like you are) and your 
running it loud: you may want to install vents and fans into your wells, 
as the circulation is poor; this is relatively easy to do.

Let me know what you end up doing, as I am planning an upgrade would be 
interested in your solutions.
Good Luck
Dave
