Subj:	Brakes and rotors

Hi All,

	I would like to put in my $.02 on brakes and rotors. I agree with 
everyone that the brakes are easy to do. When I purchased my 951 I had to
replace the brakes,rotors and then the rack. My question is why do you have to
bleed the brakes. When I have performed the brake job on both my Porsche and 
red beater truck all I did was push the pistons on the brake calibers back into
position. Because the brake reservoir may overflow (if someone has added fluid
as the brakes wore down) it will have to have some liquid drained or sucked
out. I guess another way to do it would be to open the brake bleed valves
and drain, if this were to be done then you would have to bleed the system.
Also most parts houses sell a "One Man "Woman)" Brake bleeder that works 
great. It cost about $7.00. I just used one on my truck. Good Luck

David 951 Burg.
