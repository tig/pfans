Subject: Even more questions about my '87 944

Now that I have had a chance to check out more of my '87 944, I have a lot
more questions I hope you can help me with...

1) I am rebuilding the switches for the power seat.  Has anyone else had
much luck with this repair?  I have the switches apart, and am    going to
clean them with electrical contact cleaner tomorrow.  Any suggestions to
make them work well, or if they don't work, where    to get replacements?

I have the same car with a power seat that has only the headrest seat-back
part of one of the 2 4-way switches out. I posted an inquiry up here about
it, but it may not be something that others have had trouble with. As I
understand it, the 4-way switches are hard wired to the entire harness.
they cannot be replaced without replacing both 4 way switches with the
attached wiring ($195 from Porsche, YOW!).
I though I might hard-wire another switch into the wires to bypass the
problem switch, but the wiring seems a little complicated (it goes through
a relay as well).
I think the best solution might be to scrounge the wrecking yards or bite
the big one Porsche.

Good luck!

Kurt
