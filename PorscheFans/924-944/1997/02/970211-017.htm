Tom,

I think part of what you're seeing is a regional difference in pricing.
I've noticed that 944's go for quite a bit more here in Seattle than in
other parts of the country.  I've watched the market for over a year and
the only turbo S that I have seen advertised locally for under $15,000
was a charitable toad.  

I paid $12,000 for my '86 turbo (granted the car had a lot of money
spent on recent chassis mods and was also the cleanest 951 I had ever
seen) and yet there was already a back-up offer for $12,500 before I
wrote the check.  Interestingly enough some other cars, such as BMW
2002's are generally much cheaper up here.
