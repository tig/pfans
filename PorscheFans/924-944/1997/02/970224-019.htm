Point taken, but FYI, all Volvo 2 and 7 series are RWD.  Only the 8 series
is FWD.  Granted, a brand new 850-R is an appealing target, but an
innocuous 2 series will pass largely unnoticed.  In some cases it is often
the driver of the car, and not the car itself, that can make a difference.
Carjacking is random and it is difficult to attach any logic or pattern to
it, but--and I do not intend this as a sexist remark--a woman driving a
nice or expensive car alone is often perceived to be a more appealing or
"easy" target, sadly, and we must take this into consideration.
