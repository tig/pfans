"Disclaimer, I have a large financial interest in this"

Whoever said "parts is parts", never owned a Porsche.  A certain unnamed shop
(yellow 944 racer on the cover) offered to sell me a set of stiffer valve
springs for $900.  My builder found an after market outer spring that will work
with the stock inner springs for $8 each and he does not have to machine the
head to make them fit.  Cavet emptor.

My engine builder tells me not to give away too much information on the
Internet.  Ha!  I can hardly find two water cooled experts in the country that
will agree on anything and he is worried about giving away secrets as if anyone
would listen.  Or that anyone else would be foolish enough to be doing what we
are to a four banger engine.  Secret:  Our piston, rod and wrist pin weigh in at
1369 grams.  The challanger (stock setup) weighs in at 1604 grams.  The nice
folks at Andial will not tell me what theirs weigh.
