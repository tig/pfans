WARNING!!!! The "Cup Car" discs I refer to below are not more expensive than 
the OEM parts.  Don't buy a Euroselect throwout bearing!!!!!!!


THIS IS A REPOST.

Some things I've learned about 951 cluthes:

(i)     There seems to be only one current factory part for the clutch disc. 
        It is the same for all 951's.  It has four large springs, and a
        secondary damper plate with six small ones.

(ii)    Regarding above, the six small springs have a habit of breaking
        long before the clutch is worn out, eventually causing the clutch to
        fail to release.  I have a "like new" '89 951, and these rascals just
        broke in December at 26k miles!!!

(iii)   I've put "cup car" clutch discs in both my cars.  I have the Sachs and
        Porsche part numbers for those interested.  The dealer does not sell
        these discs.  The key differences from the current factory part are (a)
        only the four big springs are present, id est , there is no extra
        damper plate with springs to break off; and (b) the friction material
        and method of bonding seem different.  After having two clutches
        prematurely break their springs, I'll never use the current factory
        type.  The "cup car" type can be had for the same price.

(iv)    In my '87, I had a Euroselect kit installed, which failed after five
        months.  Upon inspection, the throw out bearing was the culprit.  When
        I compared it to the normal factory part, I noted a SIGNIFICANT
        difference in quality.  I got reimbursed for the bearing and bought a
        factory unit.  There may still be some Euroselect kits out there even
        though the program was eliminated in favor of the current PPE program.
        I'd STRONGLY recommend against using the clutch disc and throw out
        bearing from one of these kits.

******* REPOST #2 ********



As stated in previous posts, I have the "Cup Car" clutch disc in both of my 
951s (an '87 and an '89).  I can't yet comment about a downside compared to the 
Factory parts.  I'd suggest a call to Engine Builders Supply or Windward to see 
what feedback they have gotten from customers.

The following parts numbers were on the box containing my discs.  Please note 
that I attempted to verify that a number of suppliers/advertisers were selling 
these same part numbers as "Cup Car" clutches.  I got 2-3 of them to confirm 
the numbers, although they were hesitant.  The discs typically run about $225.

SACHS part number: 1861 944 433
Porsche Part number: 951 116 011 09

Again, these parts are not available at the dealers.  Near as I can tell, the 
other factory clutch parts (pp, throwout and pilot bearings) can all be used 
with this special disc).

Happy Driving. Spring is coming, and we're all getting geared up for autocross, 
touring and the Big Track.
