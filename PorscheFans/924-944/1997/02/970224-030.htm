Hi all,

I'm trying to use the tension checking tool to measure the tension of my timing
belt.  There isn't really any room for the flat parts of the tool to fit
between the timing belt and cover.  I have to move the timing belt down a
little to be able to fit the device on the belt (I'm measuring on the area
between the cam-shaft and the idler pulley.

Am I suppose to remove the idler pulley to get an accurate reading from the
d!%? guage?

This thing is really a pain in the ass.  Especially with the dang auto-tensiong
device.  I can't seem to reliably get the tension of the belt set properly.

Anyone have any tricks to doing this.  So far I'm re-connected the battery and
have used the starter to spin the engine (I've removed the ignition relay),
then I turn the engine by hand to TDC, back off 10 degrees and try and measure.
 So far every measurement has been different, reading from 2.5 to 7 on the
gauge.  I think the biggest problem is that the dang gauge doesn't fit between
the back cover and the belt.

I'm trying to get 4.0 on the guage (new timing belt).  I've gotten it once, but
then I turned the engine a few more times and the reading was 7.

Argh!
