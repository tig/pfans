Thanks for all the help I received regarding the speedo problem on my 83
924. I now have a couple of questions which I hope to get some help on?
1. The electric passenger window will go down with the passenger side
switch but not back up !  but it will go up from the drivers side, this
only happens if the window is taken beyond half way down up to this point
the passenger side works fine.
2.  The fuel pump seems to keep running all the time when the engine is
running making a horrible whine, surely they weren't supposed to sound like
that ?
3. I also have the starts fine when cold and difficult to start when hot
problem, but a mod has been done in that the headlight washer button on the
centre console is wired to a junction block in the injector area this seems
to over come the problem allowing the car to start when its hot, I'd like
to fix this problem properly any idea on what needs changing.
4. I have a pair of lights in the front bumper which seem to be driving
lights, but the area I live in fog lights would be very useful also, I
beleive these where available to coordinate with the driving lights, does
anybody have more details on these.
5. I don't have an owners handbook for this car, how do you release the top
part of the rear seats to carry more of the usual rubbish I seem to end up
carrying ?
Considering I bought this car for towing my race bikes to tracks around the
country, I'm having so much fun how could I have ever considered a 4x4. and
its probably a better tower anyway.
Regards
Sheridan....
