	I think I just answered these questions. Generally, it's as
	much of a committment as you want to make of it. At the very
	least, it's more of a committment than one normally makes
	to a "car". Let's face it; if you just needed some transportation,
	you wouldn't be looking for a Porsche. So you obviously have
	at least a little something else in mind. Repairs and maintenance
	follow directly from how many miles you put on the car. If you
	don't drive it much, your bills will be cheaper. The one year
	warranty would be great as 100K seems to be the time when lots
	of things like shocks ($1000), water pump ($900), clutch ($1300),
	etc. like to go out. Those things could put a real bummer into
	your Porsche thrill if you had to pay for them. If you put 10K a
	year on it, I'd say your maintenance should average out to about
	$800 a year averaged over several years.

	My SO who has driven a number of stick American and Asian imports
	cannot drive my 944 at all. I mean, at all. Learning to drive
	a 944 is like learning to drive all over again. You may have some
	problems here though it isn't anything that can't be learned with
	some practice.

	I would *love* to see a Consumer Reports write up of the 944.
	That would be a real hoot! The MR2 is not even remotely in the
	944's class so don't bother. If I were you, I'd either buy a
	944 or a Volvo. Of course, I'm biased.

> PS...what kind of MPG do they get?

	I get about 23 and 34.
