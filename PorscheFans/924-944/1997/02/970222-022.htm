I see a lot of Volvo owners coming out of the closet.  While my dad had many
engine problems with his new 760 (back in 198X?) and ended up selling it
back to the dealership in less than 8 months for another Mercedes, I still
thought the car was pretty cool.  Volvo's are definitely unique and have a
lot of character, which is more than I can say for American sedans and the
vast armada of Japanese Mercedes wannabe's.  The Volvo's boxy shape is
classic and easily recognizable, and the company seems to know what its
customers want.  I like how Volvo's are not trying to be something else-
they're just being Volvo's, which is something that commands respect and pride.
        While I'll admit they are probably safe cars, I will guarantee they
aren't safer than a Mercedes (or even a current BMW).  Remember it was
Mercedes who pioneered ABS and was the first to incorporate side impact
airbags.  They also offered standard dual airbags when American drivers were
more interested in steel curb feelers.  I just don't care for all of the
hype about Volvo being the safest car in the world.  It's great that their
advertising and marketing strategy has made the name "Volvo" synonymous with
"safety," but it's also interesting to note that Volvo's aren't even the
safest car in Sweden!  That title has belonged to the Saab 9000 for the past
few years in a row.
        I truly admire Volvo's ability to balance tradition and modern taste
in their styling, and their machines are wonderful examples of technology
and innovation.  They are also not afraid of building engines in some rare
but perhaps more robust configurations.  I'll take a straight 4, 5 or 6 any
day before I'll drive a V-6.  (Speaking of bold engine designs, I seem to
remember Volvo offering a turbocharged model in the 1980's that was NOT
intercooled and required one to cool the turbo by idling the car for a few
minutes before shutting the car off!)  In any case, I'm looking forward to
seeing their new coupe on the road... from the rear view mirror of my 951
that is!
