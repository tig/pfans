You know I never can understand how some people can go through life with
such large chips on their shoulders. The mear mention of someone's ethnic
background or skin color is not necessarily a slam.  I should probably not
get involved with this but I was the originator of the message the EHSMITH
enclosed in his posting. My email was a private one to Georgeb and I admit
that I did write that the woman selling the car was Asian. I did not mean
any disrespect by that, I only was conveying my experience. I believe the
EHSMITH was trying to do us (the list members) a service as it seems he has
had dealings with this woman and believes her to be disreputable. Maybe he
got a little carried away (I don't personally think so) but the fact is that
relaying that she was "Asian" was just a description of the person to allow
others who may answer that email ad to recognize her and to be on their
toes! I personally lived in an Asian country for 3 years while I was in the
service and I thoroughly enjoyed the country and the people. I hold no
prejudice or malice against any group of people due to point of origin or
race. I do however have an issue with individuals or groups of individuals
who are so insecure and petty that they believe that every reference to them
is a slur. Grow up, we live in a nation of many ethnic diversities and we
can not function very well if we look for hidden meanings and/or slams in
any reference to us. I also think that that individual showed a decided lack
of maturity in his response, so I guess if this is the "men's room", then he
must be lost. Oh, by the way if we lost points for spelling and grammar in
this list we'd all be in negative numbers. Incidentally I believe "Duuuh and
then I go ahead misspell a Korean car's name." should have the conjuction
"and" between ahead and (theres that word again) misspell. OOPS!, I guess no
ones perfect are they?
