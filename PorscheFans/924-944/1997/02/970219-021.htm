Hi All,
        Mike Mackenzie and Eric Taelman have a little thread about boost
loss in their 951s and possible wastegate leakage.  I've seen a number of
these wastegates (including my own) with  pretty badly cracked valve seats
inside.  No doubt exhaust gasses will leak through these cracks (decreasing
boost) and eventually burn the valve as well.  
        As Mike noted the cost for a complete new WG is exhorbitant and
tricky Porsche doesn't sell components for the WG separately.  I have a
good machine shop near me (they're into turbocharged dragracing
motorcycles!) bore out the cracked seat, put in a new one and do a one
valve valve job.  Works great, it lasts and only costs about a hundred bux.
If the valve is already badly burned, the problem is tougher. It's a
special valve with the stem threaded at the top to screw into the actuating
diaphram. I haven't had to face this yet so can't propose a solution.
        Another potential WG problem to be aware of - The valve guide in
the WG is some kind of ceramic material. I had one where this material
actually cracked, and a piece broke off.  The piece was too big to pass
completely through the open valve, got stuck and held the valve partially
open.  In this state the engine could hardly develop any boost at all. 
This was a TOUGH one to diagnose as you might guess.  Obviously didn't
figure it out until had torn everything down and taken the WG apart. I had
a spare WG so didn't try to replace the guide.  I'd sure try it though
before buying a new WG.
        Hope this info is helpful.
