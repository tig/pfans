Tony,

Make sure that coolant does not run into clutch bell housing, for the 
bellhousing is open at the top and directly below this valve. Damage can 
occur to the clutch disc and other clutch components. Many, many clutches 
have been replaced due to this leaky heater valve. A modification can be 
made that changes the location of this valve. I do not know the bulletin 
#,  can anybody help on this?

Good luck

Mike Kehr
