> HELP !!
> I've just recently bought a 1979 - 924 and I'm setting about bringing it
> back to it's former glory. Unfortunately time and numerous owners have
> taken their toll on a lot of the bolts.  For instance I just went to
adjust
> the door and found that all the Internal Hex head screws have been
> converted to internal rounds.  Obviously previous owners did not  possess
a
> set of correct sized owen keys.
> 
> The problem I have is that the screws are internal hex (some are actually
> twelve points) that are counter sunk.  They appear to be made out of an
> alloy so the usual trick of welding another bolt to it, to get it out
wont
> work, also because they are counter sunk I cant hacksaw a slot into them
> and get them out that way.  
> 
> Have other readers encountered this problem ? How do you get them out.
> 
> Any suggestions can be mailed direct to indi@castle.net.au
> Thanks in anticipation
