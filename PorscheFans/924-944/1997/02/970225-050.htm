A few summers ago my first car, an '83 944, was totalled when another driver
forced me off the road when he swerved into my lane.  I applied the brakes
(no ABS) to avoid hitting the other vehicle, but lost traction on the
remnants of winter sand application and the looser shoulder pavement.  After
a bit of fishtailing, my tires gave up and as I turned into the final skid,
my car spun around on me 180 degrees and ended up slamming into the cable
guardrail at over 50 mph (The skidding slowed me down from around 73 mph-
speed limit was 65 mph).  When the dust had settled, I noticed that my
passenger and I were unscathed.  We were both wearing seat belts so I didn't
expect us to be that hurt, but we didn't even have a bruise or cut!  We both
walked away from the wreckage and examined the scene:  my car had pushed the
guardrail in by at least 5 feet, and had uprooted the nearest 3 posts.  The
cables had cut into the fenders and one was caught precariously in the rain
gutter above the passenger side door.  Nothing had penetrated the cabin, and
as a testament to Porsche's strength and excellent build quality, I was able
to drive away from the scene once the tow truck freed us from the guardrail!
In actuality, the car was "totalled" from an insurance standpoint only, but
believe me when I said the car was MESSED UP!

My friend once rear-ended a Jetta in a parking lot while he was foolishly
adjusting his stereo.  He was going slow enough that his Probe GT's airbag
didn't even deploy, but the Jetta was totalled- looked like it was hit at
over 50 mph and not 12 mph!
        Simply put, Porsches are tanks.  I feel safer in my pre-ABS,
sans-airbag 951 than I would in any other car out there.
