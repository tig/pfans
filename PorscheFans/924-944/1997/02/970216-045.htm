HOW TO FIND A GOOD CAR?
I will be a first time Porsche owner and am looking for a 944 Convertible
with low miles and I'm not sure where to look for 'quality' cars.  I tried a
dealership that I thought had a good car, but their price seemed to be high
and there was strong resistance to allowing me to take it to my mechanic.
 Also, the dealership did not have any of the owners records.  I don't mind
paying a premium, but I want to know that it is really a good car.

HOW TO KNOW IF IT IS A GOOD CAR - i.e. what to look for?
Any tips on what to look for?  I.e. has the timeing belt been replaced if
>50,000 miles, etc.

PRICE?
What is a fair price for these cars?  How important is low miles.

Any help you can offer would be appreciated.  Please call if you like at
(630) 588-9052 or send me an e-mail at Yohan8@aol.com.

Jon Lindberg
