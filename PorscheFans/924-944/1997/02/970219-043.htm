I could just as easily say this about virtually ANY Porsche.  In many =
ways
they too are (expensive) hunks of junk.  They also happen to be great fun
to drive and that is why enthusiasts put up with all their =
idiosyncrasies.
Maintaining them is a lesson in frustration and big dollar repairs.  Some
of the engineering, or lack thereof, in these cars is simply amazing.  =
For
instance, the infamous 911 chain tensions... 30 years in the making... =
951
clutches that self destruct in under 30K miles and cost $2K to replace.
The list goes on and on.

I for one am glad I have my Honda.  At least I can count on it running,
and running well, each day I drive it.  In over 5 years and 89,000 it has
cost me virtually ZERO for repairs outside of the normal maintenance =
items
such as oil, filter, plugs, valve adjustments, etc.  This may be an
atypical experience, but it is still a lot better than your average
Porsche, which is one reason Porsches (with the possible exception of the
911) have miserably low resale value.

Don't get me wrong, I love Porsches and hope to have one some day soon.
But I'll also have my Honda in the garage when I need it.

BTW, before you swear-off  Japanese cars completely isn't it true that =
the
Porsche factory used Japanese expertise to help produce the Boxster at
"reasonable" costs?
