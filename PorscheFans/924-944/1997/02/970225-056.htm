Spiro,

>I'm looking to buy a 944 Turbo.

I'd be interested in how you made this choice without knowing anything
about the car.  This is not an easy choice to make.

You can start here at the Porsche Classifieds page sponsored by

I have a gazillion notes saved on the subject of 944 turbos.  Pick a
subject and I can probably help.  About a year ago my oldest son was
interested in one.  He didn't get his, but his younger brother did.  The
bottom line, as with the purchase of any Porsche, buy the newest, nicest,
most well-cared for car you can find within your price range.  That won't
be an easy task, so take your time.  Do not under any circumstances let
your emotional feelings get the better of your judgement, or you could =
pay
dearly in horrendous repair bills.  These cars are wonderful when they
work and can break the bank when they don't.

The latest Excellence has a market report on 944s, so you might want to
pick that up.  I wouldn't hold the prices listed as gospel since any
really nice car can cost thousands more than the listed prices, although
you can find a bargain now and then.

As George B. always says, "Good luck!"
