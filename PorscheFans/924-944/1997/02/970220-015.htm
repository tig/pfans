"Ted asked if I checked the gauge to make sure it's ok"...


	Yes, we did that, too, but I forgot to put that in the
	original message. The gauge checked out ok and the temperature
	anomaly was verified externally with an infrared gun. 	The
	difference between my upper and lower radiator hoses was 85
	degrees Farenheit while the difference between all the other
	944's in the shop at the time was about 25 degrees. My shop
	is theorizing that some sort of restriction to the flow of
	coolant is taking place somewhere but we have no idea where.
	I have a nasty, nasty suspicion though; if one were to put 
	Stop Leak in one's radiator because of a very slight coolant
	leak from the radiator, could that stuff some how form a 
	ball of gunk in the engine somewhere and cause this problem?
