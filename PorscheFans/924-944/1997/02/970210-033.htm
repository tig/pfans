About a year ago I replace my steering rack. I followed all the instructions.
After the job I took the car in for an alignment. The only thing not explained
was a center point to the rack. After the alignment the car driffted to the 
right a little bit. The shop that did the alignment is good (my opinion).
My question is does the rack need to be centered. Also does anyone have 
experience with doing their own alignment. Looking at the mechanical side
there is not much to the adjustment. Usually the caster does not have to
be touched unless you replace the lower assembly. That leaves the camber and
toe. The only problem I see is to make the measurement.  (big problem).
What do you racers do? I noticed on page 95 of the latest "Excellence"
magazine a company called "Smartproducts" out of Redwood City, CA. (USA)
two tools the Smartcamber and a Laser Toe Gauge. These items are pricey
$200 for the camber gauge and $750 for the Toe gauge. I know this seems a
lot but I know I have spent at lease that much in the last 12 yrs of 944
ownership, and probably would have done it more offen it they did not
charge as much. When I had my 85 4x4 S10 Blaser I was charged $44.95 for
a lifetime alignment. They see a Porsche drive in at it is $167.00 each
time. (Sorry for venting). Just asking. Thx

David 951 Burg.
