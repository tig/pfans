I assume you mean the "first" position, not the off position. The "first" 
position is where you are supposed to be able to latch and unlatch the roof
for removing it, the second position is for raising and lowering the roof (and
is also the run position for the engine).

Mine does the same thing. When I first got the car, the sunroof worked just
fine, but after several months, it no longer worked in the first position.
To remove my roof, I have to be in the second position, and when I lower the
roof the latches just keep on going until they are completely in the recessed
position. The big problem is I have to watch it when I just close the sunroof
so I don't go too far, just to the closed point.

I don't know where to look to fix this either. Oh yeah, the sunroof sometimes
doesn't move at all. I have to just keep trying, and then finally it will
raise. It always closes on the first try though.

I don't know if the two problems are related or not. I sure would like to
figure this out, but I haven't had the time to dig into this.

Any ideas?
