Ron,

>1) I am rebuilding the switches for the power seat.  Has anyone else had
>much luck with this repair? 

Nope, the little ball bearings keep poping out.  Call George B at (800) 
ALL-P944 and get yourself a used one.

>2) In the front middle of the sun roof, there is what appears to be a
>switch that is activated when the roof is closed.  What is the purpose   
>of this switch? 

This switch informs the car that your roof is in place.  There is no immediate 
reaction. (notice if you replace the sun roof with the car off, and then just 
start it, about 15 seconds later they engage... It is this front center switch 
that lets the car sense the presence of your roof.   Many people have problems 
with the contacts, causing the roof not to open or close.  You can clean them 
if this problem arises

>3) There is a connector near the rear of the engine, by the CO2 test pipe,
>with three pins in it.  

No help.  I had one too. Never did figure out what it was for.... Even had the 
Porsche manuals but never checked

>4) I think the throttle return springs on my car are screwed up.  There is
>a threaded hole for what should be a "idle set screw", but mine doesn't

Again, No help.

>5) My cargo "shade" won't retract.  Does anyone have a repair procedure for
>this annoying problem?

You can drill out the rivits and replace the spring if you want.  End caps are 
available from Porsche

>6) Where is the switch that activates the hood lamp?  The lamp checks out
>but the it doesn't light when I open the hood.

Try turning the ignition key to the on position

>7) Are the windshield washers really *heated*!  I think so... COOL!

Yup.

>8) The cruise control is weird.  It works, but sometimes it stops reacting
>(won't resume or set a new speed) after coming to a stop.  The car has to

The cruise control on 944 series cars is notoriously suspect.  Mine, and many 
others developed gremlins to the point of uselessness, or even worse, unchecked 
acceleration.  Either try replacing the brain with George or an expensive new 
one from the dealer, or just don't use it.  IMHO they are very dangerous.

>9) Has anyone retrofitted the rear wiper onto a car without it?  Mine

Never done it, but I'll bet George B has all the parts for a very reasonable 
price.

>10) Hmm.. I guess I have to start keeping a written list as I have

Half the fun of a PCar (again IMHO) is that you not only get to drive a great 
German car, but you eventually become one with its innards...

Usual Disclaimer.... George B is IMO a great guy with a great business to which 
I have no financial connections....
