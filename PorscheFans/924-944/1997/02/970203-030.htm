Hi everyone, Spring is upcoming and some of us may already have scheduled
some recreational Porsche motoring.  I am always keen on improving my loyal
little car and have had some aftermarket products put on it.  Some of them
great but others are just a waste of money.  If you have experienced some
performance upgrade(s) which you think very worthwhile or downright
garbage, please share with me and all other 944 owners in order to save
ourselves some money.  Remember the key word is value-to-the-dollar.  The
products I have used or am using are as follows:

Weltmeister throttle cam + K&N:
Recommended.  The cam does not make any BHP improvement but the initial
throttle response is improved significantly.  The filter directly fits into
the air filter housing (not the cone type)  K&N claims BHP and fuel economy
improvement which I cannot verify as my trip meter is dead and I have not
done a before & after dyno test.  Cost is US$90 approx. ava. from
Automotion.

Exhaust system:
My car's OEM muffler is replaced with a Aero-Master high flow muffler using
which they had experience in gaining HP for many local made cars.  I took
the risk as it's much cheaper C$130
(material only) and its a stainless steel unit.  I then bought a 4"
stainless steel resonator tip, had my cat. converter replaced with a pipe
resonator, and had the entire exhaust piping upto cat.
converter replaced according to original spec.  The result, undesirable
sluggishness at low end while free flow at mid & high end rpm.  The car is
now with deep sound at idle and low rpm and actually quieter at mid & high
rpm.  Despite the feeling and sound, there is no noticeable HP nor speed
improvement although it cures the rattling problem.  I am not satisfied
with this setup and do not recommend it.  Costs are C$130 for muffler,
C$120 for exhaust tip, C$100 for the piping.

Spark plugs:
I am using Split Fire platinums in my 944 and find that they do give
improved throttle response to the car.  The condition of the old spark
plugs, Bosch Super, when taken out was in good shape, ie. brown colour
without noticeable electrode wear.  Cost is very high compared to other
spark plugs but then again we are only talking about a few dollar extra per
plug.  Cost is C$12.50 each.

Transmission fluid:
Because of the low ambient temp. in Alberta, I switched to use Castrol
Syntec SAE
75W-90 transmission fluid three months ago.  I still have a very hard time
to switch into a gear when the car is cold.  I do not feel any improvement
at all.  It's a waste of money.  Cost is C$8.5 per litre.

Engine oil & additive:
I use Tufoil for my minivan and slick 50 for my 944, both of which are
Teflon based.  It is stated that Tufoil can protect your engine for temp.
as low as -18c during cranking stage.  It the place you live is colder than
that, don't expect any miracle.  While not getting any noticeable fuel
consumption improvement as claimed, the engines of the vehicles do run
quieter.  This leads to my belief that the two products can reduce internal
engine friction/wear.  Some studies show that Teflon products can 1)
generate acidic substance which accelerates the aging process to
seals/gaskets and 2) block oil filter.  I cannot comment on 1) as I have
only used Teflon products on each oil change for about a year or so.  I
don't extend the duration of oil change just because of using the products.
 So far, I have not experienced any seals/gaskets problems.  For point 2),
I do closely monitor the colour of the oil at each oil change but there is
no evidence that the oil changed is significantly darker as mentioned in
some studies.  (Note: Porsche AG does not recommend oil additives)
