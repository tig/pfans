That's funny because when my son bought his '89 951 last August our local
credit union loaned him $17,500 on the car.  This credit union is pretty
conservative, and bases their loan values on NADA book values I believe.
Anyway, I'm wondering why this loan amount apparently doesn't jive with
the apparent "going rate."

Thanks for all the info Ted.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Unfortunately, =
up
here in Seattle there aren't too many for sale.  Those that are tend to =
be
high-priced in really nice condition or medium priced but in lousy shape.
=46or instance, last summer I looked at an '89 in our local area that was
available for $15K.  I really had bad vibes about the seller and we
passed.  I later found out it was eventually purchased by a local Porsche
repair shop and the new owner got stuck for $10K in repair bills.  Lucky
us I guess.

I also had an '89 inspected in Atlanta.  The car sounded nice over the
phone, but it turned out to need quite a few items, bringing the estimate
to repair to over $5K, plus the $16K asking value.  Another pass.

I guess you *can* find nice cars for under $15K, but our search didn't
find any at the time.  As it turned out the car my son actually purchased
was located only a couple of miles down the road from us!  In 4000 miles
of use it has had zero problems (knock on wood), used zero oil, etc, and
astounds me every time I drive it <g>.  It co$t a lot, but hopefully it
will prove to be a decent value over the long haul as we will probably
keep it in the family for quite awhile.
