Thanks for the input.  I wonder if anyone has talked to the Yoko service 
people about pressures for these tires.  That seems like pretty low pressure 
but....if it works....If anyone has any more info, I'd like it.  Have had good 
success with Yokes in the past and would like to go back to 'em if they've got 
a good one.

I have an update on my experience with the new Yokohamma A032 race tires
for anyone that cares.

I am running 205/50-15 on a 15x6 front and 225/50-15 on a 15x7 rear on a
73 911 with rather large torsion bars.  Still needs bigger and adjustable
sways.  I used them last October at our Drivers Ed at Roebling Road in
Savannah, and came away with a not so favorable impression.  I spoke to
some people, no one with yokohamma, about what was happening and what they
thought might be the problem.

I started out with the tires at 28psi front and 32psi rear.  I think that
was where I used to run my old 008's, I can't find my old notes anymore. 
The theory we came up with was too much tire pressure.  They would be fine
for a the first 4-5 laps, but would then start losing their grip.  We
thought that as the tires came up to temp, the pressure got too high.  My
co-driver used the car at a drivers ed at Sebring about four weeks ago,
and used lower pressures and he thought the car felt much better.  I ran
the car in the PCA race at Sebring this past weekend, and I used 22 front
and 25 rear, and the car felt great.  I never felt like the tires lost any
grip in the dry sessions.  I was also impressed with the traction in the
wet.
