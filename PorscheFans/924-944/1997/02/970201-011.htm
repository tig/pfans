On my car, I pulled the carpet down to get to the braces that hold the
"brain" in place.  Then unbolt the braces to get to the metal box that holds
the chips.  A thick wiring harness and a hard plastic tube runs to the box.
 The plastic tube that screws into the top of the box is the suspected
problem.

Before pulling your carpet down check the tube and make sure it is not
pinched are broken.  On my car it hooks up to a fitting on the intake
manifold between the #3 and #4 intake runners.

I found the tube OK.  The problem with my car was were the tube connects to
the intake manifold there is another line that runs forward to a fuel
pressure regulator and then all the way to the front of the engine
compartment to a valve(?) next to the radiator reservoir tank.  This valve
was broken and any buildup of manifold pressure was leaking out of this valve
instead of being read by the KLR chip.
