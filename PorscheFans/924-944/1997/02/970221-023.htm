Ok, I am by no means an expert on this car, but when I got my water pump
changed, the dealer changes my t-stat with the new Porsche issue unit
and my car ran warmer than normal.  To figure out what was causing the
car to run hotter than what I had come to expect (I didn't know it was
the t-stat at this time), I started to do some numerical testing.  I
feel that this is the best way to find a problem is to break everything
down into pieces and record what's happening and at what temperatures
(in this situation).

First thing, beg, borrow or steal a pyrometer.  I used an infared one
borrowed.  Let the car idle, the rad should be cold.  When the temp 
needle comes to the middle (with the 80C t-stat), the radiator should
start to get warm and then finally hot.  The temp can climb as much as
3/4 way between the two middle marks before the fan comes in.  Once the
fan comes in, the temp will almost immediately start dropping.  If the
ambient temp is low, the gauge will go down to the 1st 1/4 mark.  If it's
warm out, the temp will stay dead center or a little below.  Once the
rad temp comes down, you will feel it go cool once again and the temp
will start to rise to 1/2 and then 3/4 OF THE MIDDLE two marks.

This is the proper cycling of the cooling system.  This tells you that the
radiator is working, the water pump is pumping, the t-stat is opening,
and the fans are working and turning on at the right temperature.

Now, with my car, Porsche has changed their t-stats to 83C t-stat.  This
makes quite a difference in temp on the gauge.  This unit along would
make my temp go up to the second line under the overheat zone.  When the
fans kicked in, it would go to the middle.  I was not happy with that
because I HATE OVERHEATING!!!  So, the dealer replaced it with the
old temp unit and all was well.

So, first thing is to start measuring temperatures at the rad when the
coolant flows through and the hoses that go to the rad, etc, etc, then
people will likely be able to help you out better.  You'll probably find
something really obvious like the coolant flows through the rad at 80C,
but the fans aren't kicking in until 90C (I'm making these up) so you
know the fan thermoswitch is at fault or there is something blocking the
coolant flow around the switch.
