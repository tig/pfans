I am off to California next weekend and every time I have driven there
(Oakland, SF) my 944 has been broken into. Both times no major damage was
done, but I kicked myself thoroughly for not arming the security system.

I need to know where the soundbox for the alarm is (high beep-beep,
incredibly loud and annoying, not the horn). Recently the audible alarm in
my car stopped working. I know the control module still works because when
I open a door/hatch/roof/hood with the alarm on I can hear the relay
behind the sereo (where the control module is) clicking for about a
minute. The alarm used to go off for one minute, so I am sure the computer
is doing its job.  Also, when I try to start the engine with the alarm
on, it shuts the motor off.

I suspect the piezo/speaker/horn-type-thingie is either bad or has a loose
connection. Just don't know where the heck the thing is among the maze of
neatly sorted amp, cruise control, stereo, radar detector wires up the
driver's side foot-well. As far as I remember the sound did come from the
driver's side, under the dash. Please remember this is the older factory
alarm with no motion sensors (armed with a seperate key on the left
quarter-panel), and the control unit is above and behind the stereo.

Hoping somebody will be able to help keep my Porsche from unworthy hands
this weekend!
