Thanks, I made contact with European Dynamic Technology today, and discussed
their arms. They sound good,  and I will be using them. I have the classis right arm
power steering fluid soaked front bushing, so was interested in someone who could
also replace this, along with ball joint. I normally travel to Houston on business, so
I will drop them off.

Hi,

I just had my control arms replaced. I asked for the workshop to use the guys
down in houston after I received several good recommendations from people on
the list. The arms cost $150 each, they have a warrenty (they date stamp the
arms). I saw the arms when I took my car in and they looked great. I had my
engine mounts changed at the same time and the car feels and drives so much
better.

Regards,
Robert Boxall.
