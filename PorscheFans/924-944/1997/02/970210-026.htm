Nick -- if you have the '84 cluster (boxy) here's what you do to switch
the tach with the speedo:

1. Take the wheel and blinker/brights/cruise + wiper/washer stalks off the
steering column. =20
2. Take the cluster out as far as it comes. =20
3. Unscrew the speedo/odometer cable from the back of the speedo. =20
4. Unplug all electrical connectors from the cluster and remove it.
5. Reroute the odo/speedo cable to come from the right. This was fairly
difficult for me because the cable is very rigid and there is little room
to maneuver. You will have to get under the dash and work the cable out of
the metal speedo housing behind the cluster, and work it back in to the
right of the housing, where the tach electrical connectors usually are.=20
5. Take the cluster and put it face down on something soft. Push the
speedo and the tach out from behind, gently and evenly. Switch positions
and push them back in the cluster.
6. Put the cluster back. Squirt the odometer cable with some light grease
where it connects to the meter. Connect the cable, and other electrical
plugs. The odometer and speedometer plugs are interchangeable (ground and
two bulbs each) so you will not need to stretch any wires. The odometer
multiplug wires will have to be folded back and routed from behind the
metal speedo housing, where the odometer cable came from, to reach the
odometer now.
7. Test everything and put everything back together. I also changed all
the instrument/warning light bulbs while I had the cluster out, to preempt
any blown bulbs. There are 4 replaceable bulbs, 7 bulb+holders (in the
temp/fuel gauge) and 1 big replaceable bulb for the alternator warning
lamp. Also cleaned all connectors with an aerosol cleaner and everything
seems to be brighter. Of course I had 100k miles on these bulbs so maybe
you will not need to do this. Be careful when reinstalling the horn pad --
the plastic grommets break unless you do everything slowly and evenly.
Don't forget the washer under the wheel. Good luck.
