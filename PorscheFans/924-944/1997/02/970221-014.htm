Well Jay,

I'm a computer modeler of atmospheric pollution by trade, so I'm definitely 
sick and twisted.  As a herder of electrons, I've gained a healthy distrust
of anything indicated purely by electronics without the benefit of real
physical measurement.  Are you sure your 944 is really too hot?  Seriously,
your temp gauge might be whacko.  My 931 has separate sensors for the fan
switch and the temp gauge.  You've tried the fan switch swap-out, now how
about the temp gauge sender, meter and related wiring?  My Mazda pick-up just
experienced such a failure.  It would not warm up properly no matter how many
times I changed the thermostat.  Finally, it would not pass the annual state
emission inspection because the temp sender was telling the "electro brain"
that the engine was not to operating temperature and was maintaining a rich
fuel mixture.  A $7 temp sensor finally cured everything.  

Bottom line: computers are really dumb beasts, at least at the present.  I'm
sure our porschefans list warden will agree.
