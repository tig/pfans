Probably shouldn't dignify this with a response but so as to not offend our 
Asian listmembers, I wasn't sure if this woman was Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. 
so I characterized her as Asian woman, so the CAR in question could be 
specifically identified.  Sorry if I've offended anyone, not my intent and no, 
I have absolutely nothing against Asian women or any other women. 
 
Point being that this person, whatever color, race or creed, is lieing about 
the car and other cars she is selling. 
 
This does not in anyway constitute an apology to the un-named antagonistic 
respondent who doesn't deserve one. 
 
Ted
