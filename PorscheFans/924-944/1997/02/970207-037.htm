Make DAMN sure the click click click is not the pinion bearing.  If it continues
you'll take out the R&P + all gears.

The CVs usually humm and the pinion clicks.  If the pinion bearing is
clicking you'll nee a new transmission CASE..not cheap.

Yes this has happened to me which is why my current pinion bearing is
pinnned (rather than press-fit) in place.

Hi to everybody,

I have to say that I am very impressed with the tecnical knowledge
this group shares.  I think I am in the right place :)
I am in the market to purchase a '87 951.  Does anyone know
any good machanic (knows 951 really well) in the San Francisco bay 
area where I can take the car to for a complete checkup?  
The guy offered me a good deal on it but I noticed several 
problems already.  

First, I think the rear CV joint is gone because 
I can hear "Click, Click...." from the rear.  I guess it 
doesn't really matter which way I turn to figure which side
has the bad CV joint since it is a rear-wheel drive. Correct me if 
I am wrong.  

Tom,
