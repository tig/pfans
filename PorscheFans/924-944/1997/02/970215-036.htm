Hello Porche Friends:

I have decided to finally attempt to fix the sunroof on my =9188 924S, so=
 that
I can enjoy it when spring arrives.  I have only owned the car for about =
7
months, and it has never worked, so I=92ve never experienced it working
correctly, and can only guess at what I=92m trying to achieve.  I know th=
e back
of it is supposed to go up and down a little.  Anyway, the motor always m=
ade
noise - for about 3 seconds in position =93A=94, and then it would stop. =
 Then it
would make noise for about 3 seconds if I rocked to position =93B=94.  Ne=
ver any
movement on the roof or the levers that obviously are supposed to raise a=
nd
lower it.  So I removed the cover and examined the motor, and adjusted
(played with) the plastic tensioner, or whatever it is attached to the ca=
ble,
just inches form the motor.  No difference.  So I then took off the insid=
e
headliner trim and exposed the latch mechanisms, and then took them apart=
 and
found the obvious problem of the nylon gears on both sides with all the t=
eeth
broken off the small gear portion of them.  So I=92m off to the dealer on
Monday to try and get these gears, but, now when I activate the switch, t=
he
motor only moves the cable in one direction, retracting it toward to the
motor in the rear of the car.  Moving the switch in the other direction
produces nothing, and thus I=92m afraid when I put it all back together, =
it
will still do that and either just close, or just open (I=92m not sure wh=
ich
way causes it to do either).
  Does anyone have any ideas on this?  Is there something that makes the
motor stop and allows it to go the other direction only when the gears an=
d
roof are in place?  How far out should the cable be when I put the thing =
back
together?  I=92d hate to get this all together with new gears, and either=
 strip
them right out again, or have the motor not work right when it was workin=
g in
both directions before.  Any help would be appreciated.  Respond to eithe=
r
the server, or me direct.
