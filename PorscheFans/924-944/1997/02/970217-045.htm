I had the same problesm  on my 85.5 944. I checked everything like you did 
(selenoid, temp sensor resistance value with respect to temperature, heater 
valve, etc.. ). It turned out to be a small piece of plastic (actually called 
plastic bearing) holding one arm controlling the heat exchanger flap. It`s 
under the dash right above your right leg when you`re driving (you`ll see two 
long arms on the side of the heater control box with white small plastic 
bushing). Those are the culprits ... around $3 for both.
On mine when I was having this overheating problem I could move the arm up/down 
while driving (not a confortable position let me tell you) and it sure fix the 
problem).

the battery), a mix chamber sensor (you have to remove part of the dash to see 
it) and a inside temp sensor with a little fan sucking air through a tube 
connecting to the little round grille in the dash. Those are sending values to 
the main control on the dash (the temp control) which is returning control fro 
the selenoid for the heater valve, etc... 
I won`t mention about all the flaps opening and closing in harmony when 
everything is working fine.
I spent hours looking at this piece of German art :-(. with the help of the 
shop manual otherwise forget about figuring out how this thing works.

 One other thing about the interior temp sensor. Is there a

Hope this helps
