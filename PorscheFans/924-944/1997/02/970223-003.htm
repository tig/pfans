I=92ve been sponging off this list for a while, so here=92s a little some=
thing to
give back.  I just replaced the stock 15=94 steering wheel in my =9188 92=
4S with
a 13=94 wheel.  Let me tell you, the girls are right when they say 2=94 m=
akes all
the difference in the world.  With the old wheel, the knuckles on my righ=
t
hand would always bump into my thigh on hard right turns, and force me to
have to let go of the wheel and cross over to grab the wheel on the top -=
 not
a very natural thing to have to think about if you=92re involved in negot=
iating
a quick turn on a two lane with a car coming the other direction.  It was
especially bad if I was breaking too (yeah, I know you=92re supposed to b=
reak
BEFORE the turn).  But with this new wheel I can actually turn lock-to-lo=
ck
keeping both hands at 10:00 and 2:00.  It also requires far less input on
lesser turns (makes it look like I=92m not working as hard to drive the c=
ar).
 Another thing - this new wheel is actually round, where the old one was
slightly egg-shaped, so when you are coming out of a corner, the wheel
returns nicely and evenly to center.

I would highly recommend this to anyone with a stock wheel on a 924 or ea=
rly
944.  There is one drawback (of course), the wheel runs right through the
gauges.  From my driving position it splits the temp/fuel and tach gauges
right in half, which isn=92t a problem because I still see both the temp =
and
fuel gauges completely, and from about 2k to 6k on the tach.  However, th=
e
speedometer is another story, as I miss everything from about 60 mph to 1=
20
mph, unless I duck my head a little.  So, I=92m thinking of rotating it s=
o I
can see it up to 80 or 100 mph.

If you decide to swap wheels, the retaining bolt is 24mm.
