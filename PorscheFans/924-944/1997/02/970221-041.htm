If the engine is putting out too much heat and is over-loading the cooling
system, then it seems like there's a large range of possibilities you could
explore, such as the ignition timing, possible exhaust restriction, and
abnormal accessory loads.  To make the job less time-consuming, you might 
want to restrict the initial scope of your investigation by accounting for 
the 1) intermittent nature of the problem, and 2) the problem appearing
out of nowhere.

Maybe the oil cooler seals were the real problem, and you haven't
yet corrected all of the problems they caused.  You tried some
solutions before you found the failed sleals, like flushing the 
block, right? Would it make sense to re-visit any of those previous 
solutions, with the new oil cooler seals installed?
