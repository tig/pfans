Either sell the 944T and get a TS or keep the 944T and forget about an
RX-7.  I'll explain why below.

0-60 is all about launch.  Power is good, but launch is everything.  My
AWD 300hp Talon used to run 0-60 in under four seconds.  It would be
very difficult to get a <4 second 0-60 out of a 944T because of traction
problems.  This is not to say it isn't possible with a set of slicks
and tons of power, but then, who wants to put drag slicks on their Porsche.

Turbo Lag is almost non-existant on the RX-7, *BUT* I personally *LIKE*
turbo lag.  One of my future posts is going to compare the different
chips I tried over the last weekend including Autothority 2.7, Autothority
(really old one) and the Turbo Cup computers from Andial.  I won't
spoil my own future email, but the lag-less, smooth power delivery was
VERY, VERY boring to drive.  I much rather preferred the on-off 
sensation that one of the combos gave.  But then, I've only driven
turbocharged cars so I'm used to their unique way that they must be
driven to get the most out of it.  I've actually seen 944T owners that
never go above 4000rpm because they think they are stressing their engine.
It's too bad they stressed their wallet with buying one because they
could have got the same pleasure from buying a Civic.  The higher RPM
you take it in the previous gear the better range the RPM will drop
to get boost in the next gear.

The 944T is a very easy car to drive, the TS is a bit more difficult
and anything with the stage II type chips is going to be more of an
animal to control.  The best way to learn how to drive a car is to
take it to the track or if that intimdates you, go autocrossing,
it accomplishes the same thing.

You will likely need to change the 1-2 synchro.  In modern day transmissions,
you should not have any synchro problems.  Synchro problems usually stem
from the driver (I don't know how you drive so please don't take that as
an insult, just relaying information).  If you damaged a synchro in this
car, you'll likely do the same in the RX-7.  Slow, controlled, precise
shifts is what gives me pleasure, hard slam, spin the tires shifts, only
give the service manager pleasure.

The 944T makes a very good track car.  Have you looked at the potential
problems of the RX-7?  They aren't exactly the pinnacle of japanese
engineering.  Coolant systems that blow up and turn your car into a ball
of flames, aluminum hoods that dent when you breath on them, vacuum hoses
that constantly pop off making you lose boost, frequent engine rebuilds
because of the design of the rotory.  Any dealership that keeps engines
in stock tells you something about their cars.  Can you tell I'm not a fan
of the RX-7?  I'm answering these same questions for a friend of mine who
is contemplating an RX-7 and I think I've got his mind changed.

>If you where me...what would you do?

I would either keep the 88 or trade it in for a 88TS or 89+ model 944T.
If you want a decent japanese car that won't break on you everytime you
take it to the track, try a 300ZX TT before an RX-7.  I dislike both
cars, but at least the 300ZX is robust.  Better than both though for
track duty is the Supra TT, but then you might as well get a 944TS.

Personally, I've had it with Japanese cars.  You take them out to the
track and they can't run 10 laps before the brakes start to fade and
the rotors warp.  Turn the boost up and the cooling system can't handle
the additional load.  Four years after owning them, things start to fall off,
cheapness of materials start to come through, etc, etc.  Some japanese
cars are very good though, Toyota and Honda seem to really know their
stuff when it comes to durability, but the others lag a bit behind.

While reading over the post, I've found that I may come across as a bit
harsh, so don't take it too harshly, but I really have seen too many friends
sell their beautiful cars to buy RX-7's and all have regretted the 
decision.  Ask me about other cars and I might be a little nicer :)
