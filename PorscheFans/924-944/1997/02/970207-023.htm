has anyone heard anything about any damage that can be caused to the
drivelines of the 944s if the rear tires don't have the same amount of
tread?  my father seems to remember reading that if one tire has quite a bit
more tread than the other, damage can be caused to the cv joints or other
components.  we are concerned because the PO of my 85.5 put one uniroyal all
season on with the rest being falkens.  there is a huge difference in tread
grip and life.  we were wondering if that could have caused any problems.
there does seem to be freeplay or slack in the drivetrain now.  any comments
would be appreciated.  thanks
