Hello,

Having replaced my fuel rail components Saturday, I started to feel cocky
enough to take on my stereo. I'm happy to say that I now have updated the
rear speakers on my car. I didn't have the guts to try taking the trim
panel out from under the window trim. What I ended up doing was unbolting
all the screws on the trim panel, pulling off the door jamb weather
stripping, and bending out the panel as far as I could. I used a little
screwdriver to go in through the grille holes in the panel and undo the
speaker screws. This sounds alot easier than it really is. You have to keep
bending out the panel with one hand and unscrewing with the other, the
stupid seatbelt fighting with you the entire time. I checked my speaker
cables with an ohmmeter to make sure they were hooked up right before I
mounted the speakers. I got two mounting screws in each speaker and that
will have to do. It doesn't matter how good or bad they sound (I haven't
wired them to my amp yet) they are going to stay there! The technique of
not removing but bending out the panel was related to me by someone on
the list, but their original message has been deleted from my mail system.
So if you're listening, THANKS! It's all back together now, and doesn't
look any different than before I started. I can't wait to hear how it
sounds.
