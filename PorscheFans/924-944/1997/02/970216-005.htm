Don,
	I've run four driver's ed sessions with my 951. Completely stock except
for R1's.  I had used stock pads but I started to get material transfer
problems from pad to rotor - felt like warped rotors.  I switched to
Hawks(blue I think) at the track and was astounded at the change. I
started running much faster laps. They actually scrubbed the rotors
clean. I was gleefully reeling in a gaggle of shiny new 911's when my
pedal went soft - boiling brake fluid - at the end of the Mid-Ohio's
long back straight. Almost had a 95' 4S hood ornament.	
	My experience - the pads are great for the track - they are noisy on
the street.  If you drive aggressively - OOPS, you have 951 - when you
drive aggressively consider upgrade to 600 C fluid. We had to jumper the
pad wear indicators - the connectors on the Hawks were not the same.  I
am also installing front brake cooling ducts to avoid non-color
coordinated hood ornaments.  Unless something better comes along I'll be
burning up the Hawks at Mid-Ohio soon.


Anxiously awaiting spring in Ohio

Anyone have any opinions on using Hawk brake pads for track events? I
know they have 3 
different compounds...Good experiences or bad experiences would be
appreciated compared 
to Cool Carbon, Performance Friction, Pagid etc.
thanks,
