What you have described is a classic workflow example, and is easily dealt 
with in any of the workflow tools.  I use IDEF0 as the process mapping 
methodology, because it is easy to explain to process experts who no little 
about mapping.  These tools can be combined with workflow automation tools, 
workflow simulators, etc. which can all help the improvement process.

I use Design/IDEF, from Meat Software (web site www.metasoftware.com), who 
also can help with the automation and simulation side as an integrated 
solution.

I'm taking a look at the operations of  a  claims processing organization
with an eye towards improving the accuracy of its electronic payment
process, and would be grateful for recommendations regarding (a) software
for process mapping, (2) references to literature on this subject.

Thanks.

1) Try Innovation and Entrepreneurship by Peter Drucker.

2) The ultimate customer oriented companies are those that build race cars.
The ultimate internal focus are; a) those who build what they enjoy
building, and b) most government organizations.

3) These two are not opposite extremes of a continuum.  Market Driven is at
12 o'clock, Profit Driven is at 6 o'clock, Technology Driven is at 3
o'clock, and Internal focus is at 9 o'clock.

Hope this helps, or at least encourages you to find a better answer.  Keep
us informed.
