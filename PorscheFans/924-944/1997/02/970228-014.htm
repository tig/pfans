Don't Forget Your Dealer!

I have been marshalling my efforts to roundup a variety of new parts for my
car.  I have been searching the usual sources from Excellence, Panorama,
and a few friends from the list.  My list of parts vary from cheap oddball
stuff to some more expensive suspension goodies.  After collecting all my
prices and advice I chanced to stop in my local Porsche dealer for a few
tidbits that were not worth mail ordering.

While wrapping up the small sale I asked if he would quote some prices on
brake rotors, shocks, and other goodies.  As it turned out he was
consistently matching prices with some of the big boy after market
suppliers (when you factor in shipping)!

Some of the stuff was not in stock, but it takes them only three or four
days to get then, plus they deliver to my place of work free.

Although service prices are still somewhat higher than independent shops,
Porsche has made a real effort to bring prices down on their parts as part
of a strategy to encourage their customers to return to the dealer.  This
has been mostly a silent campaign and so has gone unnoticed by most of us.
Furthermore, many of these 'other' parts suppliers are holding stores of
stock that they have purchased before the Porsche price drops.  This puts
them at a disadvantage when prices start to slide down as they have been
recently.

My dealer has taken the approach to be aggressive with their pricing and I
feel those measures warrant my patronage of local business when possible.
There is nothing like over the counter service from an established company
that is still hungry for business and has the resources to back up that
service.  Sure there are a few dealers that drop the ball, and I will not
work with those places.  That is the best incentive I can provide for
better customer satisfaction.

Oh, by the way; Porsche offers a two year guarantee on most of their parts
through the dealer.  That a hard deal to beat.
