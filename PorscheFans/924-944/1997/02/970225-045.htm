Well, first thank you everybody for the info for the control arms. I have now
had both front arms replaced ($150 each what a deal). I also had the engine
mounts replaced, a tune up ......(no more, please :-O ). Anyway, the car drives
great and the vibration is gone. Now I hear the rear hatch make some wierd
noises, but that's another story.



So once again, some more questions.
1. When I am driving really hard and change gear during high acceleration I
often hear a loud high pitched squeal (lasts for a couple of seconds max). I
thought it was the clutch but I can't tell where the noise comes from. I am
begining to think that it is from the back. Any ideas?

2. When slowing down, via the engine, I get another rumbling noise (difficult
to explain) something like what I would assume to be a bearing. If I put the
clutch in it goes away.

3. Since the car has 80K on it and the control arms were shot, what about the
shocks? How can I tell if they need replacing? I intend to take the car to
drivers Ed. and would replacing these be a reasonable investment.

I am going to replace the clutch because I am sure the rubber damper has gone
and I am hoping the the above relate to the this as well.

Thank you.
