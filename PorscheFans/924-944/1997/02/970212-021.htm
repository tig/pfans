Hello All, 

My 83 944 starter won't turn over. When I started the engine it made a
terrible "grinding" type sound, so I shut the car off and when attempting to
re-start the car nothing. Wont turn over, doesn't click, nothing? (but the
lights do dim) At first I thought the worse - seized engine. But you can turn
it over manually. When coming out the next day to continue poking around for
answers I noticed the battery was completely dead.

The car had a new starter put in about 2 months ago. The shop that did the
work claims it's something else and doesn't want to look at it. Saying they
are no longer doing Porsche service since there Porsche mechanic retired the
first of the year.

Any Ideas? Help?
