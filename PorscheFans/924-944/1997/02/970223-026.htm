I am building a motor for my turbo and want to know what I might be missing.
I am having the head milled and O-ringed, baffles installed in the oil pan,
slotted main and rod bearings for constant oil pressure, factory rings,
wide-fire ring head gasket, viton seals, and a K-27 running 1.1 bar boost.  I
am told that this should bring me into the 350hp neighborhood without
mass-flow or 2.8 kit.  I would appreciate ANY suggestions as to better build
this motor.  I plan on using the car only for racing, so the low-end power is
not important to me.  I hear that people are seeing over 400hp in full race
setups, but don't know where the other power is coming from.  I haven't heard
a thing about cam profiles.  I am also adding a 3-bar fuel pressure
regulator.  I was considering the Extrude-hone process for the intake, but
was told that there isn't enough power to be gained there and it is not worth
the $$$ unless you're out for blood.  HELP!!!  I'm trying to get it together
to go racing in a few weeks and am coming down to the wire.  Thank You.
