A while back I posted that my '88 S was experiencing a minor problem =
with the temperature fluctuating between the two white marks, but never =
exceeding the top white mark. The fans seem to come on, and the heater =
blows warm, less than 10K on water pump and thermostat.
 Then the other day, after the car sat in the sun for a while, I got =
back in and took off. As I proceeded down the freeway at about seventy I =
noticed the gauge was near the top mark again. Being somewhat warm in =
the car, I turned the heater control down from the 24c mark to the full =
off position. Almost immediately the temperature fell to just above the =
first mark!=20
I played with it for the next twenty miles, and every time I turned up =
the heat, the  temperature gauge would rise, and if I turned it down, =
the temperature gauge would fall.  Turning on the A/C compressor or the =
defroster had no effect, when the heat was turned down, but would cause =
it to rise when the heat is turn up. When I turn the heat all the way =
off, I here a click, like a relay.
 I haven't noticed the click when I turn the heat up.   So what do you =
guys and gals think?=20
Plugged heater core? I couldn't even find anything about the heater core =
in the Haynes manual. Does it sit right under the fan/blower assemble? =
And how hard is it to get in and out?
 Or should I try and "back flush" the system first?
        Thanks in advance
                                         Otto
