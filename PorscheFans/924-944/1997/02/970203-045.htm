As stated in previous posts, I have the "Cup Car" clutch disc in both of my 
951s (an '87 and an '89).  I can't yet comment about a downside compare dto the 
Factory parts.  I'd suggest a call to Engine Builders Supply or Windward to see 
what feedback they have gotten from customers.

The following parts numbers were on the box containing my discs.  Please note 
that I attempted to verify that a number of suppliers/advertisers were selling 
these same part numbers as "Cup Car" clutches.  I got 2-3 of them to confirm 
the numbers, although they were hesitant.  They typically run about $225.

SACHS part number: 1861 944 433
Porsche Part number: 951 116 011 09

Again, these parts are not available at the dealers.  Near as I can tell, the 
other factory clutch parts (pp, throwout and pilot bearings) can all be used 
withe this special disc).

Happy Driving. Spring is coming, and we're all getting geared up for autocross, 
touring and the Big Track.

Hi there,

 Interesting advice on 951 Clutch:

and

 I'm interested in getting those part numbers.  If the dealer doesn't
 sell them, who do I order them from and how much do they cost?

 I replaced my clutch a little over 100,000 Km (60,000 Miles) ago with
 original Porsche parts and the clutch disc did have the secondary
 damper plate with six small springs.  Fortunately, I haven't had any 
 problems with the clutch yet, but the problems that I read about
 on this list seem to have a funny way of happening to my car, soon 
 after I read about them!

 I was wondering if there are any disadvantages to using the "cup car"
 clutch disc?  Do these clutch discs have a secondary damper plate?
 Do they affect shifting feel or transaxle longevity in any way?  Do you
 use the standard Porsche pressure plate with them?  The reason I 
 ask is, usually, racing parts are meant for racing and you have to 
 live with certain compromises on the street.

 Thanks in advance!
