	Well, my bias is showing, but why are you going to a dealer?
	Are there no good independent shops in your area? I hate
	dealerships. About the pads eating the rotors...could be.
	You do have 81K on your car and I've heard from some people
	that the OEM pads (which you probably have) can be tough
	on rotors. It's possible you might need rotors. If you do
	have to do the job, get an non-OEM pad like the Pagids,
	Performance Friction, etc.

	What a bunch of crap. I deal with this radiator thing
	all the time. Mine has little bitty leaks from time to
	time that my shop and I keep a close eye on. When we see it
	leaking, we crimped that spot again to make sure it's tight
	and this will stop the leak for 4-6 months. Bottom line; unless
	water is pouring out a big hole somewhere, you're ok so long
	as you watch the radiator religeously (you say you do) and
	fix those little leaks when they do crop up. Also, make sure you
	drain and flush the coolant when you're supposed to. The radiator
	can clog up otherwise...
