I spoke to Porsche Cars today on their 800 info. number (800-545-8039).  I
asked if they were planning on making available a means of turning off the
passenger side airbag in their cars that have them.  My two kids will soon
be too bigh for the back seat but too small for the airbag.  They said no.
I sensed that they understood that a number of people would like that
option, but were afraid of the legal implications.  I gather that pending
legislation will require it anyway, and then they'll be off the hook. 
Has anyone looked into this issue further?

I also asked how many 1988 944 Turbo S cars were sold.  They don't have
that number - just the total number of Turbos, which was 1889.  I've heard
that there were only 200 or so.  Does anyone have the exact number?

Lastly, I found it interesting that the 800 phone number took me to a
small office in Laurel, MD - just 5 minutes from where I work!
