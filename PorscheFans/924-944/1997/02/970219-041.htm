>>Reading about all of these heater problems reminded me that my climate
>>control fan switch acts up occasionally.  Every once in a while, I'll switch
>>fan speeds (0 though 4), and the fan won't even come on unless I have it on
>>the max (4) or if I press the defroster button.  This will usually persist
>>for a day, then the problem will disappear.  I was told that it is most
>>likely a case of slightly corroded contacts.  Any ideas?
>
>What you have going out on you is the blower motor resistor.  I had mine go
>out last summer at Mid-Ohio during the IndyCar event.  Sunny, 98 degrees
>outside  with a black leather interior and my A/C on the fritz.  Wasn't fun.
>Now the skinny.  Thought my problem was the climate control unit, but they
>normally don't go bad.  The blower motor resistor is part no. 944.616.101.00.
>OEM new will run you $211.37 (Beaudry Porsche) or used at Parts Heaven for
>$20.00.  I went used and thought I could go thru ten for the price of one.   
>The switch is located under the black plastic shroud in between the battery
>and fuse box in the engine compartment.  Carefully lift off the plastic blower
>motor shroud and your will see a 4" long cable plug going into a 5"long white
>ceramic flat on the right hand side.  There are two screws that hold the
>resistor in.  It seems that high speed (#4) is the default for the only on
>speed and the power is stepped down for the other three.  The theory is the
>ceramic plate holds the stepdown coils in the airflow of the blower motor to
>cool them as they get quite hot when you add resistance to slow the fan (See
>old PorscheFans posts about meltdown of Headlight switches on early 944's when
>you dim the dashlights while driving for hours and build up all of that
>resistor heat.)
>The resistor is easy to replace and should take about 30 minutes max.

>>        Oh yeah, anybody have a spare Air-Conditioning switch (has the
>>snowflake on it) for the dash on an '86 951?  Are they complicated to
>>replace?  Thanks...
>
>My snowflake has worn off, and I'd like to replace it, but an earlier post or
>an article in Excellence had made me aware, if I am not mistaken, that the
>switch alone is in the range of $150-200 plus the time to wire the climate
>control system.  Once again, there is no "easy" fix. Let me know if someone
>out there has a better solution.

>Good Luck!

"Aerodynamics are for people who cannot build engines." -Enzo Ferrari

For those of you who don't see the point in buying
 a car that costs more than $35,000:
"Man knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing." -Oscar Wilde
