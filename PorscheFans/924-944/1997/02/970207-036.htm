I live in the SF Bay Area, too.  There are a few good places to service
your p-car.  First and foremost, I take my car to Bauer Porsche Repair
and Service.  They're in 26th St., Oakland (their address should be in
issues of Excellence magazine).  They are a full-service repair, race,
and performance shop--check out the race results in POC Golden Gate
Region web site.  They'll be more than happy to do a full assessment on
your purchase.  Reittmeier Werkstatt in Los Altos is another excellent
shop.  If you're looking for routine care and maintenance, Vanguard
Motors in SF are also good.  All the other dealer service shops are good
such as Carlsen, Negherbon, and Sonnen are good.  Stay away from Rector
-- I heard too many horror stories about them.

By the way, are you the lucky guy who is thinking about buying that
Sapphire blue 951 that's been advertised in the Examiner for weeks?
