Hello my name is Holger Duus and I just found this site. I'm from
Denmark but for the time now working in Lithuania. Last time I was in
Denmark I have bought a Porsche 944 from 1984 (2477 cm3) which just came
from Schwihzerland. The car looks and drive like a new car and I enjoy
it very much. Here in Lithuania it's ompossible to find anyone who knows
about this type of car so I would like to ask two question for you on
this list :

1) which gasoline will be best for the car to use - I can chosse between
octane 95 with Hg or 98 without Hg.

2) I would like to know more about my car such as horsepower, speed (it
seem to be very fast but here in Lithuania the speed limit is 110km on
the highway and the police is everywhere) and so on can anybody tell me
where to search or perhaps tell me.

Thanks   
Holger
