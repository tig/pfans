Hi,

Can anybody please help me. I am in the UK and have owned a '79 924 for
the last year. I have tried everything I can think of to solve a warm
start problem. The car starts from cold after a few turns no problem. I
t will start from hot (10-15 mins after stopping) straight away.

If I leave it for 20 min to 2 hours, it rarely starts. If I turn it over
constantly for a minute or two, it will eventually fire. When it does
fire, it is clean and runs perfectly.

It does not seem to be affected by weather conditions, the problem has
stayed all year round !!

I have spoken to people over here who say it is just one of those things
with early 924's.

Is it ??

Any help would be much appreciated as I have to re-charge the battery
every 2 to 4 weeks.

Thanks in advance

Gary
