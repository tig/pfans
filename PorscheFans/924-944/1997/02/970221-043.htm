My '84 944 does use a brake pedal activated switch for the brake lights.

At the risk of nagging (!), how do I "backflush" my radiator? I realize it
implies flushing in the opposite direction, but since I cannot stick a
hose in the tiny drain plug on the radiator. . .? To test you guys'
patience once again - I usually flush by draining the coolant and running
water through the expansion tank filler hole and out the drain plug (lower
left corner of radiator). But now I am worried about the coolant I have
had sitting in there for the last 6 months because I recently discovered,
accidentally, that it has phosphates. I need to do a thorough flush of the
radiator, heater core, block, w/pump and hoses. Please help.

Also, does anybody have any experience with Mintex pads? A friend has them
on his '83 944 and likes them. Apparently they are "semi-metallic"
whatever that means, and are a nice compromise of durability and hardness.
Also cheap ($30 from Vertex I think). Anybody love/hate them?
