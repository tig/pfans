I can think of  two possibilites: 1) for corner balancing the car (equal
weight on each pair of tires; can also [normally] be done by adjusting the
suspension); ultra trick suspension tuning. The negative of using an "anvil"
is, of course, that you add weight. 2) I'm not familiar with any specific
club that does this, but it could have been to meet a minimum weight
requirement (or I guess to handicap although 50# would seem strange).

Oh, a third thought...if it's hollow, watch out for men wearing dark
sunglasses, cheap suits, and driving plain looking sedans.  :-0
