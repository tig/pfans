Start with the 98 octane gas, then experiment with the 95 octane gas. If 
you have no problems with the 95 octane, you should be fine.

Your car 120kW (163 bhp) and a top speed of 137 mph (220 kph). Zero to 
100 km/h took 8.4 sec, and a kilometre from standing start took 28.8 sec.

This information from a Porsche tech specifications book.
