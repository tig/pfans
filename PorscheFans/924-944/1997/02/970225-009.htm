     I realize it may sound a bit crazy,  but I've been researching the 
     possibility of installing a Nitrous oxide system on my 86 951.  I've 
     submitted my reasoning so that maybe someone can point out where my 
     logic has failed. 
     
     The car already has the Weltmiester chip and wastegate shim and a 3" 
     exhaust (cats still in place) and will do 0-60 in the low 5sec range 
     (as measured by a G-tech pro). (The car also has braided lines, cool 
     carbons, and high temp fluid)
     
     My goal is to increase power to the 300-320hp range and get 0-60 times 
     down to around 4.8 sec.  
     
     I do track the car sometimes but it currently has plenty of power to 
     get me into plenty of trouble. So track oriented performance gains are 
     a low priority.
     
     I want to retain the car's drivability and do not want any increase in 
     lag.  Thus big turbo fitments are less than ideal.  Consensus on mass 
     flow sensors is that they are not worth the money.  
     
     This is why I thought of nitrous. A conservative kit is rated at 
     adding 50hp. Plus the power gains that come from the "intercooling 
     effect" of  nitrous. Which is the equivalent of adding a huge 
     intercooler with no loss in pressure or increase in lag. Additionally, 
     nitrous virtually eliminates lag by filling in for the turbo at low 
     rpms and at the same time increasing exhaust pressure to spin-up the 
     turbo faster.  And when I don't want/need the extra power I can just 
     disarm the system and return the car to the current, more reliable 
     state. 
     
     Of course if it were that easy everybody would use it so I was pretty 
     skeptical. There are a few problems, most of which modern technology 
     solves:
     
     First, the Nitrous gets used up. The kit comes with a 10lb bottle. It 
     costs $3 a lb. to refill the bottle. So there is incentive to only 
     stress your engine/driveline when you really mean it.  However, I 
     would guess a big turbo & MFS lowers gas mileage significantly. When 
     you use the highest octane gas available (as we all should), I imagine 
     the costs from lowered gas mileage all the time with a big turbo and 
     the use of nitrous some of the time pretty much even out.  
     
     Second, Nitrous comes on instantly. So if it is not used in 
     conjunction with a nitrous controller it may place too much of a load 
     on the engine's internals at low rpms. A nitrous controller releases a 
     variable amount of  Nitrous proportional to engine speed. 
     
     Third, If too much nitrous is used or too much spark advance, there 
     will be detonation. Again a nitrous controller can solve this problem 
     by retarding the spark when the nitrous is activated. As a back-up 
     system, our cars are already equipped with a two-stage knock-detection 
     system that will retard timing 3 degrees at the first sign of 
     detonation and by as much as 6 degrees if knocking persists. 
     
     A Nitrous kit and a controller can be purchased for less than $1000. 
     Getting the same amount of power in traditional ways would cost two to 
     three times as much. Plus the car is easy to return to stock if you 
     wish to sell it or race in stock classes on the weekends.  
     
     Obviously increasing power decreases the life of  the engine. What I'm 
     considering here is the difference between Nitrous and some 
     alternative way of decreasing the life of my engine.  Basically the 
     internals of my engine don't know the difference between 300hp that 
     comes from a big turbo and 300hp that comes from a shot of nitrous. 
     Except the fact that the thermal loads are a lot lower with the 
     nitrous.  So it is no worse than a big turbo, probably better in fact, 
     more performance,  not used all the time, and much cheaper. So It 
     seems that as long as a Nitrous controller is used (VERY IMPORTANT) 
     Nitrous is a good, albeit rather unorthodox, option.  I do realize 
     that my clutch will need to be upgraded, but I expect that the 
     transaxle should be able to handle the extra loads as long as I do not 
     abuse it too much.  
     
     By the way, I'm not a drag racer. And I am fully aware that installing 
     Nitrous on a fine work of German engineering is quite blasphemous. 
     However, I do have a nasty addiction, the symptoms of which you have 
     already seen. So perhaps this is a cry for help. 
     Am I Nuts?
