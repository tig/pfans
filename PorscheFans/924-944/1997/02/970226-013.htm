Since you were very helpful with my sticky solenoid, I ran out and checked
my car's height :)  With it sitting at the lowest setting (there is perhaps
1 thread showing on the height adjustment), the car is 24.5" with a tape
measure touching the ground and going through the center cap of the wheel
to the fender lip.  The rear sits at 25.0", but this number I've found
is dependant on how much fuel is in the car.

Paul's car sits at 25.0" up front and 24.5" in the rear with 1/2 tank of
gas.  Mine was measured with 1/4 tank.  I would estimate that a stock car
would be about 1-1.5" higher all around, especially in the rear.

The boys over at Weissach Performance said that they stopped doing that
after 1989.  All 1990 and later cars had the standard VW handles with no
Porsche inscription.  Mine have the Porsche lettering dug in.

Whether this is correct or not, I don't know, but that's what they said.

Good to hear!

If the car has been sitting or a while, oil settles all over the place,
and will need to come out.  I think all 911s also do this when sitting
for some time.  What you may be seeing is also rich smoke which is usually
a dark gray/black color that comes on under boost.  If it continues to happen
on a daily basis, then I would start to look at rings.  It's unusual for
a turbo to blow blue on acceleration because when the seals go, the oil
comes into the turbo under vacuum and puffs it out, unless it sucks it into
the compressor side in which case you could have it under boost too.  So,
check rings and turbo.  That wasn't of much use now was it :)

I can almost guarantee you that it is rich smoke.  I would think that Andial
would run the car rich with that kind of a setup with the K27 and all.  Even
my friend's 1 bar chipset runs really rich and spits out black smoke under
WOT.  Under part throttle, your 02 sensor takes care of the mixture, under
WOT, the O2 sensor is ignored and voila, black smoke.  It's pretty much
harmless, *but* excessive richness can wash the cylinder walls down and reduce
the ability for the oil to lubricate the rings, leading to ring failure.  Both
of my race Talons had this problem, but we had to run them that rich to prevent
detonation.  Excessive richness can also clog a catalytic convertor pretty
quick (RX-7TT are notorious for this), but the 944 Turbo uses a very cool 
cat bypass under WOT through the external wastegate so I wouldn't think there
would be a problem there either.

Get someone to ride behind you when you mat it and watch the color and tell them
to smell (make sure they are a good friend because if it's oil, they'll 
probably be sick for a while).  Richness has a very distinctive smell,
almost like something from a different planet.  Oil has that telltale smell
which is easy to see and smell.

Richness is, oil is not.

[Regarding air bags de-activation]
NHTSA is proposing that the owner would have the right to deactivate the air
bag if they so pleased.  The proposal is at 
http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/deactnpr.n21.html

I personally do NOT like air bags and am glad that my 89 Turbo does not have
them.  I hope that I don't regret that opinion, but having an explosive device
pointed at my face and my short body scares me more than bonking my head
against the steering wheel.
