Farzaan made an excellent post about trying different chips and banjo bolts in
his TS.  I hope he and his pack do well on their trip south.

He mentioned Goodyear GSC tires.  What was your (or anyone else's) experience
with them?  I'm currently running a set and have been happy with them for street
use.  I had Dunlops which stuck real well but picked up every sharp object
within a 10 mile radius.  Next came Michelins which were too hard and did not
hold well on fast corners.  We have run the GSCs on my friend's S2 in two auto-x
events.  They work fairly well but we are interested in other's ideas on tire
pressures.  We ran 36 front and 32 rear last time.  I wanted to let the rears
down to 30 but ran out of practice laps.  Shoe polish on the sidewalls next
time.

As a side note, I agree with Wes, flaming should be on the flaming list.  Capt
Squid (long story) is on my header but I always sign my real name.  This is an
excellent list composed of a great bunch of guys. We can keep it that way by not
responding to those taking shots at our list members.
