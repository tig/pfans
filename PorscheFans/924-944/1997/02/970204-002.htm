Greetings from the german autobahn!  I'm a new subscriber to this list, but
I have had my 1986 951 for over 5 years.  I have experienced a sudden loss
of power and and accompanying "pop" which occurs when I accelerate hard
while cruising between 80 and 100 mph.  The car doesn't cut off, and when I
get off the gas, then then reengage it lightly, I can resume driving and
have no problem getting the speed up to about 140 mph (we travel rather
briskly over here, but I rarely drive 150mph...only if I'm in a hurry).  I
can accelerate as hard as I want up until about 70-80 mph.  After that I
have to be extremely careful.

I've been told that I have a compression problem, which (I'm told) is common
in 944/951s with roughly 120,000 miles on the odometer.  I have 127k on
mine.  Has anyone out there had or heard of a similar experience?  Am I
gonna lose my shirt trying to repair this?  Please advise...I need help.

I can be reached by e-mail at:  raifordk@heidelberg-emh11.army.mil  OR by
this list

Post Script:  I have read messages from folks considering buying a
water-cooled Porsche.  Dispite this problem I am experiencing, I can tell
you that there aren't many better choices.  Don't believe the myth that
Porsches don't make good daily drivers.  I have been using mine as a daily
driver since 1992, during which time I have driven it back and forth to
work, as well as from back and forth between Fort Bragg, NC to Washington
DC, and to Arizona and back.  Not to mention all around Germany for the past
3 years.  I would only trade my Porsche for a newer Porsche...and even that
take a lot of thought.
