I'm wondering.. It seems that almost all 944s here in Norway have their
dashes intact. Actually, I can't recall seeing any cracked 944 dashes at all.
Almost all 924 dashes are cracked, ofcourse. Are 944 dashes made from a
different material than 924 dashes? I see that Auto Atlanta sells 944 dashes
over $100 cheaper than 924 dashes for some reason. Or could it just be that
because 944s are so expensive here, buying a new dash isn't too much of an
investment compared to the value of the car?

Oh, btw: Will an early 944 dash fit a 924?
