     1) There are two openings that are in the bell housing.  The one that 
     seems to be the biggest problem is located on top of the bell housing 
     (near speed sensors ( that one has a nasty habit of getting leaky 
     coolant from the heater valve on some models (causes premature pilot 
     bearing failure due to degreasing of bearing))), and the other is 
     located by the slave cylinder (near bottom of bell housing on drivers 
     side).  Water will not pool inside of the bell housing, however, the 
     latter opening may lead to premature slave cylinder failure if too 
     much dirt is able to get into the opening.  There should be a plastic 
     plug for that opening.
     
     2) There is a vent on the transaxle located at the top.  There should 
     be a small plastic cap that keeps water from dripping into the small 
     opening on top.  If the transaxle was submerged (I do not know the 
     details of your water problems), it might gain access there.  When has 
     the transaxle fluid been last changed?  You could drain it as a 
     precautionary move and examine the fluid for contamination.
     
     Good luck,
     
     Marv

     Hey guys,
     
     I have two specific questions if someone could answer (by private 
     email
     too because I'm on digest)
     
     1. Are there any vent holes for the transmission fluid in the 
     transmission?
        I just want to make sure that no water could have gotten into the
        transmission.
     2. The clutch inspection hole, is it directly facing down or is it up 
        somewhere where water could become trapped inside?
     
     Thanks,
     Farzaan (still sorting out the water mess).
