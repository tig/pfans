I did mine with the Haynes manual and I agree that it leaves a lot to be
desired. Much later, during a tech inspection for a drivers ed event, my
mechanic felt that my right front wheel bearing was a little loose. The
method he used to tighten it was exactly the one described in the Haynes
manual. The problem is that if you haven't done a bunch of them, you just
don't have a feel for the correct adjustment. Actually, I came pretty close,
but will probably do better next time.
