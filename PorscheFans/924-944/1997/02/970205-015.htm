Mystery of Model Numbers
......
 You will often hear of cars you did not know existed, or
find parts with odd part numbers.

Each porsche project number is unique to model, but many parts are
interchangable.

Example:  You may find 928.xxx part numbers on your 944.  Since the
motor is 1/2 of a 928 motor, some parts have 928 part numbers as they
were origianlly developed for the 928.

Some parts will have 477.xxx part numbers as they were origianlly
developed for the 924 when the project was for a new VW.  Examples
include the rear torsion tube housings - all the way through 928
models!  The front hubs also carry a 477 part number up through '86.

Some parts are VERY cheap - i.e. the A-arms and Ball joints since they
are from a VW Rabbit.

My 911SC has many 930 part numbers since some parts (like the fan
shroud/engine block/valve covers) were originally modified and put into
production for the 930.

On the other side of the coin, there are cars you may not have heard of.  
Porsche people often refer to cars as the project number, rather than what 
what porsche calls the car.  You may also find these part numbers on newer cars.
Interestingly enough, the new 911 twinn turbo carries 993 part numbers,
and apparently did not generate a new development sequence. 

Examples:
901 = Early 911. Part number changed becase of interference with Puguot's 90x series
904 = Unibody alumnum/fiberglass race/street car.  4cyl/6cyl power.
906 = Carrera6 race car
907 = Similar to 908
908 = Similar to 906
910 = similar to 908
911 = Say no more!
912 = 911 with 356 style motor (NOT VW!)
914 = VW project 914
916 = Race version of 914
917 = Evil Lemans car in many configurations rangine from 12cyl normal (500HP) to turbo (1600+ HP)
924 = 924.  Originally 477 as VW project.
928 = 928
930 = 911 turbo
931 = 924 turbo
934 = 930 modified for racing
935 = HEAVILY modified 930 - tube frame full race.  Part numbers starting with 935 $$$
936 = Open sports car derived from the 907 for LeMans/Endurance prototype
944 = 944 (derived from 924)
951 = 944turbo - derived from 944
956 = Short wheelbase prototype derived from 936 - first Porsche monocoque race car
959 = derived from 911 - you have to know this one!
961 = Gruppe B / Lemans race version of 959
962 = Slightly larger 956, driver moved back with feet behind fromt wheel centerline
	(Won lemans allthrough the 1980s and agina in 1994 as a street car!
964 = 911 Carrera 4 and later Carrera 2 and C2 turbo
968 = Modified from 944S2/951. 928 style headlights
986 = Boxter
993 = Current 911
996/8? = 911 under development for intoduction in 1998
