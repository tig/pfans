I am having a problem with the boost on my '89 951.  I have had the 
car since May of '96 and the boost has always been there when I wanted 
it.  Two weeks ago I failed emission tests here in GA.  I took it to 
the dealer who made some adjustments and the car passed easily.  The 
only apparent change was that the idle went from about 1000 RPM on the 
first inspection to about 720 on the second (this is what the digital 
readout on the inspection machine said not the tach).

Leaving the inspection station a happy man I tried to have some fun 
and noticed that the boost gage never went above 1.2 or so.  I made an 
appointment with the dealer who could not accommodate me for several 
days.  Being a daily driver, I noticed that the idle crept up to 1000 
RPM now and again but I dismissed that and figured the dealer would 
put things as they were before they monkeyed with it so that it would 
pass.  I checked this list and based on postings here checked all of 
the vacuum lines - they were OK.

I took it back to the dealer who made about 30 minutes worth of 
adjustments and test drove it.  Things seemed to be fine.  Two days 
later the idle started fluctuating between 1000 & 2000 RPM on short 
trips (engine not at operating temp).  If I applied the brake and let 
out the clutch it seemed to pull the idle down but never back to 1000 
where it has always been hot or cold.  Finally, today I was on the way 
home from work and again, I got no boost beyond 1.2 BAR on the gauge. 
 In an effort to figure this out I turned on and off every electrical 
component to no avail.  So, at the next stop sign I turned off the 
engine and immediately restarted it; Magic, turbo boost again.  What 
gives????
