On my '87 951, the original gasket let go at about 75k miles (September).  The 
car has the Milledge race chips, and runs about 1.1 - 1.2 bar of boost (the PO 
was a race driver in boosted IndyCars).  Anyway, I did the job myself.  One 
hint when reassembling is to lower the head into place with the manifold 
already bolted on.  It is hard to get the manifold on when the head is in the 
car.  I used the wide fire ring gasket, and fresh Porsche gaskets throughout.  
Well since that first repair, I've had the head off twice more.  It keeps 
seeping at the rear, near the number 4 cylinder.  I've consulted many experts, 
and it appears that the head surface is smooth and flat, as is the deck (engine 
block surface).  Of course, each time I've gotten better at the procedure, but 
I've used up a lot of gaskets.  The head does not seem to have any cracks or 
other defects.

I've heard mixed info on the factory studs.  One expert believes that you 
should replace them every time, because they stretch when torqued into a yield 
condition, and can no longer provide enough clamping force after they are first 
used by the factory.  The Raceware parts are highjly recommended as a 
replacement alternative.  The deal with the studs is that it is supposedly a 
bear to get them out.  The factory used a Loctite threadlocker compound that 
requires heat to break down.  I've been told that this is really a tough, tough 
job.  I am anxious to hear from frequent poster Clark Archer as he proceeds 
with his project.  How are you going to heat the block/studs Clark?  Did it 
work?

This has been a frustrating project for me, although I have my '89 951 (27k 
mile car!) to rely upoon until the '87 is fixed.  My new theory is that the 
seepage is coming from a poor seal at the heater core water outlet pipe, 
located at the rear of the head on the driver side.  I can see water leaking 
down the block underneath it and onto the floor.  Maybe the water is traveling 
around to the passenger side, which is why I see it near the number four 
cylinder.  The car isn't blowing white smoke, so maybe its just a coolant leak 
to the outside world.  This is really a frustrating problem, that has so far 
stumped the experts.

Clark: send me an e-mail if you wish to talk about this...
