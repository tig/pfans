Hello P-men,
  I've got a cronic problem with the heater on my 86 944. Sometimes I can't
turn it off.  The heater valve in the engine compartment seems to be working
properly but sometimes there is no vacuum to pull the valve off. I found the
vacuum solenoid and temp sensor behind the glove box and all looks ok there.
I also found what looks like the remains of another temp sensor under the
hood next to the battery and blower motor. Does this have anything to do
with the heater? One other thing about the interior temp sensor. Is there a
hose that goes from the temp sensor to the small slotted disc in the dash?
Mine doesn't have one. Any help with this will be appreciated. I've had this
problem for a couple of years. It even overpowers the A/C. If I can't fix it
by summer I'm going to wire the heater valve shut. When all else fails,
Bailing Wire!
