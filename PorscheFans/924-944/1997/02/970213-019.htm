Now that I have had a chance to check out more of my '87 944, I have a lot
more questions I hope you can help me with...  

1) I am rebuilding the switches for the power seat.  Has anyone else had
much luck with this repair?  I have the switches apart, and am    going to
clean them with electrical contact cleaner tomorrow.  Any suggestions to
make them work well, or if they don't work, where    to get replacements?

2) In the front middle of the sun roof, there is what appears to be a
switch that is activated when the roof is closed.  What is the purpose   
of this switch?  It can be operated by hand when the sun roof is out, but
doesn't seem to affect anything.  Maybe it isn't a switch and    it's just
my imagination? (It sure *feels* like a switch when I press on it!)  Maybe
it is supposed to prevent the sun roof "arms" from coming back out when the
roof isn't in place?  My arms will come out when the roof isn't installed,
BTW.

3) There is a connector near the rear of the engine, by the CO2 test pipe,
with three pins in it.  It doesn't have any cover on it, but looks as if it
should.  Is mine missing the cover, and if so do any of you have a parts
car with the cover you'd sell me?

4) I think the throttle return springs on my car are screwed up.  There is
a threaded hole for what should be a "idle set screw", but mine doesn't
have a screw in it.  The throttle cable itself seems to be holding the
idle.  Also, there is a "coil" spring for throttle return, but it's linked
to another, straight, spring.  This "straight" spring seems to be
stretched, and the throttle doesn't seem as eager to return as it ought to.
 Once again, if someone has a set of these springs, I'll buy 'em.

5) My cargo "shade" won't retract.  Does anyone have a repair procedure for
this annoying problem?

6) Where is the switch that activates the hood lamp?  The lamp checks out
but the it doesn't light when I open the hood.

7) Are the windshield washers really *heated*!  I think so... COOL!

8) The cruise control is weird.  It works, but sometimes it stops reacting
(won't resume or set a new speed) after coming to a stop.  The car has to
be turned off and restarted to bring the cruise back to life.  Also, is it
supposed to "resume" after you push and release the clutch?  This is handy
when the engine is lugging along at 45, and you need to downshift. 
However, if you shift to neutral, the cruise will race the engine trying to
increase the speed of the car. This doesn't seem right to me, or is it just
a quirk with the 944?  My 280ZX clears the cruise if you push the clutch.

9) Has anyone retrofitted the rear wiper onto a car without it?  Mine
doesn't have it and I'd like it.  I see the hole is there with a plug, and
the mounting bracket for the motor is there, but no wiring.  Does anyone
have the whole thing from a parts car, with the wiring maybe?  (wishfull
thinking, I like it to be OEM)

10) Hmm.. I guess I have to start keeping a written list as I have
forgotten a dozen other things.  I guess that'll do it for now.  I'll be
busy with this car for a while, I can tell.  Thanks in advance for any help
or information you can provide.  This list is GREAT!!!
