Just saw Bruce Anderson's Market Report on 924-944-968 cars in the latest
Excellence.  The prices listed for 944 Turbo cars seem awfully low for =
the
1989 model year, which was only worth around $14,500 in excellent
condition.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could actually purchase an '89 951
in excellent condition for less than $15K.  If they can, I'd like to know
where :-)  My son paid over $20K for his last summer.  Admittedly, his =
car
only had 37,531 miles and was nearly flawless, but this still seems a lot
more than the "going rate."  If the prices listed in Excellence don't
reflect the real market, what good are they?
