As a reply to the two 944 owners who are having problems with sunroofs
unlatching fully istead of just closing:

My 944S had that problem when I bought it a couple months ago. I looked
behind the carpeting on the driver's side of the hatchback area and took
off the black plastic protector cover to uncover the sunroof motor.

After many miles of driving or poor hardware design, the two SMALL bolts
and nuts that hold the white plastic adjustment sliders (for lack of a
better word) had worked themselves completely loose (one nut was actually
MIA) and so the sunroof was then completely unadjusted--the latches didn't
know where to stop when just closing so in my case, too, they just
retracted all the way.

Anyhow, I tighten everything up and tested the roof a few times, moving the
white plastic sliders here and there until the roof worked fine--then
tightened it all up for good. Now it works.
