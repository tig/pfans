Sounds to me like everything works fine with your roof !! No problems !

A few weeks ago I had my first roofless ride (it's still winter over
here... I had to put the heater at max !). My front-windshield was a little
dirty, so I tried to spray it... no water... I only recently filled the
water-supply... (and recently fixed a leak in the tube... had gotten stuck
between the hood) This is impossible ! I thought I had the perfect 924S...
nothing broken, everything perfect... and then this doesn't work anymore...

I took me a few hours to realize that it was simply deactivated because the
roof was open ! (I didn't double-check this or tried to find the switch,
but since I have the roof back on everything's fine again)

Anyway, I think you can figure out yourself why it is deactivated ! :)

It only lights when you have your headlights turned on... But while we're
at it: does anyone know where the h*** is the switch that turns on this
hood light ? I want to connect my alarm installation to it so that they
can't open my hood... I really can't find it !

> 7) Are the windshield washers really *heated*!  I think so... COOL!
A pair of wires runs to both of the nozzles... I guess it's heated ...

I fitted one on my previous 924 1983... it had a hole too (I don't think
it's worthwhile when there isn't a hole yet...).
Anyway, there are only 3 contact points on it: one for a permanent +, one
for permanent mass and one that runs to the switch in the console and is
connected to + too when you turn on the switch. It's very simple...

And while we're at it, does anyone know why the original switch has 3 wires
connected to it (instead of just 2) ?? I recently replaced my rear wiper
switch with one of a 911... that's one that pops back automatically, you
can't leave it on... Since I only want the wiper to wipe once when I press
the button, I found this more logical. Anyway, the 911 version has only 2
contacts, the seller said it wasn't possible to install the switch in my
924S... He was wrong, it's real easy ! 1 of the wires simply seems to do
nothing at all... I simply let it hang there.

Happy driving !
