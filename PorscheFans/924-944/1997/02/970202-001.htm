Read your email.  Regarding engine oil, you can read some detailed stuff in
the web site "http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/2195/snakeoil.html" which
also mentions engine oil additives, mineral oil and sythetic oil.  I have
read more than a few arguments for and against oil addtiives (especially
Teflon based ones) and sythetic oil.  Upto now, I am still unable to have a
conclusion.  However, I can share what I experienced so far.  Mind you, I
live in a very cold place (this year's lowest is -38c).  

Transmission fluid:

Because of the low ambient temp., I switched to use Castrol Syntec SAE
75W-90 transmission fluid three months ago.  I still have a very hard time
to switch into a gear when the car is cold.  I do not feel any improvement
at all.

Engine oil & additive:

I use Tufoil for my minivan and slick 50 for my 944, both of which are
Teflon based.  It is stated that Tufoil can protect your engine for temp.
as low as -18c during cranking stage.  It the place you live is colder than
that, don't expect any miracle.  While not getting any noticeable fuel
consumption improvement as claimed, the engines of the vehicles do run
quieter.  This leads to my belief that the two products can reduce internal
engine friction/wear.  Some studies show that Teflon products can 1)
generate acidic substance which accelerates the aging process to
seals/gaskets and 2) block oil filter.  I cannot comment on 1) as I have
only used Teflon products on each oil change for about a year or so.  I
don't extend the duration of oil change just because of using the products.
 So far, I have not experienced any seals/gaskets problems.  For point 2),
I do closely monitor the colour of the oil at each oil change but there is
no evidence that the oil changed is significantly darker as mentioned in
some studies.

In regard to engine oil and addtitve, I think it is a matter of religion
but it is true that Porsche AG does not recommend the usage of additives.
