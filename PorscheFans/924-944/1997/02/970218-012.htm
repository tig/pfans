Wyatt,

I had a similar problem with my 931 after adjusting the ignition timing.  I 
cranked the thing until I was affraid the starter was going to melt.  I checked
all the usual suspects; plugs, wires, fuel pump, etc.  Turns out the coaxial
cable that connects the spark box to the magnetic trigger on the distributor 
had shorted out between the center wire and the grounded shield.  Turning the
distributor had damaged the heat brittled insulation on the coax cable.
I had no spark trigger from the distributor so I had no spark.

I think it took me a number of days to find this one!  If you've been adjusting
the ignition timing lately, you might want to check for this cable short.
I just fiddled with the cable until it worked and then sealed the damaged part
with epoxy so it would not flex and short again.  The only official remedy was
to replace the complete engine wiring harness at $800 or so.  The trigger cable
was not available as a separate item.
