--NEWS FLASH: AP Wire Service--

MID OHIO RACEWAY:  In what some experts are describing an apparent
"cyberspace-induced traumatic disorder,"of immense proportions--and one of
the first manifestations seen anywhere--group of crazed, car-loving
individuals, also known as the "Porsche Fans" descended en masse on the
famous Mid-Ohio Raceway, disrupting, some sources say, a "very
well-publicized" track driving event.  The mob was incoherent, muttering
only some unintelligible gibberish that sounded something remotely like:
"Ted! Ted! Ted!"  Informed sources say that, in fact, the person known as
"Ted" was not directly responsible for this mass disruption, and that-and
this is speculation-this apparent phenomenon was attributed to a mysterious
"Ted" from a long ago, now defunct but similar group known as the
"Porschephiles."  Expert are baffled, but are only too quick to point out
that, in our increasing reliance on cyperspace as a means of entertainment,
we can go over the edge with ever-increasing unpredictability.
Fortunately, in this instance there were no casualties, and the mob became
calm again once the sound of engines was heard.
