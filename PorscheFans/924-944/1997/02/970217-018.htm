I dont know about the coupes, but my convertable 968 stickered at
about$57,000 when I got it in 93. I did not have the M030 (I dont think it
was available on the convertables, I did want it), but I did get the limited
slip, full power drivers seat, 17" wheels, hmm, I dont know if there were any
other options...I would have to go look for my window sticker. I didnt take
the expensive radio as I put one in later (along with suspension, roll bar,
etc) but I do know the sticker was 57 and change... - Doug
