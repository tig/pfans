You can install audio gear in the two storage wells, or even the spare
tire well, if the component is small.  Keep them mounted a few inches from
the bottom, because it is common for water to collect there during rainy
periods.  At least it is for my car, and a few others on this list..  ;-)
Use lots of double stick foam mounting tape instead of screws - I prefer 
not to drill into the body to maintain the anti-corrosion properties.

My amplifier was too big to fit into the well, so I was forced to mount 
it on the floor of the trunk.  The space under the seats is so small, 
maybe a sheet of paper will fit underneath, so that location is out.  
Others have mounted components way up in the footwell, but that seems tough.

When I did my install, I removed the passenger seat so I could run the 
cables under the carpet.  Makes for an easier job, and the seat is simple 
to remove.  Congratulations on your purchase!  Be sure to read the 944 
FAQ to get yourself informed on the 944's ideosyncrasies.

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.
