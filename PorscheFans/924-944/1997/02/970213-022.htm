Hey, go for it. There is no problem that cannot be solved by spending
enough time and money.  :-)

Honestly, my advice to anyone who is contemplating a swap like this is
to not do it... If you want a 944 Turbo Cab, fly to Germany, buy one, 
import it and be done with it (probably only spending an extra ten or 
twelve grand to make it happen...)

But, then, hey, nobody takes my advice anyway...


Good Luck!
