Hello All,

  I am thinking about getting into this world at the entry level, namely 
a 83-85 944.  How much of a committment is it?  I would prefer to not 
have to make repairs more than once or twice a year?  Should I expect 
worse than that from a 944?  This is supposing an "averagely" maintained 
car, with just under 100,000 miles on it (my target reading).  The place 
I am going through to get it offers a one-year warrantee, so, hopefully, 
repair costs won't be a problem for one year, just inconvenience.  Also, 


how hard are they to drive for a first-time manual transmission driver 
(my fiancee), someone who is used to cadillacs and buicks?  I learned on an 
'81 924, and it wasn't the easiest thing to drive for the inexperienced 
(I seemed to have to push the clutch forever, then when I got used to 
where the friction point was, the owner raised it).  Honda Preludes are much 
more forgiving.  I read the FAQ about things to look for, which is quite 
a list (I am going to bring it with me when I look, likely to the chagrin 
of the dealer).  Is there some sort of "consumer reports" type rating of 
expects repair costs and such?  I guess what I am looking for is a MTBF 
(mean time between failure) measurement.  It's either a 944 or an MR2, so 
please, what choice should I make?  

Thank you for you time,


Derek Fisher

PS...what kind of MPG do they get?
