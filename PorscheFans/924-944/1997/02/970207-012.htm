Well, heres the skinny. Found an outfit in Austin that specializes in Mercedes and
Porsche machine work. Apparently, the Chevy Vega was the first car to come out
with these style engine blocks, and Merc & Porsche latched onto it. The Vega was
history, as we all know.

Anyhow, machine shop was quite knowledgable, did all the measurements, and has
suggested that reringing will get another 40-50K, without big bucks. There is slight
taper on the bore. Indeed, oversize pistons are available.

My crank is fine, and is undergoing micropolishing today.

In general, have spent 4 weekends on this project. All parts, bolts, washers etc are
very shiny, all in their little plastic named baggies. Have ordered rebuilt turbo, all new 
hoses, ignition, belts, pumps. About to order all the bearings, rings, misc studs, nuts,
oil cooler hoses, belt idlers and tensioners, o rings that were missing from gaskets kits.
clutch, pilot bearings, etc etc.

This car has new radiator, alternator, air compressor, PS pump etc. Will be working on
the suspension after this, and possible a paint job if the engine goes togther and runs well

"Phil asked whether to bore or not to bore"

First, measure the cylinder diameter with a micrometer, should be 3.94" or
100mm.  Wear limit is 0.080.

If you pull the pistons, check the ring end gap, #1 and #2 rings should be 0.20
to 0.40 with a limit of 0.080.
Piston/cylinder clearance 0.008 to 0.032 with a wear limit of 0.080.

If the cylinders, pistons and rings are OK, don't mess with them.  If you do
have to re-ring have a shop that knows 944s do the light hone.  They have to use
a special stone.  

As for boring, check with your dealer about oversize pistons.  The last I heard
was that the factory was not selling the dealers any oversized pistons anymore
as they have had problems with boring the cylinders oversize.  My engine builder
suspects there is not enough cylinder wall to safely take them more than one
size over.  He designed ductile iron liners, milled out the cylinders and fusion
bonder in the liners.   

If you need new/different pistons and are on a budget, give George B. a call.
He may have some slightly used ones that will work.  Also EBS was advertising
std size for about $500 a set a while back.

Reading between the lines, I suspect you are telling yourself, "It took forever
to pull and as long as I have it out. . . . . .".  Warning!  This type of
thinking can cause serious damage to your wallet.  On the other hand, we only go
around one time.  Keep it running in top shape and you will have a better car
than the majority on the road.
