	Well, I think they're worth buying :) That's a decent price for
	an 87 924S in good condition. I think it's a good car but it
	has its quirks. Does the owner have records? Where was the car
	maintained? Do you have a shop to take it to yet? What did
	they say when they looked at it? Don't buy this car without
	having a good pro you trust check it out for you.

	Porsches are more expensive to maintain the VW's. They are
	not the same thing.VW's are econoboxes and can be thrown away
	when they go realy bad. Porsches are racing cars and get very
	expensive very quickly when they break. They require top notch
	maintenance especially the water cooled ones. Don't think of this
	car like it's a VW; think of it as an F1 car (ok, I'm
	exaggerating) with the appropriate maintenance costs and 
	idiosyncracies. Good luck!
