I have a 1990 S2 with a annoying problem that I hope someone might be able
to help me with. When the temperature gauge reaches operating temp (which is
always a little below the 1st indicator mark, which should correspond to
approximately 80 degrees C) the car starts the annoying practice of cycling
both fans between max. and min. rpm. When I'm stopped at a traffic light the
car sounds like a Hoover vacuum cleaner on acid! According to everything
I've read, the secondary cooling fan is not supposed to come on until the
temperature gets quite high, or the A/C is activated. My car always runs
cool and the dumb thing is even doing this in the winter (well, as much
winter as we get in the San Francisco Bay area). Also when I turn the car
off the fans will cycle between high and low for several minutes and will
continue to do so as much as a few hours later if I turn the key back on.
Now with that said, this is what I've done so far. 1. replaced the radiator
tempswitch with both a earlier opening unit (made the problem worse) and a
new stock unit (activated @92 and 102 degrees C) results were: no change. 2.
replaced the intake manifold tempswitch (unique to S2's and maybe 951's)
this did nothing to change the symptoms. 3.I finally switched out the G1 or
G10 relay in the fuse/relay box (not sure of the relay # designation at the
moment but its the big double relay in the rear of the fuse/relay box. I did
this just long enough to see if the symptom went away (this puppy cost
100.00 and you know electrical parts are generally non-refundable) anyway
this too resulted in no change. So there we have it, any help would be
greatly appreciated. I haven't found anyone at Porsche who seems to know the
proper operation of these fans (as relates to an S2, seems these cars are
evidently rare and unique enough to be an enigma to most). I'm reluctant to
take the car to Porsche and let someone who is not sure how it should work
in the first place, go on a fishing expedition at 75.00/hr. Any one got an
idea?
