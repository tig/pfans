Why weren't you willing to modify the cabling?  The Optima has a 72 month
guarantee.  Do you intend to keep your car longer than that?  Judging by
the previous vehicle you owned I'm sure you will make many modifications
to your 951 that will be much more significant than a simple battery
modification.

You could have done this job yourself by picking up some of those trick
gold-plated battery terminals used for audio systems.  I just put an
Optima 800 in my old mega hot-rodded Ford Capri.  Works great, looks
great.  I paid $120 for mine.  Another choice would have been a Stinger
battery at $160 or so.  Both are totally sealed and can be installed in
any position.

This is interesting because I looked at Sears before getting my Optima =
and
the only European style mount "international" battery they had in stock
looked just like the previous two I had used for so many years.  If your
new battery has two removable plastic "lids" over the cells, then it is
NOT sealed and it will leak (some).  Mine always did.  Sears still uses
the standard lead/acid construction if I'm not mistaken.  BTW, what's the
stock number?  I'd like this for future reference since this style =
battery
is also used in my Audi.

Anyway, hope your problem is solved :-)
