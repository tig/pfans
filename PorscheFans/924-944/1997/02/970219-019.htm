Clark,

I have been using SO-2s (225/245) since May and have yet to try anything
that can compare to these in the rain. I feel so much more confident
with these in the rain. I've used, D40M2s, PZeros, RE-71s, BFG TA VR4.
The SO-2s worked well on the track and wear better that any others I
have used.

Greetings all!

Well, after no help from the US support for NTMail, I went to the U.K.
Support.  Much better!  It took some work to analyse (have to spell it their
way) the problem, but they had me make some changes, and so far soo good. 
Yesterday's digests were the first to be affected by the changes, and there
are no repeats that I can see.  I'll be keeping an eye on things.

read/sorted/filed/deleted?

I've heard of a few mail clients that do this, but I don't know of one right
off.  One tool I've found that does work (suprisingly enough) is WinZIP.
Yeah, WinZIP.  I'm using v6.2  I didn't believe it either, but it works!
