But mine is doing just the opposite. Turn the heat off and things cool =
right down.
If the thermostat was not opening, then the coolant in the radiator =
would stay cool, but=20
Mine seems to be warm enough to activate the fans.

 I've bled it a couple of times. It hasn't lost a drop of coolant. I =
marked a line on the reservoir, and I check it often. It all seems =
strange, because if it is plugged heater core one would assume that I =
wouldn't get any heat through the heater. But I get plenty of that, and =
it seems to deliver the desired temperature no matter what it is set on. =
Though I haven't had time to really examine the way the plumbing is =
routed, I assume that you could remove or plug the line to the heater =
core and it would no effect on the engine cooling. But then again this =
is a Porsche 8-).
