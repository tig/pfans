This exact same thing has been happening to my '87 944T for the last four months (ever 
since I bought it!)  I've replaced the "DME thingy" and the starter relay to no avail...
It seems to be temperature related too. (I mean directly temperature related. -- Popping 
my hood reduced the 10 minute wait to a 3 minute wait!!!)

It used to happen once a month or so, and it progressed to a daily occurence (which 
makes it a lot easier tell if you've fixed it.)  

So on a hunch we threw in a new coil, and this seems to have fixed it.  Its only been 
about a month though. If the coil is heat sensitive its darned tough to test since you 
kind of need the hood up to test it, and having the hood up tends to prevent the 
problem. I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too :-)
But before you do anything expensive, you might want to try it...
Good luck (to both of us)

-Dave
