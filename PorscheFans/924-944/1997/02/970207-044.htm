Hello Karl,

I had a similar choice recently.  I got rid of my p6's for a spankin'
new set of SP Sport 8000's on a set of used, but perfect Porsche 7
spokes (Design 90's ?)
Anyway, I was told that the D40M2's were good, but was an older design
than the 8000's and everything about the 8000s was better (from traction
to wear...)  
Also, the Sport 8000 don't come in 215/15's.
Tire rack also steered (pun intended) me away from Pzeros (wear out very
fast), MXX3's (hate the wet), and the new Yoko's (both).  They also told
me that Pirelli's aren't manufactured as well as the Dunlop's or
Michelin's, etc...
I have a friend with an Ur-Quattro, and another with a Maserati 228, and
they both use Sp Sport 8000's.  We love 'em.

I don't know much about the Toyo Proxes but my friend with a Eclipse
(gasp!) wore his out really fast (the fronts of course) and hated them
in the rain.

Get the 8000's ,a good set of new rims, and drive really fast...

Hope it helps
