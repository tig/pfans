Hello everyone,

I went and replaced my fuel injectors over the weekend. Here's a list of
what I broke in the process:

    1). All four injector wiring harness connectors (thought I had it down
        by the last one).

    2). Both spark plug wire retaining clips (plastic gets really brittle
        if you cook it for 13 years).

    3). I think I may have started to strip the frontmost fuel rail mount-
        ing hole. It's holding though.

Not bad, huh? I didn't mention all the blood spilled, but I guess that goes
without saying.

That said, it went pretty well overall. The car is definitely running 
better
now. I can't feel as much hesitation when accelerating. Still a little bit
though, I think. The plastic cap on number two injector was cracked badly,
and the o-ring was shredded. The others looked O.K. My idle, however, still
moves around a little bit. I was hoping to cure this.

I also replaced the pressure regulator & damper. These were a bitch and a
half to get off the rail! Everything I tried was bending the skinny little
sheet metal mounting brackets. I ended up clamping down on the actual parts
with vise-grips, using a boxed wrench on the mounting bolt/nut and using
the old "squeeze the two wrenches together" trick. This and liquid wrench
got them broken loose finally. Ended up crushing the living crap out of the
parts though. 

Now I have two more shiny parts under the hood making the rest of the
engine look bad.
