  On my 85.5 944, normally aspirated, the washer behind the wheel bearing 
retaining collar has a small protrusion which slides into a groove on the 
shaft, preventing adjustment as the Haynes manual describes.  ie. I can't spin 
the washer at all no matter how loose the retaining collar is. For now I have 
tightened the retaining collar until there was no play, and the wheel still 
spins freely.  Anyone have any advice?  Grind the protrusion on the washer so 
it spins? I am replacing the bearings (preventative reasons), and would like 
to get it right.
TIA,
    Ezra (ehall@btv.ibm.com)
