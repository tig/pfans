Tom, I bought my 88 951S in Houston almost two years ago for $13,750. It
had 70,000 miles and looked mint. Since that time I've put 24,000 miles
on the car along with the following repairs:
- new belts, rollers and seals were replaced when I brought the car
home.
- new front rotors and pads
- throttle switch
- turbo timer valve
- clutch
- window regulator

I do all of my own work (except for the timing belt) so the total cost
of repairs and maintenance has been $2,000.
