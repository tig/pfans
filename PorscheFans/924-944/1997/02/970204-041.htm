There's no reason to act like an immature child about this.  Ross was
simply trying to help out.  He took the appropriate action, rather than
spamming the whole list like you did.  Obviously, the rest of us were 
already aware of the multiple messages and didn't need to be told about
them.  Btw, it is his business since it was posted to the entire group.
