PFans,

Just got a new insurance policy in the mail on the '89 951 we have =
insured
through State Farm and while looking over the papers I saw a new
"endorsement" regarding "Race or Speed Contest Exclusion."  Very simply =
it
states:

"In consideration of the premium charged for your policy, it is agreed
there is no coverage as to any motor vehicle while used in a prearranged
race or speed contest."

Seeing as this statement is rather vague as to what they mean I called my
agent, who in turn called the underwriter.  What she told me is this:  we
can NOT use this vehicle on any "race track" for any purpose whatsoever,
even if it is driven at only 10 mph.  Furthermore she told me that if it
was driven on a "race track" my policy would be canceled.   Hmmm, it
doesn' say THAT in the statement above!  My specific question was about
driving the vehicle in a PCA Driver's Ed course and was told NO.

I do not equate driving in a Driver's Ed school with taking part in a
"prearranged race or speed contest."  Apparently State Farm does.  I =
would
assume this also includes events such as parking lot autocross, etc.

Anyone have any insight into the above, or care to share what insurance
company they use that DOES cover their car for Driver's Ed events.

TIA,
