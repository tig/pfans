Looks like you can't tell a Hyundai from a "Huyndai," whatever that is.

> Point being that this person, whatever color, race or creed, is lieing about
                                                                  ^^^^^^
No, the point is daddy left you with the keys to a Porsche and you think you are 
suddenly very cool. Work on your spellings first, stop lying (write that on the 
board now, lying, not "lieing"), and stop making stupid generalizations about 
people and cars you know nothing about ("duuuuh didn't know if she was Chinese 
or Vietnamese". . ."duuuuh and then I go ahead misspell a Korean car's name...")

Less morons like you with your useless drool on this list, and a lot of wasted 
bandwidth would be conserved. Go play somewhere else little boy, this here's the 
men's room!
