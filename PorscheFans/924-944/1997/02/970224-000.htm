Hello p-fans
	Im the proud new owner of an 85.5 944.  I've always wanted a 944 and with
the help of this list I was able to bring alot of knowledge to my search.
The car has 71k miles, and a great original history.  The problem comes
from the 2nd owner (as i am the 3rd) who happened to be a 16 yr old female
who drove it to high school for 4 months(i wish i had this car in high
school!).  
	She was forced to sell the car after speeding tickets (and parents) forced
her to sell.  Fortunatley, she didn't have the car long enough to do fatal
damage, but she did insist on installing a sanyo cd player and a jenson amp
which was attached underneath the drivers side dash to the steering column
by plastic zip ties.  The power to this "system" came from tapping into the
wiring harness drivers side, from the fuse station.  She also put "NO FEAR"
stickers in the window. (poor car)
	Before I purchased the car (it ran great), a problem occurred when the cd
player was turned on an smoke arrose from underneath the dash. The girl
jumped out of the car screaming (i am told), while wires from the harnes
shorted and the insulation was completely burned off of 4 wires.  It turns
out that these wires are ultimately connected to the factory alarm.  Power
has been completely shut off to anything in the car.  
	Knowing that many things could have happened to cause this situation, my
early assumptions are that the amp was hot enough to melt through the
insulation of the wires causing the short.  Or, that the amp had very
little to do with the short, but i dont believe that.
	my questions are:
	
1). What, within the line of power, could have been affected (and blown
up)? capacitors, chips, etc.?

2). Could my factory alarm have self destructed?  Is this common to
porsche? anyone else had a simillar electrical prob. ?
	I understand that if the alarm is not in order, there wont be any power to
the ignition.  But if the amp was not the culprit then im just mending the
wires without correcting the real problem.

Its a beautiful car, mechanicly sound, and i paid less for it than a
"parts" car - so i dont have a problem dropping some extra dollars to
return it to its glory.

thanks for any information in advance !
