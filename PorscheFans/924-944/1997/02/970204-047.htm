Hi Jon,

That valve that has two large air hoses and a small vacuum hose is what is
sometimes referred to as a pop off valve.  When manifold vacuum is present,
the valve opens allowing the turbo output to connect to the turbo input. 
This allows the turbo to maintain speed during shifting which results in
faster response after the shift (less turbo lag).  They fail from time to
time, which hurts the performance of the car right after a shift while
accelerating.  You can test the valve by removing it and sucking on the
vacuum fitting.  You should see the internals move open.  If not, it has
failed.  Having a bad valve increases turbo lag, but shouldn't cause any
other problems.  I found that mine failed about every 30,000 miles.  I'd
notice that the car didn't seem as fast.

Regards, Gary
