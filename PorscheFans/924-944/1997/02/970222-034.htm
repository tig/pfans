My phone rings and my engine builder, hence forth known as "the master", asks me
when I am going to pull apart his small block engine as promised.  Months ago I
had made a causal remark that it would be interesting to tear down an engine.
He explained that the lower half of the w/c Porsche and small block Chevy were
very similar and that I could learn a great deal by pulling apart a Chevy.  I
must of said good idea because the master does not forget the smallest detail.
Knowing that the master does not feel the impact wrench is God's gift to engine
building, I try and weasel out.  I ask if I can tear it down using his 1/2"
impact, he replies that I can, I'm stuck.

Saturday finds me entering the master's shop, tool box in hand.  The master
emerges from his lair of engine parts and machines, fixes me with a stare and
mutters the words that will soon become very familiar:  "See one, do one, teach
one".  I have entered the twilight zone of engine dismantling and Eastern
philosophy.

I had expected to dazzle him with a shower of nuts, bolts and various parts
flying from the 350 4 bolt main. Not so, I am in the seeing phase, we
methodically begin disassembly and inspection.  Sherlock Homes would of been
proud of the master's detective work.  Not only did I learn numerous tricks of
the trade, but also how to read bearings, piston skirts, cams, rocker arms,
valves, cylinder walls, etc..  I suck it all in like a sponge.  I will be the
hit of the next party when I give a detailed description of piston skirt wear
and cylinder trueness.  If that does not wow them, I can recant the master's 15
minute dissertation on crankshaft primary and secondary balance harmonics and
the tell tail signs it leaves on the main bearings.

The day comes to an end with not one thing left on the block.  I may have passed
Engine & Zen 101 after all.  The history of the small block Chevy since the
1950s is no longer a mystery to me.  

The master calls me in to his milling machine.  As I approach, I see my Porsche
flywheel and clutch assembly mounted on his mill.  He explains in detail how he
spent hours mounting the assembly so it was perfectly lined up so he could
machine and install the crank triggers and bell housing sensor.  The various
parts of the new MSD ignition system are explained with volts, joules and
electrons flying over my head for the most part.  The conclusion being that when
one modifies, all systems are affected and may have to be upgraded.  Just adding
a giant aftermarker coil is a waste of money.  If the system requires upgrading
an entire integrated package is called for.  I do not ask how much, I just nod.
The basic Motronic system is good as long as the engine changes are not drastic.
If you upgrade your ignition or if your spark plug wires need replacing, he
recommends Nology wires.  I learn about how  the built in capacitors work.

We move over to his crank balancing machine.  I am treated to a comparative
narration on the merits of the different brands of balancers.  He balances the
crank, then balances it with the flywheel and clutch assembly and finally with
the front pulley installed.  No evil harmonics in my engine.

At his flow bench, the theory of air/fuel flow dynamics, combustion chamber
shape, spark plug location and piston quench area are are compared and
contrasted on my Porsche, small block Chevy and large block Chevy heads.  As my
eyes start to glaze over, I notice that the intake valves on the magnesium big
block head are the size of my fist, no comparison there.

Steeped in internal combustion theory, I start to edge towards the exit.  The
master steers me towards another engine on a stand.  Small block Chevy, hmmmm.
As he goes through the "see one, do one, teach one", he points out this is my
"do one".  Ahhhhh, I just did one.  "No" he says, "you just saw one done".
There is a lesson here somewhere that I have yet to grasp. The master mentions
how he had stopped keeping track of the hours on my engine when he spent the
better part of a week boring my block for the liners.  A light goes on, suddenly
I have no argument with "do one".  Trading labor and receiving a technical
education at the same time, life if good.

"Do one" several weeks later turns out to be, "see one, forget one, ask
questions".  The master is not pleased when he catches me removing the
connecting rod nuts with the impact wrench.  My temporary lapse of memory is
rewarded with a refresher course on metallurgy and stresses.

The engine grudgingly sheds its parts.  The master stands back and nods
approvingly.  Now is the time to impress him.  I pull out my freeze plug removal
invention, the master grunts.  I will not get rich selling freeze plug removers,
it is a dismal failure.  The master consoles me by explaining in detail about
freeze plug design and why my invention, even a beta version, would never work.
As the engine comes apart, the master relays its life history and points out the
results of the incompetence of the previous builder.  As he ferrets out each
clue, I make a mental note to get my detective skills up to speed by watching
some old Pink Panther movies.   

The pistons are finally back from the coater.  We have all the parts, this thing
should fly together.  Well, fly may have been the wrong term.  The master
informs me the final hone to fit the pistons and rings cannot be rushed.  I
start eye balling my old Volvo P1800s and wonder if I could get it running
before the Porsche.
