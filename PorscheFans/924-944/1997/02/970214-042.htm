	Marc,



	You're going about this the wrong way. You need to find the
	real reason your car is overheating rather than switching
	out parts you may think are causing the problem. I think your
	gauge is probably ok and that your car really is overheating.
	You should be able to smell the hot coolant. Also, if your shop
	is a good one, they'll have an infrared gun. Aim at the radiator
	and associated hoses and that'll tell you how hot your car is.
	I notice you had a lot of work done to the cooling system; did
	they bleed the system at all/correctly? Btw, don't let this car
	overheat!! I can't stress this enough. If it gets hot again, shut
	it off and call a wrecker. That's $50 vs. $$$$!

Good luck,
