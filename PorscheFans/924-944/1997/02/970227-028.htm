Another one for your files:

I recently picked up a vibration in both pedals in my '87 951 which has the 
four spring "sport/cup car" disc.  I thought that the clutch was going (TO 
bearing?) after only a year of use (of course with 20-30 AX's and six big track 
events times two drivers...)

It was suspicious in that the feeling was coming through both pedals, and was 
more noticeable when the car was cold.  A typical clutch problem shouldn't 
manifest through the gas pedal...The problem could be felt at idle or under 
power.  An number of outside "professional" experts felt the vibration and 
agreed that it was a clutch problem...

Anyway, by a stroke of genius and good fortune during a big track tech 
inspection, we found one of the two A/C compressor mounting bolts was broken.  
This allowed the compressor to rattle against the engine block, thus creating 
the vibration.  We found it by listening with an automotive stethescope (a 
great tool which everyone should have).  With the 'scope, it sounded like the 
rattle/vibration was coming from the turbo, which didn't make any sense so we 
further traced it to the compressor.

When I fished the compressor out last night, the second bolt broke in half in 
my hand (after I got it out).  The strain and vibration caused by the first 
bolt's failure literally "sawed" through the second, final bolt.  Good thing I 
didn't get on the big track with this problem-- could have been a catastrophe 
for me and the guy behind me if the compressor went flying.

Anyway, I had to drill through the bolt-end (what a colossal pain, as I didn't 
want to disconnect the A/C line from the compressor) and now have a through-
bolt and nut in the offending location.  Apparently, this kind of thing happens 
to 944s and 951s, although it is the first I've heard about it , and I have had 
at least one of these cars for the last 11 years.

So, here is another thing for you to check during your maintenance regimen.  
Especially if you pick up a vibration that seems like a clutch or motor mount 
or balance shaft or turbo problem.

By the way, if you ever dismantle your airbox, be sure to use loctite on the 
screws which attach it to the air flow meter from the inside.  If these rascals 
backout, they can get sucked into the turbine blades.  This happened to a 
friend's car a few years back, and the turbo charge was deystroyed.

For those who are wondering: why would you leave in the A/C in a car that is so 
modified for AX and track use?  Doesn't it add extra weight?

The answer is, it gets hot out here in CA at some of our events-- over 110 
degrees F.  Until I start to pull the thing on a trailer (maybe in a couple of 
years) I'd rather be comfortable and deal with the extra weight.  Its way 
faster than I can drive it anyway, especially with the Milledge race chips.
