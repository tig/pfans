Here are a couple more '87 944 questions...  This is a car I just bought,
and am just getting "into" it.

1) I am concerned about my car having been run without power steering fluid
for a (possibly) long period of time.  When I bought it the reservoir was
dry!  I added fluid and bled the system, and it works!  I am wondering if
the pump is working at full capacity, though.  How much assist should my
car have?  The pump doesn't make any weird or unusual noises, and when I
turn the wheel to the end of it's travel, I can hear the fluid flowing
through the system.  I haven't detected any signs of leaking fluid,
either?!?

2) My car has power door locks, but they don't work.  I was wondering what
their mode of operation is.  I see both doors have a lock motor, but there
isn't a switch to operate them.  Are they operated by the (manual) door
locks?  The car did have an alarm system, and I beleive the wiring for the
locks has been modified for a remote system.  Where do the power lock wires
run?

3) Who sells an air filter for this car?  The Fram book doesn't list a
number for it.  I didn't think the 944 was that exotic ; )

4) Who sells original style keys?  I have the key with what used to be a
push-button light.  The PO seems to have lost the light bulb and the button
(not to mention whatever metal parts were in there.)  

5) What is the part number for the latest engine mounts?

6) Does the 944 use an antenna amplifier?  If so, what are the details
(where is it, what wires "run" it, etc...)

I guess that'll do it for now.  I have to hunt down a service manual
(Chilton / Haynes / ?????)  Thanks for any info you can provide.  I am
going to try to get started working on the car next week.
