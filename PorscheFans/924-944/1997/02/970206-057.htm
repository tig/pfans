"Phil asked whether to bore or not to bore"

First, measure the cylinder diameter with a micrometer, should be 3.94" or
100mm.  Wear limit is 0.080.

If you pull the pistons, check the ring end gap, #1 and #2 rings should be 0.20
to 0.40 with a limit of 0.080.
Piston/cylinder clearance 0.008 to 0.032 with a wear limit of 0.080.

If the cylinders, pistons and rings are OK, don't mess with them.  If you do
have to re-ring have a shop that knows 944s do the light hone.  They have to use
a special stone.  

As for boring, check with your dealer about oversize pistons.  The last I heard
was that the factory was not selling the dealers any oversized pistons anymore
as they have had problems with boring the cylinders oversize.  My engine builder
suspects there is not enough cylinder wall to safely take them more than one
size over.  He designed ductile iron liners, milled out the cylinders and fusion
bonder in the liners.   

If you need new/different pistons and are on a budget, give George B. a call.
He may have some slightly used ones that will work.  Also EBS was advertising
std size for about $500 a set a while back.

Reading between the lines, I suspect you are telling yourself, "It took forever
to pull and as long as I have it out. . . . . .".  Warning!  This type of
thinking can cause serious damage to your wallet.  On the other hand, we only go
around one time.  Keep it running in top shape and you will have a better car
than the majority on the road.
