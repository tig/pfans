Lately, on my '79 924, I noticed a sort of grinding sound when the car's
idling.  It only seems to show up after the car's been running for a while
(like twenty minutes or half an hour), and never when the engine is cold.
I initially thought that I was really, really low on oil and the engine
was about to explode, since I have a small oil leak from the oil pan, but
the oil level has remained consistently at the second water mark.

It's hard to describe the sound.  A friend claims it's coming from the
rear of the car, but I really doubt it, since the only thing back there is
the transmission and the sound occurs no matter what gear I'm in or how I
shift.  It sounds fairly high-pitched and is definitely either a grinding
or bad vibration -- I can feel it on the pedals.  Revving the engine does
nothing.  However, the sound either goes away or is muted by the engine
when I get moving (say, 20+ mph).  I don't feel it on the pedals, but I do
sometimes hear it as soon as I put in the clutch as the engine speed is
dropping to idle, leading me to believe that it's still happening, even at
3K+ rpm.  (Took the car up to 4K in neutral once to see if the sound would
go away.  It didn't.)

Also, the grinding is sort of periodic.  It'll come on for two or three
seconds, stop for a second or two, and then come back.  Sometimes, it'll
stop for as long as a minute (but I've never idled the car longer than
that, so I really can't say if it would last longer).

One last piece of information: once, by chance, I was looking at the
volt-meter when the grinding sound stopped.  It had been staying at around
13V or so, but jumped up to almost 14V, where it usually is.  This is the
only time I'd observed that, and I really can't remember if I had the turn
indicator or anything on at the time.

My first question is whether or not this is something I should feel
worried about.  Everyone I've spoken to is made a little nervous by the
sound, but they don't think it's really dangerous.  Taking a look at the
engine when it was doing this, I didn't notice any belts flying apart or
bolts shattering.  In fact, the engine seemed pretty normal, except for
that damn sound.  (Which, by the way, is about the pitch of the 924
windshield wiper fluid pumps when there's no fluid in the reservoir, but
more vibration-ey.)

Second is, of course, what the problem is.  Doesn't seem to affect
performance at all; the car's been running pretty smoothly of late.  (I
can only get an honest 110mph, really, but I hope that will improve when I
strip out the emissions control systems.  (Just kidding.)  (Well, maybe
just the catalytic converter.))

Thanks...  I'm willing to take even "well, this is for the 944, but might
apply to the 924 anyway" advice!
