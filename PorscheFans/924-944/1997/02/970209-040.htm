Thanks to all for your input on tire choices. I am leaning in the
direction
of the YOKO A008RS.

I just purchased a used set of yellow Koni sport shocks (front struts
and
rear shocks, M474 option). It says adjustable on the body, but I don't
know
how to adjust them. The struts do not have the dial selector on top. Can
anyone enlighten me?

I also got springs with the shocks. They have two yellow dots on them. I
think they are slighly stiffer than than the stock springs in my 86
turbo,
about 175#. Should I use them or go to a stiffer 220# spring?

Lastly, if I install the sport shocks and struts, and the two dot coils,
without changing the stabilizer bars or the rear torsion bars, will I
end up
with an evil handling car?

Thanks,

Paul,

Assuming these are the same as the Koni yellows, the front shocks should
be adjustable by a small tab on the top. They can be adjusted in the
car. The rears are adjusted by compressing fully until they engage, then
turning.

Both front and rear have about 2.5 turns adjustability, make sure you
don't turn them further than they want to go.

I'm not sure which direction you have to turn, but I think it's
anti-clockwise for the front and clockwise for the back to make them
stiffer.

About the springs. I have 260 lb in the front with 26mm torsion bars in
back. They seem to balance OK with the stock sway bars, but I some
oversteer. I would suggest heavier springs.
