Dear Wes:

<< What's "Euroselect"? Is it OEM or aftermarket parts? TIA
  >>

Porsche  North America tried to lower the prices on water cooled parts by
having them manufactured in the US and other countries.  They used the same
part numbers as the German made parts, and were supposedly the same quality
as the OEM parts.  The program went down the drain for several reasons,
including that some of the Euroselect parts were not up to the same quality
as the original Porsche parts.  There are several discount parts places that
sell  many of these parts as the original when in fact they are not.  There
may be a world of difference between a "Porsche" part and an "O.E.M." part.
 The Porsche part must meet specific standards as to materials, quality,
workmanship, etc.  An OEM part made by the same company may not meet the same
standards as to these criteria.  Thus if you buy an OEM part at a significant
discount, you may be getting exactly what you are paying for. 

I hope this helps.

Thank you,
