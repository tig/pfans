  Well I purchased another 944 this weekend. An 85  black on black
with 110K.  The paint is in great shape it's a very clean car.
 I needed another driver so I would'nt have to drive my cabrio in
the rain.
  I bought the car for $1900 , knowing that there was a motor
problem, and that I might have to replace the motor. Not really
a big deal since I have a couple of extra motors right now.
 The guy told me that the car makes a noise, and it gets louder
 as the RPM's go up.
    So I bought it and hauld it home .  Well my brother came over, and
we decided to find out exactly what the problem was. We could see oil
everywhere. So I charged up the battery and started her up . While my
brother had his head under the hood. Immediatly he started yelling
SHUT IT DOWN , SHUT IT DOWN !!! as if he really needed to tell me that.
  I dont think I could even describe the sound it made, but all of my neighbors
proabably could.
   The noise that seems to get louder as you rev it up. It's the ballance shaft
that came loose and broke through it's housing and just sort of flops
around under the intake
 manifold .
  He actualy drove the thing to a shop to see what was the matter.

   Has anyone else had a similar problem with a balance shaft?

 What would cause it to break the bolts that hold it in place?
