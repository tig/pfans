I figured I'd offer my $0.02 worth as the owner of a '93 RX-7 R1 and
somebody that made the choice between a 3rd gen 7 and a 951S less than
10 months ago. First off, I'd like to stick with a comparison of stock
cars. An extra 100 hp only costs about $5,000 for an RX-7 and there's
room for more. There's a couple people on the RX-7 list that ran a
self-modified 500hp 3rd gen 7 in the One Lap of America last year and
came in 14th overall (despite very limited racing experience and no
test time at the tracks) ahead of several high-budget  and factory
teams (including several 911's).

My main criteria and which car prevailed in each category:

1. Finding a good clean example.
Had a hard time even finding a TS, but came across 3 '93 R1's locally
in under 2 months. Passed on 2, bought 3rd.

2. Price
The 944 TS had a slight edge here, but not a lot, considering people
seem to want considerably more than the book value.

3. Cost of maintenance/ownership
Since I don't do any of the work myself, this was important. The latest
951 is 4 years older than the oldest 3rd gen 7. I'll admit the Porsche
is (much) better put together. Cost of a comprehensive service
contract: $1500 for 12mo/12K mi for the 944 TS, $700 for 36mo/36K mi
for the Mazda.

4. Performance
The 7 is quicker in a straight line and feels faster in general. Turbo
lag is reduced due to the sequential twin turbo system. Especially,
with the R1/R2 package, handling is incredible.

5. Feel
The Porsche feels more solid but the 7 steers and handles like a go-cart.

6. Looks and exclusivity
This is obviously more subjective than the other categories. For me,
the 7 won in both departments, hands down. I see maybe a half dozen 944
(not necessarily 951's, but how many people know the difference?) every
day, and maybe that number of RX-7's in a month. Around here, it seems
like I wouldn't get any more attention (in my red R1 with 17" Anteras
101's) than I would get in a 512.  Almost amusing to see people trying
to figure out what the hell that "real purty car" is. Actually, this
one couple walking around the pits at a PCA track event I was at,
decided mine was the best looking car there. (I didn't necessarily
agree since I was sharing an instructor with somebody driving a '91 348
and there was a few real nice 911's. :)

7. Marque
Well, a Porsche is a Porsche. On the other hand, the name Mazda doesn't
really come with much history or heritage (though the RX-7 is fairly
well known in performance circles and has been raced). Believe it or
not, I'm a die-hard Porsche fan -- just have never owned one since they
always seem to lose in the performance/$$$ category. (I'm only on my
3rd car -- I'd never owned anything with 4 wheels till about 2.5 years
ago, and I'm trying to make up for lost time now.) While Porsche's
racing successes are something to be envied (I was on my feet
applauding when Porsche took 1-2-3 at Le Mans last year), the name
Porsche for most people is really synonymous with the 911, not the
944.  Sorry, but that's the truth. So, while a 944/951 is a Porsche, it
really ain't a "real" one. Also, a lot of people are put off by the
fact that it's "just a 4-banger." (Nope, I'm not trying to start a
flame fest here; just making some observations.) But then, there's
Mazda -- how do you respect a company whose sole "sports car" (and I
assume they use the term real loosely) now is the Miata!

8. Long term use
The Porsche is so much better put together, there's really no contest.
However, this wasn't an issue for me since nothing lasts even an year
with me. (Anybody care to buy me a 993 to put that theory to test? :)


Well, there it is. I picked the 7. However, 9 months later, it's up for
sale.  Guess what I'm looking for... yup, a 944. Only, this time
around, it's not the nicest, fastest street car I want, but an NA 944
that I can set up for track use and eventually race. I figure a 951
would put me in a class I'd not be comfortable racing in (initially).
Also, my insurance premium is ridiculously high for anything with a
turbo (or two!).

Btw, (if anybody's still reading), there's a black '89 951 with 48K mi
for sale in Raleigh, NC, at a local Porsche dealer (so I assume it's
going to include Porsche's 1yr/unlimited mile warranty.). They're
asking for $18,000 but I bet they'd take less. Email me for details if
you're interested. I'd be happy to test drive it for you... :)

Verbosely,
Amit
