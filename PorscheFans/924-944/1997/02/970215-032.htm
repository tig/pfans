I believe the preferred terminology for most people is "get a 951 or
you're getting crap."  Actually, I'm running into this (significant)
bottleneck on my 924, but there are even fewer performance upgrades for
that car.  Admittedly, there's a 924 turbo, but it only provides as much
horsepower as a normally-aspirated '86 944, if I remember my numbers
right.  (About 160HP or some other ridiculously low number.)

Actually, I've seen a few.  Three different 911s, two 944s (one of which
was a turbo), and a 924S.  I passed the 924S handily, might I add; must be
driven by a real wuss.

I'm sure you can add an aftermarket turbo.  Not easily, but it could
probably be done.  (And, again, we run into the problem of "which decal do
I use *now*?")

I have to ask a question about this, too.  *Why* is the 968 unpopular?
The 944 was a roaring success.  What happened?  And why did Porsche run it
for so little time?  They don't really drop models until they stop
selling.  (The 911 is the perfect example of this.)

Huh.  You must not have the right turbo or something.  Admittedly, a
poorly-designed or old turbo can really detract from your driving
experience (example: the Ford Thunderbird, 0-60 in more than my normally
aspirated '79 924), but if you can get a good one or a twin turbo...

Well, I dunno.  I guess it's a matter of preference.
