Hello all...

I've been following this mailing list for a couple of months now, but
only this morning I have joined the PCA.  (Northern New Jersey Region).

My name is Sam Matthews, and I have an '88 944T, black with a Autothority
stage II chip.  This is my daily driver.  I also have a '94 Saab 900S
which is how the wife and kiddies (3) get around.

I've only had my car about 8 months and have enjoyed it a great deal.  I
have gone through bouts of wanting to sell it though, and perhaps getting
something even faster (a 3rd gen. RX-7).  Finally though I've decided
that what I really want to do is get involved with some PCA racing.  I've
had enough "weekday warrior-ing".  My car suddenly looks like a much
better choice.

One thing about my car I would like to change is the weight.  I've always
felt the car is kind of heavy.  The idea of replacing sheet metal with
fiberglass counterparts is intriguing.  One sales guy I talked to said I
could drop up to 800lbs.  It looks to me that the price would be approx.
$3K for nose, fenders, rear quarters, hood and doors.  Does anyone have
an experience doing this?  Sounds like an easy way (albeit not cheep) way
to make this car more nimble and quick.

Well I'm glad I joined, and am looking forward to the next NNJR-PCA
event. Yippie!
