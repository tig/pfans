Does anyone know what size wheel studs came on a stock 1986 951?  I bought a
used set of ARE wheels (TIRE RACK) from my best friend 2 years ago.  He had
them on a 1990 944S2, but they were put on by a wheel & tire shop in North
Carolina, and he has no idea what they did. I tried them on last year, but
they didn't quite clear the break calipers.  I got 1/2 inch spacers, but
could only get 6 or 7 turns on the lug nuts.  I'm told that 10-12 turns is
optimal.  I know that the wheel studs on the car are original, but I just
cannot get anyone here in Germany to tell me what size they are (you would
think that a Porsche dealer in GERMANY would know, but...).   

Thanks in advance.
