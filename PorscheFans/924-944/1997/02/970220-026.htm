  I was having problems also, but I went so far as to replace a good head
  gaskit, just so we could
  look inside I'll attach my reply to the 944s question and the heater
  core.

  Response is very lonnnnnng
  ____________________________________________________

  I am very interested in your temp gauge  fluctuations. Especially if it
  turns out to be
  related to your heater core, that's the only thing I haven't touched.

  I have a 86 951 and I have been having the problem for a year.

  The temp gauge on my 86 951  has two white lines to designate the normal
  range.
  The lower line is 80 degrees centigrade ( which is what the thermostat
  opens at)
  and the upper mark is 100 degrees centigrade which is waters boiling
  point.
  .
  My temperature gauge would only fluctuate between 8 minutes and 15
  minutes
  of highway 70 mph driving  then it would drop like a rock to the lower
  line 80 degree C.)

  Everyday it would get up to 80C. within three minutes. and stay there
  till 8 minutes of driving.
  At 8 minutes it would work its way up to 90C within 60 seconds. During
  the next 4 to 6 minutes
  it would bounce all over the place between 90 degrees and 100 degrees,
  finally around
  15 minutes of driving the gauge  would drop like a rock at 80C and stay
  there.

  Even if I drove for 3 hours after that the gauge wouldn't move off of the
  80 degree line.

  During the last year and a half, I replaced the thermostat twice, flushed
  and replaced the
  coolant twice, replaced the turbo water pump, the turbo thermostat,
  had the radiator overhauled, and the water pump replaced.

  I became so irritated I had the head gasket replaced last month with a
  Cup Car gasket.
  The mechanic that performed the work is a Porsche specialist, one of the
  best.
   He flushed the radiator, oil heat exchanger, and turbo inter cooler and
  the block twice.
   Said everything is now perfect. When he inspected the head it appeared
  maybe the
  coolant became contaminated with oil from the oil exchanger. he noticed
  hot spots on
  the head which caused premature wearing of the ceramic lining in the
  exhaust ports.

  My technician did state when everything was apart that
  there was a gummy substance on the oil heat exchanger,
  that might have been something like stop leak,
   that's the reason he flushed out all cores and did the radiator
  and block twice.
  the PO had water pump replaced a couple of months
  before he sold, maybe he tried to save money with stop leak.

  While the head was off, I had the entire head overhauled with new valves,
  seats,
  and guides and ceramic coating. Had the new valves done with a three
  angle
  competition cut. I had the head surfaced to increase my compression to
  8.5 to one.

  The resulting temperature gauge now is the car wants to idle at 90
  degrees instead
  of 80 degrees, The gauge still fluctuates now between 90 and 95, and then
  between
  85 and 90. then at 12 minutes of highway driving it settles in at 85
  degrees instead of
  80 degrees Which is less irritating. the range of highs and lows is not
  so great.

   I wonder now if it has more to do with the  oil temp getting above 80
  degrees and
  the cooling system is battling that effect from the oil cooler in the
  water jacket of the block.
  Then finally after 3 more minutes of driving the cooling systems has
  everything in check.
  and keeps it at 85 degrees. The 86 951's oil cooler is located just above
  the oil filter connection.
