Oh, yeah, the old integrity thing.   Rampant at dealerships.   Found
nowhere else.   Come on.

The dealer is the place to go.   Cheapest.

Let me see if I get this straight . . . . you had problems with the
aftermarket . . . 
but the dealer gets away with this without comment . . . . 

 Looked for loose vacuum lines and leaks per this

I REALLY don't follow this logic.   Lost boost follows weak mixtures.
