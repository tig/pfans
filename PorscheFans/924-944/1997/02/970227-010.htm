Hi everyone;

	Sorry, but I too cannot resist the temptation. First of all let me
tell you I LOVE THIS CAR. It has saved my butt on several occasions. The
most recent event occured about a month ago. I was in the left lane on a
major interstate (495 Virginia) crusing with the flow of the traffic
(about 80mph). As I came around the bend I noticed that several cars were
stopped up ahead. Fortunately there was no one right in front of me so I
slammed my brakes. But when I looked in the rear view mirror I was
horrified. The guy behind me was still comming full speed he did not see
what was up ahead. I was sure that I will be able to stop but I was not
sure about the the guy behind me. This left me with two options a) go on
the shoulder; b) go in the right lane. Well I had to scratch option a)
because I was on a bridge and there is no shoulder, just a huge concrete
median. Well I had no choice but to go with option b). I downshifted to
third, glanced over to right, floored it and switched lanes. 
	At this time I hear the guy behind be slam his brakes but it was
too late. He hammered into the back of one of the cars. All this happened
in a matter of few seconds. I was amazed at my reaction time but I was
even more amazed at how well the car performed all the tasks. I felt sorry
for the people in that mess, but I was so glad to have my car. I have
owned my car for almost 8 years but it never ceases to amaze me.


P.S. I have more stories but I don't want to bore plople to death.

 
have fun
