I haven't tried this but I understand that if you call PCNA with the VIN of 
the car in question they can research it for you and confirm/deny this. 
Sorry I don't have the number at hand--perhaps either another P-Fan or a 
copy of Panorama can help. //Pete Jones

>Hi-I'm a new member and am very close to purchasing a porsche.  I was
>looking for a little guidance from anyone that knows about the 1988 944
>Turbo S.  Specifically, the seller has told me that the car that I'm
>interested in is a limited edition of the Turbo S (he told me that there
>were less than 200 made).  It is a pinkish campaign color with a nasty
>plaid interior.  It also has the Turbo S wheels.  It is identical to the
>944 featured in the February 1988 edition of EXCELLECE. Can anyone tell
>me more about this car?  Is there such a thing as a limited edition
>Turbo S (i.e. what more does it have than the 944 Turbo S - other than
>the hideous interior)?  Will this car command a premium?  How much will
>a performance chip add to the value?  Is this a "Turbo Cup" car?  How
>can I be sure this is a Turbo S? Any information would be greatly
>appreciated.
