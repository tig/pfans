It has been suggested by a couple of list members that I might able to
eliminate both my occasional "dieseling" AND hot running engine by
addressing a possible "rich mixture" causing an accumulation of carbon in
the cylinders.

Since I am a shadetree mechanic at best and still learning, forgive me if I
ask some fundamental questions about how to eliminate the rich mixture (if
this is in fact my problem).

First of all, I assume the "rich mixture" is referring to having too much
fuel in the fuel/air mixture (Please correct me if I am wrong). List member
Dave Cooley suggested that this is "caused by a faulty temperature sensor
which is the primary input to the DME. Verified by a reistance check."

My questions are: How exactly is this 'resistance check' performed? What
special tools (if any) do I need? What is a normal reading? If I need a new
temperature sensor, how much do they generally cost? And is a temperature
sensor difficult for a shadetree mechanic to replace in a weekend?

I will greatly appreciate any helpful info.
