Alyn,

Just take a sheet of glass and some sand paper (can't remember what grit, but
not to course).  Put the sand paper on the glass, wet it, and holding the
brake pad, sand it down until it's flat.  The glass is used, because it will
give you a truely flat surface.

<< Dear Pfans
 
 My PO fitted new front discs(rotors) and pads and sensors all round. The 
 problem is that the rear pads bedded down on to the old discs and I have
just 
 replaced them. The old discs were pretty bad and wore the new pads unevenly
so 
 that the outer edges of the new discs are not being touched by the pads. Can

 anything be done or I am talking new pads even though the pads are only 1000

 miles or so old? I think I know the answer but it seems such a waste!
 
 Thanks
 
 Alyn
