Is there any way to adjust the brake and accelerator pedal more level ???  I,m still 
having a hard time getting the accel blipped when braking hard.. I try to make it a 
rule not to downshift unless my foot is on the brake . Also, I like to keep my heel 
on the floor board. I just can't seem to get this accomplished with my S2-- 
especially with the power brakes. On my "old" 911, I've got a heel stop and the 
pedals are level with one another.. It also helps that it has NO power brakes- it 
takes a heafty push to get it up to max braking and hold it there !!!!! The only 
thing I can see to do is to add a alum plate with another accelerator pedal on top 
of it.  Does anyone have a better solution. It seems that there must be someone who 
has solved this problem before !!!! Thanks for any help..
