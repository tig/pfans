     Alex -
     
     read your note about suspension adjustment on a 944 and had a 
     question.
     
     I am planning to lower my car tomorrow (actually I started the process 
     yesterday, and only got the front done) but can't see how to lower the 
     rear.
     
     I have an 89 951 with the 030 option.  I have studied the rear 
     suspension (visually that is) but cant tell what the proper approach 
     is.  Here what I was thinking...
     
     1.  with the car on jack stands, remove wheels...
     
     2.  scratch my head
     
     3.  try loosening a few bolts on the trailing arm - I think someone 
     told me once that one of the bolts is "concentric" and can be adjusted 
     "slightly".  I figure that I will have to loosen a few bolts so that 
     the concentric one can then be moved..
     
     4.  Use a floor jack positioned under some part of the suspension to 
     raise that corner while I retighten the bolts.
     
     5.  Scratch my head when parts start falling off...
     
     
     TIA for any help,
