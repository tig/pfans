I have put the Pirelli Winter Ices (new tire this year) on my 968 this =
year.  This is the first year I have driven the Porsche during the =
winter here in Minnesota (as this is the first year I have owned it) and =
in the snows we have had so far, the car and tires are working very =
well.  I highly recommend the tires although I will say they are very =
soft and do squirm quite a bit but that is to be expected form a tire =
that does well in snow.

P-Fans,

I need recommendations for winter/cold weather tires for my Boxster. The
Pirelli's let me down, (OK I made a stupid move), and spun the Boxster
off the road. Now he waits in at the body shop for parts.

I want to find a good all around cold weather tire. One for use on cold
(less then 40 degree) roads,  occasional rain and light snow. I will not
be driving it in the snow less I ABSOLUTELY have to.

I want to stay with factory wheel, Dyno's specifically, which are 17"

Any comments, recommendation etc will be GREATLY appreciated!

JOHN

PS:  911 fans, please give a Boxster onwer posting  to your board, BUT
I know there has to be many knowledgable people with 911 that can help
answer my questions. This is the FIRST winter for the Boxster!
