For those of us close to Montana who enjoy the wide open highways, using
a 1/100th of a second stop watch and survey markers to calibrate the
speedometer my 88 951S did 168mph (165 actual) down a hill and 160
actual on the straight with 80,000 miles. Then the copsdrove by the
other way. I asked my buddy if the cop saw us - he said yes, then I
asked him if the cop knew we were speeding :-)  It was just after sun
rise (~6 am) and the road was ,of course, clear. The bottom line is that
nobody was waiting for us down the road so apparently he didn't think it
was a problem. Now that I have chips for my car (thanks Dan) I'm curious
to see how it does.

84 944
88 951S

PS, I've never bee able to get my 84 944 over 125 actual mph (ie:
calibrated).
