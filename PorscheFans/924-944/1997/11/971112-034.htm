Ok guys lets talk about reliability,

I drove an 83 - 944 from birth of car. It had problems, they were:
1.	Water pump  leaked at 75k
2.	Radio attena failed at 12k and 25k (after that I learned how to
rebuild them)
3.	Rear wheel bearing went at 85k
4.	Parking brake never really  worked
5.	The seat broke when it crashed at Watkins Glenn (so did the
whole back end of the car).

Then I got an 87 also from birth. It had the following

1.	Oil cooler seals leaked at 30k
2.	DME failed at 20k
3.	Water pump leaked at 80k
4.	Belt broke at 80k
5.	Clutch broke at 110k (Bad shift on track)
6.	Belt broke at 113k
7.	Parking brake still does not work


	Yes I ran the 83 on the track, lots of drivers ed. And don't run
the 87 other than daily driver. And when the 944 is in the ship I drive
the914 Track car around. No air, heat, radio, or power anything but
always runs and is great fun to drive on the street.

	So all in all I have been happy with both cars, but the 83 was
by far the better put together car.

and now 83-944 & Love to find an 80's Suburban with clam shell doors)
	BTW: My insurance man really loves me !!

	Maybe I'm just lucky when it comes to my car,(88-951) but I am
suprised
	when people say that our cars need repairs all the time. (Mitch
Fugit) If
	my mechanic made the comment about keeping another car for a
daily driver,
	I would be looking for another mechanic. I've driven mine (my
only car) for
	2 1/2 years and it hasnt left me stranded yet. The only major
repair was
	the clutch fork breaking( this seems rare) and I could still
drive the car
	to the shop. I agree that repair costs are high( ever fix a
bimmer?) but I
	dont see them needing repairs any more than any other high
mileage car. (My
	Honda CRX left me stranded twice after 60000 miles) I think the
key is a
	knowlegable mechanic(mine was a dealership watercooled
specialist for 15
	years) and not letting anything go until it breaks. Again, maybe
I'm  just
	lucky, but I have no reason not to trust my car. I would
however, be
	reluctant to buy a pre 85 1/2 because I think the kinks were
worked out in
	later models.
