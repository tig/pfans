I have a 1985/2 944 and am concerned about how hot the engine has been running.

During a typical drive the guage hovers around the 2/3rds mark--often
rising too close to the red for my comfort (please visit
http://www.ruffolo.com/944/problems to see a diagram). This is ALWAYS the
case whether the outside temperature is 85 degrees F, or 30 degrees
F...whether I'm on the expressway, or in the city.

In September I had the fan switch checked and the thermostat replaced. Two
weeks ago the waterpump was replaced (and updated). Could my problem be a
clogged or otherwise faulty radiator? This is the only other thing I can
think of.

What bigger problems (if any) might be caused by operating my car at these
temperatures?

If my problem is the radiator, how difficult is it for a (very) junior
mechanic with limited tools to replace? I'd like to do it myself since I've
been spending so much money on my car lately, but I don't want to get in
over my head. The Haynes manual and shop manuals don't make it look too
difficult--but then again they never do.

Also, I've seen a redesigned, high-capacity 944 radiator contructed of
brass and copper (instead aluminum and plastic) advertised in the
Performance Products catalog. They claim significantly higher heat
dissipation. Does anybody know if it is worth the $460 price tag? And is it
available for 1985/2 and later models?

Thanks,
NEIL
