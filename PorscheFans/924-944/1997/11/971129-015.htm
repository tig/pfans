Hi, Bob,

This sounds really weird...

1) Are you sure that your car is a 1983?  Does the VIN contain
WP0AA.....DN...... or does it contain WP0AA.....EN......, etc?

2) Where does the 85-86 fan relay plug in? Is the fuse box up on=20
top, near the windshield wiper motor, or is it underneath the dash,
near the clutch pedal?

?????

Good Luck!
