Myles,
 
They didn't jig it to anything before they started welding it.  Man, I
would get them to replace it or promise to replace it if it blows again.
I guess it might not be that bad, but under heat I think that could be
lots of stress on the manifold.  
 
I let someone weld some cracks on the rear seal part of my rear main cap
once.  The cap was still usable, but he bent the rear seal part about ten
degrees.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed on that one...
 
Good luck,
Dave
 
PS all you list people have a nice weekend.  Don't drive too fast.  I
might be coming the other way.
