If you are putting a Turbo engine in your car, why not keep the Turbo 
flywheel on it too?

The Turbo flywheel will mate with a standard Turbo clutch, but I would 
spend the extra money and get a Turbo Cup clutch.

Also, if you are still in the planning stages, I would recommend finding 
a running Turbo that has been crashed as a donor car.  This way you can 
have the whole drive train, wiring harness, cooling system, exhaust 
system, suspension, brakes, and all the other tid bits that you will need.
