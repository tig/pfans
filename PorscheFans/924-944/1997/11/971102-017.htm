Thanks to Bob I am now at least getting some ideas. He suggested that the
DME has gone bad and that experienced the same symptoms. Well I dont know
how to check the DME other than buying a new one but that would really suck
if it turns out not to be the problem.
I tried to get back in touch with Bob about this but he hasnt replied yet so
I decided to ask here.
I found a DME relay in the fuse/relay box. I took the cover off the relay to
check it. When the ignition is off the relays are open. When I turn the
ignition on they remain in the same position. Then when I try to start the
engine the relays still remain open. Does that mean my DME is bad? I would
think that since thats the DME relay that it would do something but its not.
I guess it could be the relay itself. If it is the relay then is there a way
to jumper it so I can see if its the relay or the DME itself?

My main question is, shouldnt that DME relay do something other than sit
there in the open position. If I can find that out then I may be on my way
to finding the problem.

Quick responses would be greatly appreciated.
