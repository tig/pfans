Folks,

I've been reading the oversteer "spinning" thread with interest.
Craig Sekos's post included two accurate comments: "Oversteer
in a 944 is a lot closer than you think - drive an autocross
and you'll see" and later in his post (Nov 28 Digest) "944
oversteer ... *is* there, it *will* crop up in conditions ..."

I drove a front-wheel-drive (fwd) car for over a decade before buying
my 944 S2.  In fwd, power understeer coming out of a turn is the
rule - in our cars, one can get either understeer, or oversteer
depending on road conditions, when and how briskly the power is
applied, what gear is selected and where one is on the torque curve when
the throttle goes down.  Autocross IS an excellent way to gain
better driving skills and learn how the thing behaves when it's
coming loose (or understeering as well).

I have almost no experience with altering car set-up, but will pass
along my experience with my car's tires, because it still confuses me.
I'd love to hear some feedback on this.  My car is a 1990 S2 (Cabriolet).
At purchase it had Goodrich Comp TA ZR street tires (245) on the rear,
and lesser Goodrich VR (205) up front.  In the 1990 model year, Porsche
changed the rear suspension settings from the 89 year.  Specifically,
a larger sway bar in the rear,  more negative camber in the rear
(-45' vs -30' for '89).  They also increased the rear tire pressure
to 40 psi.  The following year ('91) the rear tire pressure spec
was reduced to 36psi (fronts are speced at 36psi for both years).

I ran the car at the spec tire pressures for a few months, and it
simply doesn't work.  The rear was loose and very prone to both power
and brake induced oversteer.  After dropping the rear pressure to 36psi,
the car stuck better and exhibited the mild understeer characteristic
of the 944.  That the car didn't work with 40psi in the back is no
surprise -- at replacement, those tires were badly worn on inside
with almost no wear on the outside.  There was simply not much
tire in contact with the road.  I've since fiddled with the pressures
at both ends.  The rear loosens up at about 38-39 psi (cold).

So why did Porsche increase the rear tire pressures?  In fact the
changes in the rear suspension and settings from 89-90 are a bit
confusing.  The stiffer sway bar would accentuate oversteer, the
increased rear negative camber would decrease it, and the increased
tire pressure would be expected to decrease oversteer IF it was
within the functioning limits of the tire patch.  But, as I've
noted 40psi just didn't leave much rubber on the road.

Unlike many sedans, the 944 is not engineered to avoid oversteer at
all costs -- it's a well-balanced car that allows the driver to
control steering with brake and throttle (as well as steering lock)
and I gather that this is the design intention.  In fact, the slight
oversteer induced by trail braking into corners (and I don't mean
hanging the tail out, but rather the slight swaying feel that comes
with mild oversteer) is one of the interesting parts of running the
car briskly into moderate speed corners.

Yes, stomping on the brakes in a medium fast turn WILL slide the back
out.  And jamming the throttle to the floor from 4000 rpm in second
gear in the rain WILL push it out by more than a slight step.  And
too, as previously noted, the correction from this first tail wag can
wag the tail in the other direction (yes - I've done that on the
street, in the rain, and was spared only by grace ...).  

I'm still very much learning to drive, and auto-x is a brilliant
venue for that.  I highly suggest it for those folks that are
interested in more experience with the car at the brink of sliding
(and sometimes past the brink ...)

I'd welcome feedback on any of this.  Happy driving to all.
