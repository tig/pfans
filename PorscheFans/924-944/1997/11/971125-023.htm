I like Dana's post.  In the 2.5 years I had my 944S, I managed to kick the
tail out twice on street conditions without trying to.  Both cases
involved wierd weather conditions which led to localized moisture patches
on the pavement (right on the curve, unfortunately).

It did not help that I still had the really bad Pirelli P500 tires
installed by the PO.  I replaced those tires with D40 M2 tires and got wet
performance that rivaled or exceeded the dry performance of most daily
drivers I have been in (my car was stock with no ABS and no sport
suspension option except the addition of an 18mm rear sway bar).  In
short, the car felt like the safest car to be in when the going got tough.
Respect these cars by keeping them in good condition and they will take
care of you.  Check out Bill Underwood's story about launching a 944 off
of a mountain if you are not convinced yet.

Nah, they would not care at all about something like this, the car is not
in production any more.
