The front shocks adjust with a knob from the top of the strut.  
There is a rubber cap which you can pull off to reveal the adjuster.
Counter-clockwise for stiffer.  The rears have to be removed and 
compressed all the way to engage the adjustment mechanism.
The shocks are only adjustable for rebound.  I have a 93 with the
M030 and the ride is stiff compared to my 240SX but I got used to 
it after a couple of weeks.  Ride height is adjustable in the front
through the treaded spring perches and the rear height is done by 
the usual 944 method.  You need to find someone with scales to 
properly corner balance the car.  Front camber and caster is 
adjustable through the clevis bolts on the strut and through 
eccentrics on the A-arm.  Rear camber is adjustable like the 944
and the rear sway bar also has 3 holes for the drop links to adjust
rear roll stiffness.  Congrats on your purchase.  It is a great car.

which

(too

suspensions.

anything
