Have to say I would like a second opinion. What with 0.07 a litre
difference.
 
Speeking of head work, does anybody know of any differences between a
Series I
and Series II 931 head?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I think headwork for unleaded has to do with valve seating problems.  The
turbos had hardened seats; if the NA's had the same, I'd drive it until it
needed a valve job anyway. 
 
I was also pretty sure the I and II heads were the same.  I know the
turbos are different (the american market had the smaller turbine housing
for all years), crankcase breathing was improved on series II, and series
II uses digital ignition. Oh, and the tranny...
