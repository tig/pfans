Jon and all:

IMO.... 968 hands down!  for exactly the opposite reason Daniel Freedman
states.  At the club races I've attended, F is generally one of the biggest
classes.  F also has a wide variety of cars so regardless of your
experience/ability level, you will most likely have people to race (play)
with.  At a track that favors HP, it may be tough to beat a well
driven/set-up C2 or C4, but on tracks that favor an excellent handling car,
the 968 should do very well.  Be prepared to spend the $'s on M030 brakes,
limited slip, and all the good suspension goodies.

If '95 993's are moved to D, the 944TS should be very competitive as well.
Barry is correct that this car is already track ready as it came from the
factory... However,  I think the very competitive cars are set-up far
beyond factory stock.  If you set up your car well and are a very good
driver, would still be lot's of fun... just not as many people to play with.

Please let the list know what you decide.

>Neither  ...>
