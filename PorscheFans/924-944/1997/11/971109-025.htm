The alternator on my '87 944 died last week, and I had an interesting time
sourcing a rebuilt unit.  First stop the dealer (Stevens Creek VW/Porsche, San
Jose), price $520 for rebuilt.  Second stop Automotion, list price $200 for
rebuilt, but sale going on so price was $160.  But they did not have a unit
to rebuild in stock, and it would have taken 2 weeks to rebuild my own
alternator.  Next check EASY in Berkeley; $70 for used unit with 100 day
warranty.  I had originally taken the car to PEP Boys (!!) to have the
charging system checked; so just for laughs I asked them if they carried
944 alternators.  They did, and the price was $159 without any exchange
necessary.  Anyway, 2 hours later I had put it in myself...  I am looking
forward to the next couple of years of much cheaper ownership on this car.
