> Barry,
> 
> I was cruising the P-fans list and saw the post. The EGR thing is a
> static amount of burned gasses that remain in the cylinder dur to
> valve-overlap and timing. ALL engines produce this, though racing grinds
> have more overlap and generate a lot of burned gasses. This effectively
> increases the amount of "EGR" that takes place. David is correct in
> stating that reduced backpressure alters the amount of burned gases that
> remain. But the main issue is the change in the intake profile that
> results and how the DME reacts to it.
> 
> Reduced backpressure actually affects the O2 sensor in that a reduced
> temperature occurs. The O2 sensor must be heated to operate. This is not
> a problem with many US and California cars that have heated O2 sensors. 
> 
> If the backpressure is reduced in a stock engine, fuel economy and
> driveability can be affected. For example, if you opt to use equal
> length headers on a stock 944 in place of the Tri-Y factory
> configuration, you will lose some midrange torque and horsepower. You
> will get a little improvement at top end, but certainly not enough to
> warrant the effort and expense. If you put a straight pipe in place of
> the catalyst, you will get a less restrictive path, but if you had taken
> a bad catalyst and punched the material out, you would have a slight
> improvement. This is because of the octave tuning of the system. 
> 
> I could go on, but to correct what David said, there is not really and
> EGR system here. There is, however, a known amount of burned gases that
> do remain in the normal process. 
> 
> BTW, the primary reason for EGR is to REDUCE the peak temperature during
> combustion to minimize the formation of NOX, another pollutant. The DME
> is designed, in the application of the MAP information, to prevent the
> condition from occuring. 
> 
> My messages keep getting bounce from the list, so you can forward it if
> you like.
