Help!

I am preparing for my first club race in less than three weeks, and
realize that my control arms probably aren't up to the task.  The car is
an 89 951, completely stock.

I have heard Fabcar is the only way to go for a track car, but the cost
is $$$.  In addition, Kelly Moss racing is HIGHLY recommending that I
NOT use stock Delrin (sp?) bushings, but instead upgrade to an improved
bushing (super cool, CNC, ultra fast, machined this and that...) that
cost $700 big ones.  Alltogether that adds up to $2,300 smackers ($700 +
$800 x 2).  

That combination makes the stock Control Arms at about $400 each sound
good, and like I could replace a few of them before paying off the
Fabcar units.  Or should I be looking at the Club Sport control arms
from Porsche ($500 each)?

The labor to replace the control arms looks fairly simple - a hack
mechanic like myself will probably only spend 3 or 4 days cursing it
before having it flatbedded to a real mechanic.

Any thoughts?  Anyone with some used Fabcar units for sale?  Bushings?
Anybody?  Anybody?  Bueller?

TIA
