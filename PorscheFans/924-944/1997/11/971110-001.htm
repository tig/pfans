Tom, I see you are in Redmond, and being in the area myself (Bainbridge
Island) I am guessing you are getting stuff from Barrier Porsche in Bellevue.
I noticed in excellence magazine (November 1997 issue) that they claim they
will "match any advertised prices on genuine factory parts" Don Mcgill
porsche in texas, which advertises prices in Excellence, is, I think, a
dealer also, and their prices in the printed ads are quite competitive. I
recently ordered hood struts from them, no problem. I also held Barrier to
their offer on a 944 manual set, which I got for 219., the best price I could
find in Excellence, since Barrier had them in stock, which is next day UPS to
the island. Hope this tip saves you some bucks, it should. Also, current Don
McGill  ad prices for brake pads: (says all parts are Porsche factory
original)
89 944T front pads# 993-351-939-01 = $99.00
86-89 944T rear pads#964-351-939-03 = $45.95
I don't know if either have the wires.
