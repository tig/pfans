Ok, this may sound like a stupid question but with all this talk about
speed I have to ask.

One time I had the (questionably) fine idea of driving the car faster than
the speed limit.  I had removed the sunroof before starting the trek and
at 125mph I thought the rear hatch glass was going to pop off!!  The air
entering through the sunroof seemed to want to open the hatch whichever
way it could.  Was I being paranoid in my attempt to maintain the
integrity of the car or could the glass really have removed itself from
the frame?  I did not have any water leaks in the car, so the seals in the
hatch were strong (or strong enough).

Just curious.  And yes, I did immediately slow down to the speed limit.
