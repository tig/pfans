I've got the same setup as your friend on my S2, with the exception of
Turbo Cup springs on the front (160-410 lb). I had the same concern about
oversteer with the 29 mm torsion bars, but after 3 time-trial events, I
found that the car was still neutral, and the reduction in body roll
inspired more confidence in the corners.  I was afraid of the car at first,
but now that I've done a few high-speed, 180 degree sweepers and found I
could easily modulate turning with the throttle w/out breaking the rear end
out, I like the setup.  

If you have the Weltmeister adjustable rear sway bar, you have the ability
to tune front/rear stiffness more than I do ( I have the 19mm rear sway
from the 968).
The 29 mm torsion bars will make the street ride stiffer, but I've done
1500 mile drives w/out really noticing it. If you're setting up primarily
for the track, they are not a problem.

I guess the thing to consider is the 250 lb springs in front and the 29mm
torsion bars in the rear. I don't know how that equates to the progressive
springs I've got w/ a stiffer final lbs/in, but if your friend's car feels
good to you, that should tell you something.  A few 951 drivers in my PCA
region use 27-28mm torsion bars and do fine. Had one drive my S2, and he
thought it handled very well.  

The choice of torsion bars is indeed a pain. Once they're in, it costs a
lot of time/money to change them.
