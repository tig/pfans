I am at the end of my Rope here. I recently purchased a 1986 944. The =
car had a problem that I was aware of when I bought it. It only started =
when it wanted to :)
You could drive all day sometimes with no problems. Then go in =
somewhere, come back out and try to start and it would just sit there =
and turn over and over. Sometimes letting it sit for a few minutes would =
work. It would start like there where no problems at all. I dont think =
the problem is related to heat. The car could sit all night and I would =
go to start it in the morning and sometimes it would start and sometimes =
it wouldnt.
Anyway this problem got worse. The car would stop running while I was =
driving. Im talking instant death as if someone had reached down and =
shut he ignition off. I could coast over the the shoulder and let it sit =
for a few minutes, sometimes longer sometimes less, and it would start =
again like there had never been a problem. Sometimes this would happen =
4-6 times in a day and sometimes not at all.
I took it to a shop in a Jackson MS called German Motor Werks. The =
mechanic Scott Spense said he could fix it. He is supposedly the best in =
my area. He called me a couple of days later and said he found the =
problem. He insisted that it was bad contacts in the alarm relay. He =
said he cleaned them and that it was working fine now. I went to pick my =
car up after hours. Got in a turned the key and it just sat there and =
would spin over and over like always. I let it sit and it finally =
started.
I got home and that same day the car got to where it would just not =
start at all. To this day it still will not start. The mechanic said I =
would have to order a new alarm relay so I got him to order me one. The =
new relay was installed but it did not fix a damn thing.
I really need advice on this. I have spent alot of money on a part that =
didnt fix anything and labor that didnt fix anything.
I just want the car fixed.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I really like this car but =
since I bought it I have maybe 4 hours of driving time in it.

Syptoms again are.
1. at first would only start when it wanted to. Just spinning over.
2. Would stop running while I was driving. Like someone turned the =
ingition off.
3. Now it wont even start.
