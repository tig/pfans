>I enter that straight after a third gear
90 degree corner and if I came onto the straight pushing the front end
enough to drift a couple feet I would get to the braking for the next
corner just as third gear touched or neared the rev limiter.  Meaning I
didn't have, prior to today, enough power to get into fourth no matter
how hard I pushed the corner prior.  TODAY, I went through there again,
didn't push the previous corner very hard and found that I run out of
third gear about 30 yards short of the braking marker (a tree).  So
verdict is, the extra compression and cleaned up valves helped.  I go
through third from 3500 to redline about a third quicker. <

Bill,

We are all delighted that your car runs but what about your girlfriend? =

Has she reviewed our resumes  to determine which one of us will replace
you?  A girlfriend that is preconditioned to Porsche ownership and an emp=
ty
garage what a combination!  BTW is it a two car garage?
