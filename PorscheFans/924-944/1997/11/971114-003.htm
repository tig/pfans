Aha! Somebody else saw 'Top Gear' last night as well, Well all I can say is
that I was told my 931 wouldn't convert without major head work. But I have
run the car on unleaded for a short time, when I was in Germany, no bad affects.

Have to say I would like a second opinion. What with 0.07 a litre difference.

Speeking of head work, does anybody know of any differences between a Series I
and Series II 931 head?

P.S.  Why can't they bring back 5 Star!
