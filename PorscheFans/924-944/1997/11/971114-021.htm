Well, thanks to all that helped me out via this list.  The car is back
together and here is the update that was requested by several.  New head
gasket, waterpump, cooler seals, throttle position switch, lapped valves
and 1/2 milimeter off the head and she's running great.  BTW, I also
disassembled and cleaned the auxillery air valve, or idle controller, or
whatever you want to call that thing under the intake manifold.

There was a discussion ongoing about what my Porsche mechanic told me
about the balance shaft belt tension.  Here is the outline of what he
told me when he retensioned the belts yesterday.  Rotate the engine one
full revolution after putting belts and everything on.  Check to be sure
the pulleys are all in proper alignment.  Rotate the engine back 1 1/2
teeth on camshaft to put any slack on the other side of the camshaft and
insert one rediculously expensive guage to the right of the the
Camshaft.  (Next part not in the book, but taught by porsche) Without
moving the system exert pressure on the rachet moving the crankshaft
until higher numbers read on guage then SLOWLY release tension.  This
gives a 'true' reading of the tension on the belt.  He then set it to
3.0 on the guage.  

BALANCE SHAFT BELT.  Here's the new stuff.  He doesn't use the guage on
that belt, instead uses the 90 degree twist test.  If it will twist 90
degrees with your fingers, then it's fine.  The idler pulley doesn't
touch that belt, but it's close.  He said that the belts tend to whine a
LOT if tensioned by porsche standards, and the pulley is 'supposed' to
induce a 2 degree deflection by Porsche word, but he finds it makes too
much noise, and it's purpose is to stop the belt from hitting the bolt
to the right and beneath that idler, and it does so without having to
touch it all the time.  

So that's it.  It runs great, not a bit of belt noise and I'm smiling
ear to ear because I did it myself.  I couldn't have done it without
this list and the help of the dozen or so of you who answered all of my
questions.  Thank you all very much.

I'd love to stay and type more, but hear that???  It's my car calling
from the garage....it says  'Favorite twisties Bill, lets go to our
favorite twisties'.  Who am I to argue with that?
