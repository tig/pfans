Marshall -
	What you're looking for is a Blaupunkt BEA 80. A ten band
equalizer/amp. OE for the ten speaker system sold in these cars - at least
in 1989. I recently installed a Kenwood that had four RCA outputs, TheBEA
80 only has a nine pin DIN connector. Fortunately I saved my DIN female
from the original Porsche CD player. The BEA 80 has a male DIN connector
where eight wires are for the speakers line level inputs, and the ninth
wire is for the power sensing from the head unit. The BEA 80 has seperate
power  connections on it's back panel.
	I also believe the unit was installed in the 944 cars with a facia
plate the allows the unit to fill the console hole just below the head unit.
	Now my ten speaker 944 is again sounding great. You see I drove the
car for almost a year without the equalizer. Wow did it sound poor. I
didn't think the BEA 80 would work, but on a whim gave it a try! Glad I did.
