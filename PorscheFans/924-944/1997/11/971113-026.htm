Hi,
I got to the alternator to find an external connection bad.  it is clearly
shown in the Haynes, but not referenced.  It's on the leftmost side of the
alt. and has a L-shaped female spade connector at one end, followed by  1
inch of wire, terminating at a black plastic "box" that is attached to the
alt. with a small flat bracket and screw.  The plastic "box" was cracked
and had fallen away, dangling by the connection at the other end.  I pulled
the piece from my parts car and installed it.

Across the battery terminals:
12.52 v running
12.41 v running w/ lights
12.25 v running w/ lights and cooling fans

I don't get that 14 -15 volts that Haynes says I should but the battery
didn't start out with quite a full charge.
So what do you think?  Problem solved?

TIA

Thanks,

Stuart
