According to the parts microfiche, M220  (limited slip differential) was
available on 924 cars
as early as 1979, perhaps earlier.

Good Luck!

Subject: Rear wheels acting strangely


|OK, without getting into the background: my car was stuck in the snow and
|I was watching the rear wheels spin from inside the car.  (Don't ask.)
|However, something strange that I noticed is that I could hear the
|spinning sound but the wheel I was looking at wasn't moving.  I made sure
|the clutch was out all the way and that the screaming sound wasn't the
|clutch exploding (the car drives fine, by the way) and, when I gave the
|car more gas, the wheel did indeed turn.  Again, I could hear the other
|wheel spinning the whole time.
|
|You first thought (might) be: so what, it's limited slip.  But I have a
|'79 924 and, to my knowledge, no 924's came with LSD even as an option.
|
|I figure I must have overlooked something obvious, like a broken axle.
|(Well, maybe not *that* obvious.)  Is this supposed to happen?  Is it
|indicative of some sort of problem (like the transmission being only
|loosely attached on the left side)?  (God, I hope not.  That would be a
|nightmare.)  Again, the car drives perfectly normally.
|
|Any help, especially with explanations if it's not LSD (which must be the
|case), would be much appreciated.
