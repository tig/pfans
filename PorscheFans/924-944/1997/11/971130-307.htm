Correct, however the 928 offsets were 65mm front and 52,3mm rear.

>(the 911 phone dials fit the early 944's) Is this correct?

Correct,  I think almost all offsets, 10.6mm-23.3mm and 36mm Fuchs were
listed as fitments for pre 86 944s. (George B is the authority on this, I
believe. He may shed more light on this)   

>I have the part number which is 928.361.016.00.  The local Porsche dealer
was of no >help and did not have any info as to the offset of the wheel.

928.361.016.00 is a 7JX16 wheel with 65mm offset. It will work on the 87up
944 cars with 52,3mm offsets.  (incidentally, I think this wheel was used
on the front of a 928. The rear was an 8JX16 - 52.3mm offset with p/n
951.362.116.01)     

>I need help.  Has anyone used 928 offset wheels on their 944?  Do the 928's
>fit the later model 944 with the 52 mm offset?   

Yes, I use the forged S4 wheels on my 87 951.  I also use 928 cast winter
wheels with 65mm  offsets (p/n 928.362.114.20) without any problems.
