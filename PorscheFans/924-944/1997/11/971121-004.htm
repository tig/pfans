Alex hi,

I had the same problem with my old 924, when cornering at speed the oil &
brake light would come on. My mechanic told me that this could be due to
a couple of reasons, but the most likely was that the oil in the sump being
forced away from the collector for the oil pump when I cornered sharply. He
also said that I could probably fix this by fitting a sump with baffles.

(Anyone else heard of these things?)

Have to say I didn't follow this up as shortly afterwards some 17 year old
T-boned the 924 :( and my 931 does not seem to have the same problem. Just
on my second engine rebuild this year!

Regards

        Richard.
