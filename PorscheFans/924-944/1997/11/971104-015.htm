Ok I have finally decided to participate. I used to have a 924 that turned
out to be a MAJOR money pit. Everything that could go wrong with that thing
did go wrong and with vengence. I got rid of the car swearing that I would
never never again own a Porsche. Well I have put a number of miles on a
friends Mitsu-3000 GT/SL and decided that perhaps another sporty car was in
my future but no Porsches!! 
Ok now fast forward to the present, I am driving up the strip looking at
cars for sale without any real intentions. I pass a lot with a pretty red
944. I look,go back and drive. I like the old familiar feel (though not as
fast as the 3000). The car has since been sold but now I find myself
looking for a nice 944. I have read the faq's and have been lurking around
here but what I really need is some input. Just how unreliable and
expensive have all your cars been? I plan on keeping other car(s) but am I
going to be going broke trying to keep a 944 on the road?

Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any feedback.
Dave
