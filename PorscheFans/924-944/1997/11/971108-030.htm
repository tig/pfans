Maybe the 968 owner thought your car was another 944 variant (S2 or even
base model??).  While driving my 951 (stage II) around town, I've been
challenged by a few 911 owners in the same fashion (owners insist on having
the "real" Porsche).  When they finally catch up to me at the next
stoplight, their whole attitude seems to change and they always smile and
try and play off their defeat with cheerful chit-chat about what an
excellent marque Porsche is, etc.
        The 944 turbo can be a real sleeper because of its close resemblance
to the other, less-powerful 944 models.  Have fun folks, and keep our
Porsche brothers and sisters in check!
