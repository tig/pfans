Ok, on my next order of Porsche parts from Anywhere Inc.  I'll get that
flywheel lock that so many of you suggested.  I received an email from
Dave first, and it said 'Don't worry about the case' and use a big
screwdriver.  I immediately jumped for joy and ran back to the garage. 
After inserting the girlfriend under the several thousand pound
automobile and assuring her that it won't fall on her unless I will it
to, she held the 3/4" chisel (hardened better than a screwdriver) in the
teeth of the flywheel and around front I went.  My only concern was the
breaker bar.  Actually it's more like a breaker twig.  Only about 8
inches long and put over my 1/2" socket wrench I was a bit skeptical as
to being able to put enough force on it.  BUT, I slowly increased
pressure and just before causing a hernia, it came off.  Call me lucky,
no call me deserving, if you knew what I went through to get that damn
lower balance shaft pulley off you'd say I deserved a break too. Anyway,
as I promised, Dave you are a genius.  As well as Ezra, Stu, Jim, Chris,
and Frank.  Thanks all for your input.  I will buy that flywheel tool,
if for nothing else than piece of mind and keeping the girlfriend off
the floor.  (wait a minute)

Dave, I showed the girlfried your response and she read my proposal to
offer her as reward.  She gave me a funny look and said 'Fine, have the
ones who respond forward a resume and I'll choose your replacement.' 
So, uh, well send in your info and we'll see if she bites.  She does
hold a screwdriver very well.  :)  

Bill
85.5 944   -  finally on its way back together.
