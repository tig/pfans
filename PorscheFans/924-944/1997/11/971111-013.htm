All this talk about top speed, who raced who ect reminds me of something
that happened about 7yrs ago. I was in my Mustang GT and a friend was in his
Grand National, we were coming back from a round of golf; he looked at me, I
at him and we were at 125 in no time. Then something happened... COMMON
SENSE! We were in the wrong place for the game we were playing. 

If you guys want to race, go to the track. I do not want some jerk (yes I
was one) losing control of their car and end up in my lane. How fast have I
gone? Very fast. Speed is like other things "relative" what is fast for me
may not be fast for you, drive 80 in the left lane, no problem. Top your car
out on a public road-> problem. I have spent a good deal of time on the
track on motorcycles and driving Porsches this is the proper place to top
out your toy. Using simple math 120mph = 176 ft/sec, sorry I don't trust too
many people's reflexes at that rate of speed so use some judgment. I know
this has probably been beaten to death by now but hey I'm bored at work.

Another question: How many of you had the correct rated tires for you speed
runs? I hope you at least had this one right. IMHO speed in a straight line
is boring, go fast in the corners, on the track where it belongs.
