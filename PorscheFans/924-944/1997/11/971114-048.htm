Neither  ...

	To fast, to expensive to repair, too much compition.

	The way to pick a class to compete in is to look at where the
compition is lightest.

	For what a single off-road excursions would cost in either one
of those cars you could buy, build-up, and race a 914.

	But if you are already a good racer with deep pockets the turbo
would be more fun maybe not a winner but the top end is cool.

	Expect the car to be hurt, forget the concept of insurance,
price out the motor and body work, look deep into your pocket, and then
look at your families needs.
