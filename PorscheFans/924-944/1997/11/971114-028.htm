I am disturbed by what appears to have happened in our wonderful group =
over the last few days.
I have always respected Farzaan as he is very knowledgeable about the =
951 and always backs up his statements with proof (i.e. dyno results =
etc.) I have always thought that this group was a place where we could =
all discuss these cars and help eachother out with any problems =
technical or otherwise. Farzaan took an immense amount of time to write =
his post on how boost control works for the 951. For anyone to attack =
him for making small errors is ridiculus. One thing I have discovered in =
the year I've owned my car (85.5 NA) is that no one seems to know =
everything about it. Farzaan knows a hell of a lot more than most =
people, and has taken the time to try and help other people understand =
these cars better. This deserves commendation, not an attack because his =
post wasn't perfect. If someone finds an error in a post, the polite =
thing to do is notify the list as to the error, not rip the poster apart =
for making it. Does Steve know everything about this car? I doubt it. If =
you noticed an error in Farzaan's post you should have just said "hey =
isn't it really like this, because that is what I've seen," not insult =
him. I don't see Steve writing any three part explanations to help out =
questions many of the listmembers have. Maybe instead of wasting time =
ripping people apart, we should be either: driving these cars, or =
posting things to help eachother out, which is indeed the purpose of =
this list. I think the response to Farzaan's posting was childish and =
immature (this is ironic I'm saying this because I'm probably one of the =
youngest list members being only 18). Owning a porsche is a major =
resposibility and the childish response to Farzaan's post makes me =
wonder if certain people are mature enough to deal with that =
responsibility.
Oh well, I just felt something had to be said. Keep up the good work =
Farzaan, and even though I don't even have a turbo (just a turbo-nose =
:-), thanks for helping the rest of us to better understand these cars.
