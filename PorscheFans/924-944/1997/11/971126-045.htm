Agreed, especially when buying long distance.  The real question is: how
do you find someone that IS trustworthy?  I went through the PCA web site
to find someone and still got screwed by the membership chairman in the
Tennessee region, who was supposed to be one of the best mechanics in the
area.  BTW, I wonder if he got the 944 Turbo removed from his ass, =
because
that's where I told him to shove it...

>  My experience with pre-buys has been good.

I've had three other cars inspected with good success.  Well, not that I
bought any of them, but I did find out what I needed to know to NOT buy
them, which is what you really want to know.  We all WANT to buy the car
or we wouldn't be having it inspected.  So, what you want to know is why
you should NOT buy it, not why it is a good car.

>to think a pre-buy is a waste of money. =20

I would also highly recommend a pre-purchase inspection.  In my recent
screw-job I was taken, but that is not usually the case.  Actually, I
heard from my local PCar mechanic that many shops in California will NOT
do pre-purchase inspections anymore because of the liability of missing
something.  They will inspect for certain things, such as a compression
check, but they won't guarantee whether a car is good or not.  Anyone
heard the same rumor?

Cheers, and Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
