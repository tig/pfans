Regarding Chris's question, I too had a badly cracked brown dash in my last
944. In talking to a specialist parts dealer, he said that he found that the
brown ones always crack, but the black ones almost never do. It seems that
something in the brown colouring damages the integrity of the material from
which the dash is made. It started to crack when the car was just a few
years old. Very strange.

This dealer (Porscheshop, based in Birmingham, UK) had formulated a flexible
brown paint with which he could paint black dashes. They really looked very
good, but I don't know how they would stand up, long-term.

Now, here is a tip. If you are brave, you can stop a crack from propagating
for a while if you drill a small (1 or 2 mm) hole in the dash just ahead of
the crack so that the crack grows into the hole. This greatly reduces the
stress which builds up in the material at the head of the crack. The same
basic technique is used to resist formation of fatigue cracks in metal. Just
watch out and don't drill through into anything important behind the dash!
