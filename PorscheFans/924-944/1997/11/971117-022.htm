One way of mounting a smallish antenna in a non-destructive way
is next to the hatchback.  If you lift up the hatch and examine
the side rain channels near the top, you will see that there are
two holes with hex bolts in them on each side.  I've heard that
these were apparently provided for some sort of ski rack.

Bend a thin piece of moderately stiff aluminum to curve around
the hatch and drill it to match the two holes.  Once the plate
passes out of the way of the hatch, bend it to level off and drill
to match the desired antenna.  Paint the aluminum black for proper
'Euro' look.

Using a bit of cardboard to make an initial template is highly
recommended.  Note that it might take you two or three tries to
make one that you like the looks of.

I, and at least two other 944 owners I know, use a mount like this
for VHF/UHF ham antennas.  It should also work well for cell phone
antennas.  A small active antenna for the AM/FM broadcast radio,
like the one you mentioned for the Golf, should also work ok.
Though you must do something attractive with the amplifier (it
must be mounted as near the base of the antenna as possible in
order to work correctly.)
