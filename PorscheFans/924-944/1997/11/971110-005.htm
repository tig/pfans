Any information on whether the 1989 2.7 was rated any higher in Europe? 
According to the owner's manual, my USA 2.7 develops 162hp and 166
ft/lb.
of torque (10:9 compression ratio), apparently very similar to the
figures
you gave above, and I'm sure those cars are 2.5's.

Ok, I don't know about the US specs but I do know about the euro specs:

944   1983-1988  10.6:1 163hp and 205 Nm without catalytic converter
944   1985-1988  10.6:1 160hp and 205 Nm with catalytic converter
944   1989 (2.7L) 10.9:1 165hp and 225 Nm with catcon
924S 1985-1986   9.7:1  150hp and 195 Nm without cat con
924S 1987-1988  10.6:1 160hp and 205 Nm with catcon
944S 1986-1988  10.9:1 190hp and 230 Nm with catcon
944S2 1989-1991 10.9:1 211hp and 280 Nm with catcon

What can we see from these figures? The 944S (16v) clearly has more
hp but hardly any more torque (which is confirmed by this list in the
past
and by a test drive I did some time ago). The 2.7L has almost the same
hp as a 2.5 but torque is up by 10%. This means that the 2.7 has almost
the
same torque as a 2.5 16v but at much lower revs. The real solution to hp
and
torque is of course the 3.0l 16v engine (my dream car).
