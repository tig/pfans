I just recently had some brake work done (rebuilt calipers, new rotors and 
pads) on my '92 968.  I wanted to test out the brakes, so I took the car to an 
empty road and just did a few short tests of quick acceleration and then 
applying the brakes.  While the wheels did not skid, I could feel the brakes 
lock for just a second.  As well, when the brakes did lock, I felt the brake 
pedal get very hard (like when the power brakes are off and you are manually 
applying the brakes).

Does this sound normal?  Since I just bought this car, I don't really know what 
the brakes were like before I brought in the car.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.  Thanks,

Alex
