All,

I spent an hour writing and editing a four paragraph post explaining this,
and my computer crashed, so here's the short version (no cheers please).

1)  In the "banjo bolt" method of increasing boost, what part of the engine
control system sees the pressure modified by the banjo bolt?

2)  Installing a bleeder valve in the line between the cycling valve and
wastegate basically has the same effect as drilling the cycling valve (is
this statement correct?).

3)  Why not install the bleeder valve in the line to the KLR and use an
auxiliary boost gauge?  It seems to me that this would allow the KLR to
retain it's ability to drop boost to control knock under emergency situations
while tricking it into thinking the boost level is lower than it really is.
 To make this system more stable, I propose installing a check valve in the
bleeder line to isolate the bleeder valve when the system is under vacuum (so
the KLR sees the actual vacuum level) but still bleeds off the boost pressure
seen by the KLR.

4)  Finally, I'm still unsure if a chip can increase the maximum boost level
all by itself.

PS:  I have a feeling Mr. WOT will be sending me a bill after this one!
