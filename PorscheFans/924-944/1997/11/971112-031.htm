This belongs in the anecdotal section, not the technical, so those
concerned have been be warned.

I know 2/3s of the posts are about problems with 944s, but I have to
disagree that 944s are not decent daily drivers.  One of my mechanics
(who's admittedly a 911 chauvinist) gets a pained look when he has to work
on the "underpowered tractor engine" in my 944.  Doesn't like the concept
of pistons going up and down instead of side to side.  They're not that
complicated compared to all the emission garbage and variable timing
devices on other modern cars.  And let's face it, a lot of recent comments
have centered on comparisons of top-end speed.  A lot of us beat the crap
out of these cars (but baby them later, hopefully), even if we're not
racing them w/ our eyes glued to the temp and oil pressure gauges.  All
things considered, they hold up pretty well.  Hard to imagine a Honda group
having the same conversations (OK, they do drag race Hondas a lot now in S.
Calif, but those die a much quicker and more painful death from a nitrous
overdose).  If 944s were used ONLY for daily driving, they'd probably have
fewer problems.  They were designed as daily drivers; they just happen to
be great track cars.  I prefer to drive my 944 on a track because it's
safer than driving it on public roads.  Plus I hate getting those dings in
shopping mall parking lots.  

As far as maintainence costs, every try finding the equivalent of Porsche
Express, not to mention all the other Porsche parts shops, for an '88
Supra? I've been going thru this, and you end up back at the dealership
paying $60 for an intake hose. The thought of buying the entire set of
coolant hoses for this car from Toyota will really make you flinch (think
the estimate was $800-900).

This is just meant as a counterpoint.  I do believe all of it?  Well, most
of it.  The 944 electrics could be better.  Ever look inside the G10 relay?
 Looks like it was designed by Faraday back in 18 whenever. Should you have
a second car?  Everyone needs one, no matter what the first car is.

No offense, Mitch. Just didn't feel like working today and needed a diversion.
