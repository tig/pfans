Re: VRBA's comment implying that the 944 performs poorly on ice.  I
guess I have to put in my two cents worth.  I drove a 924 Turbo for
about 3 years, and a 944 for 10 years.  I know that I am gonna get a
bunch of hate mail for this, but I lovingly (half serious and half
joking) refered to these vehicles as my "winter beaters"!  I rode my
motorcycle whenever I could in the summer, so I didn't alway drive
then.  I worked full time as a ski instructor in the Rockies and visited
family in Michigan.  I found the 944 to better than most cars in the
snow AND ice!  Yes, I did put tires on the car that were meant for
winter conditions.  I found tht the 924/944's balance made the vehicle
very predictable if it were to loose traction.  It was never a surprise
and reacted in a straight-forward manner when I was trying to regain
traction.  With improper tires, ANY vehicle is lousy in ice, even 4wd! 
But with good rubber, the driver is the weakness, not the car!  Watch
the Pro Rally guys in the sonw and you'll see what I mean!

(Maybe I can really stir up a hornet's nest and start a thread on
front-wd as opposed to rear-wd....OK, I won't!)
