Howdy,

I'm not sure what is wrong with the server, but I don't think my two 
attempts at getting this For Sale post across has gone through, so I'll
do it again :)  Maybe, it could have been the 125k O2 sensor thing that
someone sent through :)

I have the following for sale, I need to clear my garage and fill my
wallet so that I can put a deposit on my new kart:

- MOMO Monte Carlo F1 steering wheel 350mm.  Excellent condition, no rips
  or anything like that, gives you a bit more leg room, a real racy steering
  wheel with HUGE grips.  US$100 including shipping.

- Pioneer DEX-M88 Competition CD Player w/ Fibre Optic cable for changer.
  Offers please.

- APE Stage II chips for Turbo S or 89+ 944T.  US$200 including K&N and
  shipping.

- Brake Cooling kit.  I bought this just a few months back from OG Racing,
  never got a chance to install it and don't need it anymore as I will be
  running karts next year so I might as well sell it now and buy another
  set later if need be.  US$200 including shipping, you save US$30 over
  retail.  This thing is BRAND NEW in the box.

- This one is a maybe, but I might have a set of forged 16x7/16x9 Turbo S
  wheels which were recently painted in a dark gray racy color (the same
  color used on the T5-R Volvo).  They are in mint condition and perfectly
  round with brand new Kuhmos on them (Kuhmos have less than 2 autocrosses).
  I'm open to offers.

- Boston Acoustics CX7 4x6 speaker for front doors, brand new.  Bought
  for C$100, will sell for US$65.  I'd prefer to sell this one locally
  because shipping may make up a significant chunk of the $65.

All of the above, I'm open to offers, I just want to move this stuff as
I need to put a deposit on a chassis for the next season before they get
sold out.

Farzaan,
