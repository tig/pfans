Even the NA 924 has a Porsche head, an aluminium one mated to an iron Audi
block. I was under the impression that the GTRs also used the Audi blocks.
If not, what kind of block did they have? Like I said, the Auto Atlanta
catalog says the 375hp GTR had an Audi engine, which is to say _block_. Are
you saying this is false?

I am aware of all of this. But what kind of block did it have, if not an
Audi one?
