Paul,
I solved this problem in my '86 951 by adding an exteinsion to my accelorator
(sp) pedal.  I took the pedal out (two screws in the floorboard, and clip on
linkage).  Manufactured a new pedal surface the length of the gas pedal, and
the width of the gas pedal plus the amount I wanted to extend it towards the
brake pedal (I think I did about 1/2 inch.)  You can use any material.  I had
a piece of some shingle material or something.  It was a little less than 1/4
inch thick, and was some waxy, platic material.  Still not sure exactly what
it is!.  Anyway, I held the new surface on the bedal, and drilled some holes
for pop rivets.  riveted them together and re-installed.  What that gives me
is a gas pedal that's 1/2 inch closer to my brake.  VERY easy to roll my foot
to the right slightly to blip the gas.  So easy, I do it almost all the time
during daily driving.  SO easy, when I first installed it, I almost drove
through a stop sign and off the road because I hit the brakes hard, and
unknowingly grabbed some throttle to!!!!  
Works great though.
