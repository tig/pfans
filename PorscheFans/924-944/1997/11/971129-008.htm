Morning P-folks,

This morning was my turn to get the rear end out. Down the road about a
mile from the house is a curve in the road. At the bottom of a small hill
this narrow country road curves left at about an 80 degree turn then you
climb the other side of the hill. I travel this way every day to work so
I'm very familiar. The road is not good...rough blacktop interspersed with
slick patches of asphalt from repairs. On my old tires the rear would let
go at almost any speed in this curve when dry but my new tires hang on. So
I've had experience with the rear getting out on me, however, under
control. Today was somewhat different...It was rainy, I was going a bit
fast for the conditions. When dry usually take this curve at about 40,
coming down the hill in 4th , foot off the gas. 4th is too high a gear but
it keeps me from trying to get cute in this curve. I enter the curve
slightly across the middle...oh, sh*t...just as I enter a truck enters on
the other side. I make a quick but smooth right hand steering correction.
At the same time I must have lifted slightly off the gas(I was on the gas
at this point being at the bottom of the hill). Thats when I felt the rear
letting go. I'm gently sliding sideways right at this point. It must have
been instinct because I got back on the gas gently, the rear tires regained
traction and the car made a smoooth recovery. The Comp T/As performed
beautifully. I never panicked but we(me and the car) could have easily
ended up in some fine fellows ditch.

Y'all have a good day.
