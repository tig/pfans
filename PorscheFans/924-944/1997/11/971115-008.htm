Now wait, let me get this straight. You now own a 951S and you are
recommending a car w/ a normally aspirated engine as the better choice?  If
my memory still serves me, this is a first time that a PFan turbo owner has
faltered and been swayed in this direction.  What's going on here? One of
the absolutes in life has crumbled. I hope this conversion is based solely
on consideration of class competition, and hints at nothing deeper.

BTW, what are the shift speeds in the 968? I know the 6th gear has been
termed an "economy" gear. Think the lower gears would offer that much of an
advantage on the track?

1989 S2, perhaps waiting for a 968 engine --  or a 951 head, chip and turbo.
