I got to thinking (never a good thing) and now I have these questions:

here's some stuff I do a lot, are they harmful?

1. at stop lights, I tend to keep the clutch pedal depressed... would it be
better to leave the clutch out, and engage it when it's time to go? or does
it not matter?

2. never on flat or slight inclines, but if I'm pointed down a hill of any
sort, I will go with a second gear start, I really enjoy the legs of 2nd
gear as opposed to the stump puller 1st gear... the downhill aspect seems
important as the car does not bog... this does not feel good on flat or
slight inclines, so I only do it if the car is pointed down any kind of
hill...

am I a clutch killer?

________________

and for answering my questions, I toss out a tip:

if you are a windows up and play music all the time kind of person, I
suggest, rolling the windows down and turning the radio off so you can hear
the car... do this every couple of weeks or so, and be assured that you
catch any funky sounds early... with the windows up and the radio on, you
really can't hear the engine at all, so belt whine, clatter, chatter, new
and exciting harmonics, and metallic rebellion will go unoticed until the
big hiccup...

thanks later...
