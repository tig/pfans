The apprentice sits at the master's feet.  "Master, I am troubled by a
great mystery." =


The master reflects for a moment then says, "Ah yes, the meaning of life,=

it is difficult to comprehend".  =


Apprentice:  "No I understand the meaning of life, I need help replacing
the clutch in my S2".

Master:  "Ahhhh, the journey that has no end."

Apprentice:  "No end?  The flat rate book says 15 hours for R & R.

Master:  "The road to inner contentment and happiness does not run throug=
h
the flat rate book."

Apprentice:  "Yet the master has a flat rate book in his shop."

Master:  "It is for emergencies when I run out of toilet paper.  Remember=

as one mystery is solved, another may appear."

Apprentice:  The only mystery I am concerned with is lack of seat time. =

I'll take the chance."

Master:  "Put on this hair shirt.  The suffering will prepare you for the=

clutch." =


Apprentice:  "I been wearing a 951 hair shirt for over a year, isn't that=

enough suffering?"

Master:  "Yes, enough suffering, put the car on the rack."

My engine builder declares that this is a two man job, rattles off a list=

of steps and disappears to tend to his other projects.  He reappears when=

two people are required or when I get stuck.  The day ends with the
transaxle and entire rear suspension out and the clutch laying on the
floor.  The pressure plate side of the friction disc had disintegrate int=
o
three large chunks.  The rubber center looks like new.  He examines the
flywheel and states that this is the second clutch.  He points out some
non-factory sanding scratches on the flywheel obviously not made by Porsc=
he
elves.  He starts mumbling about the construction of the replacement disc=
=2E =

I point out this is the latest updated Sachs disc with a spring center,
even in a genuine Sachs box.  He continues mumbling.  This is a warning
sign, lights should be flashing, sirens blaring, a prudent person would
pick up their tool box and run for the door.  No, I stand there like a fo=
ol
waiting for the first session of Clutch Redesign 101 to begin.

A week later, I graduate from CR 101 with a sintered bronze paddle wheel
disc installed.  As I turn the ignition key at my commencement, my builde=
r
and the local rice burner builder are in attendance.  The car will not
start and dumps fuel on the shop floor.  It seems that the graduate forgo=
t
to tighten one of the fuel filter fittings.  Back up on the lift, a quick=

tighten, several comments from the peanut gallery and the car starts.  I
back out and take it for a spin.  To my surprise, it works, a bit grabby
but it works.  =


In addition to learning more about clutches than most humans would ever
want to know, I was exposed to the ponderous CV joints (no you don't smok=
e
them).  Tech tip:  Do not disassemble one of these buggers unless you mar=
k
the cage and inner and outer race.  For those of you with nothing to do o=
n
these long winter nights, try to put a CV joint back together.  The fun
never ends.

The clutch works and the telltale click has disappeared with a little joi=
nt
reversal.  Now if I can just get my turbo back together the 12th level of=

happiness would be mine.
