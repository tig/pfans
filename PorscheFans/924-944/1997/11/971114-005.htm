Hi from a complete Porsche newbie...

How accurate and useful would you technical experts expect a Porsche dealer's
check to be -- when purchasing an older car with a patchy service history? Is
the Porsche pre-purchase check worth anything or is it a brand-name
extravagance? 

I'm feeling slightly bruised. Back in August I was considering the purchase of
an '84 924  and commissioned the local Porsche dealer to give the car a
pre-purchase check (cost 110 pounds UK). This was to be my first Porsche.

The Porsche report did not note any major problems: the worst being some
difficulty in cold-starting (the engine sometimes misfiring). I was told
verbally that there was nothing seriously wrong, the car was in good condition
and a 12k service, plus other bits and pieces "would see the car right" -- and
my costs would come to 1k pounds "at the outside". I decided to buy the 924...
and didn't haggle too seriously as it was a "good" example...

Big mistake. The car has (apparently) required major technical work and the
same Porsche experts have already relieved me of nearly 2,000 UK pounds before
I have even managed 500 miles in the 924. The jobs have included a new rear
brake system, cylinder head replaning, new valve guides and one valve
replacement. And the car is once again off the road because of unreliable
starting (electrics are being blamed this time) it smells strongly of
gasoline, has soft brakes.... the prospects are not good. 


Looking at the Porsche report and the subsequent work that has been carried
out  I notice that  
1. Some of the "problems" seem to have mended themselves by magic (e.g. rear
bearings, rear wiper). In the case of the faulty rear wiper, the magic
consisted of finding the on-switch!!!

2. Some problems seem to have required much more work than was initially
diagnosed (e.g. much of the rear braking system including pads was replaced,
not just corroded pipes)

3. Other major faults (90% loss of compression on No.1 cylinder) were not detected.

What do the technical folk on this list think? Are these reports worth the
paper that they are written on...? I've been seriously disenchanted by this
experience of Porsche quality. I know the 924 is hardly "top of the range" but
if dealers' standards are sloppy with older/cheaper models it does not promise
much for their ability to deal with the upper end of the market.

My project buy-a-911 is now indefinitely shelved!!


Thanks for your help
