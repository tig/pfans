It seems that fan and cooling troubles continue for me but near their end=
..  I
have traced my problem to a faulty fan relay.  Sometimes it works, other
times it does not.  Mine is an =9283 so I was in for what I thought wa a
pleasant surprise.  The fan relay was only $9.00 from the dealer.  the
=9185-=9286 relay is $80.00  But, as it turns out, nothing is easy.  I gl=
adly
left the dealer having spent only $9.00 to fix my problem.  But when I go=
t
home, my car has the =9185-=9286 relay in it!  And, there is an additiona=
l
connection in the newer relay that connects to a wire that DOES exist in =
my
relay receptacle!

How can this be?  My car was made in May of 1983.  I know Porsche was big=
 on
implementing changes as they were manufactured but we=92re talking May of=
 1983
that the parts books list going to 1985 models!

The part number I was given runs from =9283 to =9285 (early) and is numbe=
r
141.951.253B

The part in my car that is for late =9185-=9286 is 944.615.104.01

Anyone have any ideas?  The later relay has a connection labeled for port
number 4 that the early one does NOT.  Since my receptacle has a wire por=
t 4
I am loath to use the early relay, But I also don=92t want to spend anoth=
er
$70.00 if I don=92t have to.  Other than number 4, both relays connect to=
 ports
numbered 85, 86 and 87.

Any ideas would be welcomed at this end.
