I read Mike Mitchell's post regarding his fuel line leak with great
interest. A few years ago, I read (and printed) a recall campaign notice
regarding 944 fuel lines that could leak and cause an engine compartment
fire. Found this in a Mitchell On-Demand Repair & Estimating CD down at
my local garage.

The production date of my first 944 (a late '85) matched the recall
info, so I called the local dealer (Carlson Porsche in Palo Alto, CA).
They asked me the VIN number, which I gave to them. Bingo. "Come in to
have it repaired" they said. "Free of charge, of course?" I asked. "Of
course" the service advisor replied.

Knowing they must fix safety-related recall stuff in front of regular
customer appointments, I insisted on a next day appointment, 8am...and
they agreed. I was outta there in an hour with a new fuel line. If I
still have the recall notice, I'll post it to my 944 page
(http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/1760) and notify the list of the
URL.
