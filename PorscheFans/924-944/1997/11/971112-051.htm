After several weeks in the shop, I now have my first Porsche on the
street. Three days of driving, and not one of them dry...

The speedometer/odometer is non-responsive. Cable shows no outward signs
of abuse, assuming I've correctly identified it - I've gotten behind the
instrument cluster looking for anything obvious. Everything was fine, but
I think created a new 1/8" gap between the steering wheel and the column
switches :-}  Cable looks okay from under the hood, seems to be connected
to something on the front driver's wheel assembly. Any suggestions? Tips
on where to get a new replacement speedo/cable would be appreciated.

The heat is also constantly on. This is fine for the winter, but by
spring I'll want to have this cleared up ;-)  The blower fan works fine,
but the temperature control doesn't have any effect. I started to remove
the center console, but that looks like a full-day project -- my mechanic
described it as "kindof medieval behind there." What can I look for in
the engine compartment?

Any help appreciated. I'm dying to know how fast I'm going when fifth
gear finally sounds like its doing some work!

--Steve.
