Hello P-Fans
	I too last year noticed that the return fuel line leaking on my '86 951. And
yes - I too found out that Porsche will sell you a metal fuel line - about
four feet long with a rubber hose crimped on. The "new" hose cost around
$112. 
	Porsche also makes a repair kit that some dealers are not aware of:
part#951-356-987-00  $16. The repair kits consists of a ruber hose and two
hose clamps. 
	What I did was to cut off the old fuel line from where it is crimped onto
the metal line - that comes out of the right fender. The rubber fuel line has
a crimped fitting where it attatches to the metal line - I simply used a pair
of "dikes" or "wire cutters". Carefully cut away the crimped fitting - you
are then left with a steel line coming out of the fender. Install your new
rubber hose & clamps. 
	One other tip - I do not like the screw type clamps used on the fuel lines.
These screw clamps will leak when the weather gets cold - and they seem to
losen up with age. I use a spring loaded clamp that VW/Audi (simular to the
coolant hose clamps VW-Audi use also) use on all their fuel line recalls. I
do not have a part number but if you look at any VW VR6 motor fuel lines (at
the fuel rail) you will see these spring loaded clamps. Most VW dealers stock
these clamps as part of the recall program. They sell for $2 each. 
					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
