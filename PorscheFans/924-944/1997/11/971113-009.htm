OK John, I was dumping a little ;).  Since purchasing my '87 NA 944 I have
had to replace the air conditioning compressor ($$$) and now the drive
dampener just failed ($$$).  Also, the sun roof motors have failed, and
several other switches are "unhappy".  All in all, I love the car but
repairs are over $3K already (after 1 seasons use).

Just to defend my mechanic for those readers in the central Ohio area, Csaba
Tatrai is probably the top Porsche mechanic in town.  He does have an
"interesting" sense of humor however....
