I do not believe that State Farm can direct business in the manner in which
they are doing by telling you where you must have your glass installed.  They
were sued over this a few years back and lost in a big way.  They were sued by
car owners, glass repair shops and glass material repair suppliers.  State Farm
"approved glass repair shops" were having to cheat on the installations to make
any kind of profit and the jobs were judged unsatisfactory and unsafe.

They can STRONGLY suggest where to go and that you have to use generic glass
but cannot make you do so.  To direct you towards certain businesses is
illegal.  Not all glass is the same.  Glass is engineered into the cars
structural integrity for airbag deployment and rollover protection.  To
compromise on these specifications to save money is a mistake.

Someone please let me know if this is the case.  I can do some further checking
on my end and get back to the list.  Ask your State Farm rep about this lawsuit
and see what he/she says.  Then ask your state insurance board the same
questions, I'm willing to bet the answers will not be the asme.
