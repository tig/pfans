I'm changing my head gasket and notice that the balance shaft belt is
very loose.  Having just paid to have the belts done a couple months ago
I naturally questioned the mechanic and service manager at the Porsche
dealer when I was there for parts.  They said "If you tighten that belt
as tight as spec they make a hell of a lot of noise, like a jet engine
or something, we just make them tight enough to be sure they don't jump
time and leave it at that."  I just nodded and said ok, but having heard
much about the turbine sound here on the list I thought I'd share that
little piece of questionable Porsche wisdom.
