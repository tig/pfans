it is definitely on my list of things to do...

those two incidents were over a year ago, and nothing similar (or even
close) has happened since... this is my first rear wheel drive car, so I
figured I'd have to do some learning... before this I have only had front
wheel drive cars and motorcycles... front wheel drive cars are easy to
drive, and motorcycles make you pay full attention and had I goofed, I
probably would not be here...

obviously I don't want to harm anybody or act like a total jackass on
public streets... mostly I brought those incidents up to show that, while
the car usually feels very planted and controlled, it does have its
characteristics and they can be quite severe if abused...

the sliding around a wet parking lot thing is amateur, but it served the
purpose of getting safe seat time on (and beyond) the limits until I can
get a car to go autocrossing with...
