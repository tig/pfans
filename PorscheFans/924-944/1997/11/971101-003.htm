Hi Mike,

I dont have an S2, rather I have a 1988 944S. I did however take the advice
of several people and several advertisements just last week and bought an
Autothority Performance Chip. After using it for 2 days, I am returning it.
It did give a small bit of noticable horsepower gain, between 5500 and 7000
rpm. The literature says that a realistic gain of 15-18 horse is usual. I
would agree. BUT.... what changed on my car between 1500 and 5000 rpm is
what is making me return the chip. Almost no throttle reponse like it did
with the stock chip. The stock chip allowed the engine to rev to approx
7000, had great throttle response and a good pull all the way to redline.
With the APE chip, the car feels like a turbo. Big lag, mushy throttle until
5000 and then bam the power comes on hard. A powerband between 5500 and 7000
is not real usable for everyday driving. I can honestly say that I can drive
my car faster and quicker with the stock chip due to quicker midrage
acceleration. Try the APE S2 chip out... but dont expect CV joint twisting
power out of the hole as promised. It just wasn't the case. Just thought you
would like some real world experience advice.
