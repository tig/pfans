Ok, I leave for one week to tear my car apart and people lose their
cool.  Farzaan, you constantly amaze me and others with your knowledge
of turbo's, racing etc.  Keep writing in, and don't hold any opinions
back.  Sometimes you won't be correct, and I hope someone points it out
at the time.  If people on this list don't understand that an opinion
posted is an opinion that can be ignored then these people need to drink
less coffee, take more valium and buy a damn American minivan.  Track
times are often not directly related to street performance, but they
certainly do have relevance in the 'real world' even if some people
think not.  Horsepower is horsepower whether at the track or at a stop
light.  Your 'bandwith wasting drivel' was perfectly understood by most
of us with any mechanical background and the rest should ignore it or
learn from it.  Like I said, maybe you're not always correct, but you
are always trying and that is the mark of an enthusiast.  You're a
youngster, so you'll be wrong on occasion, but if I knew at your age
what I know today......   :)  (a JOKE alright...everyone put the guns
down)
