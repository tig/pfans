Hi Michael;

Welcome to the club of "Oil Cooler Seal" specialists..  Did mine a couple of
weeks ago, and hopefully this message will provide as much inspiration as
technical tips/advice :-)  Anyway, here goes.....

Block out about 4 hours of time - and don't let any impressionable children
around as the cuss words will spew forth at several points in the
disassembly...

1: Remove the bottom engine cover (about a bazillion 10mm bolts and other
fasteners..)

2: Remove the oil filter

3: Drain the coolant from the block

4: Loosen the exhaust flange from the exhaust manifold and the exhaust
manifold from the head (don't ask, I'll explain later)...

5: Remove the wires from the oil pressure sending unit attached to the
housing (2 wires - label them for each of the posts to help with reassembly)

6: Remove the oil hose(s) from the housing (if you have an external oil
cooler)

7: Remove the heat shields that are at the top/sides of the cooler housing
(You don't have to take 2 of them out, just push them out of the way.  (If
you do take them out, remember how they were located - I had a heck of a
time figuring out how they went back - sort of like a metal jigsaw puzzle.)

8: Remove the oil pressure regulator plunger from the side of the housing
(be careful, on your year/model, it is spring loaded if it hasn't been
modified to the newer type)

9:  Now for the fun part.  There are 3 housing retaining bolts - two are a
snap to get to.  You guessed it, the one at the top (just under the exhaust
manifold) is a bear to get a good grip on. I got to it by pulling the
exhaust manifold about 1/2" away from the head and sneaking a 13mm wrench
onto it.  Once it was loose, used an assortment of extensions and elbows for
a 1/4" socket wrench.  That one bolt took me about 15 minutes to get out
alone.

10: Remove the housing (easier to get at from under the car)

11:  Replace the $3 seals which have now taken about 2 hours to get to
(nope, I don't get it either - you'd think either the seals should be more
expensive to justify all the work, or the housing would be easier to get
to...)

12: Reassemble everything pretty much in reverse order..... But be careful
to seat the new metal/rubber lipped gasket properly and that it stays seated
while reinstalling the housing.

While I might have forgotten a couple of things, I think that the steps are
pretty much it.  I also, removed the belt to the PS pump, but I wasn't sure
it really helped or not...

Hope this helps.

Good Luck
