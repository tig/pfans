Bob,

	I had been using Mobil 1 (the Red stuff), and my buddies who
work for them said that it was a mistake. CV grease needs to be runny &
clingy with long molique sulfur (to take the pressure). The Red stuff is
too heavy and unless you just pack the boot full it spins off the joint.

	Any way we went round and round on the subject till they drug in
an engineer who after we talked said "Go get real CV grease, we make it
but only sell it in 50 gal drums". So I did, but I fold a supply house
that would that had small size (5 gal).

I am cleaning out mine and starting over, they are just to easy to do.

Dan

PS: on a 951 you can cross the whole unit from side to side and extend
the life

 (wheel)  O----#1-------I  (Tranny)  I -------#2 -------O  (wheel)

			To

 (wheel)  I-----#2-------O (Tranny) O------#1--------I (Wheel)

This reverses the load sid of the race, so if the bearing is worn down
you only have the worn side in reverse
