Ben: your '86 951 is at least 20 horses short of a 968, not to mention
thousands of miles older, minus the variable cam, and about 50 ft lbs of
torque less endowed. Comparing it with an '84 or later 911 would make
the differences even more painfully obvious. In fact at 216HP when new,
your car is much closer in power/weight and torque/weight
characteristics to the 944 NA and the S2 (208HP) that you call "the less
powerful 944 variants," than the 968 or the '88/'89 951S.

Don't get me wrong, my '84 NA can still beat inept drivers with C5s and
Supras on occasion, especially between the cones and in the twisties,
but all other things being equal let's not be unrealistic about the
944's power, or the lack of it. Off the line, every 944 and 951 I have
ever driven wants to enjoy the scenery and relax, until the 3k-4.5k RPM
range when they decide to behave like an F50!
