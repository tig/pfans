After years of asking the experts about appropriate ride height for the 951
which sees street, AX and track duty, I finally found someone who feels he
has a definitive answer.  Please note that within a range of reasonable
assumptions about car set-up, level of preparation, weight, et cetera, that
almost everyone aligns these cars to roughly the same general specs.  Of
course, these assumptions also include the range of DOT-approved tires: A008,
BFG Comp T/A R1, Hoosier and Goodyear GSCS.

Anyway, Jeff Stone (KMR) has shared the following specs:

Front: measure from the bottom of the bolt head at the rear control arm
mounting bracket (i.e., caster block) to the ground.  130 + or - 5 mm
(factory arms), or + or - 10mm (Fabcar arms).

Rear: measure from the center of the torsion bar tube.  230 + or - 5 or 10
mm, depending on the front.

Of course, as Jim Pasha points out, you want the car as level as possible.  I
believe that these are good specs, as they come from Jeff who has a
tremendous amount of experience setting up race  and street/race cars at
Kelly-Moss.

By the way, watch those caster blocks.  The ones in my '87 951 car (actually
Turbo S units with 33,000 miles) had broken down rubber and allowed the
castor to change dynamically.  They were replaced last year with an updated
factory part-- made a difference in handling.  The updated part seems to have
a more robust design.
