I've a 1990 944 s2, great car when it starts, expensive garage ornament
when it doesn't. I'm sure that most of you have had this feeling at some
time or other!

The starting has been getting worse on an on going basis, it will either
start straight away or not at all, leaving it alone to sulk for a while
used to help, but no luck this time.

I've got a healthy spark, so I suspect that that it's a fuel problem,
I've checked all the fuses and relays in the fuse box, but are there any
more fuses / relays elsewhere? Is there a fuel pump relay? If so where?
Where is the fuel pump?

I hope to go and watch the World Rally Championship tomorrow and if the
Porsche won't go I'll have to take my company car (a Vauxhall Vectra) a
fate possibly worse than death!

Thanks in advance.
