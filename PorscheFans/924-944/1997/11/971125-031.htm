Dear PFANS:

85 944 90K

After a long highway trip(3000K) I noticed a whirling sound coming from the
rear. It is not quite a click, more like a whirl.=A0 It is quite pronounced
while decelerating, when the throttle is lifted you can really hear it, back
on the throttle it just about goes away.=A0 It almost sounds like the=
 exhaust
sound that=20
reverberates off a close wall or structure while accelerating, but not=
 quite.

Others have suggested the CV Joints, does this sound about right?=A0

Since the CV joints are original anyway, I plan on repacking them and
switching them this weekend after Turkey Day. ( I will be in rural Idaho,
how long can you watch satellite TV and play Nintendo64?)

Are there any general extra tips to the process.=A0 I have read the FAQ and
checked the manual and it all seems straightforward.=A0 But that was how the
Motor Mounts seemed, so I figure there are a few "hints."=A0 What exactly is
the correct swapping setup -=A0 same side, same axle rotation, opposite cv
rotation? Any help is appreciated.

In addition, I have a Power Steering Fluid Reservoir O-ring (92834792700)
and it is yours for the asking, the first who needs it and sends their
address will get it mailed out.

Thanks In Adavance
