Hello Everyone,

Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Jim Dresser, and my =
wife just bought a 1988 944 Turbo S.  50,000 miles, ruby-champagne =
color, and in great condition (except for the drivers seat).  We've been =
very active in the local BMW club for over 10 years, and (of course), we =
just joined the Porsche Club.  Our main 'sport' with these cars has been =
drivers schools, with our home track being Watkins Glen, and we've been =
to Mid-Ohio, Mosport, Lime Rock......    I do most car maintenance =
myself.

Being new to Porsche's, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience =
with 944 Turbo's at Drivers Schools.  What are common failure modes, =
suggested rim sizes (to hold the new BFG R1's), is synthetic oil =
recommended in the engine? transmission? differential?  Best engine =
Chip? .........   I'm currently going through the archives, but so far =
I've only gone back to October.  There's alot of info there.

I know that I'll have lots of questions in the upcoming years, so I'd =
like to thank everyone ahead of time.   And as soon as I hear when the =
drivers schools at Watkins Glen for '98 are, I'll post it.  Thanks =
again.  Jim
