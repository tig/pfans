  Hey P-fans,
 First, thanks to every one who responded to my swaybar request.  I have just
replaced my  power steering rack (reconditioned from Vertex $269), front
stuts (boges from Paragon Products), and one tierod plus boots (from my local
Porsche dealer, Momentum Porsche $75 +$5.50x2) Since Momentum provided the
wrong sized copper compression bushings for the p.s. lines, I got them from
our other P-dealer, Don McGill who courtiously mailed me them, even though
the order was more trouble for them than it was worth! 
My question for the tire gurus out there... MY front tires, 215 60x15 Pirelli
4000s show some wear from the bad front end, and I'm thinking of moving the
rear tires  to the front and putting 225 50x15s on the back.  Will they
fit/clear okay? How will this affect the handling, especially since I'm also
going from no rear sway bar to one provided through the list? Is bigger
always better in a sway bar? This car is driven exclusively on the street.
And yes I know the  Pirelli tires were not the best choice for handling! Also
my Fuch  rims are different offset front & rear... Does this mean I have the
wheels listed below or do the 7 J x 15 H2 differ front and rear? I,m too lazy
to pull the tire off and measure!
TIA
