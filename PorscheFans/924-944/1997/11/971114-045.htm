Hi from a complete Porsche newbie...

>How accurate and useful would you technical experts expect a Porsche dealer's
>check to be..

Sorry to say, Roz, only as good as the mechanic behind it.  For example,
I used to do all my own maintenance on my 924 Turbo - but, I took it in
to a local P Dealer to set the air/fuel mix (I didn't have the
equipment)  In the end, I had to show the mechanic how to adjust it -
both the equipment and the air/fuel.  I'm still scratching my head over
that one.

From the rest of your post, sounds like you've not had a great
experience with the dealership rather then the the car itself.  If it
had been fixed as promised, in both work and price, you probably
wouldn't have had to post all of the unresolved issues.

Anyway, you have two courses you might consider. I am sure that Porsche
Cars GB would be interested in a copy of your pre-tech inspection report
and copies of actual work performed at that dealership in the last three
months. In the meantime, find a capable mechanic - one who explains
problems in terms that are understandable to you.  I have heard very
positive things about Autofarm and are located in Oxon - not terribly
far from Cambridge, if my memory serves me right.

More specifically, yes the pre-tech should have caught the compression
loss and other obvious items like brake pads, etc.  However, if you were
told that the rear bearing were gone, and that problem has since
"magically" disappeared - I would really question the accuracy of the
entire pre-tech.  Mechanical problem like bearings, just don't disappear
(electrical problems, well, maybe...:-)

>I know the 924 is hardly "top of the
>range" but if dealers' standards are sloppy 

You don't have to make any excuses for an '84 924. It's as much a
Porsche, well, as any Porsche.

>My project buy-a-911 is now indefinitely shelved!!

Wanna bet?  I got hooked into Porsches by that 924 Turbo a lot of years
ago. Have owned 14 since then and still have three.  You will understand
that these aren't cars, they are legalized addictions.  Just look at the
activity on this list during business days when most of us are supposed
to be chained to our desk accomplishing "real work"... <Big Grin>
