Use some gentle heat from a hair dryer to soften the adhesive as you slowly
peel.  Don't use any sharp scraping tools.  Clean up the residue with a
soft rag and 3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner.  This cleaner will strip
all adhesive residue and wax from the area.  Re-application should be
straight forward.  Be sure to avoid trapping air bubbles under the new
adhesive.  Remember to re-wax the area when finished.

If the blemish is indeed only a mark and not a true scratch, it can almost
definitely be reomoved.  Use some Meguiar's #2 Fine Cut Cleaner and a terry
cloth to hand rub the mark.  Be very careful not to go through the clear
coat.  This polish has an abrasive to cut through the mark, but it is mild
enough that it won't strip layers of paint too quickly.  Work the area
several times until the mark thins away by always using a new section of
towel.  Be very cautious about using a Medium or High cut cleaner unless
you are confident in your abilities.  Likewise, don't use a power polisher
unless you are experienced and know how to avoid burns.  Once the mark is
gone, lightly polish the area with Meguiar's #9 Swirl Remover to restore
the shine and replace the oils lost in rubbing.  Lastly, re-wax.

<snip>

I'm guessing that what you think is "chrome" is actually an anodized finish
on the alloy.  Unless you know for sure that the wheels were chromed in the
past, you are probably experiencing pitting and blemishes on the anodized
coating.  Brake dust, road salt, and other contaminants take a nasty toll
on alloy wheels over time.  If they are in really bad shape your wheels
will most likely require professional refinishing.  To remove the weight
tape use the 3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner again.  Then, use a very
small amount of Blue Magic Metal Polish on a soft rag to shine the silver
wheel rims.  This will remove minor problems, but major etching or pits
will require refinishing.  Remember to wax the entire wheel when you are
done.  A frequent coat of wax is your best early defense against the nasty
corrosive elements.

Good Luck!
