In a message dated 97-11-10 14:07:55 EST, you write:

<< Ben: your '86 951 is at least 20 horses short of a 968, not to mention
>thousands of miles older, minus the variable cam, and about 50 ft lbs
of >>

I figured someone would have said something about this, but the 968 does not
have a variable cam, it has a variable intake runner system called
"vario-ram"

Dear BadBob & P-Fans
	The 968 DOES NOT have "Vario-Ram" system like that of the '96 & up 993
models. The 968 DOES HAVE "Vario-Cam" - if you do not believe me look at Pano
- Up-Fixin' Vol IX, page 15.  There are no moving parts of this "Dual Inlet
Path System". The 993 "Vario-Ram" system does have moveable parts - change
the path the air must flow to the cylinder head - and - effecting the air
flow characteristics. 
	The 968 does have a "Dual Inlet Path System" which I think you have confused
with "Vario-Ram" system. A "Dual Inlet Path System"- where intake air enters
the manifold from the front as well as by a divider and bypass tube from the
back/rear of the manifold. This in-effect gives a "harmonic pressure
pulsations" - a sort of super charging effect base on the speed as which the
piston pumps/move air flow. On the 968 the speed in which this comes into
plat is in the 4000-6400 RPM range. The one draw back of the split manifold
is a loos of power in the mid-range, which is more than offset by the "Vario-C
am" feature the 968 employs.

PS: If you like reading about techno-stuff. I highly reccmend the PANO -
Up-Fixin' Series. Especially the Vol VII, covering the 951.
Where else can you read what Porsche actually thought up when dessigning our
wonderfull cars!
