This post has absolutely no redeeming factor other than satisfying my urge 
to chime in on the subject of Porsches as daily drivers.

The first time my Dodge Daytona stranded me, I sold it to my friend for a 
1/4 of its worth and bought a Porsche.

The first time my Porsche stranded me, I called the towing service and 
discussed how we were going to get it on a flatbed without doing any 
damage:-)

When my fiance's VW started stranding her, and sending me out doing 
late night highway patch jobs, we gave it away and bought her a brand 
new 1996 Acura.  Personally, I'm not very fond of it but I know she'll get 
where she's going. (can't get VTEC w/ auto trans, ugh!)

Different strokes, different folks.  Also, I know my Porsche is going to 
spend at least a couple days a year in the shop for std maintenance so an 
extra vehicle (motorcycle for me) is almost mandatory.

If you want a reliable daily driver, I would think twice about a Porsche.  
They CAN be, and ARE, but it seems to take some care and forward 
thinking.

As a measuring point, my 88 951 has 80k miles and is on at least its 3rd 
timing belt.  How many Honda owners can say that?  Arguably, how 
many car owners WANT to say that :-)

One thing I can say is, EVERY SINGLE TIME I drive my car, I enjoy it. I 
enjoy the whole experience.  And it's not just a speed thing.  My FJ1100 
blows the door off my 951 any time, anywhere (under 140mph).   And I 
can carry just as many passengers.  Then again, my friend's YZF blows 
the wheels off my FJ most of the time and I still wouldn't swap.  It's a 
matter of what fits your personality.

When I get real old and slow, I'll probably get one of those Ferrari's that 
has 6 zillion lb-ft of torque at 1200 rpm.  Then I'll just drive around in 3rd 
gear all the time :-)
