Howdy guys,

BadBob951 asked some questions over the weekend.  I don't have that email
here with me at work, but I will try to answer the questions the best I
can from memory.  The method I'll use is, rather than give specific 
examples of this car, I will go through the steps in how the car controls
boost from the most simplistic terms to the more complex way the 944T
controls the boost.

Since I am relatively new at this car, I might make a mistake, so please
correct me if I'm wrong, some things you just have to assume because I
did not work at the factory when this car was built :)

All boost is given in bar and atmosphere should be assumed to be 1 bar.

The first thing to do when trying to understand a system in a mechanical
thing is to bring it down to the most basic level of technology.  In the
944T, the boost control mechanism, the mechanical boost controller is the
wastegate.  If you removed EVERY electronic gizmo between the wastegate
and a feed off the intake (in our car, the banjo bolt on the intercooler
piping after the turbo), your car would make 0.2bar boost.  So, from
a purely mechanical point of view, when the wastegate senses that there is
0.2bar pressure on the diaphragm, it will force the wastegate to open and
vent the excess exhaust presssure this keeping the boost pressure at 0.2bar.
When your car is not operating correctly, you will notice that it is limited
to 0.2bar boost, this is because all of the electronic gizmos in between
the intake manifold and the wastegate shut down and allow all of the pressure
signal to reach the wastegate.

Now, there are various ways to increase the boost on a purely mechanical
setup:
1. Install a heavier spring rate in the wastegate diaphragm to allow the
   wastegate to open later with more pressure needed.  On the 911T, many
   people use 1.0bar boost springs to get higher boost pressure.  On the
   944T, the factory used a very soft spring allowing only 0.2bar of boost;
   I don't know if you can even get a harder spring, but as you will see
   later, it doesn't make much sense to do that.  Harder springs in the
   wastegate usually give better boost response, but they make the car
   come on full charge more abruptly, more like an on/off switch.
2. Install a bleeder valve between the intake pressure feed and the wastegate.
   This bleeder valve is usually as simple as an aquirium fitting with a 
   screw in it.  You bleed the pressure signal to atmosphere.  All that this
   does is trick the wastegate into seeing a lower pressure signal.  Since
   it sees only a portion of the real pressure in the intake, it will open
   at a higher boost pressure.  Problems with this system are usually caused
   by environment changes such as temperature and humidity.  There are now
   very sophisticated bleeder valves available with check valves and dual
   pressure gizmos, etc. that will allow a $90 bleeder to operate in the same
   manner as a much more expensive electronic model.  The only company I know
   of that manufacturers these units is http://www.buschurracing.com  They
   have a customer names Marc Hallman that designed the system and it is now
   called the Marc Hallman boost controller.  I've noticed that many companies
   have copied the design, but none work as well as the original.  The MH
   boost controller is used on 7 of the top 10 fastest Talons in the World,
   including Tym Switzer's record setting 10.9 @ 125mph car.

   Just to give you a mathematical understanding of how the bleeder works,
   I will simplify it:

   Full pressure from intake manifold (0.2bar) reaches wastegate = 0.2bar
   boost pressure.  Calc: 0.2 - 0.0bar = 0.2bar of boost.

   Full pressure from intake manifold (0.8bar) reaches bleeder valve which
   then bleeds 0.6bar to allow the wastegate to see 0.2bar.  
   Calc: 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.2bar of boost.

   So, you can see from those calculations that in the first case, the
   full signal is sent to the wastegate, in the second, 0.6 bar is bled
   off the pressure line and the wastegate will not open until the boost
   pressure reaches 0.8bar.  This is difficult to explain through text,
   but you get the picture, from a purely mechanical point of view, the
   wastegate is seeing the same 0.2bar pressure, even though the intake
   manifold is now seeing 0.8bar instead of 0.2bar.

Ok, now that we know how the mechanical aspect of the system works, stay
tuned for the next section which talks about the sophisticated electronic
system used by the 944T to control your boost.

Farzaan.
