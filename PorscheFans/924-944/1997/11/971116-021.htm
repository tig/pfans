I just received my copy of Moss Motoring.  Moss Motors sells parts for
English classics and includes articles and technical tips in the catalog.
 This issue contains information about how to remove anodizing from aluminum
brightwork.

I decided to pass this along since I had read at least one previous post
requesting info about stripping wheels.

The author recommends EASY-OFF OVEN CLEANER and a pair of rubber household
gloves.  A liberal spray followed by a 15 to 20 minute wait and water rinse
does it.  There is a warning about ruined paint but that it does not affect
rubber or glass.

Since I have no experience using this product, I suggest trying this process
on the inside of a wheel first.

Good luck, Claus Groth '86 951

P.S.  Thanks to all who advised that my thermoswitch was defective.  Right
you were.  I just didn't think that both switches inside of the housing would
go bad at the same time but they did.
