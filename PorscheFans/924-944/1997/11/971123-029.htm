Thanks to all who helped me with the oil cooler and radiator.  It's running
great!  Now I have some more questions.

I changed transmission oil this weekend to Red Line to try and quiet down the
noise a bit.  It made it somewhat quieter, but not a lot.  The oil I removed
was blue.  Does anybody have a guess as to what the old oil might have been?
 I'd like to know what I'm comparing the Red Line to.

Also, I have Toyo Proxes tires on the car and would like something more
suitable for street.  Any suggestions?  I have Fuch's with 225/50-16 front
and 245/45-16 rear, and I don't do any track or autocross.  I put on about
5,000 miles per year.
