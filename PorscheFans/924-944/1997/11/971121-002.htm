In an article in Christophorus around 5 years ago Porsche stated that the
924 could run on unleaded petrol while the 931 required every third refill
to be with leaded petrol. I ran my old 924 for 3 years and 70000 Km (40000
miles) using only unleaded fuel and that did not gave any problems.

All versions of the 931 turbo uses the same cylinder head.

Is a 924 engine the same as an Audi engine? Well, yes and no. The engine
has been used in the Audi 100, VW LT truck and the AMC Gremlin, but in very
different configurations.
In the 924 version Porsche has used the best configuration such as a forged
crankshaft, large diameter bearings, fuel injection and so on. What this
means is that you cannot use any of the major parts from other engines, but
all the small parts such as bearing shells, cam followers etc. are the
same, but again you have to be careful to get the correct size bearings.

By the way, does anyone  on the list know the exact differences between a
GT and a GTS engine, such as turbo type numbers etc. ?
