<< I will check it out thanks Bob. I am also having a problem with boost. Iam
not always getting a full boost. The car runs and sounds fine and there does
not seem to be any kind of pattern. I do notice however if I stop and restart
the car I get full boost again,. ANY IDEAS? >>

Lots of things going on in there.  For one, and this had me screwed up for
awhile, the KLR (that's the computer that controls boost and the knock
sensor, and something else) does not let the engine develope full boost in
1st or 2nd gear.  Also, if it detects knock, and can't get rid of it just by
adjusting the ignition timing, it will back off on the boost.

One thing that most of us 951 owners who increase the boost on our cars like
to do is install an aftermarket boost gauge.  Due to the scale on the boost
gauge in the dash, it's not very accurate.
