Hi again-

Does anyone else have problems with grease and oil on their keyboards?  

You know what I mean . . . you start a project on your P-car, run into one of
those judgement issues not covered in the Haynes, ask yourself, "what if I
just take a stab at, and learn two weeks from now from information contained
in someone elses post that I guessed wrong, and now have to dis-assemble and
re-assemble the whole d#!@& thing that took six hours to R&R last time, so
you grab a rag, wipe your hands down as best you can, and run to the blessed
comfort of the PorscheFans list to submit a question to the collective wisdom
of the group, wait 3 minutes without a response and say, scr%*& it, I can't
wait on these guys any more, and run back to the garage to re-install the
laughing pin onto the humorous shaft which is what caused the giggle gear to
break a tickle tooth in the first place.

Question - (I'll give it a full three minutes this time)

How important is that little piece of "foam" which sits between the underside
of the fender and the top of the strut?  If the old one appears to be "shot",
should a suitable replacement be fashioned?  What's the function of the
little bugger?

TIA,
Jeff Fortenbery
