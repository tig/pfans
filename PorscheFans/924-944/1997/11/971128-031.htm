Dana recently posted a message in response to my thoughts on spinning 944s.
There is one part of it that I must take issue with.

There seemed to be an implication that a 130k mile car would inevitably have
problems which might compromise safety. This is almost certainly true if the
car had been neglected. The think is, that ours was not. It had had a major
suspension overhaul not long before the accident (but long enough for any
obvious bugs to have manifested themselves). This car had never gone more
than 6k miles between maintenance inspections in it life, and had been
looked after with no expense spared.

So, are we concluding that at 130k miles a 944 has latent defects that could
cause an accident, even if it has all of the right treatment? I do hope not!
These cars are, I hope, better built than that.

However, if it is the case that a 130k 944 is a sufficient victim of entropy
(Dana's word) that it is an accident waiting to happen, we all ought to know
about it. I for one put 25k miles on my 944 each year - it's my transport,
not my plaything. It is at 98k now, so in little more than a year's time, I
will be in the danger zone. I plan to have major suspension work done next
week but one. However, if we conclude that the car is worn out by 130k, it
just is not worth the money - I may as well scrap it.

For me, this is a really serious issue. Most of my miles are spent on busy
motorways, between 70 and 100mph often in fairly heavy traffic. I cannot
afford to have an entropic failure - it would likely hurt!

I think that this is worthy of debate. It is potentially an issue for us
all. Is it the fact that the cars are normally so benign that leads some of
us into a false sense of security, such that the sudden spins and course
changes are driver error, or is there really a latent problem with the cars?
Maybe, we all have to accept that an old 944 is an entropic hazard, and that
no matter how good the car feels, nor how well it has been looked after, it
is actually past it and needs to be scrapped. I hope not!


I think that the single most interesting thing about this debate is that
there is a pattern. There are those (like I was) who assumed that the cause
could only have been driver error, because this just is not 944 behaviour,
and a significant number of people who have had unexplained accidents in
these cars and would like to find out what might have happened. I don't know
the answer, and I have a genuinely open mind. I personally have driven about
90k miles in various 944s (often with the accelerator hard to the floor) and
have never experienced a moment of instability, even when I have done
something quite daft, like panic braking into a wet downhill corner.
However, there are others, my partner amongst them, that are driving slowly,
and suddenly find themselves taking a quick trip into the scenery.
