6500rpm is 172.5 mph with the Euro Modell.I think that is to optimistic for a non chiped
carTha cat cars are rating at 156.2mph and the non cat at 157.5 mph top speed.
There are also 951 without cat in Germany and they don't have this back pressure
problem. I've never heard of a problems with the 951 cat. The 85 MY 951 didn'thave a cat
only the 86 MY (builded since 06-85). Even the Turbo cup with another exhaust didn't
have problems. My cat is 120000 miles old and still ok, just the lamda sensor have been
replaced after ignition problems.Hello P-Fans

Not only the N0 is an OEM tire but also the N1and N 2. the higher the number the newr
and the better. I have from Porsche 5 sites with the specs for the summer tires. I think
in 1-2 months I will be ready with my home page and you can read the Porsche opinion on
this topic.

>         My friend of mine told me this story:  'That when the 951 came out in 1984

> first Porsche Model to make the same Hp in "Euro trim" and "USA trim".
> Shortly after the Turbo's release, German customers were experiencing a loss
> of horse power after purchase and several miles driven. Porsche dealers were
> finding that the Catalytic Convertors were melting down internally and
> becoming clogged. The Dealers could not fugue out why? Porsche did however -
> it seems that the cars were rated at 152 mph top speed, but on long stretches

> cars hit their rev limiters at 6500 rpm's (?). How fast is that? 163 mph.
> When the engine's ECU see's that the engine is exceeding Max rpm's - the ECU

> higher.  These cars were frequently reaching and exceeding the Max rev rpm's
> - the presence of raw fuel being dumped into the cat at those speeds caused

> @830 rpm's. The CO% limit in Va is 1.20%.
>         I've talked to Al Collins @AutoThority about 951 performance upgrades - here
> is what he said.  "When you install a "test pipe" to bypass the catalytic
> convertor - the test pipe will lower the back pressure by 2 psi. The 951 has
> something like 22 psi of back pressure (if memory serves me correct) and
> anything lower than 20 psi (such as when a test pipe is installed) will cause
> engine damage. The reason is that the Factory ECU mapping takes advantage of
> a "EGR" effect do to valve timing overlap. As the combustion cycle occurs - a
> small amount of exhaust gas gets pumped back into the cylinder with incomming
> fuel/air charge - this allows the Factory & Chip makers to add ignition
> timing to increase throttle response and horse power. When you have an
> exhaust that lower the back pressure too much - bellow that 20 psi level, you
> no longer have that  "EGR-effect" needed to sustain the ignition timing.
> Result is detonation and/or blown head gasket. This is also why 17 psi is the
> limit for Max boost level with a "stock" or "chipped" ECU".
