Whoa, wait a second.  What class does the 951 run in in the SCCA.  I was
under the impression that the 951 could NOT run in ANY SCCA class but
Porsche unlimitted...

I am sure Autopower makes one.  I have similar plans (to race), and I think
that a custom cage is the way to go.  It does cost more, but I think the
extra stiffness, safety, and foot room is well worth it...

Find someone who has lots cage experience, and preferably with Porsches.
Bill at OG Racing could probably help...
