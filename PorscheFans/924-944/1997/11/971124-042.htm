Hello all,  About two months ago I posted a question concerning a loose shift
lever.
I was instructed to check the linkage and change the lever and plastic cup
that the lever ball sits in. When I checked the linkage, I found that the
adjustment bolt was almost completely out. I tightened it, the probelm was
fixed!!
I checked the lever, and cup, both appear good as new ( they were replaced
prior to me buying the car) The problem is, I have had to re-tighten the bolt
four times since then. I have used red and blue loc-tite, and torqued it down
until I thought it was going to snap. But three weeks later, I,m stuck on the
side of the road with no transmission. Today it happened again, so I took it
to the dealer, they checked it out, said the linkage adjustment plate had
also been replaced prior to me buying the car ( they had done the work) and
that the bolt just needed to be tightened again. The entire process took 5
minutes. It now works good as new, but I am skeptical as to it staying tight.
ARE THERE ANY TRICKS OUT THERE TO KEEP THIS THING TIGHT ???? Does this happen
to other cars, or just mine?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
