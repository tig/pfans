This is farily easy to diagnose. First by sound. Alternator bearings frequently
give the sound close to an electric razor running at slow speed. More of a buzz
than a whine. Compressors have a couple of bearing sets which can fail. One is
the bearing on the clutch. This can be isolated because it will stop when the
compressor is turned on. The other bearing set are the bearings in the compressor
proper. These will not whine when the compressor is off.

Finally, you can buy a cheap mechanics stethoscope, or use a long screwdriver or
even a stick to find out which component is making the noise. In the case of the
screwdriver or stick, put one end near your ear and press the other end on
the alternator or compressor while the engine is running. You can hear more than
your would think using this technique. Usual safety warnings apply while messing
around under the hood with the engine running, belts turning, ties flapping,
fingers probing, etc.

Alternator bearings can be replaced cheaply at any competent alternator/motor
shop. The A/C clutch bearing can be replaced by buying a new or rebuilt compressor
pulley. Replacement does not require complete removal of the compressor and is
pretty simple. Compressor bearing failure will require replacement of the 
compressor.

Good luck,

Doug
