Hey porschefans,

My little ole' 78 924 is still out at the shop, I went to pick it up after a
freshly rebuilt head was installed. Started her up and let her idle while I
spoke with the mechanic for ten or fifteen minutes (and forked over a tidy
sum), as I was pulling out the mechanic comes running out and stops me. He
pops the hood and tells me to pull her back in and shut her down. It seems
that my freshly rebuilt head was functioning well, but my rings weren't
anymore and the engine was ejecting a fine oil mist via my dipstick. He tells
me that the increased compression due to the new head caused the rings to
fail (because they are old). He was also really upset the he had a "comeback"
and didn't think to talk me into replacing the rings and main bearings from
the beginning. So now he's rebuilding the lower end, and charging me only for
parts and materials.  So is he really the good-hearted sole I think he is, or
did he screw something up in the first place?? 
oh, and least i forget, he did run the engine prior to my arrival without
incident.
Opinions or advice welcomed,
Thanks,
Eric (ericj001@aol.com)
78-924 beheaded for spitting oil at the mechanic :)'''
