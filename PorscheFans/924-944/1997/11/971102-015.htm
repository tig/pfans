  In my one and only dealing with Automobile Atlanta I found them to be rude and
didn't have a clue about what they did and didn't have in stock.  I ordered a
Flex Air Dam for my Porsche 924 on a Thursday (I had a race in the following
weekend) and was told that they weren't sure if they had it, but if they didn't
they would no later than Monday and then it would ship out and I would have it my
Thursday.  Well Thursday arrived and no Air Dam.  I called them and the woman
that answered didn't have a clue, she said they weren't expecting to receive any
for some time, btw no mention of when this would be.  I told her to cancel the
order, which was done, but to send my a catalog.  This was over two months ago
and I have still not received a catalog.  I guess they just don't want my
business which is to bad since I completely rebuilding my car and I'm in need of
many parts.

  Also I did have great service from Tweeks, the company that everyone around
here told me to stay away from.  I called them on Thursday afternoon, about 3pm,
to find out if they had the Flex Air Dam.  I was told they did have one and could
ship it out overnight, but I was to later I would have to have them deliver it on
Saturday.  This was kinda of a problem since we were planning on living for the
track on Saturday, but I could wait since my front valance broke and I needed to
replace it.  About a 1/2 hour later I received a call from Tweeks to inform me
that they would drop off the Air Dam at the UPS office and I would receive it on
Friday.....this was at no extra cost.  This was great.  There price was a little
higher, about $20, but I didn't care I got my Air Dam.
