PFans,
As promised last week I replaced all four tires, front shocks, and front
suspension bushings, ie control arm and stabilizer bar. She's aligned and
now I have a new car, sorry...Porsche-there is no substitute.

Some observations...
   The tires made by far the biggest improvement. That is really no
surprise as I was riding on horrible rubber. When I bought the car a year
ago there was good tread but as I discovered afterwards the tires were not
balanced and as such were out of round. I had them balanced but had trouble
with balance weights removing themselves at highway speeds. So I left the
tires as they were knowing I would be replacing them soon. Of course their
condition worsened. Against the good advice of the list I went with BFG
Comp TA H-rated. I really don't put much stress on the tires(all highway)
so I figured I would put savings into other Pcar stuff. No complaints with
the BFGs however I am no expert on tires. Anything that rolls... Well maybe
one...I would have preferred more road feel. The steering feels pretty
light. On the pro side the ride is straight and true without a trace of
shimmy in the steering wheel. Hooray!
   I put Boge gas shocks in. Really cant tell much difference the shocks
made. Probably masked by the new bushings. I saw the originals...and I
thought the tires were horrible! Pull the piston out,let go, falls right
back in. 
   Porsche OE suspension bushings. Gave it a softer ride(again probably a
combination with the shocks). Lightened up the steering some more. Again I
would prefer a firmer ride. Next time(huh?) I'll know. For the good it
removed almost all the vibration at low rpm. All that is left is secondary
to bad motor mounts. On the negative side now I have understeer which I
don't like(somebody tell me I'm imagining this). I've increased tire
pressure in the rears and that has made it tolerable.
   Its nice to have one finger control on the highway.
   Y'all have a good day!
