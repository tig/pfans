This did not make it to the digest, so I'm reposting, sorry to the real-time
guys who will get this twice.

You are correct to some extent.  In my original email, I forgot one key
word.  However, if you read deeper into the paragraph it was fairly
clear that I meant that the pressure line should still be hooked up.

This is what I originally wrote:

>If you removed EVERY electronic gizmo between the wastegate

There should have been the word "take" between the "and" and the "a".
If you read further however, you will note:

>a purely mechanical point of view, when the wastegate senses that there is
>0.2bar pressure on the diaphragm, it will force the wastegate to open and

I said that "when the wastegate senses 0.2bar pressure on the diaphragm,
it will force the wastegate to open".  If there was no connection to the
intake piping, there would be no pressure on the diaphragm.

Further I wrote:

>to 0.2bar boost, this is because all of the electronic gizmos in between
>the intake manifold and the wastegate shut down and allow all of the pressure

OK, we are over this point now.  If this is the only misconception you
have, why the anger?  I've done everything I can on this list to give
true representations of what I've learned in the past and present.  I
provided DYNO proof at my own expense when people were still guessing
at HP figures for chips.  Why are you so damn angry at me?

Bandwidth drivel?  Maybe to your eyes.  Out of 1360 people, you are the
only one to voice a concern.  I respect quite a few members of this list,
Barry Lenoble, the great Jim Richmond, and many more have written saying
they liked it.  I even respected your opinions in the past, but this time
you went a little too far.

>If your going to write multi-page technical dessertations, do some proof

Out of a huge three page document, one word missing is not too bad, and
if you read it further, it was clear what I meant.

The terminal velocity was 107.3mph.  The R/T was a pathetic 0.678, although
that doesn't count in your 1/4 mile so no big deal.  The 60' was a 1.765.
The gas used was 94 octane Chevron, car weight with driver was 3290lbs,
boost pressure was 22psi on a TD05-16G Mitsubishi turbocharger.  The ET
as you know was 12.7.

>horsepower on the dragstrip.  I have seen 2.0 liter, air cooled, carbureted
>VW's  run 10 second 1/4 miles! 

I'm glad for you, did it weigh 3290lbs and did it run 94 octane real world
gas?  Before we go into this one too far, keep in mind that this is not
the fastest Talon or anything like that.  I feel that it was a big
accomplishment in setting up a street car in full street trim, even normal
tire pressures to run a 12.7 @ 107.  With the same components I had, Marc
Hallman (designer of the MH boost controller) ran a 12.3 @ 111mph, but with
race gas, a bit more boost and a few hundred pounds of weight reduction.

Where do you get this "abole all that" nonsense from?  I'm the most eager
person to learn and also the most eager to share what I've learned.

For the record, I highly respect the likes of Jim Pasha, Bruce Anderson,
Ken Gross, and George B.

So, you get pissed at me for saying what you wrote was crap, then you call
mine chatter?  Oh well.  My friend, you are so far off in left field, I
can't even see you anymore.  I give up.  My only advice to you, if you want
to be the enforcer of this list, or if you want to slam people, why the hell
don't you write the damn articles yourself?  Just hope for your sake, you
don't leave out one word!

Farzaan.
Yes, I'm upset.
