I have two questions regarding my '84 944 and its lights and fog lamps.

1. For the last two nights the headlights have been behaving strangely.
About 5 times now, the lights went out, stayed out for about 4 seconds
and came back on. No flickering or anything, just pitch black and then
full lights again. This was accompanied by a relay-type click. When the
lights went off they did not recess, they stayed up. So the headlight
relay is unlikely to be the culprit (it cycles the motor and the lights
would have gone down). No recent changes other than a little lubricant
on the light raising assembly this weekend.

2. I tried flashing an idiot trying to turn in front of me on an amber
light, on icy roads, and the lights would not flash. I had my fog lamps
on at the time. Would somebody with an older 944 please test flashing
with 
a) no lights on 
b) parking lights on and 
c) fog-lamps and parking lights on -- and let me know what happens? If I
remember right this is how my lights used to work:
a) with no lights on flashing activated the fog-lamps
b) with parking lights on (with or without fog-lamps), flashing would
turn the main headlights on at high beam -- kind of flap them up and
down.

Currently this is what I get:
a) with no lights or parking lights on (with or without fog-lamps),
flashing activates the main headlights on high beam, but they stay
recessed! In other words they shine their 80 watts right into the bumper
when I flash.
b) with the lights on everything works normally, i.e. flashing activates
both high and low beams, until I pull the switch back far enough to
switch to high beam.

Please remember this is an '84, so the fog lamps are almost an
independent circuit -- they do not shut off on high beam. TIA.
