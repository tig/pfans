No, if you buy a RHD 924 it will be a Euro model. These have 125HP stock
(all years) and are capable of at least 130mph.

You could try a K&N and a new throttle body first. I've done these mods to
my 924, and they certainly helped.

I doubt it. You would have to do some serious modifications and convert the
924 to use five-lug wheels all over. Standard is 4-lug.

From what I hear, 924s are very expensive in New Zealand, so I doubt you'll
get all this for $11,000.
