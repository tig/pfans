Out here on the east-cost Potomac runs one of the best programs around.


The cost is about $75 / day

The attendees are broken into 5 groups  (Green - Blue -white - Black
-Red) Green being beginners less that 5-10 track days
Black & red being instructors or days greater than (lots)


We supply and instructor for everyone in Green & Blue, and optional in
White. There are 4 - 20 min track sessions for all, and a 40 min
classroom session for green and blue students.

I also teach for Bill Scott Racing, where the cost is a lot higher, and
most of the time you get the same instructors as BSR draws from PCA as
does Track Time. The PCA venue is a better one, and you get the same
instrutor the weekend which helps.

All in all it is a great way to get knowledge, and track time.

Potomac has a separate auto-X program that works in a similar method.

	>Hearing about all this exciting talk about PCA driving
school... Just how
	$$$ are they?  
	<

	Our fall driving school here at San Diego PCA cost $150, up $25
from the
	previous spring one.  They are always sold out in advance.  It
starts with
	a Friday night classroom/chalk talk with food, driving manual
and t-shirt. 
	Saturday is all out driver training with skid pads, accident
avoidance
	simulator, limit braking, slalom or linked turns,
increasing/decreasing
	radius turns, pitch and catch (personal favorite),
mini-autocross, and
	corner worker instruction.  A water truck to make half the
exercises really
	entertaining and breakfast and lunch.

	Sunday is a practice untimed autocross.  You get far more seat
time than a
	regular a-x.  Kiss those tires goodbye!  Again breakfast and
lunch.

	Those who attended and have previously attended professional
(big bucks)
	schools were impressed with the quality and low price.  Having
only
	attended the PCA school, I was highly impressed with the
instruction.  You
	learn good solid basics and what your car is capable of doing
including
	spins.
