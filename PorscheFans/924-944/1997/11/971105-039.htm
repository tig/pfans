As I said earlier, I'm replacing my blown head gasket on my 85.5 944. 
I'm going to have the head decked for flatness and lap the valves while
it's out.  Here's the question.  Since I'm having the head shaved and it
costs no more to remove material I'm decking it a bit for higher
compression.  The local shop says the motor won't mind at all, as
European cars use higher compression pistons anyway.  The only problem
is that the more you take off the more adjustment you lose on the
cambelt.  The shop recommends taking half a millimeter off, but says it
will run much better with a full millimeter removed.  They caution that
the belts would need to be changed earlier if I do go that far. Does
anyone have any experience with this question?  How much do I have
removed and will the difference between half a millimeter and a full
millimeter really matter as far as belt tension goes?  

Thanks alot Pfans.  Oh and George, thanks for straightening me out on
the water in the oil deal.  Don Istook (spelling?) is also a gem on this
list.  Thanks.
