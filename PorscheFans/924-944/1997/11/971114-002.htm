Jon,=20
I put the fiberglass turbo conversion nose from AIR on my 85.5 944 about =
4 months ago. It fits almost perfectly, and is great.
The car looks much better w/ the turbo nose. If you have about 8 hours, =
and a friend or two to help, I would suggest putting the nose on =
yourself.  I was quoted a couple hundred dollars to install it, so I did =
it myself w/ two friends. It really isn't that hard, you just have to be =
careful and put up w/ fiberglass getting everywhere. If you want to know =
the exact details of the installation, as well as how to mount and =
connect the turn signals (I haven't bothered to buy the foglights, but =
it looks good anyway) then let me know, and I will write a complete =
description and post it. Good luck :-)=20

PS I plan on posting pictures of my car once I get a site set up so I'll =
let you know. =20
