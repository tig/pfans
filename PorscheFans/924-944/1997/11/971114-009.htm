Hi, Marv,

Certainly, this will not work with pre 1985/2 cars (that header panel is
spot welded in place)...

In addition, on 1985/2 and newer cars, to remove the header panel,  you will
also need to remove
the two 10 mm bolts which secure the header panel to the fenders (at the
outermost points) and
the two hidden Phillips head sheet metal screws which are inboard of the
headlights at the bottom
of the header panel.

My own preferred method is to remove the engine undertray (yet another
reason that I leave mine
off all the time anyway) and to reach up between the radiator fans and the
engine itself and use
a large screwdriver or a prybar to release the hood.

Good Luck!

|You are lucky, I was just reading about this last night.
|
|According to the "Good Book", you need a thin Phillips screwdriver to
|undo the screws that sit between the front lip of the hood and the panel
|that the hood crest is mounted on.  After all of those screws are
|removed, you must slide the panel with the hood crest forward.  The only
|fasteners holding the panel on are those that boarder the front of the
|hood.
|
|Now I can't say how to best slide that panel forward, but I would
|consider a pry bar with a good insulator between it and the sheet metal,
|of course.
|
|Once off, the release mechanism should be accessible once the panel is
|off.
|
|Good luck!
