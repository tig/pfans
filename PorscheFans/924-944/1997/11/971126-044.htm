Hi,

Now that my '89 951 deal has fallen through, or should I say, gone to
hell, I find myself tempted by a local '90 944 S2 I drove today.  I knew
about the car before my ill fated trip to Tennessee, but at the time I
thought the 951 purchase was a much better deal.  Live and learn.

Anyway, the car I drove today had 30,301 miles on it after the test =
drive.
It looks and drives like new.  It's Guards Red/Black leather.  Not much =
in
the way of options except the standard stuff and the leather seats, and a
set of Dunlop SP8000 tires.  It really was nearly flawless.  The only
problem was a very minute 1" slight crease in the aft quarter panel.

As opposed to the previous, somewhat tired S2 I drove, this car had lots
of grunt.  Not nearly as much as my son's turbo of course, but it had =
much
better power below 3 grand, and would probably be a much better car for =
my
wife to drive, which she will do on occasion.  I drove it through some
good twisties and the torque is nice to have.

The major problem is the asking price of $18,500.  I know this is way too
much money, but frankly, at this point I'd rather pay a little too much
for a car I want, then save $5K and get a much less desirable car.  As a
consequence, I will probably make an offer since I feel this S2 would =
last
me for a long time with proper TLC.  I don't think there are buyers
standing in line to pay $18,500 for an S2.  If there are, that's fine,
another car will come along.  Actually, at $18.5K, a 968 looks like a =
much
more viable option as those are in the under $20K bracket now and are a
more desirable car in many ways.  Trouble is finding one...

Turns out there is also an '89 951 for sale locally, and I knew about =
this
one also, but its price was $25,900 on consignment at the local Ferrari
dealer.  It's a 43K mile car in Velvet Red Metallic.  This car is still
priced way, way, above a rational value at $24K, but it has been for sale
for many months, so I plan to look at it and make an offer anyway now =
that
it is back in the hands of the owner.

I could be happy with either car.  The S2 is much easier to purchase
because of its significantly higher loan value, and I think the 951 owner
thinks his car is worth a small fortune as a collector's car, so I don't
expect him to drop the price enough to make it a viable option, but you
never know.

We'll see,
