I just replaced the power steering hose that runs from the reservoir to the
pump.  I cranked up the car and turned the wheel lock to lock  a couple of
times then looked at the pump to make sure it wasn't leaking.  I noticed
fluid on the bottom of the pump.  I wiped it off and had my wife turn the
wheel lock to lock when I was looking at the pump.  I noticed fluid seeping
from the pump housing where it is bolted together.  It only seemed to do it
when it was turned all the way to the left.

Can the power steering pump be rebuilt.  I'm thinking there is a bad oring
inside where the housing is bolted together.  Or am I going to have to bite
the bullet and buy a new one.  I only saw Automotion's catalog and it was
$155.  Does anyone know of a good source that is cheaper or know of a
rebuild kit?

TIA

(please "reply to all" since I don't get the list in non-digest mode)
