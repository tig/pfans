Re G Muncey's oil change frequency, No way I would go 12K, I don't care who
recommends it. Standard practice is 3K for an aggressively maintained car,
not a family beater. The Click and Clack's of the world suggest that closer
to the 6 or 7K most new cars require is better for the environment, as more
frequent changes are not really necessary, but porsche engines are run much
closer to the limits than buick engines and changing oil at 3k is insanely
cheap compared to any other p-car maintenance. Using synthetics may be the
only good reason for extending the frequency to say 5k, as they suffer less
breakdown, but my experience is as an engine gets older more crud builds up
on the moving parts and the fresh detergent dosing of new oil helps keep this
down. Environmentally, I figure if a car lasts 5K more due to 3K oil changes
that should easily justify the extra few gallons of oil and filters,
especially if you are getting the waste oil recyled.
