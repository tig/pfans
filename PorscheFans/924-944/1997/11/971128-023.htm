This is typically (assuming the rotors were never turned) caused by
heat-soaking (not letting the rotors/brake system cool enough before
stopping the car after a run).

If the shudder is *really* bad, you may have lucked out and all the
heat-soaking has done is deposit a layer of brake pad material on the rotor
at a particular place. This is easily noted by a dark outline of the brake
pad on the rotor. If this is the case, the whole issue will go away after
3-4k km's of driving. This happens more often than you think.

I personally wouldn't run (typically) turned rotors on the track. Often too
much material is removed, which seriously compromises the heat dissipation
abilities of the rotor.

Most places that do slotting will slot your rotors. That way you can buy
factory rotors of known quality and have them slotted. Be aware the
slotting *will* reduce pad life, and should only be done as a last result.
I investigated the situation fairly thoroughly earlier in the year, and
decided to put a cool-brake kit on my S2 in lieu of slotting rotors.

In answer to your original question :-), KVR Performance
(www.nikon-kvr.com/KVR_BRAKES.html) does slotting (and drilling), but
probably isn't cost-effective for you to use (then again, the CDN$ is so
low that it may be worth it).
