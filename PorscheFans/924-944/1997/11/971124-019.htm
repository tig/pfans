To all:

Last week I noticed a post about the use of unleaded fuel in a Porsche.
The particular car was a Euro-spec 931 (924 Turbo). 

There is absolutely NO problem with using unleaded fuel in your
924/944/928/911/930/914-6. You simply must observe the required octane
for your year and model. Period.

My 931 was a Euro-spec car and had no problems over the 14 year period I
owned it. Never apart, the turbo was the original and it still ran as
strong as the day I picked it up in Zuffenhausen. Thanks to using
unleaded fuel, a few inspections revelaed that there were no deposits on
the pistons and spark plug life was about 15,000 miles (24,000km)
Unleaded fuel is a boon to the Porsche owner in that your exhaust system
will last longer, the turbo will last longer, spark plugs will retain
their gap longer, less breakdown of the oil, etc. 

You will note that I excluded the 356/912 and 914-4. The reason is that
the valve seats are somewhat softer in these engines and might erode
over time. The time period might be about 60,000 miles or so if not
maintained properly. 

Experience in the US indicates that the models cited have extremely long
service lives (excepting the 931) and have relatively few problems with
valve trains under most circumstances. The 931 has problems related to
thermal mass and location of the turbo, but the design is still very
sound and the engines will last if a knowledgeable mechanic maintains
it. 

The key to valve life without lead is the hardness of the valve seats,
which must be about a rockwell hardness of about 65. All of the Porsches
in the first group are well over 85. Bruce Anderson, myself and a few
others have tested the seat hardness, both new and old, and inspected
many engines after tear-down and have found very little indication that
unleaded fuels cause damage.

Now, incorrect valve adjustment, bad cam followers, mechanical failures
of the valve spring/retainers cause 97% of the failures.

SO, if you observe the octane requirements of your Euro-spec Porsche,
you should have no problems with unleaded fuel.
