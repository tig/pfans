Just my $.02.  I live about 10 miles from Automobile Atlanta.  I used to
use them as my #1 parts source until recently.  Last month I replaced my
waterpump, timing and balance belts, all rollers, and all hoses.  I bought
all the parts from AA except the balance shaft seal kit.  

I dropped by on my lunch hour to get the parts and they only had the pump
in stock.  Everything else they had to get from their local parts
distributor.  They keep next to nothing in stock for 924-944's.  I went
back the next day to get the rest of the stuff.  The next day, Saturday, I
started the "job".  I found out they didn't give me any of the pieces to go
with the updated pump - it is a kit actually that includes the belt guide,
bigger cam belt idler, and the template to cut the rear belt cover.  They
also gave me two wrong rollers.  By the time I realized all of this they
were closed and I was at a standstill.  

I called Sean at AA on Monday (who btw is a very helpful) and told him
everything that was wrong.  He had to re-order some of the parts and I went
down there at lunch to get them.  I get down there and find out one of the
rollers didn't come in so I'd have to come back.  I picked up a new crank
seal (which i forgot to get originally) while I was there.

I get home that night and try to get as much done as I can with the parts I
have.  I should be able to get everything installed but the belts.  THE
CRANK SEAL IS TOO BIG.  I called the next day and he had to re-order a
crank seal too.  When I called before lunch to go get the parts, the roller
still wasn't in.  I told him I'll just go to the dealer and I'd stopped by
and get a refund on all the wrong parts later - he says no problem.  

I went to the dealer (Jim Ellis Porsche) and bought the right roller
(balance shaft tensioner) and come to find out it was $42 cheaper.  I paid
around $24 and AA was charging me $66.  I called both places before I
started buying parts and the dealer said all the rollers were about $200
and AA said $150, go figure.

Anyway, I didn't want to take up so much BW.  I just want people to know
that AA is a good place but they don't keep much in stock for 944s AND they
don't specialize in 944s.  They work on alot of them but they are mostly a
914 shop.  If the 914 business would pay all the bills I doubt they would
even mess with 944s.  And, if you ever get George on the phone, hang up,
call back and ask for Sean.  I don't know what George's problem is but he
acts like he is doing you a favor buy taking your money - very snotty.  I
thought I was going to have an "AJ Foyt" flashback one time when I was in
there.
