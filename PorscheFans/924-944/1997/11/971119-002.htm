Maybe

There are two possibilities:

1. he lied
2. he didn't do the job right

Your description very much sounds like a broken rubber centered clutch.
To check 1: did he have reciepts for the parts, did he have the Haynes 
manual or the Porsche manuals. I am in the process of my second 
clutch replacement (on 2 different cars that is) and I would say that
you can not do the job without the proper manuals. It will take me
(a reasonably experienced mechanic) about 7 to 8 hours just to 
remove everything (gearbox, exhaust, bellhousing). However I have
to admit that I am a very carefull mechanic, it usually takes me twice
as long to disassemble things than it takes me to assemble everything
back together because I do not want to break anything when I am taking
the thing apart. I also do a lot of extra checking when I am taking
things apart. In my experience this time is well spent because this
makes the assembly part much easier.

Good luck,

Paul
