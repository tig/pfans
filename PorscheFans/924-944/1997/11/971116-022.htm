All,

When my clutch finally goes out (hopefully later than sooner!!), I'm
considering rebuilding (or having rebuilt, as the case may be) my
transmission and installing a Quaiffe.  Obviously new syncros are in order.
 What about gears??  My '86 951 doesn't have the forged 1st and 2nd like the
S does.  The ultimate goal of this car is to stroke it when it finally needs
an engine overhaul (hopefully not until about 225,000 miles or so), so I want
the transmission to be bulletproof if possible.  

I'm already assuming $2500 for the rebuild and Quaife.  Should any new gears
be included in this?  It seems to me that if the S had forged 1st and 2nd,
and my goal is FAR more power, that new 1st and 2nd gears are in order.
 Would this require all new gears?(i.e., 1st through 5th, & reverse)?  How
much would new gears cost me, and could the old gears be sold as used?  

How about the ring and pinion?  I've heard people blow these up occasionally.
 If I'm not mistaken, I'm talking another $1000 for a new ring and pinion,
but as with the gears, it seems like a new ring and pinion would be in order.

Finally, if new gears and ring and pinion are in order, any recommendations
or comments on new ratios??

Thanks in advance (and sorry for initiating the big boost war fiasco,
although I learned ALOT, which is the idea of this board, and personally, I
think some people made more out of it than it was)

Bob
