Does any one know where to get a replacement top (either canvass only or
frame and canvass). It seems that the pins (I forget the name of them) that
hold the boot cover on have worn the top in spots particularly on the
passenger side. they don't leak and are not all the way through yet but
they look pretty  ugly to me at least and with winter approaching I don't
need the leaks. I just got off the phone with a local Porsche dealer and
the parts guy quoted me are you ready for this $9000.00 for canvass and
frame, not counting labor and $2000.00 for the canvass only. He also
suggested that I bring the car in to have them assess the problem at the
rate of $80.00 per hour. I think I'll pass on their assessment. Any way the
car is a 1990 944 S2 Cabrio red with the slightly scarred black top. 47k
new belts at 40k. the only other problem I have is two dead little flies in
the instrument cluster. They probably came in through the fresh air duct,
they probably died from watching the speedo and tach.
