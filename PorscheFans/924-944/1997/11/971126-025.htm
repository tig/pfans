As many may recall, I have had one heck of a time keeping the inner CV bolts
in my 951 from backing out.  This occurs in AX or track events.  I have had
situations where CV's have broken on the street a day or two after an event,
leaving me stranded.  Recently, I tried mild Loctite to keep 'em in.  I
cleaned everything carefully, and was quite meticulous, using brandy new high
grade normal Allen head bolts in place of the star-type originals.  After one
day of track testing, they still backed out!  It seems that the Redline CV
grease which I use wicks up the threads...

Well, I bought a drill press for $50 (I needed one anyway), some new bolts,
and some 1/16" cobalts bits (4).  I then bought a safety wire tool from Racer
Wholesale, and some safety wire.  Now the things are Loctited and
safety-wired.  Wasn't very difficult to do.  Will test at Laguna on Friday,
and see if this works.

If you get under your car from time to time, check to ensure that your CV
bolts are torqued properly,  Also watch out for the large rear stub axle nut.
 These have been known to back off.  Keep and eye out.  If you don't work on
your car, have your mechanic check them from time to time.  Especially if you
do AX/track events.
