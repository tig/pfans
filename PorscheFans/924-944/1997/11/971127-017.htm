Hello Nick & P-Fans
	During the operating conditions a sulfur odor (rotten eggs) may be noticed
from the tail pipe. There are two causes for this to happen.  1) Sulfur
content of the gasoline. 2) The "rotten egg smell" is a byproduct of any
three way catalytic convertor. The Cat stores Sulfur Tri-oxide compounds and
releases them during the riches running conditions, ie: idling or WOT heavy
acceleration. During which the Sulfur Trioxides is converted into Hydrogen
Sulfide (H2S) within the convertor. Hydrogen Sulfide has the characteristic
rotten egg smell. 
	You can try switching brands of gasoline. Usually premium grades contain
less sulfur than regular grade. The sulfur content can vary by region or
brand name. Once you do switch it will take several tank full - before any
change might be noticed. The rotten egg odor will tends to lessen as the
convertor ages - usually after 10K miles. 		You might also try a fuel
additive:  CD-2. I've used this additive before on customers cars - it
usually helps. CD-2 is found in Pep Boys, Track Auto, NAPA, ect... It is one
of those miracle in a jar additives to help your car pass the emissions test
- it also gets rid of the rotten egg smell! You could also try adjusting the
engines CO% slightly leaner - it might be running too rich. 
	The rotten egg smell does not indicate a failed or failing cat/convertor! 
			
					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
