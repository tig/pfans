Tom,
Sorry to hear about the 951 fiasco in Tennessee. May I offer two pieces of
advice:
1. - Don't let it ruin whatever faith you had in humanity, then they win, and
they don't deserve it.
2. - (If you have not already done this) Place ads seeking your desired ride
in the porshche classified of a few select papers indicating your interest in
a cash purchase of (describe vehicle here). Many special interest cars are
sold this way at very reasonable prices by more affluent owners who recognize
the insult of a trade in offer from the lexus dealer, but don't want the
hassle of placing an ad and having to respond to and hang around for all
kinds of folks to look a their car. Its the best bet for finding that low
mileage, low abuse, high mileage doctor-owned-car without waiting for it to
come to you. These sellers will be looking in the paper for price reality
checks, and thats when you want them to see your ad. Its a whole lot cheaper
than flying all over the country. Also, there are many many p-cars in the bay
area due to extreme affluence (like bellevue is beginning to experience) and
even a nice 951 just does not cut it down there as prestige iron, so it might
be worth an ad down there too, expecially since you can fly down there and
back for close to a hundred bucks. Good luck. You'll find it, and it won't
suck!
