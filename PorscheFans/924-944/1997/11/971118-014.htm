Well, what you are doing is against federal law, unless the car is used on
the
racetrack only...

Chances are, you would be nabbed by the Californazi emissions people during
your
smog check, as well..

Probably better to leave it as it is...

|Hi Folks,
| I plan on doing some track events soon in my 86 951 and I have
|heard that is is a good idea to remove the catalytic converter to avoid
|burning it up. I understand that it builds up tremendous heat from extended
|runs. I beleive it was Jim Pasha (of Excellence) who wrote that replacing
|it with a hollowed out used one would help aleviate this.  How easy is this
|to do on a regular basis as my car is street driven as well. Is it simply
|undoing the bolts/nuts on the exhaust tube and removing a section? Should I
|have flanges welded into section?  Is it necessary for runs which are
|probably only 30 minutes long (at tracks like laguna seca and willow
|springs). TIA
