I'm sorry but the moment I read this I had to laug   . I went through the
same stuff this summer. I put the rubber coating on the battery tray and
on the other side too. But it still leaked. 
Well Joseph there's other places I found that will leak.
1) Between the windshield and the body. If you can take off the molding
and you will see what I'm talking about.
2)At the air box oppenning, just for the kicks pour in some water to the
openning. (just kidding)
3) Here's the most wired one, I found a small p       (white in color)
circle on the battery side really close to the fender. It will be a little
bigger than adime. I have no idea what this is. but there was a hole in
the middle of it(very small) but it sent large amounts of water to the
passenger side. To confiem you can take a jug full of water and start
pouring little by little to this area. If you see bubles forming then you
found the biggest problem. A rubber plug or some sealent would work on
this. After I plugged this hole my leaking problem stopped. 
If you cant find this small plastic thing then use the jug and pour little
by little on each area at atime. and look for leaks inside. Good luck.
