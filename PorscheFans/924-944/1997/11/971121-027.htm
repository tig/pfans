There is metal spinning. The throw out bearing spins at the speed of
pressure plate (engine RPM) when the clutch is engaged. As you release
pressure on the clutch pedal (let it out), the throw out bearing
dis-engages. That spinning sound, most likely, is throw out bearing
noise (yes, there are also normally, other "spinning" sounds too..), and
probably nothing to be terribly concerned with. If the noise begins to
sound like "marbles rolling around inside a tin can", then it's time to
be instantly concerned...

I don't know where you live (i.e. - temps) but this is normal, too. 
Just check the work order from the mechanics shop. It should state what
they refilled the transmission with (type/weight). You can either check
your owners manual which will tell you the proper type for your car (in
the back under Specifications), or send me an email. Anyway, when the
transmission is cold & the outside temp. is cold, shifting is noticeably
"balkier". A change in transmission oil would probably make it more
noticeable as well depending on the age/condition and what
viscosity/grade was replaced...

Hope this helps you out...
