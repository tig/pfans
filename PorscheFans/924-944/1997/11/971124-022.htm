Hi,

Perhaps readers have come across the noise below and know what it is and
how to cure it...

It is a 2-phase (da-da) knocking sound coming from the near side (in UK
driving sense) rear part of the car and often occurs when the car
brakes. It is as if the car tilts forward and something at the rear on
the near side moves and causes a knock-knock noise.

The noise isn't very loud but it is noticable. The car is an '88 944
Turbo. The near side rear drive shaft CV joints have just been repaired.
The near-side rear brake disks were replaced a few months ago. The rear
hatch appears to seat and lock correctly. The rear exhaust section was
replaced a few months ago too. The rear windscreen wiper appears solidly
mounted.

As far as I know the potential sources for the noise are :-

brakes, suspension, wheel, axle, exhaust, rear hatch, rear wiper.

Regards.... Chris
