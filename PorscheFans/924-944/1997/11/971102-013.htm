Hey Guys/Gals,
 I have been away from the list for some time, actually I
was
dropped from the list automatically. Anyway I have some bad /good news.
Past week my 77' 924 was making a loud noise, sounded more like a BUS. The
engine seem to run fine but there was a nasty clunk, clunk sound. 
Since I was busy with school I couldn't look at it.
Saturday I showed it to my friend, and said 
" I think the noise is coming from the front of the car, must be one of
these pulleys."
Then I drove it to his place. was doing 75mph, nothing happens. 
On the way back, I stop at a stop sign, Try to pull away and I hear
something mettle falling, my alternator light comes on, I turned into
automatic pilot, turn the key off. (I can't believe how fast I did it, I
think this is in all the Porsche drivers sub-con, any lights come on
, turn the key off!)
Anyway I get out of my car I see the alternator belt laying on the road
and the pulley on the side of the road. Tow the car back to my place(I
remember what my mechanic told me, "If your gonna keep this one then have
another car" He was right) I look at the pulley and the bolt is still
attached to it, but looks like it broke off.

Here's my question,
This pulley is not connected to the timing belt, it's the one the
alternator hooks into, Does any of you guys/gals out there know which
pulley is this one. My guess is the water pump. 
Anyway I'm so glad this didn't happen when I was doing 75mph. Wow that
would be baaaad. Next time I know better, not to ignore my baby (no
gender)
Thanks in advance
