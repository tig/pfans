Wow, been-there done that!

Few things:

1.	Convert to AAA Plus (covers 100 miles per tow)
2.	You may have had a belt slip, and then it's O-S******, but your
shop can spot that fast. 
3.	We fought chasing the same symptom on my 944 for 4 weeks Shop
changed DME relay, looked at fuel regulator, sensors, etc..
4.	Turned out to be corrosions in DME and fire wall connections.
(they cleaned both with electrical cleaners and it has not failed yet)
5.	BTW: it ended up costing about $400 to find the problem, and 3 -
tows (I have AAA Plus)

	So I'm tooling around the Washington Beltway (I495) at 9:30am
this
	morning, take the 95N exit toward Baltimore and life is good.

	THEN my 87 944 NA just stops running!  I get it on the right
shoulder,
	stop, and sit - desperately trying to remember if I should try
to start
	it or not.  It's been 21K miles since the belt change,
everything's been
	normal, so I don't think I've lost the belt or the valves - so I
turn
	the key.  

	It turns over, sounds normal but won't start.  (whew I think??)

	On the cell phone, call AAA, and wait.  It occurs to me that
I've been
	paying AAA for 10 years and two 944's and this is the first time
I've
	ever had to call them.  90 minutes later the car's on the truck
on the
	way to my (good shop)dealer while I get the tour of the
International
	tow truck with Jerr Dan bed - tow truck (around $58K if you're
	interested)

	After the $180 (thanks AAA) tow truck ride the Service Advisor
(who also
	owns a 944) asks me what the guages did when it stopped running.
I
	honestly can't remember (I was a bit busy trying not to become
engaged
	to the 18 wheeler behind me) but apparently it makes a
difference
	whether they went directly to zero or wound down as the car
slowed.??.

	Anyway,  called them at 5:00pm this afternoon, the car was in
the shop
	and "the technician is standing in front of it with a manual in
his
	hands.  We'll call you tomorrow".

	I'd really like to get some sleep tonight - can anyone help with
this
	mystery??
