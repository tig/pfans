Graham,

These are all the things that got replaced on my 89S2  trying to eliminate
a vibration problem:
1. Clutch - the rubber core separates.  Have new one now.   Problem still
there.
2. Front shocks.  Mechanic thought this would eliminate steering vibration.
 No, it did not.  New shocks.
3. Motor mounts.  New ones.  Still vibrates. However, since I learned these
resonate at low RPM.  Perhaps your case.
4. New tires (and balance of course).  Thought this might be it.  Nope.
5. Timing of balance shaft, in case the belt skipped a tooth or so. 
Checked OK.  The orientation of the pulley was checked, which can be
accidentally rotated 180 degrees.  You should have this & motor mounts
checked first.
6. Clutch taken appart again.  Flywheel re-balanced.  This did not cure it
either.

At this point the car resonates at about 2700rpm worst, higher than yours. 
The interesting thing is that it does it when standing still, just by
reving up the
engine, with the clutch either depressed or not, whether or not it is in
gear.  So this rules out transmission, and points to the engine.  There are
two expensive things that remain to be checked and possibly replaced:
a) A vibration dampener, a $450 pulley which I am told is not too big but
heavy, with some rubber core.  They "rearely ever" fail, but in my case
this may be the problem, since it would not be "isolating" engine
vibrations.
b) A failed balance shaft.  This is also very, very rare.  And expensive to
replace.

My car is very driveable, but whenever the engine passes the 2500 to
2900rpm range in any gear, the gear shift vibrates, and the vibration
transmits to the
car.  Several Porsche specialists and a very reputable MA dealer tell me to
leave it the way
it is, stating that it is within the "normal" range.  I have not decided
yet what my next step will be.

I would also appreciate any input on how to easily identify whether the
"vibration dampener" or "balance shaft" can be causing my problem, and
possibly yours.

In short, I suggest that you first isolate the problem to either engine or
drive-train.  Then work from there.  Hope the above helps you.

Regards,

Eduardo
