Both cars are balanced packages, with not only engines, but brakes,
suspensions, wheels, etc., that are part of a whole car designed to do
a certain thing.    Jump the horsepower, and you had better consider
increasing the brakes, spring rates, etc.    Other than the engine displacement,
little else is even similar between the two engines, meaning that you 
would be in a whole lot of time, effort, MONEY, etc., cobbling up a 
car that really isn't ready for what you want it to do.    An 83 in incredible
condition is still worth less than $5000.    You WILL spend WAY more 
than this modifying it in the direction of being a safe, functional, effective
turbo.   

In addition, 944s are not technically unsophisticated cars, so the probability
of a costly, dangerous mistake is fairly high, and I don't care how smart or
experienced you are.   

If a customer came to me and requested that I do such a conversion for him,
I would tell him to bring ALL his money, let me have the car for six months
minimum, and I would test ALL of my knowledge getting the job done.   

ANYthing is possible, but not necessarily cost effective, safe, or smart.

The above said, MY recommendation is to save yourself all sorts of 
headaches and enjoy the 83 for what it is while waiting for your insurance
rates to come down (at age 25?), or sell the 83 and buy a 951 outright.
