In your letter you asked for suggestions on replacing the hood-linliner and
timing belt., Well Gerald as for the hood-foam as you called, a good
wet/dry-vac will be good to remove most of it after you cover the engine
and adyacent areas with a big blanquet. Then you may purchase a
Thermo-Accoustic hood liner from Performance under $100.00 which will
work just fine and can be easily installed with a peel & stick process.
As for the timing belt project, I assume that your decision is based on
accumulated mileage., Well as we all know this is not a 1/2-hour process
so if you are going to go for it do a complete job. Porsche four-cycle
engines go through the intake, compression, ignition and exhaust process
real fast, seven or eight times a second at idle and even fifty times a
second at 6000/rpm., Needless to say, timing and spacing are extremely
important for this very coordinated function to be succesful. Important as
well are the connections, the camshaft has to turn exactly half the speed
of the crankshaft for everything to happen when it's supposed to and the 
coordinated success depends on the timing belt, it is not necessary to
mention
what happens when the valves collide with the pistons (been there).
Everytime
I replace the timing belt and counterpart, the water pump is replaced as
well.
Then again we all know that this is not one of Porche's best things and
thats
probably why they've designed more than ten different ones, if I am not
mistaken
probably the best ones could be 944.106.021.22R for NA's and
944.106.021.08R for T's.
Like I told before I've always changed timing & w/pump (regardless of
condition),
but used mileage as reference for the drive and tensioning sprockets until
one
day one the demonic things broke apart and may imagine the rest. Then there
is
the tensioning issue and so on and we would probably spend hours on the
subject.
MY ADVICE: If you are going to spend some bucks and open the thing, go all
the way
and replace timing and balance shaft belt, water pump, drive and tensioning
sprockets.
You may accomplish all this with a few more Franklings and be somehow ahead
in
the game of down-time which we all Porschenuts hate!   Good luck buddy...
