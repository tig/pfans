Hi All,

My wife and I jumped in the 944 and headed from Sonoma County (Northern
California wine country) down Highway 1 to Monterey and Carmel.  The road is
great for driving (beautiful scenery and enough twisties to have fun) and the
weather was perfect . . . . . wow, it couldn't have been better.  We spent
three wonderful days around the bay seeing the sights and checking out the
shops.

Well, the trip back was just as great until I pulled in the garage and shut
off the engine . . . . . the center fan (the one nearest the passenger side
of the car) wouldn't shut off and it sounded like a wind tunnel in there.  I
thought it would go off when the car cooled off but three hours later it was
still sounding like an F-15 on full afterburner!  Finally I just pulled the
connection at the fan to get it to stop.  The next day I plugged the
connection back in and the fan started up again.

I know it's probably the thermoswitch but can someone please tell me where,
specifically, the thermoswitch that controls this fan is located?  I tried to
trace the wires but I got lost and it's kinda dark in there.  I would greatly
appreciate any information on checking and replacing this item.  Also, are
there any other things I have to worry about while doing this?  Other things
I have to remove first?  Will I have to bleed the cooling system?  Etc.?

TIA,
