All,

I replaced the front swaybar bushings on my '86 951 about 9 months ago or so.
 Can't say for sure, 'cause I'm not at home.  The bushings under the "nasty
area" are already starting to go to s&!% again because I had to replace them
w/ the stock rubber ones ($90 for the full set of 4 !!!!!!) because nobody
made any out of another compound.  Screw new rubber ones.  This time I'm
going to purchase the raw material, bring in the old pair from the drivers
side, and have a new set machined.  Now to my question:

What is the best material to make swaybar bushings out of?  (Yea, I know
steel bearings!)  I figure my options are Delrine (no clue where to get it)
or Teflon (I actually used to have a big chunk of it when I was in college.
 Leftover scrap from the Physics Machine Shop.  Man, I wish I still worked
there!!!  Any ideas????

Bob
'86 951
blk/blk

PS:  I don't want to put bigger sway bars on.  I'ld rather use that money
towards my  Quaife.
