In answer to Todd's questions about Idle stabilizers, fuel rail stuff, etc
To: 924-944@porschefans.com

>>  I have seen talk of rebuilding the "idle stabilizer control" mentioned. I

think I want to try going there. Someone said it is located under the intake 
manifiold. Some questions:<<

Forget on "rebuilding" the Idle stabilizer or removing it without taking the
intake manifold off. Your problem sounds like something else anyway. The I.S.
just bumps the idle speed at cold start and regulates the idle when you turn
on the A/C, or any other accesories that would drop the idle.  A bad I.S.
will cause the idle to "hunt", or the car might have trouble returning to
idle when you lift off the throttle. If you have these symptoms, you can
remove it and waste a can of carb cleaner trying to flush the carbon,
varnish, etc out of the unit  It works sometimes.       

>>PS- Someone mentioned the fuel pressure regulator (single) on the fuel rail

near the fire wall as a possible target for my problem. I see two such 
devices on the fuel rail. One in front, one in back. Removing the vaccum 
hoses when the car is idling does'nt seem to change anything. There is 
vaccum present on the little hoses, but I don't know what to think about 
their operational condition. Any ideas?? <<

You have located the fuel pressure regulator (the one in the rear) and the
fuel dampner (front). A bad fuel pressure regulator MIGHT be causing the hard
starting. The only way to test it is with a fuel pressure gauge. 

The gauge is not a standard gauge like you might find at the local auto parts
retailer. Your gonna have to dig to find it. You might consider a local shop
if you don't want invest in the gauge and don't feel comfortable working on
the fuel system. The standard pressure should be around 2.3 bar (around 38-45
psi) with the DME jumped, engine off. It should hold that pressure for at
least 30min.

You can try pulling the fuel pump fuse the next time the car just cranks when
cold, as I have seen a few failed fuel pressure regulators that allow the
cold fuel pressure to reach 100 psi (a good reason NOT to use spring clamps
on fuel lines), which floods the engine. If that starts the car and it runs
and dies, my money is on a regulator.

Happy hunting,
