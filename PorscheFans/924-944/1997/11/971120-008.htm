Hi List;

Just came back from a two hour drive and noticed small wisps of oil
smoke - it appears that oil is dripping (about 1 drop/minute - just an
observation, not a measurement :-) on the exhaust manifold under the #4
cylinder flange (near where the #1 & #4 are joined at the Y).  The
location leads me to believe that it is seeping through the cam cover
gasket (?).

I rebuilt the head about 1 month ago (gasket/valves/guides - fun), I
installed all new gaskets (head cam cover, etc.) but did not use RTV
(was there from the previous PO) when I did the reassembly.  I also just
re-torqued the cam-cover bolts just to check that they are OK - but
still the slow drip.

Any thoughts about using RTV in this area? Anyone else had similar
experiences, or suggestions on where else the drip could be coming from?

Thanks in advance... 

John Dunkle
