>Are there any general extra tips to the process.=A0 I have read the FAQ =
and
checked the manual and it all seems straightforward.=A0 But that was how =
the
Motor Mounts seemed, so I figure there are a few "hints."=A0 What exactly=
 is
the correct swapping setup -=A0 same side, same axle rotation, opposite c=
v
rotation? Any help is appreciated.
<

Hint #1:  Take a stone or fine file and mark the outer race, cage and inn=
er
race with line up marks before pulling the CVs apart. If you do not do
this, those long winter nights will be spent trying to put the little gem=
s
back together.  Inspect the races for dings.  Reverse the axles to place
the load on the other surface.  When you reassemble them, make sure they
fully deflect and do not bind when rotating on the axle.

Hint#2:  Surgical gloves and lots of rags.

Hint#3:  Make sure you check the bolts after you put some miles on them. =
 A
tell tail sign of loose bolts is grease being sprayed from the joint.
