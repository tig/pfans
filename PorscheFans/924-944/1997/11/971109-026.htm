I haven't dropped a transmission before, but the Haynes manual seems pretty
complete on this operation.  Was wondering if there's anything to watch out
for during this procedure that might not be obvious.  Or to put it another
way, what's the easiest way(s) to screw it up?

TIA.

Nick:  As a veteran of several of these exercises, I can tell you that the
Haynes manual is fine for this task .  A few suggestions: use the proper
"cheesehead" wrench for the CV bolts.  A plain allen wrench will strip them
(ask me how I know!)  Also be careful when undoing the allen head bolt on the
coupler that connects the splined driveshaft with the transmission shaft.
 Make sure you have the wrench well seated.  Also, be gentle when you slide
the coupler once it's loosened; mine was pretty tight on the splines and you
don't want to bugger them up.  Finally, that transaxle is surprisingly heavy,
so have a friend handy.  I'm real interested in putting a Quaife in my next
944 (I'm shopping for an S2), so please let the list know how this turns out.

On the issue of gas tank fumes, my 1985.5 nearly drove me insane.  I removed
the tank, which was plastic, replaced all of the fabric covered vent lines,
the two-inch flexible filler line, and everything else I could think of.  I
also resealed the armored cover that covers the fuel filler where it passes
through the interior, first covering it with sheet plastic several mills
thick and then liberally coating the faying surfaces with RTV black. I also
replaced the sound deadener in the tank area, which had become saturated.  I
swear I still smelled faint gas fumes (not to mention RTV!) even after all
that was done.  Eventually, though, it went away.  The guy who bought the car
never mentioned a smell, so I guess all this worked.
