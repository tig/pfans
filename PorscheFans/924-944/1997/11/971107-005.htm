I used the following method to "calibrate" my speedo.  

You may notice that when Car & Driver or Road & Track evaluate a new car,
they usually do a speedo calibration.  They will tell you the "shown" speed
and the "actual" speed.  Well for my '96 Accord EX, the speedo is exact.
Actual and shown speed are the same.  

So I had my buddy drive my Accord up the highway and told him to set the
cruise on 60, 70, 80, and 90 mph.  We used cell phones to communicate.  The
only reason I did this is because traffic in Atlanta averages 75mph in
65mph zones.  When I first got my car in March, my buddy and I were going
slightly faster than traffic and the speedo said 95 and I knew we weren't
going that fast.

Results for my 85.5 844 - speedo approx. reads 4mph fast.  

Btw - I know the list has had several threads on police officers.  I was
going north on I75 3 weeks ago doing 89 in 55.  I looked over, saw the
state trooper, he turned on his lights so I just pulled over and waited for
him.  Before he could say anything I told him I noticed I was going way too
fast when I saw him.  He only gave me a warning!  After he checked my
license (which i didn't have with me, duh), he gave me a warning citation
for not having my license with me, told me to slow down and have a nice
day.  See, all cops aren't pricks.  It was probably refreshing for him not
to pull someone over acting stupid as to why they were being stopped. 

Regards,

Michael Belfoure
