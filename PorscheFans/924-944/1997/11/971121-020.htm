Like many others, I had the cooling fan problem recently. Since I didn't
notice until it was too late, the fan drained my battery completely (not
even the clock was on). A friendly neighbour (911 owner who had experienced
fan problems too) was nice enough to give me a jump with some MONSTER jumper
cables that could really pull some juice. After the jump, my radio freaked
out. When I turn it on, all lights come on, the volume is at max, and none
of the controls work. You can't even turn it off by pushing the power button
and turning the ignition off (even pulling the key) won't stop it either.
Only way to kill it is to re-start the engine - this, I guess, cuts all
power for a brief moment.

My question is, could this really have been caused by the jump, or did my
radio just decide to go bad? The unit is a Blaupunkt Laguna CD player.

By the way, does anyone have advice as to where to place an amp? I'm
thinking I may juice up the system a little if I have to replace the radio
anyway.

Thanks,
