All, 
I have to replace my upper strut mounts, so I was planning on going ahead an
having my Koni Yellows modified into coilovers w/ camber camberplates.  A
neat idea popped into my head.  I've heard of bilstein coilovers for the 951.
 I could probably SAVE money by getting the bilsteins, and selling the
Koni's.  I would have gotten bilsteins when I upgraded the shocks and struts,
but the don't make stock replacements, and I was pretty green at that time,
and hadent even heard of a coilover conversion.

Anyway, has anyone done this?  Does anyone know how much of a change I would
experience from switching to bilstien from Koni??  The primary reason I want
bilsteins (yea, I know I keep switching the E and I arround!) is that I've
heard they don't fade, ever.  Plus, the only time I use the adjustablility of
the Koni's is at Drivers ed, and I put it on full hard.  When I do this, I'm
always torn between whether or not I shoud, because I'm basically setting the
car up to push more on the track!.

Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated.
