Vaughn,
Just a guess here, but it sounds like your main fuel pump may be on its last
leg. I recently went through those exact symptoms in my volvo, which has a
bosch fuel pump, and I was able to get it to cough to life intermittently by
banging on it with wrench, but ultimately had to replace it. If it is working
you should be able to hear it. In order to do this with the engine off, I had
to find the relay, pry off the cover, and gently jam the contacts together,
which will make it run if the ingnition is on (at least on the volvo) You can
also use this test to see if it is pumping fuel by disconnecting it and
running an outlet hose into a container, but be careful, fuel and electrical
things under cars are a dangerous combo. There may also be a seperate tank
pump, unless the pressure pump is in the tank on this car. (Not sure) Other
fuel related possibilities:
-totally clogged filter (not likely)
-vapor lock, typically due to air entering fuel line before pump due to
crack/bad connection - symptom is slightlyt louder than normal pump noise, as
it has air in it. 
-tank vent clogged (causing vacuum in tank) - symptom is heavy vacuum when
removing filler cap.

It sounds like you are on the ball enough to have checked the spark, if not,
do that.
If spark is bad, check rotor, wires, etc. 

Good luck
