I have a few questions that may have been answered before, but I am fairly
new to the list so I have missed any advice that may have been given.  I
own a 83 944 with a nasty knock in the front right "shocks?"  Sitting in
the drivers seat I can barely hear the knocking.  But recently I sat in
the passenger seat (never been there before) and the knocking was right
under my feet.  The knocking happens when ever I go over the curb at the
end of the drive way, and sometimes on low speed bumps.  I think that it
is some where in the shocks, linkage, or even maybe the wheel bearings.
Has anyone had this problem and what was your solution.  It will just save
me some searching around under the car time.

Also transmission or clutch has been making horrible knocking sounds when
I let off the clutch in gear.  I can get the knocking to stop if I let off
the clutch very slowly (eating my clutch) but when I let off the clutch at
a normal speed there is a knocking sound as it engages.  Am I looking at
worn clutch bearings or something in the transmission?  P.S. I got this
car from a private owner who put the clutch in himself a year ago.  Maybe
he didn't replace all the bearings with the new clutch?

Thankyou in advance
