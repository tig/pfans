Hi Matt

I believe Doug Donsbach answered your question better than I could have.
I haven't corner balanced my car yet but I know the dealer lowered the
ride height to European & ROW spec when he found out I was going to
autocross the car.  If you find someone in your area with scales, you
can properly corner balance the car.  Make sure the scales are level on
the the ground or your readings will be off and do the weighing with the
driver in the car if possible and setup the car in race trim if that is
what you plan to do with it.  The idea is that the sum of the LF and RR
weights is the same as the sum of the RF and LR weights.

Alex
