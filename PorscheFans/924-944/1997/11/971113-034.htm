Come on, folks. Could we chill out a little on this turbo debate? There are
ways of disagreeing w/out backing someone into a corner w/ no graceful way
out.  Also better ways of reaching a consensus on the facts, which I would
assume is all we're interested really interested in.  I suppose we could
all polarize the situation more by taking a vote on who's the most correct,
but that's not the PorscheFan way.  Hell -- I don't know jack about the 951
system, so this is the only way I can get into the conversation.  I did try
drilling the cycle valve on my S2, but nothing happened. At least I think
it was the cycle valve.
