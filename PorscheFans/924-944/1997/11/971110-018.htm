Hello Tom,

The brake pad sensors are NOT part of the brake pad. The sensor is a 
separate part. The factory pads have a cut out that the sensor fits into.

When you remove the pads, assuming the sensor is not worn out, you remove
the sensor, and install it in the new pads. If you need new sensors,
those are available at the dealer for like $20 each.

Personally, I don't like the factory pads. They create too much dust,
and cost too much money. For street, autocross, and light track use,
I like MetalMasters. Those are available from Imparts, and many many
other places for like $30 / axle.

The deal is that the dealer STILL has outrageous prices on some items.
