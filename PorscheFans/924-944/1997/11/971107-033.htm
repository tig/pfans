Hi fellow Powners. 
Having found a slight oil leak on the bottom joint on the oil return
line on my 82 spec 924 Turbo (The collector with the two bolts at the
bottom of the turbo). I decided to replace the gasket or the O ring
which ever was attached to the mating surfaces (even Porsche were not
very convincing to which it should be).
The job started by undoing the sump connection first which meant
draining the oil from the engine, then undoing the two bolts I thought
thats it but no !, there is a breather pipe from the rocker box cover
which attaches to the return oil line under the exhaust manifold via a
small manifold, this is then bolted to the Turbo. Having disconnect this
and removimg several other pipes and brackets, I have come to the
conclusion that when the car was built, this return pipe was the very
first part fitted to the car, and in order to remove it because of lack
of space, I think the engine will need to come out ?. I Know that
originally the return pipe was modified to stop it from blocking up, but
because there are now so many brazed up joints on it the task of
removing it looks almost impossible.
Anybody with any experience of this job, or knows a part time Magician
could you please reply.

PS I am waiting with baited breath, with a 13 mm spanner in one hand and
a Hacksaw in the other just in case.
