Hi Jim,

I can definitely recommend my mechanic - Mark Tashjian. He owns Formula
Motorsports in Long Island City. He has 32 years experience and an ME
degree, He is past President of MNY PCA and is the caretaker of the
fastest PCA club racer in the country. You probably couldn't ask for a
better person for track support outside of the factory. He will already
be at every nearby PCA club race attending to Nick Ventura's Batmobile,
as well as codriving it at local drivers ed events. It is great having
your mechanic at the track to attend to the niggling problems that would
otherwise ruin your weekend.

He does all the work on my '89 951 that I use as a street/track car.

Tell him I sent you.

Paul Foster
