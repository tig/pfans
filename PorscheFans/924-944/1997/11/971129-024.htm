Well, I used Valma Motorcleaner. I wordked on my stabilizer. BTW some
say th IS can be cleaned without removing the intake manifold. It's wrth
the try, saves you a lot of time when it works out.
I prefere to take the IS out and clean it good. I mean the way I can see
with my own eyes that it's clean. I managed not only to clean the valve
part, but Ialso cleaned the 'motor'-part of the IS. The collector of the
rotor was very dirty. I think the feed-back to the DME was gone (once in
a while). When there is no feedback to the DME, the valve will be shut
closed (checked this myself). 
You can check this by connecting the IS and turn the key on 'contact'
(dashlights on).
If the IS is 'buzzing' it's ok. If it's not buzzing it is probably stuck
closed (small chance it's open all the way).
It is very tricky to open the IS though. If you're not sure, leave it
and buy a new one. Saves you a lot of grey hair. :-)

Yes, it is. That is, if your car is the newer typ. The older ones (old
dashes) I don't know for sure. It is even marked as DME relay. I am not
near the car right now, but I thought it was a common VW/Audi relay.
(number starting with 111 ?) Check the relay for cracked soldering
joints. They are very common, but difficult to spot without a magnifier
glass.

For the bad idle: did you check the mixture? When to lean or to rich
this can mess up a lot.

Good luck!
