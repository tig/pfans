Sorry about the repost. Im a first time Porsche owner and in my earlier post
I may have called some components the wrong name.
What Im trying to find out about is the DME relay. I know that part is
right. I took the cover off of the relay itself and had a friend turn the
key on while I watched the relay. The contacts inside do absolutely nothing
no matter what postion the key is in. (off, on or starting).
Does anyone have an answer for this? I have had several responses saying its
the DME and another saying its the ECU.
Ok, the silver box that is right above my hatch release and hood release on
the driver side kick panel, what is that?

Im pretty sure that since the DME relay is not doing anything that I am
almost on top of finding the problem after months of useless labor cost.
Since the relay is not doing anything does this mean that the relay itself
is bad of is there another part called a DME that is bad and this is the
reason the relay is not working.

I know that it can probably be several things but at least I have a starting
point to work at.
Im trying to find out all of this info because I will be driving to get a
DME relay to see if that fixes the problem. If anyone thinks I should get
something else I would like to know.
