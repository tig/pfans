It sounds to me that the computer chip is the cause for the increased boost.
I've heard several people state that the chips alone raised the boost level.

That raises the question as to what exactly the bolt does.  Even some of the
information on this list I think is in error as it was stated last week that
a bleeder between the bolt and the cycle valve would raise the boost with
some knock protection.

If you bleed off boost pressure before the cycle valve, at first the
computer will increase the duty cycle on the valve trying to maintain the
computer boost level (remember it sees the boost level off a second line
near the back of the manifold)

If you continue to drop the pressure the cycle valve will in effect be in
the full low boost extreme.  If knock occurs the computer will reduce the
timing but is already in the lowest boost setting it can command..... No
real detonation protection!

To me I still prefer the screw in the back of a mechanical wastegate....but
if you go with a computer controlled WG it seems to me that the computer and
the factory cycle valve (factory pieces or otherwise) is the way to go.  Now
as to why there is need for a bolt or the shim when the computer can cut off
the pressure required to open the WG to me remains a mystery.

If I'm missing something here let me know!  I'm just not sure the answers
are as simple as some here have made them out to be!
(NO flames intended!)
