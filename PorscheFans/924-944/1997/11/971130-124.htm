Porsche specifies the engine to be at room temperature.

>Just to add more to the belt tension thread, I was just looking at today's
>928 list, and noticed that the later 928's use an oil temperature sensative
>bimetalic device to adjust belt tension with engine heat, as apparently, the
>aluminum block expands enough when hot to effect tension on those cars, and
>this must be compensated for. Since the 944 uses the same materials, it would
>seem that at the very least it might make a big difference at what
>temperature the engine is when you set the tension, ie warm or cold. (not
>likely that you are going to get things apart enough while it is in the hot
>state) I assume it should be set engine cold, but I will look in the manual.
>If not, as then engine cools and shrinks a bit, the tension will drop. Does
>anyone know if its possible to retrofit the wider 944S belts and rolers to an
>8 valve engine? Seems like it would provide some extra insurance, and I'm
>planning a belt and roller replacement anyway.
