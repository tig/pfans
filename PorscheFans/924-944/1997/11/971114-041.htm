Porsche are great daily drivers. People actually drive these cars hundreds
of thousands of miles, unlike Ferrari's, NSX's, Lotus's. They are no more
maintenance intensive than any 10 year-old German car. I had a couple of
951's that I put 30K miles/year on. However you must do your maintenance by
the book to avoid big problems, which meant mechanic, oil change, checkup,
and Enterprise Rent-A-Car once a month for me. Not a big deal. Any other
maintenance that needed to be done like belts, hoses, brakes, etc. was done
then.

My current vehicle, a Range Rover leased new, is maintained the same way,
BTW. The car that I had previously, a 1979 RX-7, required far more
attention (points wear out fast and need constant addjustment you know),
but parts and labor were much cheaper.
