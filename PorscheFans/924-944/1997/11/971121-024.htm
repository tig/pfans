Hi all,
	I'm back to consult with the experts.  Now that I've had all my 
clutch hydraulics replaced and the tranny fluid replaced I have two new 
conditions and I'd like to get some feedback.  Some of the info is probably 
extraneous but since I don't know what's happening, I'll add everything I 
can think of which occurs.

1) When I park the car, I put in the clutch, put the car in neutral, set the 
handbrake and let off the brake and then clutch to let the car settle on the 
emergency brake.  When I let out the clutch I hear a strange sound.  It 
sounds like there is something metal spinning.  The best way I can think to 
describe it is if a metal ring was placed around something like a driveshaft 
and then when both are spinning, you stop the driveshaft.  The metal ring 
would spin a few times, making the same sort of noise.  Any ideas.

2) I have a difficult time shifting when the engine/trans is cold.  Much 
more difficult than when warm.  It is consistent across all gears, but of 
course more apparent in lower gears.  Enough that I can feel a kickback 
when it slips into the lower gears.  I had the clutch hydraulics worked on 
twice so maybe it needs more bleeding.  Is the clutch difficult to bleed 
properly on these cars for a shop?  I also had a full 30k tuneup, maybe the 
trans fluid they changed to was too thick.  Note that cold here is 60F(5C)
