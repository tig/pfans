So, Bill

How many extra changes of clothes do you normally have on hand???????


And, I'll tell you something else, guys and gals - even 100mph can be
pretty scary if you happen to be in the passenger seat, and the student
you are instructing at Road America (or any other track) doesn't have
the confidence in his/her brakes yet, and you are sitting there with
your right foot about to go through the floorboard as you approach the
last brakemarker and you can hear yourself yelling "BRAKE  BRAKE 
HARDER  HARDER"!!!, and all you can do is brace yourself more for the
possibility of an "off-road" excursion.  Drivers behind the wheel
aren't the only ones who get "white-knuckle syndrome"


BTW, I <underline>always</underline> have an extra change of clothes
available at the track.  I may have to start packing a supply of
Valium, also.
