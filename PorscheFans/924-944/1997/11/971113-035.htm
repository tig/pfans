Subject: Oil cooler - last cry for help!

Hi All,

This is the last post on this subject, I promise.  I want to replace my oil
cooler seals before they go bad.  I already purchased the seals but I can't
see an easy way to remove the oil cooler and housing without some type of
engine disassembly.  Does anyone out there know the proper procedure for
this job.  My last 2 posts have yielded no responses. 

George, Kevin, Istook ???????

Thanks,

Dear Mike & P-Fans
	I would put the gasket on dry. I think VW/Porsche/Audi - all recommend not
to use any sealant on two machined surfaces. Now I have installed some gasket
s (like the water pump) with  a small amount of "Permatex Aviation
Assembly"sealant  applied to one side only (be kind to the next guy who goes
back in there!) of the gasket, just to hold the gasket in "place". Hope this
helps you out. 

				Good Luck, davidjalai@aol.com
