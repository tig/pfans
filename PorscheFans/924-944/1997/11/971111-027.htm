Dear All

The end of the passenger foot well (bulkhead or firewall)of my 85 944 contains 
a bank of relays. There are very few  944s around to compare with so can 
anyone confirm if there should be some sort of cover under the dash and 
covering the relays. It looks like there should be. I'm concerned about 
passengers sticking their feet into this area with the obvious results.

I have noticed that later 944s have plastic inner wheel arch guards to protect 
from mud etc. Down here in rural Dorset this is now a problem with the winter 
weather approaching. Does anyone know if the guards can be fitted to earlier 
models? I can see no reason why they shouldn't fit. 

My aerial is on the nearside of the car mounted on the wing(fender). It 
frequently clips hedges and overhanging bushes on the narrow lanes around 
here, particularly when pulling over to pass some oncoming agricultural driver 
in a 4 x 4 or similar. I have seen a 944 with a roof mounted 'bee sting' 
aerial as on a Golf 16V (UK market) which might be a solution. I'd appreciate 
any suggestions about this idea or alternatives. A 944 with a wonky aerial 
does not look cool.

TIA

Alyn
