        A buddy out here recently had his 924S hit hard by an uninsured
motorist (yes, welcome to the Aloha State, where an estimated 1/4 to 1/3 of
drivers do not carry manditory auto liability insurance). The car suffered
extensive damage to the driver's side door, front and rear fenders, and
minor frame bending.  A reputable body shop that works on P-cars says the
frame is easily correctable. My friend's insurance company, GEICO, has
offered him slightly more than 3K and wants to total the car.
        Does anyone (Bruce Anderson??) have very recent sale price data on
87 or 88 924S's? Loren's car had 130k on it and is in relatively good
shape.  Kelly and Edmund indicate 5k or more for the car; I think Bruce's
compilation in last April's Excellence had similar prices for
well-preserved cars.

Hope everyone has a nice meal of leftover Thanksgiving dinner goodies,
