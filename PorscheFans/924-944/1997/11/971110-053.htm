Neil, changing the radiator is really not all that difficult.  Probably the
hardest part is getting to the upper fan assembly bolts which require a
socket extension and 'feel' (they can't be seen).  Once you get the fan
assembly out, it is easy to loosen the hose clamps and unbolt the rad hold
downs.  After installing the new one and filling up be sure and bleed the
cooling system properly (very important).

On the subject of the Performance Products Copper/Brass radiator, I have
one of these installed in my car (an early 85 N/A).  I don't know if this
one also fits newer 944's but I can tell you it didn't fit the older 944
very well.  I had to make some mods to the sheet metal in the engine
compartment where the bottom of the rad sits and I also found that the rad
was a bit too wide to fit between the 'rails'.  I had to dent in the end
tanks a bit to get it in there without contacting the side rails.  It is
also a little thicker than the original rad so clearance between front of
engine and fan assy is reduced.  I would not recommend installation of this
one by an inexperienced mechanic.  It works fine as far as cooling goes and
at least it is repairable.  I kept cracking the end tank on the old
plastic/aluminum rads (went through 3 of them!).
