The results of removing the cat. may not be as positive as you would
think, at least for new NA cars.  In attempting to get more HP from my
'94 968 I had the car dyno tested with and without the cat. in place.
Initially, HP actually decreased without the cat.  By increasing fuel
delivery we were able to increase performance modestly (+/- 5 HP).  The
car is noticeably louder, I think probably because I have an open B&B
cat. back system on it.

My cat. did show some evidence of heat damage.  The car has only 2-3
hours of track time total but has been in very hot environments since
new.

If you decide to remove your cat. store it in a dry place with the ends
taped up.  I have been told that an open cat. will absorb water and
eventually be damaged by it.  Don't know if that is true but at the cost
of a new cat. its worth doing.
