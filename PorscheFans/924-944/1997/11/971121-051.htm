Dear Barry & P-Fans
	Let me try to explain how the 'EGR' effect allows you to run more ignition
advance. I went to my SAE Automotive Engineering Dictionary, and looked up
the EGR definition: " The mixing of exhaust gas with the intake air to
increase the specific heat of the charge and thus reduce the formation of
oxides of Nitrogen. EGR works as a temperature lowering measure is very
effective way of reducing the nitrogen-oxide content of the exhaust gas. The
exhaust gas reduces the combustion temperature as it is burned again. This in
turn diminishes the quantity of oxides of nitrogen, a harmful emission, that
is produced."

some pollutants.

	What is EGR and how does it work?  EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) is a
emissions device that routs exhaust gases back through the engine's intake
one more time to burn off the unburnt fuel/pollutants. The EGR System
reroutes the unburnt fuel under part throttle/little load conditions ie: at
part throttle from 1200-3000 rpm's. The EGR valve opens slowly or is pulsed
(% of duty cycle) electronically by the engine's ECU.  Some systems use a
electronic/ECU vacuum operated system and some are purely mechanical valve.
Not all cars have EGR, the 944 does not. Most cars for sale in the US since
1973 have EGR systems. 
	Failure modes with EGR System. The EGR valve will fail in either the open or
closed position. In the open position the engine will have a rough idle, and
little overall power, but will not ping. If the EGR valve fails in the closed
position, the engine will detonate or ping very loudly - even if the engine
has a knock sensor, the ECU will not be able to retard the ignition
sufficiently enough for the engine not to ping. Ever hear a old '70-'80's
pick-up truck (or Subaru for that matter) pinging on light acceleration? The
EGR Valve has failed in the closed position. 
	Why does the engine ping if the EGR valve fails in the closed position? As
we learned in the definition of EGR System - the exhaust gas cools the intake
gas charge inside of the cylinders - this allows the manufacture (or Chip
Maker) to increase or advance the ignition timing curve. With EGR, the engine
can tolerate more ignition than if the engine did not have EGR system. The
internal cylinder temperature runs cooler - allowing the spark plug to fire
sooner. 

>>How can changing the exhaust back pressure affect the amount of >exhaust
that get's run back through the engine? 

	The SAE Automotive Engineering Dictionary, definition of Exhaust Back
Pressure: " The resistance that impedes the flow of the exhaust gases from
the engine to the atmosphere, caused by the friction and other restricting
factors in the exhaust system".   
  	Due to the camshaft design, the exhaust valve stays open - for awhile -
while the intake valve is starting to open allowing air to fill the cylinder:
this is called "over lap". There is a certain amount of overlap designed into
system so that the 944/951 does not need an EGR valve. Changing the exhaust
back pressure will effect the amount of exhaust gas entering the cylinder. By
lowering the exhaust back pressure - and by installing that "free flow"
muffler, the incoming "charged air" will fill or move into the exhaust port
and out the muffler/tail pipe- And not into the cylinder as intended! Instead
of the "charged air" going into the cylinder - it will flow right out of the
exhaust valve/port, since there is some over lap designed into the cam
profile of the 944/951's. The result of which (freer flowing exhaust/lower
back pressure) is ignition detonation because of the diminished exhaust gases
present (and a higher cylinder temperature). This is also true for those
people who run more than 17 PSI of boost. The higher boost flow causes or
pushes the "charged air flow" in the intake valve and right out of the
exhaust port!  Most drivers do not noticed this happening, unless they drive
around with a "fuel air flow meter". I think that this is the real reason why
high boost 951's seem to blow the head gasket - detonation. Either due to
insufficient gas octane or diminished EGR - higher cylinder temp. You do
reach a level of boost where more boost is less Hp - I feel that this is
around 18 PSI. 
	Remember an engine is basically an air-pump. The engine has been "tuned" for
certain fixed or known variables, exhaust back pressure, camshaft specs,
engine displacement, CFM's the cylinder head can flow or move, fuel octane,
and many other variables.  

>>Finally, 944 turbo's have knock sensors. If detonation occurs, the ECU
is supposed to handle that by retarding ignition.

	The 951's do have knock sensors but they can only retard the ignition timing
so much. If you are inclined to install a exhaust system, chances are that
you also have a chip. After market computer chips are designed to use 93 or
higher octane gas (Porsche tunes for 87 worse case octane). They (chip
makers) are using a more radical ignition curve mapping. When you are running
more ignition advance the ECU can only reduce or retard the advance so much -
a chipped car will ping with low octane gas - even with knock sensors! One
other thing to remember is that when detonation occurs inside of the cylinder
- the human ear can not hear that spectrum. Only when the detonation gets
severe enough does the "ping become audible to the human ear. 

	I hope this clears up your confusion. If I am wrong -on any one of my points
- "feel free to set me straight".  
				
					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
	



	 

	Other elements that can effect EGR performance. 

Valve Timing: Camshaft overlap. Large valve overlap causes internal exhaust
gas recirculation. However this also increases hydrocarbon emissions and lead
to poor engine idle. The incoming air charge - will flow right out of the
exhaust valve before the intake valve closes - not filling up the cylinder
with a fresh charge. 
Compression Ratio: High compression is known to be a method of improving fuel
economy due to improved thermal efficiency. Increasing the peak combustion
temperature and increasing the NOx emissions.
Combustion Chamber Design: Compact combustion chamber design, position of the
spark plug, inlet swirl design all effect the 'burn" and emissions output.
Crankcase Blow-By: How much of the crank case gases go into the intake tract.
Via the piston rings or a failed component like a leaking oil cap or valve
cover gasket. 
Increasing the Turbo's Boost Pressure: Turbo boost level so high that the
"charge air" flow right out of the exhaust - and not filling the cylinder. 
Fuel Evaporation: storing gas tank fumes to to burned off at a latter time,
reducing the HC's.
