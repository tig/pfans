John,

I just went thru a cam cover leak repair this summer. Mine leaked right
behind the distributor, at the front outside corner.

It seems the gasket is prone to movement/leakage if it is not bone dry
upon installation, and the mating surfaces are not flat to each other.
In my case, my mechanic used a *little* silicone on both sides of the
gasket besides through cleaning. It is now 3.5 months later, and no
leaks. The car has also stopped running hotter, which got worse as the
leak got worse.

Funny thing is, in poring back over the PO's service records, this 944
developed an earlier overheating and oil leak condition about 5 years
ago -- solved by replacing the cam cover gasket.

Bottom line sounds like you have to tear the cam cover off again, and
replace the gasket.

Bill
