OK, P.C. if you're going to do this, here's some advice that others may
disagree w/ in part.  You've got a '90 2.5 L with - what? - 10.9:1
compression ratio?  The 951 has 8.0:1. Whether you turbocharge or
supercharge, you've got to reduce compression to between 8.0 and 9.5. This
means either shaving the pistons, replacing them with 951 pistons, or
getting a 951 engine.  

Opton 1 is to contact Supercharging of Knoxville (they advertise in
Excellence). If you assure them that the compression ratio is not over
9.5:1, and that your engine is in very good shape (i.e., minimal blow-by,
check your air filter box for oil accumulation and get a leak-down test),
then they will sell you a kit for about $3800 that you can install yourself
(it's actually kind of fun once you manage to squeeze all the ducting into
place). You should also get an oil cooler for the supercharger. Install
this and you will have between 200-250 hp, depending upon how well the
system is finally tuned.  You will be running a relatively high compression
ratio (9.5) at low boost (about 6-8 lbs). You should have a good 944
mechanic make sure that the increased fuel pressure is properly adjusted,
and the air/fuel mixture is correct - this should be done on a dyno because
you're dealing with changing mixtures under load, not just revving the
engine at idle.  I don't know whether Porsche put any knock sensors in your
'90 944, but if they're not present, you won't know when your engine is
"pinging" and running lean. With the supercharger, you will not be able to
hear it.  Assuming the engine bay layout of your '90 is like that on my
late '85, you shouldn't have problems with installation.  If this is done
properly, you'll have a fast 944 with no turbo lag, and plenty of low-end
torque.  

As long as you have to reduce compression, you could try talking w/ SC of
Knoxville about a system that would put out a higher boost with a lower
compression ratio.  Don't think they've done this a 944, but they might be
willing to play around with pulley sizes and fan configurations, and remap
their chip.

Option 2 is to buy a 951 engine, intake system, exhaust system, wiring
harness, DMEs and whatever else I've left out. The installation will be a
lot tougher than the supercharger.  I would guess that this costs about
$5-7K, not including installation.

Other options are to add parts of the 951 system to a '90 engine w/ reduced
compression.  I don't know where the 951 knock sensors are. If they're in
the head, then maybe changing heads would work, and you'd also have the 951
ceramic liners on the ports.  This hydrid approach is the most dangerous,
unless you follow in the path of someone who's already been thru it. 

Regarding the rest of the drivetrain, brakes, etc -- just treat the car
nicely and they'll probably hold up.

OK? Pick your path, get out pencil and paper, calculate the cost, and start
contacting 944 mechanics who know what they're doing.
