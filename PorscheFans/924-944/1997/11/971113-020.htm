With no offense to Farzaan or Steve, this topic is quite complex, and is more
apporpriate for a live discussion led by an absolute expert.  As I have
stated before, the best expert that I know is Jon Milledge.  He created the
prototypal Weltmeister chip kits, before the Greens changed over to Dinan as
a supplier.  He's also done some custom chips for a bunch of people that I
know.  Some of these are in one of my cars ('87 951 with all Turbo S parts,
plus some more aggressive stuff).  Remember that I also have an '89 951 with
the Autothority set-up.  Again I state: there is no comparison.  The Milledge
set-up in my car is much more fun to drive.

As for the available boost in gears 1 and 2, and its absolute limits, I will
go out in 1-2 hours and hammer it to see if I can develop full boost with the
Milledge chips.  Then with the Autothority chips in the '89.  I'll let you
know. (I do have an aux boost gauge for accuracy).

I have driven an '86 951 with a Milledge-built, Motec controlled motor.  It
is a street car.  It was faster than the 993 twin turbo which I have driven.
