Mitch,
I am in the process of replacing that damper ring on my 97 924S automatic
right now. It was my sister's car, and the cost of the repair decided her on
giving it to me if I wanted it. Here is the scoop:
The part is a rubber disc type affair which goes where the clutch would. You
can get one from Vertex (in Excellence Mag.) for just under 500.00, or from
Don McGill for about 550.00 ( a dealer that advertises in excellence) It is a
lot of labor to replace as the transmission needs to be dropped, and the
torque tube shifted back. Another secret about this job is that the rear
sensor which is in the top of the bell housing is easily bent by the flying
rubber debris, making its removal very hard, which makes removing the
bellhousing very hard. I fought tooth and nail to get the housing off, and
when it finally came out the sensor was mangled badly. Replacement - about
80.00. No other parts are required, but whoever is doing the work really
needs access to the factory manual for this. It is necessary to remove the
heater control valve to get at the last bellhousing bolt and some ground
connections. Also, the disc is unreinforced rubber, and showed considerable
evidence of drying out and cracking, which no doubt caused the failure, so do
not even think about getting a used one for cost/reliability reasons. Its a
shame they did not have a more bulletproof design for this, ie not rubber,
but what can you do? And you thought you would not have to pay for a clutch
job!  (which incidentally, the labor for this should not cost more than for a
clutch, as the parts are about the same. I have not got the part yet, but it
looks like the starter ring gear has to get transferred from the old part to
the new, so don't lose it. If you do not have access to the manual, let me
know and I could fax the relevant stuff to you. Good luck.
