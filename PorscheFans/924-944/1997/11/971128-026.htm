I had the same problem with mine over the last several months. On mine
it turned out to be a bad Throttle Position Switch (TPS). It would work
fine
on startup, warm up and stick, anywhere from 5 mins to 1/2 hour later.
Somewhere along the way, that ended up causing the DME/KLR to limiting
my boost to 1.2. Replaced the switch and have been happy every since.

That said, there are several things you might want to check. This isn't
a complete list, as I'm only a novice mechanic and a new 951 owner. I'm
sure others will jump in. First off, the system is very sensitive to
vacuum
leaks. You might want to check all the fittings, looking for loose or
cracked
couplings. One of the fittings may be slightly cracked, and expanding
with
heat. Another area to check is the connectors to the air-flow meter, the
TPS and the cycling value. Get some contact cleaner and clean those 
puppies. Also check the compressor bypass value. Make sure you cant
blow through it. 

That should keep you busy. Good Luck!
