Chris, you are correct, I was referring to the 85-88 non-S turbos and a
case could possibly be made that the comparison was not fair given the
217hp 951 was not offered when the S2 was. Still, would it not look bad
for Porsche and make 951 customers feel cheated if the 89 S2 had more
power and sold for less than the 88 (or even earlier) Turbo?  Similar
reasons might have killed the 951S.  Would Porsche really have allowed its
continued production when it decided it would not ax the 964 when the 951S
could outrun the 964 for less money and (subjectively) more style?

Given market dynamics, ie USD vs DM trade values, market trends, etc., it
is probably pointless to argue what really decided the cars' fates (968
and 928 also come to mind).  Enough bandwidth consumed from my end.
