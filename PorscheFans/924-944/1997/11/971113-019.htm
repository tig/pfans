It's easy to change rotors and pads on our cars ourselves. Got a great
deal on rotors & Perf. Friction. HP street pads from OG Racing in VA. They
advertise in Pano. For your car the parts should run $200 or less. Get a
second opinion and have the rotors thickness measured now, to see if you
can just have them machined to a clean fresh surface.

My rotors lasted 50K with lotsa auto-x racing.

If you have web access, go to Tireracks web site (www.tirerack.com) and
they have a program you can try different style rims on a side profile of
a 944 Turbo.

1/2" is'nt going to make a big difference, especially on the street. Even
for racing there is little difference.

May I ask your opinions of the 968 vs. the 944 Turbo? Which do you like
better? For daily driver or for track? TIA
