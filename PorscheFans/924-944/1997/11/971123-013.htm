It is my understanding that the Quaife is not technically legal in stock
classes.  IMO, many people use them as finding a factory unit can be tough.
 Personally, I don't think it provides a significant performance advantage
that would justify re-classification.

A non-stock turbo is definitely not allowed in your stock class.

>> legal in the Prepared class???  I really prefer them over the expensive
>> Recaro SRD and such...  So, what is legal?

I have an SRD in my '87 911 street/DE/Autocross car, and even as a Recaro
dealer choose to put a  Butler in my race car.  If you are going to street
drive your 951 at all, the SRD is the way to go.  For a strictly track car,
you'll love the added lateral support of the Butler/Kirkey style seats.

Joe Rothman- Recaro dealer.... blatant ad here:  Recaro has extra discount
until x-mas on their office chairs.  While I'm a racer, not a (good)
golfer,  my prices are well below "PAR"
'87 Carerra- mostly street car now
'85 944 race car w/factory limited slip and Butler seat
