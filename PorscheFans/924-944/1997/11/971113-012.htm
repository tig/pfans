Isn't this wrong? These cars had Audi engines, right? That's what the Auto
Atlanta catalog says, and that's what I have read everywhere else. A 375HP
turbocharged Audi engine.

Chassis number 924-006 was the 924 GTP Le Mans with the 410HP 2.5l
turbocharged 944 engine, and it is now in the Porsche museum. Also, I think
this was the car placed 7th in the 1981 Le Mans (not 924-005), and it had
only four gears.
