	This is odd, and I cannot find anyone who has this similar
problem, maybe the list will know.
	On the center console and glove box door of my 85.5 944 with the
grey/beige interior I am getting a very dark brown discoloration on those
pieces.  It starts as a small sumge ( looks like dirt) and grows
progessively.  I thought that since my baby is originally and AZ car that
it was sun damage showing up, but it is not on the door pannels or all
over the console, only in certin areas.  I thought that maybe it is the
cleaner that I am using, but I have used only STP and Armor-All, nothing
of which should discolor the plastic.  I have replaced all the bad
pannels, but I amjust hoping that it does not spread to the seats, door
etc..

	Anyone know what this is, or its cause, better yet, the cure??
	Could it be humidity??
