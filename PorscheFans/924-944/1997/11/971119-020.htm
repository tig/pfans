Why? There are two reasons:

1. The ball joints are worn. There are a few places that will press in new
ones - a place in Texas (name escapes me, but they advertise, and one of my
arms was done there) and Zimms (and probably others) - cost is $149-$179.

2. The arm itself is fatigued (usually at the anti-roll bar mount). Zyglow
will check this. If you are using the stock anti-roll bar, reasonable ride
heights, and relatively small amounts of negative camber, this seems
(*seems*) to be less of an issue (assuming regular inspection, of course,
but that goes for anything, including Fabcar, welded up steel arms, etc.).

Once you start modifying, sure, why not, its your money :-)

I assume you're talking about the upper strut mount. Everyone I've talked
to has said the same thing (and more) if one wants a competitive
front-running car in PCA stock classes. (I'm not saying they are right, but
it makes sense.) Unfortunately (or fortunately for my wallet) the classes I
run in other sanctioning bodies don't allow such items.

It is a fairly simple job to change these things. Worth re-quoting is the
following, which I assume is still the "official word." I'd appreciate
hearing any update. (Oh, the M030 bar mentioned is the 26.8mm x 4mm tubular
one - stock on your car, I believe.)
