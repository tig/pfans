Welcome to the fray... If you have a chance, read the FAQ

The belt tensioner on your car (as on all 944 cars from 1987 and newer) =
is
not an automatic tensioner (as in continually adjusting the tension).
Think of it as Porsche sending the tension tool out with each and every
engine.  You still should visit your local dealer for adjustments (also
keeping in mind that to adjust the timing on your 16 valve motor, you =
need
two dial indicators and a lot of patience.)

The belt should be replaced at 30K mile intervals, with a followup =
retension
at 1500 miles and 15000 miles.

> 3. If it does have the auto-tensioner, just how do you do it???
>=20

Set the engine to TDC on #1 cylinder. Backup the crankshaft 1.5 teeth.
Loosen (by a turn or two) the lock nut and the locking bolt on the =
tensioner. Let the tensioner do its job. Tighten the locknut and bolt.
Check the tension with a calibrated belt tension gauge P9201. Breathe
a sigh of relief on all the money you have saved by not bending valves
and breaking heads...

There is a very good shop in Tulsa, run by the PCA National Tech =
Committee
Chair for 944s.

Good Luck!
