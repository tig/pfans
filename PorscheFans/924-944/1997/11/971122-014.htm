James,
   Are you speaking of a split from the main 924-944 group? I think we are
better served by being a part of this group. We have a broader base of
knowledge of our cars in the group as a whole. Many of the changes made in
later years applies to our cars as well. We can learn from the experiences
of the Series II 944s. Just my $0.02.
