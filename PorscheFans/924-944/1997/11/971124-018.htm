Sounds like you're talking about your front struts here. From the factory,
the 944's already have a coil over setup. I guess you're talking about an
adjustable ride height setup. Both Bilstein and Koni have these units. The
Bilstein should probably be considered a race only setup for most people.
They are non-adjustable and pretty stiff, maybe too stiff for some folks.
How stiff is stiff is rather subjective. These units are made to use the
conical Turbo Cup spring although you can also set them up to run 2 1/2"
straight rate springs.

The Koni unit is double adjustable (compression and rebound) as well as
having the ride height adjustment feature. These units are the same as the
units originally on the Turbo S car except they have the added compression
adjustment. You can run these with the Turbo S spring or the Turbo Cup
Spring. I ran these units and the Turbo Cup springs at the Parade.

You shouldn't have a problem with fade with either of these units (much less
the ones you know have on the car). Fade used to be more of a problem when
inferior oils were used in shocks. Todays high quality oils make fade much
less likely even on hydraulic units.

Regarding your adjustments, remember, full stiff may not always be the way
to go. If a little bit is good.......
