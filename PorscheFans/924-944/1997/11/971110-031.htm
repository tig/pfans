	I just couldn't resist getting involved in the 944 top speed discussion. 
I think we have a lot of B.S. flying around!!!!
  From my memory I think a 951 is turning approx 2550 rpm at 100km/h (62
mph). Using this as a base we see that 6694 rpm would be 275km/h (169 mph).
The stock rev-limiter kicks in before this. This is also well beyond the
951's horsepower peak (6000 rpm). It is very unusual for a car to reach top
speed at an rpm higher than peak power.
  So, are all these people with the 170 mph +++ top speeds running chip
sets with increased rev-limits ,and running along at 6900-7300 rpm???? I
doubt it !!!!!!
   My '89 turbo S with Autothority stage 2, K&N ,and cat - bypass ran at
6600 rpm all the time ,but not much more.
Lets not forget that when these cars were new R&T and C&D tested them,and
got the to go between 158-162 mph. This is in the 6400-6600 range.
  I think a lot of people *wish* their 951's would go as fast as a 400hp
911tt but without a 2.8L and a k-27 there is NO WAY they will.

Good luck
Rob
