Ok, here is my problem...  I have only one of the two cooling fans running
at this time,

First some background on the circuit as I see it .. ..

 I have looked over the wiring diagram in the Haynes and notice that the
thermal switch is in direct line with the ground of one of the cooling
motors and in line with "the Cooling fan relay" coil ..This relay brings in
the second fan... the Battery plus comes from the two fuses(one for each
fan) through the relay to activate the fans. Now there is a fail safe
inplace if the relay should fail .. where a resistor is across the relay
that would energize the first fan motor ... 

Now what I see is apparently the first fan is operating but not as fast as
I would think, which would indicate that the cooling fan relay is not
energizing .. My problem is ... Where in the hell is this cooling fan
relay?? I can only assume it is under the dash somewhere .. but which one
... ????

Any help would be appreciated...


Thanks
Rich
