Rosaleen McCarthy is curious about pre-purchase checks.  So I say:

In September we compiled a list of Murphy's 944 Laws.  Here is an
applicable item:

*       An unwary owner may damage things, but to
        make a complete mess you need a Porsche dealer.

In all cars, but especially the Porsches, a good mechanic is a must.  It
seems like a dealer is not always the best equipped or skilled to check
out a car.  Here is St. Louis, MO USA, Plaza Motors, a Porsche dealer, had
a free clinic last spring during which they checked out my car
"bumper-to-bumper".  I guessed they meant it literally because they missed
the bad motor mounts and the somewhat ailing clutch.  The car had been
bought from the other St. Louis dealership, Parktown Porsche with those
problems right from the start, I discovered them along the way.  (the
jerks also never gave me the 1year warranty that the car qualified for) 
It was my fault, I had just joined the (old) list right before I bought
the car, I did not know better.  To be fair to the car, it gave me
limitless amounts of fun times, did not regret it a bit (it was an 87
944S).

To summarize my long story: Roz, or whoever else, find a good mechanic, do
not trust the name.
