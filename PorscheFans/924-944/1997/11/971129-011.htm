Just to add more to the belt tension thread, I was just looking at today's
928 list, and noticed that the later 928's use an oil temperature sensative
bimetalic device to adjust belt tension with engine heat, as apparently, the
aluminum block expands enough when hot to effect tension on those cars, and
this must be compensated for. Since the 944 uses the same materials, it would
seem that at the very least it might make a big difference at what
temperature the engine is when you set the tension, ie warm or cold. (not
likely that you are going to get things apart enough while it is in the hot
state) I assume it should be set engine cold, but I will look in the manual.
If not, as then engine cools and shrinks a bit, the tension will drop. Does
anyone know if its possible to retrofit the wider 944S belts and rolers to an
8 valve engine? Seems like it would provide some extra insurance, and I'm
planning a belt and roller replacement anyway.
