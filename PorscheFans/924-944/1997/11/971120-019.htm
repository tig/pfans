Barry,

I was read the GGR Time Trial rules, and it say that turbos are free in the
Production class (was I reading that right?!?).  Is this true in Club
Racing also?  If so, does this me we can run lightened versions from
Powerhaus?!?

I am new to this club racing thing, and the rules are hard to understand
completely.  All my co-workers are in the modified classes so they don't
help me much....

Also, has in been confirmed that a Quaife (Sp?) LSD will put you into
Production class in '98?  I heard rumors that choice of LSDs may be free in
'98.  My car doesn't have LSD, and after my last run at Sears Point, I
really want to get one.  The Quaife seems to be the obvious choice (bang
for the buck.)

We need more talk about racing out here!

TIA,
