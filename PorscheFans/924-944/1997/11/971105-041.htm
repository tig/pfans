Hi fans, I finally managed to get the damned driveline (torque) tube out of
my 924S automatic for a damper plate replacement. The flying rubber chunks
bent one of the electronic sensors, which refused to come out. I thought I
had it out far enough, but once I got the bellhousing clear another story was
told by what was left of it. I have heard that there is a need for something
to dampen vibrations from the crankshaft to prevent fatigue fractures, I
believe in the crank itself, and this is part of the reason for the little
springs in the clutch plate of manual cars, and also the rubber damper on the
automatic, (a similarity to the rubber centered clutch design on older
manuals, which I gather is obsolete) Do any of you advanced engineering types
know if this is true, and why all other cars with automatics don't seem to
need any of this, but simply have a ridid (tortionally)  flex plate to mount
the torque converter to the crank? It seems like there should be enough
tortional "give" in the driveline to make it work like a spring anyway. I
guess its not worth custom manufacturing a flex plate for this thing, though
at 475. vertex prices its close, but it would be nice not to have had to go
through so much for something so apparently unnecessary (the rubber is not
even reinforce in any way). Also, does anyone know if 928's with auto use
this same damper? It seems like there would have to something more to handle
300 hp and a heavy car. Just wondering.
