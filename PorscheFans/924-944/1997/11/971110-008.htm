How deep are the scratches?  It is possible if they are just in the clear
that buffing would take care of it.  Of course be careful not to burn
through the clear in the process.

Have you seen any work that this guy has done?  Just because he doesn't
work in big city doesn't mean he doesn't do good work.

If you do end up painting it, try to look at work that the guy has done
before you let him touch your car.  Good Luck.
