I own a turbo-converted '82 944, one of a series done by Callaway Cars here
in the US in the early '80s. Some conversion issues to consider:

A 944 Turbo engine cannot be "dropped" into a NA 944. The entire wiring
harness is different for a 951 vs a 944.

The stock compression ratio in a NA 944 is too high to allow any
significant boost from a "bolt-on" turbo installation. The stock pistons
and head must be machined to lower the compression ratio, and/or the stock
pistons must be replaced with factory Trubo pistons. Even if factory Turbo
pistons are used, the head may need to be machined.

If the stock block is to be used, the cylinders should be over-bored and
fitted with steel liners. This is a non-trivial job, requiring great
accuracy, and a "step-bore" to leave a ring of alloy material at the bottom
end to contain (with the head) the differntial thermal expansion of the
steel liner versus the alloy around it.

The transaxle will take the power, but you will need to treat the clutch
gently if you want any life out of it. Replacement with a competition
clutch may help.

The turbo installation should (dare I say MUST?) include an intercooler to
reduce the intake charge temperature. This will help reduce detonation, as
will a Carter Knock Eliminator. The Carter deveice is a "black box" which
senses the onset of detonation and dials back the ignition advance to
prevent it from damaging the engine. The alternative is that the #4
cylinder overheats, and eats its piston rings. This becomes expensive...

The intercooler inlet should be placed so that it has a forced air feed
path that won't be blocked by a nose bra or other "bug mask" device. If
that happens, the charge temp will overheat at speed, with expensive results.

A bigger radiator won't hurt, but the stock one will work for most US
driving. Extended autobahn running may be beyond its capacity, however.

Upgrade the brakes. Install at least a Cool-Brake kit (AJR Racing makes it)
and Cool Kevlar brake pads.

Given proper atttention to all of the above, you will find yourself
grinning uncontrollably as you hurtle through the 'wald. Maybe a season
pass to the Nurburgring is in order?

Gut fahren!
