When I posted the story about me racing the jerk in the 968, my point
was it was amusing that he thought his car was so much faster, that he
should be a jerk.

Now, who cares that the 968 is .5 seconds faster in the 0-60 mph dash. I
won the race because I know how to drive my car better.  He practicaly
stalled his.  It is smarter to debate which driver is better when
talking about two cars so evenly matched.
