Hi  p-fans!
  I don't remember if it was in theQ&A section of Excellence or (more
likely)Haynes Manual- Porsche 944 83 thru 89, but the top speed is listed as
130mph, auto or manual, with the auto lagging 1 second behind 0-60, and 1
second slower in the 1/4 mile.
I can't verify this tonight because my  manual is in my car up on my lift at
work, waiting for my new struts! One thing to keep in mind is that every
Porsche I've had experience with has had a very optomistic speedometer! My
stock euro -spec auto  1985.5 NA 944  has indicated a sustained top speed of
151mph and I know better!
 If you know a traffic cop with a radar or laser, try to get him to clock you
(unofficially!) at (indicated) 55 mph, 80 mph, and 100mph also. You'll be
surprised!
If any one knows how to calibrate the speedo, please post the precedure.
AlsoNorth Hollywood Speedometer & clock (818) 761-5136 will repair that
annoying odometer that stops reading although the speedo works for about 75
dollars. What usually happens is the odometer is slaved to the speedo by a
plastic shaft with teeth that break. If you have infinite patience you can
disasemble and repair by means of epoxy and careful filing your own teeth!
Accept no Substitutes doesn't mean don't be creative!
