I have an 87 951 which I have had since new. Now has 111,000 miles on it
and is going strong. Love the car & wouldn't think of getting rid of it
(except in exchange for a turbo-s).

But....and this is a big but for a freshman in college: this car is a
Porsche & when something goes wrong, it is expensive to fix. Read the
FAQ's. You will see that there are several typical things that go wrong
with 944's: water pumps, A-arms, sunroof mechanisms, motor mounts,
clutches, steering racks, clutch master cylinders and with the turbos, you
have to be careful of head gasket failure and failure of the #2 rod
bearings. My car has suffered all of the above except the rod bearing and
head gasket failures. Nevertheless, it is a great car, will run at full
boost on the track all day, stops on a dime, time after time and is very
fast. You won't regret driving it, but you might regret owning it.

Mike
