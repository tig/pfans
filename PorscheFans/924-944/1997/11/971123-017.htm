    Dunno, Chris... I'm a 914 guy, and I know next to nothing about
    the water-cooled cars.

    No.  The 951 makes more horsepower, so it has a higher top
    speed; it has more power to overcome aerodynamic drag.

    The relationship between horsepower and top speed isn't linear,
    though (the horsepower required to achieve any particular speed
    increases with the CUBE of the speed,so it takes eight times as
    much power to go twice as fast), so the 951 won't have a top
    speed all THAT much higher than the normally-aspirated 944.

    P.S.  Of course, this assumes that both cars are geared properly
          and that the 951's slightly-different bodywork doesn't
          generate enough extra drag to nullify the horsepower
          advantage.
