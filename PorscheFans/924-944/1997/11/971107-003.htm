DON'T drill the filler bolt out, you will get shavings in the transaxle.  I
can't remember what the plug is made of, but if it is totally stripped, I
personally would try two things - YMMV.  

Buy an 18mm allen wrench but buy the kind that uses a ratchet.  Then if the
plug metal is soft, you may be able to "tap" the allen driver in.  You may
have to use a dremel or die grinder to remove a bit of metal first.  If you
do, take your time and try to shape it similar to the allen head.

If the plug metal is hard, and if I remember correctly the plug sticks out
a bit, take a cold chisel, one that is maybe a tad dull, place it at the
edge of the plug and try to unscrew the plug by tapping it couterclockwise.
 Be very careful not to let the chisel dig into the transaxle housing.

Before trying any of this, call the Porsche dealer and ask the service
manager how much it will cost if you bring it in for them to get it out or
what they would try.  I'm sure this isn't the first time they've heard of
such a thing.

Good Luck and be careful!
