Ditto experience with George at Auto Atlanta. They expect you to have
PPNs at your fingertips and if you have their catalog (which is very
comprehensive) this is ok, but if you need their help pulling up a part
number or a price, good luck. What really struck me was that at the end
of a long list of parts, the guy just said "Ok we will send that out to
you" and hung up! I had to call back, stay on hold again, and talk to
this obnoxiously rude guy to find out what my total bill was and make
sure they had the right address. Wonder how they get any new business.
