According to my factory microfiche manual, both sprockets have notches in 
the rear flange of the sprocket.  As far as I can tell from the poor 
quality photo, for the lower balance shaft sprocket, the timing mark is on 
the rear cover, at the 7 o'clock position (assuming the engine is 
upright). The mark is adjacent to a 'boss' or some molded line in the 
cover I can't identify clearly in the photo.  For reference, the upper 
BS mark is just past the 12 o'clock position.

The factory manual also notes to have the color coded tooth of the belt 
facing _out_ upon installation.

When I loosened the tension on my belt to reduce the whine a few days ago,
I noted the shop had installed the belt with the color mark facing _in_. 
I wonder if this is causing the excessive whine at proper tension. 
(just realized this!!)
