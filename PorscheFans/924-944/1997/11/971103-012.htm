Hello,

I guess a lot of this depends on the particular dealer. There are
two dealers located fairly close to me. So last winter, when I needed
a CV boot, I made some calls:

Dealer #1. 'We don't have that in stock, we can get it for you in
  a few days. It's $79.00 + tax.

Dealer #2. 'We don't have it in stock, but we can get it for you 
  tomorrow. It's $72.00'

Imparts (one of my favorite mail order places. Too bad they don't
have that many porsche parts). We have it in stock. It's $19.00, and
you'll have it in two days.

The REAL funny thing is that when I went to an aftermarket place
for some exhaust gaskets (which the dealers didn't have in stock
but he did), the owner asked me if I needed a CV boot too. I was
kind of shocked that he knew, and he told me that one of the dealers
called HIM looking for the boot. He had it in stock, and it was
$21.00. So, dealer #2 would have bought it from him for $21, and
then sold it to me for $72!

FYI, the IMPARTS boot was a Lobro, just like the 'dealer' one.

Yeah, but sales tax usually cancels out the shipping. Given the
same (or even close) price, I would buy at the dealer just for
convenience, and because they sponsor some of my regions events.
However, dealing with their parts departments is for the most part
a nightmare. Either they don't have the part in stock, or it's
ridiculously expensive. 

Over the winter, I plan on changing the timing and balance belts,
and changing some leaky oil seals. I'll call the dealer, but I
don't have much hope.
