     Twice this past week my '87 944 died on me.  All those lovely red 
     lights on the dash awakened from their slumber (oh how I love that 
     exclamation point) and there I sat..dumbfounded.  As soon as I 
     attempted to re-start the car everything was fine.  Both times I had 
     only been driving less than five minutes after it's first start of the 
     day. I know the manual says run to the dealer to see what's wrong but 
     I was hoping there might be some possible guesses I could go in there 
     with. Any help/stories would be appreciated.  HAYDEN
