Hi everyone.  I have an 1988 944 .  I have had it now 1.5 years and love the
car.  Just Friday I started the car in cold weather and went back in so the
ice could melt off the windshield.  I heard belts squeaking and ran back out
and turned the engine off.  I popped the hood and the crankshaft pulley wheel
had come off.  Could the bolt holding this just fall out?  What is involved
in putting this back together.  Will this cost me an arm and a leg ?  Has
this happened to anyone else.  The water pump was replaced before I bought
the car and I just put in a clutch master cylinder a few months ago.  I would
appreciate any comments.  Thanks  
.
