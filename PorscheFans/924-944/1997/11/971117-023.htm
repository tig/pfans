Subject: torque tube noise

PFans,

Some advice if you can please: My 1990 S2 with 80,000 miles makes
quite a bit of noise at idle which my mechanic says is typical torque tube
noise. The noise goes away to almost nothing when the clutch is depressed.
As a side note -I feel quite a bit more vibration at idle with the AC on
than without, is this normal? I recently test drove a 1988 Turbo S withe
43000 miles which had hardly any noise at idle (there was some which
completely disappeared with the clutch depressed). The question here is
would it be a waste of time and money to try to reduce this noise to lower
levels. I'm only beginning to be more aware of the noise as the weather is
getting cooler here in Florida and I am able to drive with the windows down
and no AC. TIA.

Dear David
	If the noise is coming from the torque tube - you have a bad bearing!  If
the rattling bearing sound coming from the trans (rear of the car)  is normal
944 noise!  
	I have seen where someone had their clutch replaced - and the torque tube
was under too much preload - where the tube was not fully pushed in far
enough, and that caused the torque tube bearings to fail! 
	I would  highly recomend using Swepco trans fluid, I just changed my fluid.
The Swepco fluid got rid of the normal rattling noises from the trans for me.
I have used the mega buck Porsche fluid G-50 @$35 liter, also Mobil-1 gear
fluid, and conventional fluid. All these made that rattling noise that goes
away when you push in the clutch. Try the Swepco! 
				Good Luck, David Jalai
