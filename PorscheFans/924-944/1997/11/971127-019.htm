Hello P-Fans
	When in doubt consult your owners manual - the holly grail! My manual says
that:

Engine Oil Grades   /    Temp Range Good For
SAE  20W-50  /  15' F to 105' F
SAE  15W-50  /   0' F to 105' F
SAE  15W-40  /   0' F to 105' F
SAE   10W-30  /  -20' F to 70' F
SAE    5W-30   /  -20'F to 30' F
SAE    5W-20  /  -20' F to 10' F

	I use Mobil-1, Synthetic Oil, 15W-50 all year round. I feel that here in
Washington DC the weather rarely gets bellow 10' F. And I feel that that any
Turbo Charged engine can use the added safety margin that Mobil-1 affords. I
feel that 15W-50 for a car with high miles, mine has 160K miles, that it is
on the loose side of tolerances any way, hence the need for a thick viscosity
motor oil. By the way my car uses one quart of oil every 2,500-3,000 miles.
If you live where the weather gets bellow 10' F - I would use 10W30 Mobil-1.
Just my .02 cents worth. 

					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

BadBob,
Thanks for the response, I am leaning toward a bad head gskt, I checked my oil
and it looked to be good. Please let me know what you find out with the gases,
I would really like to know. By the way, is your car chipped? I am sure if I
had a head gskt going bad the extra power the chip gives, put extra stress on
the old head gskt.        
Thanks again,
Colin F. '86 951
