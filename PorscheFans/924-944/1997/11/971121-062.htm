Dear Bob & P-Fans
	If you enjoy the theory of "whys and how's of horsepower tuning I highly
recommend the following books:

"Performance Tuning in Theory & Practice" 
by A. Graham Bell,  ISBN#0-85429-275-6

"Tuning - New Generation Engines for Power & Economy" 
by A. Graham Bell,  ISBN#0-85429-609-3
	
	These two books shed some light on mysteries of "making horsepower", they
are a great read for the tech-ies out there on the list. 

"Bosch Automotive Handbook" by SAE (society of Automotive Engineers) lots of
tech information. Tech-ies prepare for overload!
available thru book stores & SAE, ISBN#0-89883-518-6

--------
	Speaking of making more horsepower for turbo charged cars - I was wondering
if anyone out there has eliminated the PCV system. PCV (or Positive Crankcase
Ventilation) re- routes oil fumes and/or blow by back into the intake
manifold system. I believe that the oily film cuts down on the inter coolers
efficiency to dissipate heat. Bob's water injection idea - would also do the
trick but removing the PVC and just installing a breather I think would
really improve the heat transfer of the inter cooler. I would also remove the
inter cooler and thoroughly clean out the inside of it.  What does everyone
else think? 

								Thanks All, Davidjalai@aol.com

David,

EXCELLENT post!!!
And I don't say that just because you addressed boost.  My senior year I took
a class called "Internal Combustion Engines".  Turned out to be my favorite
class. From what I remember, it sounds like you're right on the button.

	 Anyway, you've reinforced my need to cool down my intake and install an AF
meter.  I have the cone filter setup, and the air is much hotter going into
the intake.  I plan on constructing a new AFM to Turbo boot, so the AFM and
filter will be positioned behind the drivers side head light.  I'll then box
it off, and I'll have cold air again, I'll be able to install inter cooler
pipes without bends in them, the 110degree bend in the boot will be gone, AND
I'll be able to install a windshield washer sprayer to mist the inter cooler
at full throttle.  Honestly, I feel all of this will net me a good 20 Hp, and
the engine will run cooler.  THEN, I'll tweek the boost up a bit!!!

Thanks again for the excellent post,
Bob
