Many thanks to the many members of this list who responded to my =

"newbie" question about the standard expected of a Main Dealer's =

pre-purchase check.  Since asking for your views, I see I am not alone =

in being done by a dealer: my sympathies.  FYI I've summarised the =

lessons learned below =


My story: I purchased a Porsche 74 point pre-purchase check which was =

sold as suitable for a 1984 924. Within days of buying the car I found I =

needed to have new rear brakes and cylinder head work etc. (to the value =

of 2k pounds) and the car was still unreliable. =


=80First question: was I sold the appropriate type of check? NO
Chris Mellor gave me a listing of the points included in the Porsche "74 =

point check" (cost in UK is in the region of 100 pounds including tax).  =

It is VERY limited in scope and clearly is NOT sufficient for an older / =

high mileage car - a point subsequently agreed by the dealer who now =

claims to have withdrawn it.

=80Second, did they do this limited check competently? NO
At the very least the state of the brakes should have been noted.  Spark =

plugs are not inspected in Porsche's 74 points (neither are cylinder =

compressions). =


=80Third, was I given a bad deal? - YES!!!!!! =

Bad deal and bad advice. The overwhelming view of list participants was =

that an examination by an independent mechanic would have been a much =

better than obtaining the opinion of one of the top Porsche dealers in =

the UK. It would also have cost a lot less. Many (most? all?) dealers =

are simply out to make a profit at minimal effort and (depite friendly =

links with Porsche clubs in GB or USA) the bottom line frequently takes =

precedence over "service" or "care". Smaller independents have a name to =

make/preserve and can't rely on the profits from high value sales to =

mask any incompetence or cutting of corners. =


=80And the outcome? =

I'm planning on some lessons in car maintenance. More immediately, I am =

in negotiation with the dealer  and hope to be getting some recompense: =

if and when they finally manage to get the 924 running. =


Thanks again to the Pfans lists and PCGB  for  guidance and advice.
