OK, without getting into the background: my car was stuck in the snow and
I was watching the rear wheels spin from inside the car.  (Don't ask.) 
However, something strange that I noticed is that I could hear the
spinning sound but the wheel I was looking at wasn't moving.  I made sure
the clutch was out all the way and that the screaming sound wasn't the
clutch exploding (the car drives fine, by the way) and, when I gave the
car more gas, the wheel did indeed turn.  Again, I could hear the other
wheel spinning the whole time.

You first thought (might) be: so what, it's limited slip.  But I have a
'79 924 and, to my knowledge, no 924's came with LSD even as an option.

I figure I must have overlooked something obvious, like a broken axle. 
(Well, maybe not *that* obvious.)  Is this supposed to happen?  Is it
indicative of some sort of problem (like the transmission being only
loosely attached on the left side)?  (God, I hope not.  That would be a
nightmare.)  Again, the car drives perfectly normally.

Any help, especially with explanations if it's not LSD (which must be the
case), would be much appreciated.
