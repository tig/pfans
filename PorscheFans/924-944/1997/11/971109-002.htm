Jim,

I can answer some of your questions


=>
3. Anyone experienced with the front control arm/ball joint rebuilders-
who's
good and who's bad?
<=

Don't pay too little - that's all I can suggest. Apparently the ones
from Automobile Atlanta are OK.

=>
4. Anyone know where to get poly/delrin or other hard bushings for the
stock
front swaybar? I hate to spend $300+ for a Weltmeister sway bar just
because
<=

If you get the swaybar just for the bushings, they'll be the wrong size
anyway. I bought a used TurboS swaybar that came with bushings, etc, and
it cost be $75. Then get a Weltmeister adjustable for the back and your
OK.

The drop links move you to ASP (my class). But with springs, sway bars
and shocks you CAN be competitive in ASP.

=>
5. I'm planning on replacing the front coil springs with factory new,
but
wonder about the torsion bars in back. Since I have zero experience with
t-bars, would it improve handing any to change these (but have to remain
P
original)?
<=

Don't beleive so.

=>
7. Opinions on what brake pads to use? Auto-x and Porsche events will be
about it- the car will only be driven occasionally on the street (most
of
that to events- 160 miles away).
<=
Don't use metal masters! I hear that Cool Carbons are good.

=>
8. Any suggestions on who to balance/blueprint fuel injectors? I have
one
that's leaking anyhow (producing occasional dieseling- a new one for me
in an
F.I. car) so thought I'd get them all checked/worked on anyhow.
<=

There are a couple of places listed in Excellence, but I have also heard
that a new injector is the nly way to go...

=>
8. And lastly. Anyone tried Kumho R compound tires and have an opinion
vs.
BFG?
<=

I've heard good things about the Kuhmo's. The BFG's are OK for track use
but not great for autocross. I would also suggest the Yokohama's.

=>
89 Plymouth Sundance brown (appropriate)
<=

Sell it and use the money for upgrades!!!
