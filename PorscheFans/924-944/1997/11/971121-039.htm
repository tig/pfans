Wow. Does anyone have a 944 that idles properly? By far, the single most
common problem currently being experienced by contributors here is taht
their cars won't idle.

My previous 944 (a 1983 car) was exemplary in this department. It did not
mind if it was hot, warm, cool or brass monkeys - the tacho needle would
point at exactly 900rpm. Even after a horrid traffic jam. Still 900, without
fail. Incidentally, this car used NO oil. Well, about 0,2 litres between
6000 mile oil changes :) The only thing that would make it drop was a heavy
elevtrical load (rear demist, wipers, lights and blower, all at once) - then
it would be about 850 rpm.

My current car is a bit different. It is a 1985 car. On paper, the only
difference is that it has power steering. However, I now have the dreaded
rough idle. From stone cold, its OK. When hot, its OK to. It is the warm-up
phase that gives the problems. Sometimes, it idles roughly arounf 700, its
idling speed sometime cycles between 700 and 900 every few seconds, and
sometimes it goes out altogether.

I suppose that the power steering imposes load on the engine during idle.
Otherwise, all should be the same. But it isn't. I've checked all the vacuum
stuff - no problem. This car does use oil - 1 litre every 2500 miles -
normal 944 stuff. I do wonder if oil mist in the crank breather or oil
sucked down the valve stems is the cause.

Rest asured, if I come up with a solution, I'll let you all know.

All the best
Alistair
