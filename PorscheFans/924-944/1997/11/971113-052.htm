Hi Michel

Don't panic .... sometimes the gurus are not around or maybe they have
answered this question at least 50 times :-(.

I did the oil cooler on my 85.5 944 last year and recently the same job
on a 83. They are identical .

I did mine without removing the exhaust pipes and by just moving away
the Power steering pump. It is "doable" but you need some ingeniosity to
put the thing back together since it is so tight in that area.

I did the 83 without the exhaust (and the car had no PS) so it was much
more easier. We did that at the same time that we did a head rebuild
...... after a timing belt slippage ... ouch!!!.

If I was to redo my 85.5 I would remove the exhaust manifold .... it
takes only 1/2 -3/4 hr to remove ... unless you have severe rusted
bolts.
After the removal of the exhaust manifold .... the job is straight
forward. You need to make sure the pressure relief valve guide is well
align with the oil cooler housing (there is a tool for that but if you
are not rushing things it can be done without it).

There is an upgraded oil cooler housing and an updated relief valve (
single part instead of three separate parts). The oil cooler upgrade is
not necessary ... but the relief valve could be upgraded ... but it is
not cheap. You may hear horror story about stuck relief valve (old
model) but if the plunger is not pitted or the sleeve is OK and for sure
it is well align you should be able to keep the old one ..... but it is
my opinion and other may think otherwise.

I wrote a procedure quite a while ago concerning the installation. If
you need it let me know coze I'll have to search on my old computer for
that.

Hope this helps
