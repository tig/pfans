Hi P-fans,

I have a lot of questions about upgrading my 944 S2's suspension.

My goal is to get more overall stiffness into my car's suspension
because the S2's stock setup is too soft for hard driving, IMHO.
Car is also used on the slalom track!
- I want to reduce body roll while cornering. 
- I don't want the nose to dive in so far while braking hard.

Let's start with my current setup:

944 S2, no M030 sport suspension, Built Feb. 1991
Front wheels: Michelin MXX3 Pilot SX, 17" 225/45
Rear wheels: Michelin MXX3 Pilot SX, 17" 255/40
Front sway bar: 26.8 mm (stock)
Rear sway bar: 18 mm (stock=16 mm)
Everything else is stock.


Now my basic questions:

What would be the correct sequence to replace my current suspension
parts to gain best effects at first?
1. springs + torsion bars
2. shocks
3. sway bars
4. front strut brace

Is this sequence correct?

Is changing springs/torsion bars advisable without also changing the
shocks?

Do i also have to exchange my sway bars for stiffer ones at the same
time as i do 1+2?

Parts i've choosen so far (not yet ordered):
- front shocks: Koni gas sport struts, 1237L-Sport, 1237R-Sport
- rear shocks: Koni gas sport struts, 1035-Sport

Parts in question:
- rear torsion bars: is 28mm ok?
- front springs: ~250lb. Which will fit on my car? (Don't want to
  lower car)

Will t-bars + springs also reduce body roll? Or can this only be
influenced by stiffer sway bars?

I'm sure that other questions will follow ;-)


Thanks in advance,
    Guenter
