Please, to all the lunkheads out there (who unfortunately don't read this
forum) please, keep hitting my car.  I bought my '86 951 last January and
quickly had some minor front panel damage due to a bicycle and some rocks.
That was repaired under comprehensive, no charge to me.  A few weeks ago
someone hit my driver's side bumper pad at a few mph while I was waiting
for a slug bus to pull out.  He now is indebted to my insurance company
$330 dollars as he had no insurance, and I have a repainted bumper to
match the nose.  I just need someone to gently scrape my driver's side
front fender and I'll get rid of those pesky parking lot dings.
This is better than Leningrad.
