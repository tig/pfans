Maybe I'm just lucky when it comes to my car,(88-951) but I am suprised
when people say that our cars need repairs all the time. (Mitch Fugit) If
my mechanic made the comment about keeping another car for a daily driver,
I would be looking for another mechanic. I've driven mine (my only car) for
2 1/2 years and it hasnt left me stranded yet. The only major repair was
the clutch fork breaking( this seems rare) and I could still drive the car
to the shop. I agree that repair costs are high( ever fix a bimmer?) but I
dont see them needing repairs any more than any other high mileage car. (My
Honda CRX left me stranded twice after 60000 miles) I think the key is a
knowlegable mechanic(mine was a dealership watercooled specialist for 15
years) and not letting anything go until it breaks. Again, maybe I'm  just
lucky, but I have no reason not to trust my car. I would however, be
reluctant to buy a pre 85 1/2 because I think the kinks were worked out in
later models.
