I haven't had an opportunity to try the new 75 mph zones. But I do know
it works at 55 & 65. Most speed limits are set 10-15 mph slower than
they need to be because they know the actual mean speed is higher than
the posted limit. You still have to be wary, of course. If the cop gets
behind you, slow it down to the speed limit to show deference - same for
when he is clearly visible beside the road.

But my experience has been that they will give you 10 to 15 mph latitude
as long as you are alert, you show deference to authority, and you are
not driving erratically. If you get off the interstate, be more careful
around towns. I wouldn't speed through any local town in a Por$che.

I don't think you will get much snow in this region outside of a big
storm. I'd watch the local weather. If there is a storm in the area, you
are probably better off keeping to the interstates.

I wouldn't worry about it too much, particularly if the car has been
running without problems. My 'new' car got stuck from Houston to NYC but
the PO told me it had been acting funky for a while. It turned out to be
a speed sensor going bad. 

I-40 is very deserted through New Mexico and Utah - not as deserted as
the roads I mentioned, but I doubt you will be able to get P-car parts
outside of Albequerque or Flagstaff. So if you get stuck and need
anything at all, you are going to have to wait for UPS or FedEx the next
day anyway. A lot of people who drive these cars in more remote areas
carry spare belts and hoses.
