I had a comprehensive check done on my  before I purchased it.  It 
cost me the best part of  100 quid (UK pounds), and took 3 hours.  
The car passed with quite a long list of minor problems, most of 
which I was already aware of.

About 200 miles and 2 weeks later I took the car into the same 
workshop (a very well regarded local independent porsche specialist) 
for a clutch job, belts discs etc etc.  Unfortunately they discovered 
on changing the clutch that the double mass flywheel had too much 
movement in it.  The really irritating thing was that the mechanic 
who picked up the car was the same guy who did the check.  He later 
said he though the dual mass was faulty because he could feel a knock 
through the transmission when he drove the car to the workshop.  My 
unspoken reaction to this was "shame you didn't notice it a few weeks 
earlier before I had parted with 18 grand for the car!"

Subsequently I got into a dispute with the warranty company about 
paying for a new flywheel and had the old part checked by a main 
dealer.  They tell me that it was not actually moving any more that 
normal but that the centre bearing was noisy.   So I am now left 
wondering if the independent mechanic was being over cautious.  As 
this job cost about a grand to carry out I could have done with 
hearing that it was really necessary!  To top it all, the knock is 
still present in the transmission and the mechanic is baffled by it.  
I ignore it as it doesn't seem to affect the driving.

So make of all this what you will.  I suppose we are all human and we 
can all miss things from time to time.  However I do think that if 
these checks are going to cost so much the workshop should at least 
give you your money back if an obvious fault is subsequently found to 
have been missed.  In an ideal world they should also carry out the 
required work for free under some sort of guarantee system.  But I 
think the latter idea is really hoping for far too much.  That said, 
if the workshop is not prepared to back up the inspection with any 
sort of 'money where your mouth is' deal, are you really gaining 
anything by having the inspection done?  

I once had an RAC inspection done on a Ford I bought from a dealer.  
Shortly later I found the gearbox was toast.  After calling the RAC 
legal helpline I was told that I would not have any ground for 
complaint as the dealer could claim that the fault developed after my 
purchase as they inspection would provide evidence that it was not 
there before.  Even though the fault was discovered only one week 
after purchase and would definitely have been apparent to the 
mechanic during a test drive.  

I suppose having a pre purchase check done makes the less expert 
amongst us feel a bit more confident, but when you actually break it 
all down, the only thing you can really hope for is reassurance that 
you have not overlooked some simple and obvious fault yourself.  
After all if you have got to the stage with a purchase that you are 
prepared to fork out =A3100 for a check, you must already be fairly 
sure of the deal going through.

I suppose the moral is that buying a car (even a Porsche) is like the 
rest of life...the only certainties are death and taxes (and that 
the cost of a Porsche part will only be exceeded by the time it takes 
to order it!)

Just my own observations :)
