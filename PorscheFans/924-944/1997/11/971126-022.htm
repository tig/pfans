Hello Guys,

See what happens when you pay people to work on your car! Seriously, if
this is the only thing they did wrong, you received excellent value!
Hell, I would galdly have paid $450 for labor. 

As anyone who has done a clutch job can tell you, the coupler is a real
PIA! It's a real bear to get the bolts loose, I was real afraid of breaking
the plastic(!) coupler, and then it's another pain to slide the couple
after the bolts are loose.

Anyway, eventually it all gets done. FYI, I have not had any problems with
the coupler bolts loosening. I don't even recall using locktite on them.

Very good point! Even though, as an instructor, I can tech my own car,
I try to have someone else tech it every now and then. Another set of
