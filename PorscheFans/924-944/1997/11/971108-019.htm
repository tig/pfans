Jeff, I'm assuming your tank leakage is the result of corrosion. It could
even be from the inside, if its at the top of the tank, as these cars were
subject to long storage in the winter in northern climes (especially when
newer), and if this was not in a heated garage condensation can easily form
inside the tank above the fuel line. I would always be skeptical fo trying to
seal the tank, but that being said, I know the home-built aircraft types
often build their fuel tanks from panels riveted together and then send the
thing out for sealing which involves putting a "sloshing compound" of some
sort in there and rolling it aroung to get all over everything. It must work
if its used in planes. You might try to find out from some folks in the
aviation biz (local EAA, experimantal aircraft association) where this is
done. It would be important to have all the sending units out of the tank of
course. A used tank from the same area could easily have the same problems,
especially if its been sitting in scrapyard for a while. Personally, I would
likely try a used tank from the west coast, especially california, where
corrosion just does'nt seem to be an issue. A guarantee on a local used tank
is just a promise to come up with another if it goes bad, but what about the
labor, which is the real bummer. Best of luck. Also, if you store your car
for long periods, you want to be able to have the tank full to minimize
corrosion.
