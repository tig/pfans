For months, I have been looking forward to driving at Holtville.  It is a=
n
WW2 Air Force air strip in the desert  that has been converted into a
racetrack.  My turbo was scheduled to be ready but as usual the schedule
slipped.  Instead, we worked on the S2 getting it ready and replacing the=

brake fluid.  We don't want to be picking cactus out of our teeth if the
brakes go south.  Scott, my S2 partner, keeps bugging me about tires, I
resist.  One of the old timers points out that spinning off the Holtville=

track can cost more than a set of tires.  We go whole hog and slap on a n=
ew
set of heat cycled R-1s.

When we arrive at the track, it looks really fast.  The new trick five
point harness I ordered from Jason will come in handy here.  After
discussing running either autocross or time trials, I say screw it and si=
gn
up for both.  Scott starts whining about hurting the car and only signs u=
p
for the time trials.  He is in the fast group and I  am in the not so fas=
t
(slow) group.  As neither of us have our time trial licenses, we are
assigned an instructor.  It turns out our instructors are in our run grou=
ps
so they have us switch run groups.  My complaint that I will now be up
against all fast guys or race cars falls on deaf ears.

As I pull into the hot pits to start my a-x practice runs, a 911 spins
exiting a high speed sweeper and comes heading right for us, the starter
and the sign-up trailer.  Those who can run and the rest of us sit and
watch.  The 911 stops in time.  I take my runs and start to pick up some
real speed.  Now I see why they talk about Holtville.  I almost lose it
where the 911 did however a slight lift keeps the 944 on the track while =
it
made the 911 into a spin machine.  The R-1s once warmed up start to feel
like driving on rails.  I finish my last run pushing the envelope and
staying on the track, this is great!

Scott goes out on his time trial run and passes just about everything on
the track.  He comes back pumped.

I crank down my harness an extra notch and join the fast time trial group=
=2E =

After a few laps, I am starting to roll again and no one has caught me.  =
I
come into a corner too hot, screw up my line and a 911 race car appears o=
n
my tail.  I can not shake him so I give him the passing signal as we hit
the straight.  He doesn't blast around me so I floor it and to my
astonishment, I start to pull him down the straight.  My instructor point=
s
out I should of backed off more and let him by.  I point out he should of=

been accelerating out of the last corner so he could of blow by me.

I can not argue and drive at the same time.  I screw up the next twisty
section and have big red back on my butt.  My instructor says let him by,=

so I do.  However, nothing was said about not passing him so I hammer it
down the straight.  I stand on the brakes at the last second, turn, roll =
on
the power, brake, turn, power, turn, more power.  Suddenly I have a red
whale tail filling my windshield.  It appears he entered the first turn t=
oo
fast and I got lucky and nailed the apex so I could accelerate out of the=

turn with the pedal to the floor.  I am shocked to find that I stay on hi=
s
tail.  Then he gets off his line and throws up a cloud of dust, rocks and=

assorted small boulders, I back off.  I lose my line and he starts to pul=
l
me again.

As we enter the straight, he is mine.  The next section of turns is three=

high speed sweepers, 944 territory.  I have a mental picture of using the=

extra 18" of concrete on the middle turn and catching him in the long
straight that follows the turns.  I stand on the brakes and downshift to
third.  #*!@, it will not go into gear and the damn clutch petal is stuck=

on the floor.  As I thrash around looking for any gear, my instructor
starts screaming about getting off the track.  I turn off the track and
watch the red sled turn into a small dot in the distance.  All attempts a=
t
getting it into gear are met with the sound of grinding gears, I cease
grinding.  My instructors comments about how well I was doing falls on de=
af
ears, I am bummed.  =


The P god is still angry, obviously he has time to take a personal intere=
st
in quite a few of us.  I swear off lusting after Citroen 2CVs.    Two tim=
e
trials and two broken cars, the curse continues.

Pulling the transaxle goes rather smoothly this time. The clutch disc
lining on the pressure plate side is toast.  It has separated into three
large chunks.  Jason at Paragon Products busts his butt to get me a clutc=
h
package with an updated improved disc.  I'm ready to start reassembly whe=
n
my engine builder starts finding fault with the new clutch disc, but that=

is another story.
