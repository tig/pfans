Think your '86 is supposed to top out at around 137 mph, but living above
7000 ft and having a tired engine, I didn't have such luck w/ a late '85.
And removing the cat didn't help. It pulled fine in 4th, but not in 5th.
Just upshift and find out what happens. High-speed cruising is probably one
of the less stressful activities for that engine as long as you don't sit
on the redline too long.
