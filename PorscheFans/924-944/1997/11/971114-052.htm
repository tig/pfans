Well, I just go back from my favorite twisties and here's the update on
what my car runs like after milling 1/2 millimeter off the head and
lapping the valves. (98K on clock)

In the middle of my favorite twisties(6 corners back to back) there is a
straight that is approximately 100 yards long.  I call this my benchmark
area, because I can always tell how my car or bike is running based on
how it handles that section.  I enter that straight after a third gear
90 degree corner and if I came onto the straight pushing the front end
enough to drift a couple feet I would get to the braking for the next
corner just as third gear touched or neared the rev limiter.  Meaning I
didn't have, prior to today, enough power to get into fourth no matter
how hard I pushed the corner prior.  TODAY, I went through there again,
didn't push the previous corner very hard and found that I run out of
third gear about 30 yards short of the braking marker (a tree).  So
verdict is, the extra compression and cleaned up valves helped.  I go
through third from 3500 to redline about a third quicker.  NOT like a
turbo, so all you f****** 951 owning A******s can get your clicker off
the reply button and keep your.....   :)  Just teasing turbo guys,
actually this would probably help you too, gives it a bit more snap and
is a piece of cake to do.  Just keep lots of open space in the garage
for parts to be laid out, cause there's plenty to disassemble.  Total
cost if all you do is mill the head is about $80 for the gasket kit
(includes valve seals, as well as intake and exhaust gaskets) and $40
for the machine work and a couple days of your time.....piece of cake. 
Now the water pump is another story altogether...and oil cooler
seals...don't get me started about alignment of the pressure relief
valve.  

Oh and how is my language?  I'm just starting to pick up this use of the
'***'  stuff.  I know I'm a beginner at Porschefans speak, but at least
I'm trying to blend in.  :)  Hey, I'm kidding.
