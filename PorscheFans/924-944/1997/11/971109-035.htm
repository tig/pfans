>am fully focused on the
crankshaft pulley.  BUT, when I put a screwdriver in the flywheel teeth,
rest it up against the case and prepare the 'big freeking breaker bar'
type pressure I'm gonna put on that nut like everyone says, a thought
occurs to me.  150lbs of torque, at least, on a nut which transfers that
to the flywheel which transfers that to the screwdriver which transfers
that to the aluminum case?  Now, I'm no metalurgist, but is this gonna
crack that case? <



I have been blessed with having been involved in the removal of two crank=

pulley bolts in the last year.  This does not make me an expert, but you
asked, soooo......

You will not crack the bellhousing.  The first time we pulled my engine,
the pulley bolt would not budge.  My engine builder threw everything in t=
he
shop at it.  He dragged out the 3/4" impact and then the 4' breaker bar a=
nd
bolt wouldn't break loose.  I questioned his flywheel lock (BF screwdrive=
r
end welded to a steel block with c-clamp), received a lecture on how many=

pulley bolts he had removed and stopped questioning.  He finally heated t=
he
bolt to a dull red and both of us pulled on the 4' bar.  There was a loud=

"crack" and I just knew the bolt had snapped.  Not so, it had just broken=

loose.  I'll let the engineer types figure out the torque but it is safe =
to
say it exceeded 150 lbs by double plus.  The bellhousing was fine.

On the second removal, I broke the bolt loose with a 1/2" breaker bar on
the first try with a regular wimpy screwdriver  jammed in the flywheel
teeth.

I think the factory tool (see Auto Atlanta catalog) also rests against th=
e
bellhousing.  =


Your best bet would be to give George B. a call.  His shop phone is
forwarded to his mansion.  If you are nice to the butler, he may let you
speak to George without an appointment.  George has probably pulled apart=

as many engines as anyone on the list.  He will calm your fears and will
sell you a bellhousing after you break yours. :-)
