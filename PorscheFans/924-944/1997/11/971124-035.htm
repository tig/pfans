     Hello to all, I would like to sincerely thank all those who took 
the time to answer my questions. What I am now thinking is modifying a 
mistake done by Porsche. The shifter passage is far too long, from 1st 
to 2nd, 3rd to 4th, and so on. When driving in the city and wanting to 
change lanes to overtake, one notices how much time one needs. 
    My shifter began vibrating a few months ago, I at first have no idea 
what is was. I was told is could be from mis-aligned camshaft belt to 
bad motor-mounts. I am now sure that it is the shifter itself that has 
worn out. (it vibrates at 4000rpm.) So now that I have to repair the 
shifter, has anyone tried in altering the geometry of the shifter. What 
I plan on doing is cutting off the worn piece and placing it upwards. My 
questions are whether this will work, i.e. will the shifter match up 
properly with the gear box; and how do you get the shifter out?
