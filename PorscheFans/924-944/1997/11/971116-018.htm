Hi, P-fans.  This list is great, and has saved me mucho dinero.  Thanks!

I drive an early-85 944.  It's been a great car.  But, I've had a strange
problem lately - the red alternator warning light started coming on about a
week ago.  Not a hard problem to fix, right?

Basically, when a combination of any of the following accessories are turned
on simultaneously, the warning light comes on:  headlights (low or high
beams), a/c, fan, fog lights, and rear defrost.  The light is dim at first,
and then, as more accessories are turned on, the light gets brighter.  The
radio does not appear to affect the alternator warning light, and one
component by itself will not turn the warning light on.  

This would indicate a weak alternator, I assumed.

So, I have:
1.  Replaced the alternator/voltage regulator, and tested the voltage of the
new alternator using the test delineated in the Haynes manual - it's well
within the 14-15 volts range.  
2.  Verified that the alternator drivebelt tension is correct - Haynes
specifies no more than 5 mm deflection.  My drivebelt checks out at 3 mm.
3.  Cleaned relays/connectors in fuse/relay panel and battery area, even
though they looked pretty clean already.
4.  Tested battery's voltage - came out at 12-14 volts with ignition off/on.
 Even switched battery with the new one from my friend's 951 just to make
sure testing accurate.  

Even after replacing the alternator/voltage regulator, checking belt
deflection, cleaning contacts, and switching batteries, the problem still
occurs.

So, is there a sender involved?  I'm thinking that, perhaps, there is a bad
wire in there somewhere, or an unclean contact.  (Electrical systems are not
my strong suit.)  That appears to be all I have not checked.

What do you guys think?  Have any of you had this problem?  Why is this light
still coming on?  I don't believe I should have to upgrade to a higher-output
alternator.  The factory model (Bosch) should be just fine.

TIA for any help.
