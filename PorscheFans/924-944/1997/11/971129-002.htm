Hello out there,


I'm back again with some questions (my poor car is falling apart on me).  
For starters, I know this has been addressed before, I saw it a few days 
back, but I can't find the address to which the message belongs.  My 
heater won't shut off.  How can I go about turning this thing off?  
Also, out of the blue, my antenna doesn't come up.  It just decided not 
to work yesterday.  I gave a little pull to the antenna and I could feel 
that the thing was offering resistance, or at least the motor was 
pulling back on it.  Every time the key goes into the ignition, the 
antenna comes up.  Is this the same with all of yours?  Now, nothing 
comes up, and I get no sound.  Oh, by the way, I do not have the stock 
stereo.  I have some sort of BMW crap in there in which the tape player 
does not work and for all I know, the damn thing could've been stolen 
(ask me if I'm bitter =)  Anyways, I changed the fuel filter yesterday 
and it was a total fiasco.  We couldn't get the tubing off for the life 
of us.  Finally, utilizing blood, sweat, and good 'ol American ingenuity 
(my friend and I are both engineering students at UT Austin, so at least 
our tuition is doing something worhtwhile).  With the new filter on, 
it's leaking gasoline.  Not horribly, but noticeably.  We put as much 
torque as leverage would allow, but the thing is still leaking.  Any 
ideas on any of those would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
