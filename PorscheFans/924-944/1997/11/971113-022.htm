No offense taken.  I believe my setup in my car was derived from work
John Milledge had done previously for a race team or perhaps the factory
race team?  I've tried contacting him for information in the past without
much success, so rather than try and contact him for info, Darren is going
to try the Milledge chips in his new 89 and then we can report back to
the list as to HP, driveability and boost level as well as reliability once
we get some track and street miles on the car.

Sounds interesting, any more details?  ie, turbo setup, exhaust, etc, etc.

My intention in my three part post was not to be the absolute expert,
I don't know if there are absolute experts in anything in this world,
my intention was to give 99% of the people on this list a better understanding
of how their turbo system functions in our cars.  I think I achieved that.
