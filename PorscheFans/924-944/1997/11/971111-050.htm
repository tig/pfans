I would like to Thank everyone who gave me suggestions on  solving the A/=
C
Problems.  I have decided to go with a Sandan Rotary compressor and switc=
h
over to R134 while I am at it.   Got the compressor and the conversion ki=
t
from Vertex. (pretty good price) Have any of you done this change over?  =
Is
there anything I should know before spending a weekend and a 12pack of be=
er
on the project?   Thanks in Advance.

We did the conversion on our S2.  We bought the kit from Griffiths
Technical.  Had to cut off two of the ears on the compressor (they marked=

which ones) and had to have a hose made at the A/C shop.  Make sure your
kit is a true bolt on.  When you have the local A/C shop evacuate the R12=

(please don't vent that crap into the air) ask them to take a look at you=
r
kit.  We had our shop charge the system with the R134a.  It works great a=
t
less cost than a rebuilt stock compressor.
