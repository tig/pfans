	My 87 944S has developed, in the last the few days, a reluctance to start.
Perhaps its depressed? Engaging the ignition results in a brief "catch" of
the engine 
which then immediately dies.  A second attempt to start,
accompanied by the use of the throttle, results in a start, but I fear I am
about to be stranded.  It seems this occurred a couple of years ago, and a
mechanic, who I later found out knew next to nothing about next to
everything, 
told me it was the fuel pump relay.  Of course, I can find no such beast on
my vehicle.  Whaddya think?!
