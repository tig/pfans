Thanks to everyone who forwarded their suggestions and
comments about my fuel problem with my '77 924 that died last week. It
turns out the fuel pump has definitely died. I've got a replacement on
order. I suspect highly that this was killed by bad gas, because my rental
car started running rough after filling up at the same gas station! Looks
like water in the fuel, as I have used that gas station many times
previously without any problems. I think I'm gonna stop buying Amoco for
awhile... This, incidentally, was the same way my last car died, though
from a different gas station...

Other things that were suggested as possible causes were:

Vacuum in gas tank caused by clogged vent hoses.
Water in gas 
Loose intake boot after air flow sensor
Bad fuel pump relay/ broken wiring
Plugged fuel filter
Fuel suction line clogged
Bad ign. coil
Vapor lock

Thanks again, guys...

As for the 924 registry, the list is complete (that is, I haven't received any
new entries recently). There's about 30 people on the list, I think. I'll be
verifying all information submitted as soon as I get a chance, then my
intention is to directly mail a copy to each person on the 924 registry (not
to the 924-944 mailing list) for future reference. 

Naturally, if you wouldn't like your information (name, e-mail address, car
type, web page address, and your location - city and state only) passed
on to others on the 924 registry only, let me know _when_ I contact you
for verification, and I'll keep you on the list only for the purposes of a total
count, and remove all other information.

If you haven't already submitted your information to me at all, and wishto
be included in this Registry of early 924 and 931 owners (sorry, no 924S
or 944 allowed ;), please forward your name, car info including notable 
modifications, e-mail address, web page address (if applicable), location
(city and state only) to me at:

vscott@fusn.com

Thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving...
