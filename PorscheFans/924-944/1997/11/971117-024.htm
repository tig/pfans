I presume that ".-- -.... .-- ..." is your "ham" callsign, but since I
don't read "Morse", could you please translate for us???

Anyway, I really like your idea of using those mysterious screws on the
side of the hatch opening.  I always wondered what those were for (at one
time, thought they were some type of adjustment to keep the hatch spaced
away from the opening, but realized they would do more harm than good in
contact with the frame.  They would also make a great mounting point for a
decent CB antenna for those of us who tend to make long trips (like to
Parades).  We all know how lousy the magnetic and/or thru-glass mount units
are - no decent range.  Thanks again for the idea.  Now, all I have to do
is get another car to try it out on.
