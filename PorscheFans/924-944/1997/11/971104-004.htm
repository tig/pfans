Hi everyone,

I've been a member now for four weeks (same duration as 924 ownership!) and
have learnt an awful lot.  Does anyone know if there is a 924 faults faq
around?  Something on the lines of 'if this part squeaks, that part rattles
and the other part drops off then your problem is ...' would be very nice
(and sadly very necessary).

TIA
