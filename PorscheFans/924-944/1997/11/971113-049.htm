I would appreciate some help from the list with an idle problem that became
noticable today.  I have a 1987 944S with 159000 mi. on it.  This evening on
a cold start up the engine idled rough and wanted to cut off at stop lights.
 When it took the notion to finally idle without cutting off, it would bounce
the tach up and down between 1000 and 1250 RPM's.  When I stopped for gas and
let the car idle ( engine was at operating temp. ) the engine would die.  The
only work done to the fuel system lately ( one month ago ) was the
replacement of the fuel pump, regulator, and damper.  What parts would be
suspect in the diagnosis of this idle problem?
