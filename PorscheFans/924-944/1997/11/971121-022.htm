Hello Menelaos & P-Fans
	I have found that Wurth makes a great contact cleaner. It's called Wurth
"Contact Cleaner & Protector (OL)", Wurth part #89360 for a 200ml can, costs
$10/can.  Wurths contact cleaner OL is the only contact cleaner around that
works 100% of the time.  At the VW Dealer I use to work at, we called it
"mechanic in a jar"! Wurth also makes a "OS" solvent which is only a
protector - not a cleaner! The OL stuff will remove crackling sounds from
volume knobs, penatrates block connectors, fuse boxes, and hard to reach
electrical connectors. Wurth products call be ordered from Wurth directly by
calling: 1-800-526-5228 or 201-825-2710. Wurth also has a neat automotive
catalog full of automotive chemicals and a lot of hardware stuff.  
	Car Care Specialties - also carries the Wurth line of products. CCS can be
reached at 201-796-8300 in NJ, or by e-mail: carcaresp@aol.com. CCS also has
a neat detailed catalog with car care tips - care and feeding of your Porsche
needs.  Note: I'm not affiliated with CCS or Wurth.

								Good Luck, David Jalai@aol.com

OK, this may sound like a really stupid question.  I visited Radio Shack
and some other electronic stores looking to buy contact cleaner.  There I
found tuner restorer cans and other mechandise but no specific contact
cleaner.  Neither could the individuals working there give me a
satisfactory answer about a cleaner that could be used to clean switches
and contacts, not leave residue not attack plastic parts in the process.
Any suggestions?

I will gladly post a summary of possible private replies.  TIA.
