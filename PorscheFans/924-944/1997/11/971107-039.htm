There have been several recent posts about balance shaft belt tension and I
have some comments.  

Several months ago I purchased new belts from the Porsche dealer and
installed them using the tension gauge.  There was initally a slight whine,
increasing with RPM.  I retensioned the belts after about 2000 miles.  There
is now no unusual sound.  If my belts are quiet when tensioned correctly then
out-of-specification tensioning should not be accepted as a legitimate
solution.

I was concerned when I first felt the balance shaft belt tension.  The
balance shaft belt  IS  very loose as compared with the camshaft belt.  Even
though the belts are tensioned to the same gauge indication, they are not
tensioned the same.  The balance shaft belt flexes more than the cam belt in
the gauge due to it's construction. 

I hope that this helps.
