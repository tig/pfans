This is to sing the praises of Schneider's, a Porsche/German car shop in
Santa Barbara, CA.  Some weeks ago I brought up the query of tires for a
road trip down California's hwy. 1.  With four new Bridgestone RE-71s, we
(my SO and I) were set, and the drive was great.  I guess we overcooked the
brakes a bit, because by the time we came to San Luis Obispo, the pad wear
indicator light came on (usually when there is about 30% left of the pads,
if I recall).  Well, we continued on to Santa Barbara and the next morning
I was faced with the prospect of continuing on to Los Angeles as is, or
finding a repair shop in town to do the work.  At least the dealer was good
enough to recommend Schneider's, and I gave them a call, explaining my
out-of-town predicament, etc.  Well, did they scheduled me in right then
and there that very morning (a Wednesday).  There were at least three other
951s in their shop, and luckily it turned out that it was only the front
pads which needed replacing.  We were in and out in about an hour.

Perhaps not the best way I wanted to spend a morning in Santa Barbara
(though they were within walking distance to the Mission), but they did a
fantastic job of accomodating us, so this somewhat belated Kudos goes out
to Schneider's.
