     I recently posted to the group about my sticky clutch.  The pedal 
     would remain engaged (ie stuck to the floor) but would release with
a 
     little toe-persuasion.  The general concensus (a big ole thanks for

     all the help), was that it was either 1) air in the line 2) master 
     cyclinder , or 3) slave cyclinder.  When the engine is not running,

     the pedal travels just fine.  I haven't noticed any leaks from
either 
     cyclinder and there is plenty of fluid in the reservoir. This
problem 
     seems to be worse on colder days. I actually took the car to a
local 
     shop to bleed the line, (due to my own slackness) to rule that out,

     and the mech. said he thought that there was no way it could be
air, 
     or the mast/slave cyclinder, that it was the throw-out bearing = a 
     major job= big $$.  The hard parts were all replaced this summer,
so I 
     question his assessment. Are there any other ways to verify or
exclude 
     air or cylinders?  Is there a way to check which cyclinder is bad? 
     Thanks for any help,
