My 1-owner/clutch 944 has given it's driver 124,000 smileymiles plus a few
respectable auto-x finishes.  I can brag on her safely now that she is tore
down for restoration.  Lifetime maintenance:

  1. 3000 mile oil changes (Castrol 20/50 & Bosch filters)
  2. 30,000 mile tranny/coolant/plug/belt/filter/wiper changes
  3. 3 sets of front pads, 1 rear, rotors never turned
  4. 1 starter, visor clip, & door handle
  5. 4 batteries & sets of tires

Yes, original clutch, freon charge, water pump, motor mounts, rotors,
bearing grease, cv's, struts, alternator, plug wires, ...  looks very
similar to an Accord service record doesn't it.  Hasn't seen a
belt-tensioning tool since the factory.  She banged on the "limp home"
clutch pegs for 15,000 miles before shame forced me to put her on stands.
You're prayers and list-cooperation are appreciated as I try to breath
another decade of life into the old girl.

Idea for other frugal P-Fans, I rented a Kubota backhoe for $30 1/2 day.
Used the hoe to set my motor in my front door(we're gonna spend some
quality time together), used the trailer to haul the chassis to the paint
shop, and still had time to move some dirt in the backyard.
