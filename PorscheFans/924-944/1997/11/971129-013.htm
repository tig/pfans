Both the camlock and latch style should be legal in whatever type of event
you run.  Which one you decide on will likely be based on personal
preference and cost. No problem attaching the shoulder straps to the rear
seat belt points but you will need to use a Harness Bar. Many of the roll
bar designs will feature a bar to which you attach the shoulder straps. The
stock seats make the shoulder straps somewhat prone to sliding down the
side. The best solution is to go to a race seat. If that's not an option for
you, you may want to consider a harness system featuring a sternum strap and
or H strap to hold the shoulder straps together. No matter what, check your
sanctioning bodies rules concerning restraints before proceeding.
