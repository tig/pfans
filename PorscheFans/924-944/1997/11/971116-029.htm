PFans,

        Some advice if you can please: My 1990 S2 with 80,000 miles makes
quite a bit of noise at idle which my mechanic says is typical torque tube
noise. The noise goes away to almost nothing when the clutch is depressed.
As a side note -I feel quite a bit more vibration at idle with the AC on
than without, is this normal? I recently test drove a 1988 Turbo S withe
43000 miles which had hardly any noise at idle (there was some which
completely disappeared with the clutch depressed). The question here is
would it be a waste of time and money to try to reduce this noise to lower
levels. I'm only beginning to be more aware of the noise as the weather is
getting cooler here in Florida and I am able to drive with the windows down
and no AC. TIA.
