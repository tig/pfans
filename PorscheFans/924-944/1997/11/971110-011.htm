John,

        With the help of Doug Donsbach (thanks man!), I was able to overcome
a very similar problem in my '86 951.  Symptoms included intermittent
ability to start the car regardless of how long the car had been driven or
parked.  And like you described, the dash would light up and air would start
blowing, but the starter wouldn't even stir.  The problem?  Loose or
corroded relay contacts.  Doug suggested I simply open up the fuse box and
tap or jiggle all of the relays before trying to start the car.  Worked like
a charm until I had more time the following weekend to properly clean all of
the relay contacts.  I guess the important relay in this case would be the
ignition/starter relay, but it's nice to ensure that all of them will be
operating when you need them.
        I hope your problem may be as simple as mine was, and good luck!
