Stuart, 

Increasing the size of your injectors alone may not be a good idea.
When You step on the accelerator, you're only allowing more air in to 
your engine.  The fuel is metered by the CIS according to the amount 
of air.  Because of this, they would only be an asset if you 
drastically changed the amount of air (turbocharging, for example)that
can flow through your engine.  Your stock CIS system is capable of 
flowing lots more fuel than it does now.  Bigger injectors might also 
have poor fuel control at your idle volume, making idle rough and 
increasing emissions.

In addition, the incredibly simple design of CIS injectors has allowed 
the designers to give them very good atomization properties.  

If I were thinking about injectors, I would probably look for a new 
flow matched set if performance is an issue.  I know there are 
injector shops that can match your injectors, but have never done that
..  I don't know if there's any power gain to be had.

Of course, I could be wrong!

To fit a new flywheel you must drop the transmission and torque tube 
to gain access to the bellhousing.  It is also possible to unbolt the 
entire engine and fix it while it's hanging from a hoist, but I guess 
that could get scary...

Good Luck

Dave
