After spending last night tracking down a few minor problems on my '88
951S, I noticed what appears to be an oil leak in the area of the #1
cylinder.  I am uncertain of the origin of the leak, but it is
definitely oil.  A small pool has gathered next to the oil filter in the
large allen/hex-type fastener just next to the oil filter.  It appears
the origin is above the #1 cylinder exhaust port.  The oil runs past
this point and past the oil filter to its final destination onto the
floor of my garage.  I checked the dipstick and the oil level was OK so
it appears to be a slow leak but a leak nonetheless.  Checked the oil
filter for proper torque and it was OK.  
1.	Where might the oil be leaking?  
2.	What about possible fixes?
3.	How serious?
Any/all suggestions greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Bart H.  88 951S
