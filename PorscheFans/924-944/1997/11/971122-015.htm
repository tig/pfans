Hi everyone,.
Hope evryone is getting ready for long drive during thanksgiving. Me
tooooo. 
Remember what happened to me with my water pump. Well I got it replaced
with a new one only $51, well it took me 4 hours, once because I forgot
the gasket seelent and the next time because I forgot to put in the
connecting house between the water pump and the thermostat, had to take it
off again. 
Well after everything luckyly there were no leaks. I think I set the
timing belt a little too tight so it sounds like a turbine. I will adjust
it again. Working on the car that day made me realize why people think
these cars are high maintennce. 
This is my theory. Most people who say this do not do their own work,
spending big bucks for mechnics is not an option to me , specially because
I'm still acollege student living on dimes. The other reason is they do
not shop around for the parts. Sometimes I have been surprised how much I
can save by doing a little research. For example just by figuring out if
the parts are switchable with VW ot Audi parts. If you dont follow these
steps your cost of maintenace will be 150% higher than what it should be.
I've heard people call me crazy for keeping a porsche in college, but they
always want to ride in my car. Go figure.
After graduating I will be looking at buying a 968 or a 928. I think
porsche is something you cant just switch, it's like a drug. This friday I
was driving with my friend, he was in his Camero and he was tring to race
me, but there's no way I can out run a 97' Camero in the staight away so I
waited till a sharp 90 corner and took it at 40mph ,no brakes. After we
sopped at the dorms he said " I think your brake lights are not working."
I did not see yem when you took that turn" When I told him I did not use
any breaks he was surprised, did'nt believe me. So I had to hake him back
there again in my car and show him. Oh well there was one more porsche
beliver in the world now. I love the handling in this and more than once
freeked out my female passengers, taking high speed corner. 
Well here's the bad news, some old lady complained to the police that I
drove reclessly. (I have no idea why) So the police shows up at my door at
6.00 in the morning to question me. I told them I have a clean driving
licence for the past three years I've been driving(I'm an international
student, so this is not the only driving experience I've had, actually
driving in Sri Lanka is more chalenging than here in the States.) 
So I'm waiting to hear from them. Some people really don't have anything
else to do with their life. 
Oh well I've used up all these space , sorry for  all the personal stuff.
Have ageat thanksgiving gals and guys. 

Yehan
