Um, just a random thought, here... were the rear spring plate bushings
inspected/replaced at the time of the overhaul? These are not available
separately from the spring plate for '85.5+ cars. One would only see the
bushings if the torsion bars were to be replaced (i.e., multi-hundred
dollar labour charge).

Now that these cars are approaching/over 10 years old, it is not unknown
for these bushings to be worn/torn/seized and need replacement.

I'm hypothesizing here (no flames, pls), but if these bushings *were* worn,
the rear suspension *could* act funny in a snap manner as the torsion bar
moved around. One would have to play around with the suspension on a lift
or bench to see what the true effects are. I'm just guessing there is a
remote possibility that toe/bump steer, for instance, could be affected.
I'm probably wrong.

My friend's '90 turbo recently had to have both spring plates replaced when
new torsion bars were fitted. There was no prior inkling that such
replacement was required. Given my luck with cars, I've already budgeted
replacement of mine for next year :-(.

Worn suspension bushings, in general, cause sloppiness that isn't noticed
because the decay is so gradual. The usual culprit in 944's is the front
the front anti-roll bar bushing, which is directly underneath the oil drips
that happen when the oil filter is changed. Age is creeping up on the rest
of the bushings now, though.

Er, just MHO here, but the "pattern" seems to be oversteer. It is generally
accepted that your average driver can handle understeer a lot better than
oversteer. Oversteer in a 944 is a lot closer than you think - drive an
autocross and you'll see :-)

Yes, 944 oversteer is *nothing* compared to early model 911 oversteer -
which in turn pales in comparison with 356 oversteer (even with a camber
compensator), but it *is* there, it *will* crop up in conditions other
more-understeering cars won't even notice, and a prepared 944 driver will
know (hopefully) how to deal with it.

Just my $0.02CDN.
Craig.
