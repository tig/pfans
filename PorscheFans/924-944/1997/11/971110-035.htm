Howdy guys,

In the previous email, we covered the electronic controls in your car
that control the boost pressure.  Now, we'll discuss various methods
that are commonly used in the 944T to increase the boost.

When reading about these systems, always think back to the simple model
of intake pressure to wastegate, it makes it much easier.

1. Wastegate shim as used by Weltmeister.  I've never had one of these
   things installed, so I can only assume that it preloads the wastegate
   spring within a confined area which would increase the spring rate.
   This would make the wastegate open at a later time with less turbo
   lag.  All this would do is change the range of adjustment the cycling
   valve has to probably 0.4bar to 1.02bar instead of the factory 0.2-
   0.82bar for the "S" models.
2. Boost bolt.  When we look at the simple model of boost control, we are
   trying to trick the wastegate by limiting how much pressure it sees.
   By restricting the banjo bolt on the intake piping, we cut down on the
   pressure the wastegate sees.  This method should not reduce lag (the
   chips do that in the APE setup), but it will allow the boost to be
   brought up to over 1.0bar.  Since this method does not play with the
   fundemental aspects of the wastegate's operation, the range of adjustment
   should still be 0.2bar to 0.82 bar except that the wastegate now sees
   less of that pressure and allows it to reach a little over 1.0bar.
3. Drilling the cycling valve is the most risky of all.  It completely takes
   the KLR out of the boost control roll.  The drilled cycling valve just
   is a bleeder valve, nothing more, nothing less.  By drilling a small
   amount, you may still be able to allow the KLR to keep some control,
   but in my car, to get 1.0bar in 3rd, you need to drill it enough to
   pretty much make the valve useless at controlling anything.  If you really
   want to do this, you could essentially remove the cycling valve altogether
   and replace it with a bleeder valve, it will give the same result.

Of all the methods above, I feel the boost bolt is the easiest to tune,
and easiest to install, as well as being very safe.  There is one downside
to all 944T's boost control mechanisms that are safe:  the factory, for
some reason, likely emmissions, does not allow you to go above 0.2-0.4bar
(depends if you are Weltmeister or not) under part throttle conditions.
This makes it difficult to get the most out of your wide aftermarket tires
in a chicane for example, like the one near my house :)  By drilling the
cycling valve, you can have any boost pressure you can create available at
any throttle position.  This does, however, make the car VERY hairy to drive
in wet conditions as part throttle can induce the most lurid slides you've
ever seen!  Perhaps that's why they did that, to prevent new owners from
killing themselves driving the new "friendly" Porsche.

I hope that you have found this helpful and I hope that someone would
put this into the FAQ if they deem it worthy.  We have some VERY smart
people on this list who actually do tuning for these cars and if I've
made any errors, feel free to correct me and the FAQ.  I've written this
all based on my observations of how the 3-4 944T's under my command
operate and from various tests done (including one blast past 1.4bar!)

BadBob951, I hope I've answered all of your questions! :)

Farzaan.
             An infamous person by the name of Mr. WOT once said:
  "I love turbochargers, one day I'm gonna turbocharge my damn lawnmower!"

Note for CACCSOLO readers: The Porsche list calls me Mr. WOT for some
reason :)  We all know, I'd never go Wide Open Throttle around the first
corner in an auto-x or anything like that!

I wonder if you can turbocharge a 2-cycle kart . . . hmmmm . . .
