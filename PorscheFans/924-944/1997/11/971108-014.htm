I've read the posts about the top speed in a 944, and thought I'd share
my experience.

In my '85.5 944, I topped it at 130 MPH, and it would go no faster. This
is in 5th gear and about 6000RPM, with two adults, a full fuel load, and
a full load of luggage onboard. Locations was on a flat, level section
of QEW 2 betweem Detroit and Toronto, in '86. I noticed a few things:
The handling feel was very secure, and the cockpit a surprisingly calm
environment, as it should be in a Porsche, I surmised! The noise level
(wind, tires) was only a little higher than my usual 70-80 MPH speeds
(with windows and sunroof closed). The dashed white line was a solid
stripe, and the speedo needle was cranked way over in a new region of
the dial face.

Long ago, I read that Porsche states a minimum HP level for their cars,
and this information is kept secret so folks don't try to "cherry pick"
a particular motor by serial number if they were in some spec-type
racing class. Supposedly, performance claims are derated by 10% so all
the cars would easily and legally meet the published specs.

Btw, I notice in my '84 and my 85.5 owners manuals that the published
top speeds, 0-60 and 1/4 mile values are noted as valid "At curb weight
and half-load capacity, excluding optional equipment and accessories."
