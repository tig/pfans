Thanks to all who replied to my problem, especially Hanlon, John and Bob.
After I got home from work today, I went under the hood to look for anything
amiss (Last night, got home late, tired, etc.)  and found a bolt and washer
setting on top of the intake manifold (I think).  Bolt about 1-1/4" with a
small hole drilled through it near the top.  I looked around to find a place
for it to go--and found a home for it.  Due to the yellow sticker on this
fairly large black tube that runs behind the black box with the word *turbo*
on it, I discovered it was the air bleeder bolt for the coolant system.
When I stepped on the gas, I suppose the fluid rushing past caused the
"whistllng" sound.  Anyway, life, once again, is good.  Aside from needing a
little coolant, I'm back to normal (except for now having new belts,
rollers, etc.--which of course, is actually better than normal).  The only
problem is, leaving bolts on top of the engine, is something I might do, but
not something that I would expect from my Porsche mechanic who I'm paying
moocho denaro.  In all fairness, however, it was his 2nd belt job in 3 days,
and a real rush to get it done by 5:00.  Since the noise didn't start until
I was about 40 miles away, I figured he put it in, but forgot to come back
and tighten it.
