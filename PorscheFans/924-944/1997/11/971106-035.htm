You might want to try Bramall. They seem to know what they are talking
about. Here is what they told me.

Hi Richard
Thank you for your intrest in our products.
The 1989 Porsche uses a KKK turbo, part number 53269707042. This is a
K26
turbo that we can modify to increase the compressor output without
putting in a larger turbine shaft. The K27 turbo's has a larger turbine
shaft with higher mass. More mass in the rotating components of a turbo
can translate into turbo lag. This is because it takes more energy to
spin (spool up) a larger shaft. Engines that have been heavily modified
for racing use may require turbo output that is higher than that which
can be reached with even a modified K26. This is why we offer the
951.7042M which is a modified K27. We find that most customers with
944's
like our modified K26's because they avoid the lag that is there when
using a K27. The K27 will have higher output as is the case with the
modified K26 but it is up to the engine builder to decide what is going
to work based on the modifications that have been done to the engine.

We can quote some prices to you but you should give us a call on our
toll
free number 1-800-567-7559 so you can understand all the issues
including
shipping and handling.

Thanks again.
Regards

You might want to take this opportunity to upgrade to a bigger turbo.

Richard.

<< Talk to Jim Moder (moderj@email.kaiserslautern.army.mil) who ROUTINELY
 runs his 951S at top speed (150+) on the Autobahn. >>

I've had my chipped '86 951 pegged at 163 on the speedo.  This was after
timing it at indicated 80mph revealed 77.3 mph on the clock.  The motor had
about 125k miles at the time.  Has 145k now.
