Why?

What's the fun of racing if there's no competition? You might as
well be time trialing. Your goal should be to have fun. The number
of cars in your class should not really matter. How impressive is
a win, when there are only two or three cars in the class? If you
win in E or F, or some other class with 10+ cars, that means something.

By your reasoning, you should race in GT1 R or GT1 S. At pocono, there
were 2 cars in GT1 R, and 4 cars in GT1 S. Going on lap times, I would
have won GT1 S at Pocono. In class E, I came in 8 of 12. If I ran in
GT1 S and won, would that have made me faster, or a better driver?

Very true. So?

Good point. Don't race something you can't afford to crumble into junk!
There is racing insurance available. However, I don't know about it.
