Hey guys thanks for everyone who send me e-mail. It helped a lot.
Here's the deal
What hapened was that somehow the waterpump sized and the pull from the
belt was enough to break off the front part of the water pump and half of
the shaft inside the pump.
I showed it to my mechanic and he said the same thing "you are lucky"
Anyway I'm gonna replace the waterpump, I shopped around and found a brand
new one at NAPA autoparts for $51.14 WOW, and my mechnic wanted $130, the
list price was $190. I'm happy I saved a lot of money. 
At the same time I'm thinking of doing my cluch. Do any of you guys have
done the cluch by your self? 
Thanks again for your help
Have to drive the Ford for a couple of weeks more, It's killing me!!!
