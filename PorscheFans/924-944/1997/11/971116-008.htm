I now find myself in a bit of a quandary as I am flying long distance to
pick up a car that I have NOT formally had inspected.  I'm buying the
car
from a genuine Porsche dealer and they have sent me pictures of the car
and we have gone over the service history, which is complete since they
were the original selling and servicing dealer.  They say there will be
=
no
surprises and the car is exactly as represented... a very clean car that
has been well maintained by caring Porsche owners.

So, I have one week to decide whether I should pay another $100 or so
for
someone else that I don't know to tell me what I already think I know.
Know what I mean?

Tom,

If you can find some local 944 owners who can recommend a good mechanic,
have the inspection done.  The car may have been perfectly maintained,
but even flawless cars can eventually have problems -- expensive
problems.  Treat the $100 expenditure as insurance and a little peace of
mind.  If in a few months, an expensive problem does occur, you'll kick
yourself for not having spent the money.  Besides, if they find a few
minor things wrong, it may even help you negotiate a few more dollars
off the price of the car.

Good luck on the drive!
