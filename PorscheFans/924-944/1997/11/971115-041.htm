I have had a very good experience with my first set of Pagid (orange) =
pads.  Previously I was using Porterfield and going through them like =
water on the track.  The Pagids are more expensive but have exhibited =
much better wear characteristics.  Unfortunately they squeal something =
terrible.  I have a set of Hawks (blue) but probably will not get a =
change to try them until next year.

I disagree with KMR's recommendation of the Pagid pads, after having a=20
ton of problems with them this season.  The first set I used in '96 was=20
fine.  But subsequent sets have had consistent problems with material=20
transfer to the rotors and with aggressive and uneven rotor wear.  I=20
checked with a whole bunch of other folks who've used them, same=20
problems.  Current solution for me is Hawk pads, and so far so good.

BTW, real racers don't mill rotors.  They throw them away.
