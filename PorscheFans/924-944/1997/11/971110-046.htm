OK, I just can't resist taking up the gauntlet here.  With reference to the
stoplight grand prix between the red 968 cab and the '86 951, first, I was
NOT the fellow in the 968 (I do own a red 968 cab, but my wife generally
drives it and I drive the 968 coupe).  Second, in such a situation, wouldn't
a 968 accelerate faster, at least to the next stoplight?  I'm talking about
unmodified cars here, not Hansman's supercar or the like.  The 968 has 236 hp
and the 951 has 217, and the 968 has more torque at low rpms.  Car and Driver
got 0-60 in 5.7 sec for a 968 coupe in 1992, and mine feels about like this
(quicker than my 91 MR2 turbo, which should have gone 0-60 in 6.2 sec).  What
was the 0-60 figure for the '86 951?  What about for the 951S?  My impression
is that the 968 would beat the 951 and about match the 951S to 60 mph.  Am I
off-base here?  Remember, no mods allowed in this bench-racing contest!
