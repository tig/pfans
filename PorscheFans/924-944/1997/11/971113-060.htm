Time out guys!  This is a great example of how wars start.  The economy i=
s
doing fine, we don't need a war between Canada and the U.S. right now. =

Lets save it for the next recession.  =


I looked back in my files and reread the end of Farzaan's three volume
post.  He ended by saying that if he made any errors, let him know and hi=
s
post could be fine tuned.  The goal was to clarify any grey areas, do a b=
it
of rewrite as necessary and add this to the FAQ.

If most of the list members are like me, I do not know enough theory to
understand the finer points of the debate.  It would be great if the
handful of those on the list who know about turbo systems could go over t=
he
boost questions, pool their ideas and come to a consensus.  I will print
out two copies and let my engine builder (the master) and the local rice
burner guru pencil in any comments. Who knows, we may have a 3rd and 4th
opinion.   I'll email a copy to Jim Pasha next week.   Maybe someone can
get Milledge to review it also.

In the mean time, I'll post one of my half finished stories to hopefully
lighten things up.
