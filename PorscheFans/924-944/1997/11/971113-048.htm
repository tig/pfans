There have been some questions and discussions regarding the special tools
required for the oil cooler and oil pressure relief valves - like what they
are, when they are used and how they are used. I hope this answers some of
the questions and confusion.

During production years 1984 - 1986, Porsche used an oil pressure relief
valve that was comprised of spring, plunger and hold in bolt.  During the
production year of 1987 (from July 1986 engine production), this system was
changed over to a single Oil Pressure Relief Valve system - which is a
single element which has a rubber o-ring and four holes near its base.
Additionally, Porsche began to retrofit  the earlier production cars with
this new system at times when the cooler housing/seals were serviced.  These
part numbers and years that were effected are as follows:

1984 - 1986 944/T  & through mid-year 1987 924S - new part number
944.944.107.035.11
1987 944/S/T & late 1987 924S  on  -  part number 944.944.107.035.01

These parts are not interchangeable, as the earlier relief valves are about
3-4mm shorter due to the shorter length of the oil pressure relief bore.
Also, as I understand it, there isn't a simple visual examination of the oil
cooler housing, nor the oil pressure relief valve bolt head, to tell whether
an older (spring/plunger) unit has been updated to the newer type. The only
sure way to tell is to extract the pressure relief valve from the oil cooler
housing.

Since there are two different part numbers and lengths, obviously, there are
two different tools depending on the part # to be installed. Tool #9215 is
used with valve part #944.944.107.035.11 and tool # 9262/1 is used for valve
part #944.944.107.035.01.

When reinstalling the oil cooler housing (like when changing the seals), it
is important to properly re-align the cooler housing and the relief valve
bore. If incorrectly aligned, the engine may have excessively high or low
engine oil pressure.  This is due to the relief valve binding from incorrect
alignment of the housing/guide bores.  Also, as the new type relief valves
are screwed together, they could unscrew as you try to get them out -
leaving their lower end in the bore.

BTW, these relief valves are not serviceable, and require replacing if the
come apart of fail. The only replaceable items are the o-ring and the
sealing ring.

Anyway, I hope this answers some of the confusion around these issues. I
also more fervently hope I didn't forget any words that might caused me to
get inadvertently "flamed" for technical inaccuracies :-)
