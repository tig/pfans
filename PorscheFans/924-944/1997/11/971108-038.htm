The mechanics on the list will probably cringe and curse me, but I did the
following:  Since the BS belt whine on my car has not subsided after 3,000
miles (retensioned with the gauge at 2k), I decided to go under the cover
and reduce the tension on the belt.  The whine will not go away entirely
with a loose belt, so I chose a slightly looser setting than the gauge
setting, which reduced the noise quite a bit. 

Reminder: I didn't touch the timing belt.  It is set to 2.7 per the gauge.

I localized the whine to the tensioner/lower BS sprocket region.  An
imperfect mesh between the belt and the sprocket(s) must generate the
noise.  I had the tensioner replaced with the new belts, perhaps the tooth
profile is slightly different than the old. The car was quiet with the old
belt, and it was much looser than spec when it was changed.  I drove
15,000 miles on it (not knowing it was loose) with no ill effects. 

Before I started tampering, I ran the engine through varying RPMs with the
cover off to observe the belt behavior.  As expected, the BS belt
resonates at certain speeds, looking like a rubber band being plucked. 
When I reduced the tension, I observed the running belt again to ensure
the belt would not rub against the protruding portion of the water pump
pulley and the timing belt tensioner arm below.  There is no unusual or 
uncontrolled flapping.

I reassembled everything, all bolts torqued to spec, and went for a 
spin.  The car is nearly quiet now, and runs though the gears shifting 
near redline produced no ill effects.

If the belt eventually 'beds in' over the next few thousand miles and 
becomes quieter I'll just visit my shop and have it set to spec.

 -Gregor  944 2.7.  It's quieter now.
