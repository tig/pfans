Time to trim the household parking spaces by one. Have an 83 944, 
120K plus miles. New clutch, waterpump, belts, motor mounts, master 
cylinder, slave cylinder, tires, and paint. No body damage, save for 
the usual door type dings. Paint is Guards Red and looks great. Some 
overspray as it wasn't a 5K paint job. Manual steering, power windows 
(driver's side works) and power mirrors (neither work - so are they 
still power?). 15" cookie cutters with new BFG TA Comp 1's on all 
four corners. Lots of money invested, but don't have the time to 
continue project. Engine is sound but in need of a major tune-up. 
Smokes a bit but mostly from over rich condition cause by my 
tinkering in areas where I shouldn't :-).
This would make a great race project. Interior has seen better days, 
but it's not destroyed. Yes, the dash is cracked (but aren't they 
all). Car actually won third palce at a local concours recently (OK 
it was top only - but it still placed). Price is $2,500 FIRM. If I 
can't get this then I'll just keep it until I'm ready to do the race 
car project myself.
Let me know if your interested.
