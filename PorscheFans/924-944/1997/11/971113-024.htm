Hi Lee, au contraire. Regulations in both USA and Canada require that on
the 9th position of the VIN a check digit is used. Its purpose is to
provide a means for verifying the accuracy of the VIN transcription. It is
mathematically calculated using the other 16 (of 17) characters of the VIN
as they have been determined by the manufacturer. The equation is not easy
to describe in short. But basically a numerical value is assigned to
letters in the VIN. Secondly, a multiplication factor is assigned to all
positions of the VIN, except of course to the 9th position.

Then the numbers and the numerical values of the letters in the VIN must
be multiplied by their assigned multiplication factor and the resulting
products added up. The sum of the products is divided by 11. The numerical
REMAINDER is the check digit. IF THE REMAINDER IS 10, THE CHECK DIGIT
SHALL BE THE LETTER X. So, in the 9th position of the VIN there will
appear either the numbers 0 thru 9 or the letter X.

BTW I tried this formula on my S2' VIN and the check digit was correct.:-)
If you want to try yourself, you can get all the values and multiplication
factors by doing a search on the web (that's how I find out).

You may have been confused with the 4th thru 6th? positions of the VIN
which are XXX if the car is a non-North American model Porsche (i.e. Grey
market). Hope you find this interesting trivia.
