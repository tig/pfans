Has anyone had experience with installing the "revised" sunroof cable
assembly?  I have an '84, and according to the dealer and the shop manual,
the cable assembly was changed in '86 and the old style is not available.
The "update" kit requires that you remove two spot welded brackets on the
inside of the roof and to install the new, revised cable assembly onto new
brackets that you rivet on.  This has been a real pain, but I have finally
finished it ....except that the newly installed two gear/pin/slider
mechanisms do not properly engage with the sunroof because the riveted
brackets seem to suspend them too far from the top roof surface. (If you
have done this, you probably know what I mean.  If you haven't, you
probably do not want to know.)  And the English translation in the shop
manual is pretty unclear on the whole operation.  I am afraid that anyone
who has attempted this (seemingly simple?) operation is no longer on the
List, having sold the subject 944 in the middle of this operation.
