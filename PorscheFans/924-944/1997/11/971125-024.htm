Hi Bill,

In your part of the country you are probably correct. But in the NE they
have a catchall class called ITE (for IT Everything) - sort of a Formula
Libre deal. From what I hear the 951 will get eaten alive by some local
Corvettes that are just short of GT cars, but I'm just looking for track
time at this stage... Talk to the SFR folks and tell them you want a
place to play too!

I am having a very hard time understanding how welded-in roll cages are
considered legal for the 'stock' classes. I guess I now have to decide
whether I want to permanently 'ruin' my car to get that extra advantage.
Sheesh!

Thanks!

Paul

BTW, I am happy with my Smartcamber gauge. The attachment mechanism is
less than optimal, but I really like the fact that you do not need a
level surface to get a reliable camber measurement.
