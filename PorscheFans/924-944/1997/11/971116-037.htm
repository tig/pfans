Hello all,
There have been recent inquiries on both these lists about Camberballs and
other solid upper strut mounts. 
I used Camberballs in my 85.5 944 and I'd highly recommend them.  They make a
noticeable improvement in turn-in and stability at the track, and I think
you'll find
you'll need less static negative camber because you'll hold camber better in
the turns (at least that's what my pyrometer readings told me).  I was able
to get all the negative camber I needed with the stock adjustment.  There's a
surprising amount of flex in the rubber strut turnstyles, which allows the
outside strut top to move toward positive camber under cornering loads.
Overall, it was one of the most cost-effective enhancements I made to my car.
 Street harshness was minimal.

They're also very well made, easy to install (no drilling or other mods
required) and reasonably priced, even compared to the original-equipment
rubber turbo units.   I spoke to Bob Latham at the Pivot Group, which makes
Camberballs, and he agreed that if we could assemble an order of ten or more,
he'd offer a 10% discount.  List prices run from $179 for 911/930/914 and
$189 for n/a 924/944 to $259 for 944 Turbos (not sure about S2 and 968 -- if
they have the turbo-style strut mount, they would probably be $259).
  
Let me know if anyone's interested and I'll pursue it on behalf of the group.

Kevin Belden
