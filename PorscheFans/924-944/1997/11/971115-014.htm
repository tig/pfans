In the past couple of years I've had four cars inspected and was very =
glad
I did.  Three of them failed.  One was a 951S and it came out needing $5K
or more worth of work, another was an S2 that turned out to have been
involved in a very bad accident, and the other was a supposedly pristine
'83 911 SC with 43K miles that also had been crashed.  On this one the
owner tried to get the inspecting dealer to avoid telling me the car had
been crashed.  Of course that's the first thing they said.

I now find myself in a bit of a quandary as I am flying long distance to
pick up a car that I have NOT formally had inspected.  I'm buying the car
from a genuine Porsche dealer and they have sent me pictures of the car
and we have gone over the service history, which is complete since they
were the original selling and servicing dealer.  They say there will be =
no
surprises and the car is exactly as represented... a very clean car that
has been well maintained by caring Porsche owners.

So, I have one week to decide whether I should pay another $100 or so for
someone else that I don't know to tell me what I already think I know.
Know what I mean?
