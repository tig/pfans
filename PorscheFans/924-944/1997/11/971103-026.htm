Jeff,
What you describe does sound similar to my problem which is still not
solved(upon checking the FR hub this morning I found the pads had tightened
up against the disc). However I am not hearing any noises. I have a
vibration in the steering wheel that may be from the brakes. I had new
tires put on today so we'll see how much vibration still remains.

Good luck,
Joe
