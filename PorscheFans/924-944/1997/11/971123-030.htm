Hello Chris & P-Fans
	Here is the "wet & dry" sump definitions -  according to my SAE Dictionary. 
Wet Sump: An oil reservoir normally attached to the bottom of the crankcase,
from which lubricating oil is circulated. 
Dry Sump:  Of an engine, when main lubrication is supplied from a remote
reservoir, the sump containing no oil while the engine is operating. A common
feature  found on motorcycle engines and race engines. 

	A "Wet Sump System": (like that of the 924/944's) also has the oil pump
submerge in the oil level. The oil collect in the pan, gets pressurized by
the oil pump, and then up to and onto the lubrication points of the engine
(ei: head, camshaft, crank, ect...), then the oil flows down into the oil pan
and collects to be pumped thru the cycle again. 
	A "Dry Sump System": ( like that of the 911's) simply collect the oil in a
small pan bellow the engine, then the oil gets scavenged to a separate
storage tank. The oil gets pumped from this separate oil tank, to the
engine's critical lubrication points. The oil pump is located on the back of
the engine and sucks oil from the separate oil tank. Only a small amount of
oil collects bellow the engine, about 2 qts. The majority of oil is stored in
the separate oil tank, about 11 qts.
	 A "dry sump system" is not prone to the oil being pulled away from the
pick-up point of the oil pump. When you turn hard around a turn, the G-forces
pull the oil away from the oil pump. The oil pump sucks air instead of oil
and this is what causes engine bearing failure! On the 944's turning hard to
the left causes the oil to sloshes or slides right up the engine's side
(since the engine is tilted to right at close to 30' (?) angle) while the oil
pumps sucks air instead of oil! This is why it is recommended that when going
to the track you over fill the oil level by 1/2 qt to prevent engine/bearing
damage.

Subject: Dry sump.

What is it? How does it relate to a wet sump? 

Since oil is wet how can anything holding it, like a sump, be dry?
