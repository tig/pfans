The 924S owner's manual says that 30w oil is ok if the temperature
remains below zero, otherwise,

1.   It is NOT so specified in the owner's manual.

2.   As the engine ages, and bearing clearances deteriorate, you need a
heavier oil, not lighter.

3.   The owner's manual SPECIFICALLY cautions against single weight
oil.

4.   Your bank account can't afford the consequences for an engine that
already has significant rod bearing lubrication challenges.

There is a really STUPID rumor floating around 944 circles that light, single
weight oil makes the car run better.    It is based on the incorrect,
out-of-context
conclusion that some of these cars run better with such oil when cold.   The
truth of the matter is that they DO appear to run better, because before the
engine warms up, a heavy multrigrade oil can offer significant resistance to
smooth running, but the underlying problem is in the condition of the engine
managment system, NOT the oil.

Use a light single viscosity oil if you like, but CLEARLY specifiy this to the
next prospective owner so he/she can make the intelligent decision to find
another car.

And with this advice, you still have to pay for your coffee.
