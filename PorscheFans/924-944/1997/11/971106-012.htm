Well my head gasket repair is going quite smoothly.  Following may be
the reason it blew but here is my assessment, as per Sean Smith's
inquiry, of our top speed (85.5 944).

Had a date in the car last weekend.  She's one of those speed freaks
that I met at the track on my Sportbike.  Anyway we were on a long
straight toll road and she's needling me about driving my car to slow
(90 mph).  After not long of that nonsense I decided now would be a good
time to find the top end of my little porsche darling (female gender) 
At about 120 fourth gear runs out and I'm thinking "no way fifth will
pull"  But Porschefans....it does.  Slowly, pretty damn slowly, but it
does pull more.  Rpm's were over 4K in 5th gear and the speedo kept
climbing.  It stopped climbing at exactly 145 and would go no higher. 
Now I have 225/50/15's on mine which give 5.5% speedo error.  That comes
out to 137 mph without the tire size induced error.  Keeping in mind it
was LATE at night so my lights were up, creating substantial drag, I
think we may get over 140 actual with the lights tucked away.  My car
has 98K on the odometer and, up until the head gasket blew, ran pretty
good.  After she's (yep female, that's right) back together maybe I'll
find out about that lights up issue.

Oh, and to the few officers on this list, naturally I'm not telling the
truth, this is all made up, and I can have an alibi if need be.  After
that night, I'm sure she'll cover for me.  :)
