Hello fellow 944 drivers,
  This is my first posting! It is great to see so many of us sharing 
information about a car that I have grown to love dearly. 
  I think someone covered this topic a month ago, but it is now happening to 

me, and I cannot remember the possible causes. I have an 87' 944 NA with 169,

000 miles on it. I have been having a real problem the last two weeks with 
HOT starts. The engine BARELY idles. If you give it any gas, it stalls. The 
only thing I can do, is wait till it "get's over it," and idles normal again 

(about 15-90 seconds). I bit the bullet and got new plugs, wires, cap, and 
rotor (ouch! $$$). The old ones looked shot. I think the wires were 
originals! This did not solve the problem. At all speeds, it runs perfect. 
When idling at a stoplight, it is fine. When starting cold, it is fine. It 
seems like, the longer it sits when shut off hot, the worse it is about 
restarting. HELP!!??

Dear Kent & P-Fans
	A internal combustion engine needs two things - air & fuel.  Next time you
engine will not start, bring and extra spark plug, attach it to one of the
plug wires and ground the sides/threads of  the plug.  You could also buy a
test plug with one of those aligator clips attatched to the thread area - a
test plug I think they are called?  See while cranking if there is spark. If
so move on to check the fuel side. You will need a fuel pressure gauge,
attatch it on the end (oil filter end/side) of the fuel rail there is a
fitting that the gauge can be hooked up to. The regulator is near the fire
wall on the other end of the fuel rail.  I suspect that the fuel pressure
regulator is sticking - cuasing an overly rich condition. If you have a
freind with the same car you could swap fuel pressure regulators. Also check
the 10 mm  bolts that hold down the inductive pick up sensors above the
flywheel - sometimes they loosen up causing strange things to happen. 


				Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
