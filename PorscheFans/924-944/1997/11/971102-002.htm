For those who have removed the fuel rail my question is once all the
necessary fuel lines, vacuum lines, and bolts (4) are removed (per
Haynes), how easy is it to "pull the rail straight up and out of the
intake manifold openings". There is resistance when I try this and I am
not sure if there suppose to be any. Anyone?

__________________________

I had to pull a little harder than I was comfortable with, but it's
correct, as you say, just go straight-up... kind of use a little end to end
action to loosen 'em up...

when you read the installation instruction you'll note it says to rub a
little ATF on the o-rings, so I suppose they are just seated...

some tips from my experience (I am a shadetree mechanic):

there is quite a bit of fuel in the lines (you can relieve some pressure by
running the car and then pulling the fuel pump fuse- the car will cut out
soon thereafter) I wrapped the fuel hose in a couple of paper towels and
then rubber banded a sandwich baggie around the paper towels/hose...
Hayne's mentions some other method to relieve fuel pressure, but it did not
work on my 87 model...

also, use your head when removing vacuum lines... I pulled males and
females in such a way that it was obvious what went where when I had to put
it back together...

later...
