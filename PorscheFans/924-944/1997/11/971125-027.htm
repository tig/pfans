   I just talked to Bob Lybarger, who is on the Competition Committee
for the SCCA, and the 924 has been approved to run E Production for the
1998 season.  I don't have all the specs yet, but he told me that the
specs I asked for were only modified slightly.  The biggest he
remembered was the Compression ration is set to 12:1.  The also put a
few other cars in, like the Datsun 240Z.  Once I have more details I
will post them.

   They also made a correction to the GT3 rules for the 924.  I pointed
out the 944/968 are allowed to keep there independent rear suspension
with a 100lbs penalty, but the 924 was not.  This has been corrected and
the 924 may keep its rear suspension in GT3 and not have to switch to a
live axil if the owner doesn't want to.
