Hi Derks;

Actually there are five different types of half shafts available for the 944
depending on the year of the car and the transmission type.  You didn't
indicate the year/transmission type of your car, so I don't know which part
# would be correct.

Anyway, it's not uncommon that the left half-shaft has been changed.  As the
exhaust hangs near (just under) the left shaft, the heat from it is
transferred to the shaft and tends to dry out the CV's - causing premature
failure.  Seeing as how much easier to replace the entire shaft rather than
rebuild the CV's, many POs opt for just putting in the new shaft...

Hope this helps you out..
