Important information about the New York State Enhanced Emissions Inspection
Program for vehicles in the New York Metropolitan Area

The clean air act of 1990, required motor vehicles registered in certain
areas of the country that do not meet federal ambient air quality standards,
to undergo an enhanced motor vehicle emissions inspection. This test
consisted of a centralized I/M 240 (a 240 second drive cycle test utilizing a
dynamometer to simulate road and vehicle weight for the drive cycle). 
After much opposition and pressure from certain areas of the country,
congress amended the 1990 clean air act. These amendments gave the states the
right to implement their own emission test, as long as it accomplished the
1990 clean air act goals. 
New York State created a decentralized I/G (inspection grade) 240 test,
called NY-TEST. This test is also a dynamometer, drive cycle test, which will
measure CO, HC, CO2 and Nox. This will be a constant volume test and will
measure in grams per mile instead of the parts per million and percentage
that we are used to today. A high enhanced emissions test will be conducted
in the New York Metropolitan Area (NYMA). The NYMA includes nine counties:
Bronx, Nassau, New York, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk and
Westchester.The rest of the state will undergo a low enhanced emission test.
The high enhanced emission test consists of the I/G 240, OBD, emission
control and gas cap integrity. The low enhanced emission test consists of
OBD, emission control and gas cap integrity. Most of the inspection
regulations will be unchanged. Below is a summary of the NY-TEST. 

1.Annual test for both safety and emissions or upon change of ownership. 
2.Starting date will be Jan. 2,1998 
3.Program will last for at least 7 years. 
4.The dynamometer test will be required on 1981 and newer gasoline powered
vehicles with a gross weight of 8500 pounds or less. 
5.There will be an exemption mode, in addition to present exempt vehicles,
there will be exemptions from the dynamometer test. Full time 4 wheel drive
and vehicles older than 1981, and other vehicles not able to be tested on a
dynamometer will under go an idle test only. All vehicles that are subject to
an emission test, idle or dynamometer, will also undergo an emission control
tampering check as well as a gas cap pressure test and an on-board diagnostic
check (1996 and newer). 
6.The anticipated cost of the new equipment is $35,000 to $45,000. Maintenance
 contracts will be available at an anticipated cost of between $3,000 and
$4,000. DMV strongly advises stations to have maintenance contracts. 
7.Repair and diagnostic training will be available through New York's already
established training network (ATTP) but will not be mandatory. 
8.Waivers will be available, but will be based on a dollar amount rather than
a repair procedure as now, The dollar amount will be $450. This amount will
be adjusted annually based on inflationary factors. The waiver amount does
not include costs for repair of tampered items or non-emissions related
repairs. The waiver will be good for one year. Waivers will be issued by the
inspection stations. 
9.The proposed inspection fee will be $25 for emissions test and $10 for a
safety check, for a total of $35. 
10.The first year all vehicle emissions test will be an idle test, but the
inspection station will have to have purchased the dynamometer and will have
to commit to the vendor to accept installation when the equipment is
available. This will allow time for the installation of all the dynamometers
that will be needed for a successful program. 
11.There will be a camera mounted on top of the exhaust analyzer. This camera
will take a short video of the license plate, the probe in the tailpipe and
as much of the side of the vehicle as possible. This video will be stored in
on a video tape and be retrieved periodically. 
12.Unlike the present system, where inspection information is downloaded
periodically, the new program will require 2 phone calls per inspection. The
first to initiate the inspection. Vehicle information will immediately be
transmitted via phone to Albany. The second to conclude the inspection. Test
results will immediately be transmitted to Albany. The estimated cost for
these calls is approximately one dollar. 
13.There will be a repair screen, where repair information for cars that have
failed an emissions test and are reinspected, is entered and stored in the
computer for later retrieval by DMV. This information will include the name
of the repair shop, date that the repair was made, repair procedure that was
done and the cost of the repair. There will be a means to indicate a home
repair. 
14.There will be a diagnostic mode for pre testing, but all pre test
information will be stored in the computer memory. For statistical purposes,
the state wants to know all pre test information.
