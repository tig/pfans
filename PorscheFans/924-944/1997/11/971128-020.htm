The Porsche Warranty and Maintenance booklet (should be in every glovebox
next to the owners manual!) specifies most maintenance items by mileage
intervals and not time (except air bags, spark plugs, brake fluid and
coolant changes). 

However, this doesn't take into account that rubber parts are deteriorated
by age and atmosphere, as well as use.  I would replace the belts on any
car I purchased unless the replacement was documented by a receipt showing
the date and mileage the work was done.  Inspect under the cover for
oil/coolant leaks, which will cause belt failure in short order. 

My '89 W&M book states the timing belt should be replaced at 45 and 60k
(explain that one) and no mention is made of balance shaft belt
replacement at all(!).  It is generally accepted here that both belts
should be replaced at 30k, or sooner to satisfy the retentives. :-) Belts
are to be inspected and retensioned at 15k. 

Also, the S/S2 has a well known problem of chain tensioner failures - if
this has not been addressed in the repair invoices you received with the
car, the cam cover should be removed and the works inspected/replaced.  The
replacement cost of an S/S2 head is sickening, to say the least.
