Well I finally got my 86 944 started. First thing I did was take it for a
spin. :)
I dont know if this did it or not but I had tried to start the car for 2
weeks now since its been out of the shop and it would not even fire.
I got to the DME and unplugged it and opened it. It looked ok except that
the coating on the board is coming off. I plugged it back in and kind of
banged the plug back into place, turned the key and it started.
I noticed what looked like a crystal inside the DME when I had it opened. Im
just wondering if me unplugging it and plugging it back in had anything to
do with it starting. I sure hope so since that would mean that its the DME
that is at fault here.
Do any of you think this is possible. I have messed with radio control stuff
alot before and the transmitters have crystals. Im sure that its not the
same here but it looks like a crystal none the less.
Any input appreciated.
