Fellow P Friends:

    Well, I've finally sold my 944. It took a little while as I had to find
just the right buyer, but it did sell as soon as he saw it.  Just to let you
know, it was a beautiful 1986 N/A with 42,000 miles. I ended up selling for
$9,400.00 which isn't too bad knowing the market on these babies.

   I do have a few folks that e'd me between the time I sold it (which was
last Saturday) and today.  If anyone is looking to sell a similar 44 and you
would like me to refer them to you, let me know via email. I'll point them in
your direction.

  Guys...thanks very much for all of your help in the past. I have learned so
much from this page!  It's been really great. 

   Well...now I can begin my next adventure...A 356 Speedster. Have wanted
one since I was a kid. 

   Best fortune to all of you, and safe happy motoring!

times!)
