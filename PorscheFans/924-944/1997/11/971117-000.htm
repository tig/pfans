Ok, obviously there is some need for information...so I'll try to answer =
the questions I've recieved:

Jon:
<Do you have any worries about hitting something with it and cracking =
it? It is going to cost me close to 300.00 to install it. I bought the =
light kit also I can't belive how much that thing cost. The lights cost =
more then the nose did. What color is your Porsche??>
Yes, I have/had worries about hitting things...I got in a car accident =
about two months ago (bumper to bumper traffic on the 10 fwy and I was =
checking my side mirror to change lanes...looked back and realized the =
guy in front had stopped and so I slammed my brakes..hit him at about 5 =
mph...) anyway, the 944 is so low that the turbo nose went under the =
guy's rear bumper (it was a lincoln) so the damage was done to the =
header panel and passenger side hedlight cover and flare...$600 later =
everthing is fixed, the turbo nose held remarkably well despite getting =
pushed around by the flare being bent slightly...
but yes, you should worry about hitting things, and really slow down =
over bumps and the like...and my car is silver.

ENRICO AND JOHN DAVID BRESCIA:
<What does your turbo nose replace excactly? Is it the front spoiler, =
because if so, we were lookig to replace it=20
over the winter. How much did it cost? Where did you order it from? >

ok, the nose replaces both the front lower valance (the polyurethane =
thing) and the front bumper. You also have to remove the low impact =
shock absorbers that the bumper attaches to because they're too long. =
The spoiler cost $475 including shipping, and it was ordered from A.I.R. =
If you have any more questions, then let me know, if I get the time (I =
have school and stuff) then maybe I'll write some sort of FAq on how to =
install the nose and the lights...but I still have yet to do the =
foglights...

For everyone else:
One thing is make sure you buy the turbo nose conversion, because places =
also sell a fiberglass turbo nose for the 951, and the turbo flares =
differ slightly from the NA in that where the flares meet the nose they =
smoothly curve on the 951 and come to a sharp curve on the 944 NA. For =
people interested in weight (I really wasn't since I don't race (yet) so =
I did it for looks) the kit drops about 70lbs from the front...this is =
an estimate since I haven't actually weighed anything, so no flames. =
Anyway, the front valance (plastic one) probably weighs 5-10 lbs. The =
bumper is a good 30-40 lbs or so and the two low impact shock absorbers =
are about 10-15 lbs each. The result is that the almost perfect weight =
ratio of the 944 is brought just that much closer to being absolutely =
50:50.=20
OK, I have to post more later, I still have paper to write, and a =
drawing to do and its already 1:00am =20
