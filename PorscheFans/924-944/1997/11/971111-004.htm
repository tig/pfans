I couldn't agree more.  Without being able to lend a personal note to our
replys some of us wouldn't be able to participate at all.  My technical
expertise is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum when compared to
George, Farzaan, and some of the other guys.  Any technical replys that I
send are almost always based on my personal experience.  Let's keep the
personal touch to this list because that is one of the things that makes it
so enjoyable to be a part of.
