Hi Bill:

For sure for sure!  A 951 cannot be in ITA or ITS.  Only ITE(verything) if
allowed in your region.  Typical ITS cars in addition to the '83-88 NA 944,
are: 240,260,280Z's, 2nd Gen RX7.  ITA includes 924, 1st Gen. RX7, and a
slew of Jap cars like CRX's.  If anyone really cares, let me know and I'll
post.  (Don't have my GCR here today).  

On the roll cage issue:  I have seen the Racetec cages in both 944's and
911's.  Very nice, though around $2,400 by the time you get them installed.
 Have a friend who removed his autopower and installed one because he felt
it was safer.

My cage was custom built by a friend who builds and races IT and Pro-Rally,
 mounted on the door sills, and welded.  With a good cage like the Racetec,
by the time the mounting plates are welded to the car and the cage is
bolted to them, you might as well have a welded cage (as far as stiffening
is concerned).  IMO this is why PCA decided to allow custom full-welded cages.
