Hi all-
I am a Porsche newbie so forgive me if my questions are sometimes dumb!

In the next 6 to 9 months I anticipate buying a 924 from years 1980 to
1982.  I think it will probably cost between 3K and 3.5K to get one that
has been cared for reasonably well, and another 1K on top of that to fix
any emergency things that come up.  Are these appropriate estimates for
the initial costs?  And is it advisable to advertise that I want to
purchase a 924, or it sufficient to keep looking through classifieds
etc. to find 924s for sale?  And what suggestions, if any, do any of you
have for different places to look?  I live in Boston metro and would
consider going to any of the other New England states for the right
deal...   And finally, I would be quite interested in any stories other
924 owners have about finding, purchasing, and owning their cars.
Thanks for any assistance or comments you might have!
Steve
