According to the latest edition of the PCGB magazine 'Porsche Post', a 1978 
924 and all 931's will require to be run on Super Unleaded with every fourth 
fill being leaded, unless you modify the valve seats, in which case you 
would be able to be run on Ordinary unleaded.
As I understand it, leaded petrol will still be available but  not in all 
locations, in other places an as yet unspecified lead substitute will need 
to be added to your fuel.

What I don't understand is why the  EU can't leave the phasing out of leaded 
petrol to 'Market forces', as eventually there won't be enough cars using it 
to make it worthwhile for the oil companies to provide it.
