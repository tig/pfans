> I was on the
way home through some unfamiliar twisties in a neighborhood when I
experienced something that I didn't think 944's ever did.  I was exiting
a spirited 2nd gear 4500 rpm right hander when the back end started
drifting out.  I remember thinking, 'Nah, couldn't be....these things
always understeer, the front end plows a ways then you keep going' so I
kept my foot in the gas, but the back end got REALLY outside and I let
off the gas (lift throttle oversteer?) and there I was at 50mph sliding
sideways toward the next corner, I countersteered, but to little to late
I guess because I completed a beautiful 270 degree spin through that
next corner and ended up in the middle of the road facing 90 degrees off
of where I originally was heading.  I sat there perplexed for a second
thinking 'That didn't just happen'  but all the tire smoke pretty much
proved that it did.  Anyway, I pulled away still perplexed by the first
case of what I thought mostly happened to horsepower-laden vehicles. =

Ok, I'm definately going to a PCA track day to further explore this in a
safer environment, but to the racers out there, Does a normally
aspirated 944 have the horsepower to overcome the 225's on the rear, or
did that lift throttle do it?  It's also possible, in retrospect, that
the sprinklers were on in that neighborhood (all you northerners are
probably amazed that we still have to water our lawns here), I suppose I
could have missed seeing the water and just tossed down the road on wet
pavement.  It was fun, but I don't think I want to do it again, NO, I'm
sure I don't.  Wish I had a video of it though.  :)   I pushed my
Porsche beyond a limit, either it's limits or the road conditions, but
in either event, I screwed up and it didn't cost me a dime.  What can I
say, God must drive a Porsche too, or I'm just really really damn
lucky.  :)

BTW, Jim  She is quietly reviewing all resumes at her leisure.  She
makes a great screwdriver holder and will serve someone nicely as
another bottomless money pit, but at least this one keeps you warm at
night.  She says she really likes the picture you sent of yourself in a
G-string, but you really didn't have to.  She thinks the porsche tattoo
on you buttocks looks great too.  :)

Bob,

They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  As long as she isn't
laughing hysterically I may have a chance.  Does your toolbox go with the=

garage?  I'll trade you the G string for it.

You are a victim of water cooled spinning denial.  Yes, these little gems=

will spin under the right conditions.  The right conditions usually occur=

when we are pushing the envelope.  If you would of done a slight lift whe=
n
you first started to swing the rear end out you would of saved it.  Once
into the spin, the big lift killed you.  Stay on the gas and turn into it=
,
then unwind when you start to straighten out.   The equal but opposite
reaction rule does not apply to almost saving it.  I have a special talen=
t
for saving a spin, over correcting just a tad too much and spinning it in=

the opposite direction at warp speed.  I have yet to figure how I manage
this but am told it is entertaining to watch.  If you do go around, both
feet in, brake and clutch.  =


You lucked out with no damage other than maybe flat spotting your tires. =

San Diego PCA offers an outstanding driving school twice a year.  We even=

have a water truck to wet things down so you can really learn to throttle=

steer.  Any of the PCA driving schools will teach you more in two days th=
an
you would experience in two years of driving the twisties.
