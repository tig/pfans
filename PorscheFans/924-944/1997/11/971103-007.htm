I posted a messaged on Friday about replacing the oil cooler seals in my
85.5 944.  The service manager at the dealer told me I have the updated oil
cooler and will not need to the alignment tool for the relief valve.  My
coolant and oil isn't mixing but I wanted to update the seals before it
started.

I crawled under the car on Saturday to remove the oil cooler housing.
Before I drained the oil and coolant I wanted to find the best way to do
the job.  I couldn't see any way to remove the oil cooler without removing
other parts such as the exhaust manifold.  Since I didn't have the gaskets
for the manifold I decided to hold off.  

Does the exhaust manifold have to be removed to get the oil cooler out or
is there an easier way to do it?  Any help with this matter is greatly
appeciated.

Thanks,
