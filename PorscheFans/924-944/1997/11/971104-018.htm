It could be the DME relay. I don't know what should happen, but the DME
relay provides power to the DME when the car is turned on. Also check
the fuel pump relay.

The three main causes for this type of failure are:

1. Fuel pump relay
  Check by listening for the fuel pump after turning over engine

2. DME relay
   You can check power at the DME (under passenger carpet. check Haynes
manual for pin numbers. PS Never disconnect the DME while powered up.
3. reference sensor on the flywheel, but if it works sometimes I doubt
it's that.

PS when it finally starts does it start normally or rich???
