In keeping with tenor of some of our current debates, I will response
appropriately.

How can you possibly be so f**** stupid to give out such idiotic advice to
someone who's probably going to go out an blow up their transmission apart
trying this method?? Everyone knows, and I've already contacted a LOT of
PFans who say I'm correct, that going thru more shifts than necessary wears
away more metal than necessary.  We stop cars with brakes, not
transmissions!! Brake down, check the revs, shift from 5th to 2nd, and go. 
And I don't give a good g***d*** what Bondurant or anyone else says in
their stupid books.  

(Just a joke, Dan. Honest.  On a more reasonable note, I've observed that
equally good driving instructors will give differing opinions on the best
method.  Which can get frustrating because it means you can chewed out by 2
instructors in one day for trying to adopt their suggestions.  I used to
stick with sequential downshifts under hard braking to make sure I wasn't
over-revving, but focusing on hard braking with an eye on the tach, and
then shifting all the way down at the last second can also give you a
smooth entrance. As long as you put it in right gear.)
