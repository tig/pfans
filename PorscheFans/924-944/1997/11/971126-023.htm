Mr. McConnell asked about joining PCA.  I beieve that Sonoma is covered by
the Redwood Region.  Be aware that you can be a member of any Porsche Club
Region, while particpating in any other region's events.  I am a member of
Golden Gate Region, although where I live is covered by Diablo.  The Golden
Gate Region is heavily focused on AX and track events, but also has some
tours, rallyes and other types of events.  Redwood is also an excellent
region-  we go up there a few times to AX each year.  The key message to all
of you out there is JOIN.  Much of the info that you get on the list is a
result of club activities and sharing of experiences.

Also, be aware that there are two PCA Club races in the Bay area this weeken,
plus another Porsche group has an event at Laguna Seca.  Here are the detes:

Thanksgiving weekend:

Laguna Seca (Friday, Saturday and Sunday): Porsche Owners Club.  Time trial
at Laguna Seca.  I will be driving there on Friday.

Thunderhill Raceway Park (60 minutes north of Sacramento): PCA Club racing
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Practice and qualifying Fir. and Sat., racing
Sunday.  There will be some 962 cars there.  I'll probably drive on Saturday.

Following weekend:

Sears Point International Raceway: PCA Club racing again.

If you live in the area, come out and see the cars!!!
