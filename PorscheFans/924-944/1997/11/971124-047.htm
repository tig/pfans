Just a word of caution:

As many of you know, there was a recall regarding fuel lines in certain 951
cars.  This was several years ago.  Recently, my '87 car developed a leak at
the crimp on the fuel return line, up at the fuel rail.  The car had had the
recall work performed-- this is a different line.  Anyway, I checked in with
expert mechanic Ken Mack, here in the Bay Area, and he has seen numerous 951
cars with the same leak.  Apparently old age.  Note that for 1989, the
factory used a different type of line material.  This is very evident in my
'89 951.

So, Ken told me that the original line is one continuous unit from the fuel
rail all the way back to the tank area.  The replacement parts include two
pieces, which junction at a coupler right under the passenger seat.  To
install these parts, you have to lower (but not remove) the torsion bar
assembly, and remove the passenger-side wheel well inner plastic shroud.  In
the '89, the line has a junction just inside the left front wheel well--
apparently someone wised up in Zuff./Neckar.

Well, I didn't want a fire, so I bought a replacement front section, and a
coupler.  I also bought a flaring tool.  I carefully measured everything,
depressurized the system and cut the existing faulty line under the passenger
seat.  Then I made a flare and installed the new section.

Problem solved.

I have seen a lot of 944 and 951 cars at local dismantler Partsheaven that
have had fires-- not pretty.

If you have a leak, fix it, or have an expert like Ken Mack fix it.  Since I
have done some fuel system work before, I felt comfortable.  I always
disconnect the battery, work in a ventilated space, and have an extinguisher,
a catch basin, and a water bucket at the ready.  Most importantly, I have a
buddy ready (my wife) who can move quickly if something untoward occurs.

If for some reason you think your car missed the recall, they can give you
info in Reno.  Remember, the leak that I am describing is actually a
different hose (the return line).  A complete failure could spray a lot of
fuel into your hot engine compartment.  Just keep an eye (nose) out, and be
aware of the problems brought on by aging.
