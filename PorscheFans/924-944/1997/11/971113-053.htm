A number of people have asked about boost gauges to augment or replace 930 or
951 units.

A number of places sell the large VDO boost gauge that many have installed in
930 cars.  This unit reads in bar, and has a special tell-tale needle.  After
you read he max boost from your last measurement, you use a special key to
reset the tell-tale to zero.

VDO also makes a number of other boost gauges as a part of their automotive
line.  The units available in the U.S. all read in PSI.  Last Fall, I tried
to buy one in Germany that read in bar, but I got to the VDO shop in Munich
too late on a Friday afternoon and they were all out drinking at Octoberfest.
 So I went to join them.

Anyway, as far as I know, you can't get a unit that reads bar in the U.S.,
except for the 930 type mentioned above.

The best U.S. source which I have found for VDO gauges in this country is
Racer Wholesale in Georgia.  There are several different types and sizes, all
shown in their excellent catalog.  The one I have reads from 0 - 30 PSI.  My
car makes about 16 PSI at max. boost.  Obviously, when this occurs, the
factory gauge is burried at the 2 bar mark, and I have a smile on my face.

I mounted my gauge in a special plexiglass panel next to similar VDO oil and
water temp gauges in a spare heating/AC vent/bezel which I use on the track.
When I am not running a lot of track events, I reinstall the factory
vent/bezel to circulate more air.  (The area under my CD player is occupied
by an equalizer-- remember it is a Turbo S).

Anyway, if you want a great selection of VDO gauges, Racer Wholesale is a
good bet.

I paid less than $30.
