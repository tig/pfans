Hi All,

 If the 8V 944 N/A can do that, then what are the real limits of
> > the S/S2/T or the ..TS?

Talk to Jim Moder (moderj@email.kaiserslautern.army.mil) who ROUTINELY
runs his 951S at top speed (150+) on the Autobahn.

  One thing to remember about claims concerning our Porsches, is that 
according to German law, they must be able to AT LEAST equal what is 
claimed. 
  I own an 83 944 that I routinely run at 240 km/hr (~149 mph) on the 'bahn. 
Nothing special done to the engine, regular 163 bhp, with 16" wheels. 
I've had it up to 253 km/hr (~157 mph) on a nice long downhill stretch (~4 km) 
on A-6 between Enkenbach-Alsenborn and Kaiserslautern. 
  I also own a 1991 951 (# 211 out of a last year run of 240 cars) 
that I run on the 'bahn far in excess of 150 mph. Again, nothing 
special done to the engine, except for a K&N filter. On the flat, this 
car will do 280 km/hr (~174 mph), down the same hill on A-6 I have 
hit 300 km/hr (~186 mph) . HOW fast am I really going?? I have always 
thought that the Porsche speed-o-meters are on the optimistic side. 
However, I was running my 951 with a fellow PCA-Germany Region 
member in his 1997 911TT, and on A-5 right outside Franfurt Airport 
(BEAUTIFUL 4 lane road and flat as glass) and I got up to 280 km/hr. 
When we stopped, I asked him how fast I was going and he said 172 
mph.  BUT, again, is his speed-o-meter optimistic? Reading the many 
car mag tests, they almost always show Porsches to have optimistic 
readings. 
  ANYWAY you cut it though, these cars are a blast to drive, 
especially if you have an Autobahn nearby  : ^ }}!!
