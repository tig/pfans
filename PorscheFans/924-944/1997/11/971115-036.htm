Everyone's experience is different.  I owned an 85.5 for 6 years; bought it
with 26,000 miles and sold it with 105,000.  It was the most reliable, least
expensive (total cost  of ownership) car I ever owned.  I sold it earlier
this year at about the same mileage as the one you're looking at, so I can't
say how reliable it would have been with higher mileage, but I see a lot of
tag lines on emails on this list referencing very high mileage 944's.  Good
luck.
