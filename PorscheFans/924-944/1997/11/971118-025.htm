        Hi, its Sam again, ok so I got the header(2+3) re-rewelded
 2x so far with no avail. The first time the bolts didnt line up to
attach  to the head, now the 2nd time they line up well enough, but =

the part that attaches to the rest of the exhst. system will not line up.=

        The mechanic says it wont probably ever work again,
and that you cant mess with the other end(exst side) because that
is a fixed pipe. And if we were to bend it to fit, while under full boost=
,
it would snap in 2 pieces.
        $807.?? is way to much money, but as of right now
It might be the only way to go. (Already bought 2 other used manifolds
that both leaked, one place still hasnt sent my money back.)
        So if anyone knows of ANYONE that has a P-E-R-F-E-C-T
used pipe, please contact me.  My car is now sitting outside of the shop.=

                                                                :(
        My father said he wants to get it welded again, but the shop
that did it really doesnt want to mess with it anymore.
        Anyways, Please Help...
        Thanks for listening, and sorry 4 yelling
                      (Im just really upset!)
