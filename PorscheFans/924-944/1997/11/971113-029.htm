At the risk of wasting more bandwith, a partial point by point rebuttal is in
order:

Mr Kassam writes:

>The wastegate spring may be capable of holding in 1.5bar of boost, but, if
you connect the intake piping directly to the wastegate, the wastegate
is set to open at 0.2bar because of the diaphragm. 

Now you clairify this!   Apparently, based on the positive email I have
received, I was not the only one on the list that read your posting and
interpreted your "Remove all the electronic gismos..." to mean the complete
removal of the cycling valve without reconnecting any of the associated
plumbing.  Reconnecting the wastegate diaphragm to the intake tract was never
stated in your original post. 

>>This document states elsewhere that if there is electric power to the
cycling
>>valve, the charge pressure from line C (intercooler boost line) is vented
to
>>the intake side of the turbo, and there is high charging air pressure.
Based
>>on the intake manifold signal (boost or vacuum), the KLR uses square wave
>>signals to regulate the duty cycle of the cycling valve. 

>Is this not what I wrote in my article???<  

NO....you did not explain the entire procedure. From what you had written,
you would get much more than 0.2 bar because the line from the wastegate to
the intercooler pipe would never have been reconnected  !


>Now, as far as 0.2bar is concerned, try this.  Bypass your entire cycling
valve and hook the wastegate up to your intake pipe with the banjo bolt.
What boost do you get?  Now, you'll understand how this system works.<

Buddy I understand how this system works, and you might too...however, from
the way you wrote about it in your bandwith wasting drivel, few people on the
list could understand what you were saying. 

If your going to write multi-page technical dessertations, do some proof
reading before you send it off. 

> I've been in a 944T that has an electronic boost controller
and it produces full boost in 1st and 2nd.  If your theory is correct
or the book's theory for that matter, then how come my car won't produce
full boost in 1st and 2nd when the computer has NO control over the boost
because of my drilled cycling valve?  So, software mapping is out now.
Maybe it's flow restriction?  I'll buy that if I hadn't seen 15psi myself
in the EVC equipped car.  It still may be restriction based, I'll leave
that one for now, until I've done more testing.<How could that be? 

My racecar makes over 15psi in 1st and 2nd with the stock DME-KLR engine
management. How could that be? 15 psi is NOT full boost. I run WELL OVER 15
psi in 3rd, 4th and 5th. 

I have been doing my testing at the racetrack for the last 4 years. Where do
you do your testing?

>I'm sorry sir, I'm really restraining myself here.  I wrote in my article
that the factory Porsche system was WAY more advanced than its time if
you READ my article.  In this day and age, how can you expect a 1980's 
technology to be current?  While the system works fine, there are better
boost control methods available.  Have you ever tried an HKS EVC before?
Have you seen what it can do?  I have, I ran a 12.7 in the 1/4 mile with a
2.0L 4-banger that weighed in at 3200lbs.  A system like the one used in
my 944T would not have been able to bring in the required boost pressure
with the limited load on the engine in that car, it had to have an
electronic controller to do it.<

Farzaan, your really showing your ignorance here with the worthless
comparison of 1/4 drag strip times with the real world.  Reaction times, tire
adhesion, possible All Wheel Drive, and the willingness to beat the piss out
of your car for the launch equal 1/4 mile times. What was your terminal
speed? Any serious drag racer knows that terminal speed is the indicator of
horsepower on the dragstrip.  I have seen 2.0 liter, air cooled, carbureted
VW's  run 10 second 1/4 miles! 

>Ok, that's it, I'm not going to restrain myself.  You have quoted crap from
books above, most of it is 100% correct and is exactly what I wrote, just
in techno babble.  What is incorrect is your explanation of what was written.
I've cleared that up above.  I will never provide any information which I
deem to be made up or incorrect.  If I haven't personally tried it, I will
tell you just as I did about the wastegate shim.<

The corrections or as you call it "Crap" that I wrote was lifted all or in
part from the technical manuals written by the designers of these cars. These
manuals are designed for easy interpretation, and are required reading for
anyone that repairs these cars or wants to understant how the systems
operate. 

I guess you fashion yourself above all that. Even if you do know what your
talking about, your writing skills have a long way to go before you can offer
the same through and comprehensive journalism as the likes of Jim Pasha and
Ken Gross. The email I have received from appreciative list members validates
that statement. 

Maybe you can get Jim or Ken to proofread your material before you submit it
as fact to the list members?

Regards,

Steve


P.S. I don't intend to pepper this list with obligatory rubuttals everytime
Mr WOT comes back with more chatter on my original post. I believe everyone
is too busy to be required to wade through any more of this B.S.
