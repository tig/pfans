I have two questions for the experts as I re-install my oil cooler thermostat
housing on my 86 951.  Excuse the length, but the first one is fairly
detailed.

1.  When re-installing the housing, Technical Bulletin #3 in the Parts and
Reference Technical Catalog refers to two sealing O-rings that go on the
connecting pipe of the oil thermostat housing.  When I removed the housing I
found one  O-ring in the recess in the housing where the connecting pipe
lined up.  Where do the two O-rings go ?  I assume one goes in the slot on
the end of the connecting pipe.  I did not remove the connecting pipe (could
not easily get it out), so I don't know if there is an O-ring on the block
side of the connecting pipe.  Is that where the other one goes ?

2.  When re-installing the 1-4 exhaust manifold, how does the gasket for the
connection from the manifold to the crossover pipe stay in place ?  It's a
large compressible metal O-ring, and I can't see anyway to hold it in place
during re-installation... it just kind of sits there and doesn't fit into a
recess or anything.  Do I have the right part ?

TIA
