Insist on a genuine Porsche windshield.  There Is No Substitute. (tm). ;-)

Seriously, though.. the glass shop shouldn't care, but the insurance
company may balk.  Take your car to the dealer, and insist the insurance
company pay the bill.  You have the right to factory original parts, to
maintain the original safety parameters designed into the vehicle. 
Afermarket glass reduces the originality of the car, should you be
interested in maintaining resale value or keep it concours.  Serious
buyers look for matching factory glass all around.  My .02.

Re: Windshield replacement
	The last time I check, if your car has an air bag, Porsche used a special
laminated glass windshield. The special windshield sells for something like
$2700 for the part! Local glass shops usually use aftermarket glass, I think
a typical price of around $700-800 installed. I've been told by a friend of
mine in the insurance industry that all glass is made by three or four
different companies in the world. The only difference is in the gasket that
comes with the aftermarket glass, and who's mark up you pay for. I would
check around with local glass companies - find out who does that dealers
windshields? There is also a place called "Glass Suppliers,Inc",
1-800-421-1414, they have one for $256-$655,  they advertise in PANO. 

				Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
