I had mine, 89 951, to 270 ( about 168 mph ). There was still some left
unfortunately you run out of road very fast. I have found that there is
a loss in stability above 230kph ( 140mph ) with the lights popped up
that isn't there during the day. Not that you should run that fast at
night. I can't see how you can get 300 kph unless the rev limiter is
raised to another 500 rpm over APE chips. I have to agree with Farzaan,
a 951 doesn't 'tighten' up until you are above 160 kph ( 100 mph ).

<< Talk to Jim Moder (moderj@email.kaiserslautern.army.mil) who
ROUTINELY
 runs his 951S at top speed (150+) on the Autobahn. >>

I've had my chipped '86 951 pegged at 163 on the speedo.  This was after
timing it at indicated 80mph revealed 77.3 mph on the clock.  The motor
had
about 125k miles at the time.  Has 145k now.
