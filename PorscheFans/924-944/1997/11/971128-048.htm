Air Compressor / Tool Kit  Warranty book filled out, Also contains Maint.
History
Stamps,  Have any? Dealer Stamp #.

How many owners ? Listed ? Maintenance records show service mileage?
Low mileage Porsches should have a history easily traveled.  

Check the operation of the clutch close.  If the car has not driven much I
could see where a novice person can screw up a good shifting clutch.  
After a couple of blocks and getting it warm you should be able to shift if
very fluidly.  Mine had been replaced right befoe I got it, excellent
dealer mech.  Also need to look at cam seals for leaks, mine don't , but
had been replaced when the timing belt was done. (29K) Again dealer
service, all parts replaced, right.  Valve cover developed a slight dirt
collecting weep that hasn't came back since I cleaned it. When I bought
mine, it was not taken care of, like I would have.  


Things to also look for:

Check for balance in the drive train. I should be very smooth.  I can feel
all the way out to the tires.  Lock lug misplaced, RF out.

Check the inside sidewall of the tires for cracks and such.  Car sounds
great, I like mine lightly driven; not sitting, when I get something with
low miles.

Paint in good shape? Cassette and Glove box hinges intact?  Carpet perfect?

Turbo/S2 Fog Lenses/bulbs chipped or broken.   $300.00

Front Nose piece in Excellent condition (Rock chips minimum) $$$

Windshield Washer Tank leak? Fill it all the way up.

Retractable Headlight linkage  No bind, Smooth
  

Points to negotiate over with your seller.

The S2 is an outstanding example of the lineage, if not the best overall
!!.

Good luck,
Mike Mullins
90 S2 Cab.
