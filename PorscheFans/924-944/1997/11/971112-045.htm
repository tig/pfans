Howdy,

Just wanted to say congrats to the following people who are on this list for
taking home a trophy in the CACC Championship Regional autocross series:

A/S
1. Kerry Brown		944S		Dunlop SP8000 or SP4000???

A/SS
1. Patrick Ma			911TT		Bridegestone S-02
2. Tim Stark			944TS		BFG R1
3. Harry Dether		911 Carrera	BFG R1
4. Farzaan Kassam (yah!)	944TS		Dunlop SP8000

PAX
3. Wesley Shew		944S2		BFG R1

I think that's all the people on this list.  A special congratulations
should be given to Kerry Brown who has dived into this season in a manner
like I've never seen a rookie do.  He went to almost every event (at least
evey event I went to, he was there!).  He won more on consistency than
raw speed, but the golden rule of racing, to finish first, you have to
finish and that's what Kerry did.  Kerry's competition includes Stu
Rulka (check SCCA Nationals A/S to see how he placed!).  Stu didn't make
it to all the events, but Kerry should feel good to be placed higher than
him :)

Wes and Paul had an excellent battle in PAX with Wes edging Paul out by
about 6 pts, but Paul was on S-02 rubber almost the entire year.  Arnold
managed to squeeze in between Wes and Paul to take 4th, the last trophy
position in PAX in his Civic/Boxster combo.  Had Paul ran A/SS class, he
would have finished 2nd behind Patrick Ma.

Darren Foo, his first year in autocrossing managed to edge out some long-time
competitors like Rich Hoffman.  I believe he placed 7th in A/SS out of 10
cars.  Tim, Harry and Pat all did a very good job.  It's amazing when
someone really fast comes along how everyone elevates their level of driving
to try and catch the bugger!  I had an interesting year, should have been
2nd, but did my best on street tires and managed a decent 4th with a trophy,
which will make my sponsors happy.  When my sponsors are happy, I'm happy :)
Especially when I try and hit them up for karting money!

Farzaan,
2nd SCCA BP Northwest Region
4th CACC A/Superstock
8th PCA Class II (not bad for one event!) :)
