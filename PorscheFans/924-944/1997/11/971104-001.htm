Dear George(Hussey at AutoAtlanta)
Thank you for addressing my concerns.
 I had intended to call the company before writing to the digest however it
was a Saturday when I discovered these concerns and not being able to reach
Customer Service I vented my frustrations with the List.

They were gas shocks but I also could have had them shipped for less than
half that amount through another company.

I used your company primarily because of recomendations from the List. I do
not have a catalog.

I told the List that I would let them know the outcome after contacting
your company, so now I have done that.

Thank you,
