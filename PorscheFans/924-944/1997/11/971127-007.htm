On the 944S/2, oil "normally" seeps past the two black plastic plugs in 
the cam cover.  I say "normal" because my car does it, and my car is of 
course the centre of my automotive universe...

But seriously, there are o-rings behind these plugs which you (um, and 
I) can replace.  The plugs are retained from the inside by circlips. 
 Which means you have to take the cover off to do the work.  Which 
makes it a good time to replace the cam cover rubber gasket and the 
four round gaskets around the spark plug bores.  When and if you do 
this, use a little sealer on the new gasket at its four corners as they 
cross the bearing bridges -- these parts have a ribbing in the rubber 
and require a little extra help to seal around the sharp turns they 
take.  I use Loctite 574, but an RTV automotive sealer is fine as well.

The cam cover bolts are frequent targets of abuse because they look 
big.  In fact, the threads are M5 and go into fairly thin aluminum. 
 You may have broken yours flush with the aluminum.  If that's the 
case, I would try to back it out with, say, a pick.  Good luck,

Kevin
