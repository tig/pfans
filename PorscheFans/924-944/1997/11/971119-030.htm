Hmm, no flames intended here, but did Porsche drive the Turbo another
100,000 miles after Nelson Ledges or did they break it down to study the
motor?  There is no question that the 7 hours of race warmed up the
catalytic converter nicely.  Even if they ran a season with the car, I
feel the comparison is not valid as Porsche did not need the catalytic
converters to last for the long haul, nor did it care.  What is another
possible $700 (or however much a new cat costs) to a factory racing
project??  As a individual racing my car though, if faced with the choice
between putting $700 aside for another catalytic converter or a set of KMR
front solid upper motor mounts, I think I would remove the cat and install
the KMR's.
