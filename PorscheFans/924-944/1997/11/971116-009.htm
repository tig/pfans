These sound good. 1st and 2nd are like the S2, 3rd is about 5 mph higher
(which would be useful, because 3rd is a strong gear) and 4th is about
11-12 mph down (which would be great in an S2 because the engine does not
pull wellin 4th above 105 even flat out on a straight -- may as well be in
5th).  Have to admit that those ratios, plus the extra 26 mph, would make
the 968 a considerably better track car than the S2, at least on tracks
with long straights.  Although on the last track I ran, my S2 did seem to
hang on to a 968 in the straights, which was a pleasant surprise.

Not necessary. Thanks for the info. Sounds like a 968 trans in a S2 could
be a good thing. But a 968 trans in a 968 would be even better.
