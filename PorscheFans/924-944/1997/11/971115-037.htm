Gregor:

Interesting site on speedtraps.  Didn't know it existed.  Looked up my
town and county (Cambridge,Ohio/Guernsey County) and got a real kick out
of the description of the whole county being a speedtrap!  Of course,
that's not true so I had to add my $0.02 and send in a modification. 
Even told them where the real speedtraps were and that I bought our
Department new laser guns.  Mostly I just said that CPD has instructions
to just hang the radar and laser guns out the doughnut shop window and
track cars while washing the down those chocolate sprinkle covered cream
horns.  ;)  (anal retentive smiley face, but appropriately placed)

BTW gang, here in my town all officers have been told to only issue
warnings to speeding "water" cooled Porsches, everybody else get the
tickets.  One exception though, "air" cooled Porsche owners not only get
the ticket, but full body cavity searches as well.  A little payback for
all that crap about their REAL Porsches.  (just kidding of course)
