I just did 1/2 of my experiement.  With a K26-style turbo (Turbo S version
with larger hot side) and some Milledge chips, I get full boost (~1.1 bar) in
both first and second gears in my '87 951.

This car feels like it accelerates much faster than the '89 I own which has
the Autothority set-up (max. boost = .9 bar).  In my opinion, the best thing
about the car with the Milledge chips is the part-throttle response and
smooth onset of boost.  The car is remarkably autocrossable.

The true test for all of these cars is acceleration time between 4000 and
6000 rpm in third gear.  The cars are not meant for standing starts.  I will
conduct some comparison tests this weekend.

At the end of my experiement, a job interview, and a 120 mph run across the
Dumbarton bridge (SF Bay) my car died 1/2 mile from home.  Found a blown fuel
pump fuse.  I tried four new fuses, and disconnected the turbo water pump,
and the fuel tank sender, which are on the same fuse.  All four blew
immediately.  Now I have to troubleshoot the fuel pump.  I hate electrical
problems, but as I am an electrical engineer (by training-- marketing is my
profession) it could be worse.  I could have to pay someone else to do it.

Anyway, regarding the Milledge motor-equipped car I mentioned earlier: what a
neat car.  Jon worked on the engine in collaboration with Jerry Woods and
Dwight Mitchell, as the owner lives out here and Jon is in Boston.  It has
some 935 (clutch) and 962 parts, and a custom intercooler.  Its owner can
tell you all about its performance-- especially from 4000 - 6000 rpm.  Recall
that the car's original configuration was covered in Excellence by David
Coleman back in '95.  All of that performance stuff has been removed
(including HKS boost controller) in favor of Milledge's Motec stuff.

The thing was still on its stock '86 suspension when I drove it.  It tilted
up in the air like a speed boat under hard throttle.  The truly awesome thing
about it was its part throttle response-- it was autocrossable even with 435
bhp (from 2.5 litres!!!).  I want a motor like that. (Someday...)

By the way, I made friends with some of the guys from Weissach while they
were at Laguna supporting the factory GT1.  They will be back at Laguna for
the historics next August.  They are bringing ~30 cars, including the 917/30
from the museum.  Maybe a bunch of you guys from BC, Washington, Oregon, Utah
and other not too far away places could make a 951 caravan.  I could set-up
an awesome AX at Candlestick as a part of the weekend!  Then we could drink
brews with the guys from Weissach!  How about it Farzaan, Tom P., et al?
