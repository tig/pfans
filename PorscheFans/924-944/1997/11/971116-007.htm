If you buy from Porsche, you pay Porsche prices. :)

If it was the exact same part, I'm sure you would.

Yes, if they aren't 924-specific parts.

Check out the AutoAtlanta catalog, you can order it at www.autoatlanta.com.
It has parts numbers and price references for most parts. Examples:

Head gasket:     046 103 983A  $38.50
Piston ring set: 060 198 151   $89.50

I guess you could get these even cheaper if you took the numbers to a
VW/Audi-shop and bought the stuff there, since I'm pretty sure that these
parts numbers are VW/Audi ones. Just make sure the numbers are right.
