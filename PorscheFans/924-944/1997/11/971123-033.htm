Dear P-fans
	Last year I tried a 3.0 bar fuel pressure regulator on my '86 951, here are
my $0.02's worth.  My car is stock except for AutoThority V2.7 chips and a
test pipe. I noticed that the 3.0 bar reg increase Hp only at full throttle
-WOT. The engine also make a back fire sound only at about 3700 rpm's when
shiting at part throttle! The reg really did kill parts throttle performance
- a lot! it kind of felt like the cat/exhaust was clogged not allowing the
engine to rev up. I just happened to have a fuel/air ratio meter so I hooked
it up. I found that the 3.0 bar erg ran two to three LED's  richer than
stock! I don't remember what the ratio was - but it was way too rich. The 3.0
bar reg I got was a Bosch unit from a BMW E30 body, ie '86-91 325i(s) 6
cylinder model, cost about $60. 
	I ran my air flow meter again - with the 3.0 bar reg removed and the stock
951 one reinstalled. The meter indicated a perfect fuel burn right at "stoch"
14.7:1 - it held this reading almost to redline in each gear. Only at the
last few hundred rpm's did the meter indicate a (one more higher LED reading)
a richer mixture past "stoch". Just the way AutoThority designs their chips -
they richen the mixture the last 400 rpm's before redline so that the
operator shift gears - after all you are way past the torque peak at that
rpm!  I think that the higher fuel pressure might work on a stock car running
more boost - but on a car w/chips the injectors are already pulsing more duty
cycle than stock any way! My advise is do not waste your money on this
"Widget" ! 
	The only thing useful about installing the reg was I found ou that my fuel
hoses were starting to come apart - inner seam from outer seam. I replaced
the return fuel line to prevent a fire. 

					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
