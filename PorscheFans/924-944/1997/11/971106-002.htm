Gregor,

I too noticed the balance shaft belt whining after I installed mine a few
weeks ago.  Since the belt is new and it will stretch a bit I'm leaving it
alone for now.  I'll be retensioning both belts in a couple of weeks.  My
BS belt is currently at 2.8 (spec for a new BS belt being 3 +/- .3).  When
I was talking to the Service Mgr. at the dealer, I told him I didn't think
the BS belt tension was that critical.  He said it really isn't but to keep
something in mind.  If the belt jumps off or breaks, it can bind up in the
cam belt and break that one too and we all know what that means.  Just some
food for thought.

BTW, for those who are thinking of buying the tool and doing the tensioning
yourself - it is a piece of cake but takes a little patience.  The hardest
part was finding two people who agree on what the proper tension should be!
