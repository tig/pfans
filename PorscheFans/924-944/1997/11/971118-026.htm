Subject: Audi 2.0 ltr. in a 924?

Feloow Porschefans:

If the 2.0 ltr engine in my 924 is actually an Audi. Why do they
want so much more for the 924 parts, than if it was an Audi, or VW part?

For that matter if I went into a V.W. dealer and asked for engine
parts for a VW van. Would I get a better deal, than what I would pay for =
the exact same "Porsche" part?

Hello P-Fans
	Yes - parts prices do vary by franchise!  Volkswagen/Audi/Porsche.  A given
generic part (one that is available through VW-Audi-Porsche)  - the price
does vary on whether the part is bought through a Audi dealer or Volkswagen
dealer or a Porsche dealer. I know that Volkswagen's part price markup is
about 36%-38% depending on the part. For example engines have little mark up
% wise, but accsories & trim have more. Cost plus 35% equals the "customer's
price" or "list price". Now - Audi's list price is usually more around 42%
area. I do not know what Porsche's markup is - but I would guess it to be
close to Audi's since they usually share frachises. 	I know this because I
use to work for three VW Dealers. All things being equal - the same part
should cost less bought thru a VW dealer.  Now for the kicker - SOME dealers
do not charge the manufactor's list price - they charge MORE!  After all -
this is America - are you familiar with the phrase: manufactor's sugested
list price - your final price might be higher!    Some Dealers use a what is
called a "bump system". They will "bump" or "added markup" is the sugested
list price plus another 3-6% tacked on - for a greater profit margin!  Some
dealers even will charge 50 - 250% plus list on parts costing (costing the
dealer that is) under $100.  I worked at a dealer where we sold Volkswagens
and Subaru's - there was an Audi/Porsche dealer just 1/4 mile down the
street, a lot of their employees would purchase "generic" parts thru us to
avoid  Audi's higher price! 
	Volkswagen and Audi share parts distribution in the US and Canada. Porsche
does not! When you order a Porsche part it come from Porsche parts warehouse
in Nevada, but if you order a "genreric part" it come from VW/Audi parts
warehouse. The part price will depend on the Franchise or Dealer Make (Audi
or VW) and if they use a bump up system. 
	The part numbers are arrange in three groups of three digits: XXX-XXX-XXX.
Sometimes there are even a "letter" or one or two "digits" following the nine
digits, signifing a supersesion of that part ( ie: xxx-xxx-xxx-"C" or
xxx-xxx-xxx-"02"). The first three digits tell you for what model car the
part is for (or what the part was first designed for). The second group of
numbers - tell you what kind of part it is: ie, electrical, suspension,
ect..., see break down bellow. The last three digits are the specific number
of the part, followed by a "one or two digit number" or"letter" charactor,
designating the latest supersesion.
	How do you tell "what a generic part" is by the part number?  All parts
starting with a "N' or "999"-prefix, or "900"-prefix, or "000"-prefix, are
all available through a Volkswagen dealer.
