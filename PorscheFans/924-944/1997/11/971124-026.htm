Hi Guys
	A couple of list members wanted to know which air flow meter I used and how
to install it. I use a RB Racing  digital fuel/air ratio meter. RB Racing
does alot of land speed record motocycle stuff & serious hi-per hot rod
projects. The main thing I like about the meter is that the LED's are
calibrated for each particular set of operating conditions. The LED's are
also color-coded to let you know exactly what the engine is doing - after all
it is hard to Read & Drive at the same time! The meter reads from 17.1:1
(lean) all the way up to 12.1:1 (rich). The LED's progress from green - thru
yellow - to orange - and lastly to red LED's.  I know for instance that with
AutoThority's V2.7 Chips & a test pipe, that when I accelerate hard, the
meter shows the first orange (13.8:1), then the second orange LED (13.2:1)
glows once you are on full boost. Then the first red LED just starts to glow.
This meter, I think slow the opperator on the fly what the fuel mixture is by
color of the LED. You do not have to look at a chart or read the printed
scale on the gauge while your driving!  You can contact RB Racing for more
info at: 310-515-5831, they are located in Gardena, CA. 
	The meter installs fairly easy. I just hook it up temporary by building a
small electrical harness - power leads to the car's battery, and one wire to
the O2 sensor. I tapped into the O2 senor where the sensor plugs into the
egine main harness - to the rear of the intake manifold by the oil filler
cap. There is a three wire plug - round in shape. The two white wires are
power suply for the heating element - you want to tap into the Black wire -
O2 sensor feed. I used a "scotch-lock tape so I could latter remove it. I
just hook everthing up and route the harness  under the hood, by the battery,
around the passenger window/door. 

									Good Luck. Davidjalai
