I picked up a set of brake pads for my son's '89 951 at my local Porsche
dealer, and when I opened them up I noticed they did not have the brake
pad warning sensor wires that are currently on his installed pads.  The
part number for the fronts is 993-351-939-01, and they are Textar brand.
Is there another part number for pads that include the warning sensor
wires?  I don't want to install the pads I have if there are others that
are more suitable.

Another problem is the rear pads seemed overly expensive at a list of
$111.00.  They were part no 965-352-939-04.  I'm returning these because
it turns out the rear pads are still OK, but I thought the rear pads were
about half the price of the fronts.  What's the deal?

Thanks,
