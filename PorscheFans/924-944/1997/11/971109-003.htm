I make with my 951 85 on 205/55/16 225/50/16 on a very hot day in an Autobahn curve 165mph
or 264 km/h @6200 rpm. 169 mph on the speedo. I adjust my speedo every year.  Nothing
easier than that with the 951.the 951 s was tested with 167mph and the chipped with175mph
on the German Autobahn.The 944NA have had 143mph and the 944s 147mph on another test.
