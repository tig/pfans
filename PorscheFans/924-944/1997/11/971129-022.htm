  Sorry Steve and Kevin. I just looked at your responses within my e-mail 
enclosures after I sent the last message. Both of your inputs are very 
welcome too. Steve, I tried to find an EFI pressure gauge yesterday at the 
Turkey Rod Run at Daytona Speedway. No such luck. Some of the fuel injected 
Rods there had fuel pressure gauges mounted to the fuel rails, so I know 
they are out there. Of course, none of those car's owners were present so I 
could ask where they got theirs. I am going to try "Super Shops" next (for 
those of you who don't know what that is, let me sum it up with this: "Red 
Neck parts store for those who don't think their Mustang or Camero is fast 
enough thru Interstate traffic).
  As a side note to everyone, I saw an 83' 944 for sale at the show. Had 
about 150,000 on the OD. Inside was clean, motor was clean, and the paint 
job was impressive. Black on black. You could stand back 15 feet and still 
see your reflection clearly! The only problem was the front spoiler. Whoever 
did the paint and body work neglected to use proper materials to fix the 
road scuffs and digs. It looked like they just slapped some Bondo down there,
 sanded it, and went on their way. That fatal mistake ruined an otherwise 
beautiful car. The owner was asking $7900 for it. Needless to say, the car 
had very few nose prints on the windows....
  What he might have tried insted, was to have the spoiler send over to a 
shop that does remolding work with automotive ABS plastics. They can recast 
the part so it looks as good as new. I have seen it done. It is worth it. I 
plan to have mine done when I start on the body work on my 944 (when and if 
I can get the car to start and idle right, hot or cold). 
    

    Todd  :-) 

PS- No "nasty grams" from anyone in love with Super Shops. I grew up in 
Atlanta, so I guess I am a Red Neck too. I even think Jeff Foxworthy is 
really funny. Being one, I reserve the right to poke fun at them. I just 
happen to have a taste for German cars. Especially PORSCHEs!!!
