The top of the line and the highest rated detector is the Valentine One.  
It is wicked expensive, however ($399).  Personally, I use a Bel 855.  It 
detects all bands, and has an informative dot matrix display which will 
display safety warning broadcast messages (In the US) such as 
'construction ahead' 'high water' 'emergency vehicle in transit,' etc.  
Unfortunately, my state (Oregon) doesn't use the system yet.

Laser:  Usually by the time you detect it, you have been clocked, since
the laser beam is so narrow.  It doesn't scatter like radar. There is a
small chance you may pick up some reflections.  However, officers like to
target the headlights and licence plate.  Since the 944 has no exposed
headlights during the day, and has such a low frontal area you may have an
advantage if it takes the officer several tries to focus on your front
plate.  I bent my bracket so the plate angles towards the pavement
slightly in hopes of reducing the return laser reflection to the officer
(this is untested and unproven). 

Radar bands:  If there is traffic ahead of you, and instant on is being
used, you can react if you catch the reflections up ahead.  Some officers
make it easy and leave their guns on all the time.. you can detect them
two miles away.  Beware of moving radar (officer coming towards you in
opposite lane).  If you are alone on the road and a vehicle approaches,
slow until you are sure it is not a patrol car.. or you could be an 
instant on target.

I try to blend in with traffic instead of switching lanes and zipping
around unsafely.  You will be stopped radar or no.  Never let a police
officer see your brake lights.  They signal a reaction to speeding and
signal guilt.  I have passed many officers going over the limit, after
having downshifting to the next gear to slow without detection, or just
letting off the accelerator quickly.  If you are alone on the road you are
a sitting duck unless you can see in all directions.  Watch overpasses and
on/off ramps for hiding officers. 

The following website list speedtraps in locales throughout the United 
States, and reveals favorite hiding spots and activities of the local 
enforcers.  You might want to print some out before you depart:

I don't advocate speeding.  I do have the right to know when I am being
monitored, should I inadvertently violate a speed limit, or if I am
erronously issued a ticket.  The detector is a good reminder.
