Bob,

It probably wouldn't hurt anything.  However I have some info that might be
interesting.  The '89 944 2.7 liter engine had a higher pressure regulator.  It
was a 3.8 bar versus the 2.5 bar one the turbo had.  With this increased
pressure, the fuel pump was different (higher rated check valve), the pressure
damper was different, and the injectors had a different cross sectional
diameter.

While it seems a number of people put a 3.0 bar pressure regulator on their
cars.  I might be one someday.  You might want to look into how it affects
other parts of the fuel delivery system.  Especially how the pressure damper
handles the extra pressure.

And, if you do find out additional info, please post the list.
