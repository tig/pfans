If you look at the performance data and horsepower/torque for the three 
cars you should walk away with the impression that the 951 was a tick 
quicker.  This is true for strait line performance.  In particular, 0 - 
60 times.  There is a real advantage to having to shift only once (the 
Turbo needs only second gear to reach 60 mph).  True, you can meet 60 
with the 968, but again, according to the figures, you are too far up the 
tach to make useful power.

Here is an excerpt from the May, 1994 issue of Excellence:

....the usable torque of the 968 commences much earlier than the Turbo...

     "The numbers confirm the prediction.  The first generation 944 Turbo 
produced 243 pound-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm.  The more robust Turbo S 
yielded 250 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm.  The 968 peaks at 225 pound-feet at 
4,100 rpm.  On paper, it looks like the Turbos should outrun the 968 
quite handily.  But out on the open road, just the opposite is true.  
That's because the usable torque of the 968 commences much earlier than 
that of the Turbo, providing a source of thrust that is neither peaky nor 
momentary.  For example, as low as 1,000 rpm the 968 is producing 147 
pound-feet of torque versus a mere 117 for the 944 Turbo.  Thus, the 968 
enjoys a 25 percent gain over the Turbo in usable power."

The numbers say the Turbo is a bit faster, but that is on paper, or in a 
strait line.  Where the 968 picks up its accolades is in the "driving".  
Because the 968 torque curve is more robust and flatter than the Turbo, 
the 968 enjoys a real advantage when mixing it up in the twisties.  While 
the gearbox on the Turbo is well matched, the 968's 6 speed is precision 
tuned to work with the power band of the 968 engine and allows the driver 
to hook up with the road with exactly the power they need to move very 
quickly with far greater ease.  That ease of driving may not be too 
exciting when compared to the after burner ignition of the Turbo, but it 
gets the job done.

The 968's 6 speed also allows the driver to stretch the top end a bit 
over the series 1 Turbo (156 versus 152 mph).

The final showdown comes to a few other things.  You must take into 
consideration, tires, running condition, weather (we all know that cold 
air is the Turbo's friend), and of course, the operator.  However, if all 
things were equal, and on a anything but a strait line, my money would be 
on the 968, but not by too much
