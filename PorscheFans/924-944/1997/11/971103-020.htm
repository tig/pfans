I'm surprised there has been little comment about the pictures, only a few
emails have trickled into my box about it.  I still can't believe I put
them on the net!  I have been getting emails from JV fans who've done the
same thing, quite a few actually.  It took three bleach attempts to get it
that light (it's lighter in real life) and my head still hurts a bit when
I shower, probably turned my scalp into mush.  I plan on dying it again
before I head to Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix.  I just hope JV 
doesn't come up with a more wacky hair color like red or something!

I don't know if it helps with lap times, but for some reason, it really makes
you feel confident, probably because you assume that everyone is staring
at you everywhere you go :)

Every once in a while, every human being has to go out and do something
crazy and something different.  I'm sure Barry felt the same way when he
decided to go road racing, he just had to say "oh well" and dive in.  For
some reason, this gives some of the most satisfying times in a person's
life.

The hair looks pretty cool with a pair of Oakley Eyejackets on and I love
the look on elderly womens' faces, when they look over and wonder why this
freak is driving a Porsche!
