I will be getting mine today!  If you dare to match prices for the 6 
volume set, try White-Allen.  I just ordered the complete 944 set and the 
Turbo supplement (yes, the real paper workshop manual).  Their prices 
were as follows:

                    List $         Their Price
944 6 Volume set    $225           $179
Turbo Supplement     ???            $48

The list prices are suggested dealer list.  PCA members get that all 
important discount, but I think they will give 20% off to anyone that 
asks for it.  Great bunch of people and they really try hard.  I have no 
need for this, but I understand that Porsche Parts Express will drop ship 
if you sign up for it.

I also am the proud owner of the belt tensioner tool.  Costs were:

"The Tool" 9201     $461.55        $369.24
Calibration 9201/2  $28.89         $23.11
Flywheel lock 9206  $23.48         $18.78 
Belt Tension 9244   $43.85         $35.08

White-Allen is in Dayton, Ohio (937 291-6000), Dale or Dawn will help you 
get what you need.  There may be cheaper places to go to, but they 
deliver locally for free and and have been an invaluable source of 
support for me.

Post Script:

For all those interested, I have finished doing my first cam belt 
replacement, with success I might add.  I have a full complement of color 
pictures and will do a comprehensive write up on this procedure in the 
near future.  I would like to offer this at a small cost on CD ROM for 
everyone that is interested.  If this succeeds, I will expand this with 
additional volumes containing other service procedures.

I feel that the factory and Haynes service manuals are good guides, but 
lack the depth of detail for the "shade tree" mechanic.  I would like to 
include theory of operation, and a full blow by blow methodology to get 
the job done right.  I am not shooting for a supplemental guide, but 
rather a complete source that you can use for the particular service 
outlined.

Please be patient as I am a half time student working a full time job, 
but I feel this is an important mission for all 924/944968 owners.
