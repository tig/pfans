It would be a shame though, the car is in nice shape.

        Don't scrap it yet!  Just go to your local Porsche dealership with
the car's VIN number (it's in the windshield in my 951, so I'm assuming it's
in the same place on this 924) and they'll have a key cut for your exact
vehicle in a week.  You will need to bring your title or registration card
for proof of ownership though.
        I had to use the above procedure because I wanted a new key for my
car.   My original key's notches were wearing down smooth, but new, sharp
notches and grooves = 100% reliable locking and unlocking of vehicles.  You
can't have too much help on cold mornings!
