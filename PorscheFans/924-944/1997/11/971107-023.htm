What's even better than having a cop clock you at speed?  Use their
equipment without them there!  Some may have seen this, but here in
Germantown, the cops have this huge electronic/digital billboard that has a
radar attached to it.  It shows the Speed limit on one side, and shows YOUR
speed as you drive by it.  Its ususally hooked up to a patrol car, but
officers are around--they just set it up here and there to 'scare' you.....

So, NATURALLY as we saw the sign, my buddy looked over and gave me that look
of "How high can you make the sign read" ;)  To make a long story short, we
got it to where the speedometer read about 167/168.  (I have the 180mph
speedo, of course)  The radar sign indicated 162.  So it was after all 5mph
optomistic----but I'll take anything over 160 anyday!  

And since we were topping the car out, I went and got the camera---you know
the rest...
