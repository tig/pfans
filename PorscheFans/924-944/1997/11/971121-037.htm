Hi Jim,  welcome to the list.

While this may be in the faq nowadays (if not it probably should be). 
Most 944s make some belt noise.  I'd say 80% of the 944s I see at the
track have a distinct whirring noise associated with the belts.

I'm not saying your problem is belt noise, but there is a good
possibility.  When I changed the rollers my car made a very audbile
whizzing noise that increased in frequency when the rpms went up.  At
about 3000rpm the noise became indistiguishable from engine noise.  When
I changed my belts, my car still made this noise.

I feel the noise is coming from the balance shaft belt.  Either the
teeth of the belt are not fitting prefectly in with the pulleys.  Or the
teeth are rubbing against the idler pulley of the balance shaft.  The
idler pulley is suppose to be .5 mm from the lower belt half.  The noise
is either the belt hitting that idler pulley from underneath or it is
riding over the top of the idler pulley.

Funny thing if the belt is too loose it *could* be exagerating the noise
because the belt would be constantly hitting the idler pulley on its way
to the tensioning pulley.  But it is generally felt that the noise is
from overtightening the belts.

Even when my belts are at the proper tension, they make the
whirring/whizzing sound.

Anyone else care to comment?
