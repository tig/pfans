Hi P-fans! I'm a new subscriber to your list. I've been reading the archives
for a while and have gleaned some useful information. It's also been
refreshing  reading about others with the same interest ( and frustrations),
who understand why I would spend $2,000-$3,000  on  repairs for an "old car"!
I'm a salesman for Saturn so you can understand the mind-set  of most people
I deal with. BTW, if a Saturn beats a Porsche on a track, we're talking about
a sick , sick car. All I can say is I didn't write that commercial!
 My question is...Are there any Porsche organizations in the Houston area?
TIA.
My daily driver for the last 2 1/2 years is a 1985.5 944 NA (automatic)
Please don't laugh.<grin> I 'm  the second owner and it was perfect except
motor mounts when I bought it for $3,500. Untill recently I've just had to do
the usual stuff ( cam belt & tensioner ,  plastic gear and shaft for speedo
to odometer, etc.) Each has been a learning experience and many of the
questions/problems I've crossed I've have been discussed/solved in your list.
I wish I had found it earlier!  I 'm in the middle of replacing my power
steering rack tonight. I got it from Vertex for $269 rebuilt, compared with
$800 new. I stopped because when I got to the copper compression washers for
the p.s. lines, the local Porsche house had provided the wrong ones!
I also ordered new Boge front struts from Paragon Products, upon Porrschefans
submitters recommendations and was impressed with how my order was treated.
BTW, the $2000 repair I alluded to earlier was for a rubber transmission
dampner/flex bushing and it was a case of ignorance of my car and the
mechanic / shop I selected.Live and Learn!! I've used enough bandwidth
tonight  and will keep my comments about ongoing threads to my self, at least
for now!! Thanks again
