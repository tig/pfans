I had a similar problem with my lights about 2 months ago.  It only
happened once and I found out the problem pretty quick.  My headlights
wouldn't even pop up.  The first thing I did was wiggle the ignition key
and they started working.  That night I sprayed some graphite in there and
worked it back and forth and haven't had anymore problems.
