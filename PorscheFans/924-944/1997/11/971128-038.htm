   I have a 1987 944 which has the larger offset phone dials.  The '87 and
later 944's had a 52.3 mm offset and the earlier ones were 23mm.   
   I have been looking for a set of 16 inch wheels  so I can have a set of
wheels for track and autocross use.   Anyway, I have someone(out of state)
that has a set of 16" phone dials off an '84 928.  Unfortunately, the inside
of the wheel does not have the offset stamped on it, and I not sure if what
he is measuring is accurate.  From what I have read, the 928's had the larger
52 mm offset that would fit the later 944.  (the 911 phone dials fit the
early 944's) Is this correct?  I have the part number which is
928.361.016.00.  The local Porsche dealer was of no help and did not have any
info as to the offset of the wheel.
  I need help.  Has anyone used 928 offset wheels on their 944?  Do the 928's
fit the later model 944 with the 52 mm offset?   Does anyone have a set of
16" wheels with 52 mm offset for sale.

Thanks for the help;
