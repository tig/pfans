Subject: '84 944 lights

1. For the last two nights the headlights have been behaving strangely.
About 5 times now, the lights went out, stayed out for about 4 seconds
and came back on. No flickering or anything, just pitch black and then
full lights again. This was accompanied by a relay-type click. When the
lights went off they did not recess, they stayed up. So the headlight
relay is unlikely to be the culprit (it cycles the motor and the lights
would have gone down). No recent changes other than a little lubricant
on the light raising assembly this weekend.


Please remember this is an '84, so the fog lamps are almost an
independent circuit -- they do not shut off on high beam. TIA.

Dear Surya & P-Fans

	Check your X-Relay located inside the fuse box. The X-Relay switches off all
accessories during starting/cranking of the engine. This relay can  switch
off the head lights and the wipers, defroster, blower motor, ect...  Or the
ignition key contacts ( the electrical switch part) could be worn. Next time
this happens try wiggling the ignition key. The switch bellow the ignition
key tumbler could be worn. Last but not least - check the fuse for corrosion
- but this is unlikely since the high and low beams are on separate fuses. it
is not a bad idea to replace all the fuses in a older car ever few years. the
fuse blades will develop corrosion over time. replacement is the best
preventive maintenance.

						GOOD LUCK
