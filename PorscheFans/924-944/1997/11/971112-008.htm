just bought a 1988 944 Turbo S.  50,000 miles, ruby-champagne color, and in
great condition (except for the drivers seat).  We've been very active in
the local BMW club for over 10 years, and (of course), we just joined the
Porsche Club.  Our main 'sport' with these cars has been drivers schools,
with our home track being Watkins Glen, and we've been to Mid-Ohio,
Mosport, Lime Rock......    I do most car maintenance myself.

>Being new to Porsche's, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience
with 944 Turbo's at Drivers Schools.  What are common failure modes,
suggested rim sizes (to hold the new BFG R1's), is synthetic oil
recommended in the engine? transmission? differential?  Best engine Chip?
..........   I'm currently going through the archives, but so far I've only
gone back to October.  There's alot of info there.

I've been driving my '87 turbo at Sebring for the past 3 years. The car has
110,000 miles. Failures at the track have been 0. I use 15/50 Mobil 1 and
overfill it about 1/2 quart before a drivers ed. Very critical in these
engines to make sure the oil level is always on or above the mark. My
differential fluid is Swepco, don't know what my mechanic has in the
transmission, but it shifts smoothly and I've had no problems with it.
Brake pads should be a track compound (I use Hawk blue pads and like them).
Brakes are flushed before every event and I use ATE Super Blue brake fluid.
Most Turbo S drivers use a second set of stock wheels for the track (7's &
9's) with 225's on the front and 245's on the rear. Some use 9" wheels all
around with 245's on all corners. As far as chips go, the consensus on this
list seems to be AutoThority stage II chips, but Weltmeister has a
following also. The Weltmeister chips require shims in the wastegate, and
this is a lot of work. The Autothority chips require a modified banjo bolt
which is very easy to replace.

These cars have a number of typical problems. If you read the FAQ you will
see that there are some things that seem to fail in just about all of them.
In my experience, however, these failures have not been at the track. Very
few 951's fail to finish an event. In that regard, they are pretty
bulletproof. Just my experience and opinion.

Mike
