Having just completed a motor mount job (84 944), I thought I=92d share some
experiences.  First of all, I am pleased to say that the job was not as
hard as I feared.  Perhaps I had read enough horror stories that I was
prepared for the worst.  I think there were two reasons that the job was
easy (relatively):

1.  I used an engine puller to suspend the engine (instead of the jack
under the oil pan or the hooks or ropes or cables suspended from
boards/shock towers).  I realize that that many do not have an engine
puller, but I believe the ease of my job was due to the ability to lift the
engine as high as necessary to gain adequate clearances.  With the engine
puller, one does not need to drop the cross member very far to gain the
necessary clearance, so it is not necessary (as some have reported) to
unbolt the control arms and risk screwing up the alignment.  In fact, the
next time I do this job (several years from now, I expect), I think I will
try to do it without lowering the cross member at all (and the associated
removal of the sway bar) and just do it by raising the engine.  In my case,
it only took a few minutes for each discreet step (remove old mounting
bolts, remove old mount, insert new mount, insert new bolts) of the
"replacement" operation.  After reading of PorscheFans struggling for hours
with a single mounting bolt, I think the greater clearance gained by an
engine puller is the big difference.
2.  I only changed the right mount.  On my car, the right mount was clearly
no good (only 55mm in height, hardened rubber with cracks).  The left mount
looked fine =8570mm height, soft rubber, no cracks.  After seeing up close
the distance between the exhaust and the right mount, I can see why it
fails sooner.  Why only change one mount?  It=92s not the $80 saved, but
rather because the one-mount-job is much easier.  If you only change the
right mount, you do not need to undo the steering input shaft to the
steering rack.  I would think that this would be a knuckle buster.  And
what are the odds of getting it back on in the correct orientation?
Furthermore, by only doing one side, I did not need to completely unbolt
the cross member on the left side.  I just loosened it (and the lower nut
on the left side motor mount) enough to allow the right side of the cross
member to drop.  In this way, the location of the cross member was more
closely preserved so that the installation of the right mount was easier.
My conclusion:  I=92d only change the left mount if it fails either the
visual or "60mm-height" inspections described in the shop manual and
previous PFan postings. =20

Now, if my left mount fails within the next year, I=92ll write back so the
purists among you can get your chance to laugh at me at that time.
