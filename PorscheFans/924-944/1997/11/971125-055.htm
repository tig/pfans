Well, what can I say?  I have been betrayed and violated.  I'm totally
disgusted and I'm mad as hell.  Why?  Because I've just been f*#ked over
by Porsche dealer Rick Hill Imports, Inc. of Kingsport, Tennessee.

I flew all the way from Seattle to Tennessee on Monday to pick up my
supposedly pristine, "the cleanest we've every seen," low mileage '89 944
Turbo, only to find out the car was a piece of $#!+.  I knew within 5
seconds of inspecting the car that I wasn't going to buy it, because it
was that bad.  Here's just a small sample of the unmentioned items that
Rick Hill Imports neglected to tell me about the car:

-  The dash had many large 5-6" cracks in it.  Of course they were
conveniently covered by one of those cheesy dash protectors in the photos
they sent.  When I asked them about the dash on the phone the salesman
told me, "I lifted the cover and didn't see any cracks."  Well, I guess =
he
must have been "temporarily unsighted" at the time.

-  The tires were all worn well below the wear bars and were totally
illegal.  They told me it would "need tires soon, but there's plenty of
tread to make it back to Seattle."  No way I'd risk it.

-  All the brake rotors had huge ridge lines and were in need of =
immediate
replacement.

-  The factory forged wheels had been painted using spray can paint and
they looked horrible.  There were runs in the paint and big spots where
the silver metallic hadn't mixed properly.  Very disgusting looking, and
conveniently shot from a far distance in the pictures so you couldn't
really tell anything about them.

-  The right hand door had been spot repainted and it was a horrible
match.  Of course the salesman disavowed any knowledge of this and acted
shocked when I told him.  I actually believe he didn't know as he was an
ignorant SOB like all the other "good ol' country boys" I met at Rick
Hill.  You know the kind... they'd sell their mother to make a sale.

-  All the linen colored carpets were faded almost white.

-  The exhaust system was a B&B with full catalytic converter bypass.
Selling a car in this condition is a federal offense and I believe it is
punishable by up to a $10,000 fine.  I'm going to tell the Tennessee EPA
about that...

I guess the thing that really pissed me off about the whole affair was I
had the car "checked out" (ha, what a joke)  by an independent shop in =
the
area prior to flying down.  Mark Finley, the owner of the shop("Rezoom"),
was listed on the Porsche Club of America web site as the Membership
Contact for the Wilderness Trail Region.  I figured if I couldn't trust a
PCA member, who could I trust (hint: the answer is "nobody").  He gave =
the
car a glowing report.  His exact words were "It is beautiful."  He told =
me
it ran fantastic and that the brake rotors were all nice and smooth, the
interior was gorgeous, etc, etc.  What a fool I was.  I actually thought =
I
could trust him.  Ten to one he was on the take from Rick Hill Imports,
who probably figured that if I flew down from Seattle I wouldn't leave
empty handed.  How wrong they were!

Originally, I was going to pay $17,900 for the car, and would have had it
been what they made it out to be.  This was their "bottom line price."
After I pointed out all the problems the sales manager asked me what it
would take to get me into that "Porsh."  I said I was't interested at any
price.  He said "how about $16,500 and we'll put a set of tires on?"  I
said "no thanks" and got on the phone with Delta ASAP to reschedule my
return flight.  Delta, BTW, was a lifesaver.  The agent listened to my
horror tale and somehow managed to re book my flight without any charges.
At first she quoted me $854 because I was on a special holiday fare!

So, here I am back in Seattle with no Porsche and no prospects of one.  =
My
belief that most people are honest is shot and I'm over $400 lighter in
the wallet.  I'm a whole lot smarter though!

Moral:  Do NOT trust anyone!  Not even a genuine Porsche dealer.  Hey,
maybe that should be "especially a Porsche dealer."  Anyway, I'm going to
look into filing a formal complaint with PCNA.  Rick Hill Imports, Inc.
does not deserve to sell "Porsh," and they don't deserve to sell Porsche
either.
