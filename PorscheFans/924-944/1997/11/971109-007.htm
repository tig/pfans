This is a highly contested subject.  Ideally, you could have your oil 
tested at periodic intervals to determine the best change period, but 
that is ridiculous for the average owner to do.

So much depends on how you drive, and where you drive your car, that 
there is no easy answer.  For most of us, 3,000 mile intervals for 
normally aspirated cars is probably a bit excessive.  However, driving 
conditions and style can change all of that.  3,000 mile, 3 month 
intervals are good insurance for engine life.  That is, it will not hurt.

If your car has been using synthetic oil and does not leak, stick with it 
if you like.  For normally aspirated cars that are not used for track 
events or rough duty, conventional oil is fine, especially if you use a 
3,000 mile, or 3 month interval.

There are some problems associated with cars that have been running on 
conventional oils and then switching to synthetic.  Oil seals and gaskets 
seem to spontaneously leak when introduced to synthetic oils after 
running conventional oil.

Although synthetic oil is more expensive, I harbor the opinion that the 
3,000 mile interval is a good thing.  If you do this yourself, and it is 
easy to do if not a bit messy, you have the opportunity to do regular 
under the car inspections.  This is a good way to spot trouble before it 
blooms into something bad.
