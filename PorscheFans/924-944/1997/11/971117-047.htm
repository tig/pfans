Just thought I'd come back to the list with two comments/updates and more
questions. Thanks in advance for putting up with this long post...


Hood shocks: easy on my early '85 944 with the non-flush windshield. After 
reading all the warnings I thought I'd need several stout fellows and a 
replacement windscreen.


Speedometer/odometer: still isn't moving. Since I had the left front tire 
off, I did get to examine how the speedo cable enters the wheel assembly from 
behind. The cable came all the way out through the bearing/grease cap and had
a C- or E-clip on it as expected. It turned normally when I rotated the wheel
by hand, but no response on the meters. My mechanic had indicated that the
cable can sometimes fail due to stress at the point where it first enters the,
uhm, spindle? axle? - right behind the wheel assembly, but at the time I 
misunderstood what he was referring to.

Next weekend I'll have a chance to remove the instrument cluster again and get 
someone to turn the wheel while I confirm/deny that the other end of the 
speedo cable reacts appropriately.


Heater controls: Still stuck on. I poked my head under the dash, but couldn't
identify the connections Barry Lenoble mentioned in an EMail message. This
is in part because I found something interesting in the engine compartment...

Just passenger-side of dead center at the top of the firewall, engine
compartment-side I found a T-shape with tubes that I thought might be the 
heater control valve -- one line goes off to a cylinder with a rounded end
mounted just inside the battery, right up under the windshield (what is 
this?);
I think the other line from the top of the T runs over to the large round
object just behind the brake fluid resevoir - this is the power brake booster, 
right? These tan/brown lines are both a couple mm in interior diameter, maybe
1/8". Must be vacuum lines, right?

Anyway, the interesting bit was the black line that ran from the bottom of he 
T-shape to a rubber boot lower on the firewall. This line had apparently made 
like shrink tubing -- it was kinked up in many places, and for several inches 
it had melted and fused into a solid plastic line. While I was fiddling with 
it, the solid section broke. Seemed like this was probably a bad thing, 
whether or no it had to do with the heat problem.

Since it was obviously broken I started tugging at both ends to see how easy
it would be to replace. That's when I pulled one fragment out of the T-shape, 
followed by the sound of a former vacuum sucking in air... Oddly enough, my 
brakes feel a little mushy now :^}  Guess I've got a brake bleeding ahead of 
me.

So the question is, was this the vacuum line that ultimately connects to the 
climate controls in the center console? Would the condition I found it in 
account for the lack of control over the temperature? Should I still be
pulling out the center console to check for cable connections to the sliders?


This weekend: speedo saga, new fog lights, fog light relay mods, non-working
horn, power antenna, greasing headlight lifter linkage...

Thanks VERY much,
--Steve.
