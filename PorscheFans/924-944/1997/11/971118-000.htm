Been there, done that.

When push came the shove, I too, had a long discussion with my insurance 
company about windshields.  Here is the story I got...

I have an 89 Turbo with air bags.  To work with those bags, you require a 
special windshield.  I suspect that you have air bags as well.  The 
original glass, if I am not mistaken, is made by Sekurit with a special 
plastic lining on the inside designed to keep glass fragments from 
cutting the air bags.  I suppose it would work in a similar fashion for 
one's face.

The dealer list on that glass is in the neighborhood of $2500.00.  My 
insurance carrier, which is State Farm, would not pay that amount as they 
have a network of glass installation shops that "buy" into State Farm's 
price plan.  To do this, the installation company must use "generic" 
glass in place of the original.

Now, my insurance company would cheerfully agree to use OEM glass from my 
dealer if I would cheerfully be willing to pay the difference between 
"generic" glass and OEM.  When I checked the cost difference, I was 
astounded.  The delta was $2,000!

Bent on getting OEM glass I placed a few calls around town to get the 
scoop.  The installer, with hand on heart, swore up and down, that this 
glass was manufactured by Sekurit and was the same glass as OEM, only 
arrived in the States not bearing the Porsche name.

Swearing up and down myself, I pressed on with my quest, but everything I 
turned up agreed with the statement from the installer.  Reluctantly I 
agreed to have this glass installed, but I made arrangements to have the 
installer do this in my home garage.

You may want to consider this arrangement.  I would request the best 
installer they have and have them do it in your garage so you can watch, 
and in my case, I even helped.

Some things you need to watch out for are the front forward pillars.  The 
vinyl trim on these tends to be easily cut when they hack out the old 
windshield and its sealer.  I have seen this before, so I forewarned my 
installer and avoided sliced interior panels.  Those panels are glued on 
my car and are not easily removed, so beware!  You should also cover the 
interior of the car with a sheet when it comes time to pull the glass.  
The urethane sealant has to be cut off and gets everywhere.  Talk to the 
installer and make him feel like your friend!  This goes a long way to 
getting the best service possible. I found out that my installer owns and 
restores old hot rods.  We got to be quite chummy after he had a chance 
to blather about his loves and desires.

In the end I am quite satisfied with the glass and the workmanship.  I 
spent two hours watching, helping, and talking, but it was worth the 
time.  I had a shop do another 944 once before and they butchered the car 
while I waited in a distant room.

Good luck with your windshield,
