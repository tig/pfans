A couple of weeks ago you might remember I posted that my gas mileage 
had dropped 2 to 3 mpg and I wondered if a missing oil cap o-ring 
might have been the reason. Well after a full tank with a new o-ring 
gas mileage is back to normal.:-) I estimate right at a 3 mpg loss 
without the o-ring. Im not surprised that it made some difference but 
that is more than I expected. I'm just glad it was nothing serious.

There's been some discussion about the whooshing sound you sometimes 
hear when you open the gas cap. I've noticed that Exxon gas always 
produces that whoosh. Tonight before I filled up the car it was 
idling poorly. I thought that was odd because it had been running so 
well. Went to Exxon, popped the cork on the tank...whoosh...filled up,
 now purrs like a kitten. Guess it needed to be burped. I usually 
dont use Exxon but did tonight to get an accurate check on the 
mileage. Has anyone else heard of Spur. Every car(4) that I've run on 
Spur gas has run better on it than any other gas. Its the cheapest in 
town. It's neighbors Shell and Texaco are 8-9 cents higher. Go figure.
 And it doesn't whoosh!
