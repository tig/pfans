Joe,

No, I was thinking of having an e-mail registry for the early series in
addition to remaining on the PF list.  I should have made that clear.  Some
of us with the early cars have found that our questions to the list don't
always seem to get responded to as well as some of the other stuff, and
the thought was that by having an additional audience that was
specifically interested in the early 944 series there might be a greater
likelihood of some response, even if it was "I don't know."

Sorry for the confusion.

James
