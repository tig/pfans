I have always regarded them as high price so I don't order anything from 
them, but I like their catalog.

As for shocks, the best place (price and service) this side of the Milky 
Way is Paragon Products (800 200-9366).  Jason is first class and goes 
out of his way to insure 100% satisfaction.  Shipping (UPS ground) is 
free and if you need it faster he has credited me for the difference
