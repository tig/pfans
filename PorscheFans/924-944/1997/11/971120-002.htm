I recently dealt with State Farm on a windshield for a non-P-car. My
impression was that State Farm has a separate company called Lynx in
Crystal River, Florida that processes all glass claims. Lynx has
pre-negotiated pricing with certain shops all over the country. In a couple
of minutes they will tell you what they will pay, and either authorize a
repair at one of these places in which case you pay $0 out of pocket or cut
a check to you for the same amount they would have paid, in which case you
are on your own. I took the second option and, went to my Land Rover dealer
and ended up coughing up a couple hundred $ extra.

Another interesting thing about State Farm is that they lump glass coverage
under comprehensive and the same deductibles applies, which is why I carry
a $0 deductible.  $$$$$ PITA.

And in NJ, they only pay $14/day for a loaner car up to $450 for collision
repair. $14 gets you nothing from any of the major car rental companies.

I guess I don't really like State Farm:(

Oh yeah, P-car content. I drive my P-car infrequently. However I cannot use
a trickle charger. I don't want the battery to get drained and am
considering a cutoff switch. I am told that there is a cutoff switch that
allows a couple of amps to get thru, thus preventing my radio and engine
management computer from resetting. Any experience or recommendations? I am
looking at 2 weeks-2 months between use in the winter months.
