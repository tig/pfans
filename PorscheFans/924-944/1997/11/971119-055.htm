Yeah, Kelly Moss thinks installing spherical bearings in Fabcar arms is 
such a good idea, they offer it as a product.  Or is it the other way 
round?  Hmmm...

The Delrin bushings are fine.  I use them in my own Fabcar arms, and 
there really is very little if any performance gain to be had by 
replacing them with spherical bearings.

The Fabcar arms are wonderful parts, but I would not leap to the 
conclusion that you need them to go racing.  I would first check the 
condition and age of the arms you have.  If they are in good condition 
and have, say, 50,000 miles or less on them, I wouldn't be in a hurry 
to replace them.

Porsche Motorsport also offers an improved version of the stock 
aluminum arm for competition use.  However, to my knowledge its only 
improvement is that it replaces the all-around ring groove in the ball 
stem with a one-side-only groove, like 911's have alway had.  This 
basically leave more meat in the stem and lessens the chance for a 
stress-related failure there.  I don't think the part offers any 
improvement in tolerance of misalignment, as would be an issue with a 
car that is seriously lowered.
