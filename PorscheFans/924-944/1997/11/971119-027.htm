heard that is is a good idea to remove the catalytic converter to avoid
burning it up. I understand that it builds up tremendous heat from
extended runs...

If the converter is faulty then maybe...  Porsche ran the Turbos with cats
(the 951 was the first car Porsche designed from the start with cats) at
Nelson Ledges etc (I think the Nelson Ledges race is/was a 7 hour race)
without burning the cat up, so I really think 30 minutes won't hurt it.
Ifthe car is running richer than it should then maybe there would be a
problem, but it was designed for high speed so...  
Somebody always has an excuse to modify this or change that, some guys I
know in Georgia say they rebuild their 944 engine after every race they
run to avoid a main bearing failure due  to insufficient oiling at high
revs.  The point is, run it and if it breaks it probably needed a rebuild
anyway.
