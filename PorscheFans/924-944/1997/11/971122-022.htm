Apparently,  what came standard and what was optional on the 
Turbo S is difficult to answer, based on this and other question I've seen
discussed on this list.   I'm looking at the original window sticker from my
'88 Turbo S (Wow!  $50K new!  I paid $15,500 8 years and 32,000 miles
later.).  Mine is not one of the original Silver Rose models, but rather a
later '88 in Marachino Red with the "Turbo S Option Package."  

According to the sticker, the Package includes:
-4 cyl. 2.5 liter 247 HP w/ larger turbocharger
-Sport chassis
-7Jx16 wheels with 225/50VR16 Tires, front
-9Jx16 wheels with 245/45VR16 Tires, rear
-Anti-lock brake system
-Limited Slip Differential
-All Cloth Seats  (but they're NOT; they're VINYL -- excuse me, Leatherette
-- with 
                          cloth inserts.  Why does a $50,000 car have vinyl
seats?)
-Cloth Door Panels (once again, they're NOT; they're VINYL, er... I mean
Leatherette.
                              Is Leatherette fake vinyl?  If so, it's very
good -- looks just like                             
                              the real thing!)
-Full Power Seats
-Split rear seats
-Rear window wiper
-Headlight washers
-Protective Side Moldings
-Hi Fi Sound System  (but NO EQUALIZER on mine, contrary to posts I've 
                                 seen that this is standard the Turbo S)
-Special Interior    (whatever that means!!!)

The Turbo S Option Package cost $5510.

My car doesn't have what I consider the Sport Seats, which I believe have
side bolsters significantly larger than the standard seats.  Neither does the
Silver Rose Turbo S pictured in the 1988 Car and Driver write-up.  I know of
at least one 89 
Turbo S that was purchased new with optional Sport Seats.
