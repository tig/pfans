You are quite right that the "automatic belt tensioner" is nothing of the
sort, it is solely for setting the tension for maintenance purposes and as
such is not capable of applying "new" belt tension, though the factory manual
makes no mention of this, which may be why some failures happen, through
shops using this when they should use the tool. That being said, many cars
use similar devices to pick up the slack as a maintenance procedure. The
porsche design seems to have a lot of potential for friction to counter the
effect of the spring due to high levels of surface area contacting the moving
parts. My volvo has a similar device which is much simpler, a strong spring
and 2 parts connecting it to the tension roller. There is even a rubber plug
so you can loosen the securing bolt to take up the slack and then retighten
it without even removing the cover. My point (at last) is this. Most cars
that use this device seem to use the same tension that this thing applies for
 a new belt, but then expect retension much sooner, the volvo at 600 miles.
It seems that this device could be used in this way, but it is risky if you
don't have good belt intuition, as you put it. I am wondering though, when
you measured the 1.8 p9201 units from the tensioning device, was it clean an
moving freely, and was it locked down when you measured it? If it was not
clamped down, the tension from the measuring tool might give a false reading.
If it was both locked down and known to be moving freely, I guess I will have
to throw in the towel and by the guage, as 1.8 seems way to low even for a
maintenance tension.
