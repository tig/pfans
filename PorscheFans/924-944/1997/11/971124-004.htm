I have always heard that it is not good to keep the clutch engaged for 
extended periods.  I see this all the time, and when I get to teach 
someone how to drive a clutch, I discourage it, with only a few 
exceptions.

The "rule of thumb" that I use is, never engage the clutch more than 5 
seconds at a time.  Exceptions would be rare situations where safety is 
involved.

The theory is, and it is only a theory as far as I know, that depressing 
the clutch pedal pulls the throw out bearing backwards.  This pulls pack 
on the flywheel, which pulls the crank shaft back.  This adds a lateral 
load on all the crank bearings that were not designed to handle that load 
for extended periods.

This make sense to me, so I would not keep the clutch pedal down for any 
longer than is required as it will do no harm to wait in neutral.

As for the 2nd gear starts, lugging the engine is one thing, however, if 
you finds that you have to slip the clutch to do it, then the extra heat 
will translate into extra clutch wear.

If you ever get the chance to replace the clutch in your car yourself, do 
it.  It will foster a greater appreciation for clutch usage.
