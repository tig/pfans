The sole purpose of classes like ITE or SP is to allow people to "race".
These are not National classes and never will be. There will likely be
people in faster cars, both Porsche and non-Porsche. There are very few
performance rules. Essentially, if you had a GT1 911 you could run it. You
are running these classes to get track time. You may end up "racing" with an
ITS car or the like. Although they may not be in your class, it's racing non
the less.  Winning in ITE or SP may very well mean that you have a faster
car, not necessarily that your driving ability is any better than anyone
else. If you want to compete in a national class in your Porsche you'll need
to go GT-1, GT-2 ...etc. or a production class such as E Production.
