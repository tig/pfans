Dear Jim,

Sports seats were not an extra on the Limited Edition car you have.
I have one of the actual Porsche Technic books for the Silver Rose.
Comfort seats were fitted. Most people I have known with Rose's have
thought about getting a second set of Sports seats. But you'd have to
get them made up.
The Burgundy 88 material is over 100pounds per metre and fades with age.
You'd have to do the whole car to match. Your call.

The beam from the flush fit lamps is pathetic. A lot of Carrera 924 GT's
in the UK have been fitted with them. Also since your car is one of the
lowest mileage Roses on the planet, you'd have to be a Philistine, not
to keep it original.
