I also am experiencing very annoying squeal from my brand new pads and
rotors(textar),and not only squeal, but a cruchy kind of sound kind of like
a rock stuck between the pad and the rotor. I find that if I heat up the
brakes by dragging them lightly while on the gas that I reduce the squeal.
And sometimes they are just silent. It seems to vary day to day. I'm
thinking of trying some non oem pads, since they seem to be cheaper.
Also, has anyone had any experience with changing the brake bias valve to
favor the rear brakes a bit more. It seems like the fronts are doing too
much of the work, and I can lock the front right too easily. I've seen the
valves advertised on the Windward web page(http://windward-perf.com)
