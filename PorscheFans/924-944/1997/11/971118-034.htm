I called Barrier Motors, who is one of the local Porsche dealers in the
Seattle area, and they told me that the special Sekurit laminated glass
(with the plastic layer exposed on the cockpit side) is no longer
supplied by Porsche.  

According to the Barrier parts guy, Porsche decided that it was no
better at protecting inflated airbags when broken than the standard
replacement windshield (which is also laminated, by the way, but the
plastic layer is not exposed).  It scratched easily and was very
expensive.  

The current Sekurit replacement is much less expensive--list price is
around $440.  Installed, the price is about double that figure.

Based upon a recommendation from a local Pfan, I made an appointment
with a local place that will replace the glass in my own garage (while I
watch).
