<< Do they provide enough warning in today's age of "instant on?"
 
 If so, what's the favorite of those list members that use one?
 
 Thanks, >>


The radar detector is not a radar shield.  Your best defense is your head and
eyes.  Nose and ears don't help much, but with instant on, if you see them
first, it'll be EXTREMELY difficult for them to clock you before you slow
down.  

That said:  Valentine one.  It's expensive, but there is no match.  The new
version now has Ka range comperable to the X and K band range, so it'll pick
up instant on (uses Ka) over a mile away (unlike my older version, which only
has a Ka range of like 1/3 mile or something, which is within thier range.
 Other detecters have ranges about half of the Valentine one).  The other
great thing is that it tells you from which direction the signal is coming
from ,and how many signals you're picking up.

Call them at thier 800 number and they'll send you copies of the Car and
Driver tests.
