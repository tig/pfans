The strangest thing happened to me about 30 minutes ago.  I was on the
way home through some unfamiliar twisties in a neighborhood when I
experienced something that I didn't think 944's ever did.  I was exiting
a spirited 2nd gear 4500 rpm right hander when the back end started
drifting out.  I remember thinking, 'Nah, couldn't be....these things
always understeer, the front end plows a ways then you keep going' so I
kept my foot in the gas, but the back end got REALLY outside and I let
off the gas (lift throttle oversteer?) and there I was at 50mph sliding
sideways toward the next corner, I countersteered, but to little to late
I guess because I completed a beautiful 270 degree spin through that
next corner and ended up in the middle of the road facing 90 degrees off
of where I originally was heading.  I sat there perplexed for a second
thinking 'That didn't just happen'  but all the tire smoke pretty much
proved that it did.  Anyway, I pulled away still perplexed by the first
case of what I thought mostly happened to horsepower-laden vehicles. 
Ok, I'm definately going to a PCA track day to further explore this in a
safer environment, but to the racers out there, Does a normally
aspirated 944 have the horsepower to overcome the 225's on the rear, or
did that lift throttle do it?  It's also possible, in retrospect, that
the sprinklers were on in that neighborhood (all you northerners are
probably amazed that we still have to water our lawns here), I suppose I
could have missed seeing the water and just tossed down the road on wet
pavement.  It was fun, but I don't think I want to do it again, NO, I'm
sure I don't.  Wish I had a video of it though.  :)   I pushed my
Porsche beyond a limit, either it's limits or the road conditions, but
in either event, I screwed up and it didn't cost me a dime.  What can I
say, God must drive a Porsche too, or I'm just really really damn
lucky.  :)

BTW, Jim  She is quietly reviewing all resumes at her leisure.  She
makes a great screwdriver holder and will serve someone nicely as
another bottomless money pit, but at least this one keeps you warm at
night.  She says she really likes the picture you sent of yourself in a
G-string, but you really didn't have to.  She thinks the porsche tattoo
on you buttocks looks great too.  :)
