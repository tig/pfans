OK, porschefans, here is one someone must know the answer to. I have the 944
factory manual which covers most of my 924S needs, except the interior, which
they expect you to get the 924 set for. Don't think so. The 924S has the
early 944/924 interior. I have decided that that a/c knob sitting there
between the gauges looks way too ugly, especially considering how nice it
should look with 3 gauges. (I'm thinking voltmeter) 
Question: what is the procedure for removing the upper part of the console
housing the gauges.  I took out the two screws, but it makes little
difference. Parts catalogs show it as a seperate piece which seems like it
could come off without disturbing the lower part. For anyone considering the
same changes, the a/c control is all electric, and under those big knobs it
looks exactly like old inner/outer knob shafts from older type car stereos,
and it looks like it could easily mount with a standard size hole/nut, just
like radios used to. The switch is not nearly as large as the knobs would sugg
est, so I expect to mount it to the left of the lighter, using some nice
replacement radio knobs. I will save all the old stuff in case some future
owner wants it original again. I doubt they will, as it should look MUCH
cooler.
