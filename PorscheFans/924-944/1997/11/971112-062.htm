Does anyone which way an '83 944 starter is supposed to spin? Clockwise 
or counter-clockwise? I just bought a new starter for my 944 (they said it 
was counter-clockwise rotating) OK - I take their word for as I have no clue. 
After I installed it I went to start the car and it sounded like it was rotating 
the engine backwards! The engine would turn a few times then come to a 
noisy halt. After talking to the place where I got it from, they said that it was 
the right starter. We even verified numbers from the bosch starter I 
removed. So, I tried to start it once more - bad move. It did the same thing 
only this time, when I turned off the ignition and removed the key, the starter 
kept going! It ran for about a minute before I could get the negative battery 
cable disconnected.   And there was a strange smell and gurgling coming 
from my battery! Did I fry it? Is this the correct starter?  Is the starter just 
bad out of the box? Can I make the seller replace my battery? One thought 
was that the leads were reversed but this would be impossible as the 
connection posts are different sizes -  would'nt it?

Any help greatly apreciated!

Thanks in advance.
