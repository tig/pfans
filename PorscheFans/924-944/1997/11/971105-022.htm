Things for sale:

I'm reposting in case the server was down:

1. APE Stage II chips for Turbo S w/K&N air filter and choice of 1bar or 1.1bar
   boost bolt - US$200.

2. Pioneer/Premier M88 CD deck pre-outs only.  If you don't know what this
   deck is, you probably can't afford it or wouldn't want to pay the price
   for it :)  Offers please.  This deck has some history, it won an IASCA
   251-500watt competition in my first Talon back in 1993.  It was shown in
   an issue of Auto Sound and Security.  I'll throw in the fibre optic cable
   with the deck to hook up a changer.

Congratulations to Darren Foo for moving up to an 89 944 Turbo from his
87 944 Turbo!

So, now our group has:
Me        89 944 Turbo
Paul      89 944 Turbo
Darren    89 944 Turbo
Lou       89 944 Turbo
Tim       88 944 Turbo S
Wes       91 944 S2
Alex      95 968 (sweet color and sweet looking car, I'm gonna have to
                  turbocharge one of these things one day and make it
                  mine!)

Tim is actually putting his car up for sale to take on photography (???).
It is a USA model 88 944 Turbo S, silver/golden colored exterior with
black leather interior, the big factory stereo, 80,000 miles, APE Stage II
chips.  The car has recently been heavily serviced, new rack, new water
pump and belts, (3000 miles ago), has turbo cup clutch, and a head gasket
done just a few months ago.  The car grinds a bit going into 2nd if you are
hard on it.  He will likely ask somewhere around C$22,000 or US$15,000.  The
car has seen 3 track days.

I guess you can contact me at fkassam@direct.ca and I can pass more info
to you or give you his number.

Farzaan.
