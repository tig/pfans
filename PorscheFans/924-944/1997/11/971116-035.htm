Racer X says:
<Hey guys is it possible to replace a rear main oil seal and overhaul a
<trans in 88 951 in 8 hours? INTERSPORT of Vienna VA did and now there
<are problems with the clutch but they say they did the job right. I had
<the car check somewhere else and they say the clutch assembley is loose.
<I am getting vibrations in the clutch. Is there any danger in driving
<the car in this stage? What do you guys think????

Racer X:

Only drive it as far as back to INTERSPORT and get them to fix it.  Better
yet, tow it.  That's a lot of heavy metal spinning around in there, and if
it's loose, those relatively small bolts holding it to the flywheel may
shear.  I've seen clutch and torque converter explosions from my drag racing
days.  Don't want to have you go through that fate.  My .02.
