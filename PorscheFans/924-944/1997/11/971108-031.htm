Jeff and list,

        I have an '86 951 with the plastic gas tank (isn't that what all
turbo's came with?).  I believe Jeff's tank may be metal, but I'm not sure.
I also have a gas smell/leak somewhere, and while a leak in my tank is a
distinct possibility, I don't think it's as plausible because plastic
doesn't really corrode.  My tank will leak only if I fill it up all the way
to the top, and I can avoid gas fumes if I only fill up the car to like
2/3-full and maybe 3/4-full if I'm lucky.  Anyway, when I observe the leak,
gasoline streams into a puddle that forms on the ground by the inside of the
right rear wheel.  Since I can probably deduce that the leak is close to the
top, and only a few inches away from the inside of the right rear wheel, can
I assume it's probably a leak in the hose that connects the tank to the
filler/cap assembly?  I'm thinking a clamp at either end of this hose may
have loosened or something?  Can anyone with more experience with the tank
and its hose attachments (Jeff?) provide me with more insight on this
matter?  Does anyone else have any ideas?  TIA!
