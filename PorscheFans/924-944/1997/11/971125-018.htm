Hi.  Regarding your message to 924-944 about possible mechanical failures
of suspension components causing spins etc.  Entropy gets into everything,
machine or biological eventually.  You mentioned that your car had 130k
miles at the time it contacted the wall when your wife lost control but
you could not understand why she lost control.  It may be that there was
something in the road which she did not see but did hit, there could have
been a patch of moisture, a driver error, a mechanical failure.  
If we begin to look for gremlins everywhere, I'm certain we can find a
few, but I wouldn't worry about it.  Keep your car in the best condition
possible, do your walk-around every morning before starting, and I don't
think you'll have a problem.  Please note that if you are concerned about
mechanical failure of a particular system then I would suggest rebuilding
that system with new parts whenever it begins to cause sleeplessness and
anxiety.
No 60 Minutes reports please for "Unintended Braking" or some such
nonsense.

Dana
