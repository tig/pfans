Adjusting the valves on my 78 924 a while back always proved to be a
frustrating ordeal, but as the number of times I adjusted them increased,my
ability did as well--(and I learned a few tricks along the way)

-1) make sure the engine is warm-the first few times I adjusted them, the
car was cool,and when I was done, the valves continued to click-I was
convinced I need a new head-but then I got smart and actually read the
haynes manual BEFORE I adjusted them and it worked great after that!-the
hotter the engine, the better,It gets almost intolerable ( the heat) but it
makes for a better adjustment

-2) a long regular 3mm works ok as long as you can tolerate it slapping
every turn (youll understand when you adjust them)

-3)you can get a 3mm from a good automotive tool supply co (Snap-on,mac,etc
or one of the many mail order places usually carry the1/4 in
socket--Automotion,Performance,etc)

-4)this may sound silly,but make sure the allen recieving end of the lifter
is facing the drivers side of the car (I have spent too much time fishing
with the allen wrench,only to find that I was at the wrong end) the screw
is tapered to take up the slack,so one hole is higher than the other,the
higher end recieves the allen.

-5)turn the engine at the crankshaft,not the camshaft(and dont forget and
leave the rachet attached to the crank) I think you know why I mentioned
this!
 
-6)use go-no go type feeler guages,the help eliminate the guesswork
hope I could be of some assistance,
