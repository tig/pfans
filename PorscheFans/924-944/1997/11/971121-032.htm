The idea about lifting off the throttle in a 944 is better stated as: don't
lift off the throttle quickly, all the way, when the rear wheels need the
traction.  Some judicious lifting can be used to throttle-modulate thru a
turn, If you over-cook a corner, the 944 is very nice about tucking the
rear wheels back in line if you lift smoothly.  In a pinch, throw in a
little opposite-lock to pick up traction.  944s will oversteer, just like
any rear-wheel rear car.  They're just a little quicker to forgive you if
you provide the right input.

-- Nick (chronic throttle-on oversteer and spin out idiot on exits; don't
follow too closely)
