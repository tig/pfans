I went out to start my '79 924 today (lots of snow, I wanted to move
before I got plowed in (again)).  It started OK, but as soon as I went to
release the parking brake I noticed something strange.  Normally, the
tendency of the lever is to drop down, but this time the tendency was to
stay up.  In fact, the first time I tried, the lever kept "creeping" back
up.  I worked it a couple of times and managed to get it to rest on the
button (it wouldn't stay all the way down).  The car could move OK.

Next interesting thing: I went to stop and noticed that the brake pedal
was very hard.  Braking worked just fine, but pedal response was more like
I'd expect - before it was a little spongy and weak.  Again, actual
braking ability seemed to be unaffected.

Later in the day, I started the car again and worked the parking brake
again.  Then, while not moving and in neutral, I pushed on the brake
pedal.  It responded exactly as normal.  But as soon as the car was
moving, in gear or not, it got hard again and stayed that way.

My best guess is that the brake master cylinder or booster is going/gone. 
That shouldn't affect braking, right?  I just have to apply more force to
stop.  I ask this because I have a 210-mile drive home tomorrow that, one
way or another, I'm going to take.

Thanks.
