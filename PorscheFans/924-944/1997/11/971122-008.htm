I picked up the car yesterday from Manhattan Motorcars.  They had kept
the car for almost two weeks from the date of purchase going over
everything carefully.  I made quite a pest of myself with 'phone calls
and faxes passing on suggestions from PorscheFans about what areas to
check on a Turbo that has seen so little use.  

The dealer seemed genuinely sincere about making sure everything about
the car was right and I drove away feeling very satisfied.  I am
scheduled to return the car at 2,500 miles to readjust the timing belt.
At that time, the dealer will replace the tach with a back-ordered unit
since the boost gauge is stuck.  They will also replace the fuel
gauge/sender unit which is not reading accurately, although this may
correct itself after a few refuelings.

It turns out the car has a very sophisticated after-market stereo system
installed by the first owner.  Not my thing, but the younger mechanics
were quite effusive about it.  The radio/cassette unit was a removable
Sony that replaced the original "Reno" radio and was either not
delivered by the first owner or mislaid.  The dealer installed a new
Alpine unit with detachable face plate, remote control and CD changer
control (for a remote unit if I ever want to add one) at no charge.  It
does sound nice.

After thinking seriously about putting my S in storage and preserving it
as a "museum piece", I decided "Naw, this car deserves to be driven". 
The shakedown drive was from Manhattan to Newport, about 200 miles,
mostly on I-95 I'm sad to say.  However, I did detour on a nice open
stretch of Route 1 from Westerly to Saunderstown.  What a wonderful car
to drive! No problems at all and I was impressed by how the car planted
itself on the pavement in a sweeper at 120 mph.

Next week I will take a longer trip to northern Maine by way of Lake
Winnepesaki.  My three year old son will join me.  Austin lives in
California and already is a car fanatic (ever since he figured out the
TV remote, he surfs the channels for motor races.  He likes the midgets
the most now, but I am sure this is a phase he will out-grow.  When they
flip over, he shouts "Oh-oh").  I think he'll approve of the 951S.

PS  The Fisher Price Model 79750 booster seat, rated for children who
are between 30 and 60 pounds and 37 and 50 inches tall, fits the rear
seat of a 944 very well.  At $60 it is an attractive alternative to the
Porsche booster seat. JEF
