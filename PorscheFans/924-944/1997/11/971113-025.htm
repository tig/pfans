Thank you John Pohl for writing (YELLING) what some of us have been thinking
about "list server etiquette" lately. It would appear that for the past
couple of days, there have been too many flames, too many silly "he said -
they said" arguments and far too much wasted bandwidth.

For others, like me, I think it has even different effects.  For example, I
posted to today a reply, and my advice regarding changing oil cooler seals.
In fact, I sent it privately YESTERDAY to Michael who had the original
question several days ago - not TODAY. Why?

With all the arguments and attacks lately, I was reluctant that someone
would flame me for posting improper advice or by mis-naming a
"techno-gizmo". How many others have read a post, have something really
valuable to contribute - and didn't for fear that they would become "toast"
from a flaming thread??? Come on, I know you're out there....

The point here is - we all lost as no information was posted by those who
might have some knowledge to share...  And frankly, I don't really care if
it  "scientifically correct"... I learn a lot from this list - and yes,
especially from long posts like Farzaan's - who took the time to explain to
dummies like me, the principles of Turbo charging.... The point here is, he
took the time out to author those posts - and sorta got personally flamed
for doing it...  Does that want to make me post to this list?   Nope, no
way, not on your life....

For me, you bet I'm still learning. And I'll try to share my limited
knowledge when and where I can with others. And I find it valuable to have
constructive comments back.  And I enjoy reading the posts. And I enjoy
reading constructive debates. I don't enjoy reading responses where people
personally attacked and publicly humiliated by other members.

And, in reality,  we all suffer - as other members sometimes with good
information don't get involved out of "fear of flames".

Stepping down off my soapbox.....
