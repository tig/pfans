In reference to the top spped posts of late, I have had the oppurtunity to
calibrate my speedo with the assistance of an un-named California Highway
Patrol officer.
We tested this two ways, we calibrated the spped at 70, 80 and 90 mph. using
the cruise control. The tested radar spped was 68, 77, 89. Therefore, it is
my assumption that when I was tracked at 164mph on a very flat road with no
wind for or against, that I really was going that fast. Down here in Orange
County Ca., we have what is called the Orange County Autobahn, it is actually
a toll road that was built a few years ago that is about 10 miles long. The
thing is, no-one ver uses it. So us sportcar enthusiasts can quite often be
seen out there testing our machines. I have played with Dodge Vipers, 911
twin turbos, Celica twin turbos, 300 zx twins, and even an ocasional vette.
The 944 I did this in is an 87 944s w/ 120,000 miles on it. I have done
nothing to it to upgrade it. So anyone saying that these cars cannot hit
these sppeds is wrong.
