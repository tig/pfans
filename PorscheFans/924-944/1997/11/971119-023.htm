PFans:

I recently purchased an '88 951 and shortly thereafter the brake squeal
became unbearable. I replaced all the pads with Textar's (oem) and all
four rotors but I actually have worse squeal now after the replacements.
I've purchased different pads to try and will probably file the edges
but was just wondering if this is normal for 951's as my previous 924S
never had a problem with squeal? 

I also have considerable road wander when driving streets with ruts but
on the interstate or flat streets the car tracks fine. Is the road
wander an issue of the wider and unmatched (in width) 7" & 9" rims? Does
rubber type come into play here? I've replaced the front wheel bearings
but it had no effect. The ball joints didn't "seem" especially loose
when I pried on them. Any other ideas? 

TIA

Dear Jeff & P-Fans
	First, brake squeal is caused by the brake pad moving or vibrating in the
pad carrier.  You could try to use a lube (anti-seize, applied to the back of
the pad, the side that faces the caliper - not the rotor face!). I think
Porsche sells a gummy patch, that has an adhesive side to the back of the
brake pad's backing plate.  You can also buy these isolation pads from any
good autoparts store, cut to fit your barke pads. You might also try to slot
the pads to prevent the pads from glazing the rotors inturn vaibrating the
pad - and you know the rest. 

					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
