Probably true...but also keep in mind that, historically, Porsche has been
very conservative with horsepower and performance figures. It's not
entirely unlikely that your car could exceed 130 MPH under the right
conditions.

It's easy enough to figure speed using gear ratios, rolling radius, and
your tachometer; if you doubt your speedometer make a note of RPM at
various speeds and then do the math.
