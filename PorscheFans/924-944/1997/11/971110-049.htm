I've found a really nice 1978 Porsche 924.

The owner said that it has a rebuilt clutch, and a fresh engine.
The only thing is the key was lost, and it has been sitting in the garage=
 for a couple of years. I guess the condition of the engine, and transmit=
ion doesn't bother me as it's a good deal, and I have a spare engine.

To get to the point how do you get the ignition switch out of the car, =
or is there a way of getting a key made for it?

If it turns out to be too much trouble, I may just use the car for parts.=
 It would be a shame though, the car is in nice shape.

Any advice, or tech help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
