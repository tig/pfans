Hi Bart,
1. Most likely a cambox gasket is leaking.
2. A new gasket is in order. If I remember rightly these need to be
fitted dry. ( Someone with a manual correct me if I'm wrong )
3. I had one of these go at the beginning of the year. More annoying
than anything else, BUT the leaking oil will leak on to other rubber
bits and perish them. *Your oil filter housing gasket and the rubber in
the steering rack may have been contacted by the oil too. Check your
belts for signs of any oil, there shouldn't be but a 15 minute check is
much cheaper than a $1500 bill. I had to replace my swaybay bushes at
the same time. Make sure you don't run low on oil and you are still
getting good oil pressure.

If you pop your hood and start your engine you should be able to trace
the flow of oil easily enough. I hope this helps.

Richard.

From: Herring, Bart

After spending last night tracking down a few minor problems on my '88
951S, I noticed what appears to be an oil leak in the area of the #1
cylinder.  I am uncertain of the origin of the leak, but it is
definitely oil.  A small pool has gathered next to the oil filter in the
large allen/hex-type fastener just next to the oil filter.  It appears
the origin is above the #1 cylinder exhaust port.  The oil runs past
this point and past the oil filter to its final destination onto the
floor of my garage.  I checked the dipstick and the oil level was OK so
it appears to be a slow leak but a leak nonetheless.  Checked the oil
filter for proper torque and it was OK.
1.	Where might the oil be leaking?
2.	What about possible fixes?
3.	How serious?
Any/all suggestions greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Bart H.  88 951S
