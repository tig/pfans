>Your way wrong here Farzaan, boost regulation on the 951 is controlled by char
>ge pressure action on the wastegate diaphragm. The wastegate spring in the
>951 is capable of allowing boost pressure in excess of 1.5 bar ( 2.5
>absolute).  

The wastegate spring may be capable of holding in 1.5bar of boost, but, if
you connect the intake piping directly to the wastegate, the wastegate
is set to open at 0.2bar because of the diaphragm.  Let me say one thing,
I really hate it when someone takes something from a book and tells me
I'm wrong in public without testing it themselves.  Disconnect the power
to the cycling valve, what boost do you get?  0.2bar or 1.5bar?  My money
is on 0.2bar.  So, either your book is wrong or you are misinterpreting
what they mean.  What they likely mean is, if you disconnect the pressure
signal to the wastegate, so the diaphragm sees 0bar and goes into
infinity boost, the wastgate is capable of handling 1.5bar before the door
finally opens from the pressure inside the exhaust housing.

>Quoting from publication WKD 491 321, 944 Turbo Information Technik, page 33:
>If there is no electric power on the cycling valve, opening R (return flow)

Above, you claim that it will do 1.5bar and then here, you quote exactly
what I wrote in different words!  0.2bar is all you're gonna get my friend.

>This document states elsewhere that if there is electric power to the cycling

Is this not what I wrote in my article???

Did you read anything I wrote in the three huge articles???  If you don't
have any signal coming from the intake piping to the wastegate, the wastgate
will allow as much boost pressure to build up until either happens:

1. The pressure in the exhaust housing forces the door open (I estimated 40psi
   required for this)
2. The overboost circuit kicks in and cuts fuel
3. The engine blows to a million pieces.

Now, as far as 0.2bar is concerned, try this.  Bypass your entire cycling
valve and hook the wastegate up to your intake pipe with the banjo bolt.
What boost do you get?  Now, you'll understand how this system works.

I'm sorry sir, once again, this is something that is written and not
tested.  I've been in a 944T that has an electronic boost controller
and it produces full boost in 1st and 2nd.  If your theory is correct
or the book's theory for that matter, then how come my car won't produce
full boost in 1st and 2nd when the computer has NO control over the boost
because of my drilled cycling valve?  So, software mapping is out now.
Maybe it's flow restriction?  I'll buy that if I hadn't seen 15psi myself
in the EVC equipped car.  It still may be restriction based, I'll leave
that one for now, until I've done more testing.

>You also make equally erroneous statements about Porsche's boost control

> Hmm.....lets see....the 993 twin turbo, the current Audi turbo's, SAAB
>turbo's all use that same system only updated to current computer technology
>and tailored for each engine's individual characteristics.

I'm sorry sir, I'm really restraining myself here.  I wrote in my article
that the factory Porsche system was WAY more advanced than its time if
you READ my article.  In this day and age, how can you expect a 1980's 
technology to be current?  While the system works fine, there are better
boost control methods available.  Have you ever tried an HKS EVC before?
Have you seen what it can do?  I have, I ran a 12.7 in the 1/4 mile with a
2.0L 4-banger that weighed in at 3200lbs.  A system like the one used in
my 944T would not have been able to bring in the required boost pressure
with the limited load on the engine in that car, it had to have an
electronic controller to do it.

Ok, that's it, I'm not going to restrain myself.  You have quoted crap from
books above, most of it is 100% correct and is exactly what I wrote, just
in techno babble.  What is incorrect is your explanation of what was written.
I've cleared that up above.  I will never provide any information which I
deem to be made up or incorrect.  If I haven't personally tried it, I will
tell you just as I did about the wastegate shim.

>This is not meant to flame Mr WOT, but to offer the list members correct
>information and a better understanding of these awsome cars.

Unfortunately, you did nothing of that sort.  I did not take it as a flame,
your information is correct, but your understanding is not.  Hopefully,
you will read my article more carefully in the future.

Farzaan.
