Need electrical help:

1.  I have the Charleston radio in my car and unfortunately, when I bought
the car, the manual wasn't there.  Can someone please tell me how to set
the clock?  I figured it once when I first bought it but that was a year
ago and I didn't write it down.

2.  The hazard light switch has been pushed out of its opening.  Any easy
ways to set it back flush with the panel as it should be?

3.  The #1 button on the clock that allows you to set it isn't working.
The clock works, I just can't access it to change the time.  Could the
contact on the #1 button be dirty?  How do I go about cleaning it?

4.  The AC switch (snowflake) is giving me problems also.  AC works fine
when I can get the switch to stay on.  I'm assuming either the contacts or
dirty or the switch itself is going bad.  Same as #3, how do I get to it
easily?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Not major problems but enough to
drive me crazy.

TIA,

Roxanne
