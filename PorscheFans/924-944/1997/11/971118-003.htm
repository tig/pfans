2 weeks ago I had my windshield replaced. No problems, no cost. Turn 13 at
Bridgehampton (RIP?) took it, a small price to pay for the days of fun I've
had there. Back to the glass. I told my company (All-State) a rock was
kicked up (true) and cracked my windshield, I have full glass and want it
replaced with FACTORY GLASS. To my surprise and no fighting, they agreed,
and waved the deductable if I used their guy. He came to my house and
replaced it in 2 hours with Sekurite (sp?) ie original equipment. He said
their cost was about $1400.00.
Probably selling the car soon, but the next owner gets to look through nice,
spotless, factory glass.
