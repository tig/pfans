Hello Matt,

> I am preparing for my first club race in less than three weeks, and

Good for you. Do you have everything else done? Please give us
the write up of the race. 

> realize that my control arms probably aren't up to the task.  The car is

For now, given that you don't want to spend big bucks, just use 
a stock, rebuilt control arm. Call European Dynamic Technologies.
Their number is in Pano and Excellence. A rebuilt control arm is
$149. If you don't like them, Zimms sells rebuilt arms for $179.
I've seen the control arms from Euro Dyn, they look great.

> I have heard Fabcar is the only way to go for a track car, but the cost

If you're real serious, and plan on doing a lot of races, and your
car is going to be set up to the Nth degree, then yes, most definately
go with Fabcar. If you have the money, your car is a low as it can
go, and you want the comfort factor, go with Fabcar. Hell, if you
can afford it, go with Fabcar. 

However, if you can't, the stock control arms have worked well for
me, and a number of other people. FYI, the suspension on my car is
all original, and it's at stock ride height.

> The labor to replace the control arms looks fairly simple - a hack

It is. For a first timer,  plan on 2 hours per arm. There is a 
procedure written somewhere. I think it was by Mike Kehr, the
guy that wrote the clutch FAQ, but I'm not sure. Either way,
it's not that tough. If you're lucky, you won't even need an
alignment when you're done.
