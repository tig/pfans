John,

If you aren't going to do it all at once you will probably be happier in the
interim doing the anti-roll bars in pairs and the springs and torsion bars in
pairs later. Some savings by only having to worry about one alignment after
doing the torsion bars and springs at the same time (although if you are
careful and don't change ride height you might get it pretty close for the
front).
