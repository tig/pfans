     Hey there,
     
     Actually I had an excellent experience with them. They did a superb 
     job on the clutch, and id'd some problems that I had them fix while 
     they were 'in there.' This wasn't made up stuff, but legitimate 
     mechanical issues that the previous owner had told me of, but that I 
     didn't tell them about. I would have had them do it all, but I've shot 
     my maintenance wad for the year. My mechanic was Art, and he owns and 
     drives a nicely prepared 944 Turbo. 
     
     I did not supply my own parts, but went with their suggestions for 
     pieces. The pressure plate is a stock item, but we used a 930 disk.
     (I'm hoping to get in some Driver's Ed events next season !!!) It's a 
     little grabbier than some might prefer, but I like it just fine.
     
     There was some water in the distributor cap when I picked it up, 
     apparently driven in there when they steam cleaned the motor. Art took 
     care of it promptly, and Omar mounted a new pair of windshield wipers 
     for me for the trouble. 
     
     I guess timing is everything.
     
     Yours,
     Russell Therrien
     '87 944 Turbo, nice clutch, lots more dead bugs

Hey Russell,
     
How did everything work out on your car? My problem with intersport is 
even worse. Now the clutch assembly is loose. I have found a few people 
who shared {SNIP} stories about their experiences at intersport. Let 
know how work  turned out for you.
