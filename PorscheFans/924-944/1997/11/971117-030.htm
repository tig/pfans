I first want to thank everyone that responded to my other postings! The
information was very helpful.

I've had my 944 for about a month now and have just seriously started to
drive it on a regular basis, and I've discovered that it has a problem.
While running at highway speeds the temperature guage consistently reads
at the halfway point (right at 12 oclock). I'll assume that this normal?
When I'm idling at a red light for more that a minute or so the guage
starts to climb up and up. When it gets near the upper end of the scale
the electric fan will kick in. It'll heat up so much that something
under the hood starts to smoke.

I'll done a visual inspection under the hood and everything looks
normal.

The thermostat looks like it was recently replaced--It looks newer then
the rest of the aluminum and there's black silicone sealer that looks
fairly fresh pressed out around the seal. The hoses look like they've
been replaced. There are no signs of coolant leakage. The coolant color
is normal. There's no squealing or leakage that would indicate a bad
water pump bearing. The heater works fine and there's no leakage any
where inside the car to indicate a heater core problem.

Anyone have a similar problem in the past?

Thanks,
Mark
