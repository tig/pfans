I really don't want to start any flaming debates on this list, so PLEASE
consider this as just my $0.02 about several of the comments about the
adjustable fuel pressure posts:

First, I think that everyone in search of incremental performance should
keep in mind that by arbitrarily "bolting on" the latest widget (in this
case, the "widget" is the adjustable regulator) does not automatically
transform our cars into land-based jets. What this device does is
increase fuel flow through injectors which are tuned by Porsche for the
stock fuel pressure. Yes, sometimes these factory settings are
maintained to the lowest common denominator to account for gas types,
drivability, reliability, gov't regulations, etc.. The adjustable  fuel
pressure regulator potentially optimizes what the factory could not, to
meet the conditions of the market.

Second, (now I'll get on my soapbox), any component we add to the engine
compartment should be tuned to the engine as a whole.  For example, if
we add more fuel into the cylinders, what should be done to the air
intake / turbo to maximize and balance the effects? How far can we push
these devices without causing catastrophic failures? Can the injectors
reliably handle the incremental load? What needs to be done to the chip
mapping? And once the exhaust is burnt in the cylinder, what has been
done to optimize the extraction of those burnt gases? Often, there are
questions from those who spend $$$ on the latest widget and feel it
didn't deliver the results as expected. Less often, there are cases
where a component is added and it stresses complimentary systems to the
point of failure. My point here is that when we consider adding these
"widgets", they need to be considered against tuning the engine itself
as "the system". (Off my soapbox.)

As there are over 1300 list member reading these posts, I think that we
should try to keep in mind that this modification in not just a
"bolt-on-turn-your hair-on-fire" widget.  It does need to be viewed a a
small step in overall engine system tuning.

Again, just my $0.02
