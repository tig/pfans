<<David: where is the X-relay? I looked in the owner's manual and each
relay in the fuse-box is marked with a function, but none marked

'84 944>>

Hello Surya
	I just checked my Porsche "techs & parts book", it does not show a X-Relay
listed - as you have found out! On the series II cars (85.5 and up) the relay
is part#928-615-111-01 I'm not sure if your car uses the same relay? May be
you should try contacting your local Porsche dealer. 
	The book does list an other relay I think you should check. In relay
position #21,  part#928-618-107-02  is a relay labeled "dual headlight relay"
- I would think that this relay supplies power for low & high beams. Pry off
the relays cover and chech the contacts for scourching/burt marks. This could
be your problem. If its cheap I would buy a new one.
	One note: it seems that the early 924's have two relays for the low and high
beams: one called "power suply relay" and the other called "high beam relay".
For you older vintage 924'ers out there - there are like three different
relays for these two position over the years '78 - '79. 

										Good Luck
