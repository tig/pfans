Yeah!!  Get to the track, guys.  Then your 944 will ALWAYS feel slow on a
straight.   You're not driving a straight-line Chevy or Grand National. 
Straight-line speed has only two dangers -- a bird (or god forbid an elk)
cracking the windshield, or your date eventually getting bored and falling
asleep, and going out with a track driver next time.  Oh yeah -- three
dangers -- guess a blow-out wouldn't be fun.  OK, four -- you could get
really embarassed because the cop's Crown Vic goes faster in a straight
line.

Anyone have an opinion on when straight-line speed DOES get scary?  +200
mph? Or is it just a question of habituation? Regarding top ends for the
various 944s, my S2 will do 150 at 7000 ft altitude w/ a slight tailwind.
Otherwise it reaches 145-147.  I sometimes do this (on a very straight road
with no traffic where you can see other cars coming for at least 2 miles,
officer) just before a track event, just to get rid of the feeling of
speed. When you slow down to 100, it feels like 55.

i have a poster at home that says the top speed of a 83 944 is 137, this may
be for the Euro model though, also who has had their clutch done lately? my
rubber center is going, you can turn the torque tube about a 1/4 turn, think
it is time to have it done? And how much has people on this list had their
clutches done for? the quote I recieved seems high and I would like to
compare, also has anyone done the rear seal? mine is seeping a little, thanx
