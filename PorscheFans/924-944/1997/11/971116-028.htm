I am not sure about the '86 but my '89 plug broke when I reinstalled it 
(just the head of the screw broke off).  I looked closely at the screw 
(plug) and the phillips slot is actually very deep.  I believe that 
breakage could be attributed to using too big a phillips bit hence you only 
had a bite on the very head of the screw.  I can still install and remove 
mine if I use a smaller phillips head screwdriver.  In fact, it appears 
that the plug itself bottoms in the radiator so a missing screw head is no 
big deal.  I intend to pick up another plug when convenient but I tested it 
thoroughly and between the plug bottoming out, the rubber grommet on the 
screw, and the fan wires secured so they block access to the front of the 
screw I am confident that it will not work its way loose.
