Ok, here it is 6:35pm on Sunday night.  I have finally gotten the
@#$#$%# balance shaft pulleys off and now am fully focused on the
crankshaft pulley.  BUT, when I put a screwdriver in the flywheel teeth,
rest it up against the case and prepare the 'big freeking breaker bar'
type pressure I'm gonna put on that nut like everyone says, a thought
occurs to me.  150lbs of torque, at least, on a nut which transfers that
to the flywheel which transfers that to the screwdriver which transfers
that to the aluminum case?  Now, I'm no metalurgist, but is this gonna
crack that case?  I'll go ahead and work on lapping the valves in the
head in hopes that someone will email me back soon to tell me not to
worry about the case cracking.  Any quick responses will be greatly
appreciated and I'll put you on my christmas card list, and give you my
first born, and let you have my girlfriend, and tell everyone what a
genius you are and everything......


Thanks
