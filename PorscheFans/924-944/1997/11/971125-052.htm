Well, I bought my '87 924S a few months ago and the sunroof gears were completely
shot.  I finally replaced them, and I've noticed that water still leaked in.  Upon
inspection, I found that one of the black geared slider thigies went up a little more
than the other (and the one that was shorter was on the side that leaked).  So, I
decided to take them apart again, and more carefully mount them.  In the process, as
I was lowering the sliders, I heard a loud snap/clunk.  One of the gears is shot
AGAIN.  I'd like some really complete info on how to correctly install the gears, and
have them in sync and everything.  I belive what broke the gear is that the black
slider dude went all the way down, but the motor still turned, and it's obviously
stronger than that plastic.  I know it automatically stops on the way up, is it
supposed to on the way down?  (Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the
two sides were not at the same level, though they're supposed to be.)  TIA!
