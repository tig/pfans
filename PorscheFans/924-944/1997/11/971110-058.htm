I own a '89 944 and recently began experiencing a rough idle on my car
at stop lights.  The weather has been getting colder (it's been snowing
so that's what gave me the clue) and I drive my car usually on short
trips to run errands.  Sometimes it feels as though the car may stall
but never has.  I worry that eventually it will reach that stage.  Does
anyone know what the problem may be?  I have 110,000 miles on the
odometer.

Also, I have recently developed a brake fluid leak but have no clue
where.  I've had to top it off 3 times in the past 3 months and I know
that can't be right.  I look at the driveway and don't notice any stains
on the pavement....does anyone have a clue as to who is stealing my
brake fluid????

Thanx in advance
