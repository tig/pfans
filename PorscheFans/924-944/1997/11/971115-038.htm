Tom:

I have a Valentine One, and recommend it highly.  Generally, if the roads are
crowded, your will receive a warning from the radar's signal being fired at a
car ahead of you.  Instant on from close range will still nail you if there
haven't been any cars previously in the area.  Also, it has a nice
directional feature that shows where the threat is coming from, plus 360
degree scanning.  Mine also has laser detection, but this is fairly useless
because it is line of sight and very short range.  An advantage to winter
driving, though, is that (I'm told) the laser must be fired through an open
window.  This means a car has to be parked stationary on the median, so the
policeman can fire it out the side window.  This eliminates "trolling" into
oncoming traffic.  Every laser trap I've seen is set up this way.

I also have a verrry early Escort (steam powered, I think).  Since you live
near me, let me know if you want me to dig it out--I'd be happy to let you
borrow it for your trip.  I'd loan you the Val One, but I have some long
distance driving planned for that same time frame. 

I don't like radar detectors, and rarely speed, but I hate speed radar
because it distracts police from what I feel their real job should be:
protecting the public by ticketing unsafe (the definition of which is in no
way synonymous with speed) drivers, rather than hiding stationary in the
bushes, using radar as a revenue-generating measure.  I also have utmost
respect for the police in general (several friends and one family member are
officers).  I just can't abide any further erosions of my freedom.

Please drive carefully.  I can't wait to see that beautiful car.

Terry
