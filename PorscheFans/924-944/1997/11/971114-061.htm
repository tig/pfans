Hi P-fans!
 I just got my copy of the Dec 97 Excellence. As usual, it's full of good
stuff, including  a 944 turbo Tech Forum and some 944 h.p./top speed numbers
in the tech. notes section! It's one of those issues with a real water-cooled
influence.
  Now for a couple questions... 
1)  Does anyone have a good rear sway bar for my 1985.5 na 944? Partsheaven
quoted me $75 for a 944 bar and $150 for a turbo bar, which sounds pretty
good to me. I could also use a strut tower bar. E-mail me direct  to save
band-width at mikekosat@AOL.com.
 2)  Which exhaust system ( Borla, ANSA, etc) works best on a stock NA944? I
don't want to spend  $$$ for stainless if longitivity is the only difference,
as this is a learning vehicle more than one I'm liable to keep forever. It is
my daily driver so I want it to run, look, and sound good. Also are headers a
noticable improvement over the stock exhaust manifold?
3)Last question... Is reshaping the exhaust port on a 944 two-valve easy to
do ? I would really appriciate it if someone who has done this could give me
some insights before I start removing metal!

Now for my $.02 worth...Replacing a flex gasket/transmission dampner in a 944
auto is  not a job for the week-hearted or mechanically challanged, but can
be done. Don't use a old/salvaged part , but don't pay Porsche prices! Don
Mcgill sells them for$549 and Vertex sells them for $475 so don't pay
$800-$900. A thousand dollars labor sounds high but it is a labor intensive
job and   I was glad to let someone else do mine!
  Porsches are dependable cars in my view, but inexpensive they are not. I
sell Saturns, (which are a very dependable, inexpensive vehicle), to make a
living, and then I take the money to  buy my Porsche new parts.
