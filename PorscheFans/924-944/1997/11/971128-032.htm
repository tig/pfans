Dear Wesley & P-Fans
	Here is my 0.02 cents worth on your NOx emission test results. First of all,
I think that 227 ppm NOx is not really that high. But here are some items I
think you might check: 


>>The smog test place lists possible causes as:
1)engine deposits, how do you eliminate/reduce these?
*Engine deposits or Carbon build up is caused by fuel quality (the amount of
detergent(s) the gas contains)  I Recommend using a fuel injector cleaner
like Chevron TechRon. Just remember it will take several treatments before
their is any result. 

2)excessively lean air/fuel ratio. Is this adjustable on my 1991 model year?
*I think that the C0% can be adjusted on the S2's, it is adjustable on all
turbo's. Flat camshaft lobe(s) can decreases the EGR effect. Or Failing
hydro-chain tensioner, or a stretched timing chain, or the camshaft timing
could be out of phase, check TDC timing marks on the camshafts.

3)excessive spark advance. Does my 944 adjust timing by turning the
distributor or?
*No there is no timing adjustment. But a loose inductive pickup sensors above
the flywheel - can cause the timing to change on the fly. This would also
sometimes cause the idle speed to change. Check the two 10 mm bolt heads for
tightness. 

4)faulty thermostatic air cleaner system. I didn't think our 944' used this?
*No the 944's/968's did not have this. But is your air filter clean? When was
your last oil change, old oil w/lots of gasoline will cause high HC's, I do
not know about NOx - though?


Carbon deposits:
	Carbon deposits occur when you shut off the engine, and the fuel flow does
not stop right away, there will be a small amount of fuel that is sprayed
onto the intake valve or that drips off the injector due to a leaking check
valve, these fuel drops will build up over time. Eventually you will have
large chunks of carbon on the intake valves and pistons - "carbon build up".
These carbon deposits can starve the engine of fuel when first started in the
morning. The reason is the carbon deposits dry out and act like a sponge when
the fuel get sprayed on them, instead the fuel flowing past the intake
valve,into the cylinder. The fuel gets absorbed by the carbon build up. The
deposit on the pistons can increase the compression ratio and cause
pre-ignition before the spark plug actually fire - causing "engine knock" or
"ping".
	There are a few ways to remove the deposits: You can physically scrape them
off with a pick. You can use chemicals to reduce the build up. Or you can
blast the carbon away with a walnut shells blaster - the walnut shells burn
away once the engine is started up after the procedure. 
			   Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
