Hello, all

I am reading the discussion about spinning with interest.

About 2 years ago, my partner was driving our 1983 944 at about 25mph into a
left-hand bend. Suddenly, the car swerved left. The steering wheel was
pulled from her hands. She hit the brakes, but could not stop in time to
stop hitting a small brick wall. She was not hurt, but sadly the car was an
economic write-off. In fact, the damage was not too great and the car was
well repaired and is now back on the road.

The road was dry, but a bit bumpy. The light was poor, but it was not dark.
No alcohol nor excessive tiredness nor excessive speed was involved. She
cannot remember making an error to cause the accident.

There were no witnesses and no-one else in the car. To this day, she does
not know what caused the accident. No mechanical fault could be seen. The
front left strut and front anti-roll bar was very bent, but nothing was
broken.

The angle of impact caused all some puzzlement. It only made sense if the
_rear_ end had slid out. At the time, I just could not accept this - I
believed that the 944's tail was always stuck like glue, unless the driver
had done something quite extreme. Now, I am beginning to wonder.

Have we identified a dangerous trend? People seem to be having random
accidents in these cars involving sudden, unpredictable loss of rear-end
grip. If this is a real problem, it is potentially very serious.

Are there any trends that can be spotted? Our car was, to the best of my
knowledge, in good condition. I had known it from new, and know for certain
that it had not suffered any accidents. It had covered about 135,000 miles.
The front suspension had been rebuilt at about 100k. The rear dampers were
about 30k miles old, but the rear otherwise was original. I had a good set
of Goodyear Eagle NCTs all round. The car did not have power steering (this
was not available in right-hand drive cars in '83). The gearbox was
original, slick to use, and not noisy.

Someone mentioned a displaced anti-roll bar bush after their accident. Could
failure of this bush have caused the accident? Frankly, I don't know how
these were in our car.

Another problem that occurs to me is handbrake failure. An acquaintance of
mine left the road at 60mph when his handbrake jammed on. A transient
handbrake fault could cause a spin.

A gearbox failure also is a possibility, if it could cause a rear wheel to
lock-up fleetingly. I once had a box in an MG engage two of its dog clutches
at once. The effect is that the box internals stop turning. In the MG, this
caused the rear wheels to lock up briefly, before the layshaft broke.

Maybe all of these accidents were driver error, but I believe that it is in
all of our interests to consider the alternative possibility. It is always
at the backs of the minds of my partner and me - it is still an issue since
we now have a 1985 car.

All the best,
Alistair.
