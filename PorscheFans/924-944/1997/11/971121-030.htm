      I own a '90 944 in the best possible condition. I am wanting to 
upgrade to a turbo set up. I know I can just bye a 951, BUT where I 
live, Berlin Germany, all Turbos are either very expensive ($15000) 
and/or in very bad shape, even the interior of the Turbos are much worse 
the the 944NA. The same goes for the S2, so if anyone is planning on 
giving me advice in buying a Turbo as if it were the discovery of the 
theory of relativity, DON'T. I will appreciate any and all information. 
What I would need to know is how much the trans, differential, CV joints 
can take. And then the engine, what would have to be reinforced? If I am 
not mistaken the trans of the 944 can take up to 380Hp, but I am 
confused on if it was the 924 with the Porsche trans or the 944 with the 
Audi trans. Again thank you all, even those who abstained from their 
prophecies.
