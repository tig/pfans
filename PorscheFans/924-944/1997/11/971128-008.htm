Hi Pfans,

I just stopped at a Racetek cage dealer and looked at an installed
cage in a wrecked 951 with no interior. I like the idea of a sill 
mounting. It looks strong and makes a lot of sense. I mentioned to
the dealer that looking at the design, it seems that the rear fold down 
seat top has to come off (the cage has two rear braces that extend 
into the hatch area). I don't have a problem with that, but he also
mentioned that if I was going PCA club racing, the seat would have
to remain, in a halfway state, neither fully up or fully down. He stated
that interior items can be removed for safety reasons, but the PCA 
rules folks have decreeded that the top half of the seat has to remain.

You racers with Racetek cages, or others that know, is this an accurate 
statement?
