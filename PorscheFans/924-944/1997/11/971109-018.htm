If you read my words carefully, you'll notice the words "Stage II" in
parentheses.  Both the horsepower and torque advantages are mine indeed.

And in my original passage, all I said was that the 911 drivers would
eventually catch up to me at the next stoplight.  That doesn't imply that I
take them off the line.  On the contrary, a 968 or 911 with a decent driver
will almost always jump me off the line.  But like you said, after 3K, the
rest is history.  And let's not even get into a situation where there may be
a few twisties between those stoplights...

Besides stoplights, I haven't seen too many NA 911s that can keep up with me
on hills either.

Ben (not scared of any NA 911 on the street unless I see a Borla, racing
harness, or roll cage)
