Pfans,

        Having bought a solid 1990 S2 and minting it out in every way,
including the infamous chain tensioner, I have just come across a deal that
may be too good to pass up. Today at a small used car lot in Florida I
located a 1988 Turbo S for sale on consignment. It is being represented as a
plain turbo but it has the original sticker which says that it is the Turbo
S package making 247HP. It has the forged cup wheels, bigger tires -new Comp
TA 225 front, 245 rear, the m30 suspension and an upgraded stereo. I
couldn't get under the car to see if it has the oil cooler on the tranny. It
has no other visible indications that it is an S and as I have never seen an
S, I am not 100% sure of myself here. The new car sticker (cardex?) which
has the information about the S package has the same VIN as the car. The car
appears to have some paint but I could not see any indication of body work.
The paint was also excellent but under the hood you could see a difference
between the newer paint and the old. The car also seemed not to pull quite
as well as I would have expected. It is a one owner car and has 43500 on the
odo. The asking price is $9600. The salesman said he thought the car would
sell for $8700. It is in an area with lots of older people who wouldn't be
interested in this type of car. The current owner is a cardiologist who
apparently has lots of money and just wants the car to go down the road. My
mechanic who would check it out if I get serious said the lack of power may
be a wastegate problem.
Any advice or suggestions here? TIA
