Steve asked (-Steve-jtselect@mach7.com),

According to one of my books:
By the time the 924 testing programme was under way, it had already been
decided that a VW engine would power the car - one that itself was in it's
early development stages at the Audo Research centre at Ingolstadt.
Code-named EA831, it was an extensively developed version of the
four-cylinder engine that had been introduced in 1965.  This unit would also
end up in the VW LT van and the Audi 100.

Dear Mitch & P-Fans
	I'm not sure what the EA831 Project is/was. ?  My books explain that VW paid
Porsche to develop a series of economy cars that could also spawn off a
sports car project - this was in the early '70's. Porsche had two years left
in the contract, to finish the project, they were looking for a replacement
for the aging 911, but VW canceled the project before bringing the cars to
production. Porsche had hoped that VW would economy cars would be the
foundation for a all out sports car - a Porsche. This was the EA-266 project.
VW was paying the way for Porsche to build a 911 successor.  VW was paying
Weissach an enormous amount of money, first a few years earlier VW aborted
the 914 project, paying dearly. Now they canceled the EA-266 project. The EA-4
25 project became the 924 Porsche model. Which in turn became the 944/951
models. 



Code-named Projects: 
		  EA-831  =  ?
           EA-266 = a car for VW w/a range of sports cars 					  for Porsche
canceled. Before the 924       	 			  project begun.
		  EA-425 = 924




As far as I can tell, these are all the 924 GT-S-P-R Models: 

The Models

1979 924 Turbo -  The "euro" production turbo version produced 170 Hp, up

mph, 				SOHC design 2V per cyl., turbo in front of cylinder #1 by oil
filter.
			59 were built, for '80 &'81 MY, for homologation into Group 4.
			Of those 59 "GTS" cars built, 15 were "Club Sport" models. 

1981 Carrera GT-R, Rally version 280 Hp. 
1981 Carrera GT-R, Le Mans Race version 375 Hp @6400 rpm, 4V 928 Block/Hd.
				prototype of the the 944, 1/2 of the 928 engine, turbo is					located on
the intake manifold side, ala 951 style. 2.5 Liter
	                                  : also have seen  420 Hp @ 6800 rpm,
quoted - 4V 928 B/H
			          : also have seen  410 Hp @6500 rpm, quoted - 4V 928 B/H

			            Three cars were built, one prototype, & two cars to race at
					Le Mans.
				Chassis number 924-006 was a new car that was built. 				
           Chassis number 924-004 & 001 (prototype mule) were '80

					                                               	1/2 of the 928 engine
GTR = '81 MY 
GTP = '80 MY 



*Note: in 1980 two of the three GTP's developed a burnt valve do to the
location of the turbo, right by the #1 cylinder, same spot as say the oil
filter in a 944. For 1981 the GTR's had a 2.5 liter engine with 4V design,
1/2 of the 928 engine! The turbo was move to the intake manifold side (ala
951)  to reduce underhood engine temps. The GTR's was the father of the 944 &
Turbo models.
