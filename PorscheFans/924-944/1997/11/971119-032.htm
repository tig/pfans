HELP!  I need help with my '77 924 which just cut out on me for the first
time: While driving, after about an hour of travel, the car started cutting
out intermittently, then died while at speed (55 mph). It's acting like the
fuel delivery is functioning only intermittently. The pump relay is good
(verified it's operation). After letting the car sit for 15 min, it started and
ran briefly (~1 min) before dying. After another 15 min, it started again
and ran for a good 3-5 min without error before I turned it off to take the
cab I had called. When it started, it started right away, but when I tried it
between those 15 min intervals, it would not start at all.

Does anyone have any ideas what this might be, and tests to run? Could
it be that the fuel pump is now overheating? (The fuse on the pump relay
did not blow) Could there be another component that has failed? There
were no other signs of failure.

Please help me, this is my only car, and I'm stranded right now.
