Hi,

New member here.  Just bought a 1985 1/2 Porsche 944 with 76K miles.  
Nice car.  Everything seems normal and well maintained except for a great 
deal of "slop" in the driveline.  If I jack it up and leave it in gear 
while securing one wheel, the other will rotate over 1/4 turn freely 
before hitting a solid stop in either direction.  Doesn't seem to be any 
freeplay in the pinion gears, no funny noises while running, no 
vibration, 5-speed shifts fine, clutch seems to have normal pedal and 
doesn't grab or shudder or anything -- just has a lot of driveline slop. 
I have heared both that it may have a positraction differential and that 
there is something wrong internally and that the clutch driven disc came 
with a rubber hub that may have gone away allowing the clutch to rotate 
to the safety stops.  I'm thinking probably the clutch but would like to 
have some other thoughts before I rip into it.  Any ideas or 
confirmations?   Thanks for your help.  Greg Laws, Winfield, KS
