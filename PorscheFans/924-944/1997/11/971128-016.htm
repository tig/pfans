PFans --

The brake rotors on my S2 do not appear to have made it successfully thru
the track season. I've got way too much shudder under heavy braking.  I'm
going to have all the rotors checked and turned to make sure they're the
problem. Meanwhile, thought it might be time to consider some decent
slotted rotors, which I understand will last longer than cross-drilled
rotors. Can someone recommend a source w/ decent prices? Best I've seen
$100-110 each, but I don't know about the quality.

TIA.

Hello P-Fans
	I have been getting a few questions regarding my results from using a
Air/Fuel Meter. I have a 1986 944 Turbo, stock, with 160K miles, only mods
are: AutoThority Stage II chips V2.7, a test pipe, K&N cartrige air filter,
and a new O2 sensor.  I used a air/fuel meter from RB Racing - they make a lot
of custom turbo kits for motorcycles. Some of their customers even go out to
the salt lakes to attemp land speed records. RB Racing sells a air/fuel meter
to calibrate their custom programmable fuel injection systems. The thing I
like is the meter comes with a detailed 7 page "tuning manual" on how to read
the meter. The manual is written for turbo charge engines perspective - but is
use full for NA's also. If any one would like a copy let me know. 
	The RSR air/fuel ratio meter displays digitally via ten L.E.D.'s your exact
air/fuel ratio. There are ten L.E.D.'s divided into four color divisions:
(Left to Right: Lean (17.1:1) to Rich ( 12.1:1)), three green, four yellow,
two orange and two red L.E.D.s. You can tell at a glance what the air/fuel
ratio is by looking at the color of the L.E.D..  The chemically "correct"
point at which the most complete combustion takes place which is 14.7 parts of
air to one part fuel by weight.  This is also refereed to as "stoic" or 14.7:1
air/fuel ratio. 
	My results with the RSR meter. On hard acceleration the meter goes up to the
first L.E.D., ie 12.7:1 air/fuel ratio. On part throttle or steady state
throttle the meter reads last yellow (14.4:1) & first orange (13.8:1) or
around 13.2:1 air fuel ratio just what it should be. 
	Now for my car, I do not see how more fuel could be use full. In fact when I
installed a higher fuel pressure reg. last year - The meter indicated one
L.E.D. Higher readings all the time. On full throttle accel the meter went all
the way to the last red L.E.D. or over 12.1:1 air/fuel ratio. As you recall I
observed a slight increase of power seat of the pants wise (who knows may be I
felt the engine not revving up quite as fast?) but at part throttle the higher
fuel reg. killed power!
