Hello P-Fans
	Does your "whirling sound" go away when you push in the clutch? If so it
could be a bearing inside the trans. If the "whirling sound" increases with
vehicle speed, the noise is probably a bad bearing inside of the trans - on
the differential side though. The diff could have a chipped tooth. Diff
bearings start making noises under light load - deceleration or acceleration
at first. With in a few hundred miles it will become worse - if indeed the
diff bearings are bad, followed by a tearing shed by the owner once he finds
out the bill for the repairs! 		
	 The noise could be your CV Joints - but you did not mention any vibrations
being felt. Usually when the CV's are worn - you can feel a vibration on hard
accel. Sometimes the CV's will also "click" or "clunk" - during hard Corning
and acceleration - a sure sign of worn or dry CV's. 
	If it was my car I would repack the CV's or replace as necessary and change
the trans fluid with SWEPCO. Be sure to look at the drained trans fluid for
metal particles and chunks. The trans hold 2.0 liters w/o trans oil cooler,
2.7 liters w/oil cooler.
	Do not forget to eliminate the wheel bearing for a source of this noise.
Jack up the car and test all the bearings. Maybe even run the rear wheels in
the air (put the rear on jack stands) to check for any noises. Put the car in
2nd or 3rd, try holding one wheel at a time (stopping the rotation) and
listen for the noise. You can use this technique to pinpoint which wheel
bearing (or diff bearing) is bad. 
					
						Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
