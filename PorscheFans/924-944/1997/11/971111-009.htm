Well, suprisingly, your problems may be related...

1) you have a vacuum leak that is causing false air to the intake system...

2) your brake fluid is disappearing into the brake booster (a vacuum device)
.... You need a
new brake master cylinder, or at least one that is not leaking....

Good Luck!

Subject: rough idle


|I own a '89 944 and recently began experiencing a rough idle on my car
|at stop lights.  The weather has been getting colder (it's been snowing
|so that's what gave me the clue) and I drive my car usually on short
|trips to run errands.  Sometimes it feels as though the car may stall
|but never has.  I worry that eventually it will reach that stage.  Does
|anyone know what the problem may be?  I have 110,000 miles on the
|odometer.
|
|Also, I have recently developed a brake fluid leak but have no clue
|where.  I've had to top it off 3 times in the past 3 months and I know
|that can't be right.  I look at the driveway and don't notice any stains
|on the pavement....does anyone have a clue as to who is stealing my
|brake fluid????
|
|Thanx in advance
