something similar happened to me twice within the first three months of
ownership... I have heard it described as "transaxle toss"

the first time, I was on new tires, but they had at least 300 miles on
them... I was on an onramp to the freeway and the turn onto the ramp was a
little off camber and I was in the power curve of second gear (assuming of
course the validity of a 944NA having a power curve at all)... demise was
instant... I spun counter clockwise, countersteered and then spun
clockwise, countersteered again, and spun counterclockwise... amazing, I
hit nothing, and thoroughly covered all the onramp, I was all over the
place... well, the wierd thing is, I was only going 35-40mph...

the second time was a little stupid (maybe a lot stupid) on my part, I was
late for a meeting, and our favorite freeway was STOPPED COLD at 2pm...
pissed, I got off the next exit, gunned to the first exit popped over a
hill, and CRAP, everybody else had the same idea, so I'm like too close to
this stopped Honda Accord and still on it, braking is not an option, I will
eat trunk, so I fling the car into the only gap available to me, and well,
you know the theme of this e-mail, I spin clockwise in a roar of tires and
bright red paint (to match the color of my face) but come to a stop much
quicker than the onramp experience

the only difference, I can think of was, I depressed the clutch in the
second instance, and not depressing the clutch in the first instance made
me spin more and more... in the first instance, I refused to believe I was
losing it (I mean, that violent at 35mph?) until I was stalled backwards on
the onramp smiling weakly to the new flow of traffic...

both of these were pretty low speed, and the car does understeer in
general, so the transition between under and oversteer seems pretty
abrupt...

I have since also heard somebody else mention the importance of depressing
the clutch in these situations, assuming that you are not in a controlled
slide where the usual countersteer and throttle modulation will get you
through...

to help me out, when it rains, sometimes I will go to a wet empty parking
lot (no lightpoles or concrete things) and go 30-40mph and try to pull off
a 90 degree turn, the wetness helps produce the desired undesired effect
(as well as saving the tires somewhat), and I get to play with the tail out
at low speed... I know it sound like advice for a Camaro owner, but it
works, I generally feel more in control on the street...
