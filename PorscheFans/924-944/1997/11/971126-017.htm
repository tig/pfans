All,
Unfortunately, you have to trust people sometime.  My experience with
pre-buys has been good.  The first pre-buy I had performed was on a 951 by
Tom Williams Porsche in Birmingham Alabama.  The interior was kind of ragged
out, but the exterior looked pretty good (except it was red, but I was
willing to make a sacrifice on the color for mechanical condition).  Anyway,
the guy from Tom Williams (don't remember his name) relayed the findings to
me over the phone (slightly leaking seals, and some other minor stuff).  I
asked for his opinion on purchasing the car, and he told me "honestly, there
are better 951's out there".  Good man.

Second pre-buy was on a '91 VR4 (3000 GT twinturbo).  (actually, I can't
remember if this was first or if the red 951 was).  Anyway, on the advice of
my secretary's husband (local redneck mechanic) I took it to Danny Peek at
Southern Star Motor Company in Anniston, Alabama (where I live and work).
 Excellent job on the pre-buy inspection, and he filled me in on other
aspects of the riceburner twin turbos.  In discussion with Danny, he asked my
to keep my eye out for a Racing British Green '91 Miata while I was searching
for cars.  I found one, he bought it, and after knowing him over the last
2-1/2 years, I consider him one of my best friends.  The owner of the VR4 and
I were $500 away from making a deal, and I never bought it (THANK GOD!)

The final pre-buy was on an '86 951 in Atlanta Georgia which I ended up
purchasing.  I can't remember who did it.  If anyone wants to know, I can
find out in about a week when I get back home.  Anyway, the prebuy was right
on the money.  I had the few things fixed, and had no other problems for over
a year.

Anyway, I just didn't want anyone considering purchasing thier first Porsche
to think a pre-buy is a waste of money.
