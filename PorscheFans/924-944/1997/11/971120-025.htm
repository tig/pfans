Hello P-Fans
	I'm not sure if the is true - but a Porsche knowlegable friend of mine told
me this story, maybe some of our German members could correct me if I am
wrong.  The Story Goes....
	My friend of mine told me this story:  'That when the 951 came out in 1984
as a '85 MY 944 Turbo - it was a "worldwide engine" meaning that it was the
first Porsche Model to make the same Hp in "Euro trim" and "USA trim".
Shortly after the Turbo's release, German customers were experiencing a loss
of horse power after purchase and several miles driven. Porsche dealers were
finding that the Catalytic Convertors were melting down internally and
becoming clogged. The Dealers could not fugue out why? Porsche did however -
it seems that the cars were rated at 152 mph top speed, but on long stretches
of the German AutoBahn the cars went much faster. So fast - in fact that some
cars hit their rev limiters at 6500 rpm's (?). How fast is that? 163 mph.
When the engine's ECU see's that the engine is exceeding Max rpm's - the ECU
will shut off the ignition - but not the fuel. The fuel is kept on for two
reasons; to cool the valves/engine and too slow the engine from revving even
higher.  These cars were frequently reaching and exceeding the Max rev rpm's
- the presence of raw fuel being dumped into the cat at those speeds caused
the cat's to melt down." My friend did not elaborate if Porsche ever came out
with a fix, or if they just bit the bullet and paid for new cat's until the
cars went out of warranty. Has anyone out there - heard of this story? 
	
My 951 Experiences
	I have a '86 951 with a test pipe installed - and I would reccomend the test
pipe as a honest performance increase! The test pipe I bought was from
Performance Parts, made by BURSCH. I have to admit that this pipe did look
kind of cheesy! It probably will only last a few years, but only cost $200
compared to the $800 mega buck stainless steel. The main benefit of the test
pipe I found - was reaching full boost at 2800 - 3200 rpm depending on the
gear you are in. The engine spools up faster, sounds GREAT! But yet is quiet
at part throttle, and is not too loud at WOT!  
	The legalities.  Running around with the emissions equipment tampered with
is illegal, and carries a $10,000 fine to the owner, $50,000 fine to the shop
doing the modification(s)! But when was the last time you saw EPA-Police
around pulling an offensive car.  By the way here are the results from (w/o a
cat installed)  my car's tail-pipe emissions test:  CO% - 0.43, HC ppm - 64,
@830 rpm's. The CO% limit in Va is 1.20%. 
	I've talked to Al Collins @AutoThority about 951 performance upgrades - here
is what he said.  "When you install a "test pipe" to bypass the catalytic
convertor - the test pipe will lower the back pressure by 2 psi. The 951 has
something like 22 psi of back pressure (if memory serves me correct) and
anything lower than 20 psi (such as when a test pipe is installed) will cause
engine damage. The reason is that the Factory ECU mapping takes advantage of
a "EGR" effect do to valve timing overlap. As the combustion cycle occurs - a
small amount of exhaust gas gets pumped back into the cylinder with incomming
fuel/air charge - this allows the Factory & Chip makers to add ignition
timing to increase throttle response and horse power. When you have an
exhaust that lower the back pressure too much - bellow that 20 psi level, you
no longer have that  "EGR-effect" needed to sustain the ignition timing.
Result is detonation and/or blown head gasket. This is also why 17 psi is the
limit for Max boost level with a "stock" or "chipped" ECU".

PS: any tire with a "N0" stamped into the sidewall is a OEM Approved Porsche
Tire. Look at a Tire Rack ad you'll see the "N0" listed next to the OEM
listed tires.

Subject: converter temps and stock racing

From Panorama, March 1985:

Porsche traces the history of the 944 Turbo back to 1981 at LeMans
where, disguised as a 924GTP, an experimental racing version of the car
finished a credible seventh overall and won a prize for reliability
based on having spent the least time in the pits.  Last June, a
pre-production version 944 Turbo fitted with a standard catalytic
converter won the 24 Hours of Nelson Ledges with a 40 lap advantage. 
The car was so quiet that the drivers kept themselves alert through the
long hours by listening to the radio.
The catalytic converter concept was part of Porsche's basic plan from
the beginning. (and the article continues)


This leads me to think that whoever says that you should punch out the
cat either has a faulty cat or a faulty set-up going somewhere along
the  line.  Is it possible that chipping the car is causing an over-rich
condition and too much unburned fuel is reaching the converter? 
Later!
