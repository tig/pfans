Hello, Folks.

Maybe someone out there could help me out with a query regarding a 1985 944
in United Kingdom specification.

In '85, these cars were set up to use 98 RON fuel. They don't need lead, but
at the time only leaded was available in this RON specification. Now, they
can use super unleaded in the UK, but this is very expensive.

Around the mid '80s "Eurograde" unleaded at 95 RON was becoming commonplace.
Porsche offered a conversion whereby the Motronic box was altered to use the
new fuel, albeit with some loss of power and economy.

My question is: how can I tell if my car has been converted?  I accidentally
filled my car with 95 RON fuel the other day (I brimmed my empty tank so it
was running on pure stuff). I expected horrendous pinking and rough
running - but nothing. It ran just fine. Compared with my last 944 (an '83)
this car gives a couple fewer miles per gallon, and does not feel quite so
fast. So, I have my suspicions.

My Motronic unit has a main label numbered 0261 200 006 and a second
stick-on one marked 944.618.14.03.

Can anyone shed any light on this?

Alistair.
