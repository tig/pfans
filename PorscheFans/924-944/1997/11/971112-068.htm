The Carrera GTP got 410HP out of its turbocharged 2.5l to-be 944 engine. I
think the Carrera GTR had 375HP. The Carrera GT had 210HP, the GTS 245HP,
and the GTS clubsport had 275HP.

             Story of the 924 Carrera GTS 410 PS

Disclaimer: When I saw this post - requesting more information on the 924
Carrera GTS 410 P.S. Model, - I thought no problem I'll just look at one of
my Porsche books in my collection and post the information. The more I
researched this model - the more intrigued I became. Their is very little
printed information - at east that I have found. The following is what I have
come across  and complied as a summary on this special model. I believe the
info is correct - but as they say: "don't believe everything in print",
so....  If any one would like some photos and the text from the articles I
would be glad to Xerox them and send them to you.  davidjalai@aol.com

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SKIP OVER - AS MY POST IS QUITE LONG!

A Little Porsche Company History

	Porsche in the past had always been Volkswagen Research & Development
Company. They did the KDF-Wagen aka the "Beetle". Throughout the years
Porsche was the company that VW came to - to do their R&D. All the way up
through to the 914 project, this is how VW operated - by subcontracting its
R&D. Two years before the 914 contract ended VW put Porsche on notice,
VolkswagenWerk would be doing their own R&D in the future.  


The Porsche that VW financed the R&D

	On October 1st, 1971 - VolkswagenWerk gave notice to Porsche to cease its
outside R&D. Their was two years left in Weissach R&D Center that VW had paid
for. Time was running out and Porsche had no other R&D contracts on the
board. Tony Lapine was given the task to come up with a "sports car" -
something "reasonable" but in only two years time!  There was one caveat: use
anything on the  VW/Audi/Porsche corporate shelves.  With that  - it was the
beginning of the 924 Project. The 924 would be built by Audi at the
Neckarsulam plant (the former NSU plant) in Baden-Wurttemberg.  The Audi
plant was about to close and needed a car to produce. Porsche had Audi build
the car for them since Audi had capacity for production. Audi at the
Neckarsulam Plant produced 924 & 944's there until 1988 US model year. 
	The 924 series began assembly in November 1975 by Audi at the Neckarsulam
Plant. The German Model 924's base price of 23,000 DM (about $8,900), the US
version sold for $9,395. In order to bring the 924's performance up to match
its looks, the 924 was turbocharged for the 1979 model year. The production
turbo version produced 170 Hp, up from 125 Hp. At the "1979 Frankfurt Auto
Show" Porsche introduced their "best kept secret" the 924 Carrera GT. 

The 924 Carrera GT

	The 924 Carrera GT was a stripped out racing model. No interior carpet, just
simple racing buckets and a flat black painted interior, and light weight
plexiglass windows. The drivers and passenger side windows were plexiglass
and flush mounted, the driver could only open a small four inch vertical rear
section. The Carrera weighed 330 lbs less than the stock production 924
Turbo.  The Audi based 2.0 four cylinder, turbocharger and inter cooled,
produced 210 Hp @6000 Rpm's and sold for 50K DM. It had wide & low profile
225/50-16's tires tucked under those flared fenders (now the famous 944
Coke-Bottle sex appeal look) and bulged out. Four hundred cars had to be
built in order to meet FIA's Group 4 rules. Within months they were all built
and sold out. Fully half remained in Germany. 
	A Club Sport - could also be optioned if the customer so desired.
Approximately 15 Carrera GTS model cars were turned into a Club Sport option.
The Carrera GTS-Club Sport:  started out life in GTS trim, with 245 Hp 2.0
liter four mated to the 937/50 five speed manual (from the GT-R) gearbox. The
club sport work was done by the Racing Department. The CS had: 935 style
racing buckets, fiberglass hood & fenders, plastic bumper shells, and sliding
perspex plexiglass window like the full blown race cars. Most of these CS had
all the racing goodies: roll cage, kill switches, four-point harness, fire
extinguisher. The CS also had one more important option - more power! A boost
in performance from 210 Hp to 270 Hp of the inter cooled four. All CS were
painted "Guards Red" from the factory. Priced at DM 110,000, 0-60 in 5 sec's
and top speed of 160 mph. 

The Racing Carrera Models

	Under orders from Ernst Fhmann, Norbert Singer was asked to prepare the 924
Carrera for 1980 Le Mans, running under the newly defined GT-Protoype
category (GTP). This car was called the 924 Carrera GTP.  An aluminum roll
cage was designed to strengthen the chassis. The result was a racecar even
stiffer than a 935!  The turbocharger was relocated slightly to the left and
lower to allow for a cleaner exhaust flow. The brake rotors came from the
917/10 Can-Am race cars and the calipers came from the 936 race cars. Norbet
Singer had a nack for interpreting the rule book to his advantage!  In all
there were four cars built for the 1980 Le Mans. In keeping with the
experimental department's tradition of special chassis numbers, these - four
were built: 924-001 through 924-004,  924 Carrera GTP models. The first car,
#001, was strictly a test mule built for the Le Mans effort. Where the US
specification production 924 Turbo, weighed in at 2,816 Lbs. The Carrera GT
(Street Model, 400 made) weighed in at 2,596 Lbs. The Le Mans version GTS
(about 50 were built) were stripped to 2,046 Lbs!  With 310 Hp available, the
cars topped out at 288 Kph (180 Mph) along the Mulsanne straight. 
	Nothing miraculous was expected from the cars that could only lap Le Mans in
the 4:08's. However, when the race began in the rain, hopes were raised. The
924 GTS handled very neutrally. A problem reappeared in the race that Porsche
experienced with 924-001 prototype at the Paul Ricard Circuit during testing,
valve overheating. Valve overheating crippled the first car: American driven
924-003 car. Then the British driven 924-002 car. The first cylinder on each
engine lost nearly all compression. With the engines running on three
cylinders, both returned to the race, but near the end of the 24 hours, they
lapped the circuit at 4:30 - 4:45 min/lap. The unaffected German car, 924-004
was order by Singer to slow to 4:15 sec/lap. 
	At 4 Pm, surpassing all expectations, all three cars finished. Barth
finished in 6th, and Bell in 13th position. The German driven car,
 Dron/Rouse three cylinder car finished 12th overall and 5th in class. Not
bad for a bunch of prototypes first time out of the box! 
	For 1981, Porsche tried again with two 924's. One, 924-004, had run the year
before.  The second car, 924-006, was new. The '81 cars looked nearly
identical outside. It took a careful examination to detect the differences.
In 1981 a series of fifty Carrera GTS models were produced to update the FIA
Group 4 homologation. In standard form the 924 Carrera GTS was legal for
street use in Germany and produced 245 Hp @6250 Rpm's. The real purpose, was
for the 924 Carrera GTS was a basis for building up the 924 Carrera GT-R for
racing and rallying. Power for the rally version was increased to 280 Hp and
power for the racing model was increased to 375 Hp @6400 Rpm's. 
	During the winter months, Singer constructed another new prototype (the GT-R
 model), 924-005, which under went extensive testing at Paul Ricard circuit.
The prototype and the Le Mans cars had modified bodywork to cope with the
demands of the new engine. More air was needed to cool the engine and fatter
tires ran in the back so the rear quarters were widened. The nose had four
big slots along the leading edge, the '80 Carrera GT model had no such vents
, just a solid flat nose. 
	Only under the hood was the differentness apparent of the previous '80 GTP
model to the New '81 GT-R model:  the GT-R was the prototype of Porsche's
successor - 944. The engine was half of a 928 block, four valve head and all
plus a turbo! The engine had a bore & stroke of 100 mm X 78.9 mm, displacing
2.5 liters. The engine was placed at a 45 degree angle and the engine used
 Porsche's new belt driver overhead camshafts with  four valves per cylinder.
The crankshaft was also new, a counter balanced piece capable of high Rpm's
with no vibrations. The engine also used a new advanced electronic
computerized fuel injection and electronic ignition systems, allowing
extraordinary sensitivity to air and throttle inputs.  Boost was set to 1.1
Bar for the race. 
	The GTP/GT-R Le Mans cars weighted in at 2,196 Lbs and produced 420 Bhp
@6,800 Rpm's!  Singer install a fifth gear making it impossible to exceed
6200 Rpm's in order to prevent burnt valve damage that occurred at the
previous Le Mans race. 
	For the 1981 Le Mans, Jurgen Barth and world rally champion Walter Rohrl
finished 7th overall in the GT-R. They spent very little time in the pits -
only to refuel. Not a bad finish for the future  944 model.  While the 924
GTR's did not win they did finish the race which says quite a bit for their
reliability. Porsche also brought three 936's out to do battle at '81 Le
Mans. The three 936/81's were taken out of the museum, fitted with a twin
turbo - Indy engine, converted to run on gas, dusted it off, and won the
race!  The 936/81's finished 1 -2 -3 at the '81 Le Mans.
