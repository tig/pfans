Larry,

It sounds like the crankshaft bolt has worked itself free.  Without the
bolt the water pump pulley will fall off, and then the
AC/Alternator/balance shaft pulley, and then finally the timing belt
pulley.  If only the PS pulley has fallen off, then your in luck.

If your lucky that big bolt should be around the area.  It sounds like
no real damage has been done.  Find the crankshaft bolt and put the
pulley back on.  Tighten the bolt till you can't tighten it any more,
then tighten some more (~150 lbs of torque).

Count yourself lucky.  Many people spend much time and money to try and
get the crankshaft bolt off.  Yours happened to come off by its own free
will.  Now you can do those things that requires the bolt to be removed
(change waterpump, change belts, change crankshaft seal, etc...) Woo
hoo.
