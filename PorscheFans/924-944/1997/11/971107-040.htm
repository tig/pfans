 Hi P-fans!
   I was wondering about a recent comment about milling 944 heads. It was
stated that European spec.  Porsches have higher compression than those
destined for the U.S. market. Is this correct? What is the difference in
compression? What else would be different beyond those things like lights,
bumpers, and emissions? My 1985.5 na 944 is U.S certified, but is a "gray
market" vehicle imported by the previous owner new, with the Euro V.I.N. that
confuses computers at insurance, state inspections, and all manner of other
beurocratcies!
 Also when I wrote that I thought the published top speed for a 8v na 944 was
130, and that mine had indicated a top sustained 151mph, I probably should
have mentioned that I was slowly ( and safely!) pulling away from  a SHO,
which is a car I have driven (on a track) at  a  Ford Ride n' Drive at just
over 140mph true. They are supposed to be governed at 143mph. This is the old
six cylinder, not the v-8 I'm refering to.
 My last band-width wasting comment for today... I finished putting my  new
front end under my car and drove it  today. It sure felt good to park my
Saturn! The alignment is a little off but tomorrow (Saturday) I'm going to
figure out our new Hunter computerized infa-red alignment machine and see if
it does better than my tape measure!
  Yours in Porsche,
