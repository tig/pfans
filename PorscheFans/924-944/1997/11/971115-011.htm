Dear Tom, 

Your reaction is the same as several other people's.  I'm not sure I can
explain why the price was what it was, but have a few thoughts:

-the dealer handles Bentley, Lamborghini and Lotus  in addition to
Porsche. The 951S I bought was the least "prestigious" car in the
building;

-the dealer is located in Manhattan.  Although the showroom and service
area are nice, they are small.  There isn't a lot of space to store
inventory.  Since it is late autumn here when the market for fun cars
slows to a crawl, the dealer may not have wanted to run the risk of
tying up floor space over the winter;

-when I negotiated with the owner (in my experience, it helps to deal
with the boss if you can), it was clear he was distracted by a
construction project he was more or less supervising (they are adding a
customer lounge and accessories/clothing boutique);

-I suspect the dealer was not fully cognizant of how sought after the
951S is.  The car seemed priced at book value:  Price guides are often
off the mark or outdated when assigning values to special interest cars;

-I committed quickly to buy the car for cash.

The above is just theory so take it for what it's worth.  Can't predict
if my experience will help you in your negotiations, but best of luck.
