I've seen several recomendations for Automobile Atlanta but I have to relay
my experience which I'm not real pleased about. Mind you, its not a
disaster but I will probably not use them anymore. 1. I ordered shocks that
came to $139 which was as good a price as I had seen. I ordered by phone
not having a catalog. When the shocks came the shipping was $26! Now, I
don't mind paying a fair price for service but the other places are
charging $10-12 and shipping from CA. I'm in Mississippi. 2. In the packing
box I found a copy of another person's invoice showing his _credit card
no._ I don't think this is acceptable. I don't want _my_ credit card #'s
floating around out there. 3. They don't have a toll free number.

These are my reasons for not using Automobile Atlanta in the future.

the list know the outcome.
