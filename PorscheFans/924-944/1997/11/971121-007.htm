I don't understand this at all. I'm not an expert, so could someone please
explain how the 'EGR' effect allows you to run more advance? My understanding
was that EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) was strictly for emmissions -run
the exhaust gas through the engine one more time to burn up some pollutants.

How can changing the exhaust back pressure affect the amount of exhaust
that get's run back through the engine? 

Finally, 944 turbos have knock sensors. If detonation occurs, the ECU
is supposed to handle that by retarding ignition.

Please straighten me out.
