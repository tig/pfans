Howdy,

I had a few things to sell, but I can't remember them right now, so I'll
list what I can remember:

Autothority (v2.2 or 2.5 I think they are) chips.  These are not the most 
recent chips, but these are not the head gasket chips either.  They operate
very well producing the power as seen on my dyno charts.  They are for the
Turbo S model or 89+ models.  I have two boost bolts to choose from, 1.0bar
or 1.1bar.  The chips came with the 1.1bar bolt.  If bought within the next
3 days, I'll throw in the K&N filter I used to test on the dyno which is
virtually new.  I'll even clean it with my K&N cleaner for you.

Total price = US$200.  I might have to add on a few dollars for shipping
if it's far.

I have a few other things to sell because I am preparing to buy my kart
and wanted to free up some money.  I'll still run the 944T in any thing
I can run it in, but I want that feel of a full-blown race car that only
a kart can give.

First come, first served.

Farzaan.
