Hi Group,

This is my first message, having just purchased an '86 951, 80K 
miles, about a month ago.  I found out that although I was told that 
the timing belt had been replaced at 60K, it had only been inspected, 
and found to be in good condition.  After reading PFan mail for 
a while,  I decided that the smart thing to do was to take it in and 
have the T belt and water pump replaced.  They replaced belts, pump, 
gaskets, tensioners, etc., and I drove away with piece of mind, 
knowing my baby had the proper PM.  

About 40 miles from the mechanic (I live about 80 miles away), I 
noticed a high-pitched "whistle" when the boost gauge got to about .7 
or .8, , got louder and higher pitched until the guage read about 1.2 
or so, and then after that I couldn't hear it.  I had read about new 
belts making noise, but does this sound like belt noise?  Also, when 
I bought the car, it idled about 1100RPM or so, which I thought might 
be a little high, After having it worked on,  I drove it about 65 
miles or so, and came to a stop before parking, the idle seemed to be 
erratic, between 7-800, I thought for a moment that it was going to 
die.  It was raining when I was driving home from the shop (the first 
time I've had her out in the wet stuff) and was wondering if that 
could have any effect.

I called the shop owner this morning, and after talking to the 
mechanic, he said it was probably belt noise, but the more I 
described it, the more he thought about Turbo problems.  I can't get 
it back to the shop until Monday, when my wife is off work.

My question is, are the noise and low idle connected, and if so, is 
there something they could have screwed up by doing the belt job?  Or 
does this sound like belt noise, and am I worrying for nothing?  
Except for the lower idle,(which isn't always that low) the car seems 
to run as perfectly as when I took it in.     

Thanks in advance for any help,

Jim Crow
