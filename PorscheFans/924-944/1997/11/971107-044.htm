I have recently acquired a '94 968 with the M030 Club Sport Chassis which
appears to have adjustable yellow Koni shocks.  No P-literature that came
with the care gives any information on adjusting these shocks. Is this
adjustment doable (is that a word?) by the home mechanic or does it require
shock removal (my definition of not doable by me)?  The ride seems firm (too
firm for comfortable street ride much of the time) compared to my past
experience with a 944 and 944T which both had optional sports suspensions.
 Is there a way to tell by looking if the shocks are already set in their
softer or firmer adjustment?  Any info regarding experience with this type of
shock setup would be greatly appreciated.  I believe other aspects of the
chassis setup are also adjustable (such as ride height).  If you anything
about these adjustments, it would also be helpful.

Thanks,
Andy
