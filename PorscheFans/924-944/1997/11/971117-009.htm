According to one of my books:
By the time the 924 testing programme was under way, it had already been
decided that a VW engine would power the car - one that itself was in it's
early development stages at the Audo Research centre at Ingolstadt.
Code-named EA831, it was an extensively developed version of the
four-cylinder engine that had been introduced in 1965.  This unit would also
end up in the VW LT van and the Audi 100.
