Nick,

We've been trying to find a cop with a radar gun to clock us, but they
refuse to sit in a hot air balloon as we swoop by.  :)  Actually,
terminal in standard freefall (open body position) is accepted to be
120.  Tracking (arms back, legs exteneded body relatively flat to earth)
produces much forward speed and a terminal of near 150 (less drag). 
While a head down dive (same body position,pointed straight down) lowers
the drag area with the same mass and increases velocity to 200+.  This
is all according to Skydiving magazine a while back, as like I
said....no radar guns at my drop zone.  The reason a bird swooping can't
reach the same terminal has to do with our mass versus the surface area
of our head and shoulders (frontal surface area) versus the mass and
drag of your average swooping chicken. Of course, I can't find a falcon
willing to race me either.  :)

Oh, the obligatory Porsche info :::  I just discovered a cracked exhaust
manifold to go with my head gasket trouble.  When it rains it pours?

Bill
