As I reported a month or so ago, my 1985.5 944's temperature guage
consistently hovers around the 2/3rds mark (visit
http://www.ruffolo.com/944/problems for a diagram). I don't think that the
guage is faulty because it starts off reading cool. Then, as I drive, it
gradually rises normally until it stabilizes around the 2/3rds mark.

This is ALWAYS the case even when cruising on the expressway! In fact, the
engine temperature even rises a little at high speeds. This doesn't make
any sense to me--especially since its been pretty cold here in Chicago
(dipping into the teens last week).

I've recently replaced the thermostat, waterpump, engine temperature sensor
and fuel pressure regulator (to alieviate a rich mixture). I even added a
bottle of Red Line Water Wetter to no avail.

The electric cooling fan seems to be working (At least I hear it running
for a few moments after the car is shut off). Perhaps it is not running as
long as it should and I should replace the switch--or the perhaps the
relay. However, this doesn't explain why the engine still runs hot when
cruising at high speeds.

So what's my problem? I had my local dealer ensure that all air was bled
from the system. Might I have an internally clogged radiator?

It might help to know that the previous owner let the timing belt go until
it broke. So I know the car had a complete valve job about a year and a
half ago. Is it common for an engine to permanently run hot after having
major work like this done? I don't know.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice.

Thanks,
NEIL
