Being one of the more vocal folks on this list complaining about balance
belt whine, I find this very interesting.  When I went in for a retension
via the gauge, the mechanic and I examined the belt area with the cover
off and observed the belt was 'floppy' loose.  He suspects the previous
shop I used loosened the belt from spec to eliminate the whine.  It was
indeed beautifully silent when I brought it in.  Your shop is sticking its
neck out by admitting what they are doing - and making themselves liable
in the unlikely event the belt jumps a tooth or whatever, despite good
intentions.  My shop refused to tension the balance belt outside the
specification.. only to the looser end of the spec (2.0 +/- .3).  He set
it to 1.8.  The specification has such close tolerance it made no
difference in the noise. 

I am just about ready to go in there and loosen the balance belt tension
_slightly_ to at least reduce the noise.  I'm not risking much.. if the
balance belt jumps a tooth, it's not the end of the world (not so for the
camshaft belt!!!).   I certainly wouldn't do this to a track car, or one 
driven at high rpm's for extended periods.

When I get brave on a day off and decide to do this, I'll inform the list 
as to my results.  Don't hold your breath.  ;-)
