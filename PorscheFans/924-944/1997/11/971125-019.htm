Hello P-Fans
	I just recently changed my trans fluid to SWEPCO, it was blue/green in
color! SWEPCO (80/90wt) also was fairly thick in viscosity compared to the
old fluid (BG Syncro Shift, 75/90wt). The factory fill Porsche G-50 trans
fluid looks like corn/vegtable oil, thin in viscosity (pours like 5W-30 motor
oil!), G-50 also sells for $35 a liter! All in all, I like the SWEPCO, it has
stopped that "rattling noise at idle) from the trans, and performs well on
cold warm ups. 

					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
