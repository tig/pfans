Ok .. I'm really desparate at this point to figure this problem out .. here
is the situation .. 

the players .. 

1 1983 944
1 haynes manuel
1 frustrated porsche fan

The problem....

I have no high speed cooling fan .. the second AC fan does not come on at
all .. 

What do I know...

The AC second fan is operating .. I have put juice to it and it runs

The primary cooling fan is operating I have jumped out a cooling fan relay
to allow it to run at high speed

I have checked the relays under the glove box .. one is a two pole AC
relay(second one in to the right) the other is a single pole relay .. if
anyone knows what is suppose to be here and in what position each relay is
in I would appreciate it .. 

The thermosensor is working .. because the primary fan does come on through
the resistor across the cooling fan relay

any help would GREATLY be appreciate .. I would like to know when the fans
come on .. the primary I know comes on when the engine coolant reaches a
certain temp .. but what of the other fan .. only when the ac is on??
(which it doesn't do) ... or when the AC is on and the coolant closes the
thermosensor?? (which it also does not do ) .. 

Thanks

Rich
