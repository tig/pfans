The heat is constantly on. This is fine for the winter, but by
spring I'll want to have this cleared up ;-)  The blower fan works fine,
but the temperature control doesn't have any effect. I started to remove
the center console, but that looks like a full-day project -- my mechanic
described it as "kindof medieval behind there." What can I look for in
the engine compartment?

Any help appreciated.

Dear Steve & P-Fans
	I would suspect that the "heater control valve" either has a vacuum leak
(internally) or that the vacuum line going to the heater valve has come off
or not supplying vacuum to the unit. The heater control valve is located at
the rear of the engine, above the clutch bell housing. The valve is "T" into
one of the thumb size rear heater hoses, it has a round diaphragm with a
vacuum line attached. This valve is made of two pieces of plastic glued
together - they always leak coolant onto the clutch area. I would check this
ASAP! The space behind the engine is really tight - I would make the repairs
with engine cold. 

								Good Luck, davidjalai@aol.com
