Wow, the tone of the list has really changed in a couple of days. I hope it
has passed by the time this gets there. I had just been thinking a few days
ago that it would be nice if the list made a move away from quite so much R
and R questions(not that I mind them...I've ask plenty of my own... it
would just be good to hear some good Pcar stories from daily life) but this
is not exactly what I had in mind. Maybe everyone should go to their
respective corner, sponge off and come out and shake hands. Its probably a
full moon or the planets are not aligned properly or some other logical
explanation. Maybe we needed an adjustment it just didn't coincide with the
stock market.
