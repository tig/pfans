I don't understand the logic here.  Are they saying that there's so little
travel in the belt tensioner that it can't compensate for a 1 mm change?
And why would the belt have to be changed more often if tension is within
specs (??).

BTW, did they give you an estimate of what the compression ratio would be
after decking the head 1 mm?  And whether you'd have to playing w/ the
ignition timing? Too bad the late '85 doesn't have knock sensors.  Would be
useful for backing off on the timing just in case the compression got
fairly high.

I don't recall offhand what the Euro compression ratio was, but I wonder
whether the Euro DME had different mapping.
