"I've heard that the engine is was used in a V.W van, an AMC Gremlin, and =
Sprite? Is this true? and if so, these parts should be
easy to get and a lot cheaper right?"

Yes part of your 924 engine is the same as the Gremlin engine (the cast
iron block)  However this is where the similarity ends.  If my memory
serves me correctly the head on the 924 was made by Porsche and is made of
aluminum.  Also fuel injection is different(Gremlins were carborated) as
well as possibly some internal components.  I actually owned a Gremlin once
and actually liked the ugly beast.  I had a mechanic once try to tell me
that the 924 engine was identical to the VW Van and were made by VW and
then sold to Porsche,  he then proceeded to tell me that he "knew" all the
parts were interchangeable.  I haven't been back there since.  I find it
odd that these guys tell you the 924 isn't a "real Porsche" until you go to
buy parts then if you confront them about the cost they say "hey its a
Porsche,  what do you expect".  If anyone can contradict my info feel free
as I am always willing to learn.
