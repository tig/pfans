Wow if this does not get you a lot of mail nothing will.


Reasons to downshift:
1.	You are no longer in the power band of the motor on the low side
2.	You like to hear the motor scream
3.	You want to take advantage of trailing throttle oversteer 
4.	You are braking and need to be in the right gear to continue on.
Examples:
	1 .	Basically your car has a narrow power band and you want
to keep your car in that band (For example: My 914's band is
3200-5100rpm)
	If I am coming out of a corner and keeping the car in 4th will
put be below 3200, I downshift to x which will keep me in that 3-5k
range
2.	Some times you just want see what the rev limiter will do, or
you just have too much money and think it's time for all new vales.
3.	You can use the torque of the motor to move weight from front to
back of the car, in some 911's this is done to create a spinning top
effect.
4.	Ok we just came down from 130mph to take this 30mph turn, lets
get ready to go by being in the right gear.


	That a short start the list will keep them going for a while

	PS: when down shifting more than one gear, walk the Trans
through them ex. Rather than 5th to 2nd  go 5-4-3-2 sounds like work but
real $ saver.

	Hi all
	I'd like to learn more about the proper way to downshift. The
procedure I
	understand and am practicing the technique. But will someone
enlighten me
	as to when appropriate to downshift. When coming to a stop or
only when
	proceeding on in a lower gear?
