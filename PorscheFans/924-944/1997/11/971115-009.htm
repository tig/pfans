Rosaleen,

You found out something that all Porsche owners learn about after time:

Some Porsche dealers are good, and some are BAD!  A dealership does not
automatically confer technical excellence, despite all the advertising.

To avoid this problem in the future, you need to speak with as many other
Prosche owners as you can find, preferably ones that own your model, and ask
who they trust to service their car.  You will hear the same name come up
several times.  Go to that shop and check it out.  See that is neat and
clean, and talk to the service manager before you need service.  Explain
your situation, and be sure that he knows what issues you are sensitive to,
and where you are going in your Porsche ownership.

If they seem like they are supportive and understand your position, take
your car in for a minor service of some sort and see how they do.  On top of
the service, you are also looking for some proactive comments like "While
adjusting your idle, I noticed that the fan belts are cracking.  They may
not need to be replaced now, but keep an eye on them and they should last
another 5,000Km."  Notice that they did NOT say replace them NOW!  You want
a dealer who will partner with you to keep your car in service and you happy
over the long term.

If they perform to your liking, then there's your dealer.

Good Luck!

PS: Remember that 924s are getting old, and expensive repairs, especially
for a high-mileage one are pretty much inevatable.  If you're feeling
overwhelmed, sell the car and make some more $$ to get your more-current
911.
