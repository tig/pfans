Actually, the 2.7l had only 2 horsies more than the 2.5l. :) 165hp, that is.
The torque was raised from 151lb ft at 3500rpm to 166lb ft at 4200rpm
though, which apparently was considered quite an improvement.

It seems the Euro and US 2.7l models have the same compression, 10.9:1. Did
I say 10.9:1 for the 2.5l before? Hmm.. If I did, I was wrong. I mean to say
10.6:1.
