the sliding around a wet parking lot thing is amateur, but it served the
purpose of getting safe seat time on (and beyond) the limits until I can
get a car to go autocrossing with...

Daniel,

Your 944 is probably, out of the box, one of the best autocross cars ever=

built.  A halfway decent set of rubber and your ready to rumble.  If it h=
as
too much sway or nose dive for your taste, talk to Jason at Paragon
Products.  He can fix you up with set of adjustable Konis and stiffer fro=
nt
springs.  Our S2 was close to stock and turned times equal to some of the=

prepared iron.  Unfortunately my partner turned those times.  Join your
local PCA and sign up for driving school then head for the a-x track.  It=

is the most fun you can have with your clothes on

As for transaxle toss, it happened to me about 5 years ago.  I'm cruising=

my turbo down the freeway at night at about 70 and the car suddenly pitch=
es
to one side.  I correct back and forth and finally get it under control. =

There was no reason for it happening other than a slightly off camber
sweeping turn.  I had the car checked out and no problem was found.  The
tires were good, but I replaced them shortly thereafter.  It never happen=
ed
again.  I have never had anything like this happen at the track either ev=
en
with some of the stupid things I do.  One of the great unsolved mysteries=
