I have a couple of paintwork/body questions.

1) The (clear?) stoneguards on the sills of the car have taken
quite a beating over the years. I read (in the haynes) that these
are clear plastic guards that can be removed with a little heat.
Is this true? Is replacement possible for the home mech?
Has anyone done this? The hayned suggests a hair dryer for removing
them- I certainly wouldn't want to use anything hotter.

2) Someone (**** idiot) has opened their door onto my pristine
front fender and left a white (on my maroon paint!) mark on
the panel (luckily not damaged). Can this be removed using
a polish or cutting agent. I NEVER polish the car only wax
as the PO was fanatical about scratching off layers of paint
with those stupid car washers. Can someone recommend a method
and what product to use?

3) Well not really a body question but the wheels (black center
with chrome rim-Fuschs?) have what appears to be severe oxidation
on the chome rim. (possibly from sitting idle covered in crap for ages)
Can anyone recommend a product to clean up the chrome (and remove
old rim balance weight adhesive tape) from the chrome, or should
I entrust this job to a "professional" wheel service?

Thanks
