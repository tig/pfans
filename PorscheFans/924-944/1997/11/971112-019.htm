Mr WOT needs to review his earlier posting :
 
>>If you removed EVERY electronic gizmo between the wastegate
and a feed off the intake (in our car, the banjo bolt on the intercooler
piping after the turbo), your car would make 0.2bar boost. <<

How could you make this statement? Where did you get this information?

Your way wrong here Farzaan, boost regulation on the 951 is controlled by char
ge pressure action on the wastegate diaphragm. The wastegate spring in the
951 is capable of allowing boost pressure in excess of 1.5 bar ( 2.5
absolute).  

Quoting from publication WKD 491 321, 944 Turbo Information Technik, page 33:

If there is no electric power on the cycling valve, opening R (return flow)
remains closed. The complete charging air pressure builds up above the
diaphragm in the charging air pressure control valve (wastegate).  The valve
opens the bypass line and and the turbocharger receives only a small amount
of the hot exhaust gas so that it no longer rotates so quickly and the chargin
g air pressure drops

This document states elsewhere that if there is electric power to the cycling
valve, the charge pressure from line C (intercooler boost line) is vented to
the intake side of the turbo, and there is high charging air pressure. Based
on the intake manifold signal (boost or vacuum), the KLR uses square wave
signals to regulate the duty cycle of the cycling valve. 

Try this experiment: remove the charge pressure line banjo bolt from the
intercooler and plug the intercooler pipe. (slip a small piece of 3/8 fuel
line over the holes in the banjo bolt and screw it back into the pipe).
 Drive the car.  You will observe boost pressure of approximately .75 bar
(1.75 absolute) before the overboost circuit built into the DME-KLR starts to
cut the fuel as a safety precaution (this limit will be even higher if the
car is chipped).  This is proof positive that the wastegate spring is not
restricted to 0.2 Bar !

>>You will notice in the 944T, it does not make full boost pressure when
chipped in 1st or 2nd gear because of this wastegate getting signal
problem..<<

There is no problem here.....the full boost is restricted for reasons of
engine and transmission longevity, fuel availability and the fact that the
951 had 5/50k powertrain warranty when it first came out!!  This was acheived
by turbo compressor sizing  and software mapping. Or if you believe
Autothority, airflow sensor restriction. 

You also make equally erroneous statements about Porsche's boost control
system (really Bosch's) as being antiquated and not up to current technology.
 Hmm.....lets see....the 993 twin turbo, the current Audi turbo's, SAAB
turbo's all use that same system only updated to current computer technology
and tailored for each engine's individual characteristics.

Next time you decide to bless the list with a tech series based on conjecture
and home brewed suppositions regarding the technical aspects of these cars,
remember that there are plenty of knowledgable people on the list that don't
always have the time to offer advice or clear up misconceptions regarding
these cars.  Incorrect information is worse than no information.

This is not meant to flame Mr WOT, but to offer the list members correct
information and a better understanding of these awsome cars.
