Hi Terry,
A while back - browsing through the local parts emporium I noticed that
they stocked both "Monroe" and "Gabriel"(Parts Master brand?) shocks for
the NA 944 also the turbo without the M030/M474 setup.  The Monroe front
shocks were about $45CDN and lifetime warranted. I do not remember the
prices on the rears.  What I subsequently discovered was that the "Monroes
look identical to the more expensive "Boges" right down to the welds.  If
you want something inexpensive that will do the job and costs less than
used, than check these out.(BTW used shocks, unless they are near new or
"Konis" or equivalent and can be rebuilt/revalved should not be an option
IMO.)   The "Monroe" fronts look to be inserts for the stock struts, I
believe.
