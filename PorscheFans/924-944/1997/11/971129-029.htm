        Ok, wel,l here I sit at the office. I smelled gas leaking on the
way in, so when I got here I popped the hood. One of the two gas lines
going up from the metal fuel lines on the side of the engine compartment to
the injection system is leaking at the bottom end of the hose, so the
gasoline was dripping on the engine compartment heat shield about an inch
from the exhaust headers, with the engine turned off. Those headers were
hot.
        There is a large diameter reinforcing hose that fits around the
actual gas line. It was zip-tied to the other gas line. I cut the zip tie
and think I might be able to wiggle the oversize hose down far enough so
that the gas leaks outside of the engine compartmentso I can get the car
back home and arrange to get a replacment gas line. I decided to not
further mess with the line right now while the car is hot.
        If anyone has a good idea to keep me and Mr. 951 from doing a Roman
Candle act (one suggestiion being leave the car here at work), I'd love to
hear from you today.

Thanks,
