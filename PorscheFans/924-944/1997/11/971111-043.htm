I am still looking for some help as to what you think a 1982 924 with 20,000
miles is worth. You have to see this car to believe it. The original sticker
,which I have listed it at 18,000 and was purchased for 15,000 in 1982. To
give you an idea on how original This car is it still has the factory tires.
The car has every service record. From 1982 to 1985 the car was driven 15,000
miles and from 1985 to today the car has been driven 5,000 miles.The interior
and paint are original and look like showroom condition. I want to sell and
trade up to a 911.
