Well, I just started om my second clutch replacement job (first the 924S
and 
now the 944, the joys of Porsche ownership) when I noticed something
strange. The left drive shaft (half shaft?) has apparently been replaced
at
some time and is smaller in diameter than the right shaft, the (newer)
left 
shaft is 24 mm in diameter and the right shaft is 27 mm. Has there been
a
change in these parts?

On the clutch replacement, the drive 12 point shaft bolts could be
loosened
without a problem and I didn't strip any heads. When I removed the
starter 
I already had bits of rubber falling out, when I drove the car it had
all the 
normal symptoms. I estimate that it will take me about 6 hours total to
remove the exhaust, tranny and bellhousing. Is this a reasonable
assumption for an experienced mechanic? 

Does anybody know whether the motor mounts on a 1989 944 2.7L are
hydraulic? There have been three types of motor mounts and as far as
I can tell the 944 has the second version of the motor mounts. My 924S
had the first version and I had to replace those with the third version
(the 
non-hydraulic turbo mounts). On my 944 the right hand side motor mount 
does seem to be compressed a little bit more than on the left hand side 
but that makes sense because the engine is canted over in that 
direction. The area around the mount is clean and I don's see traces of
fluid, however I do have some vibration at idle. It's probably better to

replace the clutch first and then see if the vibration is gone. The
engine 
has 160.000km on it but is extremely clean, in fact it is much cleaner
than the engine in my 924S with 100.000km (rebuilt that one a couple 
of months ago, clutch was easy on that one because I had the engine 
out).

Thanks in advance.

Paul
