Hi,
I am having some troubles with my '84 944 and I thought I'd query
the list to see if this problem sounds familiar before I spend a
lot of time looking under the hood.

I was accelerating moderately hard in 2nd gear and was upshifting to 3rd 
when the engine silently lost a lot of power.  It felt as though the car 
was running on 1 or 2 cylinders.  The exhaust note changed and has gotten 
a little louder.  The car sounds like an old British sports car now with 
a distinct 'braapp' note when the gas pedal is pressed.  The idle speed 
wavers around 300-500 rpm and the acceleration is flat with no stumbling
or bucking.  I managed to drive the car 5 blocks to my garage where it 
has sat since.

I checked the timing and the belt hasn't jumped a tooth. There's nothing
obvious amiss under the hood -- the plugs are seated, ignition wires
and distributor cap are connected, and there's no obvious sign of
disconnected or cracked intake hoses.  The car recently had the fuel
and air filter changed, and has 68k miles.  Does this sound familiar
to anyone?  With the exhaust note change, I was thinking 'trashed
valves' but the timing is fine and the car still runs.
