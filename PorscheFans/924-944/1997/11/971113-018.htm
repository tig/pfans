I believe that Tom P. inquired about drilled rotors for the Turbo S.  Yes,
the 968 M030 rotors are drilled.  Actually, they were cast with holes by the
oem vendor.  Porsche dealers sell these.  They have 965 part numbers, as they
were also used on 965 cars (C2 930's?).

These rotors bolt/screw right onto the Turbo S hubs.  They are not cheap.  I
paid about $200/rotor, and I pay about $75-80 per rotor at the dealer for the
normal Turbo S parts.  With the normal parts, I pay an additional $40/rotor
for gas slot machining. Why did I try the drilled units?  Because, with two
drivers and a heavy car, I am looking for all of the cooling I can get.

Here are the detes:

Car: '87 951 with agressive mods for the track (chip, suspension, etc), but
at full weight.

Brakes: Like the rest of the car, Turbo S parts.  Cool brake ducting.  Pagid
orange or Performance Friction 90 compound pads.  928s brake bias valve to
use more of rear brakes.  Motul 600 brake fluid bled frequently.

Slotted rotor experience:

After 1-2 track weekends (two drivers), despite agressive cool-down laps,
rotors would warp.  Thickness would be 30-31 mm.  Turning brings them down to
minimum, and then they warp again.

Drilled rotor experience:

These held up for 5-6 weekends in a similar use scenario.  The holes showed
cracking after 3-4 events.  Thickness got down to 31.5 mm when the cracks got
too dangerous.  Recently returned to PCNA for Warranty replacement.  Will let
you know if they replace 'em free.

Conclusion:

Toss-up at this point.  Need more data.

Incidentally, I have found that Jeff Stone at KMR is a good advisor on brakes
for the track.  He suggests that you should have your rotors surfaced on a
mill (not a lathe) for optimum performance between races.  This advice is
obviously for full out racers.
