Feloow Porschefans:

If the 2.0 ltr engine in my 924 is actually an Audi. Why do they
want so much more for the 924 parts, than if it was an Audi, or VW part?

For that matter if I went into a V.W. dealer and asked for engine
parts for a VW van. Would I get a better deal, than what I would pay for =
the exact same "Porsche" part?

I've heard that the engine is was used in a V.W van, an AMC Gremlin, and =
Sprite? Is this true? and if so, these parts should be
easy to get and a lot cheaper right?

If there is a parts book available that cross-references these parts to =
the other makes, and models could someone tell me and/or the group where =
to buy it. I want to rebuild an engine this winter, but $129.00 U.S. for =
a head gasket, $320.00 U.S. for rings?? Is it that much harder to make =
Porsche parts than any other makes parts that sell for 1/4 the cost?

About ten miles from where I live, is a factory that makes automotive rin=
gs, and bearings. I should go into business with them and make Porsche =
parts <grin>

Thanks for the band width...

I'll get back to those of you inquired about the 924 parts. As soon
as it's about zero, I'll go out and start tearing the poor car apart. *L*
