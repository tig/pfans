Hi all:

    Well I have fixed the fluxuating idle problem, it ended up being
nothing more than a simple idle adjustment. Once it was adjusted down about
1 turn the problem dissappeared has not come back .. 

   Now the cooling fan problem really has me stumped .. from what I have
been able to gather I was never getting any "high" spped fan operation, it
seems the relay never came in .. from what I have as a circuit diagram, the
thermsensor is ok because I get the low speed fan .. but that is also
suppose to bring in the relay .. I have tried the OEM relay (1 pole) .. and
using the "AC" relay. But they both have differant pins for the relay coil.
as of now I have taken an old cooling fan relay and jumped it out .. which
at least gives me the high speed fan, the second fan is still not comming
in at all :( .. If anyone has the workshop manuels with a schematic of this
cirucuit and how it ties into the AC circuit .. I would really appreciate
if you could either scan it and send it .. or fax it to me .. it would
really help me alot in shooting down this problem .. 

Thanks

Rich
