I just use the mileposts and average at least 5 (preferably 10 miles) to
minimize the error.  Of course 10 miles at 60mph is like torture, but I
found my previous ('87) 944 do be dead accurate, which I confirmed when
I got pulled over (and ticketed!) for doing 70 in a 65 zone.  I haven't
tried it with my current 944, so I can't tell you how accurate it is.
