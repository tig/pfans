Aubrey,

I doubt it is this simple but I'll pass on the info anyway.
 

I too was driving my 87 944 NA one day and all of
sudden I heard a "pop" and the gauges slowly went to
0 and I had no power.  I was in the same dilemma you
were in as to wether I should try to start it or not. 
Since I just had my timing belt, waterpump, etc
changed no more than a few weeks earlier, I went
ahead and started it.  It turned over, sounded normal
but wouldn't start.  Had it towed to a new shop
(different than the one that did my timing belt).  The
mechanic lifted the hood and smiled.  

When the other shop went to hook up my distributor,
they didn't have the 'J' hooks properly seated in the
housing and the distributor pooped off!  Hooked the
distributor back on and everything was fine.

Like I said, it may not be this simple, but unless you
are looking right at the distributor, it is hard to notice.
Especially if it is the lower 'J' hook is unlatched.   I
didn't see it when I looked at the engine!

Good Luck
Karl
