After calling the dealer and recovering from hearing the cost of a new rear
wiper motor/gearbox assembly ($250 with PCA discount - robbery!), I decided
to try my own repair.
 
As you recall, the fiber/bakelite gear is very soft, and the teeth wore off
in one spot, causing the worm gear to disengage and spin freely.
 
What I did to repair the gear follows.  I cleaned it several times with
solvent to remove all traces of grease.  After a thourough drying I
mixed some two part epoxy and carefully applied it to the worn out area,
filling in the area with the damaged teeth, so the profile of the epoxy
approximated the remaining good teeth.  Epoxy has the nice characteristic
of being fairly thick, and it cures without shrinking. After it cured, I
took a thin Dremel grinding wheel (whose width approximates the spaces
between the existing teeth) and carefully cut new grooves into the epoxy
to form new teeth.
 
I am going to let the epoxy cure for another day or so, grease the
contraption, then reassemble.  I have no idea how durable this will be. 
The glue may immediately fall off when I try it, or maybe it will last a
few months. I'll report back later this week. 

In any event, I would recommend to folks as part of a major maintenance 
to take off the cover of your rear wiper motor and grease the gears.  
There was water in my unit and the grease was dried out, which looks like 
it accelerated the wear.  It is simple to do and can be done in less than 
half an hour.  It will run more quietly, too. Just be careful of the paper 
gasket or you will have to use some sort of sealant.
