This post contains some of my impressions of a recent S2 test drive.

Finally got to drive an S2 that seemed to be a good example of the model.
It was a cabriolet, which I expect was slower than a coupe due to the
110lb (I think) weight differential.  

Still, this car was fun.  Much better low end torque than my old S,
reminded me of the 944 NA in it willingness to pull from idle speed.  (My
old S and the Turbos that I have driven do not quite pull as nice from low
rpm).  Much diminished was the rush experienced around 4krpm on the S and
the upper range does not give you the feeling of the T.  Simply, this car
is very drivable and deceptive, due to the lack of rush probably, of the
speed it generates. I can only imagine the experience to get better with
an LSD, sport suspension and tires that are more up to the task.

This completely nullifies the experience I had with a sleepy 1991 S2.
Even more strongly than before I feel that S2 had problems.
