The Turbo S sport Konis are single adjustable units which are valved a little
stiffer than the regular 951 sport units.  As you know, they lack a welded-on
lower spring perch.  They use a finely-threaded aluminum perch, and the
springs are shorter, stiffer and tapered as compared to the normal 951 sport
units.  You can buy threaded collars to accept 2 1/2 inch spring to fit over
regular 951 sport Koni's.  This will give you easy ride height adjustablility
for the front.  Carrera sells a nice coil over kit, and their springs are
quite nice.  You can probably get a kit cheaper from Ground Control in Rancho
Cordova.  They sell a generic coil-over/perch assembly.  Here are some
prices:

Coil-over/perches: $50 @
2 1/2" Eibach springs: $65 @
Camber plates (bolt-in): $250/pair

Their camber plates are a lot cheaper than the KMR units (which I have) and
bolt right in.  The Carrera camber plates require you to cut you shock tower
sheet metal.

The Club Sprort Koni's are similar to the Turbo S units.  I bought them at a
swap meet for $20 each.  They are worth a lot more than that.  They allow for
bump adjustment in addition to rebound adjustment.  Since they were used, I
had them revalved at Truechoice, in Hilliard, OH.  They used valving from
their R&D files from Firestone Firehawk racing cars.  I'm not sure how this
valving compares to what Porsche specified as stock for the Turbo S.

Good luck with your project.
