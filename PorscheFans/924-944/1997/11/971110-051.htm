G. Muncey, on the subject of oil change intervals; I agree that changing
oil every 3,000 miles is excessive (assuming no severe, i.e. track, usage).
 I used to change it at this interval for a while and found that the old
oil was awfully clean looking (using Mobil 1).  I have now doubled that
interval and am confident that I'm not significantly impacting durability. 
Also, you might want to check a Consumer Reports from a few months ago in
which several oils (synthetic and non) were tested in taxi fleet service in
NYC.  They used 60 taxis in which the engines were torn down,
inspected/measured before the test and then after 60,000 miles.  There were
60 cars involved so I believe their results are statistically supportable. 
They also looked at oil change intervals and compared 3,000 mile vs. 6,000
mile intervals.  The results of all this showed no significant
(statistically speaking) difference in measurable wear for these two
intervals.  Also, they could find no significant difference in wear between
synthetics and good quality mineral oil (i.e. Valvoline) when changed at
these intervals.  They did admit that one item largely missing from this
testing was the effect of cold starting on wear; the taxis almost never
shut off!  This is the one area where synthetics really shine over mineral
oils since oil starvation due to thick oil is most certainly detrimental to
engine life.

I live in a warm climate and so am not too concerned about cold starts,
however, I still use the Mobil 1 as a bit of an insurance policy.  I figure
that the increased oxidation resistance of synthetics might buy me some
extra margin in case I ever overheated the engine.
