All,
In my search for info on Bilsteins vs. Koni's, I just got this email from
Mike (Mahler9th) regarding the subject, and thought it would be good info for
the list.

and Milledge suggest Koni, with one caveat from Jon.  He told me that you
have to strongly resist the temptation to fiddle with the bump and rebound
settings.  You can drive yourself crazy.  What he did when he was managing an
IMSA team was put Bilsteins in the front (custom valved) and Koni's in the
rear, so that they couldn't outsmart themselves.
 
 No one I've spoken to likes the Bilsteins on a 951 or 944, with the possible
exception of some full out racers.  Too stiff.  If I were you, I'd invest in
the Koni's, and probably buy them from Paragon (Jason Burkett).  A friend
just recently did some pricing research, and found his prices were the best.
 I use a set of Club sport Koni double adjustables up fron, and Koni sport
968 M030 units in the rear. The latter have perches for helper springs so
that I can increase my rear spring rate without pulling the torsion bars.
 
 I also have a set of Koni Turbo S sport shocks which I put on the car in the
winter.  Why have a super stiff ride in the rainy months when I am not AXing
or driving on the track?
