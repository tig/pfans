Paul,

>Congratulations! I know your son will rest easier knowing you now have
>your own playtoy. :-)

Actually, it might be the other way around!  Every time I drove his car I
was paranoid something bad might happen and I'd have to explain to him =
why
someone ran into his gorgeous car.

>With instant on radar, detectors are only good at telling you about some
>other poor fool who is getting clocked.

That's my feeling too.  I have an old Passport from Cincinnati Microwave
that I used in my Audi for years until it quit working reliably.
Occasionally I would get a beep or two and then nothing, followed by a
couple more beeps.  Eventually, I'd see the guy coming at me.  Once this
happened on a 2-lane road, and I had slowed down and just as the cop got
to me he zapped me big time.

>I recommend setting the cruise control (yeah, I normally hate them too)
>exactly 14 mph faster than the speed limit. My experience has been that
>most cops will give you up to that point on the interstates.

Boy, that is "fast."  You really can cruise at 89 mph in the Western
states that have 75 limits?  I will admit that 90 in a turbo S seems
awfully slow on the interstate.

>If you are going to get a radar detector, get the Valentine One

This does look like the best, but also the most expensive.  For this trip
I guess I will have to weigh the chances of getting a ticket against the
$400 price of the Valentine One.  I've made several 6000 mile trips in =
the
Audi and have rarely seen any patrol cars on the interstates, but I =
wasn't
cruising at 90 or above either.

>But that's for the boring interstates. I _really_ recommend you revise

>speed cruising. Hwy 50 - the loneliest highway in America - is perfect
>for crossing Nevada and the flats of Utah. And it is simply gorgeous

I'll check out the maps and see what I can come up with.  I'm trying to
avoid any chances of running into a snow storm since the car I will be
driving has rear tires that will need to be replaced shortly after I get
home.  Either that or I should do them before the trip, but I hate to
"waste" 3K of tread life on my first long trip.  On the other hand, new
tires would instill some confidence for the trip also.

I think the main reason for sticking to the interstates on this trip is I
will be driving a car of unknown reliability.  I'd hate to be cruising in
the boonies of Nevada or Utah and have the car quit on me.  I'll have
plenty of time for nice trips when I get home :-)
