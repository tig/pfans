Bummer about the old man hitting you.

The "raised rivets" on the rear hatch glass are probably "tong marks" from
manufacturing.  This piece of glass is one of the top two or three most
difficult to make, and it has generally been made in a "tong furnace" where
the glass panel is held at the top by a set of tongs, while the sides are
pressed into shape by this thing that looks like a big version of those
pressers dry cleaners use to iron shirts.  The marks in my 944 have been
there from the start, and are clearly tong marks.

Don't know about the rim turning from black to silver.  That can happen to
both aluminum and polymer glass frames if they are flexed....and I know the
944 hatch can flex under normal circumstances...but it wold have to be one
heck of a weird whack to bend the rim that far without cracking the glass.

Good luck,

Marty
