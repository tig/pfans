Pfans,

A while back there was some discussion about converting an S2 engine to
that of a 968, and getting the variable cam timing of the 968 by exchanging
as few parts as possible.  Jim Pasha had some comments on this topic that
might be of interest.  I believe George B. is also of the same opinion.

Would appear that, once more, seemingly straightforward approaches to power
cost more than you would hope.
