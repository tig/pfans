Attach your address for personal replies. Wanted to provide a little input,
but it doesn't warrant a PFans post.

Replace the T/As as soon as they start to wear. Had them on a Mustang once,
and they seemed to have little sidewall stiffness and a fairly rounded
profile, enhancing understeer.  If you want to decrease understeer,
increase tire pressure in the front, not the rear.  The Boges are pretty
soft. Had those on my S2, and the handling was unpredictable. You might
consider Konis.  You're not imagining the understeer, but it takes some
money to correct.
