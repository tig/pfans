I own a 1986 951 that I purchased to drive to work daily and time trial
monthly to improve my driving skills.  It is stock except for rollbar,
5-point belts and camber bar.  Existing street tires are stock sizes of 215
and 225 on 16 inch phone dial wheels.  I am removing 1/16" of tread at each
track weekend and boy -- do they squeal at the limit of adhesion.  For new
street tires, D40 M2s appear to be the list favorite so I'll give them a try.

Now I need track tires!  (getting hooked)  I just purchased a second set of
phone dials and I plan to purchase BF Goodrich R1s based upon past posts that
I have saves from the list.  I would like to increase tire sizes but since
the stock suspension permits considerable body lean, I am hesitant to
increase to 225 and 245 and have the tires scrape the body.  Dies anyone know
whether this is a possibility?

TIA Claus
