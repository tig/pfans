Hi all,

Today I started to remove my engine.  After 5 hrs, I've gotten pretty
close.  I just have to drop the exhaust, remove the crossmember and pull
the engine out.  I recently did a compression test, the numbers ranged
from 110 to 145 psi.  I did a leak down on the first cylinder, and was
awarded with a 45% on #1.  This would have given me a F in school, it
also gives my engine an F. (I did not bother checking the rest of the
cylinders)

Along the way I encountered a disturbing finding (well... besides the
engine).  When draining the coolant to remove the radiator, I removed
the turbo thermostat w/ housing from the waterpump to remove all the
water in the engine.

The housing didn't have a full passage through it.  Meaning that the
housing didn't have an opening to allow water to the turbo.  I changed
the waterpump in Feb.  When I did that I changed the housing for the
turbo thermostat.  I never really looked at the housing when I put it
on, I assumed that it was the same as the one I removed.  The body of
the housing is suppose to have a hole where the hose connection attaches
to.  There was no hole in my housing, but there was a hose connection.

Anyway, here it is Nov, and 3 track events later.  I've gone through
possibly two turbos, and extensive engine damage.  I doubt it is all
related to the housing, but for those who have changed the pumps
themselves, or/and have had turbo problems you might want to check this
out.
