Bart,

If the leak is above the exhaust manifold, then oil is probably leaking
from the cam shaft housing.  It is either leaking from the housing to
cylinder head gasket, or where the front camshaft housing cover
attaches  to the camshaft housing.  Both places have seals that may
allow oil past in later life.

I might be wrong, but I think there is a pressure valve located in the
head that releases pressure in the camshaft housing area.  If this has
failed you could have too much pressure in the housing, forcing oil out.

---fixes?---

You could try torquing all the camshaft bolts (6mm allen) to spec, and
see if that fixes the leak.

While replacing the seals is not particularly hard, they both require
slipping the timing belt off the camshaft sprocket.  If you've never
worked on the car before, you might have someone else walk you through
or do it for you.

The front camshaft housing cover is the easier of the two.  Requiring
you to remove the camshaft sprocket.  If you are careful you can get the
cam cover off from underneath the rear timing belt cover.

To replace the camshaft housing seal, you'll need to remove the intake
manifold, fuel rail, and the camshaft. (you might be able to get away
without removing the intake manifold)

Hope this helps.
