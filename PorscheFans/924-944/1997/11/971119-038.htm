Dear Pfans

Laser alignment of my front wheel tracking shows that the rear wheels are out 
of line with the front. I read in an earlier post some weeks back that this 
may be adjusted out by altering the rear adjustment on the trailing arms.  
Haynes suggests that there are three bolts on the arm connected with this 
adjustment. Is this right?
The wheel and tyre shop say that they will set the geometry if I explain which 
bolts alter the settings and if I ensure that the bolts are not seized.
They have been very good and their experienced mechanic had shown me the 
difficulties they have come across, and has patiently checked the work after I 
had gone back to the shop. If it can be done I feel that I can trust them to 
put this right.

Can anyone help with this otherwise it's an expensive visit to my Pdealer.
