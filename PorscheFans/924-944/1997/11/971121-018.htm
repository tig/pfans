Let me restate something that a list member occasionally adds to the end
of his message: "Don't lift".  These are rear wheel drive cars, your back
wheels were already lacking traction, lifting shifted more weight away
from the rear tires and reduced traction even further.  Couple that with
engine breaking effects, well you know what happens!!

At the autocross scene, I had people telling me my car would not be able
to overpower the rear tires (215).  Well, my 944S sure did.  I would not
be surprised if a 944 pushed at the limits would, too.  Be glad it was not
a 911, it would probably have been a multiple of 270 degrees worth of
spinning.

Do try the PCA track and autocross the car sometime, too.  The autocross
speeds are low (<50mph mostly) and there is only one car running at a time
(for all intents and purposes).  Events on a sealed surface (with the
black sealant used for driveways for example) are fun, you too can enjoy
the experience of holding the tail in with the throttle as the rear is
tracing an arc noticeably larger than the front and the sound from the
tires squealling is interesting.  And if you too have crappy Pirelli P500
tires on your car like my PO had installed, you can be looking at the
course from the side window at times :-))

And do try to get a video camera to film these excursions.
