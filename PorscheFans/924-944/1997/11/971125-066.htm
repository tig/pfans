Our fall driving school here at San Diego PCA cost $150, up $25 from the
previous spring one.  They are always sold out in advance.  It starts wit=

Saturday is all out driver training with skid pads, accident avoidance
simulator, limit braking, slalom or linked turns, increasing/decreasing
radius turns, pitch and catch (personal favorite), mini-autocross, and
corner worker instruction.  A water truck to make half the exercises real=

entertaining and breakfast and lunch.

Sunday is a practice untimed autocross.  You get far more seat time than =
a
regular a-x.  Kiss those tires goodbye!  Again breakfast and lunch.

Those who attended and have previously attended professional (big bucks)
schools were impressed with the quality and low price.  Having only
attended the PCA school, I was highly impressed with the instruction.  Yo=

spins.  =
