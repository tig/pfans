Andrew,

It is a little time consuming.  If you use yours for a daily driver I
would recommend getting everything together and then doing the work over
the weekend.  Otherwise, if you have a garage, just put it on stands and
work on it when you can.

The first time I pulled everything apart I took my time and made sure I
knew were everything went so I could put it back together.  So it took me
longer, the second time I pulled it apart, I pulled it apart in 2-3 Hours
and the same for putting it back together.  If you are a mechanic, it may
take you less time.

To answer your question about the window, I haven't got the foggiest idea
why they would say you need to take out the window.  I did not do it and
I did not have any problems.  I don't know why this is listed as a step. 
I assume you saw that in the Haynes Manual? Maybe it is too scare the
weak of heart.  Maybe somebody else on the list can help with the answer
to this question.

To answer your question regarding skill level, until I did this the only
thing I ever attempted on a car was too change the oil, spark plugs,
wires, etc..  Nothing major.  Although this is a major job it can be
accomplished with a little patient.  Also the only other thing I would
definitely recommend is having a transmission jack handy.  I did do all
of this work on my own (that is why I recommend a trans jack) otherwise
the trans axle is little tough to handle just sitting on the floor jack.

Hope this helps.

Jeff
