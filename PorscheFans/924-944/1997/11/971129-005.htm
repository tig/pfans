Dan raises a very good set of questions here and I think this is 
important for everyone.

Does the 16 valve engine have an automatic belt tensioner?

Yes, the 16 valve engines have the belt tensioner.  In fact, all engines 
from 1987 onward do.  However, the "Auto" is a bit of a misnomer.  If you 
study the design of the system you will see that the two bolts that clamp 
the tensioner in place will defeat the spring tensioner.  The best guess 
I have as to why the spring is even there is to aid in the set up of the 
belt tension.  Once the tension is set using special tool number 9200, 
tightening the bolts to specification effectively removes the spring from 
the equation.

On my Turbo, I have found that the spring only provided an initial 
tension of less than 1.8 on the gauge.  This was enough to allow a new 
belt to easily jump the cogs on the flywheel pulley.

There is an adjustment to the tensioner spring that would set the spring 
preload, but first, without the tension gauge you do not know to what 
value that has been set to.  Second, the initial set point for a new belt 
is 4.0 on the Porsche gauge.  After a run in of about 1500 miles, you 
should readjust the belt to 2.7.  Even if you adjust the spring preload 
to 2.7 and drop in a new belt, once the belt seats in and stretches it 
will quickly loosen and put you serious risk of engine damage.

I am not sure that I can stress strongly enough that the "automatic belt 
tensioner" does not in any way keep your belts in proper tension.  The 
only way to do that is to use the Porsche gauge, part number 9201, the 
calibration bar, part number 9201/2, and follow the tension settings I 
have posted above.  True, some mechanics set the belts by "feel", but 
those that are successful at this have done many, many such adjustments 
and probably rate very high on the intuition scale.

The general consensus for replacement intervals is 30,000 miles, although 
Porsche specifies 45,000 miles.  Periodic inspection of the belt will 
help spot potential problems such as oil leaks or premature belt failure. 
 Those intervals are purely up to your judgment.

As a side note.  The 16 valve engines have a separate timing chain that 
has a tensioner as well.  This tensioner does not require adjustment, but 
does have wear points on the plastic shoes that guide the chain.  This 
part lives under the cam cover and is both easily checked and replaced.  
The cost of the part is somewhat expensive, but the cost of a failure is 
at least one order of magnitude more expensive.
