Hi Folks,
	I plan on doing some track events soon in my 86 951 and I have
heard that is is a good idea to remove the catalytic converter to avoid
burning it up. I understand that it builds up tremendous heat from extended
runs. I beleive it was Jim Pasha (of Excellence) who wrote that replacing
it with a hollowed out used one would help aleviate this.  How easy is this
to do on a regular basis as my car is street driven as well. Is it simply
undoing the bolts/nuts on the exhaust tube and removing a section? Should I
have flanges welded into section?  Is it necessary for runs which are
probably only 30 minutes long (at tracks like laguna seca and willow
springs). TIA
