Before picking up the phone and calling a mail order parts place, be sure
to check the dealer.  PCNA has finally seen the light and realized they
were losing a sizeable and profitable parts business to aftermarket
suppliers.  They wisened up and lowered many prices.  This started with
the PPE (Porsche Parts Express program) which was a limited list of
reduced priced parts.  They subsequently dropped the program and
restructured the pricing across the board.  It is a relief to see the
price gouging diminish to some extent. 

Recent purchases I made:

Factory hood badge  - Dealer $27  Automotion $37  Performance $35
Porsche oil filter  - Dealer $5   Automotion $9   Imparts $7 Performance $11
Porsche fuel filter - Dealer $15  Automotion $24  Imparts $21 Performance $27
Porsche floor mats  - Dealer $110 Automotion $125 Performance $125
Porsche lighted key head (key blade not included)
                    - Dealer $13, Automotion $23(!) Performance (with 
                      blade) $30(!)

Mail order prices don't include shipping charges.

Genuine Porsche parts for less than aftermarket, and no shipping charge, 
should you be within driving distance of a Porsche dealer.  I was 
pleasantly suprised.

Some notes.. these dealer prices reflect a 15% PCA discount (folks should 
really join, the $35 investment is well worth it).  Even without the 
discount the prices are still in line.

Mail order houses will most likely follow PCNA's lead and reduce some 
prices to remain competitive, but in the meantime, be sure to call around.

I am not affiliated with PCNA or any parts suppliers, so I have no 
interest except in getting genuine parts at good prices.
