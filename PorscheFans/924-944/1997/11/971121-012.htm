 1.  I don't believe there were any seat options other than the amount of
powered adjustments - all were "sport seats".

2.  This question has been brought up before, but I don't think anyone has
come up with any definitive parts outlet or list.  There used to be a fixed
headlight 944 in my PCA region, but the owners haven't been active in any
events for several years, so I don't even know if they still have the
vehicle.  I'll see if I can get in touch with them for additional
information and post the results to the list.  (BTW, I think they also had
one of the infamous "Saratoga Tops")
