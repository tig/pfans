In a message dated 97-11-21 16:14:52 EST, you write:

<< My question is, are the noise <<" turbo whine up to 0.2 bar boost" <<and
low idle connected, and if so, is 
 there something they could have screwed up by doing the belt job?  Or 
 does this sound like belt noise, and am I worrying for nothing?  
 Except for the lower idle,(which isn't always that low) the car seems 
 to run as perfectly as when I took it in.      >>

I think you're just hearing the turbo spool up and pump air.  Sometimes you
don't notice a noise for a long time.  Then when you finally notice it, you
can't "not" notice it, so it seems like it just appeared.  I'm lucky, my
mechanic is one of my best friends now.  He would almost pay me to have him
testdrive my 951.  You should have your mechanic test drive your car with you
so he can hear any noises, but It sounds to me like you're ok if the car's
running great.  The idle doesn't sound like a problem.  Sounds like it's set
a little low.  The idle adjuster screw is ontop of the intake manifold.  When
the car's at operating temp, bump your idle up a hair and see if that doesn't
clear it up.
