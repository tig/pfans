 Hi all, I read so much about the Electric problems with earlier 924's (mine
is 78) which apparently got fixed later on.
When I measure the voltage it reads 12V on the dot since I had it (3 years
ago) eventhough I replaced the voltage regulator a couple of years ago.
Nothing seems to increase the voltage which seems independent of the
Alternator belt tension. I even ran another cable from the battery negative
terminal to the alternator housing and to the body itself but nothing seems
to increase the voltage.
In my wife's car (87 olds cuttllas) it always reads at least 14.5 volts .!
I like to know if this is an inherent problem and how was it solved?
The main problem I have is with the headlights, they are barely bright
enough for me to see the road! and of course you know winter is here which
means heater, wipers and the whole nine yards is surely going to influence
my ability to drive it at night (eventhough I am not a night cruiser).
I just rememberd that I even replaced "One Head Light" ( sounds familiar)
but it was no better than the original.
Thanks for your help in advance.
