It appears Jim discovered the source of his noise in a post this evening 
(Sat) but I have a comment about balance belt whine.  After 2000 miles 
mine never quieted down, even after the retension to spec, so I went in 
and loosened it a slight bit outside of spec (horrors!)  The noise did 
not go away completely, but I reduced it quite a bit.  I've been driving 
it this way for several weeks, and with some spirited redline runs, have 
suffered no ill effects.  I observed the belt running with the cover off 
to ensure it was not rubbing or interfering with anything as I revved the 
engine.

One final note to beat this dead horse.. the belt is marked with a paint
mark.  The factory manual notes that this mark should be on the outside of
the belt.  My shop installed it on the inside.  I queried them about this,
asking if the tooth profiles are perhaps different on each side of the
belt, causing noise from an improper fit on the teeth, but they said no..
it is a reference mark only and the belt can be installed either way.  It 
would be interesting to experiment.
