One of the connectors for the rear defroster on my 85.5 944 has come off
of the glass (where it attaches to the 'elements'). How can I connect
back to glass/element? (solder?)


I have met this too. The spooky thing is all my Porsche woes happen to other 
people too. 
I superglued the connector back on which worked and then I tried some 
aluminium paint to complete the circuit. THIS DID NOT WORK..
I resorted to a 25 W soldering iron and, having cleaned the metal areas first 
applied a small amount of solder around the area of the connector. It's 
difficult to keep it as neat as I wanted with the tailgate open but it looks 
ok. More importantly it works and has been working for the last six weeks. A 
slightly hotter iron might be easier but I suspect there is a risk of the 
glass getting too hot in one area and possibly cracking.

Good luck

Alyn, with a clear rear view
