Talk to Jim Moder (moderj@email.kaiserslautern.army.mil) who ROUTINELY
runs his 951S at top speed (150+) on the Autobahn.

Don't you guys ever drive on the track? 

At Pocono I was hitting 140+ (with the windows down) and was still
accellerating before I had to turn left. After a little while you
don't even notice the speed when traveling in a straight line. Yeah,
the scenery does move pretty quickly, but you concentrate on your
landmarks, and don't pay attention to the speed. Now, trying to turn 
at that speed, especially when there's a BIG wall on the right,
that's a different story!
