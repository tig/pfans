I was accelerating moderately hard in 2nd gear and was upshifting to 3rd 
when the engine silently lost a lot of power.  It felt as though the car 
was running on 1 or 2 cylinders.  The exhaust note changed and has
gotten 
a little louder.  The car sounds like an old British sports car now with 
a distinct 'braapp' note when the gas pedal is pressed.  The idle speed 
wavers around 300-500 rpm and the acceleration is flat with no stumbling
or bucking.

Doug,

Sounds to me like the exhaust might be playing games. The exhaust
manifold ahs a tyendency to crack where the pipes from the 1st and 4th
cylinders meet, but I'm sure that if that happened the problem would be
simply poor running, not as bad as you have indicated. 

Check the whole exhaust system. There could be a leak caused by some
broken bolts.

Cause? If this is the case, maybe your catalytic converter is plugged
up, causing excess back pressure.

Just a guess....
