Im sorry, but I just had to get in on the discussion of porsche's as dail=
y
drivers
There is no other car I would rather drive than a porsche, but as a daily=
 =

driver (to me) it just doesnt work. Now, I maybe unlucky but in the past
6mos.
my '86 951 has had timing belt, waterpump,etc...(bent valves), all new
brakes
The infamous leaking header, new exhaust(not yet done).
And, Ive still got to replace the clutch, motor mounts, and a suspension
part which I havent even looked into yet. =

        The header is being re-rewelded tonight after the 1st attempt
was a failure.  I cant wait to get the car back next week,(hopefully)
        Now, granted the car sat for over a year in 94-95 before I decide=
d
to spend some money to get it running properly. The car was driven by my
father since it was new and we were in between shops at the time
and forgot to replace the timing belt. But when it comes down to it, the
 $5000-6000.00 so far seem worth it, I love the car more than anything
but Im glad Ive had another car to drive while it has been in the shop.
just my .02.
        The car really does run great now, but I just need to get all the=

quirks figured out :)
Question::: About the Autothority stage2 chips: Is there any modification=
s
required?
                Thanks,
