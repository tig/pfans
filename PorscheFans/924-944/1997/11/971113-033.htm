I have an 85.5 944 and when I was at the dealer a couple of weeks ago
buying the seals, the service looked at my oil cooler and told me it was
the updated one and I wouldn't need the alignment tool.  I haven't been in
there yet so I'm not sure where/when you'd have to use.  Just thought I'd
pass that info along.
