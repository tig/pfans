     My worst nightmare came true last night.  I was stopped at a light,
when it turned green, I started to go and for some reason (still unknown) an
86 year old man drove out of a gas station and right into the front
passenger's side of my previously near perfect 1983 944 (only 70k).  He was
turning left into me so it was sort of head on.  Well, I can praise the way
our cars are built.  I was going about 25-30 and he 10-20.  My right fender
is pushed in a bit, the headlight destroyed and the bumper and Header panel
pushed in.  That's it.  His car, a 1993 4 dr Escort wagon looked as though it
hit a tank and had to be towed away.  He left in an ambulance and got written
up for failure to yield the right of way.  I'm a little stiff but my baby
drove home fine.  
     Here's my problem.  On the way home, two new things began to happen.
 One, I noticed what sounded like a helicopter following me and two, I kept
hearing high pitched popping sounds romhatch.  When I got home, under the
garage lights I could see what looks like a big problem with the rear glass
hatch.  All along the very top, there are what look like little raised rivets
or bumps of some kind on the top surface of the glass spaced about 3-4 inches
apart.  These are only along the top of the glass.  And, that black edging
all around the perimeter of the glass is now silver/white just above where
the two top hinges are.  When I raised the car on the jacks, my rear wheels
have a hell of a lot of play.  The bearings are SHOT!!!
     Here are my questions: 1.  Have those "raised rivets" on the glass hatch
been there all along and I somehow never noticed them?   2.  I know the black
edging above the hinges was black and is now silver/white.  Can this really
be from the accident?  I anticipate a fight with the other guy's carrier.  3.
 How could my rear bearings be shot from the accident?  They were fine.  I
checked all four wheels for play only 2 weeks ago myself.  Now both rears are
shot.
     I would greatly appreciate any help you guys can give.  I don't have
collision coverage so I know this isn't going to be an easy job with his
carrier.  Feel free to e-mail me directly at RBrooks268@aol.com since I'm not
too sure how much anyone else cares for these answers.
     Thanks in advance.
