As you clean up all the vacuum leaks you will see the car run cleaner,
cooler, and faster.

Keep up the good work.

	Just a couple more notes on this. Since replacing the oil cap
o-ring the
	engine runs cooler. Before it was running just above the first
hash mark
	(highway driving). After replacing it runs just above the
"square" on the
	left of the gauge. I can think of no other reason for running
cooler. Its
	not the outside temp because today its in the 60s and is running
cooler
	than it was last week when temp was in the 40s.

	Also just because your oil cap o-ring is there doesn't mean its
doing its
	job. If its never been replaced it might make a difference to do
so.
