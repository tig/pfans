Rudy,
  Thanks a million for your input. The car usually starts fine when cold. 
Most of my problem has been when it is hot. It happened again today. It sat 
for 30 minutes after being driven normally, and barely idled when restarted. 
Any attempt to give it gas to bring the idle up would cause it to stall. 
after idling for about 2 minutes at 200-300 RPM, It finally came back up to 
1000 RPM, and I could give it gas again. "???!!!" This is very frustrating.. 
The last time I saw something like this was on a 77' 280Z I had as a 
teenager. That was vaperlock. This is so wierd because it is fine out on the 
road. There has only been one instance it stalled at a stop light. That was 
within 5 minutes after being restarted hot. I think I might go ahead and 
pull the idle stabilizer anyway to see if helps to clean it up. Any hints on 
taking it apart or what to clean it with? I am pretty handy with cars, but I 
don't want to spray it with the wrong chemical and wreck it. 
  I will also take a look at the DME relay. Can't hurt. Is it in the fuse 
box? Thanks again for your time.

   Todd

Yes, it is.

No, there is not.

If your car does not start when cold. But it does start with a little
gas, I mean let your right fot be the idle stabilizer.

I have mine cleaned up. I think it's a genuine Bosch part, but I don't
know the number.

If I put your story together: have you checked your DME-relay? If the
relay has bad contacts, the car stalls at very unpredictable times.
Mostly you can start your car immediately, but one time it took me 30
minutes.
Just a thought.

Regards, Rudy 'Broken Leg' Koskamp.
