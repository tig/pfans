  Hello again fellow 944 drivers!
    I wrote last week about a problem with my 87' 944 NA and bad HOT starts. 
Well, last night after work, I spent 45 minutes trying to start my car COLD!!
 This time, the motor just spun. No hints of anything catching or firing. 
There was gas, there was spark, there was air....but apparently not in the 
right order. Then, it "just started" and drove fine all the way home (45 min.
 drive). 
  I have seen talk of rebuilding the "idle stabilizer control" mentioned. I 
think I want to try going there. Someone said it is located under the intake 
manifiold. Some questions:
   1) Is it the round, gold colored can with an electrical connector and 
large hoses coming out of it?
   2) Is there any way to get it out without removing the intake?
   3) How can you tell if it is shot?
   4) Is PORSCHE Parts the ONLY place to get a replacement?
  Any help would be appresheated!! 

PS- Someone mentioned the fuel pressure regulator (single) on the fuel rail 
near the fire wall as a possible target for my problem. I see two such 
devices on the fuel rail. One in front, one in back. Removing the vaccum 
hoses when the car is idling does'nt seem to change anything. There is 
vaccum present on the little hoses, but I don't know what to think about 
their operational condition. Any ideas?? 

   Thanks,
     Todd Kent
