Dear P Fans

I'm a newbie to the list and to 944 ownership. Got a great deal on a
mechanically sound112K 85.5 944 to auto-x in SCCA, so what I do to it has to
work within their stock rules, which are pretty restrictive. Many of the
changes allowed to PCA stock are not allowed for SCCA. 

Questions:

1. I have sent off to PCNA for the original build list on the car, but where
can I locate a list of the options available for 85.5 and what that all
entails? For instance, what changes did the sport suspension package include
over the standard? Were 16" wheels with the 8" rear and 7" front widths part
of that package or separate or even available with the sport suspension? Any
suggestions who I should call if no "listers" have any? Is my understanding
there was the regular and sport suspension available only- easiest way to
differentiate is the std. had no rear swaybar, sport did and that Koni
yellows were an option within that option? The FAQ list shows the option
groups, but not the individual items therein.

2. Anyone have a set of these wheels available at a fair price (like half the
price of new ones?). Looks are inconsequential as long as they're straight. A
set of R tires already mounted would make for bonus bucks.

3. Anyone experienced with the front control arm/ball joint rebuilders- who's
good and who's bad?

4. Anyone know where to get poly/delrin or other hard bushings for the stock
front swaybar? I hate to spend $300+ for a Weltmeister sway bar just because
I can't get the harder bushings. I'm not sure if their fancy drop links are
legal in C Stock- anyone out there have first hand knowledge or know if you
can use the stock drop links if not?

5. I'm planning on replacing the front coil springs with factory new, but
wonder about the torsion bars in back. Since I have zero experience with
t-bars, would it improve handing any to change these (but have to remain P
original)?

6. Anyone have a low mileage, good condition catalyst cheap or know where to
get one without spending a fortune? At the mileage this thing has, I betcha
the one on it is original and if not partially collapsed already, will soon
be. No sense doing a cat back exhaust if the converter is plugged up.

7. Opinions on what brake pads to use? Auto-x and Porsche events will be
about it- the car will only be driven occasionally on the street (most of
that to events- 160 miles away).

8. Any suggestions on who to balance/blueprint fuel injectors? I have one
that's leaking anyhow (producing occasional dieseling- a new one for me in an
F.I. car) so thought I'd get them all checked/worked on anyhow.

8. And lastly. Anyone tried Kumho R compound tires and have an opinion vs.
BFG?

Kudos to the list meister.
