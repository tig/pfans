Hey, gang, back for advice/info on some electrical problems in my '77
924. The first is the auxiliary air regulator. I've determined that this is
_not_ getting any voltage whatsoever, and doesn't even seem to have a
ground. My understanding is that whenever the ignition is on, this should
have 12V across the terminals at all times. Am I missing something here?
Is there a connector that could be unplugged somewhere in there? Help?

The other thing is my rear defrost: the relay keeps fusing the contacts
together whenever I switch it on. I then have to unplug the relay, open it
up, break the weld on the contacts, and retry. It is acting like there's a
short to ground, but I'm still getting +12V back at the hatch (on left side,
right side is properly grounded), and with the defroster grid unplugged,
and the relay shorted out, I have no problems. Does anyone know what
the correct resistance of the rear window defroster grid should be?

TIA...
.
