  With four new Bridgestone RE-71s, we
>(my SO and I) were set, and the drive was great.

Okay, you've told us part of the tale....
As Paul Harvey would say  "And now, the rest of the story"
How did you like the RE-71's?

*****

OK, firstly my apologies if this is more like a trip log rather an opinion
on the tires.   The RE-71s replaced a set of AVSi's which had been on the
car since 1991.  The two rear tires had to be replaced, but the fronts were
fine and had at least another 10-15k on them.  However, for the price of
two rear AVSi's (225-50ZR-16), including mounting, balancing, etc., I was
practically in the ballpark for a complete set of RE-71s, so I went that
route instead, although I would not hesitate to recommend the Yokohamas to
anyone--they're a great all-around tire.  The RE-71s now have about 2000
miles on them.

Since the RE-71s were new at the time, I was going to try and take it
relatively easy for most of the trip.  If anyone has not driven on
California's highway 1 from Monterey to Los Angeles, it is a good mix of
road, I guess: outstanding in places and only barely adequate in others.
For the most part, it is a windy two-lane (one each direction) road
overlooking precarious rocky drops and traversing glorious coastal
greenery.  It IS hard to keep your eyes on the road at times, and what's
tricky is that there are no passing lanes per se, but every so often there
is a dirt turnoff for motor homes and RV's (do they turn off?  No.  Any
when they do they raise an immense cloud of dust).  You have to watch the
center line markings and judge for yourself.  I saw what looked like
several really close calls in terms of passing.  Why is everyone in such a
hurry?!

The problem with highway 1 now is there is a lot of major road construction
projects going on in several different places.  I'm sure a lot of this is
to prepare for the rainy season, but what happens is you can get to the
point where the road is wide open and there is no one in front and no one
in back, then suddenly come to a flag station where they've just closed the
road in one direction for anywhere from five to twenty minutes, and
everyone piles back up again.  Kind of frustrating, but this only happened
about three times.

OK, on to the tires.  Since it's been six years since I've had new tires on
the car, it took some getting used to.  Overall roadworthiness was
impressive.  I think the dry performance is equal if not superior to the
AVS, but I can't yet comment on wet characteristics.   The RE-71s represent
a good, solid value since the price seems to be coming down.  I'm happy
with them so far, and they're solely for street use at present, i.e., no
track or auto-x time (not yet, anyway).  Past San Simeon, midway down the
coast, the road opened up to reveal wide, smooth-as-glass sweepers, and one
could get the car well past 100mph without even trying.

Of course, by the time we got to San Luis Obispo, the brake pad light had
come on, but that's another story.  I should say that highway 1 is not my
preferred means of travel to LA.  I had never driven it before past Carmel,
so of course I was curious.  On the return trip, we opted for the much
quicker but boring highway 5.

Sorry for this rambling, and thanks for reading.  I suspect that when the
tires start to slowly wear in I'll have a lot more good things to say about
them.
