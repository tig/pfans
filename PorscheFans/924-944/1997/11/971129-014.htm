Hi Porsche Fans,
I completed today the clock bulb change as decribed below. I have added =
my
comments in the text:

Replacement of the digital clock on a 1987 944S ***1986 944***

1.  Open passenger side door and remove the triangular piece of trim tha=
t
is
on the side of the dash (one screw).
2. Remove the screw(s) for the passenger air vent which are now exposed.=
 I
removed all three which may have been too many. The "slider" for the ven=
t
control can be pushed through the vent which should eliminate the need t=
o
actually remove the whole vent.
3. There is a plate to the left of the passenger vent which, when pried
off,
reveals two screws (remove).
4. Now the secret known only to a few German engineers (and everyone who=

e-mailed me) - with your fingernails or a coin, turn the circular climat=
e
control sensor cover counterclockwise (an eighth of a turn or so) and
remove
which reveals another screw (remove).
5. Remove all knobs for the climate control system (fan -temperature - a=
nd
the two sliders). *** The sliders come off easy, but temperature knob an=
d
especially
fan knob were very tight. You have only to be brave and use some force t=
o
pull the knobs off. *** Unscrew the nut on the temperature control knob.=

Unscrew
all four screws in order to loosen the climate control assembly (need no=
t
be
removed). *** I spent some time wondering 'what four screws?!?', but you=
'll
first have to remove the black plastic dash plate which covers the clima=
te
control gadgets. Then you'll see the four screws. CAUTION! Be very caref=
ul
when
bending, removing and installing the plastic dash plates (especially thi=
s
one;
I broke it when ripping it off. Well, nothing that glue won't fix...). T=
he
plastic
changes its mechanical properties and becomes very fragile over the year=
s.
***
The two screws on the right hand side also hold the trim piece for the
clock.
6. The trim is now loose from the dash. I found it a little difficult to=

get
to the clock until I popped the hazard flasher switch out of the trim.  =
The
clock is held to the trim by two very small Phillips head screws and two=

tabs
that fit into slots in the trim. The screws must be removed. *** No need=
 to
remove these screws when changing only the light bulb. The bulb comes of=
f
easily.
The bulb is located in a simple hole behind the clock without fastening.=

The bulb, which sits in a slot attached to the wire, can be pulled off i=
ts
slot. ***
There is a plug for the clock that comes off easily.
7. Replace your clock. *** I didn't have an 'official' spare bulb, and t=
he
car parts
stores were already closed, so I went to the general store and bought 12=

Volts small
Cristmas tree light set spare bulbs (all colours, cost $1). After a smal=
l
file work
the cristmas tree light bulb (I chose orange) fitted almost perfectly to=

the clock
light bulb slot. Note the locations of the terminal wires of the bulb if=

using this
kind of arrangement. *** Pop the hazard switch back into its slot. Prepa=
re
to
do battle with the air temperature sensor which connects into a small bl=
ack
hose that is probably now hiding inside the dash. Find this hose before =
you
reattach the clock plug and the four way flasher switch. Position the ho=
se
in
the hole and push the trim piece in so that the sensor tube goes into th=
e
hose (this is the way I did it - like the light in the fridge, I assume =
its
working when I close the door). Took me 45 minutes. *** Took me 4 hours,=

including
the trip to town to buy the Xmas decoration ;-) ***

I hope you'll find these 'updated' instructions useful.
