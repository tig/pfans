Last year I purchased a set of aluminum shims with adhesive backing at TRAK
Auto.  They lasted about three weeks in my DeLorean.  Since then I have just
listened to them squeal.  Don't bother trying them.

I installed the Automation anti-squeal shims behind my 951 brake pads about
three months ago.  They are plastic sheets (polyethylene I think) with an
adhesive backing.

Last week the brakes started to squeal.  I discovered that the front shims
had worn through where the pistons rubbed.  The plastic was extremely brittle
and readily broke apart.  Plastics loose the plasticizers, with heat and/or
time, and crack -- like dashboards.  The rear shims had a few cracks but were
mostly whole and still working.

These shims have endured daily commutes to and from work, two driving schools
and two time trials.  Without the extreme heat generated at the track, the
shims might have lasted for quite some time.

This weekend I purchased Permatex Ultra Disc Brake Caliper Lube.  A synthetic
lubricant that "prevents disc brake squealing".  It was recommended by the
foreign auto parts store that I frequent.  It states "apply Caliper Lube to
pins, slides, bushings, pistons and rubber sleeves and seals.  The 951 has
fixed calipers so I applied it to the back of the pads where the pistons
touch.  Unfortunately, I had a wheel problem this week that has garaged the
car so I have been unable to test the high temp grease.  I'll report in a few
weeks.

Good luck, Claus Groth, '86 951
