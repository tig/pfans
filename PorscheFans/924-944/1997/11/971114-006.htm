You are lucky, I was just reading about this last night.

According to the "Good Book", you need a thin Phillips screwdriver to 
undo the screws that sit between the front lip of the hood and the panel 
that the hood crest is mounted on.  After all of those screws are 
removed, you must slide the panel with the hood crest forward.  The only 
fasteners holding the panel on are those that boarder the front of the 
hood.

Now I can't say how to best slide that panel forward, but I would 
consider a pry bar with a good insulator between it and the sheet metal, 
of course.

Once off, the release mechanism should be accessible once the panel is 
off.

Good luck!
