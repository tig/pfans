It is really neat to play the high road, after all can someone who does
not have you level of the language have any merit.

Your action of directing many people to e-mail someone is like posting
some one number in a bar's bathroom as available for free sex, nothing
more.

As for Bob, I misspoke and you knew who we were talking about.

Your actions and apparent disregard for other show your level of honor.

	'compassion' n. a feeling of pity that makes one want to help or
show mercy. (Oxford) 
	Sure, I have a feeling of pity for a turd brain like yourself
that cannot see the humour in a situation that has happened several
times in the past on the list due to no fault of the original poster. I,
however, do not see how you can interpret my posting to poor Bill as
anything except making fun of a hilarious situation. Obviously, some of
the subscribers to the Porsche list is sufficiently anal retentive that
every tongue in cheek posting must be accompanied by the usual infantile
smiley.

	Pardon me sir, but your command of the English language leaves a
lot to be desired. If, however, this is a carefully disguised attempt at
humour, accept my humble apology. If it is meant as a form of oxymoron,
it is both unwarranted, foolish AND TRASH. 
		        I think you owe Bob and apology.
	Who is Bob, and who is the unnamed person that I owe an apology
to?
