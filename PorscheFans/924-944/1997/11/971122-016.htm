Just a couple more notes on this. Since replacing the oil cap o-ring the
engine runs cooler. Before it was running just above the first hash mark
(highway driving). After replacing it runs just above the "square" on the
left of the gauge. I can think of no other reason for running cooler. Its
not the outside temp because today its in the 60s and is running cooler
than it was last week when temp was in the 40s.

Also just because your oil cap o-ring is there doesn't mean its doing its
job. If its never been replaced it might make a difference to do so.
