Arrr!  Leave a bra on throughout the winter?  Really, with all the dirt?  
Try this; put on a tight bra (use minimum cup size for best effect) and 
pour some sand, dirt, and sharp cinders in there.  Now jump up and down 
and maybe do a few cheers for good measure too.

What you now feel is your paint being scraped off.  Trapped moisture will 
also fog your paint.  Only put a clean bra on a clean car and allow the 
paint to breath by going braless on a regular basis.
