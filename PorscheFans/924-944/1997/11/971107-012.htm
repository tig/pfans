Bill responds:

Well 185mph on my motorcycle can get a little scary sometimes. 
Especially if the guy in front of me decides it's time to slow down
before I do.  Ever draft someone at 185 on two wheels?  Now THAT is a
rush.  On another note, 200mph without a vehicle can be a little scary
too (head down dive from 13,500 feet) but only because my altimeter is
on my wrist, behind my back and you always wonder if you've held that
dive just a bit to long...been there done that and THAT gentlemen is
scary.  The ground doesn't seem to get any closer to you until you're
under 2000 feet (ground rush) and at 2000 you're about 8 seconds from
being the guy on the news.  I've been as low as 1300 when I opened and
the people on the ground could make out the expression on my face. 
Sorry, back to Porsches.

Bill
