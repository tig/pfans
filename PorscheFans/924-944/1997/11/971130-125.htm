Frank,

Thank you for your post.  I have not had a chance to look at a number of 
belt tensioners and what their preload tension was.  However, since I 
verified that my Turbo tensioner was about 1.8 after it was secured and 
the gauge properly attached, I would be suspicious about relying on the 
tensioner to get it in the ball park.  It may be true that my particular 
tensioner value is on the outside edge of the spectrum, but it also 
serves as a warning that this is an expectable result.

As a side note, I do recommend the updated water pump modification that 
has the steel guide plate that prevents the timing belt from contacting 
itself.  This was what happened to my Turbo.  I had a slapping sound when 
the car was revved up.  Had I not had the updated pump, the cogs on the 
belt would have rubbed against each other and possibly destroyed the 
belt, and so, too, the valves.

Having two cars to maintain, and one being a 16 valve engine, I could 
easily justify my purchase of the tools.  I feel better that I have them 
and since I plan on keeping these cars for a long time (at least until 
used Boxsters are affordable!), it is a worthy investment.

Marv
