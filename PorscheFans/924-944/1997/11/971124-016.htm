About 3 months ago, I went on a little road trip around Arizona, up into
Sedona, on up th Flagstaff, then back home to Phoenix. The weather was nice
on the way up, but when we were in Sedona (admiring the beautiful
landscape), the sky turned nasty. Our hiking about was no longer an option,
so we decided to trip op to Flagstaff. After eating and browsing around, it
started to rain pretty heavily, so we jumped in "Little Red" and headed
south.

I was running on Pirelli P6's on the rear, and the tread "wasn't bad" in
appearance. I planned on replacing them within a month or so. I had already
put Yokos on the front.

The freeway was only damp in spite of some heavy rain, and we were making
some decent time ;-)... All of a sudden, we hit a severe downpour. I lifted
my foot off the accelerator to slow from my 80 mph rate of travel.

This is the fun part ---

With little standing water, and the back end SLIGHTLY lifting, the rear
tires gave way. The front tracked perfectly, as is to be expected, but the
rear tires were shy enough tread that they couldn't stick. I fishtailed to
the left, straightened, right, straightened again, and lost all and spun
180, full slide, then back around. I was fortunate. I came to a rest just
off the freeway, next to a tree. After I stopped shaking as bad, I checked
out my car (in the pouring rain - I am a Porsche fanatic!) No physical
damage, though I did lose my sway bar bushings on one side (odd). To this
day, no other negative signs from that incident.

Morale (there IS a point to this...) - Your tires make the difference. I've 
experienced similar conditions on my new Yokos with no problems. I'm keeping 
very close tabs on my tread...
