Hello Jon,

Hooray! Something other than 'I know about boost, and you don't', or
'Airbags kill! No, People kill'!

Some questions for you:
How prepared are you to modify the car? One nice thing about the
89 951, is that it comes with the sport suspension and many other
nice things. Now the suspension isn't so important if you are
going to modify it (like almost everyone does). However, the
89 951 comes with the Limited Slip Trans, and larger front rotors.
If you can find a 968 with the M030 package, then it has the
same goodies.

Assuming the two cars are set up the same, then much of it has
to do with the rules, and how they chance. In 97, the 89 951
was in the same class as the 95 993 based 911. IMHO, the 951
has no chance against that car. On the east coast, 993's won
class E at Lime Rock, Summit Point, Pocono, and I think almost
everywhere else. I've heard that the 95 993 is going to move to 
class D for 98, but that is not official.

In any case, a 968 will be in class F, where it will be very
competitive. Assuming you get the weight down to the min, 3086 lbs,
and do the suspension right, you'll run at the front. 

It's probably easier to get motor parts for the 944, but the
rest of the running gear is real close. 

My choice, if someone were going to give me the car, would be
the 968. It's got a normally asiperated motor, so no turbo lag, 
and a 6 speed tranny, so better gear ratios. 

Let the debate begin!
