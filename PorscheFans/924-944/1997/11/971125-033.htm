Hello all,

I've removed the engine from my car.  Last night I pulled the head.  The
cylinder walls are severely scored with many vertical scores.  I have
not removed the bottom end yet so I don't exactly know what the pistons
are like.

Both piston tops and cylinder head (bottom?) are covered with the
charred remains of oil.  The oil was coked up and formed hard soot
particles.  I'm guessing the presence of oil in the combustion chamber
eventually lead to the scored cylinder walls.  Leading to pressurized
crankcase, followed by bearing failure.

Luckily I haven't found any metal particles anywhere except on the oil
drain plug magnet.

What are the chances that the pistons are re-usable?  They are mahle 2.8
liter pistons from andial.  I'm not that interested in buy a new set of
mahle pistons for a bored block.

If the pistons are re-usable I'd like to find either a new block or a
used one in decent shape.  What are the chances of this happening? (i.e.
fitting the pistons to a different block)

If the pistons are not reusuable I'm probably going to go with JE
pistons and a sleeved block.  Or return the car's engine to stock form
(providing I find a decent used engine for parts).

Thanks for any info.

As for speculating where the oil came from.  The K-27S turbo was blowing
oil into the intake.  This is usually a result of other problems, i.e.
too much crankcase pressure.  Either the 2.8l engine had an inherent
pressure problem, or the turbo was being fed too much oil from the
balance shaft.  Another possibility is that the valve stem seals were
leaking too much oil into the chamber.  The oil coked up, rubbed the
cylinders bare, and caused the pressure problems, causing the turbo to
leak.
