Subject: 	Sunroof Gear

First time Porsche owner (86-944) have been following listings and
getting a
great education. Was hoping someone could point me in the right
direction
regarding a sun roof problem. I have traced the cause to a broken shaft
on
the small gear that sticks out of the motor and drives the cable to the
roof.
Tried Porsche they have the gear but not the shaft. They suggested I buy
the
motor for $650.
 Every parts store I talk to wants to sell me a plastic gear. I have one
and
it's not the correct part. Any suggestions would be appreciated

Hi Pxhil (!)
It is important to know that the sunroof system was totally revised in
the mid to late 86 model year. The two systems have no interchangable
parts. Most folks seem to assume that if you have an 86 you have the
earlier style. The plastic gear that store want to sell you is the gear
that is contained in the sunroof gearbox located in the roof - a common
failure. I think you need a new motor! or better yet a good used motor.
If you have the later style I have a motor the I got to fix mine.(this
is how I found out about the 86 model revision!)
If you have any questions about the earlier type I have become quite
familiar with the system.
