My car had the same drip, with the requisite smoke and smell.  A good
friend of mine who collects Ferraris and used to own a shop suggested
switching to Kendall oil.  Apparently it drips less or something.
Common sense told me that this was BS, but I tried Kendall at my next
change and the smoke & smell have disappeared.  It still drips (much
less) but Kendall doesn't seem to smell or smoke when it hits the
manifold.  I never would have believed it, but I switched brands at
51,000 and now I'm at 117,000 with no problems.
