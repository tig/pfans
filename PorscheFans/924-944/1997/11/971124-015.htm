Hi everybody,

I just wanted to shed light on how well these cars can handle
sometimes.  I was
cruising down loop 360, here in austin, at night.  Two lanes going both
directions and
down below some clifs as they blew up the rock to make the highway.  I
was behind
a minivan and there were a bunch of cars in the right lane.  As i topped
the hill and
started banking around the curve the van slides all over the road for no
reason, well
then I saw this huge box about 6' tall looking right at me, i'm doing
about 75.  I hit
the brake, pulled the wheel and then let off the brake, the car just
slid to the right
about a food and a half.  Just enough to miss that damn thing.

PHEW

I just believe that there was no chance of the car acting up too much,
it acted very well,
Maybe if i were in another car, the same might have happened.  Don't
know.

I Love my car! <<sniffle>>
