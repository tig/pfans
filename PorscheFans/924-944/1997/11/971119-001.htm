Hi my summary - in the interests of clearing up confusion - correct me if
you know better plse......

1. Sekurit - a windshield company in Germany that makes OEM windshields for
Porsche
2. Sekuriflex - some windshields made by Sekurit with coating on INSIDE -
assumed purpose is to work effectively with air bags
3. All modern windscreens (Sekurit, Sekuriflex or after market) are
laminated - two sheets of glass separated by a plastic layer - these crack,
but do not shatter
4. Some US States force insurance companies to use OEM  (??)
5. Some US States do not force insurance companies to use OEM
6. Elsewhere in the world insurance companies typically cover an amount for
window glass- the owner can choose OEM if they wish, but have to pay the
difference.
7. Some countries have standards which ensure that any after market glass
is at least as safe as OEM - as long as fitted properly.

Bottom line (as usual) is that OEM is too damned expensive because of
monopoly, import duties, shipping costs etc.

Don't flame me if this is wrong (unless you want to - hey, I don't care) -
better still contribute to the clarification.......
