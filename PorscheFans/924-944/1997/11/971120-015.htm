Try visiting your local wholesale electrical distributor, or possibly a
hi-fi/stereo shop.  Luckily, I'm in the electrical business, so I
happen to have a few cans on hand.  Unfortunately, I don't have enough
to supply the Pfans, but sure wish I could.


Another possible source would be a computer store - Head and Disk
Cleaner might work, although the can I have states that it is safe on
all rubber and <underline>most</underline> plastics.  It says that it
will "quickly remove carbon deposits, ink, magnetic iron oxides, oil
films, dirt, lint, dust and other soils; will not harm rubber, most
plastic or elastomers; improves the frequency response of the unit and
extends tape life by reducing wear; cleans quickly and evaporates
instantly, eliminating down time; test in an inconspicuous area before
using on plastics".

CONTENTS:  Dichlorofluoroethane (CAS#1717-00-6), isopropyl alcohol
(CAS#67-63-0), carbon dioxide (CAS#124-38-9). NON-FLAMMABLE


I hate to say this, but at least I'm set okay and wish the rest of you
good luck.
