One option you might want to consider - there was a factory
option on the 944 for a 10 speaker stereo system.  Three in
each door, and two on each side in the rear.  The proper
mounting brackets, cutouts, etc are all available.  I've been
thinking about building a higher end system using these parts
so that everything looks as OEM as possible.  I've just started
investigating this, so don't even know what size the speaker
openings are.

That said, Boston Acoustics makes some nice 4x6 'plate' speakers
that fit in the existing cutouts.  These have a 4" mid-woofer and
a seperate tweeter.  Street price is a little over $100/pr.
BA also makes a less expensive 4x6 coaxial, but there is a bar
in the door running behind the speaker which makes the opening just
a bit too shallow to accept these.

I haven't gotten into my rear speakers yet.  But hope to one
of these weekends.  (It's only taken me 11 years to get around
to replacing the Blau...)

Thanks to altavista, I found some good info at:

I think he was a bit too quick to install an amp.  I would replace
the head unit in the 'mild' setup, rather than installing an amp.
(And have done so.)  Newer radios typically have 4 amplifiers
rather than 2, and each are 2-3x more powerful than the old
Monterey's amps.  Not to mention much better audio quality and
direct CD capabilities.
