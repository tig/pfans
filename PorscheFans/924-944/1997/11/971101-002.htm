Terry's Subject: brake update

Thank you everyone that replied to my post yesterday. I am happy to say when
I
took the car to an independant P-shop today they diagnosed the problem as
lack
of vacuum and the need for the system to be bled. The brakes are now better
than new and the total cost was $30.00.
BUT- It was brought to my attention that I am in need of new shocks all the
way around, if any one has a set of shocks in good condition that they can
sell for a fairly inexpensive price, please let me know. They do not need to
be high end shocks, I just need something that is going to work.

Thank you, 
Terry

Terry-

Email me at "jeffbcs@aol.com" and I can help you out with the desired shocks.
