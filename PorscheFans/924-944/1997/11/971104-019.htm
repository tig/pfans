It's probably either one of the balance shafts or the crank shaft.
Another problem I had is the oil pressure sender, but that's unusual.

Check for oil coming from the front of the engine. You proably need the
timing/balance belts and all seals taken care of. This is not an easy
job and usually runs about $700-800. It must be done every 60,000 mi. or
you will break the timing belt (especially if oil is on it) and ruin you
vavles, and it must be done by somebody experienced.
