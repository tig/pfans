This is just an opinion.
As there are many parts dealers that I havent used.

My #1 parts place is AutoAtlanta. They have knowledgeble salespeople who
know what they are selling. They specialize in 924-944 parts.
The customer service is excellent as they also have an free advice
service.
I also found them to be honest as the part that I needed turned out to
be a cheaper one that they offered to sell me instead of the more
expensive one that that I called about. How many places will do that?
As far as the shipping charge you should quote the shipping price and
add it to the total price of the parts. Many times it is cheaper to go
to your local dealer than it is to use a supplier that has to ship them.
