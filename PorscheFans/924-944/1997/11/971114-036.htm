Isn't this wrong? These cars had Audi engines, right? That's what the Auto
Atlanta catalog says, and that's what I have read everywhere else. A 375HP
turbocharged Audi engine.

Audi engines? Puh leeeeze...
 
No, the 2 liter engines all had iron blocks of Audi manufacture, the same
blocks I think used in some VW buses.  All 924 Turbos, including CGT's and
GT-R's, had heads from Porsche as far as I know.  The big differences I
think with the GTR were 1) the turbo was in the 944 location and 2) the
car used Kugelfischer mechanical injection.  I was lucky enough to see one
in a race shop, and the FI (at least I think it was Kugelfischer) was belt
driven.  Neato.
