Well, her I am again. I need of help. I have been having a minor ( a few
drops each time I stop the car) oil leak under my 87 944s. I put it up on
blocks today, cleaned the entire undercarriage, and located the source of the
leak. 
In an 87 944s, the air intake manifold attaches to the back of the boot that
ataches to the air flow meter, it snakes up to a hose that attaches to the
motor, and a hose that ataches to the oil fill tube just below the cap. At
the connection between the air intake manifold and the hose that goes to the
motor, there is a crack. The oil is leaking from here. 
My BIG question is, WHY IS THERE OIL HERE? Should this not be dry? Since
there is oil in here, isnt it safe to say along with the air that is being
blown into the engine, there is oil being blown into it?
I just had the oil changed last week. I checked the oil level today also, and
it appears to ba almost 2 quarts over where it should be. Is this the cause
of the oil overflowing into the air manifold?
Any help would be much appreciated. The dealer cost on the new manifold is
$55, not a major deal. The labor is quoted to be $240. I think I can do it
myself. But I want to know the cause of the oil being there before I do this.

Thank you, 
Terry
