I recently went on a 3 week trip in my 968 that took me from my home in =
Minnesota to Mid Ohio, Pocono International Raceway Boston, back to PIR, =
Pittsburgh and finally back home.  I have one of the new V1s with laser =
detection and the single thing that kept me from getting tickets (as I =
was typically cruising in the 85 - 115 mph range) was my CB radio and =
talking to the truckers.  If I had to give up either the radar detector =
or the CB for long drives, it would be the detector.  That's not to say =
the V1 didn't help, but in the case of "instant-on" and state troopers =
sitting on the back side of blind sweepers, the CB let me know what was =
up before the V1 did.  The V1 confirmed that the trooper had his gun on.

I plan to go I-40 across to California and then up towards Sacramento to
visit my son on the way home.  Hopefully, I'll avoid any major snow
problems using this route.  Since I'll be covering over 3000 miles and
would like to "make time" I'm curious what the consensus on radar
detectors is:

Do they provide enough warning in today's age of "instant on?"

If so, what's the favorite of those list members that use one?>>

Hi Tom,

Congratulations! I know your son will rest easier knowing you now have
your own playtoy. :-)

With instant on radar, detectors are only good at telling you about some
other poor fool who is getting clocked. If you are leading the pack and
there is clear space in front of you, chances are you are going to get
nailed.

I recommend setting the cruise control (yeah, I normally hate them too)
exactly 14 mph faster than the speed limit. My experience has been that
most cops will give you up to that point on the interstates.

If you are going to get a radar detector, get the Valentine One with
laser detection. When you decide you don't really need it, sell it to me
at a big discount. ;-)

The other game you can play on the interstates is to follow a half mile
or so behind a 'rabbit' or two. Just watch your rear mirror for
pursuers. If they are reacting to the guy in front, they may decide to
pull you over instead when they stumble onto you.

But that's for the boring interstates. I _really_ recommend you revise
your iterary and find out about what the car is really good at - high
speed cruising. Hwy 50 - the loneliest highway in America - is perfect
for crossing Nevada and the flats of Utah. And it is simply gorgeous
through the Sierra Nevadas past Lake Tahoe and down to Sacramento. Just
slow down when you approach the towns every 50 miles or so and you will
have no problemo with the local constabularies in Utah and Nevada. Hwy
50 in California is fairly heavily patrolled, particularly during ski
season...

I also recommend using hwy 95 - hwy 24 through southern Utah to get to
highway 50. It is also very isolated. I didn't see _one_ cop the entire
route, except for ranger-types next to the national parks. Speaking of
which, if you have some extra time, take hwy 12 down to Bryce Canyon
National Park. The road is incredible with extreme elevation changes
great curves, absolutely no traffic, and Bryce Canyon is absolutely
gorgeous. Capital Reef and Zion National Parks are also along this
route...

Just remember that Utah has open grazing with no fences. On my trip 3
years ago I encounted a herd of cows camped on the road just after a
rise followed later on by a herd of deer just after another rise...

BTW, Azure Blue seems like it will make a good stealth car. My first
Porsche was "Arrest Me Red", aka Indiscrot. I find Linen Metallic makes
them think I'm some sort of weird Lexus...
