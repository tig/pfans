Hi P-fans,

This weekend we had the last event of the season for Peachstae PCA. I
have been trying to get the transmission on my 85.5 944 ready, but I had
a call Wednesday morning telling me that my the reason my transmission
failed (in late summer) is that the differential broke. So I had to
continue using a borrowed transmission.

The limited slip has a welded collar that the ring gear bolts to. One of
the welds has broken, forcind the ring on to the pinion and damaging it.

Math:	ring and pinion	$800 (lower ratio = higher rpice)
	bearings and synchros $450
	labor	???

I have bought all of the other parts, so have no choice but to continue.
If anybody has a limited slip to sell let me know.

BTW - I can use a limted slip that is no good inside - all I need is the
outer casing. This is preferable because it's cheaper. Maybe George B.
has something?

TIA,

Tim Betteridge
