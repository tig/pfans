One point I haven't seen brought up yet - how was the car maintained?

I got my first 944 new back in '87, and drove it for 5 years and almost
50K miles.  I took good care up it and had very little ever go wrong.
The few problems I did have were fixed under warranty, or in the case
of a blower motor with a bad bearing, paid for by PCNA.

My latest 944 was purchased with 110K miles on it, and somewhat spotty
maintenance, but cheap.  I have more than made up for the savings in
purchase price with repairs.  Now the the drivetrain is up to snuff,
it is extremely reliable - I use the car as my daily driver during the
summer.

Bottom line - a well maintained 944 can be very reliable.  A poorly
maintained 944 can be a nightmare and a money pit!
