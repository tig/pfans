Well my porsche has been running for 2 whole days now without a problem so
far. I went and had the converter taken off the exhaust because I knew that
the element inside was busted. Man what difference in sound and performance.
That converter must have been blocking alot of airflow. I really like the
new sound it has and you can really tell a difference in airflow just by
standing behind it while it idles.
As soon as I can come up with the funds Im going to order a DME from  George
and try it out. He offered to help me out and I really appreciate it. I may
just go ahead and buy it and that will be one thing out of the way at least
and if the old one is not bad I will have one to keep as a backup.
What should the top end on a 866 94 be?
I have heard around town here that a guy raced his against someone.
I cant remember what he raced but the both topped put at about 120 and
neither one could pull the other. Does this sound right. I ran mine to 115
just to see and I still had another gear. I didnt want to push it because I
really want to go over the mechanics of the car really well to make sure
nothing falls off. Seeing as I had another gear to go I would think that I
can get more than 5 more miles per hour out of that last gear. Am I wrong?
