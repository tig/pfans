Dear PorscheFans,

I have a 1984 944.  When I first bought the car it had a fuel leak and I
found out the leak was caused by a rotted filler hole on the tank.  How
this happened I don't know, but anyway, I had it repaired using a used
tank I had found from a local used part supplier in the Chicago area. And
a repair shop replaced it for me.   Anyway, after I had it repaired, the
car sat for 6-8 months until I used it again.  At that time the tank I
just replaced was leaking again!  So I decided to fix it myself (my first
repair it yourself on any car and it was this job, outside of changing
oil etc).  So I went through the process of dropping the exhaust, trans
axle, etc to get the tank out and replaced all the hoses to fix the
problem, since I had the tank replaced recently. I get the car all put
back together put gas in it and viola, it was still leaking.  Imagine my
frustration, so back on the stands it went.  Pulled it apart again and
this time had the tank checked for leaks.  Sure enough there was a leak
in this tank, right on the top under the expansion chamber.  Then I had
the leak repaired and put the car back together.

So now I have fixed this problem twice and I am sure I have it fixed.  I
put gas in the car twice but not all the way as I am half afraid too. 
Well I get brave and fill the tank to the top and sure enough the blasted
thing is still %#$%^ leaking!

So after that brief history lesson so you can know my frustration, here
is my thoughts and I want your input.

1.)  I can have the tank relined by a shop in this area for about $300 or
so.
		OR
2.)  Buy another used tank GUARANTEED not to leak.

So here is my question, is there anyone out there that can tell me or
tell me who to ask about getting a used tank for less than getting my
current tank relined.  Or do you have any good advice.

I am getting frustrated, I love my 944, but can't stand the smell of gas
and I am ready to roll the thing off of a tall cliff (not really
<Smile>).

HELP!

Thanks

Jeff
