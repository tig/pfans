Hey Guys,

I need some help, and quick.  I have three problems that I would like to 
hear some responses for.  1)  My car won't start.  We've traced it to  
the fuel pump.  From there, we believe that no electricity is getting to 
the pump.  I checked the fuses, but none are burnt out.  What is the 
deal?  2)  It's been raining outside, and in fact, this is the first 
time I've encountered rain with my 944.  There is a lake of water behind 
the passenger seat.  The seals on the sun-roof and the door were not 
wet.  Where in the heck is the water coming from?  I really would like 
to know what is flooding my car.  and 3)  My tach is not working.  When 
I was test driving other Porsches, none of the tachs worked and my 944 
is not an exception.  Is there any way I can fix it with out dropping 
750 for a new one?  Thanks in advance.

--David--
