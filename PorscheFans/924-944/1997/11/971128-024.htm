Tom,

My sympathy for the bad experience with typical   auto sales sleazebags.  You 
are not  alone.  I once did some consulting for a director of MIS who had a 
similar experience buying a Pantera.  He and spouse made the deal and flew to 
Chicago from San Francisco expecting to drive it home.  It turned out to be a 
rust-bucket  and they had to fly back home without it.  He was quite incensed, 
and rightly so, like you.

Along the lines of an earlier post,  you can get all adds from the San 
Francisco Examiner and Chronicle which contain t "944"  e-mailed to you 
automatically every day.  Check out www.sfgate.com and go into the classified 
section and sign up for "e-mail alert".  I use it to keep track of current 
prices and availability for cars I'm interested in.  (If you use  "944" as a 
search string you will  get a few unwanted responses, mostly other car ads 
with 944 as part of their phone numbers.)

For those of you on the list who may be curious  about my 951 engine 
replacement project, I haven't been able to work on it or the last 2 months 
because of health problems.  I may decide to have my mechanic friend finish 
the project for me if he is willing to take it on.  Right now I have a wound 
on my foot which requires me to stay off it as much as possible and keeps me 
out of the garage.

I have the new clutch package (Turbo cup) form Jason at Paragon Products and a 
complete hose kit from  AJ-USA . Both the broken engine that came with the car 
and the replacement used engine are on stands in the garage.  The next step is 
to remove the head  on the replacement engine, inspect the combustion chambers 
and replace the head gasket.  After that, pull the pan and replace the rod 
earrings and crankshaft seals.  I've asked Tom Manning, formerly of L&S 
Machine (Lukes & Shorman) , now with Hasselgren Racing Engines, to machine the 
flywheel for me.  Have made no progress in the last 2 months, am getting 
anxious to make something happen.

Happy Holidays to all list members!
