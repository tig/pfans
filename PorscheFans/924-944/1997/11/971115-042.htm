If the car is to be used strictly for track, look for a 93 -95 968 with =
the M030 option and limited slip.  Trying to purchase these parts and =
install them after the fact is ridiculously expensive.  My 93 968 w/o =
the M030 package (limited slip, CD, 67k miles) cost me $22.5k.  You =
should be able to find a similar car with the M030 for around $25k - =
28k.  If your were to attempt to find all the parts for the M030 =
suspension, brakes and 17" wheels you would easily spend $5k - $8k.  The =
low number being if you could find some of the parts on the used market. =
 Good luck on that!  I've looked.

Joe is right.  In my limited experience, I believe my car can out handle =
most of the 911 types without breaking a sweat.  A great example of this =
is in the carrousel at Road America.  I can eat 911s in that corner with =
my stock suspensioned car.  I have also put on approx. 4 -5000 track =
miles on this summer and done nothing to the engine except have the =
belts tightened and/or changed on slightly more frequent intervals than =
the factory suggests.

The 968 w/M030 option is a better setup than the 944TS.  It has =
everything the turbo does plus.  And you probably won't be blowing head =
gaskets the way it seems the turbos ultimately do.  So check out the =
968.  The car many Porsche experts have said was the best of the 944 =
series.

Jon and all:

IMO.... 968 hands down!  for exactly the opposite reason Daniel Freedman
states.  At the club races I've attended, F is generally one of the =
biggest
classes.  F also has a wide variety of cars so regardless of your
experience/ability level, you will most likely have people to race =
(play)
with.  At a track that favors HP, it may be tough to beat a well
driven/set-up C2 or C4, but on tracks that favor an excellent handling =
car,
the 968 should do very well.  Be prepared to spend the $'s on M030 =
brakes,
limited slip, and all the good suspension goodies.

If '95 993's are moved to D, the 944TS should be very competitive as =
well.
Barry is correct that this car is already track ready as it came from =
the
factory... However,  I think the very competitive cars are set-up far
beyond factory stock.  If you set up your car well and are a very good
driver, would still be lot's of fun... just not as many people to play =
with.

Please let the list know what you decide.
