A Quaiffe and a rebuild for $2500?  Not likely, and if anyone offers to 
do the work for that, run away quickly.  The Quaiffe retails for $1600, 
a proper rebuild will involve replacing the synchros, bearings, and 
seals which will run about $500 to $700 in parts.  There's eight to ten 
hours in a rebuild, another few hours to set up the diff.  Do the math.

The ring and pinion for an 86 Turbo is 016.409.143.AQ and listed, last 
I checked, for $1082.63.  I am not aware of any alternate gearsets 
(ratios) available for the 944 Turbo.  Late eighties, some track folks 
tried running the shorter 944S ring and pinion unsuccessfully -- they 
tended to break pretty consistently under the stress of cars which also 
had been chipped.  It was never too clear to me how good a set-up job 
had been done on these cars' transmissions, but I would assume that at 
least some of them were done properly and all of them seemed to break.
