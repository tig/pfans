Concerning the 944 that would crank but start only at random.  I have an
83 bought new and from since the first year or so of ownership it would
do the same thing. Sometimes it would be everytime and then it might go
for months with no problem.  The first time it happened, I was away from
home and stranded.  In desperation, I wiggled every electrical connector
I could find in the engine compartment and it started.  Thru T&E I
narrowed it down to the engine position and rpm connectors at the back
of the engine on a bracket. I have taken them apart and cleaned them,
checked continuity and it still occasionally doesnt start.  I hop out,
wiggle the connectors and it fires up. I hope this helps.
