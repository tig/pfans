>F.Y.I.  For any one doing a clutch job on a 951, when I bought one of
those
clutch alignment tools - it was stamped "Ford #3" !  I bought mine mail
order, I was given quotes from $6 to $45 (I paid $12, and that was $10 to=
o
much judging from the looks of the S.T.). The "special tool" is plastic a=
nd
looks like it was made in "China Labor Camp" probably at the cost of thre=
e
point six cents! Cheap and light - but it worked! I'm not sure if 944's
have
the same spline pattern? =

<

All the 944s and many Fords have the same spline.  I just finished the
clutch in the S2 and the Ford Ranger has the same spline and disc diamete=
r.
 The only difference is that the S2 disc has a offset for the flywheel
bolts.  The spline tool is a must.
