Hi All,

I know everyone is just dying to know if I finally found a nice 951 :-)
After deciding to go with an independent Porsche shop's inspection to
back-up what the dealer has told me, the simple answer is...  Y E S !

The shop I used is run by the local region PCA president and highly
respected Porsche mechanic.  Basically, he told me the car was gorgeous.
The nicest turbo he'd ever seen.  He said it was immaculate everywhere =
and
that the engine was as clean as new.  The transmission shifted great,
brakes looked and felt great.  Just a great car.  He was familiar with =
the
PO and he said that he was very attentive to details.

The shop owner didn't even charge me anything because he said he didn't =
do
anything that warranted charging me for the evaluation.  While he could
have done compression and leakdown tests he felt it would have been a
waste of time because the car ran SO WELL it couldn't possibly have low
compression.  In fact, his biggest concern was that the car was TOO FAST.
(yippee)  Guess that B&B exhaust and Autothority Stage II really do work!

Geez, it's gonna be really hard sleeping the next 5 nights... wish I was
headin' for Tennessee tomorrow.
