Hi, Alyn

>Dear All
>The end of the passenger foot well (bulkhead or firewall)of my 85 944
contains
>a bank of relays. There are very few  944s around to compare with so can
>anyone confirm if there should be some sort of cover under the dash and
>covering the relays. It looks like there should be. I'm concerned about
>passengers sticking their feet into this area with the obvious results.

Neither of my early 944s had a cover. However, no-one has managed to bash
anything yet. The person that fitted the alarm for a previous owner caused
huge damage, however.

They would work well here in North Wales, too. Especially since my neighbour
has been muckspreading for the last week. The road has disappeared under
smelly mud, and my car is two-tone brown and white.

Having lost a couple of aerials in this way, I have given up trying to save
them, and now buy cheepo manual ones instead. Then, when it gets bent, it's
less than a tenner to replace. I don't fancy the metal drilling that a
roof-mounted one would need. Later cars had screen antennae. Much neater!

Alistair.
