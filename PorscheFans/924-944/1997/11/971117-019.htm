A common syndrome among NA 944 owners.  Don't even think about converting
your '83 to a 951.  Even from a purely economic perspective, it's not
cost-effective.  You haven't yet considered reducing the compression ratio,
adding knock sensors, changing chips (and yours are soldered in), etc. Buy
a 951 and get a turbocharged engine plus all the other upgrades.  I've been
where you're going when I did this the "right" way, with a low-boost
supercharger on an '85, and still got into trouble.  Did I listen to all
the reasonable advice about getting a 951 (as Dave Cooley points out today)
-- not me, I knew better.  Let Porsche build the cars, and save your money
for the one you want.
