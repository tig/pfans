I am aware of all of this. But what kind of block did it have, if not an
Audi one?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All the GTR's had modified 931 engines except (I think) two works cars in
the early eighties.  These cars had blocks designed almost directly from
half of a 928 block.  I saw them in a book at the store, but can't
remember what class they ran in.  They shared little, if any, with the
original 931 engine.  I don't think Motronic was available yet.  Wonder
what ignition and fuel systems they used.
 
Interestingly, I read that the GTR's made 375 HP on the original (albeit
strengthened) 2 liter 931 motor, running 1.5 bar of boost with a 7.1:1 CR.
