PFans:

I recently purchased an '88 951 and shortly thereafter the brake squeal
became unbearable. I replaced all the pads with Textar's (oem) and all
four rotors but I actually have worse squeal now after the replacements.
I've purchased different pads to try and will probably file the edges
but was just wondering if this is normal for 951's as my previous 924S
never had a problem with squeal? 

I also have considerable road wander when driving streets with ruts but
on the interstate or flat streets the car tracks fine. Is the road
wander an issue of the wider and unmatched (in width) 7" & 9" rims? Does
rubber type come into play here? I've replaced the front wheel bearings
but it had no effect. The ball joints didn't "seem" especially loose
when I pried on them. Any other ideas? 

TIA
