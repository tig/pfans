Hello fellow 944 drivers,
  This is my first posting! It is great to see so many of us sharing 
information about a car that I have grown to love dearly. 
  I think someone covered this topic a month ago, but it is now happening to 

me, and I cannot remember the possible causes. I have an 87' 944 NA with 169,

000 miles on it. I have been having a real problem the last two weeks with 
HOT starts. The engine BARELY idles. If you give it any gas, it stalls. The 
only thing I can do, is wait till it "get's over it," and idles normal again 

(about 15-90 seconds). I bit the bullet and got new plugs, wires, cap, and 
rotor (ouch! $$$). The old ones looked shot. I think the wires were 
originals! This did not solve the problem. At all speeds, it runs perfect. 
When idling at a stoplight, it is fine. When starting cold, it is fine. It 
seems like, the longer it sits when shut off hot, the worse it is about 
restarting. HELP!!??
