Hello,

My plain-jane '84 944 is exhibiting a strange behaviour. . .
 -it recently began to idle at 700rpm and the fuel mileage
dropped off to 18-20mpg from 25.  The good symptom is that
it seems to have more get up and go than ever.

I'm aware that the idle is set by the brain, using sensor
inputs from the vacuum hoses, etc.  I poked around with pulling hoses
and such, but the only solid effect I got was when I pulled the small
hose off the manifold side of the throttle body. . .then idle went up
to normal.  Methinks one of the small nylon hoses has worn a hole
in it, or perhaps a vac sensor has gone bad.  This started out as an
intermittent low idle, and now does it consistently low.

I only have a haynes manual, and naturally the manual is vague in this
area as to troubleshooting this sort of problem, so I am consulting the
collective.  Could some kind soul offer tips on checking the myriad of
hoses in the engine vacuum circuitry?

Thanks in Advance. .  A bonus would be the part# of the factory manual
on microfiche. . .I would like to have that in my shop.

Thanks Again,
