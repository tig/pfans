removal of the cat. is indeed illegal, however, unless you are tooling around at
130+ and get pulled over for being an idiot, a cop is not going to think
anything of it...he will think there is a loud car...there is no law however
against having flanges there for the removal of the cat.  dont go to your
inspection with no cat...finally if it is what you want to do then add flanges
and make it easier to remove, other than the fact that it is hotter the hell
there is no reason you could not do it....now whether or not you could actually
melt it doing limited track runs is another question...
