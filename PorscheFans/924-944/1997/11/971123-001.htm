    Sorry, Chris... Many factors affect top speed, but weight (except
    very indirectly) is not one of them.

    Think about WHY there's a top-speed limit at all... I mean, how
    come you can't just put a really tall 5th gear in a car and
    accelerate all the way up to 600 MPH or beyond?

    The reason is friction, of which there are three main sources:
    Aerodynamic drag, frictional losses through the drivetrain, and 
    friction between the tires and the road.

    The loss from each of these sources increases geometrically with
    increased speed.  Eventually, you reach a point where all the
    engine's power is being used to overcome these losses, so none is
    left over for acceleration.

    Weight affects none of these drag sources except tire friction,
    and even then, its effect is COMPLETELY overwhelmed by
    aerodynamic losses. If you could load up your 944 with a couple
    tons of lead, it'd only drop the top speed by maybe 10 MPH or so.
