After reading Farzaan's great post on boost control, I decided to go take a 
look at my 951.  My intent was to visualize what Farzaan had described.  What 
I found was that the hose that goes from the wastegate to the cycling valve 
was hard as a rock and severely cracked.  When I reached up to feel, it broke 
off in my hand.  I did not notice any abnormal boost conditions before putting 
the car up on jack stands a couple months ago.  It is no wonder that this hose 
went bad, it was unprotected and only 5" from the header.

Has anyone else experienced this problem.  Is this hose supposed to be 
protected, tied out of the way form the header or something.  The hose used 
appears to be 6mm fuel line, not just vacuum line.  Any ideas for a better 
replacement material or routing of the hose?
