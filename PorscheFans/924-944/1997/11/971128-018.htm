<<I would also highly recommend a pre-purchase inspection.  In my recent
screw-job I was taken, but that is not usually the case.  Actually, I
heard from my local PCar mechanic that many shops in California will NOT
do pre-purchase inspections anymore because of the liability of missing
something.  They will inspect for certain things, such as a compression
check, but they won't guarantee whether a car is good or not.  Anyone
heard the same rumor?>>

Hi Tom,

So sorry to hear about your misfortune. I know you must be very
disappointed. But I'd hang in there and wait for the right 951S - you
won't be sorry. If you haven't already done so, please write a letter to
PCNA describing the acts of the dealership, the PCA member, and the
other garage. It is simply disgusting. I'd make a point of demanding a
refund from the dealership of your travel expenses. It would also make a
good way to make sure PCNA is following up on the whole matter.

Regarding California mechanics and the law, I guess they will use the
same out as the state legislators so the worthiness of your purchase can
be decided by state referendum instead of a vote for which they could be
held accountable. But it is still unfortunate that liability issues are
masking the real issues of basic competency and thievery.

Regards,

Paul Foster
'89 951 that I like more every day
