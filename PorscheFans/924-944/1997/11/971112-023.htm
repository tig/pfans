Don't get me wrong, I love 944's but my experience with my '87 NA would
indicate that you certainly don't want to rely on it working everyday.  The
problem with Porsche's (like all complicated machines for that matter) is
that they break.  I remember when I first bought mine and brought it out to
show my mechanic his first comment was "you did keep your other car didn't
you?"  Of course I had.  As you undoubtedly already know, 944's are also
generally expensive to fix when they do break, unless you have the tools and
place to do all of your own repairs.  My advice is get her a nice used GTI
and she may even have enough money to buy groceries and stuff (grin).
