               I own a 944 '83 that is nearly perfect, it has 120 K on 
it and has been in the family ever since it left Nekarsulm. I've 
recently turned 21 and my parents have passed it over to me. I am very 
pleased with the handling and the top end performance, although I feel 
the engine with the proper gearing could do 10 or 20 km/h more. With 
what I am not satisfied with is it's acceration. According to specs. 
I've read up on, the 951 has the same engine displacement and makes the 
car an entire different thing, i.e. 0-100 from 8.2 to 5.7, and that 
stock! I see the turbo, and maybe some exhaust modification to be the 
remedy. My question is wheather this can be done, can the crankshaft, 
clutch, transmission, diferiencial, axel, etc. handle the H.P.
