This seems to be a common occurrance with cars that don't have center
caps on their wheels.  I've noticed that my bearing caps always protrude
about a 1/2 inch out when I remove my wheels after a track event.  I
simply push them back in.

---disclaimer, do at your own risk---

I guess drilling a very small hole in the cap itself would prevent
pressure from building up in the hub and force the cap off.  If you
drilled a small enough hole you might be able to avoid contaminating
your wheel bearings with dirt and water.

I think the safest thing is to just get some cheap wheel caps.


Just my 2 cents.
