1986 951, 127k miles, has a kind of rattly noise from the engine
compartment.  One dealer said it was from the exhaust system and nothing
could be done, another dealer says it is the turbo.  The car runs fine,
the noise has existed for probably 20k miles (previous owner info and
receipts).  The only reason I noticed it is that I had my car parked
next to another '86 951 and his is very quiet.  The noise is almost the
noise you would get from an old fan with a bent housing where the fan
blade is striking the housing in going 'round.  Since the noise has been
there 20k miles I'd assume the turbo (full boost no problem) would have
destroyed itself if this were coming from there.  The turbo water pump
works, there were new headers installed under the cracked header
warranty phase of 944 debugging, both fans work fine and quietly.  It is
just this little, tiny metal/metal noise...
Any ideas folks?

Dana
