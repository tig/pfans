Clark Archer asked about DIY on coupler tightening.  Here is my response:

On my coupler, one of the allen head bolts was loose.  This was from a clutch
job I had had done.  The guy even left his Allen head socket (actually just
the hexagonal portion) laying in the bottom of the bellhousing!  I used a
non-Porsche shop for my 951 clutches-- they charged only $450 for labor, and
otherwise did a fine job.

Anyway, the bolt head was somewhat damaged, so I bought a new one and torqued
both to the factory spec.  I bought a spare coupler for $25 just in case.

You can access the coupler through a larger rectangular port toward the front
of the tranny on the passenger side.  There is a rubber cover.  You will have
to use a socket/swivel set-up to get at the bolts.

This problem was found when I had my car tech inspected prior to the start of
the AX/track season at Ken's Sportech in Campbell, CA.  The guys heard a
squeaking sound, which I had noticed but ignored.  They were meticulous when
they went over the car, also finding a recently broken alternator mounting
bolt.

My point here is that despite all of the fine info which we all share, our
own frequent safety/technical inspections, and our growing mechanical skills,
it pays to have some pros look over the car once or twice a year.  In my
case, Ken Mack and his crew saved my some potential paddock frustrations.
