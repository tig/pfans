During the drive home from work the rear wiper unexpectedly quit halfway 
through its stroke.  The motor continued to run the entire way home, as 
the wiper could not park to trigger the motor off.

I removed and disassembled the unit.  Quite a bit of nasty, dried up 
grease and some accumulated water(!) in there.

The mechanism is a worm gear drive arrangement.  The driven gear appears 
to be made of some sort of bakelite or some other non-metal substance.  
The teeth have worn away, causing the failure.

Can the parts knowledgeable on the list tell me if the gear is available as 
a separate part, or will I have to replace the entire motor assembly?
I'd like a little advance notice before I start calling around tomorrow 
morning.

At least with the wiper out, I can paint the washer that sits on the 
glass (the wiper shaft passes through it). It has long faded from its 
original black to varying shades of grey.

Thanks in advance for any info.

 -Gregor  944 2.7. No rear Viper.
