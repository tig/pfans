Sure: W6WS.  By the way, credit for this idea should go to
a pal of mine who has an '85 944.  Mine is an '86 so I know that
the mounting holes exist across the 85 1/2 redesign.

The first time I tried a mag mount on my 944 I discovered that
it doesn't 'stick' to the sunroof...  Mag mounts apparently don't
work well at HF due to poor coupling with the car body.  I've heard
even worse things about glass mount antennas.  This is less of
a problem at VHF/UHF frequencies.

I'm not sure what to recommend for CB.  I don't do any long
distance driving in my 944 so haven't seriously investigated an
HF setup for it.
