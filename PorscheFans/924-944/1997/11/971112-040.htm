Subject: VIN number question

Hey P-Fans:

I have a question about 944 S2 VIN numbers.  Most 944 numbers in 1989 (or
other years, for that matter) are things like WP0AB2942KN450206.  However,
some have the ninth digit as an X, instead of the 2 as underlined in the
above example, e.g., WP0AB294XLN450206.  Why are some of these ninth digits
X's instead of numbers?  Incidentally, I've seen this on some turbo VIN's
I've seen in Excellence, too. If anybody knows, I'd appreciate illumination.

Thanks!

Terry

Dear Terry & P-Fans
	The "ninth didget" (counting left to right) in the VIN number is a "test
didget" or "filling character". The tenth didget designates the model year,
ei: in your case the "K" is for the 1989 M.Y.   

Here are the A,B, C's of Model Year ( M.Y.) Codes:

Cars starting with 1980 on,  use this system.
A for 1980 and so on, the system skips letters that can be confused with each
other or numbers. Like " i "  "O" & "Q". Cars built in for the US market,
prior to 1980 M.Y.,had a sticker in the drivers door jam, labeling the M.Y.

A = '80
B = '81
C = '82
D = '83
E = '84
F = '85
G = '86
H = '87
J =  '88
K = '89
L = '90
M = '91
N = '92
P = '93
R = '94
S = '95
T = '96
U = '97
V = '98
W = '99

VIN #'s for Porsche's the 4th thru 6th didgets "AAO" designate USA car. If
the car was built for "European Market" it would have "ZZZ'. One note all
Porsche's have "ZZZ" stamped into the body, by the battery on 924/944's but
the the A-pillar and drivers door jam will still say "AAO"!
