        Ok, My friend has a 1993 Toyota MR2 and I was with him the
other day and we were on these fantastic backroads and he had that
car pushed to the limit and it was remarkable. Now my question is
if anyone knows the .?? g's on a 86' porsche 944turbo vs. a 93 MR2
that would be great. I looked through all my magazine and could not
find the #'s. Or if no one has that, which one in general do you think
would handle better on the twisties??
        Because I know the 944's have been refered back to
in recent magazines for its perfect weight bias and its superb =

handling.
        Thanks,
Sam Grant
86' 951...BRAND NEW HEADER ON THE WAY!!!!!! :):):):):):)
