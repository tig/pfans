I need a high quality car cover for my '91 944s2 cab, and was wondering 
if anyone had any suggestions (needs to survive rain, snow, cold)

I have catalogs from "performance products" and "motor cars
international".  Both had equally good sounding covers, but I just called
in an order to motor cars because they were a little less expensive. Well,
much to my surprise, the cost ended up being about $266, but I went with
it for now because I'm desperate to get something before the North East
winter snows start (sorry, no garage! I live in an appt complex). 

Thanks in advance for any help,
