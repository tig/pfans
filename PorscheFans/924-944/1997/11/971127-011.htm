I have bought two cars long distance here in New Zealand (both,
coincidentally, from Christchurch in the South Island). The first (a 85.5
NA) was advertised in a Car Trader magazine. I flew done and had a look,
took it for a test drive, did a deal (inclusing 24 months mechanical
warranty), and bought it.

That was three years agao, and the car proved to be a good buy - more
through luck as I didn't really get it checked. I did check out the dealer
- how long in business, what type of cars the on-site workshop had, how
clean the shop and staff were, etc.

Three months ago, after a month of looking and a week of negotiating on a
local 86 951, I saw a 952 advertised in the paper. I rang, they sent
photos, we talked money. I agreed to purchase the car if it checked out. My
local mechanic suggested I ring the local Porsche agent and talk with a
particular mechanic. I did. The guy knew of the car and was prepared to go
over it for me (I specified the full works - everything gone over). I
called back the dealer and said told him that I wanted the car taken to
this shop for a check, and he had no problem with that.

Next day I had faxed to me a very comprehensive report (right down to tyre
tread depths). I rang the shop and spoke with the mechanic at length,
asking about each item, and asking for his impressions of how it drove,
interior and exterior marks, etc. I said because I was taking up a lot of
time on the phone to charge for it at normal rates (he declined!).

Then I rang the dealer again, said I wanted all the faults fixed, and the
car re-checked by the same guy at the shop before I went ahead. Dealer
agreed, and said he'd get my shop to do most of the work. Throughout the
process, I liaised with my local mechanic here, getting him to go over the
inspection report and relaying the comments of the guy down South.

Over the next few days I rang the shop two or three times to see how it was
going and whether any other problems had cropped up. Once satisfied, I did
the deal by phone and fax. The car was shipped to me, and I shipped my old
85.5 NA as a trade to them (dealer got me to have it checked at a shop they
used here - a good place with a good reputation, so that was also
re-assuring).

Result: I'm the happy owner of an ex-UK Panther Black 952 (there were only
ever two imported into New Zealand new - and neither have leather sports
seats!!) and also have a 24 month mechanical warranty on this car too.

Lessons: talk with local people you trust to see if they know of others in
the area; find out from the seller of the car which businesses they deal
with in your area (and go visit and talk with them); get a pre-purchase
check; get a mechanical warranty (peace-of-mind is worth it); and be
prepared to live with the consequences of long-distance buying.

Not sure if much (or even any) of this advice applies in the US. Here in
NZ, most people are reasonably trust-worthy and honest :-)

Cheers, Gary
