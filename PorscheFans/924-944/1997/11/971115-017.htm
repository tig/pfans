Dear Azim:
        I don't know if this is any easier than Marv's suggestion, but here
goes:
        On my '83 NA, I once over-tightened the locknut on the hood latch
and accidently overtightened the latching mechanism, so the cable would not
release the hood.
        I was able to see the hood latch (the long bolt-shaped latch on the
hood with the bulb on it that locks into the release mechanism-sorry for
the non-technobabble) by crawling under the car with the front end up on
ramps. Using a very long and large screwdriver, I was able to get the end
of the screwdriver into the slot on the locking bolt. Putting a vice grip
or adjustable wrench on the flats of the screwdriver shaft, I was able to
turn the lock bolt enough to loosen the mechanism and release it. I
presumably should have been able to completely unscrew the lock bolt from
the hood.  You might try this.  Hopefully, the lock nut is not too tight.
        This probably would not work on a 951 because there is way too much
stuff in the way, but you can crawl under your car and check to see if you
can see the parts.

Good luck,
