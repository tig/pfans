The wiring diagram from the shop manual for the 1986 944 clearly
shows three speakers in each door.  It is certainly possible that
there were other configurations in other years/models.  I'm not
sure how Porsche positioned the three speakers.  The day I looked
at the microfiche at the parts counter, I didn't have much time
to spend.  So only got a brief look and prices of a couple of
the parts.

I'm still deciding the direction I want to proceed with my
speaker replacement.  The old Blau speakers are better than
what GM was putting in cars at the time, but they just use
whizzer cones for high frequency dispersion.  Deep bass
is non-existant.  And who knows how much power they can handle?
My new radio can probably deliver 5x more power to each one
than was possible with the Monterey.  Its specs are something
like 4x25 watts peak and 4x15 watts continuous - typical of
most higher end radios these days.  I think the Blau was 2x8
watts peak and 2x5 watts continuous.

I'm intentionally restricting myself to making things sound as
good as possible using the factory cutouts and grills.  However
using some of that hardware from the upgraded system might be neat
way to give myself some extra latitude using off-the-shelf parts.
(I hate the thought of some teenage car stereo monkey sawing
arbitrary holes in my doors.)
