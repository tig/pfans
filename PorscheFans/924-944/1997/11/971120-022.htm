I don't have the numbers on me but here are my feelings on the handling:

The 944 is a very solid handling car that does very well on sweepers and
the such.  I find that the 944 is a bit heavy for the tight corners and is
not quite as nimble as my other car (E30 M3.)  Overall I think you would
beat a MR2 in the twisties on the overall package.  You should have more
power and good handling.  While the MR2 may be more nimble, I doubt it will
make up for the loss in power.  Also, I would bet that your 951 has wider
rubber than the MR2.  I have only driven one MR2, and I didn't get the
feeling that it could handle as well as a 914...  Now if your friend has a
MR2 Turbo, you may have some problems...  But if I am looking to go fast on
a twisty road, my M3 would have to be my first choice (or maybe a 914-6),
but if there are any straights, the 951 could make up time pretty quickly!  

Note: The twisty roads I take are VERY twisty.  For those of you in the Bay
Area, try Old Page Mill road to Pescadero.  Another good one (alttle less
tight) is 84 from Woodside to the Ocean.  Unfortunately, like much of
California, these roads are often over populated...
