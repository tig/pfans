Yep, clutch slave cylinder failure...fairly easy job.=20

You need jackstands (the taller and stronger, the better). Have plenty=20
of brake fluid handy...

The slave cylinder is held captive by the starter. Remove the battery
cables. Remove the starter.

Remove the hose to the slave cylinder. Remove the two 13 mm bolts =
holding
the slave cylinder to the bell housing.

Install the slave cylinder. Install the hose.

Now for the fun part: bleed the slave cylinder. You need two people to
do this, the car must be jacked up in the rear (with the rear bumper =
about
two feet higher than the front bumper, if possible) so that the air =
bubble
which is captive in the slave cylinder heads for the bleeder valve at=20
the rear of the slave cylinder. Bleed till the clutch pedal gets hard
and you can see the rod pushing the clutch release fork.

Replace the starter when you are satisfied with the bleed job.

Drive it till it needs another slave cylinder.

I'm on my 3rd one (83 944/110K miles)

Good Luck!
