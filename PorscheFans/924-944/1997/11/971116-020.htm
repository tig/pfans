Thanks to all for the suggestions.  I know have enough knowledge to open any
bonnet on any year <g>.  My 944 is an S2 (same config as the 951s) so the
answer was;

1: put the front of the car on jack stands
2. Remove the forward undertray by removing the screws and two nuts that
attach the tray to the front spoiler.
3. Remove the second undertray (covers the anti roll bar etc) which is
attached by 10mm hex bolts.
4. This will allow you to put your hand (unless you are a bit of gorilla) up
in front of the radiator and push the hood release leave to the left (like
the cable normally would).  It takes a lot of pressure to release this catch
so I got an assistant to depress the bonnet (carefully) with their palm in
the area of the latch and that took the pressure off the latch  so it was
easy to release the latch just with fingers. No need for any other
implements.

Thanks again for all your help.

Azim
