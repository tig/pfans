Newbie here so forgive me if this question has been covered over and =

get some info on it before I buy. I had a 914 2.0 and a 924 Turbo many =
years back. What does the Turbo S have that the standard Turbo doesn't, =
i.e.. horsepower, drivetrain, suspension set-up. Any problem areas to =
look for. What type of major maintenance items should I look for to have =
been done. How many Turbo S's were made. Any performance numbers would =
be greatly appreciated(13.5 ET's?) What would the price range be for an =
89 Turbo S, $10,000 to $15,000? Thanx in advance, George in Cleveland, =
rochford@ncweb.com. 97 Audi A4 1.8 Turbo quattro with chip upgrade from =
TAP.
