	Not a problem, this whole thing is just a fun way to kill time
till we get back on the track

	Forget the Speedo, learn to use your other facilities, Hearing,
balance, touch. Our computers only have so much bandwidth per input
device (mind <- eye etc). So if you learn to use them all you will be
far better off. 

		Sound - will tell you what the motor speed is, and when
it is coming up to fast. When the tires are close to limits. When the
road surface changes
		Balance - "Feel the car" the really good part of seat
time is that you can learn to feel the car in your butt. (sort like
dancing)
		Touch - "feel the car sing" get the feedback from the
wheel through your hand, the brakes from your toes, the clutch from the
toes.
		Fear - "it's gods way of letting you know there is a
lesson about to be learned.
		Excites - "What you feel when things are done right"

		Put your whole body to work not just your eyes.

		Yes I spent a few days at the track off and on for the
last 15 years, I teach, learn, and race. Keep an eye out for me at east
coast events, car is RED #40 (914). We run under the name "Red Car
Racing" (get it Red Car - real clever hu ?)

		And stay on the black stuff, unless you can find a
shorter path.
