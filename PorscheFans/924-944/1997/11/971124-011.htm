First of all, I wish to express my gratitude to the multitudes of list
members who responded to my question.  In random order, I wish to
specifically thank Doug Donsbach, BadBob951, Larry White, Jim Vienneau,
Dan Webb, George Hussey of AutoAtlanta and Michael Stewart Fields.  Many
also replied to the list, I wish to thank them, too again, for their
information.

Some of the email suggestions were:
Contact cleaner and possibly dielectric grease from Pep Boys.
Wurth Contact OL #89360
Red One or Big Red, apparently not commonly available except for
industrial supply houses.
Radio Shack Contact Cleaner #64-3322.
CO Contact Cleaner (part # 02016) from CRC. 
Stabilant 22, www.stabilant.com, but not for low-voltage applications.
Check with TechniTool, DigiKey, and Newark Electronics

CRC's QD Electronic Cleaner found at the NAPA store and tuner cleaners,
including that of Radio Shack got thumbs down as they contain lubricants
and leave residue when dry.

The ingredients Trichlorotrifluoroethane 76-13-1 and Chlorodifluoromethane
75-45-6, were mentioned in products that were found effective.

Useful phone numbers:
CRC 800-521-3168 for Technical Information and 800-272-8963 for Customer
Service. 
Wurth 800-526-5228.

Many suggested caution when these were used around plastics, especially
clear plastics as they tend to lose clarity.

Once more, thank you everyone!!
