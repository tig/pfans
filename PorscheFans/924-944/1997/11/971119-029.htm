Ok, here's the deal. I have an '85A model 944 and I want to juice the
engine up 'a bit'. I live in Finland and the tax jungle here is pure hell.
If I would trade my 944 to a 951 I'd have to pay about $10 000 US along
with my car. Hey, I'm not kidding about the $10K.
  I have a plan.. To buy a 944 turbo engine from Germany(where the engines
are a lot cheaper) with some other stuff, like the exhaust and possibly a
brake upgrade. A turbo installation to my current engine would cost me more
than buying a whole new engine, right?
  Isn't it true that the engine mounts and everything else between the
engines are the same so that I could basically just 'throw' the engine in
and what other things should I keep in mind? (I do know that I'd have to
replace the radiator etc. exept the waterpump) I'm not sure about the
clutch.. How much can it handle and what do you think about the Centerforce
clutch packages??

PS. To all German porschefans: How much does a 944 turbo engine cost or a
wrecked 944?
