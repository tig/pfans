I have a short story I thought I would share with the group.

This last August I saw a mint condition 1978 Porsche 924 setting in this =
gentleman's driveway. I stopped in and talked shop with him, but I did =
not buy the car, as I already owned one. I forgot about the car untill =
I saw the ad in the paper again. This time it was listed as a parts car. =
Parts car? I thought to myself. I called on it and yes it was being sold =
as a parts car. The gentleman told me on the phone " You'll have to take =
a look at it and see if you can use what's left of it".

I had seen the car, and knew that it had been perfect but I wasn't prepar=
ed for what I saw when I got there. Every window had been smashed out, =
and it sat there with a tarp covering the once perfect paint job. Vandals=
 had done this, and worse yet the man had dropped his car insurance becau=
se he hadn't been driving it. So instead of a nice car, he was selling =
a parts car. So I guess no matter how bad your day is going, It probably =
isn't as bad as his was...

Anyway. The car does have a nice brown interior, and the motor and transm=
ition was in good condition when he parked it. If anyone needs a light =
brown interior piece. I should start parting the car out in the next week=
 or two. Let me know if I can help you out with a part.

P.S. It has a glass sun roof. How can you tell if it's an after market =
or a saratoga top? Is there any pictures of a saratoga on the net?

Thanks...
