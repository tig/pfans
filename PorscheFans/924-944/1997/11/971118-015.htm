Some have asked about the removal of the cat on 951 track cars.  I bought a
used assembly from a local parts supplier and punched out the ceramic
material with a piece of steel pipe.  It took quite a while to get it all
out, and I couldn't access the separate material in the wastegate pipe that
runs parallel to the main chamber.  I run this set-up on the car for the
track.  I haven't noticed and change in power, or general performance, but I
believe what Jim Pasha says: this will help preserve my original cat, since
the car gets really hot on the track.  The original unit sits in my garage
for street use.  The only change I've noted is a slightly nosier exhaust
note.

I haven't heard definitively that a modestly expensive set of replacement
exhaust parts (e.g., Borla, B&B or other) can add any performance or
reliability, so I haven't invested in these items.  Mr. Milledge tells me
that there are some HP gains to be made, but it costs big $$$$ for a full
custom fabrication.  He has made 'em for several customers.

I can heartily recommend running a punched-out cat for the track.
