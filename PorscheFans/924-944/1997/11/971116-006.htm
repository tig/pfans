Is this a bad dream?  This happened to me line by line.  The problem, as 
I see it, was the failure to use LEFT handed drills to drill the plug for 
the easy out.

After some serious flushing, I too, was unable to recover the plug.  I 
resigned to leave it where it was and hope it does not cause a coolant 
thrombosis.

Let me know if you have better luck
