Friends:

Anyone have a hard copy of the original specs for the M030 suspension option
for a 85.5 944? I've combed the factory shop and parts manual but am afraid I
may have missed something. PCNA Customer Assistance doesn't have that
available (although they tried very hard and I appreciate the effort). 

My car came with the 456 option that I understand had the upgraded front and
rear bars and Koni's and if I am reading the parts book right, the M030 had
in addition shorter, stiffer front springs and a slightly larger torsion bar
diameter. If you have a hard copy showing exactly what's included, I would
appreciate a faxed copy at 956-686-3221. If you don't have a hard copy but
can confirm my suspicions, please email me. TIA

I've been buying a lot of parts and thought I would pass along some of what
I've found from the various mail order houses. All the prices went into a
spreadsheet and then the phone calls started (hey- what I save on parts I get
to spend in tools, right? ;-)

Automotion-Most everything in stock. When they had their 20% off sale last
month they were finally competitive price-wise. Bought some really nice race
harness belts at their Garage Sale web site for $80! Check it out 2x a month.
:-|

Auto Atlanta- In spite of reading some of the other lister's experience, I
went ahead. They had some better prices on a few items, plus they had a
package with all the 944 water hoses. Well, I placed my order on the 15th
(Sat) that George said would be shipped Monday the 17th, but without the rear
Cool Carbons. It still hadn't arrived by the 25th- what's the deal? I finally
called them the next day- it didn't ship til the 21st and still only a
partial (no cool carbons front OR rear or water wetter). Bummer. Just glad
I'm not racing for another month. :-(

Paragon- Jason's great (and free ground frt). Good advice direct from the
man. See next vendor. :-)

Europroducts- Advertised a Weltmiester front bar for 299- Automotion's SALE
price was $350. Said no way they could sell it for 299, must be a misprint,
but by then the Automotion sale was over. Called me back saying could do for
$340, I said OK. Got invoice for $340, plus $10 credit card charge (never
mentioned and I think illegal- can discount for cash but not upcharge for cc)
plus shipping. Should have bought it from Jason and paid the sales tax. :-(

Don McGill (P Dlr in Houston)- Faxed a list of 15 items I wanted to price at
8AM Monday without part numbers, was on my desk 2 hours later w/ PN's and
prices. 20% discount for PCA or Excellence. By far the least expensive
compared to anyone above for disposables (oil & fuel filters) and stuff I
need to make sure is factory spec (suspension bushings and the like). Only
had backorder on one item, but they erred when it was sent to the billing
address instead of the shipping address. :-)

Performance Products- No problems, timely and in stock. Had to return 2 items
(my error, not theirs). They don't even require you to phone ahead to send
stuff back. Cool. :-)

AAA Small Car World in Fort Worth TX (used parts). Needed (wanted?) a set of
16 x 7/8 wheels for a-x. Robert Wood & Wheel Enhancement had them for $1200
plus shipping!!! Jeez- I need tires to go with them, guys! Called AAA (see
Hemmings under "P Parts For Sale") on recommendation from P friend at work.
They arrived yesterday and look just fine. No they're not concours quality
(tho I'll know more once I get them cleaned up) but have a 91 day moneyback
satisfaction guarantee. $425 for the set of 4 INCLUDING shipping. All right!
Where's my number for Tire Rack... :-)))

Thanks to everyone that responded to my initial questions a couple of weeks
ago.

McAllen Texas (almost the end of the world but we can race ALL YEAR ROUND!)

85.5 944 N/A (soon to have new sport Koni's, R1's, Cool Carbons w/steel
lines, Weltmeister front bar, new tierods, Hotwires (and I'm hoping NOT new
front A-arms).
