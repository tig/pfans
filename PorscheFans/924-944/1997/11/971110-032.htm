Howdy guys,

In the previous email, we covered the basics of the mechanical boost controller
in the 944T, now we'll discuss the electronic gizmos that control the boost
in a very sophisticated manner.

We previously discussed the mechanic method of boost control using a bleeder
valve to trick the wastegate to stay shut longer.  The mechanical method
is sometimes finicky, when using bleeder valves because of temperature and
humidity.  While newer methods of mechanical boost control have almost
eliminated that problem, the technology available in 1980's was just not
there for the Porsche engineers to use.  More importantly, they wouldn't
have wanted to use that technology anyways because they were FAR ahead of
the industry in what they did on the 944T in terms of boost control and
turbocharger management.

When using a bleeder valve, people usually notice an increase in turbo lag.
This is because no matter what you do, the wastegate will always sense
some signal, for example, if you have 0.7 bar of boost in the intake and
you are bleeding 0.6 bar constantly, the wastegate still sees 0.1bar and
as we know, our wastegate opens fully at 0.2bar.  Since these are not
instant open doors, the wastegate will start to crack open at 0.1bar of
pressure and increase turbo lag.  Another problem with bleeder valves
is spiking where the wastegate cannot react fast enough when the throttle
is first applied.  Porsche dealt with all of these problems using a clever
boost controller, the Cycling Valve.  All that the cycling valve is is
a solenoid that controls the bleeding of intake pressure, the only difference
being that this was electronically controllable.

The cycling valve has three vacuum lines coming into it, one from the
intercooler pipe on the intake, one going to a vent (probably back into
the intake manifold somewhere) and the last going to the wastegate.  By
controlling the opening of the solenoid usually through continious pulses,
the KLR can control the boost pressure by modifying the amount of pressure
to bleed.  The cycling valve has a range that it can adjust, from about
0.2bar to 0.8bar with a normal banjo bolt.

So, now remember back to our purely mechanical system, all that the electronic
version does is control the bleed in a more precise manner.  The KLR has an
intake pressure line coming into the box so I will assume that it takes a 
reading and adjusts for altitude, temperature and humidity to try and give
you the highest possible boost pressure that the factory wanted you to have.

Now, new age electronic boost controllers have various features which set
them apart from factory electronic boost controllers.  The Porsche system
is unique in that it has a pressure line coming into the computer, most
solenoid type systems used on other cars only use the solenoid to reduce
boost during knock conditions.  For example, the Talon uses a solenoid that
is normally open.  This system bleeds 3psi of boost to allow the car to run
around 11psi of boost;  the wastegate spring in that car is set at 8psi.
When the ECU detects knock, it pulses the solenoid to close the bleed and
sell full signal to the wastegate which brings the boost down to 8psi then.

In recent years, the japanese tuner companies have gotten a stranglehold
on the boost controller market and when the japanese get involved in
something, you know a good thing will come out.  And so the HKS EVC I was
born, the first really high tech boost controller.  This unit had one
input and two outputs, in much the same way as the Porsche cycling valve.
The one input was from the intake system, one output to the wastegate and
one output to vent back to the intake.  Unlike the Porsche system which
seems to be normally closed (in that it does not bleed pressure until 
necessary), the HKS EVC did not send ANY signal to the wastegate until the
very last moment, so it was always bleeding until the very last moment.
What this did was keep the wastegate COMPLETELY closed until the desired
boost pressure was reached, once the pressure was about 0.05bar under
what you had dialed in, it sent a pressure signal burst to the wastegate
which sent the door open and allowed the wastegate to start getting rid of
excess exhaust.

This system gave consistent, powerful boost.  The method of holding shut
the wastegate to the last possible moment allowed cars to accerate harder
in 1st and 2nd gear where the lower engine loads normally do not allow the
wastegate to stay closed for much time and cars were able to get better
0-60 and 1/4 mile times on STOCK boost pressure, just by using an EVC.
You will notice in the 944T, it does not make full boost pressure when
chipped in 1st or 2nd gear because of this wastegate getting signal problem.
My 944T, as well as Paul's and Darrens produce 0.8bar in 1st, 1bar in 2nd,
1.07bar in 3rd and 1.07bar in 4th and 1.07bar in 5th.  If I had an EVC in
my car, my boost would be closer to 1.07bar in each gear.  The EVC would
work very hard to try and get that boost in each gear so you can see why
it would be faster with the same boost pressure.

I think Porsche knew about this type of system since it's quite simple to
implement with the hardware they had, but the rush of boost in 1st and 2nd
must have had the bean counters freaking that the 944T might be labeled
as another hard to handle 930 with the engine up front.  Instead we got
a very smooth, but rather dull 1st and 2nd.  Ever notice that the 944T
seems to accelerate with the same thrust in 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears?  Well,
now you know why.  I find 4th the most enjoyable :)

Now that the japanese were in the boost controller building industry, things
could only get better.  HKS is an awesome company with extremely talented
people, the majority of japanese tuner owners in this day and age were
previously employed in some form at HKS.  HKS's EVC I had some problems,
it would spike occasionally and the temp/humidity control was better than
the bleeders, but still not full computer controlled, you set the dial in
the cockpit and it tried to do it's best to meet your requirements.

In comes the latest and greatest EVC IV (I'll skip the other ones in between
because they were evolutionary models).  The EVC III was actually very
sophisticated, but many problems plagued this unit, it was smarter than its
owners who couldn't figure out how to program the damn thing.  The EVC IV
ATM has atmospheric control as mentioned in a previous article.  The EVC IV
also has a feature called fuzzy logic.  You set your boost where you want
it, then do two full throttle runs in your highest boost producing gear
(4th in our cars).  The EVC IV will learn the characteristics of your car's
boost control methods and will maximize the set boost pressure in all
conditions including low engine load conditions in 1st and 2nd gear.  This
system always produces the exact same boost regardless of conditions, etc.

There is one problem though, some have said the EVC is not compatible with
the Porsche external wastegate because it is a dual port design and the
EVC only has an output for the wastegate.  I'm still investigating why we
can't use it and will get back to the list when I figure it out or someone
explains it to me.

As you can see, the whole boost control system is relatively simple stuff.
Think back to the mechanical method of simple pressure to wastegate theory
and it all becomes easy to understand how the gizmos in between do their
job of giving you brain splattering acceleration :)

In the next part, I'll talk about the common methods of increasing the
boost on 944T's and how they interface with the above mentioned sections
of the boost control mechanism.
