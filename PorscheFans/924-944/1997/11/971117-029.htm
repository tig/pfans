Pre-purchase checks usually give you ammo to knock the price down with.
          There is always something wrong with a used car that the owner
          doesn't know about. Never had an inspection that didn't at least
          save me the $100-$200 that the inspection costs. Sometimes, you
          can even get the inspector to send you a video:) No kidding. If
          you are the kind who cares about accidents ( my view is if it has
          been on the road, then it has been hit), then don't be shy about
          getting a Porsche-only mechanic AND a body shop/concours
          restoration person to check it out. Note that on a Porsche, lack
          of any paintwork/bodywork can be good for a 10% difference in
          price (this I do care about) on an otherwise perfect car.
