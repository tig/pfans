BTW, what are the shift speeds in the 968? I know the 6th gear has been
termed an "economy" gear. Think the lower gears would offer that much of =
an
advantage on the track?

6th gear in the 968 is not an economy gear and yes the lower gears to =
can offer a substantial advantage depending on the track.  Excellence =
magazine did a great piece on the 968 where they write specifically =
about the gear ratios and how the ratio spacing did a much better job of =
keeping the engine in the torque curve than the 951S, especially in =
auto-x events.

As to the "shift speeds"  redline (6750) equals: (approx. speeds)

1st   42 mph
2nd  62 mph
3rd  85 mph
4th  105 mph

I haven't found the shift speeds for 5th and 6th is supposed to go right =
up to the redline at 156 mph.  I have been to 140 mph in 5th and still =
had rpm remaining, although at that speed I am paying more attention to =
the road than to the speedometer and/or tach.

If you want the actual gear ratios for the 6 gears, let me know and I =
will look them up in the manual.
