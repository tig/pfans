>Hi Bill,

Well, to begin with, I was looking for a Club racing car.  So weight was a
major concern.  The '86 is the lightest of the 951s.  Second, I like that
the car doesn't have airbags.  If I got a car with airbags, I would not be
allowed to change the steering wheel according to PCA club rules in the
classes I plan to run.  A smaller steering wheel can help with fatigue and
actually improve track times...

>Did you not want ABS or something?  

I haven't decided wheather or not ABS is an advantage on the track.

Well, in the end it was.  I figured that if I got an S model, at almost
twice the cost, I would be much more worried about putting the car into a
wall.  If I didn't have this concern I might be racing my M3 also.

I also discussed with many current racers, and many have confirmed that the
'86 cars seem to be quicker than the later cars at the track.  I have even
been told by one guy out there on the net that his '86 keeps up with many
of the S models on the track....
