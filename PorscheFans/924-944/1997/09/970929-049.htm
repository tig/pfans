Just when I was getting good at replacing clutches it seems that the 
opportunity presents itself one more time.  I still have my 944S to do 
next year, but that will be a picnic compared to my Turbo that is leaking 
oil out the rear main seal.

After much tissue stuffing up and around the rear main seal, I have come 
to the delusion that the new rear main seal I put in about four months 
ago has been one of the chief causes of my oil leakage.  Careful 
inspection of the tail end of the crank shaft shows no sign of oil around 
the shaft, but a wad of tissues tucked tightly in between the flywheel 
and main seal itself gathers oil.  The tissue is stuffed above the ridge 
where the oil pan and crank case meet, so no oil is riding in that 
groove.  In fact, the grove is bone dry.

I installed this seal with a block of wood and tapping with a hammer.  
Have I missed something with my installation?  What possible reasons 
would the rear main seal fail, presumably upon installation?

Has anyone advice on proper seal installation?  Any sealant to apply 
between the crank case and outer seal edge?  I enjoy working on my car, 
but this is not productive.  Time to get that transaxle adapter ready...

What is ironic is that I replaced this seal as preventative maintenance 
and the old seal did not leak!
