Refer to the picture on page 14 of the Haynes Manual ("Introductory
pages-Jacking and Towing")
I believe what you are referring to are the "lifting points" which are
commonly used for a workshop hoist - and, they also can be used with a
floor jack, although you will only be lifting one wheel at a time, whereas
the jackport (under the centerline of the door, which also happens to be
the center of gravity for the vehicle) will lift the entire side of the car
at one time.  You can use jack stands under the torsion tubes at the rear
(best with some kind of padding).  Some people use the A-arms in front to
support the car on jack stands (here, again, with some type of padding).
