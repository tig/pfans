 G'Day Hansman,

Sounds all too easy!!!! But we have a 45% import duty and any vehicle in 
Australia has to conform to our own unique set of design rules; plus we 
need the steering wheel on the other side! In reality there are a few LHD 
cars but they can't be used easily day to day, so most are converted to 
RHD. 

Typically converted cars are not popular unless performed to factory spec.

Unfortunately a lot of loop holes were closed years ago, otherwise I'd be 
shopping in the US.
