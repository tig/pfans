I have been reading the often humorous letters about police harrasment.
While all posters have valid gripes, you may want to count your blessings.
I do own a Porsche, and have been stopped for completly BS issues, but in no
way does it compare to my sportbike.

Since March (springtime here in Idaho), I have been stopped 14 times and
recieved zero citations.  Reasons given to me for the stops have been
varied, failure to signal lane changes, safety inspections, speeding,
excessive acceleration, and it "sounded" like I was going too fast (boy the
cop got an earfull from me when he said that).

I am actually a very "sane" driver (in populated areas anyway), but my bike
just screams for tickets.  In every instance mentioned above the officer was
completely false.  Here in Boise the police have what seems to be as a
vendetta againsed sportbikes (luckily not Porsche's too).  We have the
highest concentration of sportbikes in the country.  We have even been
harrased eating at a drive in where a cop will pull in and start asking for
our ID's and registration, then run full checks on us and our bikes.

So, I do believe that Porsches are picked on, but if you want to really get
harrased, ride a bullet bike.
