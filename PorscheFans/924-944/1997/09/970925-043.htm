Throttle switch (TPS)...I'll bet money on it. My car had identical symptoms
which only showed up once the car was very thoroughly warmed up--usually
when restarting after sitting for a while because of heat soak. I also had
the problem in stop-and-go traffic, i.e., the car is fine until I'm in
traffic for 10-15 minutes and there's no airflow to reduce underhood
temperatures.

To verify that it's your TPS, pop the hood next time you come to a stop and
the idle is too high. Tap on the TPS (square black box on throttle body)
with a screwdriver or wrench; if the idle drops to normal, you've found
your problem. When I was first diagnosing the problem on my car several
other Pfans listmembers shared similar experiences with me.

Replacements run $50-75 bucks. I bought mine from Sonnen Porsche only
because they're local, and offer a PCA discount. They didn't have it in
stock, though, and PCNA's Western warehouse was also out. I waited four
weeks for it to arrive from der Fatherland. Auto Atlanta has them much
cheaper anyway.

As annoying as the high idle problem was, the stuck-open TPS actually made
it easier to drive the car under very light throttle in first gear...like
when I'm crawling across the Golden Gate Bridge weekday mornings. I got so
used to the throttle action that driving the car after replacing the switch
required some adjustment.

Good luck,
