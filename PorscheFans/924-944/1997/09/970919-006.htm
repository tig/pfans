These lamps... I wouldn't get them unless you find a design that is
specifically set-up for your car, and I doubt that this can be found... 
You would probably need, 2 high voltage transformers that you need to
find a mounting place for, RF shielding (these things are incredibly RF
noisy), and the light output will probably not be as good as an H4 setup
with 100 watt bulbs.

>These are quartz-discharge headlamps (as fitted to new Porsches, and
some Mercedes, Lincoln, and BMW, among others). They are easily
distinguished by their distinct blue tinge (as opposed to the yellow
tinge
of halogens and incandescents. From what I understand by reading a
trade magazine (about the Lincoln), the system consists of more than
just a headlamp unit: there's some special components in there including
some kind of special power supply like a transformer - I think the
lights
work on AC, 
I think it would be simpler to just get projector-type driving lights
with the
prismatic lenses.
