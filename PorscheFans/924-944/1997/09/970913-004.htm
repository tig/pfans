PFans:

        Hi! I just joined this list today. I am a 911 owner in HOT Southwest
Florida and I realize that I need to put my 911 away during the hottest
summer months. I was hoping to purchase a car that was not outrageously
expensive to use during these summer months. I was hoping to look at
1985.5-1987 944's as I like the way they look and assume they are fun to
drive. A friend has told me that the ac in a 944 is no better than that of a
911 despite the fact that the cars are water cooled. Is this true? I do not
want to buy an American car although everyone seems to acknowledge they have
excellent ac. Unfortunately I believe that is frequently all that is
excellent about them. Any suggestions along this line would be greatly
appreciated.
