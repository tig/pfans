RATS!@^*@

After two months, the shut-down problem is back.  I'm going to take the
vaccuum lines apart again this weekend and check electrical connectors
again.  My hope is that, since I got the car wet yesterday, which
doesn't usually happen, that this is an electrical or dirt related
problem that is caused because of moisture.  Last time it happened I was
showing off for a 'vette and today it was a Beemer.  Maybe the car just
doesn't feel like playing at its age?  Maybe it doesn't like I-465? 
Maybe I shouldn't have looked at those Trans-Ams yesterday.

sigh

Maybe I need to add those Borg upgrades to the starboard power coupling.

Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit crystal.
