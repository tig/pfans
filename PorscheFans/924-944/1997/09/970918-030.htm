I can get all four of my track tires (225/50 and 245/45 16" on 7 and 8's)
in the back of my 951 with the seat down (the two rear-most sit flat on
the floor; one of the ones towards the front is tipped up on top of the
other). I have a rollbar, and there's still room for the floor jack,
toolbox, cooler and other stuff on top of the tires and behind the
driver and passenger seats. 

I love my 951. It's got to be the most "practical" sports car ever
designed...
