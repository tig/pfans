Hiya pFans,

I have a 78 924 with a new clutch( installed myself ) that needs repainted
and some minor repairs, ie brakes, seats, etc.  I can do the necessary
work myself for about $500-$600.  The car also has the original 8 spoke
alloy wheels including spare that are pictured on the front cover of the
924 haynes manual.  The 924 has 150k miles but the engine purrs and passes
emission testing.  I drive the car to work everyday.
The ? , should I sell the 924 and buy a 1985 944 that needs a clutch and
a catalytic converter with 81k miles and a nice body for $1600?  944
prices for 85 range from 4k to 6k. I can do the repair work myself.

The current prices in Colorado for 78-79 924 range from about $3k for
clean cars to about $1600 for rough ones.  My thinking is the wheels are
almost worth as much as the car because they are in excellent shape. Is
this true?  If so then I could sell the car alone for $1300 and the wheels
for $1000 or combined for $2100.  How would you sell this car?  

Comments....

Thanks,
Robb...

>>>>>robb,
i just fought this battle myself, i wound up not buying the 944 for several
reasons:
1. i wasnt satisfied with the backgroung of the 944 i was looking at.
2. the maintinence cost of the 944 are high, if the car your looking at hasnt
been       ,,,,maintained one failure can really set you back.
3.  as other pfans have told me, if it "needs work" it needs more than you
know  .....about.
4. i procastinated, think it was a "gut" feeling that my head didnt want to
agree with ....at first.
also, if your luck is half as bad as mine it might not be a good idea to bank
on selling your 924 right away, be prepared to own both for awhile just in
case luck turns against you. (i've got a great buick, can sell it for the
life of me). 
anyway,
good luck, be carefull
