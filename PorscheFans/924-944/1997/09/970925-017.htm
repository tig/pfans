Snip...

Hi Nick and P-Fans,

I went by to see my mechanic buddy at the Porsche dealership.  He allowed me
to go through the manuals and technical specifications for the S2 and 968 to
check out the differences between the two.  Essentially the exhaust camshaft
timing is changed by the increase in oil pressure, as the engine RPM's
increase.  He tells me the 968 piece will "bolt on" with at least the
following other items required: valve cover and a device used to defeat the
feature on a cold engine (with its required wiring).  It was not clear at
what temp the unit is activated (controlled by DME).  You would probably
want the 968 chip as well.  The cost _difference_ between the S2 and 968
unit was ~$800.00.  Add the cover, electronic defeat, and other misc parts
with a healthy dose of R&D time to come up with a low estimate.

BUT, the only reason you need the valve cover is because the electrical
device protrudes upwards through it.  Why not leave it off and dead-end it
so that it operates all of the time?  Just drive the car easily (as you
should) until it is up to operating temp.  

Anybody got a spare one hanging around?
