Did anybody watch 48 hours last week?  I caught part of it which was dealing
with "road rage".  The highway patrol had just pulled over a 944 Turbo (I think
an 89' 951S - nice car!!!) for "aggressive driving".  The driver didn't put up
with anything.

Did anyone else see this?  Is this person a member on the list?  I didn't catch
the name but it was someone with an accent.

I liked the comment by the patrolman as he was about to pull over the 951,
something like here's a hotshot in a fancy sportscar (no pre-conceived
sterotyping on the officers part here).

They ended up arresting the guy and hauling him downtown.
