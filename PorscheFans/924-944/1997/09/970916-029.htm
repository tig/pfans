WELL i recently saw someone post a need for someone to help them decide what
type of air compressor to purchase.. I would suggest that you decide how much
$$$ you want to spend first , then that will dictate what type of compressor
you will be able to purchase..  I would definitely recommend Ingersoll-Rand
b/c of some features...their type 30 line of compressors have cast iron
cylinders, splash lubrication, and forged crank..definitely engineered for
the long run..the do however manufacture a less expensive line called their
type 10 line which is an aluminum pump version with cast iron sleeved
cylinders..they are good as well, but not made for industrial type duty...if
you are indeed interested in a compressor give me a call and i can help you
find/figure out what type is best for you ...with the constraints in
mind..i.e.  voltage, acfm needed, $$$ to spend etc... i can be reached @
205-822-5530...ask for Nitin..
