Mike,

Thanks for your info on stock boost level.  I guess the real stock boost =
level is about 0.7 (1.7 on the guage), from the other responses I've =
received.  The only thing I can think of that may have been limiting my =
boost pre-chip was that my stock boost recirculation valve was broke.  =
It's the component that keeps the boost level up when you close the =
throttle between shifts.  I don't think that that should have caused a =
fault, but it's possible.

Anyhow, I replaced the valve, installed the chip, and the boost has been =
healthy ever since (0.9 bar).  I only had the car a short time before =
chipping it, so my memories of the stock boost level could be wrong....

Thanx,

Dean
'87 951 - almost 56K miles - love that 'whoosh' sound

I'm pretty sure my car was very healthy before the chip upgrade, so I =
think
it's true that the stock '86-'87 models had very mild boost levels.

I'm no expert but my '87 went to about 1.7 on the stock guage before I
chipped it. Afterward (briefly, but that's another story) it went to =
about
1.9.
