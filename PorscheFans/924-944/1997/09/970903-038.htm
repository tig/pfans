Having come back from Europe and beginning to understand the differences
in prices between countries, I'm curious as to what it costs for the most
basic running of your p-car.  I can see why people may get upset when
they hear that 16 year olds are driving 944 Turbos around here, especially
for those in the world who may pay upwards of US$40k to own an 89 944 Turbo
because of import taxes/road taxes.  So, in order to further understand,
I pledge that we give out our basic running costs of our cars.  These would
include:

1. location from where you are typing
2. year and model of car and purchase price in US dollars
3. cost of 1US galon of gas in US dollars
4. cost of 1yr's insurance at basic rate (the rate you'd pay if you didn't
   have any safe driver's discount)
5. general hourly labour rate at nearest Porsche shop (dealer or private)

I think this could be very interesting, but if someone has already answered
and the numbers are similar, don't bother to take up the extra bandwidth,
unless it's a completely different area of the world.  I'm especially 
interested in Asian and European owned cars.

I'll start:
1. B.C. Canada
2. 1989 944 Turbo, US$20,000 (purchased in Aug 1996)
3. US$2/gallon (it's C$0.70/litre)
4. US$1800 (age of driver does not matter in B.C. at this time)
5. US$50/hr

I think this will be one of the lower ones.  For those that don't know,
the answers from some of our European neighbours will drop your jaw!

Farzaan.
