I agree with the use of synthetic oil for turbos.  It breaks down at a mu=
ch
higher temperature than dino.

I would question the use of 5w30 even in the winter.  From what I have be=
en
told, the engine manufacturer's recommended weight of oil is based on the=

clearances designed into the engine.  If the book says 20w50 that is the
correct oil for the engine.  A lighter oil will let the pistons slap and
will run out of the rod and main bearings.  As the crank rotates, it is
loading and unloading the various surfaces of the bearings.  If the oil i=
s
not thick enough, it will run out the unloaded side of the bearing thus
reducing oil pressure and the protective oil film layer on the loaded sid=
e.
 Also the oil pump is clearanced for the recommended oil weight.  A light=
er
oil may not have as good a flow rate.  In the case of the 944 that has a
tendency to cavitate in the oil pump at high rpm, a lighter oil is not a
good idea.

The slight increase in hp is valid but with the possibility of increased
engine wear.
