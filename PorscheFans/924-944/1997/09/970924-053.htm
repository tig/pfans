>The only time I experienced significant fade was at Road America where
after about 6 hard laps the brakes showed fade in Canada Corner.  (Not a
good place!)  I use the Ford High Performance brake fluid as it has a
higher dry boiling point than the ATE super blue and since its clear, it'=
s
easy to see if the fluid has become dirty or if there are bubbles in the
line(s).  The Ford fluid is also less than half the price of the ATE so =

it's cheap to change the fluid before every event.  Probably not necessar=
y,
but makes me feel good.

If you have the M030 sport suspension you already have the big front roto=
rs
and calipers.  If not you're still fine.  The brakes on this car are grea=
t.
 Have fun!

Michael,

Can you give the list a part # for the Ford brake fluid.  I received a Fo=
rd
part number from another racer.  I called the Ford dealer and was informe=
d
that # had been replaced by another.  When I inquired what the DOT rating=

was, he told me it was DOT 3.  I know the Ford fluid is being used with
good success and that it is like DOT 5 in performance.

Jim Richmond
