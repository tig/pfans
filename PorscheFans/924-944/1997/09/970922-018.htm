Terry --

Hope you don't mind if I post this to P-Fans too, in case anyone else wants
the info, or has more info/opinions on supercharging.

>Hi Nick:  thanks for the note.  First of all, I haven't bought the car yet.
> I used to have a 1985.5 944, though, and understand I'll need to use a
>85.5-87 car exclusively.  I'm looking at a couple of appropriate candidates.

Right. You need the lower 9.5:1 compression ratio AND a removeable chip.

>My questions:
>
>1.  Is the kit of high quality?  Are they good to deal with? 

The kit is high quality. All the parts fit pretty well, but you may have to
drill a new mounting hole in the idler pulley so that it is wedged snugly
so there's so chance of it moving and dropping tension.  This pulley can
also be a pain to shim so that all the pulleys on the main drive belt are
flush. Use a straight-end to make sure they're all lined up. And watch out
for that belt! It's location at the top puts it very close to a coolant
hose. I sawed thru one 10 miles out of town. Not fun. Secure the hose out
of danger.

I'm not sure the Paxton supercharger is the best choice. It's heavy (about
25-30 lb) and very difficult to turn by hand. There must be a lighter one
with less inertia that would work.

Toughest part of the job is installing the SC-to-throttle body hose. It's a
tight fit, and compresses sensor leads, and can require bending part of the
throttle linkage plate. Also, be careful when expanding the bottom belt
tensioner.  If the appropriate bolts aren't loosened slightly, it's easy to
crack mounting brackets on the AC compressor and alternator.

Be warned that the Paxton SC has a loud whine that can be embarassing
tooling around town. Some folks love the sound. I didn't.

I dealt w/ the previous operation, German Auto, and they were great to deal
with. Don't know who's running Supercharging of Knoxville. You'll have to
get a sense of their integrity.
 
>2.  Does it work well as advertised without extensive dialing in work?

The only dialing in you should have to do it setting the fuel pressure
level to the right psi under load at specific boost and rpm. This requires
taping a fuel pressure gauge to the windshield and watching it while you
drive. So you need a gauge and a long pressure line. Adjust the fuel
pressure regulator (a good one, part of the kit, and in series with the
stock regulator) accordingly.

>3.  How does a supercharged car compare with a 944 turbo (if you've compared
>them)?

I can only tell you about the SC on my previous late '85. I was interested
in low-end torque and top-end. The torque was there, but the top-end was
not as good as expected. It did not have the performance of my S2, which
accelerates easily to 130 mph and climbs to 145-150. My SCed late '85 did
about 130 mph (sometimes). But it did climb steep grades at 100 mph much
better than stock. On a high-speed run, I finally blew a head gasket on
this car, and scored the cylinder walls.  Beware. Late '85s don't have
knock sensors, and predetonation is hard to hear at speed. You don't know
what's happening in the chambers, and the DME can't correct any problems.
The strategy used in the SC kit is to retard timing across the rpms.

Bottom line before buying this kit is that you should rebuild the engine
before installing it. That's what German Auto did for their track car, and
it's what they seriously recommended to me. In fact, they wouldn't sell me
the kit until I checked the health of my engine. My late '85 had 60K mile,
a reasonable compression and decent leak-down results.  Nonetheless, the SC
managed to push oil out of several sites, including the cam cover gaskets
and the intake manifold/cam cover gaskets (must have had bad guides and
seals). And it burned oil like a well-worn 911. The head should have been
rebuilt before I installed the SC. You're only running about 6 lbs boost
with this kit, but the pressure will find any weak points.

>4.  Will the standard 944 brakes, suspension, and gearbox be up to the added
>power.  I can see a situation where I'll need to upgrade the brakes to turbo
>specs, and by thew time that's done, it'll be nearly as much as a turbo.

Don't think this SC kit requires upgrading anything else. Think the hp I
got must have been around 200-210 hp, and it never showed the performance
of my S2.  Supercharging of Knoxville is probably not over-estimating the
power gain. The engine I used was not in the best shape. On the other hand,
the Turbo upgrades are certainly desireable for the track.  

My recommendation is that you get a 951 or an S2 before you try to build a
better 944 than Porsche. Probably cost about the same. Figure you pay a low
$6K for a good '85.5-'87 944. Then you rebuild the head (ideally the whole
engine) for $500-2000.  Then you buy the SC kit for about $4K. If you don't
get the intercooler, at least get the oil cooler for the SC. That thing
gets really hot. By then, you're in the price range of a good non-S 951 or
a cheap S2.

Exactly my reasons for getting the SC. Drove about 7 951s and didn't like
the lag.  Could be less than optimal for autocross, but you could learn to
use the turbo on the track. The SC does provide good low-end grunt. But so
does the S2.  In theory, the SC sounds great, but it's not as easy to play
around w/ the 2.5 liter and get good results as it might seem. I should
mention that when I was tested the kit, I also had a cat-bypass and
aftermarket cat-back exhaust installed.

I'm pretty sure that if I'd prepped the engine first, and then further
optimized the whole system later, the SC would be a good package.  But I
don't know. The (relatively) high-compression/low-boost approach has
limitations.

Another point is competition classification. If your're serious about solo
racing, check the rules of your club. Think that PCA would automatically
put a supercharged 944 in the top modified class. And you'd only have the
power of a non-S 951 unless you got very serious and organized about going
all the way with the SC route = more boost and a modified, strengthened
engine. 

I should also add that someone who tracked a Paxton-charged 944 told me
that he broke a couple of Paxtons instead of blowing up the engine.

Hope this helps. Don't want to sound entirely negative, but be aware of
what you're getting into.
