To all '81 and '82 931 owners:

I am trying to buy a new engine harness for my '82, but the one my car 
has is not the one that I got in the mail.  I have been told by two of 
the biggest dealers in the nation and Porsche Parts that the one they 
sent me is correct.

I found out the other day that some of the problems with my car are 
the result of a bad rebuild after the car was stolen and blown up 
(hah, so much for finding out the history).  Maybe some weird 
substitution was used.  Besides, my harness looks less like wire and 
more like a dried up octopus on the beach.

At any rate, if you guys are under your hoods soon, look at the 
firewall and see if your engine harness has two of those big fat 
white nine pin plugs on the end (one male, one female).  The one they 
keep sending me has one plug, and a smaller throttle position sensor 
plug (from 944).  Mine has two plugs and a bigger tps plug-my tps 
looks like the 944's but is bigger. 

Thanks for your help-

Dave
