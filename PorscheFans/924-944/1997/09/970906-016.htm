Warning....... this is a bit of saga......

I've got a '86 951 (105KMiles) which has recently aquired a vibration which, after 
driving 50 miles or so makes my hands and legs start to go numb.....

It's recently had new front tyres which where Goodyear F1s which have been 
a real problem to balance.  I thought that this was the problem and have got the 
garage to swop them for a set of RE71 Bridgestones.  The wheelbalance type problem has
gone but the underlying vibration remains.  

I then took it back to the supplying garage (the car is still under warrenty).  They diagnosed 
that one of the engine mounts had started to collapse and they have changed it FOC.  The majority
of the vibration is still there and the garage are now saying that I have to except it because of the 
age of the car......... I'm not happy with that response.


Does anybody have any idea what could be causing this ?

It appears to be speed related and not engine rev related.  It effects the steering wheel, pedals
dashboard, gear change etc.
