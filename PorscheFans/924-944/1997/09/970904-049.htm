There is a number of people on the list (including me!) that somehow
seem to have the need for mouthing opinions at every opportunity. But if
you are flamed for being a 3M employee, and mentioning 3M products, that
is way uncool. 

But OTOH, a guy from 3M would be expected to stick to it, and be able to
solve things, wouldn't he... He may also be less expected to crack under
pressure and generally keep things together...

Again, Mark, this is not a problem, and do continue to tell us about
useful stuff.
Thank you for sharing a bit of professional advice!

PS: Mark, 3M would not have any suitable flameproofing spray - I might
need it anytime soon... for those bad,bad puns...  (just kidding...)
