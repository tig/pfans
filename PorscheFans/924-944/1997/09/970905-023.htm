>They weren't a drop-in. This was the "plate" version, rectangular in
shape. They were mounted horizontally, and extended slightly forward from
the original hole, as opposed to the vertical mounting of the factory
ovals. A small portion of the factory speaker grill was retained to cover
the hole above the ADS as mounted.

>>Wow 7". Did you just cut holes in the floor carpet cover or? Did you DIY?
>>Was the system sold with the car? TIA
>************************
>Yes, the subs were mounted by cutting circular holes in the rear deck
carpet (and the masonite stiffeners that cover the small compartments
behind the rear wheels). The system was installed by a local free-lancer
who did a very nice job. It was sold with the car.......to my wife's boss,
yet! How's that for confidence in a used car?
