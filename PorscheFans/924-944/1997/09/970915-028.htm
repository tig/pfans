Howdy guys,

Hope you had a good, safe weekend.  We did not.  The weekend was coming along
well with Kart racing on friday night and kart racing on Saturday during the
day (we are getting karts to go pro racing for next year so we are practicing
as much as possible).  At night, we were helping a friend set up for a Rave
party.  At the Rave party, we got the page.  It was the Police saying that
Paul's younger brother had been involved in an accident and to come to the
hospital.  Damn.

Luckily, Mark was alright, just a few cuts on his hands and a sore back and
neck the next day.  The car on the other hand is 100% written off.  There
is no way they will fix that car, so scratch one 87 944 Turbo from the
944T population.  The pole squished the passenger seat to the point where
there was about 5-6" between the two bolsters, but remarkably, the door
skin did not come apart and the door itself didn't even lose any paint,
just turned into a perfect half-circle.

I'm not a traffic engineer, so I won't speculate on who or what was at fault,
but the weather conditions were horrible (first downpour after a dry spell
with all the oils on the road and it was just pouring rain) and it was the
young lad's first time out in that car in the rain.  I take full responsibility
for not forcing him to go to an auto-x or two before driving the car on the road.  I hope that he gets another 944T, this time, I will personally ensure
that he takes the proper lessons on car control and what happens after a loss
of car control to make him a better road driver.

So, why am I telling you this?  Just to remind you and myself that we are
just human beings, we are not indestructable, mistakes happen, accidents
happen.  Also, for the new 944T drivers in this group, (and I say this to all
ages) be cautious in the rain, especially if you have stock chips as the
boost does come on quite hard at 4000rpm and a loss of traction in wet
conditions is not hard to come by in that range.

To make matters worse, Paul, myself and Mark were not able to go to bed
until 5:00am on Saturday night.  Sunday was the 2nd last race of the year
for the series points.  I did not attend it as I would have been too tired,
but my competition did not show either!  I actually was allowed to show
up in the afternoon and make my runs, but I don't consider that to be
fair to my competition.  I would have locked up 2nd place for the year
behind the 911TT.  With only one event to go, the other guys wouldn't have
had a chance to get around me.  Even if I had gone, I don't think I would
have run in class, it's no fun winning because no one showed up, and the
other two are quite serious and rely on sponsorship money to race.  I don't
think their sponsors would be happy with me on my street tires beating them
in the year-end results with them on their R1's.

I've been told that they will be showing up for the last event next weekend
so I will go and try to at least take 3rd place away from one of them,
fair and square :)

BTW - speed wasn't a factor in the above accident, the gear shifter
      was jammed in 2nd so he couldn't have been going that fast.

Drive safely,
Farzaan.
