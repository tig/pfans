Hi Pfans,
I wanted to say -Thank You- to all who responded about my snap 
ring/thermostat question. They were all very helpful...but in the end, 
without the proper tool I decided to throw in the towel and flatbed the 
car to my mechanic. I know all you shadetree mechanics are shaking your 
heads in disbelieve...but I am self-employed and time is money, and 
after spending a full work day buying/borrowing various snap ring pliers 
with no success, I was wasting more money than I was saving.

On a positive note...I DID manage to install my alternator cooling hose, 
and found it to be relatively easy. The key to doing any maintenance on 
these cars are having the right tool(s) for the job. In the case of the 
snap ring pliers, I did not have the proper Snap-On tool. In the case of 
the alternator cooling hose, I happen to have a very handy ratcheting 
screwdriver with a pivoting head. Although the space is VERY tight, with 
a long enough screwdriver attachment it was pretty painless.
