<< Any informations/hints regarding the where and how to install it, any
additional parts list, will be greatly appreciated. Also I  understand there
are 2 types of accusump (manual & power) any preference? >>

Canton Racing Products, (203) 484-4900, sells the Accusump in one, two and
three quart sizes.  I purchased the two quart electric unit #24-024 for
$275.00  Mounting brackets #24-200 are an additional 17.50.  The manual valve
must be in a location that is accessable from the driver's seat -- not
practical unless the car is stripped for racing.  The solenoid actuated valve
permits oil flow into the tank when de-energized but only allows flow to the
engine when energized.  

To use as a pre-oiler, the valve is energized before starting the engine and
then de-energized.  The tank will refill as the car is driven, obtaining the
highest oil pressure that is achieved while driving.  To use as a backup oil
supply while racing, the valve would be opened while driving so that engine
oil pressure would balance with tank pressure to maintain the oil volume in
the tank, ready to supply oil if the sump pickup tube sucked air.  The valve
would be closed during the cooldown lap the maintain the oil volume in the
tank, ready for the next race.

Tank installation took seven hours.  The tank must be mounted as close to the
engine attachment point as possible.  Since there is NO space available space
anywhere near the engine, I mounted it behind the right front wheel.  Remove
the inner wheelwell and you will see the available space.  

After mounting the clamps at the ends of the tank. I positioned it
vertically, oil end up, as far forward as possible.  Vertically, it was
positined with the top mounting holes one inch up from the center of the
horizontal relief channel in the sheetmetal.

The passenger footwell must be removed, along with side carpet, glovebox and
all of the components that are mounted behind and to the right of the
glovebox.  By marking the desired tank mounting hole locations and measuring
the relationship to the relief areas in the steel, one can transfer the
locations to the inside to drill holes.  The lower holes are a little tricky
as oversized holes must first be drilled in the inner wall of a box channel,
then the mounting holes drilled.  There are large rubber plugs in the inner
box channel wall that can be easily removed to help install washers and nuts
onto the bolts.

In the telephone yellow pages find an Aeroquip fitting supplier.  They are
usually listed in the hydraulic fitting/hose section.  I spent $100 on
fittings and hose.   I will copy the invoices for anyone interested.  E-mail
me for an address to send a SASE.

I attached the hose at the 951 remote oil cooler lower fitting.  The hose
from the oil cooler to the oil filter housing must be removed using 27mm and
32mm wrenches.  The upper hose union was a bear to loosen.  I removed the oil
pressure sending unit, the car tie-down bracket and moved power steering
tubes.  New fittings and a tee were attached at the cooler port.  The hose
shop had removed the lower fitting on the removed oil hose and it was now
sized and cut to length and a new fitting attached at home.  A custom made
elbow was attached to the top of the tee for the accusump and the hose was
routed to the top of the fender.  It fits over the inner wheelwell.

A switch is required to actuate the valve.  The supplied toggle switch can be
mounted under the dashboard.  I chose to purchase a fog lamp switch and place
it in one of the unused center console switch locations.  Wires for optional
switches are already there and I found one that was hot when the ignition
switch was energized.  Since the valve draws only 0.7 amps, the wire gauge
will be fine.  I routed a wire from the normally open position of the switch
around the passenger footwell, through a grommet near the tank mounting holes
and to the solenoid.  The other wire from the solenoid was routed to a good
ground (one mounting bolt).

Instead of 6.9 quarts of oil, the system now requires 8.6 quarts.  With the
tank full and the engine off overnite, energizing the valve produces a
reading of over three on the gauge for most of a minute before it slowly
starts to drop.  this is without installing a check valve in the original oil
circuit to prevent backflow.  I believe that this is because the oil pump has
enough resistance to backflow.

I will be glas to clarify or provide more detail if anyone is interested.
