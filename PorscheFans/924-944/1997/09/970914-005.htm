---------------------------------

Murphy's Laws of 944 ownership =



Section 1, Purchasing:

*       If it is perfect, someting is overlooked.

*       There is yet another fault.

*       A failure will not appear until guarantee is void. =


*       The better alternative emerges only after a deal is closed.

*       Hidden flaws will not stay hidden.


Section 2, Driving:


*       If things feels just right, something bad is bound to happen.

*       If it doesn't feel quite right, that observation is correct.

*       Flavells Finding: Breakdown will happen at the most =

        embarrassing location.

*       Flavells Second Finding: Police speed cameras work.

*       The other Porsche is quicker.

*       Donsbachs Delusion : Subjective acceleration is a direct
        function of how far you have to reach out the side window =

        to see where you're going.

*       A speed related Police situation will immediately go from =

        bad to worse as the Police reads 't-u-r-b-o'.

*       Shooks Constant : Repair bills + Speeding tickets =3D constant

*       Repair bills and speeding tickets don't even out - they add up.
                     =

*       If driving starts to be fun, your girlfriend gets sick.

*       The amount of traveling pleasure derived from both front =

        seats is constant.

*       If it is a nice day for a drive, you get stuck in a traffic jam.

*       Ruudjes Observation of Traffic Intensity: If there wasn't any
        traffic at all, you missed the game of the year.

*       Spencers Theorem : If there is a beautiful, twisty stretch of
        road ahead, there will also be Winnebagos.

*       Spencers First Corrolary: If there are not Winnebagos, there
        will be a speed trap.

*       Spencers Second Corrolary: If there are neither Winnebagos or
        speed traps, you will not be driving your 944.


Section 3, Mechanical:

*       A tool will fall in the most inaccessible place...

*       Lichtensteins Addition: ... right on top of the previously
        dropped part.

*       Easy to remove parts will never break.

*       When they break, they will be found to be not so easy to remove

*       The tool you don't have will be needed.

*       If you do own the tool, it will have been lent out to a fellow
        944 owner for the same repair

*       The tool you have will not fit.

*       The tool that fit will break.

*       No relevant bolt can be reached.

*       Leens Non-Observation: The most critical bolts cannot even =

        be seen. =


*       Menelaos Corollary to the rule of unreachable bolts: There is,
        however, no bolt a 2yr old's arm cannot reach.

*       The First Parental Addition: 2yr old's are surprisingly adept
        with tools.

*       The Second Parental Addition: There will still be no room =

        for a adult arm.

*       Leens Flamin' Rule: The rag you put under the filter to catch
        drips will, if forgotten, touch the exhaust manifold, at which
        time it will ignite.

*       Trip odometer cannot be reset while driving. =

        If it is anyway, it cannot be reset at all. =


*       Spinning - tires won't, clutch will... =


*       If the clutch copes, the CV joints won't  =


Section 4, Service, workshops and mishaps:

*       Odometers register miles faster close to a big service. =


*       But not as fast as afterwards.

*       An unwary owner may damage things, but to =

        make a complete mess you need a Porsche dealer.          =


*       Leens Rephrase: Owners screw things up by virtue of ignorance,
        dealer/mechanics will screw things up out of neglect. =


*       A flat will happen when the luggage area is occupied.

*       If there is a flat tyre, the air pump was kept by the =

        previous owner.    =


*       If the previous owner left the air pump with the car, it =

        will not work.

*       If the air pump is working, the wheel lock key will be at home.

*       Vaughans observation: The wheel lock key, if present, will be
        found only after the lock has been drilled out. =


*       Availability of a upgraded part will not be noticed until =

        the part is already replaced

*       Svenssons Predictive Postulate: If you say to the boss that =

        you were late because you had a flat, this will be true.
        Tomorrow.     =


*       It is a mistake to allow any mechanical object to realize =

        that you are in a hurry.

*       DME Fault Finding is a systematic method of coming to the =

        wrong conclusion with confidence.

*       Ferry's Law of Porsche Costs and Schedules: Everything costs
        more and takes longer.
 =

*       944 Bonnet Rule: What goes up, will come down. Then, it
hurts.      =

*       If a 1 dollar part need to be replaced, it is located inside =

        of at least 150 dollars worth of gaskets.

*       Leens Observations on Porsche Locks

        If you have a Cabrio, you will be able to lock your keys in =

        the trunk.  =

        On holiday weekends, the locksmith charges double for making
        calls.  =

        Some locksmiths charge triple for Porsche's.  =

        If your Porsche is really hard to break into, the locksmith =

        will charge by the minute.

        =

Section 5, Miscellaneous


*       If you forget your sunroof open, it will rain at night.

*       If it is removed, it will rain more.

*       Lichtensteins Law of Deluge: If you really close it up, =

        there will be a flood.

*       If there is a nicer 944, it will park beside you.

*       If there is a rust-bucket, it will park even closer.

*       Karamichalis Directional Law : Any Porsche will have its =

        engine forward relative its direction of travel. =


*       Karlsen's observations on water leaks:
        Waterproof Porsches aren't.     =

        The leak you fixed last week will reemerge in another, more
        difficult to find, location. The leak you fix this week will
        make the leak you fixed last week reappear and multiply.
        There is always another leak.
        Two leaks do not even out, they add upp.
        What comes in will not go out. =


Section 6, Cosmetics


*       Leen=92s Law of Orbital Motion: If there is a orbital sander,
        there will also be a grit particle.

*       Quantificational Statement to Leens Law: It takes just one
	grit particle if there is a orbital sander.

*       New paint doesn't quite match.

*       Washing the car will create rain.

*       Sharpes Law of Attraction: Birds just drop when they see a
        freshly waxed Porsche.
