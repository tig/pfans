The chip's (there were 2 on my 86 951) are under the passenger side
floorboard just peel the carpet back and you will see a wood, yes wood
backing plate. This is held in position by 4 screws (1 in each corner)
remove the backing plate & you will see a silver metal box. The box is
not screwed together, it has little tangs, bend them until they are
straight, and slide the back off. At first glance you will not see any
chips, however they are sandwiched between 2
circuit boards. These boards have several plastic pins, you need to
squeeze them together and gently pry the boards apart Note: they only
can be pried using the ribbon cable as a hinge. replace the chips. 
This procedure is fairly easy and it took me about 2 hours. I however
had the luxury of being familiar with circuit  boards. HANDLE WITH CARE.

Good luck
