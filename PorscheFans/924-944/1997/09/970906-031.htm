        well i am in the process of diasembling the rear end to find my
problem (one hub rotates, the other does nothing)the first question is do i
NEED to take the CV joint off or can they stay to connected?  the second
question is anyone in the Waco, TX area that knows more about this type
problem than do i?  I have learned alot from my car and i am ready to tackle
any job but besides a 65 stand i have no experience with tearing a car
apart.  if anyone is interested in helping i can provide lodging (nice apt.
many college girls around!!), food, and maybe even LOADS of beer (no
driving, of course).  if anyone on the list can even tell me where to begin
and what to take apart because i cannot even find the repair in the haynes
manual, (it is very vague on trans work).

thanks again guys and gals and this really is the best resource for these cars!,

matt
