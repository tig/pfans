Hello Dave,

your are right the...
cars from '80 had an Audi based turbocharged engine...
For the engine ....
means the first Production 944 engine ... I mean it is ... a half V8 928
engine.
I have written it a bit unclear, Sorry.

Bye Michael

>>Hello Richard,

>>Well the 944 Prototyp for Bodywork and Spoiler was the 924 Carrera GT

>>presented at IAA '79.
>>Porsche runs with these 924 Carrera GT at Le Mans '80 with a 3 Car-
>Team.
>>
>>>For the engine they used the half 928 V8 engine, because they were
>>unhappy with the modified Audi engine and much more with the 924 
>Turbo engine.

>Eh? I don't think they used anything other than the two-litre Audi (

>If I remember correctly, even the GTR used an Audi block, albeit with
