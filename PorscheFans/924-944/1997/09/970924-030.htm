Well Fans,
I said I would keep you posted about the tests of the radar jammers we
ordered.  Unfortuately, the order was placed just before the UPS strike and
so I waited, and waited... however, they had said 4-6 weeks delivery.
Finally after 6 weeks, I contacted the company Jammers, Inc. and asked where
were my jammers.  They told me the FCC had shut them down for transmitting
way  more than the allowed 5 mW of power.  They said they are working on
alternatives and would be sending a letter and refunding the charges.
Therefore no tests to report.  I am still looking for an alternative.  I
will let you know of any developments.
