Okay, I'm groveling now.   Please, please can someone tell me where the 
OEM horns are located on 88 951.  I've received no response and am 
actually starting to think that I may not have any installed.  PO mounted air 
horns but I'd like to go back to stock.  With the engine compartment as 
cramped as it is, I may still be just not seeing them.

p.s. What idjit designed the license plate light assembly which uses 
5.5mm self-locking nuts on the inside and soft, painted over phillips 
screws on the outside.  1/8 turn, 1/8 turn, 1/8 turn, aiiiy!  At least it was a 
good thing I bought the BIG wrench kit at Sears so I had a 5.5mm 
wrench.
