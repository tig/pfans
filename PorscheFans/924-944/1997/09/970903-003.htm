I had a similar problem for some time on my 85.5 with at around 100 k
miles.
I also used Castrol 20-50 GTX and the lifter started ticking after (you
guessd it!) the internal cooler seals failed. These cars are certainly
engeneered, as they seem to share virtues as well as weak point to such
amazing degree...  

I changed to Mobil One synthetic before schedule, and that seemed to
solve that little problem. In a mysterious way, the lifter gradually
stopped ticking in about 1200 miles or so. It still gives evidence of
leaking a little, as it makes itself heard when I start the car after it
has been sitting for a week or so but is not ticking at all when the
engine is running.

It could be an effect of just some new clean oil as well as a effect of
the syntheticks reputed better cleansing propertys. I can't really know
that, but I did not see any new leaks or other problems that synthetic
oil folklore is telling us about. 

Do not dilute lubricating oil with diesel. Thats an archaic procedure
and will do your engine no good at all.
