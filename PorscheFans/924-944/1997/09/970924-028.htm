>==================================
Nick - the 951S is also in class P9 (86-88 non S turbos are, I believe, in
class P8).  From what I can remember about the last several Porsche Parade
autocrosses, I don't believe a 968 has ever won, whereas the 944S2 is
usually the top performer (except this year when Jason Burkett of Paragon
Products took top honors).  This year in San Antonio, there were no S2's
running in P9.  Remember, in a short autocross format, smooth is fast, not
necessarily raw power.
