Alyn, I have been doing my own tensioning for the last 10 years.  I'm not
surprised your dealer tries to scare you into not doing it; this is
probably one of thier 'bread & butter" jobs.  Please see the following
note(s) I've posted to other list members.


Joe, the following note was my response to a non-mechanically minded person
on this list who did not recommend changing belts one's self.  As far as
the tool cost, I have seen very little variation in the price (always
around $370 in various Panorama advertisers).  You may also need to modify
an open end tappet (thin body) wrench to get to and hold the tensioning
roller while you tighten the lock nut.  I bought one from Sears; had to
file it a bit to fit the nut (it was not metric) and then heat to red hot
with a propane torch at the appropriate bend locations (held in a vice) and
bend into an 'S' shape (you will see why when you get in there).  If you
happen to break it in the process don't worry.  Just stroll back into Sears
and say you want a free replacement.  Can't beat that Craftsman guarantee! 


"While Richard's comments may make sense for the 'mechanically
non-inclined'
on the list, I must disagree with his analysis.  I have owned my car for 10
years and have been changing/adjusting those belts all of that time.  The
expensive tool has MORE THAN paid for itself thank you.  In my opinion,
those of you with the mechanical inclination (and tools) should be
encouraged to do jobs such as this.  If you plan to own your 944 for the
long run, that is."
