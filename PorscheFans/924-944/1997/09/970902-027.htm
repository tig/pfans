 Hi, bob,

Since you must have the motor out of the car to attempt this repair, I =
offer my method (?)...

1) Lock the camshaft in place with the 1 1/8 box end wrench =
(probably30mm or so)  deep offset, I got mine
at my local sino/hindi tools place for about $8 and have got my money's =
worth out of it...

2) Using the Ingersoll-Rand 1/2 inch drive impact wrench and 13 mm deep =
socket over the lisle 10mm=20
triple square tool, make sure that you have it set to undo and hit it =
once, sharply!

3) If/when that fails, use a 3/8 drill bit to drill out the head until =
the head pops off. With the tension gone, the bolt
shaft comes out easily... No need to use any penetrati8ng oil. The real =
problem seems to be the shallowness of
the triple square area...

4)  P.S. don't even consider this without a spare camshaft bolt in =
hand...

Good Luck!
