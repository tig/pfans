OK, update on the 944S making a god-awful rapping under certain load 
conditions in the 2400-4400 RPM range.

I've got the camshaft cover off, and sure enough, there's scrape marks on it 
from where the timing chain is hitting the inside of the cover. It is striking 
directly in the center of the cover, above the tensioner shoe, and again on 
the inner rib that is created by the word "PORSCHE" being molded on the outer 
face of the cover.  The cover gasket is a bit thicker than stock, as the first 
shop tried this to alleviate the rubbing, to no avail.

There is NO discernable slack in the chain, it is VERY taut, and the tensioner 
is fully extended and VERY springy when I push down on it, leaving a good 
impression in my palm.  I cannot discern any excessive wear on the cam 
sprockets that would lead to excessive chain slack and therefore excessive 
tensioner travel, but I would not be the best judge with this being my first 
look under the cover(s).  The tensioner and lines appear to be in very good 
shape (they and the chain are brand new).  The banjo bolts were tight, the 
sealing rings were in place, and the line and oil delivery channel is clear.

I have removed the oil pressure reducing valve and its set screw, and will be 
replacing them with new ones shortly (based on a Porsche tech. bulletin re: 
lifter noise).

The tensioner as extended creates a bow in the chain, and I do not know how 
far this would extend as standard.  Still, having looked at everything under 
the cover, I am at a loss as to what could make the chain travel THAT far to 
hit the inside of the cover.  I have taken some measurements, (and made some 
key assumptions), on the clearances that exist between chain and cover.

Following are some poor man's drawings of the clearances I could measure with 
the engine off.  First, I cut a piece of straight cardboard so that it would 
rest on the edges of the camshaft housing but "reach" over the cams.  It 
looked something like this:

      ________________________________________
     |                                        |
     |     ______________________________     |
     |    /                              \    |
     |   /                                \   |
     |__/                                  \__|


Then, I placed it on the camshaft housing, and used a penknife to scribe the 
profile of the chain against the cardboard.  By placing the cardboard on a 
level surface and using a Starret scale, I came as close as I can to measuring 
how far the chain extends above the camshaft housing's edge.  The profile 
looked something like:

                       _____
       ___------=======     =======------___
     -=                                     =-

The maximum point was 1 5/8" above the camshaft housing's edge, and about 1 
3/8" at the point where the internal rib is over the chain.

I then made the same measurements on the camshaft cover, using the Starrett 
scale to measure how "deep" the cover was, with the gasket still on it, of 
course.  I tried compressing the gasket as much as I could, to approximate the 
fact that it would be torqued down.  The center of the cover is about 1 27/32" 
deep, and the rib is 1 9/16".  That leaves clearances of 7/32" in the center, 
and 3/16" at the rib.  It's not a heck of a lot of clearance, and consider 
that my measurements aren't perfect, but it IS clearance.  With the engine 
off.  There ain't no clearance obviously with the cover on.

Recall that this noise started with no prior warning, and immediately after 
ZUNZ was added to the coolant to help plug a head gasket leak.  How ZUNZ would 
affect the oil system from the coolant system is your best guess as well as 
mine.  (The car has no coolant/oil mixing, as that was repaired under the 
Porsche recall campaign a long time ago).

So I have two guesses from local shops (ie. sprocket wear and the oil pressure 
reducing valve), and some great advice from the list (especially Dave Cooley, 
thanks Dave!), but am still looking for possibilities.  Any ideas and/or 
suggestions are greatly appreciated.
