Fenders 101, Roll Your Own

Here is the "procedure" used on lesser cars with good results.  Materials=

list:  1 1/4 or 1 1/2" diameter x two to three foot steel pipe, assortmen=
t
of local lard butts and a trustworthy driver or pipe holder.  Place the
pipe on the approx. ten o'clock position of the the rear tire holding it =
at
a 45 degree angle.   Open your rear hatch and load with lard butts until
the rear fender well is down over the edge of the tire and almost touches=

the pipe.  Drive the car forward (slowly) while exerting upward pressure =
on
the pipe.  =


You can usually roll the lip in one pass without cracking the paint.  Try=

it on your neighbor's Beemer first to get some practice.
