HI!-

My suspicion, which is not really founded on anything other than a similar 
experience with a fairly new Pontiac "Firechicken" owned by a friend, is 
that you may have oxygen  sensor "issues" to deal with.   When we read 
trouble codes on his car, which had symptoms identical to what you've 
described, it spat out "O2 sensor fault"; we replaced it and his "car" felt 
all better.  Basically what happened, in theory, was as soon as the O2 
sensor got near operating temperature, it shorted or read full scale (I know 
not which) and presumably the GM computer decided to go on vacation until it 
got a better reading from that sensor (after the sensor had cooled).

I would hope the all knowing DME would sense such a grandiose sensor fault 
and discount (ignore) it, but maybe not.

A side note: I haven't yet got the manual fiche for my "new" 88 944S, but I 
am curious:  is it new enough that it will blink trouble codes through the 
dash without special tools? or do I need to go buy more stuff? or can it 
even be done??

This is in response to:
