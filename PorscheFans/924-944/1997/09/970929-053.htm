Looking for a used 944 Turbo?
by Mike Kehr, Shattenbaum Region

In case you're looking for a used 944 Turbo (951) but are unsure of the
various model-year differences, here is a thumbnail sketch of the car from
1986 through 1989.

The 944 Turbo was first introduced in this country as an 1986 model. Some
cars with early VIN numbers had problems with cracking exhaust manifolds
and a leaky fuel line coupling. An improvement in the exhaust system was
made in '87 involving a change in the crossover pipe, which takes off 5
hours of labor when changing the clutch, and a redesigned water pump and
motor mounts. The fuel line problem was part of Porsche's recall campaign.
These problems may have been corrected if the owner took advantage of 
Porsche
Cars North America (PCNA) Campaign notifications made
during the 5-year warranty period (look for documentation).

In 1987, ABS brakes and dual air bags were offered as standard equipment. 
This was 
a first for Porsche, the first U.S imported/domestic car to offer  dual 
airbags as 
standard equipment.  Changes were made to the front wheel geometry to 
accommodate
the ABS,  which changed the wheel offset from 23.3mm to 52.3mm. Various 
corrections to the 1986 model were fitted in this model-year. A 
self-adjusting belt tensioner was also added.

A special, limited edition model, the 944 Turbo S, was produced in 1988 as
a direct result of factory preparations made for the Porsche Turbo Cup 
race
series. This special model, with silver rose metallic paint and matching
plaid burgundy interior, came equipped with 928 S4 brakes, an engine with 
247 bhp,
new vanes in the turbocharger, DME remapping , shaft diameter was 
increased in the exhaust valves, additional reinforcement plates between 
both side members on the right and left sides,  resulted in some minor 
changes to the engine compartment. Minor changes were made to the fender 
areas to accommodate the larger forged club sport wheels (front: 
7J*16/65mm rim offset, rear: 9J*16/60mm offset) and tires (front: 225/50 
VR 16, rear: 245/45 VR 16. The car was loaded with all the options: Sport 
suspension (M 030), stronger manual transmission with oil cooler, 
stronger limited slip differential, and clutch modifications. A special 
VIN was not used for the turbo S, although the transmission and engine 
serial numbers were S designated. The transmission date of manufacture is 
followed by AOR, the engine number will start with 47 J... followed by 
the serial number. The "7" in the prefix number designates the S model. 
The engine type is 44/52.
Approximately 700 cars of this limited edition model were shipped to PCNA.
As demand grew for this turbo S,  additional cars (non-silver rose 
metallic)
 were produced for the U.S market. I am unsure of the total, but my guess 
is no more
then 200 units. The standard (non-S) turbo was also available in 1988 and 
is a great buy; 
many bugs were worked out by this time.

In 1989, the Turbo S model, which was a special edition in 1988, was the
"standard" and only version available for the U.S. This was the last year
of production of the 944 Turbo for the U.S market. The car came in all 
color
combinations and with all options available.

The Turbo S cars of 1988 and 1989 produce almost 65 hp per cylinder(no 
modifications !)
and, as a result, may have a greater need for maintenance or repair, 
especially if
the previous owner used the higher performance potential (drivers tended 
to
run these cars harder). So, expect higher repair bills if you purchase 
this
model. I believe this is the best 944 Turbo, but, as you can see, there 
are
trade-offs. The S models will also demand the highest price of the 
944/944 turbo models.
Regardless of which model-year 944 Turbo you find interesting, I suggest
you obtain a pre-inspection by someone who "knows" these cars. In the 
long run it will be
well worth the effort!

Enjoy and happy turbo hunting!

Mike Kehr
