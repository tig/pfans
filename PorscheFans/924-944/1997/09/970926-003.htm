Mark,
 First Do not drive the car. Set aside some time (you will need it).
Start by disconnecting the air cleaner assembly take off the intercooler
tubes inspect for leaks. The large hose leading to the turbo 
may just be cracked take it off and inspect. If still no problem get a
light in the turbo. Look for any signs of abnormality, oil or worse a
peice of????? To me it just sounds as though the large intake hose
leading to the turbo has a rip in it. As far as the hiss make sure that
you didn't knock off the vaccum line leading to the control box when you
changed the chips. This line controls the knock sensor and is a valuable
asset with more boost.

Good luck
