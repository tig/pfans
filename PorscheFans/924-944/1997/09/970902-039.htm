And you know what, guys and gals, sometimes you don't even have to be
inside a car at all.  PCA/Chicago Region just completed its annual Club
Race this weekend (Labor Day), and I spent 90% of the time up in Timing &
Scoring just watching the cars go by on the long main straight at Road
America.  Group 6 had both a 962 and a 962C (Lights).  What a rush when the
green flag dropped for their race.  On my way to work this morning (3 hour
commute from Plymouth, WI to Chicago because I didn't want to fight the
holiday traffic last night) I just set the cruise control at the legal
limit and let the rest of the world do its thing (and wished "cruise
control" meant that I could climb into the back seat and go to sleep).
