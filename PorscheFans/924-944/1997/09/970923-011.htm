Doug,
     Thanks for the quick response. After replacing the Front End components, 
I had the same local Porsche dealer perform the alignment to the tune of 
~$170. (Earlier this year) Unfortunately, up here in Vermont, Porsches are far 
and few between, but I do like your idea of trying a second set of wheels. 
Anyone on this list anywhere near Burlington Vermont and/or ever wanted to 
visit the area? If you are free of front wheel shimmy, want a place to stay to 
see the foliage and are willing to do a quick wheel swap to help me diagnose 
my front wheel shimmy, let me know!  (My wheels are 8x15 and 7x15 Fuchs, 
different offsets)

Thanks,
       Ezra
