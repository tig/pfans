Subject: Dead Instument Cluster!!!--HELP!

My 86 951 has an intermittent problem with the gauges all
going dead at the same time, this also affects the sun roof operation
and the a/c compressor.  There seems to be no pattern of when it does
this, but it's usually when you turn the key,  The gauges have never
died while driving only on start up.  I have replaced the electrical
part of my ignition switch with a new one, same problem.  I'm an
electronics tech by trade and would suspect a bad ground that feeds all
those areas, but I have no idea where to start. Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanx,

Adam Gutierrez 1986 951, Jacksonville, FL

Dear Adam
    I believe your problem is the X-Terminal/Relay (also called the load
reduction relay). This relay shuts off all power to the accsories when the
ignition key is in cranking/start up position! The relay part number is:
#928-615-111-01, located in the second row from the top of the fuse box,
fourth from the left, position #10. The next time this happens check to see
what else doen't work, ie: wipers, low beams, heater blower, ect... All are
shut off during a crank up/start up. The mechanical portion of the ignition
key could also be starting to stick, not letting the ignition key spring back
to the "on" position! If the ignition key sticks in the "crank" position  the
relay will keep all the accsories off! Use a graphite lube for the ignition
lock cylinder.

     Either the Relay of the ignition key is bad!  
 
                      Good Luck, Dave Jalali
