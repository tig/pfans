Howdy,

As promised, I'm setting up the web site of the Germany trip.  I had
this in my mind when I was travelling so you'll notice that the
overall web site should give you a good feel of what we did and 
hopefully you can enjoy the virtual vacation as much as we enjoyed
the real thing :)

So far, I've only managed to finish the Ruf area.  Go to:
http://www.buschurracing.com/germany and click on the Ruf
storefront.  The site is all pictures so if you are on 14.4,
be forewarned, that coffee break is going to take a bit longer
than you planned :)

WHen you guys see the pics from the 'ring, I think you'll 
really enjoy them, especially the race 944T shots.

I'm so happy with the new camera I bought as you'll see from
the moving pics from the 'ring and Hockenheim that I thought I'd
give a plug to the Cannon Sureshot Z135, a great camera for
a reasonable C$399.00.  As you'll see, it works quite well.

Farzaan.
