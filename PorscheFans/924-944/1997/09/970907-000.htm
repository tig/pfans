I took apart my computers after buying the car to see what chips were in 
it.  My 2 cents.

1) Disconnect the battery.  No, really disconnect the battery.  And put 
something between the battery post and cable because the cable wants to 
sit on the post.  

2) When doing this job, I found it easier to unbolt the crossmember the 
computers mount to and unbolt the computers from it.  That way you can 
take it out, play with it, see what it looks like.  The extra 10 minutes spent 
removing and installing these pieces is probably worth not getting neck 
cramps contorting yourself under there.  Also, I have a thing about 
wriggling around on the carpet when working with electrical components. 
Builds up a nice static charge.  Remember the geek rule "STATIC 
KILLS".

3)  When you take apart the two sides of the computer, be careful with the 
plastic leg connectors.  There is a pin that you press down in the center of 
the connector which gives it enough play to slip through the board.  You 
can leave the cable which connects the two boards in place.  After 
separating the halves, one half will slide out of the connector (bottom?).

4)  Unless you're a certified geek, go down to a computer store and spend 
$5 bucks on a chip puller.  While we never use them, it's pretty easy to 
cut a trace, crack a board or bend the end legs if you're not used to this 
type of job and you use a screwdriver.

5)  In my computer, the boards weren't scrubbed very well after assembly 
and were also a bit dusty (9 years old).  I hosed them down with some 
contact spray.

6)  Take some time putting the tops back on and use needle nose pliers to 
crank the tabs.  You don't want those aluminum shells rattling around for 
the next year until you get around to tightening them down again.

All in all, this is not difficult even for those not familiar with working with 
computers or electronics.  Just take your time and don't force anything.  
Remember that these are EXPENSIVE parts and your car's not going 
anywhere without them :-)
