The rear suspension has a total of three possible adjustments, all set after removing
the drop link to the sway bar on each side:

1. Height - Set with the height adjustment eccentric on the spring plate just
            rear of the torsion bar. Have to loosen the nuts on the 14mm eccentric
            and the normal bolt, each 14mm. Requires a 36mm open-end wrench on the
            head of the eccentric and a 24mm open-end on the normal bolt. Replace
            the lock nuts after a couple of cycles as they will no longer lock.
            Torque to 181 ft-lb when finished.

2. Camber - Set with the eccentric bolt that is one of the three 12mm bolts
            holding the spring plate to the trailing arm. The eccentric bolt
            is also the mount for the sway bar drop link. Requires all three
            12mm bolts to be loosened. Rotating the eccentric causes the trailing
            arm to rotate where it attaches to the spring plate. Replace the lock
            nuts after a couple of cycles. Torque the nut on the eccentric to 66
            ft-lb and the other two bolts to 76 ft-lb when finished.

3. Toe - Set by loosening the 12mm bolts described above and using a special tool
         inserted into the hole located to the rear of the camber eccentric. This
         tool, when rotated, causes the trailing arm to move slightly forward or
         rearward on the spring plate. The special tool is not essential as long
         as you are careful with the motion. Torque as above.

I have no specific comments on your problem other than to check the 12mm bolts
and the holes in the spring plate for crud which may be preventing a complete
range of motion there. The bolts will get quite torn up and the threads can also
hang in the holes, restricting movement. If that is OK I would look for excessive
lowering of the rear which might have the suspension out of its range of adjustment.
I'm assuming that the wheel bearings back there are good and aren't adding slop
to the measurement of toe or camber.

Please let us know what you find.
