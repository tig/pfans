I am in a quandary and need the help of the collective!  I have been 
running Valvoline 20W50 since I have owned the car (1.5 years and 20K 
miles) at the suggestion of the local dealer.  I have no idea what the 2 
POs used.  I am debating the switch to Mobil 1 and need some motivational 
therapy.  I have heard that using Mobil 1 may cause some leaks in the seals 
here and there but I also understand that it is a better oil and will 
prolong the engine and turbo life.  The car uses about 1Q every 500-700 
miles and I suspect valve seals.  Also, there is a terrible chatter that I 
have always chalked up to the injectors but I suppose it could be the 
lifters and I understand Mobil 1 may help that too.  I have never done a 
compression or leak down test and the dealer says that I have a small oil 
leak under the cam housing (with all the power steering fluid under there I 
would be hard pressed to identify oil but there is none on the driveway).

Considering the above are there suggestions, pros or cons?  Will the oil 
make that big a difference?

Thanks!
Mark

     I have recently switched to Mobil 1 synthetic in my '86 951's 
     transaxle, and it does in fact shift easier.  I won't know if it's 
     better in the cold until I drive the car this winter, but I anticipate 
     only a slight improvement, if any at all.
        I have heard that all synthetics in general can "cause" leaks in an 
     older engine that has been drinking natural oil all its life because 
     synthetics are better at finding all those nooks and crannies (i.e. 
     weak and potentially leaky areas that naturals rarely reached anyway).  
     I don't know how this may apply to transaxles, but I haven't heard of 
     anyone complaining about springing leaks after switching to synthetic.
        As for the hype about Mobil 1 being corrosive on the yellow metals, 
     I don't believe it.  I know several people who race 951's and 944's 
     with Mobil 1 and haven't had any problems.

Hello all,
     
     First of all, I would like to thank everyone for such an
informative and entertaining list.  I don't know where I would be 
without it.
     
    Secondly, I have a question about sythetic oils.  I am considering
synthetics in the transaxle.  Has anyone had any experience with this. 
Does it seem to ease the shifting in colder climates?  I was also told 
(or read somewhere) that sythetics make the vehicle more prone to leaks. 
Is this true or does it only pertain to older vehicles (pre 1980)? 
Should I also consider sythetics in the engine?  If so, what weight?  I 
am currently using Valvoline 20-50.
     
Your thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated...
