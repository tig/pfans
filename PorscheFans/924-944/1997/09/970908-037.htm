I just recently purchased an '87 924S and it has started idling very
erradically, but always too high.  It usually goes to 1100, or 2000, but
sometimes goes somewhere in between.  On a sticker in the engine
compartment, it says it should be 850.

Also, There is a fuse that I noticed was burnt out, and replaced it, and
it burned out again by the next day.  I can't figure out what it's for. 
Anyway, it's in the little (auxilliary, I think) fuse panel, and it's
number for.  While you're at it, what's number 7 for?

Thanks in advance!!

It became apparent that one reason why the Ice Giants were known as the
Ice
Giants was because they were, well, giants. The other was that they were
made
of ice.
