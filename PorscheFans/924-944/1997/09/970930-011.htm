russ: 
i've been picking up bits and pieces about 924 transmission changes through
82, heres what i've learned so far, and keep in mind i havent verified all of
the info.
according to haynes manual (1984 print edition), there were 5 different
transmissions slotted for the 924 between 1976 and 1982. these included:
1. 1976-1978:  4 speed (0/16  ) gearbox behind differential   
2. 1978-1979:  5 speed (016/z) gearbox infront of the differential.
3.  1980          5 speed (016/9) similiar to 4speed set-up but w/5.
4.  1980          5 speed (016/z) like the 78-79 model but had a modified
gearbox for                           "TURBOS"
5.   1977-1982  RL automatic
 
now on the n/a 924's (according to jim pasha from excellance magazine), the
1980.5 through 1982 5-speed will bolt up to a 1978 drivetube with no
modification.

on the 1980 931, using the above info (assuming its accurate), the 1979 016/z
transaxel should bolt right in. but i've put this on the Pfans list, so it
can be verified. 

i just replaced my early 78 4spd with a late 78 4sp (same tranny but actually
works), was pretty much a straight forward job. just make sure youve got the
ten point cv tool, a good jack, and a transmission jack would really help. i
used my floor jack and cut a block of wood to stabilize the unit as i pull it
out, primitive but effective. and if youve got a bad back, have someone else
drag that sucker from out under the car.

hope this helps a little,
