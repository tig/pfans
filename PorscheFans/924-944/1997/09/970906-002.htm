Regarding strange oil consumption, I have a theory and some facts:

My car used oil in an unexplainable way. No leaks evident at all, no
small puddles (or even stains) under the car at the parking place -
nothing.

Here's what I found out:

There was a leak, alright, It was not a very big one, but significant.
The oil dropped at the engine gravel shield and stayed there, because
the gravel shield have a lot of shallow indentations. 

They are just put there to make it light and stiff, it is no particular
evil thought behind it. 

Suffice to say, the shield will hold a respectable quantity of oil. Mine
is a 'daily driver' and it will not sit for any great lenght of time.
Every time the car is driven on the road, the wind and motion will dump
any puddle that may be accumulated, but will do it elsewhere than on
your driveway, hence no tell tale puddle... until I took the gravel
shield off for a oil change and a general checkout. Now, as I know, it
is easy to see any oil accumulations, but it evaded me for some time.   

Porsches are certainly not supposed to leak, but if the engine is
running nicely, the plugs are clean, the compression is good, no sooty
exhaust fumes and no blue (oil) as opposed to black (rich mixture) smoke
- then a oil leak is your best bet.

It is normal for oil seals to breath a small amount, and just a little
oil evidence around seals is not a concern, but a steady dripping is. 

Let's do some numbers: 

10 drops of oil will (roughly) add up to 1 milliliter. A quart is around
450 ml, 4500 drips of oil. At a rate of a drop every minute, a quart
will be lost in 75 hours, wich is just three days.
