>Also, I have seen many references to Vertex (in Miami?) and Paragon =

     Products, but cannot find an address/phone number/email to contact =

     them.  Could someone pass these on to me?
     <

Paragon Products (800)200-9366-orders, (512)289-8834, talk to Jason, PCA
and list member, owns and races Porsches, very helpful, good products and=

prices.  I have ordered from him over the years and keep going back.

Vertex- I ordered bearings, gaskets, belts, rollers and a water pump from=

them.  They called back and raised the price on the belt and roller
package.  Said they could not honor their ad price.  Then they shipped th=
e
order COD cash only without telling me.  I call and question why they sen=
t
it cash only and request them to authorize UPS to take a company check. =

They refuse.  Since I don't wander around with $500 on my hip, I have to
make a special trip to the bank.  The next day when I receive the package=
,
I find the main bearings are damaged.  They just placed everything in a b=
ox
with no packing.  I call them and complain that the bearings are damaged.=
 =

They tell me to return the bearings and they will replace them.  I point
out my engine is ready to be assembled and needs to be running by a certa=
in
date.  They reluctantly agree to issue a call tag and ship a replacement.=
 =

My parting words are, "Make sure you ship them next day air".  =


The next day UPS shows up with a call tag but no replacement bearings.  I=

wait another day and call them.  After a big run around, they finally adm=
it
they shipped the replacement regular UPS.  I request they ship another se=
t
next day air.  They will do this only if I pay for another set plus air
freight.  I point out they were the ones that caused the problem, but thi=
s
falls on deaf ears.  For a week, I have to listen to my engine builder
saying, "Where are my bearings?", "Where are my bearings?".  In the
following months, I receive several calls from Vertex wanting to know why=
 I
have not returned the damaged bearings.  Then a call from UPS wanting to
inspect the bearings.

Vertex has cheap prices if you can live with the incompetent service.  I
can't.
