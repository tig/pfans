I am still having a problem with front wheel shimmy, and need some assistance 
in diagnosing the cause (I suspect it is the tires). Here is what I have done:

o New Front wheel Bearings  (This Spring, I have recently checked and repacked)
o Rebuilt Alloy A-Arms        "
o New Tie rod ends            "
o New Brake rotors and pads  (Last Week)
o New Pirelli P700Z 205/50-15 on Front Wheels (1,300 miles ago, end of July)
o New Bridgestone Potenza RE71 225/50-15 on rear wheels (last Week)
o Rennsport re-finish and truing of wheels (received back last week)
o Mount and balance at local Porsche Dealer (~$73)

- There is some slight play in the front struts (Mostly the left side)
- I have measured rotor wobble to be less than 0.002" total on the car
- Wheel wobble mounted on the car is less than 0.003" total
- Steering is tight and responsive, wheel shimmy sets in at about 60mph and 
reduces with greater speeds but never really goes away (still can tell it is 
there at ~120Mph) The rear wheels must be slightly out of balance as well 
because I can feel the chassis vibrations come and go as the front and rear 
wheel vibrations go in and out of phase due to the difference in tire 
diameter. The effect on the steering wheel is to cause it to wobble back and 
forth slightly.

Given the above, I suspect the tires are out of round or have flat spots. Last 
night, I tried to take measurements to verify this conclusion. Here is what I 
measured using the same surface gauge I used to measure the rotors and wheels, 
it has 0.001" marks (I used a caliper to measure tread depth)

Left Pirelli P700Z (205/50-15)
Total High spot to Low spot difference in radius: 0.072" 
Total Tread Depth difference measured at high and low spots: 0.006"  

Right Pirelli P700Z (205/50-15)
Total High spot to Low spot difference in radius: 0.108"
Total Tread Depth difference measured at high and low spots: 0.002"

Left Bridgestone Potenza RE71 (225/50-15)
Total High spot to Low spot difference in radius: 0.052"
Total Tread Depth difference measured at high and low spots: 0.003"

Right Bridgestone Potenza RE71 (225/50-15)
Total High spot to Low spot difference in radius: 0.046" 
Total Tread Depth difference measured at high and low spots: 0.007"

Tread depth on the above tires was 0.300" (+0.008" -0.001"), measurements were 
repeatable to within +-0.001"

Radius measurements were repeatable to within better than 0.001" for the 
better wheels, but I had to use a feeler gauge for the tires that were really 
out of round due to the range limit of my surface gauge so the larger 
measurements (0.072" and 0.108") are within +-0.04" or so..

Since the radius differences were so large (and can be seen as the wheel is 
spun) I can not believe the measurements accurately reflect rolling tire 
radius. I suspect that most of the deformation is due to the tire being 
deformed with the vehicle parked. What seems strange is that the tire can 
remain deformed even after jacking the vehicle up. To test this theory, I left 
the right side of the vehicle jacked up last night, and repeated measurements 
this morning on the right side. The Rear Bridgestone went from 0.046" to 
0.030", certainly an improvement. The Front Pirelli appeared to be just as bad 
by visual inspection, so I didn't measure it. How can I get the tires to their 
non-deformed state? Heat? Time without load? Over-pressurize? Spin at an 
incredibly high speed without load?

I am trying to determine if these tires have manufacturers defects, ie. are 
out of round. I bought all four from Tire Rack. If there are no manufacturers 
defects, I would like to shave the tires to help obtain a better balance. I 
built a jig with linear bearings adjustable in the X-Y-Theta axis with my 
Dremel Moto Tool Flex Shaft mounted on it such that I can grind spinning 
objects to within ~0.001". I would like to use this jig to shave the tires, 
but if I spin them as I did for the above measurements, I will be making them 
worst. If the tires have manufacturers defects, I would like to get 
replacements from Tire Rack, but do not want to pursue this until I am sure 
the tires are truly defective.

Other than for the month during which the wheels were being re-finished at 
Rennsport, I drive it daily, so the tires have not been subjected to extended 
periods of sitting in one spot.

As always, all advice is greatly appreciated, sorry about the length of my 
post.

TIA,
    Ezra
