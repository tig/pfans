4. Problems with stuttering and not being able to accelerate past 2000rpm.
   I mentioned that I had this and had a 2 second solution.  It was the
   connector for the flapper door or air flow sensor.  Just a wiggle 
   solved it.  I took it off, cleaned it and re-installed and haven't had
   a problem since.  With Paul's car, we had the same thing happen with
   the TPS sensor, take it off and clean and all is fine now.

5. Coolant being lost from the tank.  I know you're thinking, oh no,
   not another water pump for Farzaan!  Well, I lucked out, it was just
   a few hoses that needed cleaning at the contact points and a tightening,
   three hoses in fact.  Hopefully all should be fine.

6. S0-2 tires are being put on.  The rear Dunlops are dead at 14,000mi.
   I'd say, they could go another 3-5,000mi, but it rains here a lot so
   I don't want bald tires.  I could have gotten just rears, but I've run
   Dunlops for like 4 years now on all my cars and want to try something
   new.  I still feel like cancelling the order and getting a fresh set
   of Dunlop's on the rears, but I've gotta try the S-02, they look so cool!
   Did any other S-02 users notice that they didn't stick very well when
   relatively new?

7. Still haven't put the brake cooling kit on, so no comments on installation
   ease, but the parts look cool.

BTW - I re-read my last email about the racing stuff and wanted to mention
that the whole year was not grim, there were a lot of good days where I
ended up near the top overall, usually at test and tune days and the like.
If it was a high speed event, where lag didn't matter, I usually fared better
than the APE crowd of 944T's, and at Bremerton, with our street tires, we
trounced the local 944T and most 911 drivers.  Paul and myself were within
6/1000th's of each other and within 3 seconds of Jodi Fordahl's FTD in an
A/SP prepared 911 RS America on R1 rubber.

That's it for now, I probably will be busy for the next while so you won't
have to read my novels for a while :)

Congratulations to all 924/944/968 drivers who did well this year in their
respective racing series!  I'll be at the top next year!

Farzaan.
A/SS 4th place out of 13 cars :( (should've been 2nd out of 13)
