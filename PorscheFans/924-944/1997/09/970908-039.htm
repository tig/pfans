Hello,

Thanks to all that gave me feedback on my cylinder pressures.  I think 
all is well...  Let me explain.  The car was involved in an engine 
fire, quite a bit of the wiring and plastics were melted.  The fire 
appears to have been located around cylinders 1 and 2, where most of 
the burning took place.(fuel)

After removing the intake manifold, fuel hoses and wiring harness I 
had a great view of the top of the engine and the turbocharger.  The 
car has been sitting for about 2 years without motion.  I drained the 
oil to look for water (cracked head?) the oil was as clean as it could 
be for being 2+ years old.  I replaced the oil filter and oil.

I placed a wire on the solenoid to act as my "KEY" in the ingition and 
turned the engine over about 10 - 15 times and then let it sit and 
stew in its new oil.  I repeated this 3 more times.  The pressures I 
got on what I'll consider "DRY" cylinders were: 1,150; 2,145; 3,145; 
4,90.  Thinking possibly having a stuck ring on #4 I shot in a couple 
of squirts of oil into each cylinder and repeated my cranking 
procedure.  The next set of pressures were quite large...200+ across 
the board.

Knowing that compressing a oil is quite hard to do, I elected to let 
the car sit for 3 days allowing the oil in the cylinders to seep down 
into the block.  The next set of pressures were much better and have 
stayed very consistant: 1,165; 2,163; 3,165; 4,160.

Enough with pressures...Now the Questions...

First, seens how I have a great view of the Turbo...Should I take the 
time to rebuild it?  Current mileage on the engine is just under 
89,000.  I've seen rebuild kits for around $250 bucks, but I've never 
done one before, any suggestions?

Second,  I have a lump of molten wiring harness.  I've priced new and 
used, lets say I'm not impressed with the price tag to replace it. 
 I've been toying with the idea of building a custom harness, but I 
would need all the ends or connectors for it.  Does anyone know where 
I could locate new/factory connectors and what the part numbers would 
be, or even if they would be available?

Thanks.

Smalldog...Are you reading this one?
