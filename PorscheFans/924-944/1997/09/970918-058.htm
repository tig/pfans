Charles, I installed one of these metal rads from P.P. about 4 years ago
(when they were 'only' $429).  At that time, I did call many a rad shop and
auto parts store to try and find it cheaper to no avail.  I think I had
even managed to contact the manufacturer directly but the price was the
same!  I even tried to get a local shop to custom make me a metal one to
fit (based on a standard core of similar size).  No dice, they chickened
out.  Perhaps you will be luckier.  However, I had gone through my 3rd(!)
plastic/aluminum rad and was tired of forking over $200 for an eventual
unfixable crack in the plastic.

I have an early 944 and although P.P. claims the rad bolts right in, it
didn't.  I had to do a bit of cutting and filing on some sheet metal in the
area where the bottom of the rad sits.  Also, it was a tad too wide and I
had to actually dent in the end tanks slightly to get it to fit between the
rails.  Keep in mind that with an aluminum engine, you don't want any metal
to metal contact (between the rad and car ground) or a galvanic corrosion
cell may be set up (dissimilar metals in an electrolyte; the aluminum will
be sacrificed to the copper/brass).

However, I have had no problems with it and it has been in there about 60K
miles.  If you plan to hold on to your car for the long term, it is worth
doing in my opinion.
