Just came back from running several errands - about a 50 mile round trip.
Traffic was pretty light, roads were smooth, about 65 deg. F, and my car
('86 951) was running like a top.  When I'm in a real hurry (trying to get
to the
store before it closed - just made it) and thrashing on the car, it seems to
wake up - all of the control responses quicken.  Totally different character
from driving it in rush hour traffic.  Most cars get sloppy when driven very
hard, but the 951 is the opposite - it tightens up and seems to smile when the
hammer is dropped.  Driving the car in rush hour traffic makes one forget how
much fun the car is when driven at 9/10 - and that it really was designed to be 
able to be driven this hard all the time.  Starting a passing maneuver at
75-80 mph
and getting into full boost in 4th gear,  I watched the speedo twist over
100 and
realized that the car has a certain narcotic effect at high speed - the
so-sluggish-
around-town gearing changes to just-about-perfect above 65 mph.  Braking hard 
into the exit ramp sweeper, then accelerating onto the main road, I achieved a
state of bliss, with exhaust growling, turbo hissing, and tires grabbing,
yanking
the car up to speed in a big precision rush......Yeahhhhhhhhh.
