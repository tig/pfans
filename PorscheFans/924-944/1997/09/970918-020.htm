Hey,

FWIW, my stock '87 951 with stock DME/KLR chips only went to about =
1.1-1.2 bar max boost on gauge, from what I remember.  With the chip =
upgrade (Weltmeister chips + shimmed wastegate) it goes to about 1.9 on =
the guage. I'm pretty sure my car was very healthy before the chip =
upgrade, so I think it's true that the stock '86-'87 models had very =
mild boost levels.

Of course since my number of data points is only one, the normal =
disclaimers apply.  Check it with the experts.  Am I right 951 experts? =
(George B., Don Istook, etc., etc.)

BTW, the latest Excellence magazine has an excellent article on the 951 =
models this month by Jim Pasha.  I also noticed several new advertisers =
with some low priced parts that seem to be in demand ( belt tension =
guage, 944 service manual set, etc.)  This month's issue is great, so =
check it out.
