I remember the joke about Firestones.

What are the two ways firestones will kill you?
Putting them round your neck and setting them on fire. or
Putting them on your car.

The tires I have on a 93 968 are the Firestone Firehawk SZ50.  215/45/17
front and 255/40/17 rear.  Since I track the car and have dedicated
track tires & wheels for that purpose I wanted an inexpensive high
performance tire that had extraordinary wet performance and were
reasonably quiet.  These tires are all that and some.  I have tried the
Dunlop D40M2, Michelin XGT-Z4, Bridgestone Potenza RE71 and Goodyear
GS-C models at one time or another.  The Firestones beat them all in
every aspect.  Even did a couple of track laps on them and was
pleasantly surprised at how well the did.  They are also almost the
cheapest high performance tire available.  Check them out.  You won't be
disappointed.
