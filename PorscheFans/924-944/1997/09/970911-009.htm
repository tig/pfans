Hello all;

     Is there any advantage of going to an authorized Porsche dealer
for service vs an independent Porsche specialist as far as covering
a future problem that might develop that is related to the performed
service.  What I'm getting at is say if I have new belts and rollers
done
on my car and then in 10,000 miles or a year the belt breaks and the
valves meet Mr. Piston would Porsche Cars of N. America or the 
authorized dealer be more likely to help cover the resulting damage
than say if an independent had done the work.  In this example I'm
assuming the parts are genuine Porsche parts which carry a two
year warranty right?  Does it matter who installs the parts.  In
general the warranty doesn't cover consequential damage but I've
heard hints that PCNA might help you out in some cases.  What
has been the groups experiences?  Thanks

Question 2:  WARNING may be of interest to Mass. Pfans only:

My 45,000 mile service is coming up soon for my 968 and I need
to pick a place to have the work done.  I think we are very lucky
here in Mass to have so many good Porsche specialist, the problem
is deciding whom to go to.  I wish I had enough Porsches to go to
them all but ..........   My short list is:
EPE
Precision Performance Repair
Clair (if a Dealer) 
Randolph Racing
Kevin Gross at ???  Where does he work?

I'm sure I've forgotten many others so please let me know what you
recommend and any good/bad experiences you've had.
Thanks again
