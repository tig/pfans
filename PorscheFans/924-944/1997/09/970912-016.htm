Hi Greg,

The tendency of wide high performance tires to follow road irregularities is
called tramlining, and is normal.  The amount of tramlining depends on both
the tire and alignment.  I had some Yoko 008Ps that followed every crevice
on the road.  You couldn't stop hard in an absolutely straight line.  I
switched to BFG ZRs, and the tramlining is about 25% of what it was.  They
are also quieter, have better grip, better ride, and are cheaper.

The other variable is alignment.  I would be cautious about taking you car
to a regular tire place for a good four wheel alignment.  This is based upon
my own experience at various tire shops over the years.  Take it to a
Porsche shop that the local PCA autocross crowd goes to.  You will get a far
superior job at about the same price.

Gary
