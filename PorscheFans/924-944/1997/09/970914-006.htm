>knock it off with the big haired women already.  

I'm a short-haired woman guy myself (no, no displaced lad fixation,
boys)...

As I'm leaving the country for a year (nothing to do with short-haired
women, though), I thought I'd leave this quote from Doug Adams as a parting
shot til next June:

There came a machine sweeping out of the rain toward him with lights
streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine
streaked toward him. It was a low, bulbous shape, like a small whale
surfing -- sleek, grey, and rounded and moving at terrifying speed.
The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit
only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off  into the
night.
It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky
which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a
small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared.
To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, "My other
car is also a Porsche."


Cheers,
Neil
