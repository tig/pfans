Phil,

The school solution, of course, is to use a CO meter, but the following 
method will get you close.    

        - Set the idle a little high, perhaps 1000 rpm

        - Use your CIS mixture tool (3mm Allen wrench) and lean out the 
mixture (counterclockwise usually) until the engine just begins to run rough.
At this point you will have starved the engine of fuel.   Manually activate the
throttle sharply and note that the engine stumbles.    This is because the 
sudden opening of the throttle butterfly takes the engine even leaner and
hardly provides a combustible mixture at all.

        - At this point you should have noted about how far you had to turn the
mixture screw to make the mixture too lean.   This will give you an idea of
how far you will have to turn it back.   Some systems have coarser threads
than others and are therefore more sensitive to adjustments.

        - Now begin an alternating procedure by which you slightly enrich the
mixture and test it with short throttle bursts until the "lean stagger" JUST
goes away.   Do it back and forth a couple of times to make sure you have
it right.    You are now very close to the leanest mixture which will still run
well.   This will give you the best fuel economy and be very close to the
lowest CO possible.   

        - Depending on the CIS system, you will have quite a bit of enrichment
available, all the way to where there is so much fuel pouring in that the plugs
drown, foul, and miss.    Between this point and the best lean mixture 
described above you will generally just waste fuel without much other benefit.
However, if you drive the car hard, especially a turbo, two other factors need
to be considered.

                --  First, an excessively lean mixture will run hot, and in
a turbo this
is real bad for the engine.   Real bad.

                --  Second, at high boost, the turbo will require more fuel
or it simply
will not develop the power it should

So once you have established the initial idle mixture described above, you may
have to incrementally enrich the mixture until the engine both runs cool enough
and develops maximum power.   This is where paying attention at the beginning
will help you out.   You don't want to spin the adjustment two full turns and 
drown the plugs, when 1/4 turn will do the job.   Learn the basic sensitivity
of the adjustment and go from there.

Best of luck.

Dave
