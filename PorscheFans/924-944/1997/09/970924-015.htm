I just want to raise one word of caution concerning the use of racing
brake pads on the street. Street pads have an operating temperature of
300 degrees or so. This means that maximum coefficient of friction will
be available at that temperature. Racing pads have an operating
temperature of greater than 600 degrees. This means they don't work very
well when cold. This also means they will only work marginally when
warm.

There are some 'compromise' brake compounds that have a lower operating
temperature but still work reasonably well at racing temperatures. I use
these on my street/track 951S. They are also better for autocrossing
since you usually don't get the brakes that hot.

So if you are using racing pads on the street, be *very* careful on your
first few stops and stop more aggresively to keep the temperatures up.
(But officer, if I don't drive that way my car won't stop.) In the event
of an accident try not to mention that point - racing pads are *not*
DOT-legal! They also tend to squeal a lot more.
