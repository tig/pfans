Jeff,
The screw is an idle speed adjustment, The o ring probably needs to be
replaced.

The hose you refered to is for cooling your altenator. The factory put
the altenator stuffed so tight you cant even see it. Try crawling under
the driver side fender (with the car jacked up a few inches) the alt is
back about even with the tires look straight up. I would try to place
this hose on. The altenator gets no air, this could be bad for the
diodes and brushes.

Hi, PorscheFans,

	This is a repeat of a request from the 17th. I'm sure one of you can help =
me=21 I am looking for someone other than Pepe Porsche Audi (Sure=21 That'l=
l be =24300=21) in White Plains to do a Pre-Purchase Inspection on an 89 94=
4S2. The owner is willing to drive about 10-15 miles to drop the car off. A=
ny recommendations for an independent who's great with 944's in the area fr=
om Mt. Vernon, NY to Stamford, CT? Of course if =24300 is the going rate an=
d Pepe P/A is recommended, then I'll just lift my Maine Boy jaw and go ther=
e (Same work in ME? =2450. =24120 if leakdown done). So, please drop me a n=
ote. I'm waiting on your recommendations.


	BTW, thanks again to Kevin Gross, Bruce Anderson and all the other PFans w=
ho helped me with my Qs re: 944S2 head damage. The best response came from =
Rick Beardsley. I've deleted some:
