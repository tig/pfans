I'll make a wild guess here and say that the boot cover and A/C were
standard equipment on the model for the year  that you have. I know that
Mercedes gives owners the option to delete equipment from the standard
spec, the only one I can remember was the ashtray and cigarette lighter
but I'm sure there are others. Porsche would undoubtedly have a similar
system where a customer could up or down spec a car to their own
requirements, notably if that car is to be gutted for racing.

OK, I have decoded most of them except C03 which I assume has something
to
do with the CAT.  My next question is why are there a number of obvious
options on my car that aren't on the options list?  I opviously have
climate control, I also have the boot cover...why aren't they listed?
