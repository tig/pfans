     I bent my front "jacking point" the first time I went to put the car 
     on a lift. From then on I use the frame rails. The factory manual says 
     something to the effect of "the frame rails are the only accepted lift 
     points in the front of the car." 
     
     
     As to whether you should change your belts at 30K or 50k or 60k...
     
     First of all, the maintenance schedule says nothing at all about belt 
     replacement. (of course I'm not suggesting they don't need replaced) 
     It does, however, recommend that they are "inspected" every 45k miles. 
     While replacing and tensioning MIGHT be outside the abilities of the 
     average backyard mechanic, inspecting them is NOT.  On my 951 I can 
     have the upper plastic cover off in under 10 minutes. (this is with 
     all the proper tools, including a 1/4 drive air ratchet, and a fair 
     amount of experience, ). This is a good way for you to become more 
     mechanically aquainted with your Porsche, without running much risk of 
     making expensive mistakes.  (I've always thought you never truly 
     appreciate German cars until you really examine the engineering that 
     goes into them, but I digress)  I inspect my belts every 5-10k miles. 
     If the belts are not Absolutely clean and there are cracks or wear 
     marks or missing teeth it is time to replace the belt. If after 
     looking at the condition of the belt you still have doubt, it is 
     probably time to replace it.  My guess is after 30k your belt will 
     still look pristine. And after seeing it with your own eyes you will 
     sleep better for the next 10k miles not worrying whether or not you 
     are driving a time bomb.  Also, take some time to listen for a 
     slapping belt. A belt does not have to be very loose before you will 
     hear it slapping against the housing. --But you will have to open the 
     hood and stand in front of the car to hear it. If it is loose you WILL 
     hear it. A belt will not get tighter over time. So, provided it was 
     tensioned properly in the first place, and its not slapping, and it 
     looks like new, then you can be 97% sure that you will not have any 
     belt failures.  That last 3% risk is VERY expensive to eliminate. 
        
     
     Every time you have a belt changed you run the risk that the belt is 
     defective or the mechanic doing the job is an idiot (or just having an 
     "off" day). So even if you don't care about throwing the money away, 
     you may be replacing a good belt with a bad one or paying to have your 
     car screwed up. 
     
     
     Just my opinion.
