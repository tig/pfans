Hey John 
      I would suspect a couple of things.  1) A sticking IAC valve (or idle
stabalizer valve, located under the intake manifold between cyl #2 & #3) when
the idle sticks up at high RPM's take a good sized screw driver and "tap" the
idle stabalizer valve, if the idle goes to normal speed - the valve is bad!
 2) check the TPS (throttle position switch). This is a common cause of
drivabilty problems on 944's. Check to see if you hear the sensor make a
click as you open the throttle plate, also check the resistance values per
the repair manual. I would also take this time to use a good quality
electrical connector cleaner on both male & female connections. 3) check for
a broken or colapsed motor mount causing the engine to kink the accel cable
linkage. Look at the rubber boot that runs fron the intercooler pipe to the
throtlle body, it should run straight back. If this rubber boot (about
4inches long, that flares open to the throttle) swings to the left/pass side
(looking in from the front of the car/engiine) than the motor mounts are bad!
 4) Work the throttle manual from idle to full throttle (with the engine
off!) the motion should be smooth and linear, if not remove the black rubber
boot and use some gum-out to clean off all the oil/gum/slime biuld up off the
inner workings of the throttle body.
      						Good Luck

Hope someone has an idea about this problem. When I decelerate, It feels
like someone pushing on the gas for just a second, then it stops, then it
pushes again. It does it only when I turn it off completely warmed up and
start it again within 1/2 hour or so. It never does it if I start it cold
or if I wait more than an hour after turning engine off. My mechanic's only
thought was the throttle cable, but that seems like it would happen all the
time if it was the cable.It will do it in neutral as well, with the rpm's
taking a long time to go back to idle. It reminds me of a car with a bad
carbeurator.(sp)
The car is a 88 951, Weltmeister chip, K&N, Borla exhaust.
Any advice would be appreciated.

John Pohl
