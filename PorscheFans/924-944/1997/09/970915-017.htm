I have an 83' 944 that had a slight cam problem. It started as a slight ticking or 
knocking noise. Because it was barely audible over the normal noise of the 
engine it was assumed to possibly be an exhaust leak. Shortly later the barely 
audile "exhaust leak" became something much worse. My water cooled Porsche began 
to sound as if it had a desiel engine under the hood. Apparently the bolt which 
holds the drive gear to the cam had come loose. What I was hearing was the gear 
slipping back and forth 2-3 degrees on the cam. All the while; the key on the 
cam was tearing into the keyway. The keyway cut into the cam which originally 
looked something like this-> |_| now looked like this-> \_/. There was only 
slight damage to a couple of valves, but the cam is unfixable... Performed a 
quick fix with some lock-tite and JB weld to the cam which has held up perfectly 
for more than 12,000 miles.

Now to the problem. I will be purchasing a new cam, preferably not stock. I'd 
prefer a performace grinded cam. Could anyone offer recommendations for a 
performace cam. I will also be having the head rebuilt, so any recommendations 
for a good Porsche performance shop in L.A. county would be appreciated. Also if 
anyone has knowledge about performance mods to this car I'd really like to hear 
them.

Thanks for the help.
