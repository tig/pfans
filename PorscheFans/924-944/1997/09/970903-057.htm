original msg:
I've been looking for a set of track tires (DOT approved) that I could
use to
drive to and from track events (in addition to driving at the track) .
I'm
looking at BFGoodrich R1s, however I'm a little worried about wet
weather
drivability.  The other tire I'm looking is the Yokohama A032r, which
has deep
water grooves in it.
Since I don't have an extra set of wheels, or the ability to haul my
car, I
have to resort to some semi streetable tires.
Any help? (or interest)
Thanks!

reply:

Don't bother with one set of tires/rims. If you are serious about track
time or autocross
get a second set of rims. Call a junk yard or ask around. Somebody in my
PCA
region is always selling some in the newsletter. It is cheap insurance
if you have 
hydroplaned on street tires before; it is much worse on track tires. I
have Yoko
A008RSII, They are awesome for autocrossing and scarry in the rain. The
grooves 
you speak of in the tires will soon disappear with miles and events.
Good Luck.
