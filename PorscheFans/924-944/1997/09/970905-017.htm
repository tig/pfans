Oh Yeah! Speakers !

I would like to introduce the bass reflex variety with coupled speakers
too, as an more complex alternative to the common bass reflex box. With
a correctly calculated port and suitable elements, that box may be able
to give a thight, yet powerfull bass. (Thats the kind of speaker where
the elements sit face to face, and the bass reflex port is located
traditionally - facing outwards. The theory is (simplified!) that the
two elements keep each other steady at resonance frequencies, both the
box's and the element's. All bass reflex designs, even the 'simpler'
ones rely very much on matching the element to the box and the port -
otherwise they will resonance badly, just as Ben suggest.   

Now we may have a slight problem as the car in question is a cab. I seem
to recall when I wast las drooling over one of those, that they have a
'traditional' luggage compartment ? Then, any box will have to be built
to fit into the back seat - or the luggage area itself can be a 'sealed
enclosure'. It will be so large volume, that it will be easy driven, but
may need special considerations when choosing speaker elements.  

For bass speakers to really make a difference, I'll go with Bens
suggestion for a closed box - for easy construction and predictable
performance. I would also recommend keeping to 10 or 12 inch, as 15
inchers will need a fairly large box. OTOH, using the luggage as speaker
box, they will be very suitable. Expect to use at least 100 W (thats car
audio, lean, lazy RMS Watts) amplifier(s) and buy one (or two, one for
each side) with a  built in low pass filter. Do not skimp on cable size,
and ground all equipment at the same place.

Then, you can bass all cars on the highway, without fear of tickets...
hehehehe
