What would be involved in converting a 1985 to a 1985.5 944. Would it be
physically possible. Would it be financially prohibitive?

In an '85.5 or newer what would be necessary to replace a cracked dash top.
I definitely don't want to drive around with a rug on the dash
TIA

>>>>>>dash replacement is rough, and expensive, i felt it wasnt worth the
$800.00 expense only to have it crack again in a year, so i went with a dash
cap instead for about $100.00. i was carefull with the installation,  its by
no means perfect, but to me its better than the alternative , i've also found
that "civilians" cant tell the difference. and yes, i use a "rug" also, but
only when the car is parked in the sun, i hide it under the seat when im
driving . it serves its purpose as a sun sheild for my plastic dash cover.

78-924 (plastic dash thingy with hideaway rug option, and pending head
rebuild}
