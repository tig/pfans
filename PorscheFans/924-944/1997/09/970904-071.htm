Just wanted to let you guys know of a reasonable priced track day coming
up.  It's at Mission Raceway Park on Oct. 13th, 1997.  Cost is about C$100
or US$70 for the whole day.  You will be put into one of two groups, novice or
senior.  

The track isn't particularly enjoyable, but you still get to blast out of
a 2nd gear carasoul(sp) and head down the straight up to about 210km/h,
then brake like hell to a 2nd gear hairpin.  

The main attraction of this event are the other cars.  These are confirmed:
- 1993 RX-7 with NA tri-rotor motor
- 1993 RX-7 with single turbo upgrade
- 1994 Supra TT with usual boost mods
- 240SX with Japanese 2.0L turbo motor
- Various Civics to pass
- Paul, myself, Darren, Lou, and Tim's 944T's
- probably Wes's S2 (Wes, you coming?)

Contact me for more info.

I want to send a special thanks to Jason at Paragon for helping me source
a set of brake cooling ducts that pipe into the center of the rotor.  He
did not have any in stock so he gave me a COMPETITOR's number to call so
that I could get them in time.  That impresses me.  Sooner or later, I'm
gonna need a clutch, I know where I'll be going.

I also ordered a set of Porterfield R4-S brake pads for the track event.
I really should have gotten the RACE pad (the R4), but I used the R4-S
last year in the rain on my Talon and that thing had much smaller brakes
and almost no cooling compared to this car and it was heavier.  The R4-S
is far superior to a Metal Master pad and they can be driven to and from
the track.  I'll let you know how they are after the event.  The Hawk
Browns that I bought before are being returned in exchange for the
Porterfields (pretty good company eh?).

Wow, $5 per gallon.  I wish they'd charge that much over here, it would
keep the roads so much clearer for me to bomb around :)

Farzaan.
