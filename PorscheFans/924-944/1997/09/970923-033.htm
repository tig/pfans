2.	Refill the fluid with a real good DOT-4 fluid, I use ATE Supper
Blue.

Instead of the ATE fluid, try Ford High Performance fluid.  It has a =
higher dry boiling point and is have the price.  Here in Minnesota (Nord =
Stern PCA region) this is the fluid 75% of the track drivers use.  It =
seems to be a little know secret and the stuff is so cheap and Porsche =
brakes are so easy to bleed, I completely change the fluid before each =
track event. =20

The fluid should be available at all Ford dealerships.


6.	Reinstall wheels and tighten to about 90 ft/lbs. (start with
just tight, then lower to ground and tighten to correct torque)


Actually although we are splitting hairs now, Porsche specs call for 94 =
ft/lbs.


	As for Pads:

	Unless you are really racing I would stick to a nice soft pad,
they work well when cold and don't make noise. Plus they cost a lot
less. Jurid is the basic OEM pad.=20

I have been using Porterfield racing pads both on the street and track.  =
Typically the first stop or two is slightly better than what the street =
pads felt like and they just get better after that.  If you use the =
anti-vibration discs in the caliper as Porsche intended, I have found =
there to be little to no noise from the pads.  Once you try racing pads, =
you will never go back to street compound pads.
