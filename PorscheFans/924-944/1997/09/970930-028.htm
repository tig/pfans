>Hi!  I'm a sports car enthusiast but a Porsche Novice.  I've owned a 240Z, 2

You asked the big question. I can't resist it. You can get a good 944 S2
for that money ($12K-18K). I have one, and I love it.  They're relatively
new, relatively trouble-free, and a step up in torque and horsepower from
other normally aspirated models. They're a good choice if you don't want to
spend much time messing with your car. If you get a Turbo, you are more
likely to be messing with it. The temptation to buy aftermarket goodies
will be irresistable. Turbos have a lot more parts, increasing the chance
of having to replace something.

The only hassles endemic to the 16-valve models (S and S2) are extra valves
(no big deal) and a cam chain. I just checked mine at 48K to see how the
chain tensioner guide was wearing, and it's got at least another 10-15K of
hard driving before I have to worry about replacing it.  Plus the S2 has
all the upgrades in brakes etc that occured during the course of 944
evolution.

Much depends on how much power you want. The 2.5 liter NA models will give
you as much power (actually a bit more "real world" power) than your Z
cars, and better handling. If you got a very good example of an '85.5-89
2.5/2.7 liter, you'd have cash left over to get the suspension/tires/wheels
etc in great shape. Haven't driven the '89 2.7 liter, but it's supposed to
have some extra torque.

IMHO.
