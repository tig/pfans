Hi Chris,

Hey, it's nice to actually drive the car!

Careful here. The setup for autocross and DE (or racing) are usually
quite different. In autocross, you need to extract the last 100th
of a second. The runs are short, your concentration intense, and
the speeds slow. There is no real consequence (besides times) to 
going off course. 

Generally, for autocross, you don't want understeer, but want a 
little overstear. You need the car to turn in super quick, and 
stability isn't so important. 

The track is different. If you go off there, you can hurt yourself
and the car big time. You don't need every last 100th of a second.
You're going to be in the car for a long time, and you need a car
that's easier to drive, and safe. Generally, for track, you want
some understeer, as that's a lot easier and safer. Get into a corner
too hot, the car pushes, you lift, the car turns. If the tendancy
is oversteer, you go into a corner too hot, lift a little, and spin
off the track. Not fun.

Of course, you don't want too much understeer either. That makes you
slow, and burns up the front tires.

Well a compromise is a compromise. Decide which is more important to
you, and set the car up for that. You can still do the other event,
but the more fun event (for you) will be better. Of course, a good
track car isn't a terrible autocrosser, and vice versa.

That's a good idea, and will remove some of the understeer. The
biggest difference will be done with air pressure, shock changes, 
and swaybar adjustment. 

Are your front shocks set full stiff? If so, that's why you're
getting too much understeer. Try softening them a little. I run
mine at 2/3 stiff, and the car is nicely balanced.

Have you read any books in handling? It's really quite a science.
I could give you some titles.

Basically, to reduce understeer, you need to get more weight onto
the front wheels. By loosening the front shocks, you'll allow more
weight transfer onto the front tires, and they will grip better.
Conversly, by stiffening the REAR swaybar, you'll do the same thing
(in a turn). When the car leans, weight is transferred to the side
of the car. If you stiffen the REAR bar, more weight will go to
outside FRONT tire, and less weight to the outside REAR tire. The
result will be increased grip at the front, and decreased grip at
the rear. Viola, less understeer, more oversteer.

To adjust the stiffness of the rear bar you change the length of
the 'arm'. The longer the arm, the softer the car. The shorter
the arm, the stiffer the bar. The 'arm' is the distance from the
drop link to the pivot point. On Weltmeister bars, there is a sliding
bracket on the droplink. You loosen a bar and slide the mounting
point forward (stiffer) or backwards (looser). 

Make small changes! An inch difference is quite a lot.

Note that to really, REALLY, set up the car, you need a pyrometer
and a stopwatch.

Let me know if you have more questions, this is too long already.
