1. Houston, Texas
2. 1986 944 Turbo, $10,300 (purchased last month)
3. $1.37/gallon for 92 octane
4. $816/year for full coverage (State Farm - Highly Recomended, and 
no - I don't work for them)
5. $50/hour (PCA Member discounted rate at either of two local 
Porsche dealers)

On a side note, anyone driving 130 mph through 7 municipalities 
SHOULD have their license suspended. I'm just glad I wasn't one of 
the many cars you would have passed on your way. 
Keep the track speeds where they belong - on the track. As a PCA 
member, I have many oppertunites
to drive at track speeds - both at Texas World Speedway for Driver's 
Ed, and our local Police departments training facilities where we 
hold our autocross series. This isn't intended to be a flame job - 
just pointing out the benefits of PCA membership. The rates I pay in 
insurance will attest to the fact that having fun in your Porsche 
doesn't require high speed driving on our nations highways.
