Hi All,

Any recommendations?  Preferably between 290 and Compaq.

I have a friend that owns a shop, he has done some basic work on the =
car, but as a friend he is not shy about telling me when he is over his =
head.  If you are a mechanic in Houston, here is the story.

89' 951S with 92k miles

Symptoms:

1.	Very sluggish when cold.  Under normal acceleration, when shifting =
from 2nd to 3rd at about 3,000 RPM (approx.), 3rd gear will slow the car =
down unless greater than 75% throttle is applied.

2.	Engine tries to overheat at idle.  On a hot day, unless the RPM is =
1,200 or higher the cooling system lacks sufficient circulation to cool =
the engine.  Temp will climb to red line unless RPM is maintained.  On =
an extremely hot day the problem exists until the car runs at 60MPH + =
for a few miles, then the temp will return to normal (just above the =
first hash mark).

3.	Engine expels coolant after being driven on Hot day.  This is =
Houston, so lets define HOT.  HOT=3D95+ with the sun out and the =
pavement so hot you could cook eggs on it (or at least burn you feet if =
you were barefoot). On 4 separate occasions the engine has expelled at =
least =BD gallon of  coolant after being driven on a hot day. There =
seems to be a very weird cycle at work here.  My best guess is that I am =
slowly leaking oil into the coolant, this causes the coolant to be less =
effective and reach excessive temperatures after being shut down. When =
the weather and the engine are hot enough this causes a boil over when =
standing after being driven.  But when the fluid is replaced with fresh =
coolant, the problem seems to disappear.  Also, I think that a very hot =
day contributes to the oil leak and causes another episode.

4.	Engine uses OIL.  The engine uses about 1qrt per 1,500 miles.   There =
are no obvious leaks or evidence of burning oil.

5.	Feel of Turbo somewhat erratic.  When under mild but constant =
acceleration the car seems to power surge a bit.  When down shifting =
under no power, the drag produced by the engine is very inconsistent.  =
This is hard to describe but the rate of acceleration seems vary from =
day to day, given the same speed and RPM the power curve seems to =
differ.

6.	A/C not cold enough. I have had the A/C serviced and was told that =
the freon and pressure levels are normal, but the inside air is not as =
cold as it should be.

7.	Battery charge rate questionable.   I think I have a bad voltage =
regulator.  The displayed voltage is almost never above 12.1 volts.  The =
exception was once the battery was dead, for a brief period after that =
the voltage read 13.5.  If the car is only driven for very short =
distances over a week period the battery will lose power and the car =
will eventually not start.

Thanks!

Respectfully,
