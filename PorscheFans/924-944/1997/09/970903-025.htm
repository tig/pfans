I recently decided to give my 951 a good cleaning and a wax job (those
who know me know my car gets washed once a year whether it needs it or
not).  I foolishly decided that now was the time to a  complete
detailing (touch up the pock marks on the nose, do a really good pre-wax
cleaning, etc.). And I decided to replace the stoneguards since they were
not cleaning up well, and were cracked.

So, recalling some advice from this list or its predecessor, I starting
scraping off the old plastic with the aid of a hair dryer.  [ BTW: This
doesn't work well at all!  Most of the glue remains on the car, and I've
not found anything that disolves it easily.  Does anyone have any advice
on how to best remove these things? My hair dryer is kind of whimpy:
would hotter air help?  What sort of solvent cleans up the left over
adhesive best? ]

After spending a couple hours removing one of the guards (the smallest
one!), I decided to give the local dealer a call to make sure he had new
guards in stock. And to check the price. I figured maybe $20-30 bucks
tops. Heck, double that since it's a Porsche, right?  Wrong!  $200 for
what can't amount to more than 2 square feet of sticky plastic?!?  Surely
they must be joking.

So I called Tweeks for a quickee price comparison -- they want $140. 
Tweeks is often not the very cheapest aftermarket mail order place, but
they're usually in the ballpark with the rest.

Ackpht!

Can anyone suggest 
	1) a cheaper source, 
	2) a non-Porsche alternative (e.g. clear contact paper from the
	   local hardware store :-)), and 
	3) a less frustrating way to remove the old ones?
