Dave, in response to your question on the effectiveness of 944 A/C, I feel
I am qualified to reply here. I live in south Florida, the humidity capital
of the U.S., and have found my 1985's A/C to be totally satisfactory in our
arduous summers.  In fact, I rarely need to put it on full blast and in the
10 years I have owned the car I have only needed to have it recharged
twice.  It apparently has a very small leak; so small that it cannot be
found with one of those electronic sniffers.  At 165K miles it still has
all the original components and works great (I may pay for saying
this)......

The updated 944 series (1985&1/2 on) do have a fully integrated A/C system,
unlike what is in my car.  I doubt its performance would be any less
effective than mine but perhaps some owners of these newer cars will
comment.
