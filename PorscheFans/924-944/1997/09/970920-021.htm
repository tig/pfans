I could use help in identifying two parts on my '87 951:

1)  The small brass "needle valve" type screw on the top of the throttle
body, between the air intake manifold and the air intake. It has an "o" ring
on it.  Is this an idle adjustment?  Mine was backed out all the way, and
would have fallen out if not for the recessed fitting in the body.

2)  Behind the "grill" on the extreme left side of the car, there's a piece
of duct type hose (looks like heater box hose from 911) approx. 2-3" in
diameter which is clamped to a black plastic piece which looks like an air
intake.  This is mounted on the nose piece, outside of and slightly above the
air "scoop" for deflecting air toward the brake rotor. The other end (plain
hose) is laying across the control arm and up against the steering rack, just
sort of pointing upward, toward the turbo.  Where did this used to go?
