>Do you want to know how Porsche 911 GT1 racing teams qualified for
>tomorrow's FIA-GT race, or the finishing results of today's major GT race,
>anywhere in the world? Are you interested in the hourly standings for the
>24 Hours of Le Mans? Or, during the "off-season," do you want to know about
>Porsche's plans for the upcoming year of GT racing? If so, you need to
>visit the internet web site, SPORTSCAR WORLD
><http://www.pavilion.co.uk/sportscar-world/> for the latest GT racing news.
>And when you do, you'll be greeted by the Blue Coral Porsche Team's
>mid-engined 911 GT1 which is campaigned in the BRDC Privilege Insurance GT
>Championship, the national GT racing series in England.
>
>The web site, SPORTSCAR WORLD, was created in March 1996 as a result of
>Malcolm Cracknell's passion for sports and GT racing. The BRDC Privilege
>Insurance GT Championship -- with the support of the series sponsor -- is
>given extensive coverage, with detailed race reports and a monthly
>newsletter containing the latest team news.
>
>The Le Mans 24 Hour race receives full coverage of Pre-Qualifying and the
>whole of race week; the race itself is reported by means of a race bulletin
>updated throughout the 24 hours with all the incidents and changes in the
>leaderboard.
>
>The FIA GT Championship receives complete listings of all qualifying times,
>a race report and full results for every entry. Photographic coverage is
>provided of British races. A plan is evolving to provide photographic
>coverage of all the FIA races in 1998.
>
>World GT News is updated weekly to bring race results from other
>championships and all important developments in GT racing. The Blue Coral
>Porsche Team and Cirtek Motorsport (Saleen Mustang entrants) use the
>SPORTSCAR WORLD site to keep team sponsors and enthusiasts informed about
>their successes on the track, while Millennium Motorsport (Marcos entrants)
>have now placed their internet site on SPORTSCAR WORLD.
>
>Bookmark the address <http://www.pavilion.co.uk/sportscar-world/> and keep
>in touch with Porsche racing, worldwide.
