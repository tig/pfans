They are not jacking points. However, until I was told otherwise I used them
and never bent anything. Others have apparently not been so fortunate. I'd say
only use them in an emergency.

Cut some 12" lengths of 2"x12" lumber (or whatever the metric equivalent is
in your part of the world) with a 30-degree bevel on one end. Place one in
front of each wheel and drive the car up on them. This will allow the floor
jack to get under the central jacking point.
