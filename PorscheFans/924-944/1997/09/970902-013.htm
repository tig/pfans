Since the 'repair' of the last porschefans message deluge, no one from
Glaxo has been able to post to the list.  Actually, no one I know from
the Raleigh area has been able to post.  
 
I can't figure out how to remove the cam pulley, which will prevent me from 
removing the cam to adequately clean the ground up plastic out of the cam 
holder oil galleries.

For an '86 951, does anyone know any magic tricks for removing the 
camshaft pulley retaining bolt?  I have tried the conventional approach:

Securing the hexagonal pulley fitting with a box end wrench while TRYING
to loosen the triple-square retaining bolt with a socket wrench.  After
putting a 4 foot cheater bar on the socket wrench I succeeded in twisting
the Lisle triple-square tool approximately 90 degrees before it 'cammed'
out of the non-turning retaining bolt head.  This did some damage to the
retaining bolt head.  I now have a new KD triple-square tool, but I fear
the bolt head is only up for one more try (at best).

I'm considering using an impact driver (after bracing the pulley and/or
replacing the camshaft loading plate with a steel strap) after heating
the whole assembly in an oven to expand the metal.  Is there any way 
to get penetrating oil down to the bolt threads?  Any ideas out there?

I really have to disassemble the cam shaft/cam carrier/lifters in order 
to remove ground up pieces of plastic balance shaft counterweight 
fairing which have infiltrated my lubrication system.
