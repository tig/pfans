Does anyone know what the average cost of having a set of four aluminum
wheels refinished at rennsport? Also my wheels are not the fully polished
type, can rennsport polish them to a mirror like finish? Is there any other
shops out in the midwest that anybody knows about? Thanks.    Mike Bruestle

    If you have the time and a place to do it you can buff your own wheels
for about $80.00.  There are a number of wheel refinishing kits available. 
This makes a nice project for those who store their car in the winter. 
(Iowa)  I am doing mine and they look great and you can decide for yourself
just what finish you want.

other ramblings

I recieved my plates for my vehicles  today....for my van the number was
944,  my Nissan was 945 and  my Porsche plate was 946 .... the nice lady
behind the counter would not even discuss trading them.

the other day I saw a comment from someone about a Audi 924 and "owning one
was punishment enough"  Maybe we should start a Jr. High Porsche page so
the twelve year olds have a place to send their comments and save our
bandwith for people who have constructive comments.
