|Yes, the growing truck population is a rising cause of concern.  In one =

|week I had my windshield cracked by a rock and two nails in one of my=20
|rear tires.  Since most passenger cars are not used to carry rocks and=20
|construction fasteners it is easy to place the blame on the utility=20
|vehicles.
|
|In addition to the debris, the roads are deteriorating at an ever=20
|increasing rate.  The federal government estimates that poor roads are=20
|responsible for 4.7 billion (yes, Carl, that's billions and billions)=20
|dollars of vehicle damage each year in the US.  That's more than three=20
|time the amount of federal money spent on road repair.  Most of the=20
|highway funds go to new roads, not repair.
|
|A study in the state of Michigan revealed that trucks were responsible=20
|for high 90% of all the road damage.  Cars were found to have a=20
|negligible effect on the road surface.
|
|If I am not mistaken, most commercial vehicles do not have to answer to =

|federal and state emission standards.  While many of us struggle with=20
|passing local emissions I have seen too many trucks launch with a plume =

|of heavy black smoke smoke in such concentrations that only the Space=20
|Shuttle can best.  During the first and second wars, many generals =
would=20
|have given their right arm for such a formable smoke screen if not to=20
|have an excuse not to have to salute so many times.
|
|Although truck drivers are professional, and yes they do make mistakes, =

|they have a good safety record as a whole.  On the flip side, =
frustrated=20
|car drivers make for a nearly impossible situation by weaving and =
cutting=20
|in and out of the path of these trucks expecting those trucks to=20
|decelerate at rates that violate the laws of physics.  To the best of =
my=20
|knowledge, I have yet to see a single Big Bang Trooper issue a =
Universal=20
|citation.
|
|As truck traffic increases, I can only hope that a resurgence of the=20
|freight train brings relief.  As a Porsche owner, I truly believe that=20
|the only thing worse than driving with trucks is having to drive one. =20
|
|If truck population were to shrink, we would have to consider the the=20
|ramifications.  No longer would there be enough jobs for truckers.  =
Match=20
|book covers would have to be changed to offer these ousted workers new=20
|employment opportunities.  Imagine opening up a pack of matches and=20
|delighting in the exciting offer of a career change from lowly trucker =
to=20
|a nuclear technician.  Now that's a big 10-4 good buddy!
|
|Still, we have only ourselves to blame.  We have become a society bent =
on=20
|"getting it there yesterday".  With the passing of next day deliveries =
we=20
|have now graduated to same day deliveries.  On that note, as I write,=20
|scientists are busy working to unlock the secrets of time itself in an=20
|effort to break the "same day delivery" service record.  The new =
service,=20
|called Tachion Express, will enable shippers to get the package to you=20
|before you call!  The technology goes something like this:
|
|A large mass, probably a huge collection of soot and spent recap rubber =

|tires, is compressed into a small sphere.  The sphere is then sent into =
a=20
|rapid spin with the circumference spinning somewhere near the speed of=20
|light.  Packages are sent along the "event horizon" created by the=20
|spinning mass in a retrograde direction.  Receivers at the other end of =

|the temporal continuum collect the packages and transport them, at=20
|leisure, to their intended destinations.  The package arrives before =
the=20
|customer's requests reaches the shipper.
|
|If packages are passes around the "event horizon" in the opposite=20
|direction, it is still possible to have a "late" delivery.  This would =
be=20
|done from time to time just to keep from getting bored with a perfect=20
|record.  The human race still runs backward every now and then.
|
|As I continue to wrench on my car in an attempt to breath life back =
into=20
|its soul, I find myself ordering parts with next day delivery.  I set=20
|into motion a chain of events that sparks truck drivers scrambling from =

|there ready rooms like fighter pilots.  They quickly go over their =
check=20
|lists,  Instruments are monitored, mission plans evaluated, and crack=20
|teams of support personnel are mobilized into action.  Engines kick to=20
|life and belch clouds of smoke.  The smell of diesel fuel fills the =
air. =20
|The gates swing wide and out pours an army of trucks with their engines =

|screaming.  The morning dew glistens like a blanket of diamonds as the=20
|multitude of heads lights wash over them.  "I love the smell of diesel =
in=20
| the morning", cries one of the dispatchers as he draws from his =
favorite=20
|cigar.
|
|  The irony is many of these parts I am replacing met their demise due =
to=20
|trucks.  It is a self feeding situation.
