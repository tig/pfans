This is true.  What Kevin did was to make up exactly the tool that the 
workshop manual prescribes.  You cut about a 30 mm deep section off one 
end of a fuel filter, pop a tire valve into where the fitting was, 
replace the air flow meter in the intake tract with this pressurization 
jig, and put about 0.5 bar into the intake tract with the valves 
closed.

You can then go hunting either with soapy water (visual) or a length of 
PVC tubing stuck in yer ear (aural).

 Hi, Ken,

Two methods:

1) While the engine is running (and idling poorly), spray some silicone 
spray lubricant at the injector seals, or
wherever you think that you might have a vacuum leak. If the engine 
surges when you spritz it, then you have a
leak there...

2) Seal the intake manifold with some type of cover and pressure the 
intake area and listen for hissing. A soapy
water mixture might cause bubbles at the leak... (Actually, I heard 
from Kevin Gross that he was successful doing
this on his 944S and curing an intake leak...)

|Anyone have an easy/efficient way to check for vacuum leaks? I think
