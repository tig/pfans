Subject: re: PS fluid leaking

Before going after the updated line, simply replace the two sold hose 
clamps on the fittings at the base of the reservoir, with Zebra clamps. 
They are available from Porsche as p/n 999.512.346.02 and 
999.512.450.02.  More often than not, these more-flexible clamps solve 
the problem.  The P/S line is, to my recollection, an expensive item.

Dear Kevin & P-Fans
	One tip I would make for any power steering leaks/repairs. If you have
experienced a steering rack failure - would to replace the PS Reservoir. The
reservoir has a filter built into the inner  base of it, this filter will get
clogged with metal particles (or over time) from the old steering rack
debris. This filter gets clogged with particles - and at high RPM's causes a
restriction inside of the reservoir, until the screw/cap/lid's - safety valve
blows PS fluid out of the top of the reservoirs cap. The PS fluid gets
sprayed all over the top of the resivoir - it took me a awhile to figure out
where the fluid was getting there. I would recommend to replace the reservoir
if you have had a rack failure in the past or just as a preventative
maintenance.
	 I have noticed that 968's have a cool see-through clear upper half/shell
housing to the reservoir. Not sure on how much the 968 one costs, but I paid
$45 for the original ZF-Reservoir. 

                              DJ.
