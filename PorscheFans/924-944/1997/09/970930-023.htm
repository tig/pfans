Hey guys,

I just got my rebuilt speedo the other day. When I went to put it
in, I encountered a problem. There is a little circuit board that
bolts to the back of the speedo and has two wires that run over to
the tach. It's just a sensor of some sort, a resistor and a diode.
The problem is that my new-to-me speedo will not accept this same
circuit board. There is a place for a similar "thing" but the one
I have definitely won't fit. Anyway, I just took the thing out
completely and put everything else back together. Guess what: it
works! Everything works fine. So, here are my questions: What is
this thing? Is it a reference for the cruise? (I haven't tried
that yet). Will the "proper" one for my new speedo just drop in?
Am I hurting anything by driving around without it? I'd appreciate
any info you could provide.

Oh yeah, one other thing. When I first took this area apart six
months ago, I lost some lights. The tach is out and the bottom
half of the multi-gauge. The bulbs look good, and I can't find any
cables I forgot to re-hook up. I also don't see any dead fuses.
Has anybody experienced this phenomenon? This isn't related to the
above problem, since the lights were out when the "thing" was still
installed. BTW, I guess it matters that mine is an early car with a
cable-driven speedo.

Thanks,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White
