Hello Porschephiles,

I don't know if anyone has ever posed this question to the group, so here =
goes.

My '87 944 N/A 98k has a problem when it rains. =
The hatch on my car works great, doesn't  squeak or rattle, but when it =
rains or snows, the drains located below the hatch pins must overflow (=
being just little cups/reservoirs). Guess where the water ends up at? You =
guessed it, THE BRAKE LIGHT ASSEMBLY. I've cleaned the hoses which were =
already clear and the reservoirs which were also clear. The hoses  drain =
out the bottom rear of the storage compartments, but I think the whole =
system can't handle a lot of water. My garage has recommended that I drill =
some small holes in the otter side of the brake light lenses but I don't =
want to do something like that to a perfect Lens. The water only ends up =
in the brake light cone/assembly it doesn't go anywhere else such as the =
reverse light or the other markers ( some ends up in the car itself).  =
This seems like a small problem but I can't stand cleaning the lenses out =
one more time and this frequently. Can anyone tell me if they have had a =
similar problem, and what is a good solution. =

I haven't done my clutch job yet. I did, however, take the car on a 1500 =
mile trip to the Carolinas -no problems. What a great car on a long road =
trip...  Great gas mileage... 29mpg


BTW, in July I wrote the group asking for info on clutches. Everyone who =
responed was very cool and had great advice. Well I'm ready to do the job =
next month so I have more questions:

Jim Richmond e-mailed with info for me to talk to Jason at Paragon =
Products about a Turbo Cup clutch. =
I think I'm going with an OEM rubber center but does anyone have Jason's =
number at Paragon?

Barry Lenoble wrote me with invaluable info and tips and stated a good =
price on OEM clutchesless than $500 (more like $375) from IMHO, I can't =
find them on the net or a Porsche directory, can someone help.

Car info:
1. US - Pittsburgh, PA
2. '87 944 1 year old to me -  "Try to catch me Red", black interior, 1 =
owner from MD(great shape), 94K Miles _ $8,000
3. $ 1.50 per US gallon 93 octane
4. $775 insurance with theft/no-fault expensive Pennsylvania insurance =
multiple car/homeowners discount
5. $40+ per hour at my Porsche/BMW/Mercedes specialist - NEVER talked to a =
dealer in town $80per though, their mechanics chevy cavilers, (how would =
they know about the essence of a Porsche?)
 =
