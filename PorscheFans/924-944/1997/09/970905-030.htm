     The 90 reading is not good.  The others are probably ok.  You also 
     need to check each cylinder with and without oil squirted into each 
     cylinder.  The differances will indicate valve or gasket/ring 
     problems.
     
     When I purchased a used engine from a Porsche shop they did a "leak 
     down test" rather than a compression test.  Although I did not ask 
     specifics I assumed they pressured up each cylinder and after some 
     specified time checked the pressure and calculated the percentage of 
     pressure loss.  Mine checked at 94% or greater on a used engine with 
     nearly 100K miles, Try to get that from your Chev or Ford bucket.
     
     8:1 compression ratio is the relationship between the volume of the 
     cylinder at BDC and TDC.  In the early days, (late 60's) compression 
     ratio was increased to increase horsepower, with the advent of turbos 
     the ratio seems to have dropped.  I suspect that the added volume of 
     fuel/air that is forced in has a greater increase in hp than more 
     compression.
