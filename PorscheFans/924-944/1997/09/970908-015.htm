The above paragraph is a generalization, and for most cases, a true one.
But, with the right information, you can have both serious and booming bass
in the same small enclosure.  The trouble is finding the right driver and
the right person who is willing to take the time to do the math and figure
out the best box perameters for your style.

First, get yourself some catalogs from speaker houses.  I use Madisound
quite a bit.  They buy directly from the speaker manufacturer and sell to
the public.  You would not believe the number of manufacturers that do not
build their own drivers, i.e. Kicker, Pioneer, Orion etc.  They buy them and
put their name on it (and of course, increase the price).

Back to the subject.  There is some good computer programs out there that
will take the driver perameters and help you design the box using many of
the different calculation methods and then give you pretty accurate respnse
graphs to compare.  As an example, I purchased a Madasound (polydax) 1052DVC
10" dual voice coil sub driver for $39USD, designed a ported enclosure
approx 24x11x6 outside dimensions, ported, with a 16.75" port 3" in
diameter.  The curve runs flat to 38Hz with a -3db at 27Hz.  I am running a
Kenwood dedicated Subwoofer Mono amp at 150 watts, with both sides of the
driver in parallel to give me a rated 2ohm load.

To put it in english, I have a single 10" driver that BOOMS on the dance
music, but is wonderfully tight and accurate on my jazz and classical, and
yet does not take up much room.

Feel free to e-mail me if you would like to discuss this further and I could
help design a box for you.

Here are a couple of good speaker wherhouses:
