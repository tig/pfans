Hi Guys,

Need to repair a little undercoating abrasion inside the wheel well and
have some questions:

Is Wurth undercoating is available in anything but black?  I called Imparts
and they only have black. On my Alpine White car the factory undercoating
is white and the color is throughout the coating, not just painted on. If
black is all there is I'll end up spraying it with body color unless
someone has a better idea.

Also Imparts sells the Wurth undercoating in two forms, aerosol and liquid.
The liquid form requires a special air gun attachment to clamp on the can
and is supposed to produce a texture closer to the what the factory put on.
The air gun attachment is $40 and I doubt I'll use it more than once.
I only have about a 6"x12" section to cover but want it to look right. Does
anyone have any experience with the results from the two different kinds?

Finally, any words of wisdom for undercoat application?

Thanks in advance,

Doug
