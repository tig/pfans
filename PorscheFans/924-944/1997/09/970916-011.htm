John-

I have a similar car, and had a similar problem, though it was more of a 
gradual thing than an abrupt condition.  After trying variations on the 
above, I replaced my injector seals (the ones down inthe manifold get fairly 
warm and dry out over time).  This got rid of a lot of strange noises (this 
was at about 205Kmiles), and removed a stumble the car exhibited when cold.  
It is also a cheap fix (watch out for the ball in the fitting at the end of 
the fuel rail if you opt to drain excess fuel fromt the rail during this 
procedure; it will roll plenty far if you let it get awaay).

A while later I noticed that the noise was back, though the stumble was not. 
 After thinking about it for a while (ie- much procrastination) I bought a 
new intake gasket and popped off the intake.  Sure enough, there was a 
section of gasket which had failed (!) on the upper edge of the #1 port.  I 
replaced the gasket (at about 225K miles) and was doing very well until my 
girlfriend had a little oversteer problem last weekend and totaled the poor 
thing.

This is as good an excuse as any to mention this:
If anyone is looking for anything 85.5 944, black interior, 7V transaxle 
(cooler, ltd slip, and high 5th), suspensio chuncks, phone dials, etc, 
please call.  At this point everything but the sport seats can go.
