In the olden days when I was doing suspension work on Camaros and Corvettes 
we used to get swaybar bushings that were polyethylene (or something like 
that) that did not allow as much mush in the suspension parts.  These were 
ordered from the Chevrolet Power catalog and placed on all swaybar and 
shock attach points.  Anything like that for the 944/951???  These were 
yellowish in color and really felt like a hard plastic.  They did a good 
job of stiffening up the suspension although their life was limited by how 
hard you drove.

Thanks!
Mark
