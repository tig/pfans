The various "solutions" to the front end shake on a 84 944 don't add up to
much. The fact is that the early models with the Rabbit A-arms are very
sensitive to tire defects. My own 84 bought new shook for the first 6000
miles while trying all the latest hot ideas including on the car balancing.
All a waste of time. It was the German Dunlop rags that were original
equipment. Better they should have been nailed on the bow of a tugboat. When
I replaced them with Yoko A008's (hot tire at the time) the problem
disappeared and has never come back. The car has been wearing a set of much
hated Re-71's since '88 and still has no balance or shake problems. I'd toss
these too if I could ever get any reliable advice about what's best now,
considering road noise, tramlining, etc.

As to Wes Shew's uneven brake pad wear,  been there, done that. I don't know
if the S2 has floating rear calipers, but if it does, the problem is that
they aren't floating any more. The very small sliding surface is mucked up
with brake pad dust and dirt preventing the caliper from moving sideways.
Just swing the caliper down and clean the area and it's back to normal. It
took me a while to figure this out, having relied at  first on expert advice
which led nowhere but cost a bit. My problem was that the opposite rear wheel
was locking up under hard braking at the track since the stuck caliper had
only half it's braking power. No ABS on the old crocks, remember.

I'm still laughing about a concours judge who would deduct points for a
misaligned (he thought) wheel cap crest. This better damn well not be
happening at a National PCA Concours. The PCR Concours rules don't call for
such a foolish penalty. The only way this could be done is if the cap was
originally installed that way. And, it wasn't.

One last thing, my '84 944, (just passed 40K miles)  a factory delivery car
14 years and ten days in my possession, has had an Autothority chip in it for
about ten years with noticeably good results and no related problems. Lots of
track time, BTW. It also has Cibie 90/135W H4's and I can say that relays are
absolutely necessary. Even with the stock headlights there was almost a 1.5
volt drop at the headlights. Now it's zero. Anybody who says they are using
bulbs like this without relays with "no problems" will soon have them. 

This is as good a place as any to remind PCA members that the National PCR
Committee is meeting on Nov. 2 to review possible rule changes for the '99
Parade plus additions for '98 such as classing the 996 in Concours and
Autocross. Your Regional Presidents and Zone reps have been notified and
asked for inputs from the members which are due by the middle of October. The
reason this is important is that many Regions around the country use the
PCR's as a base for Regional rules, especially Concours. So, you shouldn't
ignore the PCR's which are really aimed at Parade Competition. I've been on
the Committee for 14 years and am looking forward to this year's meeting in
New York.
