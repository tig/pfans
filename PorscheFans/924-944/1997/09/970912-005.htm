I also had the stuttering problem, and I also went through a new
air-flow meter needlessly, which is now for sale, BTW.  I had my car
"timed" by a local shop 3 times before I finally took it to someone who
knew what they were doing.  Timing a 944S involves "make-them-yourself
extensions" for your feeler gauges and special holding jigs.  It would
appear that the cams were out of my car at some point in the past, and
had been laid back into the engine at an improper orientation, ie. they
were "off a tooth".  The correct clearance between the cam lobes is
113mm, and mine were 101mm.  After the car was timed correctly, the car
stopped all that sputtering at low RPMs, and had what I would consider
serious torque between 4000 and 6600 RPM.
