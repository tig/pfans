      My seat covers (black with red inserts) are about three months old
and I still love them.  Remember, as I originally posted, if you don't
specify otherwise, they will come with the "Wet Okole" logo plastered on
the headrest which I thought was less than totally desirable (they did
replace them for next to nothing, however).  There was some mention made at
the time of the possibility that they would put a porsche logo on for some
additional $.  I will admit that I was not brave enough to cut a slit in
them for the seat release, but now that I read it can be done I intend to
attack them today with razors.
