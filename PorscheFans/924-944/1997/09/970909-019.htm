 As for mid-life crisis, I am currently working on my 4th one.  Remind your
wife of her friend's rodent husband who went off to find himself with some
bimbo.  Point out you just want the Porsche not the bimbo.  It is an iron
clad guarantee that Porsche maintenance costs are far less than the cost of
a divorce. Your wife will sleep like a rock and you can spend all your
waking hours tinkering with and polishing you car.

[J. Dean Roberson]  OK Jim, we're dying to know....
What were MLCs 1&2?
I hope they were cars.  P-cars to be specific!
