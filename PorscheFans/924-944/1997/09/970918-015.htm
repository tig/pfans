Greg R mentioned replacing his panel between the two headlights due to an
"event" with another car while parked in the street.

If possible, (and if you are comfortable doing it) I would have the part
repaired rather than replaced.  This is an area that you can feel comfortable
using repair material (not bondo but similar) to fix the dent.

You can remove the panel and pound it out with a hammer close to the original
lines.  Sand the area to clean metal, fill in with repair material and sand
smooth.  Paint with an epoxy primer (can be made available in an aerosol) and
then finish with paint.

Or, remove the panel, bring it in to a body shop and have them repair the
damage.  Re-mount the panel on the car and bring it to a great paint shop and
have them match the paint.  Where your damage is, it will be very hard to paint
just the damaged panel, it will probably have to be blended into the adjacent
panels.  Total for others doing the job for you should be about $200.00
reparing vs $500.00 or so replacing parts.

I had a truck throw a rock onto my headlight cover and dent it big time.  I did
procedure #1 and it looks great.  Total cost was about $20.00 for the paint.
