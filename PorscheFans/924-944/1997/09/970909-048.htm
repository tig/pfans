To whomever needed the Wet Okole phone number, their website
is www.wetokole.com. The phone numbers are on there. All the
people were very cool to deal with.

As far as my covers are concerned, they are great! I ended
up getting black with brown inserts (my interior is brown).
It looks better than it sounds (and much better than the
ripped-to-shreds look hiding underneath!). I feel like I'm
driving a new car. Just the friction between the new
material and my clothing keeps me from sliding around so
much. I'm very glad I bought 'em.

One thing, though. I didn't realize it until the things came
in, but you have to cut a little slit in the covers for the
release lever on the side of each seat. This was a little
unnerving considering the cost of the things, but it's easy
if you're careful. Also, you must remove the seats for a
proper installation. I just don't see a way around it. Of
course, I stripped out one of the bolts on the driver's side.
Damn!
