I was replacing one of the sun roof lift arm mechanisms today and noticed
that the lubricant on both arm assemblies was very dry and caked (and did
not have much in the way of lubricating properties based on how hard it was
to move the drive cable when disconnected from the motor).  The original
unit had the cable break within one of the lift arm boxes.  A close up look
at this failure revealed fatigue as  the likely culprit (probably due to
excessive loading while pushing the arm up).  

I took the covers off both lift arm boxes, cleaned out all of the old
grease and then applied new wheel bearing grease to all sliding surfaces
(including the cable and cable guide).  (small areas of excess original
grease looked very much like typical amber colored, transparent wheel
bearing grease).  Upon reassembling the lift arm boxes, it was obviously
much easier to to move the arm in and out by hand.  It was also much, much
easier to move the drive cable and actuate the whole sun roof assembly by
hand.  

Moral of the story:  ignore the factory shop manual's warnings to not
remove the covers of these components.  I suggest you do and relubricate
them to prevent cable or other part failures due to lack of lubrication.  I
wish I had a few years ago.  Working on the sun roof drive is not
especially fun.
