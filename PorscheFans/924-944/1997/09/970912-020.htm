Hey!  The blonde is back.

Well after too much time, we have finally decided the overheat problem
is a bad radiator fan motor.  My estranged husband, who is really a gem
in the rough, diagnosed the problem after assessing the symptoms while
driving it one afternoon.  Checked out the fans and determined the only
fan working was the A/C fan and that the main unit was bad.

Sooo, I tootle on in to my "reputable" Porsche shop last Wednesday and
request they order a main radiator fan motor and schedule shop time for
the following Friday.  When I bring `baby' in, they tell me, no they
have not ordered the part I requested, as they know much more than I or
my "shade tree" mechanic do.  "It could be several things" they say and
proceed to charge me $100.00 bucks I don't have (temporarily between
opportunities) to tell me what I already know... the main radiator fan
motor is bad, and... they drain the battery in doing it.  Great!  Then
they tell me they will put together an estimate for the repair and get
back to me.  Well boys it's been over a week and sitll no estimate.

Then I remember, while I'm sitting there waiting for my car work to be
done,  I hear them tell a 924 owner they prefer not to work on 924 or
944 cars.  They only specialize in 911's and Audi's but they will take a
look (and your money) and decide if the car is worthy of their finely
trained mechanics attention.  I'm serious...  Well, screw you too.  I
order the part myself and it gets installed by another shop on Monday. 
This is my only vehicle guys and I have been driving it to job
interviews on a wing and a prayer with the heat on high or the A/C on to
keep it from overheating.  Hopefully, that will fix the overheat
problem.  One damn thing is for sure, I won't be going back to "Mr.
Puffed Up" at 911's R Us again, ever.

I still have the damn hard start problem or at least it has reared its
very ugly head, AGAIN.   I replaced the DME relay, the ignition switch,
installed new ground straps to the chassis and block, but it still, from
time to time, won't start always after driving it somewhere.  I'm now
wondering if I need to replace the battery since it has been drained
several times, most recently by "Mr. Puffed Up" and his finely trained
mechanics.  The car did sit for several months over the winter not being
used before I bought it?  It seems to me that I had this problem the
last time the battery was drained and once it became charged up again
the hard start problem went away, but I just can't remember.  I'm a
blonde, you unerstand?

Details...  When it won't start, there is no movement in the Tachometer
while I'm cranking and I know not to keep cranking cause it just ain't
gonna start.  "Mr. Puffed Up" sez that indicates its a problem in the
primary ignition system.   Funny thing is though, if I lift the hood and
leave it open for 5 or 10 minutes (sometimes longer) the tach movement
returns on the crank and it starts right up?  WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?

Any ideas?  I have had 'baby' for close to two months and I just want to
drive it somewhere, know it will start and not overheat on the way.  H E
L P... I am but a poor, temporarily unemployed, blonde person, with her
nose pressed up against the glass of Porsche paradise.  My hood is up
and gaping for everyone to see and it's all just too humiliating.  You
know the drill, the thinly veiled snickers as they smuggly motor on by
in their reliable "niponeze" boxes.  I am at my WITZEND (which is the
name of my band, by the way) and its all just too much to handle alone. 
I am at your mercy porschefans!

I'm a blonde, you understand?
