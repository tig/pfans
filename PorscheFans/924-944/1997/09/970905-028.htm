Well, not exactly a 4x6.  While replacing a door stop last weekend
I noticed my ft door speakers were basically shredded. I replaced 
them with a pair of Infinity 3.5 inches from Crutchfield.  I got 
them a day later, only cost $50, came with an adapter plate that
fit perfectly, installed in 5 mins/door and sound great. So while
others are driving around with bad speakers while waiting for the
perfect 4x6 solution, I'm down the road with my CD player blazing...

tho I'm keeping my eyes open to the "rear speaker" thread...
