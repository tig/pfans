Nick,

It seems to be pretty much an unwritten law that a wife/girlfriend will lie
like a dog when it comes to timing a spouse/boyfriend. The guy you ran away
from while turning 1:35's will get a report from the SO that he was turning
1:29's. Do they do that to keep the loved one from pushing harder or what?
