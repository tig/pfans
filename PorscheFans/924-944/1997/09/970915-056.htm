Hi there,

To keep it brief, last week the Sports Car Club of America held its 25th
annual Solo-2 Nationals in Topeka, Kansas.  Winning in A-Stock was Jeff
Reitmeir in his 944S2, Followed by Matt Murray in his 968, then assorted
BMW M3s, Toyota MR2 Turbos, more big water pumpers, etc.

In C-Stock, (the other water pumper class) Tim Aro came in second, Rich
Fletcher fourth, and Glen Hernandez fifth, all in 1988 924S/M030 cars.
First and third were taken by 1991 non-turbo MR2s.  Seven 924S cars and
some 944s joined the newly reformulated C-Stock.  It was a good showing for
the marque, with three of the top five trophies.

All in all, SCCA Solo-2 program (autocrossing) is turning out to be a
pretty good racing venue for the front pumpers.  Come out and play sometime.

title sponsor.)
