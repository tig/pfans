Here are some tricks that allowed Paul and I to be more competitive in
autocrossing this year:

1. When waiting in the starting line, keep the engine running, DO NOT
   SHUT IT OFF.  Remember, it takes exhaust pressure AND heat to spin
   that turbine.  The colder the exhaust, the less boost can be created.
   If the exhaust is only luke warm, the max I've been able to get in 1st
   is 12psi, and usually it's 10psi.  By the time you shift into 2nd, the
   exhaust should be hot enough to get up to 14psi.  If it's nice and
   hot and the coolant is hot, the car will be able to produce an
   easy 15psi in 1st gear.

2. Drag your brakes up to the start line, you'll need all the heat you
   can get.

3. Learn how to launch your 944T, it's worth 1-2 seconds on a run.
   If done properly, no undue stress should be placed on the car.
   Learn to spin the tires, not the clutch, and even then, the tire
   spinning should be only for a few rotations.  Learn on something with
   a cheap clutch :)

4. Fill the gas tank full, unless you really like power-on oversteer.
   With the wonky boost chips I have, my car is almost uncontrollable with
   an empty tank on street tires.

5. Make sure your compressor bypass valve is operational.  I disconnected
   mine to know what it feels like if and when it goes bad.  The first
   time you apply throttle, there is no difference, but the second time
   when you get off it and on it quickly, the boost is not there and it
   has to build it again, think slalom, think on and off, think you are
   losing time if that cheap part is not working, not to mention the extra
   stress you've put on the turbo.

6. If you have stock suspension, huck the car around the course.  You'll
   be surprised with the results.  While being smooth is essential, getting
   the car over to the Apex as soon as possible is even more important.
   Because of the soft suspension, fast "jerky like" actions feel like you
   are being jerky and therefore slow.  Wrong.  You need to get the car
   to take a set as quickly as possible, throw the car through the course
   and videotape your run.  From the outside, it looks like you are smooth
   as glass, but inside, you feel like a hack.  The only difference is your
   time will be much faster when you throw the car around a little.  If you
   have modified your suspension to make it stiffer, the car will take a set
   faster and you do not have to manhandle the car as you will automatically
   become more aggressive as you get more comfortable.  I watched a video
   clip of a 924 being driven by Hans Stuck and couldn't believe what
   he could make that car do.  I tried the hucking method the next auto-x
   and we haven't looked back since.  Remember, smoothness with aggression
   is the ultimate fast way through a course.

7. Plough is your enemy, set the car up twitchy in auto-x, it's faster
   than neutral.  I like a twitchy car on the track too if I have sticky
   tires.  If you are ploughing in an auto-x, next time around, make a
   special effort to slow down there.  Even though it feels like you could
   run faster around the cone, you'll likely drop 0.3-1.0 second off your
   run.

8. Steer with the rear.  Use the throttle at medium-high speed corners to
   get the car through the corner faster.  It also allows you to develop
   boost for the exit, which is very important.

9. With turbo cars, slow-in fast-out works.  Come in hard, but make sure you
   are on the throttle as soon as you are turning in.  You only really need
   to use trail-braking in some circumstances.  I know a lot of people use
   it for turning the car in, but that's what alignment is for.  All of the
   National calibre drivers I've been with have not used it except in very
   tight situations, it's much more important to get out of the corner
   with acceleration than to come into the corner harder.

10. Position yourself correctly in the seat, and sing a stupid song to 
    yourself before going for a run, it calms your nerves.  At the start
    line, before running, hit your chest twice, this gets the adreneline
    flowing, but be careful the first time you do it, both Paul and I spun
    when we tried it for the first time.

I've taken a risk by giving this info out;  there will definitely be people


who think I'm an idiot and that all I've written is wrong.  Take it for
what it's worth.  Paul and Darren both use advice like the above, and I 
feel that Paul is turning into a national calibre driver and Darren has
also shown some serious promise.  

When you take all these little things and add them up, it makes quite a
difference.

Happy autocrossing!
Farzaan.
