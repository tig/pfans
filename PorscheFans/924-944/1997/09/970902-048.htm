Dear Ed,
	Check the charcoal canister inside the left front fender between the wheel
and the door.  It is part of the EECS . Fuel vapor form the tank and fuel
injection system is stored here when the car is not in use.  If you turn
the wheels left to the stop, you should be able to see it without removing
the wheel.  They seem to separate where the bottom meets the sides of the
canister.

Good Luck,


Stu

'84 944 gold\brown(hit in the rear the day after the '85 clutch went bad) 
'85/1 944 black\black (waiting for clutch)
and now '86 924S [automatic :(  ] for parts
