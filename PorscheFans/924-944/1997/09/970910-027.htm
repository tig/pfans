During the Las Vegas race last weekend I had a sinking feeling that I was 
getting furthur away from the steering wheel.  I couldn't figure out how
this 
could be happening as the race seat is non adjustable and bolted securely
in. 
After the race I loaded the car in the trailer and flew home, leaving the 
trailer with my mechanic friend to be driven to So. Cal. in preparation for 
Willow Springs this weekend. 
 
My friend, checking the car over for this weekends race, noticed that the 
floor under the drivers seat was split open.  This occurred at the left rear=
 
mounting point for the drivers sear.  There is a pad with a nut welded in to=
 
bolt the seat to and the sheet metal around the pad was fatigued and cracked=
 
4-5 inches forward and across from the corner.  As a result, the seat had 
dropped below floor level by 1/2 inch or so. 
 
He has seen this condition on another 924S he owned and while checking out
his 
GT2S race car later that day he found the floor was similarly cracked around=
 
the same mounting point. The car is based on a 924S tub.  If you have an
early 
944 car or 924S, especially one that you track you might want to check this 
point for cracking.   
 
The solution is to stich weld the floor up and weld in additional sheet
metal 
plates to reinforce the area. 
 
Good info for the faq......
