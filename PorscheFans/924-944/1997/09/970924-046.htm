I have to let off a little steam...I'm pissed at the truckers who 
shred their rubber in the middle of the freeway. Twice in the last 
two weeks I've run over these slabs at night on my way home from work.
 The first time I had my underpan on but since that time I had 
removed it. I don't think anything was damaged tonight but I'm lucky 
it didn't rip off the power steering unit. Does anyone else share 
this gripe? Any damage? Would insurance cover any serious damage?

As a side note, last week I popped a racoon. I hit it square on the 
right fog light. Took out the lens completely. It was quite a show 
with glass flying in front of the headlights. At the time, though, I 
thought it was coon parts. Next time I won't steer away from it, I'll 
steer into it!
