the point is to find the spot between too mcuh tire spin and engine bogging.

DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION!

 there is a best fit curve that i am sure someone here knows, where HP and
Torque are similar, in the case of a 944 NA it is about 2350-2500RPM, this
is the point where the launch should come from.  the idea is NOT to drop the
clutch as this produces too much wheel spin but , UNFORTUNATELY, to ease the
clutch out (also known as slipping) until the car is moving slowly then to
drop the clutch and floor the gas.  there should be some tire spin but not
much (mainly because there is only 150HP to work with).  this is NOT
recommended daily driving procedure as it will EAT clutch (a european mag
ate a 993TT clutch in 3 weeks!!).  The idea, if you are not sure of where to
launch, is this; tires are throw away items, cluthces are not.  On a turbo,
my guess is you would want to be just below where the boost comes in this
way as soon as you dump the clutch the boost pressure is rising rapidly.
(farzaan probably knows best, i think he mentioned not being able to hurt
his baby doing this).  Just for reference, you WILL have to buy a new clutch
if you continually slip it.  One other point is too many 5000RPM launches
will eat trans. parts (read pinion gear, driveshafts, etc.)   To get an idea
of where you should launch you should do it a few times start with the low
RPM's and see how the car bogs, then move to the high one's and examine the
wheel spin.
