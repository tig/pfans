A grateful thanks to all of you who suggested solutions to my shimmy
problem.  The solution was the locking lug nuts.  As I had previously had a
full alignment done and had the wheels balanced multiple times, I went
straight to the locking nuts and put them adjacent to the stems as
suggested by several kind people. I also re-torqued the remaining nuts just
to be sure, and that was the end of the shimmy.  Jim

Dear PorscheFans:
	Thanks to all for the replies re: my query about 944S2 heads cracking. All the
owners were reassuring. One technician that I heard from (I e-mailed him
directly) corroborated the head cracking but neither of the two technicians
have been specific. 
	Anyway, on to the next step: Anyone have a recommendation for a
944-knowledgable shop which will do a pre-purchase inspection. One in the Rye,
NY area (the 944S2) and another near Chelmsford, MA (fallback position ;>))?

Regards,

Gary
