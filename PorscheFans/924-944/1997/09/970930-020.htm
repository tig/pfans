Clean the side of the head above the stamping on the block. If that gets
greasy with oil, you have a leaking cam tower gasket. If it doesn't, you
have a leaky head gasket. The oil feed for the head is in that general
area so it could be either but cam gaskets appear to be more likely.

Cam tower gasket is simple but you have to retension the cam belt to get
it back together right. That complicates things if you don't have access to
the belt tensioning gauge of the gods.

The Haynes book will cover R&R of the cam tower (and the head too if that
is the problem) but they don't do a good job talking about the belts.
