Hey,

I've often wondered why it seems that the turbochargers in diesel =
engines, especially diesel trucks, last so long whereas the average life =
of a turbo in a gasoline car is usually much less.  Is this a heat =
related issue?  Does a gasoline engine's turbo run that much hotter than =
the diesel?  How about RPMs of the turbo?

I know from experience with my Dad's trucking business that the =
turbochargers in the big trucks (Cummins 300's and Big Cam 350's) seem =
to last hundreds of thousands of miles.  Of course these turbos are =
twice as big as a KKK K26 turbo, but does that make a difference? (More =
area for heat dissapation? - More Oil flow?)  BTW, these turbos are not =
water cooled.

Another thing I've always noticed - trucker's *always* let there motors =
idle for several minutes at the beginning of the day before driving =
(Gotta build up air pressure), and at the end of the day when =
re-fueling.  And they run continuously all day.  These turbos are rarely =
allowed to be spinning fast without oil supply.  And they've got plenty =
of oil - 13 gallons plus an accumulator that feeds the turbo directly. =20

Anyhow - my guess is that it's just a matter of an over-designed =
lubrication system. ( And good maintainence. )  The 951 turbo seems well =
designed to me - plenty of oil and water.  It's got a water =
'accumulator' - the electric water pump :) - but no oil accumulator :(.

Just wondering.....
