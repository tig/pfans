Subject:question about 944 turbo

Hi there,

I have a question about 944 turbo. I am going to buy a 88 944 turbo but 
I am not sure if it is a turbo S . So how should I notice from the 
serial number? The other question is that: What is the main difference 
from turbo and turbo S? I know the suspension are difference but how 
about the turbo are they both using K-26? What make 30hp increase from 
turbo to turbo S? Should I buy a very good condition 88 turbo and make 
modification or I should buy turbo S ?
Please help!
Yours truly,
Barry Tam

	There is a Porsche Information Tech Book detailing the differences between
the two models, titled: "944 Turbo S" Information Technik, Part#WKD-495-021,
sells for $8.00 aprox 30 pages. I bought mine from "My-Porsche" on the Net.
There is also a neat "Tech-Spec Book" available that has all the technical
data for 951's: part#WKD-423-520, $8.00.

     The followingis what the book("944 Turbo S" Information Technik,
Part#WKD-495-021) states as the differences. Production is limited to 1,000
cars for 1988 model year.
	*Engine power 247 SAE HP
	*Sport running gear (M030)
*Stronger more powerful front brakes (simular to 928 S-4)
*manual trans w/stronger gears & limited slip
*Stronger clutch disc	 
*body paint in "Silver Rose Metalic" paint#P 823
	 color code F1F1
*Burgundy plaid interior cloth seats

The USA Turbo S cars have the folowing optional M-equipment as standard for
the Turbo-S.

M418 Protective side mouldings   M526 Door pannels in multicolor
M288 Headlight washers		  M437/438 Full power sears L&R
M030 Sport chassis		  M990 Full cloth seats
M593 ABS	   M490 Hi-Fi Sound pakage
M220 Limited slip diff.	   M454 Speed conrol/cruise
M685 Split rear seatback	   M650 removable elect/Sunroof
M425 Rear window wiper

	Here are my notes on the basic differences between the two models, for the
Turbo-S Model.
*Only avail in Rose Metalic for '88 MY (opional colors for"89 &up)
*Sport (read stiffer) suspension with adjustable spring perchases.
*7JX16 & 9JX16 Forged wheels with 225 & 245's tires
*Larger K-26 Turbo, max boost 1.82 bar absolute & differnt DME.
*Harder suspension bushings
*Reinforced front frame rails to the body shell (by the PS unit  	 
 and the coolant exp tank).
*Larger Brakes frt &rr with larger brake caliper pistons.


	Here ar some other interesting Porsche publications: 

944 Turbo Service Information technik '85 & up.
Porsche part #WKD-491-321.  I'm not sure it is still available?
  *gives detailed procedures for servicing the 951.

944 Turbo Service Information, DME &KLR Test Plan - technik '85 & up. Porsche
part #WKD-453-920. I'm not sure it is still available?
  *gives detailed pin-out test procedures for DME & KLR boxes.

I purchase all my stuff from My-Porsche, they seem to stock most of the high
volume stuff and are very pleasent to seal with. 

                HTTP:// WWW.MY-PORSCHE.COM

Also the PANORAMA, Up-Fixin der Porsche, Volume VII, covers the story of the
951 power plant and why Porsche used the materials and to what lengths
Porsche tested the powertrain. One case in point and charge air temp chart
befroe & after the intercooler, from 50 MPH to 175 MPH!!! A Great Read!
 Aprox $18 avail from PCA.
