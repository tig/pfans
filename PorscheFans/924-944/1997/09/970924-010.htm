Juha asks about painting his car to cover up some cracking.  I might have a
couple of suggestions.  First, you will not be able to "cover up" the cracks in
the paint no mater how small they are.  You will have to either sand or apply
paint stripper to the area to remove the cracked paint first.  Paint will flow
into the cracked area if not sanded first.  It may look good initially but will
not look so good in a month's time.

You can go to an auto parts store that carries automotive paint (body shop
materials) and purchase the paint ( I recommend Sikkens) that will be a close
match to your car's color.  This way you are getting the 2 part acrylic enamel
paint that requires mixing and measuring prior to painting.  Then you can use a
paint gun and paint the area.  Or, you can have the paint made into an aerosol
at the auto parts store and paint your car that way.  They can also supply a
clear coat in an aerosol form if your car needs it.  You will also need a
primer before painting if you have used the paint stripper or sanded to bare
metal.  I would suggest an epoxy primer.

The paint will not exactly match the color on your car.  Due to the age of your
vehicle, the paint on the car has changed over time.  You can solve this
problem one of 3 ways. 1.  Have a professional paint the car.  2.   Use the
paint from  the auto parts store and spray a piece of sheet metal (with the
same primer on it as you are putting on your car) and bring this along with a
headlight cover (or some other easily removable part) from your car back to the
store and they can then tint the paint to match the color of you car.  The
third option is to paint the whole piece that has the cracks and not worry
about the match so much.  It is easier to paint a whole piece rather than
trying to blend in the new paint into the old paint.

Leonard asked about how to remove lug nuts without ruining the finish - I have
found that putting a baggie inside the socket works very well.  It is probably
not the best way but it does work well.  When the finish gets worn, it is easy
to re-paint with hardware store paint (flat black).  It is not stock but looks
as though it is.
