I had a funny expirence with my 951 yesterday.

I took the car to car washing washine (the tunnel automatic-one)
You know the one where you get bottom of the car washed as weel.

After the wash (on the road) I had a line-up with one of those Citroen
Saxo 16V, a rather fast little frenchmen.
He wanted to play with me......

I kicked his ass in first gear, and I wasent even doing full trottle. I
gave it second and gave it full power.
The turbo started building up the pressure, but when It almost had full
boost,
the boost somehow disapeard, I made a fast trip to 3 gear, and It did
the same - lost a lot of power, I also noticed some black smoke from the
exhaust. Every time the boost came up, it stopped again, It felt like
the turbo was doing it's job, but I't got no fuel.

I took it home - thinking the entire night - what had happen, it felt
somehow like an electrical failure, so i thought that some water had
come in somewhere, but where ??? Actually the best answer I could come
up with, was that the hose on the waste-gate had come loose cause of the
sprinklers in the wash.

I talked with my Porsche-dealer; and he told me that It's a regular
problem with the 951, when you take to a washing-tunnel, 
and the car is warm, offcourse the waste-gate is very hot. Then the cold
water is washing all over the bottom of the car, cooling down the
waste-gate housing, which make the valve goes stock. I mean I drove my
car home for few miles, and the problem was on the whole time. This
morning everything was back to normal, again, Thanks God !!!!

So what was the good thing about it (besides it's back to normal)

I think I lost about 100 HP, in the line of fire, But the frenchmen
never made it to the top. Cool !!!! 
I showed him !!!!!!!!!! 

Has anyone had the same experince ???, should I avoid the washing tunnel
?????
Does it sound fair, that the the wastegate valve stocks, Is that a
problem.?
