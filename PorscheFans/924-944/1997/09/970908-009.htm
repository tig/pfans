Hey,

To add to the chip replacement advice responses....

If you've got a turbo and are doing a Weltmeister or Dinan chip upgrade, =
a wastegate shim is required to be installed.  Just realize that the =
wastegate shim is a bear to install - take my word for it.  Might want =
to consider the Autothority upgrade if you're not inclined to =
disassembing your wastegate.  Most people don't automatically assume =
they will be *under* their car to do a chip upgrade.  Automotion doesn't =
reveal this little tidbit in their catalog - just multi-color torque/HP =
curves.

Just wanted to mention this as a warning since most people assume a chip =
upgrade just involves changing the chips out.  It's what the vendors =
*don't* tell you that get 'ya.  I'll never forget being in my unheated =
garage in February trying to remove the @#&! wastegate.  On the bright =
side, I have plenty of 3/8" drive ratchet extensions and universal =
joints now.

My $.02,

Dean
'87 951 - Weltmeistered with bad memories of wastegate shim =
installation.
