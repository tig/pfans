<pre>
have an 87 porsche 924S, when I was tooling down the road 40mph in 3rd
gear it suddenly sent a large amount of smoke out the tail end, I let
off the gas and it appeared to stop. I drove home, gingerly, and upon
checking the oil it was milky. I had just changed to synthetic the night
before and flushed filled radiator (burped it too) holy cow this looks
bad. Local shop said 700$ just to put head gasket on with extra charges
for ANYthing else that it may need,(machining, flush etc..) sounds bad.
Want to attempt myself but am told by Gunther (my brother) , (great
porsche racer) that a tensioner is needed and is very expensive. I am
very mechanicly inclined and have a moderate supply of hand tools . Need
more advice and information to take the best course of action. PLEASE
contact those who are the keepers of the knowledge.   ANDY  
.
