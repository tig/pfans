HELP!!!!! I am about to purchase my first Porsche. The choices are

1987 924S with 130K, good to great condition, 5spd, Supposedly dealer
serviced.

1984 944 with 130K, good condition, 5spd, no history.

-Both cars are same price and options.
-Both Cars have 1yr 12,000K warranty on the powertrain
-The seller (car lot) of 944 will service same vehicle at discount rate (in
writing).
-924 seems to have been kept cleaner than 944 but a little elbow grease and
 some TLC can remedy this problem.
-924 has no apparent squeaks or rattles, feels good and tight.
-944 has had timing belt and some other minor maintenance recently done.
-Plan to use vehicle daily, and all four seasons. (yes, even in the snow!
It's that or drive my wife's Mini-van.
 I still shutter when I say that word!!!)

I am not looking to set any land speed records and usually drive somewhat
defensively but how I do love the smell of burning rubber and doing the
"Blue By You" thing on occasion. It's better than that first cup of coffee
in the morning!!!

My dilemma, I want a car with a reliable history. I don't and can't afford
to spend more time in the shop than happily motoring along. I don't know a
lot about the history of either model as far as reliability or maintenance
costs go. Of course I would like to hop into the more prestigious of the
two models (which ever that is) but I'm trying to get my adrenaline to a
sane level and decide with my wallet and not my throttle foot. My wife, who
all the sudden has convinced herself that this is a mid-life crisis thing,
is having sleepless nights about what maintenance costs will be. I will
admit, she is starting to make me nervous. I know with any used car it is
kind of like playing Russian Roulette but I like to increase my odds of
having one shell in the cylinder instead of six. 

What I ask of any respondents:
WHICH CAR WOULD YOU LEAN TOWARDS IF THIS WERE YOU!!!
and any insight as to any tweaks I should be looking for? (good or bad)

Thank-you in advance to all who respond.
