>In the olden days when I was doing suspension work on Camaros and
Corvettes =

we used to get swaybar bushings that were polyethylene (or something like=

shock attach points.  Anything like that for the 944/951???  These were =

<

Mark,

The yellow/brown clear plastic is urethane.  They contribute a stiffer mo=
re
responsive feel to the suspension.  The downside is wear and noise.  I ha=
ve
seen them in a catalog (Automotion?) and will let you know if I run acros=
s
them.
