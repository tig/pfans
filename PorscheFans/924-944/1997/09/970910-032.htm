Under the car, both in the front and back, there are some round "things"
that look like they will fit the pad of the a hydraulic jack perfectly. But
are these really jack points? The owner's manual doesn't mention them, and
neither does Haynes, but I saw another guy here mention that he positioned
the jack stands under these points. I could do without embarassing comments
from passengers as to what that strange bump on the floor is..

As it is, I have a hydraulic jack with an adapter to make it fit in the jack
point under the door, but wouldn't you know.. The car is way too low for the
jack to get under. :/ The factory jack gets under, but it doesn't feel safe
enough for me to dare using it when placing the car on jack stands.
