Sorry to post this to the whole list, but I can't get the email address out
from reading the list off the web interface, so:

Mark wrote a few days back:

There is definitely something wrong there.  Perhaps the car already
had chips?  The car should feel much more responsive in the bottom end
and it should pull like a 10-ton truck rear ended you when you get on
it.  Did you figure this out already or are you still having the 
sluggish acceleration problem?  With turbocharged cars, when something
doesn't feel right, it's NEVER a good idea to keep on driving it that
way;  there are too many variables that could destroy your engine in
quick order to just ignore the problems.

The flat spot is generally normal with the boost bolt setup, but it should
not feel sluggish.  The boost bolt is the best method for beginners or
people who don't want to worry about reliability so I recommend for now
to stay with that setup.  The cup computers are quite expensive, but a few
list members have sourced them out.  One even managed to find the so-called
"head-gasket" computers which pump out over 300hp, but run so lean they
used to pop head gaskets in the other make series all the time.  Luckily
for that individual, his local area has 98 octane gas so he should not
have a problem.

>3). My front tires are now gone after about 13K miles.  They are Dunlop

I'm in the same dilema.  The S0-2 is the best tire around, period.  But,
it's expensive and isn't holding up very well on Paul's car.  In fact,
at a high speed auto-x (3rd gear) we did in Bremerton, Paul's tires chunked
where mine did not and we both ran the same times and have similar driving
styles.

I've been blaming the tires as my limiting factor, but the more I race
at high speed events, the more I feel it's the chips.  I just don't have
the low-end grunt with the cup computers that Paul has with the APE chips.

As long as I can get the revs above 4000rpm, I can match Paul's times
with my SP8000's.  But, if it's a low speed event, I just hang back about
1 second.  Maybe I'm just better at high speed stuff or maybe the car is,
I really don't know.

I think I'm going to try the SP8000 ULW version next.

     For those who are interested: If you're missing your rear hatch glass, 
     you can still keep the rain from falling in your car as long as you 
     maintain a speed of at least 45 MPH!  Don't ask me how I know this (it 
     happened to my '83 944)...

I've driven both 914s and 911 Targas in the rain. Rain will not enter the 
top-off passenger compartment of a 914 model, if driven in excess of 70 
MPH. This effect is observed even in a fairly strong rain.
     
However, the 911 Targa aerodynamics are different, because the Targa bar 
elevation is closer to the top of the windshield bow, and the sides are 
angled differently than the 914. Even light rain eddies around and over the 
windshield into the passenger compartment, regardless of how fast you're 
going. If you leave the top off in the rain, when you get where you're 
going, then......
     
squish, squish, squish...........
     
Damply,

     9. Gas tank - smells like leaking while filled to the top. Any 
     potential weak places?


There's a big hose that connects the filler "funnel" to the tank itself.  
It's held by clamps, which may have come loose with time and allow fumes to 
escape.  Fortunately, you can fix/replace the hose and clamps by going 
through the filler assembly from outside the car.  Unfortunately, you can't 
tell if this hose is causing the problem until you go in there to check.  
It's a couple hours labor, but is not as nasty as having to drop and 
replace the entire fuel tank!  While you're in there, might as well replace 
the little ducts that vent fumes (pressure?) too.
