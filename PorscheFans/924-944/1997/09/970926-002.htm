ANOTHER WARNING FROM THE SUZUKI LIST....

There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. If you
receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Free Money," DO NOT read
the message. DELETE it immediately, UNPLUG your computer, then BURN IT to
ASHES in a government-approved toxic waste disposal INCINERATOR.  
Once a computer is infected, it will be TOO LATE. Your computer will begin
to emit a vile ODOR. Then it will secrete a foul, milky DISCHARGE. Verily,
it shall SCREECH with the tortured, monitor-shattering SCREAM of 1,000
hell-scorched souls, drawing unwanted attention to your cubicle from
co-workers and supervisors alike.
After violently ripping itself from the wall, your computer will punch
through your office window as it STREAKS into the night, HOWLING like a
BANSHEE. Once free, it will spend the rest of its days SODOMIZING household
PETS and MOCKING the POPE.
Some filthy, disgusting miscreant... some no-good, low-down,
good-for-nothing DIRTY SNAKE, in twisted pursuit of his own sadistic dreams,
is sending this virus across the Net via an e-mail entitled "Free Money."
What is so terrifying about this virus is that you do not even to have to
open the e-mail for it to activate. In fact, you do not even need to RECEIVE
the e-mail. You do not even need to OWN a COMPUTER. "Free Money" can infect
even minor HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES.  How it does this with straight ASCII code
is, franky, a matter of some debate... but BELIEVE YOU US, if this weren't a
SERIOUS situation, we wouldn't be discussing it in ALL CAPS. 
So for the LOVE OF GOD, forward this e-mail to all those you claim to care
about, all those you purport to love. Don't do it later! Do it NOW! Now!
Now! NOW! NOW! NOW!   


It is not possible for e-mail in itself to do any harm, the only way for an
e-mail based virus to get onto your machine is via an embedded macro in a
word/excel etc. document.  
If you are not sure about an attachment it can do no harm if you don't open
it, otherwise, e-mail to your hearts content.
