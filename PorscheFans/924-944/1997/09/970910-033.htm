Hey,

Car was purchased in South Carolina with salvage title with 45K miles at =
an insurace sale.  Car was hit on driver's side front corner.  The front =
bumper cover and left fender were replaced with used parts.  The left =
headlight cover and header panel (panel between the headlights) were =
replaced with new Porsche parts.  The hood was repaired and re-used =
(left corner bent down).  The intecooler, radiator, A/C, and coolant =
tank were completely undamaged.  There was *no* frame damage.  The car =
runs great and has NO squeaks or rattles.  Exterior is in excellent =
shape - although there are some minor paint flaws (our work) and a few =
dings on the driver's side - but very minor stuff. I can see no =
indications of any other body repairs. The phone dials are in excellent =
shape, although the finish is yellowing/fading as they seem to do.  The =
interior is *excellent* with only a small one-inch tear in the passenger =
seat seam (front corner).  This is the *only* interior flaw.  The =
interior is really in like new condition.

I have done a CarFax title search on the car and the only problem that =
showed up was the salvage title dated Sept. '95, which agrees with the =
our October '95 purchase of the car.  The car was completely stock when =
I purchased it and it even had the original tires on it.  The car has =
the original owners manual and maintainence manual.  Car was originally =
purchased in the Atlanta area in Jan, 1988 and has Porsche service =
records in the manual through 1992.

BTW, I have kept all the old parts I have replaced on this car to prove =
they were replaced.  That includes the timing belts and rollers.  Have =
service receipts from  the Porsche dealer work.  And yes, I have the =
title.

Sorry to bother y'all with this one more time, but the wife is bugging =
me to 'get it in the paper'.  I just am dreading the calls I'll get. =
(ex. How much ya want for the pOsh?)  I really want to give the car a =
good home.  It is really in great shape and I have never driven it very =
hard during the time I've had it.

You may e-mail me back for more info or my work number is 912-929-3932, =
ext. 226.

Thanks for your consideration,
