I also had this problem on my late departed 951. I thought it was shims
or pads, something simple like that. It turned out to be corrosion under
the stainless steel slider plates on the rear calipers was jamming one
side of the caliper. This was an expensive fix. Pull your wheels off and
have a look. If one pad is more worn than the other you have a new
problem. Go find someone that knows brakes, you don't want to find out
the hard way that you brakes aren't up to scratch.

Sounds like you have some racing pads.  Repco makes some pads for your
car that
are cheap, and work fine for daily driving.  They are probably the worst
pads
I've used for track and autocrossing.  If you plan to attend some driver
eds,
buy some racing pads (or use the ones that you have in the car) for use
on the
track.
