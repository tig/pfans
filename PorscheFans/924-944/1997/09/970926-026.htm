Dear Mark & Mike
     Last April I too replaced my clutch in my '86 951 myself!  I spent about
$1100 in parts total for everything I needed to complete the job! In addition
to the basic clutch kit (about $450 from Porsche): pressure plate, disc,
release bearing, I would also reccomend replacing the following parts at the
same time! Clutch release arm/fork that moves the release bearing ($300),
needle bearings inside of clutch/arm ($28), Heater control valve - this valve
WILL Leak coolant onto your new clutch! I would also consider moving the
valve up front near the oil filter like Porsche did on latter 944's '88's &
up! Replace all clutch hardware bolts and flywheel bolts, resuface flywheel,
you might replace your rear or all the coolant hoses at this time. I now
unsderstand that if you use the factory Turbo S clutch kit, as did I, that it
is only a matter of time before the (six?) little springs in the clutch disc
will break loose! The solution is to buy the clutch kit, but DO NOT use the
clutch disc, instead buy a Sport Cup disc that has only the four large
springs in the center of the disc($400)! You might also replace the clutch
master and slave cylinders AND hydro-slave hose/line at this time, it will
never be this easy for a long while! 
    It took me about 18hrs with two other friends of mine using a shop lift!
 Have Fun!

                      Good Luck, Dave Jalali
