Even when the rotors are turned to their minimum spec they have lots of metal
left.  The reason for the rotor wear limit is so that the pistons don't extend
themselves too far out of the caliper.  (although a thinner rotor can be more
susceptible to warping)

A mechanic once told me an old dirt track trick was to shim the brake pads so
that they could use thinner rotors (so they could save weight) on their cars.
