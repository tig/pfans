Hmmm, so, let me understand this.  Owning a Porsche that, yes, is a tad
underpowered, but will still hold its own in the handling department is a
punnishment?

I would like to compare my maintenance records for the last, say, 50,000
miles with any 944.  As a matter of fact, I changed my timing belt last
weekend and it took 35 minutes from start to end and cost me $7.50 for
parts.  And with 150k miles on it and still has the original clutch.
Granted, it's ready for a new one though.

So, quit bad mouthing 924's.  Some of us do not have the luxury of an
unlimited checking account to own/maintain a 944 / 944T.  Besides, my Weber
sidedraft conversion is almost complete, then add a cam, and I will probally
be able to take on any NA944 (8 valve) in the power department and still
have cheap insurance and excellent reliability.

Sorry for the ranting, I take things too personally.

Jay
