The camshafts sit in a housing at the top of the motor, and along the
edge of this housing there are forgings that are tapped to accept the
bolts that hold on the camshaft cover.  One of these forgings has split
and the inside half has disappeared (no it's not in there anywhere, the
shop that broke it probably kept it).

The shop tells me this is impossible to fix, but I've been known to work
miracles with JB Weld on everything from my water pump (the one in my
house, not my Porsche), to my boiler.  This is not a critical stress
point, and in fact it's been broken for a little while and there is no
apparent oil leakage, but would it be possible to fix this with JB Weld
or something similar?  Would that material be able to take the 10 nm or
7 ft-lbs of torque required?
