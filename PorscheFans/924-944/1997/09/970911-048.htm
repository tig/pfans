>I would be curious to find out what happened in Jim Richmond's case. =

Jim? Is that incredible beast of yours back on the track, and if so did =

you ever resolve your cut out problem? Did you ever purchase that new =

(used) brain?
<

Ed,

No, maybe and yes.  The incredible hulk is at the moment engineless. =

Piston meltdown in #4, however the new copper head gasket held tight.  On=
e
step forward and one back.  The replacement pistons are overdue from J&E.=
 =

My hit list is growing.  =


Checkout George B's post on overboost.  This is in all probability the
problem.  My builder has a fix which I will post after it is successful. =


I bought the brain and it didn't solve the problem.  Strange because a
borrowed brain almost eliminated the cutout.  I'm keeping the brain becau=
se
we are short of brains in SoCal and I/we/? have misplaced the original
brain.  Told you there was a brain shortage here in Baja north.

On the bright side, I'm auto-xing the S-2 this weekend so I will have a f=
ix
that should last until the October time trails.  The red beast will be
running by then.

Jim Richmond
