Nick:

I have a 93 968 that I track frequently (24 track days so far this =
season).  This past weekend at Brainerd International Raceway (BIR), a 3 =
mile, 10 turn road track in northern Minnesota, I had the opportunity to =
run with a S2.  Coming out of turn 9, right on the tail of a S2, I was =
not able to gain any ground on him.  The interval between us stayed the =
same.  Between turn 10 and turn 1 (the main stretch, a distance of =
approx. 1 mile) the S2 and I maintained the same interval.  I could not =
pull this guy at all.

My suggestion, send the $$ on more track time and/or driving school.  =
That's what will make you faster.

MGW

P.S.  I take the S2 guy through the corners.  In lap times I am first in =
my class and 5 seconds faster than the closest S2.
