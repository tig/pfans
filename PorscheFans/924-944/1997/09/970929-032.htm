Just need some advice. I recently replace the front rotors with factory
cross drilled plus new pads. On the rear, I only replaced the pads. Now my
problem is under hard braking, the fronts will lock up the tires easily. It
feels like the balance has been thrown off. Before, I could lock up the
front if I really stomped on it, but it took a real effort. I cant tell if
braking has been reduced,( it stops hard) but it feels like the fronts are
too strong. I was wondering if the bias was adjustable, or should I buy new
cross drilled rotors for the back.(too much $$$$$$)
I just wish the original owner had ordered ABS!!!!!!!!
