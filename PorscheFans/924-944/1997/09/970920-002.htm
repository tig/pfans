Welcome to the land of the Oil Fairy.

I, too, have been struggling to resolve oil leaks on my 89 Turbo.

George Beuselinck has about the best advice I have heard this side of the 
Virgo Cluster.  George recommends using cans of Carb cleaner to 
completely wash existing oil off the engine first (do this where there is 
plenty of ventilation).  Inspect the area daily for the return of oil.  
You may have to repeat this operation a few time to pin point the source.

My Turbo leaked oil onto the same spots as your car.  I have just 
replaced the gasket for the aluminum oil filter housing between the 
engine and the casting.  That rubber seal is a popular source for 
escaping fluids.  You can do this job yourself, but you should first 
drain the coolant system before you do.

There are some O rings that should also be replaced as a matter of 
course.  Your local dealer can help sort out what you need.  Prices are 
so cheap that it doesn't save you a significant amount by buying at the 
dealer.  The dealer can open their parts book (fiche) and walk you 
through everything you need.

Have fun.
