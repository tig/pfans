hey all,
as promised my update on the blueberry (yuk) 944, the jury is in..
nope , didnt buy it, was going to, but didnt. 
 after reveiwing all the mail porschefans sent me (again, thanks), going over
the pros and cons of the 83 944, thinking about the mint interior, the
2500.00 set of momo wheels, the "apparently" well maintained car , and the
the $2200.00 purchase price (yep, cheeeap), i decided to buy it. but then , i
call the guy and tell him ill be by to pick it up with my mechanic and the
warning signs start.
now he cant find the maintinence records, sounds a little funny, etc. i call
him back the next day and the car is "sold" to someone else. 
sometimes procastination is a good thing, i've got the feeling there was more
to this car than i wanted to find out about......

eric  
78-924 :)

ps- has anyone converted a 924s using a carrera gt body kit??
      just a thought :)
