>This seems to be a common problem for us 951 owners. Because I don't 
track my car I usually don't find myself traveling at that speed...but I 
have on occasion, and on occasion I suffer the same symptoms, although 
intermittently. I was e-mailed by one Pfan who said he had a small split 
in the left intercooler to turbo pipe, and I believe it was Dana Kincaid 
who remove his air flow sensor to give it a once over, after 
reassembling solved his problem. (Correct me if I'm wrong here Dana.) 
Others suggest a new DME is in order, and I recall one NA944 that cured 
a similar problem with a DME swap. 


   Yes, I had this cut-out problem, but not at any one speed.  Mine
occured at full throttle acceleration, period.  After a few seconds the
engine would shut down, then as RPMs decreased cut back in, then cut out
again.   I am still not convinced it was not a vaccuum leak, but since I
cleaned the air flow sensor connector while I had the air filter box
removed and tightened the fittings for vaccuum lines at the same time
after changing both computers out and the Throttle Position Sensor
(which didn't help) I am not completely certain of the fix.  

Dana Kincaid (still pissed off at the mechanic who had me buy those
computers which are now sitting around gathering dust which I'll sell at
$400.00 for the set)
