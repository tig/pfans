I have had (and unfortunately still have) this problem with my 1984 944
with 115K.
It was an intermittent problem, which made me think it wasn't too serious=
=2E
If I ran the engine over 4000 rpm either on the road or without load the
tick would go temporarily, but when the engine was off,I the oil drained
from the cam followers and the tick came back. The first thing I did was
renew the injectors, since they were ticking aswell - it wasn't the same
tick!

I changed the oil (from what I don't know because it ticked slightly when=
 I
bought it) to Castrol GTX Magnatec (synthetic 10w-40). I'm pretty sure th=
is
improved it, but it still ticked.
I ran engine flushing oil through and filled up with Mobil 1 (0w-40).
Overall, the engine ran better but it still ticked.
Within a week I put flushing oil through again and filled up with the
magnatec again. These cars can be obsessively expensive can't they?!  It
still ticked.
Facing up to the fact that after 14 years and 115k miles the followers
might just be a bit tired I had someone replace the ones that were worn. =
3
needed changing according to the garage. SUCCESS (nearly). The ticking is=

now much quieter, although I think that all 8 should have been replaced
while the engine was down. I have just had it serviced by an OPC and they=

seem to think all is as it should be. (It's back on Mobil 1).
