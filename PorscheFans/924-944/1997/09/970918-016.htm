Hello Dana,

Boy is that guy wacked! I suppose there might be problem with terminology.

A stock 951 is supposed to develop .75 bar positive boost pressure. 
The dash gauge reads in absolute pressure. So 1.0 on the dash gauge
is normal atmospheric pressure, or 0 boost. 1.8 on the dash gauge
is really .8 positive boost, or normal. (Note that when cruising,
the dauge will be below 1.0 bar, usually around .4, or NEGATIVE
boost. During those times, there is a vacuum in the intake manifold,
as the turbocharger is not adding any charge to the mixture.)

The mechanic is probably confused on how the gauge operates. He
probably thinks that 1.2 on the gauge is 1.2 bar of boost instead of .2
bar boost. Either way, he's clearly confused on 944 turbos. For 911
turbos (I'm getting out of my area of knowledge here), there is a 1.2
bar wastegate spring that allows the car to generate 1.2 bar of real
boost pressure. That's not stock for a 911, but perhaps that's what 
he's referring to.

One more note, if the 951 computer system (DME/KLR) detects a problem
with one of the engine sensors, it will limit boost pressure to
..2 max (1.2 on the gauge). The car will be slug slow with that pressure.
So, if you feel the car is real slow, check how much boost you're
getting. On a few occasions, my car has only developed .2 bar
boost. I turn it off, turn it back on, and then have full power.
