1. Dorset, Southern England, Europe
2. 1985 NA 944 (no sunroof) £5000 (approx $8000) About  $2000 spent to bring 
it up to a good standard
3. Imperial gallon (1.2 US gallons) costs about $5
4. I pay about $500 for fully comprehensive insurance, I'm 41, with 50% 
discount. Very few companies will insure people under 35 and if they do its 
often v. big money.
5. Local dealer rate is about $80/hour. Belt tension check is I hour, steering 
geometry check and adjustment is about $150. Local hourly rates can be $30-35 
but you get what you pay for. Spares are similar to US prices

Additionally, with reference to purchasing a 944. Believe the postings when 
they say there is no such thing as a cheap Porsche. Look long and hard, I wish 
I had read this list before I bought mine. 
When they are sorted they are such a dream to drive.
