 I seem to remember an IFC ( I think ) ad in excellence some time ago
which had them listed.~ $500.  I don't have a copy about so I can't give
you a number. You could also try AIR or one of the other composite panel
specialists that advertise. Remembering that those lights left the
factory on a car, they will have a factory part number.

Hello All-

I was looking at the pictures Farzaan put up (cool pics, nicely done
Farz!)
and saw a 951 with glassed in headlights as oppossed to pop up ones.
Has
anyone done this or know of how to do this?  Are there kits available?
Is
it ridiculously expensive?  I have never seen this in the larger
catalogs,
though I seem to remember seeing photos of a 924GTR somewhere sporting
this
look.

TIA,
Riff
