A friend of mine accidently parked his '88 951 between some trees at
Bridgehampton last month and is looking to replace it. His wife got to the
check before he did so he now has a new kitchen and bathroom but no turbo
and no money for another one. He is looking for an 85.5 plus NA 944 with
records. If it is track ready thats good. He isn't looking for the perfect
car but doesn't want a piece of crap either. If you have or know of
something that fits the bill, let me know and I'll pass the info on. This is
you chance to sell that NA if what you really want is a TURBO. He also has a
set of Phone Dials w/good rubber from the car, these were not on it when he
played lumber jack.
