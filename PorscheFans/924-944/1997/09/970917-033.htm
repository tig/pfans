I'd like to know from some of you who have bought the tool whether or 
not it is worth purchasing(in terms of saving money on servicing vs. 
the difficulty of doing the job yourself). I have a 84 944 with 120K 
miles and I want to keep it for a while. I drive approx 3k a month 
all highway. I figure I need to check the belt tension every 6 months 
and change belts once a year. At the dealer service dept. that will 
run about $270 a year for labor plus I have to miss a day of work and 
stay a night in a hotel for each visit(not to mention that I have to 
pay list price for parts). Do you think I should get it? I like doing 
my own work on the care.

Who has the best price on the tensioning tool?

Also, I just discovered a coolant leak at the water pump. I hate to 
have to take it back to the dealer since I just had new belts put on 
last month. This leak is coming from where the pump connects to the 
motor. Could it be anything other than a failing pump? The motor is 
not overheating and there are no funny noises. If I replace the pump 
myself how long should it take, from start to finish? And what tools 
will I need.

Thanks in advance,

Joe Mitchell
