Hi Bill,

If the clutch engages at the top of the clutch pedal travel, that would
indicate a worn clutch ready for replacement soon.

Dear Friends,

	Due to the vagaries of a school-run server, my membership on this list is =
sporadic at best. Right now I am subscribed, but can't tell for how long=
=21 If you please, send any replies directly to me. Here's my query:


I found an 89 944S2 to buy. 30k miles, two owners, service history, definit=
e puff. I called the technician who will be servicing the car. He's got all=
 the credentials. Expecting him to say, =22Great car=21 Bring it by=21=22 h=
e says, =22I'd stay very far away from an S2. They're not that much faster =
and the customers I have that own them are getting beat to death on repairs=
..=22 I mention the problem plastic guide for the cam chain that I've read a=
bout on this list  and he says, =22Right, but even worse, heads crack all t=
he time. I have a guy who paid =2415k for an S2 that had to spend another =
=244k before he could drive it. I don't want you or anybody else to get bur=
nt on an S2. Buy a 944 or a 924S.=22


Now, I think I've done my homework, checked the FAQ etc., ran through my ar=
chives of the digests I've received and haven't come up with anything that =
suggests these problems. What say you all?


Regards,

Gary Pighetti
