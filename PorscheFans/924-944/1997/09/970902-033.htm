Two things here:

A good  mechanic will be able to assess the condition of both bearings,
the pressure plate and the flywheel surface. Many times, there are no
problems in these areas and a replacement may not be *strictly*
necessary. The amount of work and price of parts will also go into this
consideration and a good mechanic may save money on parts for his
customers with his knowledge and experience in this way.     

That said, replacing the pressure plate, a pilot bearing and release
bearing will add relatively little to the labor cost. Arguably, the
pilot bushing will add a little to the labor cost, as changing that is
tricky if removed 'in situ'. It involves special tools (a special inside
gripping 'sliding weight' bearing puller) or removal of the flywheel. 

I think the price for parts is insignificant compared to the possible
(not to say 'probable') costs for doing the work all over again to
change a 10 dollar needle bearing or a 50 dollar throwout bearing... 

If you are doing the work yourself, there is no question about it,
change all wear related parts for new ones. I would even consider
resurfacing the flywheel and absolutely check the condition of the
crankshaft seal while I'm at it. Checking the trowout arm and the
bushings is a good idea too - remember the latest trivia
quiz....                          

Good luck !
