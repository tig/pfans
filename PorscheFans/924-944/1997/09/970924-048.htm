Hey dudes,

Long time no write.  I've been really busy the last few days so I'll try
and be brief to cut down on the typing involved.

1. Brake Pad Analysis
   I tried the following pads: Hawk HPS Brown, Porterfield R4-S, stock "S"
   caliper pads and Metal Masters.

   A. Hawk HPS Brown (street/track pad)
   I hated the Hawks.  They were ROCK hard when cold, didn't stop at all,
   had no bite when cold.  As they heated, the pedal became softer, once
   nice and hot, they were like lightswitches, either full braking or no
   braking.  I actually activated ABS at 160km/h in the dry with these 
   pads!  I'll give it to Hawk that the pads do stop the car when in the
   operating "range".  I say "range" because if you get them even a little
   too hot, they go dead.  They don't give any warning that they are heating
   up too much.  If you do a hard stop from say 220km/h-0km/h, the car
   will start to slow moderately well, then around 180km/h, it starts to
   stop very hard, then at 130km/h, the pedal goes dead and the pad slides
   and the car doesn't want to stop anymore.  When this happens, it feels
   like green fade, but the pads were properly broken in (they come broken
   in, but I still followed the usual methods) and had been on the car for
   over a week and 800km of driving.

   The Hawk's make no noise that I noticed, but they dust like crazy and
   it's a really ugly "purple" dust.

   Porterfield agreed to take back the Hawks and exchange them for the
   R4-S.  Great service those guys!

   B. Porterfield R4-S (street/track)
   Squeeky, squeeky, squeeky.  They make a bit of noise, but the noise is
   a nice one.  Better initial grabbing than stock pads when full cold and
   they just get better and better.  No noticeable fade.  I tried stops
   from ridiculous speeds, but no fade, no warping of the rotor, just
   stop!  The pedal pressure is higher than stock and higher than Metalmastr,
   but lower than Hawk.

   Now, the problems with the R4-S, in our small lot auto-x, they don't heat
   up enough.  Both Paul and I went off at the first corner of this Saturday's
   auto-x.  I was the first out and spun the car when I hit boost in second
   around a gentle curve (that's another story :] )  I continued on with that
   run and when going up to the first hard left hander, I couldn't stop,
   I had to turn the wheel back straight and let the car scrub off more speed
   before turning in.  Subsequent runs didn't do much for my confidence.
   Even though I warned Paul about the pads, he went out and did the same
   thing, even mowing down a cone in the process.

   On a high-speed auto-x, these would work much better, but for our low
   speed events, this is not the pad of choice.  On the street, they work
   fine because you tend to have some heat in them when driving around.

   Lots and lots of brake dust, but still less than stock.  Easy to remove
   dust of all the pads, water alone almost takes it off.

   C. MetalMaster
   As stupid as it sounds, this is my favourite street pad.  It's cheap,
   they stop after the first stop, they don't dust, don't make noise,
   and they really work AWESOME in an auto-x.  I really missed these pads
   this weekend, but hey, someone's gotta try this stuff out!

   The only problem I've had with MetalMasters is that they transfer too
   much heat to the rotor and not enough to the caliper.  I've found that
   even in vigorous mountain driving chasing an HKS Toyota Supra TT, the
   rotors would occassionaly warp and shutter (thankfully, not permanent
   warping).

   I would not use these pads at the track, but they make a great street
   pad.  Pedal pressure is perfect for threshold braking.  I haven't faded
   these pads yet, even after a few hard laps at the local track, but I
   could see it becoming a factor in prolonged high braking use.

   D. Stock pads
   Lots of dust, lots of fade, instant bite, expensive, too soft pedal,
   crap pad.

   So which one did I choose?  I'm gonna stick my MetalMasters back on the
   car for street/auto-x use and run the R4-S at the track.  I should use
   R4's, but I want to put the pads on the night before and drive out to
   the track and change them back in the comfort of my home.  With R4's,
   you really shouldn't do that.

The next email will talk about launching techniques, which is what made
me spin in second :)

Farzaan.
