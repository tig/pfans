>Yours truly,

I don't know about the serial #, but you can check with PCNA and they can
tell you whether or not the S/N you have is a Turbo S.

Excellence has an article in the current issue by Jim Pasha which describes
the difference between the turbo and the turbo s. According to Jim, the
turbo s turbocharger is different (although I believe it is still a K-26
variant) and the "Brain" is different. He estimates the cost of obtaining
these parts in order to convert a stock turbo to a turbo s (horsepower) is
around $2,000.00.

I have had an '87 turbo since it was new. If I was going to buy one today,
I would get an '89. It has all the suspension mods, limited slip,
strengthened clutch plus the turbo s horsepower. It would cost a small
fortune for you to do all of those things to a stock turbo.

Mike
