Thanks to all who wrote back to me about which tires I should use for some
street/mostly track use until I get a separate wheel set.

I was going to order R1s, however I decided on the Yokohamas (A032r) based on
the fact that they should last longer than the R1s (although they won't be as
grippy).  I was worried that if I drove to Brainerd (7 hrs one way) and back,
and drove to Heartland park (topeka kansas) (~5 hrs one way), and to
autocrosses (2 hrs one way), that I would use up all my tires driving to and
from the tracks.

I have used R1s at autocrosses, and really like them alot (I drove my neighbors
'84 944 with R1s), but I was worried about the wear and tear on them.


Thanks!
