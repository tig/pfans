Message text written by Gail Gordon
> It seems to me that I had this problem the
last time the battery was drained and once it became charged up again
the hard start problem went away, but I just can't remember.  I'm a
blonde, you unerstand?

Details...  When it won't start, there is no movement in the Tachometer
while I'm cranking and I know not to keep cranking cause it just ain't
gonna start.  "Mr. Puffed Up" sez that indicates its a problem in the
primary ignition system.   Funny thing is though, if I lift the hood and
leave it open for 5 or 10 minutes (sometimes longer) the tach movement
returns on the crank and it starts right up?  WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?

Gail,

Nice to see a member of the fairer sex participating on the list.  I know=

the ladies can drive because several have smoked me in auto-x.

First off, give your local PCA chapter a call.  The membership chair,
President or Chief Driving Instructor should be able to give you the name=
s
of the local shops their members use for 944 repairs.  When you get a job=
,
take $36 and join.

Find one of the big auto parts chains or Sears that will do a free batter=
y
load test.  When you raise your hood and let it sit, a weak battery may
cool off enough to come back in power.  Or heat can cause a weak coil to
temporarily go bad.  This would be my guess, have it checked when hot. Th=
e
coil would explain your tach not moving.  Or it could be a bad starter.
Once again, extreme heat can make a bad starter very sluggish.  Or it cou=
ld
be a vapor lock, not common on fuel injected cars but possible.  Or it
could be your ignition or electronics.  Find a good shop and have them
check your car out.  =


Since you seem to have a fixation on hair, is it possible you have "big
hair".  Several list members have from time to time expressed an interest=

in a big haired woman.  Read the archives to find out what I am talking
about.  While you are reading them, you will probably find the answer to
your problem.
