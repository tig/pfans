While picking up my Nov copy of Excellence, I noticed that Popular
Mechanics had a lead-in title on the cover which was "Upgrade to
Quartz Lighting". I scanned through it, but couldn't find the article (DOH!).
Does anybody get this magazine, and perhaps know if this is referring to
converting a car over to this lighting (as we were talking about earlier)? It
seems within the realm of this magazine to have such a story, but in
retrospect I'm wondering if they might have been referring to home
lighting...

Kudos to Farzaan for the great postings, I think they're very informative...
