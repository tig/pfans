With that much driving to events, you really ought to look at a set of
track wheels. I was patient and picked up a set of 7's & 8's 951 phone
dials for $450. They were actually as nice as my original wheels, so I
drive the 7's around town and use the 8's for the track. In case you are
curious, a set of track wheels and tires will fit in the back of a 951 and
the hatch will close.
