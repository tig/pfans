	Hello everyone I just bought an '86 951. I would like eventually build =
a 2.8 race rocket out of it, but right now I just want to get it on the =
road. But before I can ride I must work. All I have to do is install the =
motor, it is from an '87 951. I am planning on putting a new water pump, =
cam seals, balance shaft seals, & new belts before I install it. Is =
their any thing else I should replace while the engine is out? Are their =
any difference in the '86 & '87 motors?

	The first thing I have to address besides the engine it the exhaust. =
The car only came with the exhaust manifolds, so I will have to buy a =
new pipe & muffler. I am looking at B&B Fabrications, Power Hause, and =
Borla. Does anyone have a test pipe? If so does it bolt to the exhaust =
manifold and replace the whole cat or is it just a pipe welded in place =
of the cat? Does any one make a separate wastage pipe that directs the =
excess boost straight into the air? I would like to be able to hear it =
pop open.

	The second thing I want to change is the clutch. Does anyone have a =
centerforce duel friction setup? Is it worth $1000? How about the cup =
car clutch? Or is the factory clutch enough? I also want a lightweight =
flywheel. Does anyone any advice?
