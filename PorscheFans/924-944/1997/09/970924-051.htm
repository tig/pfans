3. The season has ended with me in 4th :(
   So dudes, the season is over and I think I've placed 4th overall.  This
   is ok, but I was expecting more this year.  A lot of bad luck and some
   bad driving caused this result.  At least I'm the highest of the street
   tire dudes that will be contesting A/SS next year and I beat a few guys
   that were running race rubber.

   There were a number of occassions this year where I had the 2nd fastest
   time (no one has yet to beat the 911TT that placed 1st in every event
   it entered), but had damn cones, usually stupid ones.  It's unfortunate
   that occured.  This year was also unusually consisted of slow courses,
   which do not favour my chipset (remember, at part throttle, my cup
   units are the same as stock!)

   This last weekend's auto-x was a disaster for me.  First run was a spin,
   second run I took it easy and got a respectable time, third run I tried
   Paul's S0-2's on and could not get the car to turn in.  This was likely
   caused by the brand new front tires with the worn in rears.  The car
   would just not turn in.  I went 1.8 seconds slower with the S-02's than
   my SP8000's!  Whatever the case, my car is right now being fitted with
   a fresh set of S-02 rubber.  If both front and rear are new, the car
   won't have much grip, but at least it will be neutral.

   I ended up placing 2.5 seconds back from the 2nd place guy (no one cares
   what the 911TT ran, it is being re-classed next year to a higher class),
   which is pathetic to me.

   I'm making a vow right now.  If I do auto-x next year, I'm going in to
   win.  That means R1's, proper chips (APE or MFS), and a competition 
   alignment.  Hear that Wes and Darren, if I compete, I'm kicking your
   butts next year :)  Darren and Wes did very well this weekend, as well
   as Paul on his Kumhos.

   Now, the question Wes and Darren should ask, will I come out in this
   Porsche, or a different one, or maybe a different car???  All I'll say
   is, if I do come out to auto-x (I'm also Kart Racing next year), it
   will still be in A/SS or A/SP.

   The next email is about car problems and solutions.

Farzaan.
