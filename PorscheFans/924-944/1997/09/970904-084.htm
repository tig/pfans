Steve, my experience with these was much like yours.  It seems that when
old guards reach the cracking stage, the plastic just doesn't have enough
strength to peel off with the glue.  I found that more heat did not help
that much (I borrowed a professional heat gun from a body shop).  It just
became a gooier mess but with a very careful application of a razor blade,
I was able to remove a fair amount of the glue.  What glue was left I
removed with lacquer thinner and a roll of those heavy duty shop paper
towels.  It was an all-weekend process.  Wear some rubber gloves as the
lacquer thinner will dry out your skin terribly.  It was one of the most
awful jobs I've ever had to do on the car but it did improve the appearance
significantly.  If anyone has found a better way, please share.

I did find clear replacement guards from Zims (they always advertise in
Pano).  They did not appear to be quite as thick as the originals but at
$89 a set (something like that), they were adequate.  After 1&1/2 years
they appear to be holding up O.K.  

Good luck.
