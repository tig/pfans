Found this variation of an old joke out on the usenet site, enjoy!! 

As the story is told:
A horse and a mouse live on a large, beautiful farm.  The owner, being
prosperous, owned a 90 Porsche 944S2 Cabriolet.  One day, while walking 
the grounds after a heavy rain, the horse slipped down a hill and ended up
in
a huge mud pile.

Quite stuck, he started hollering for help.  The mouse, hearing his fevered
cries, raced over to investigate, and after seeing the horse's predicament
ran off towards the farmhouse.  Not long after, the horse heard a dull roar
and saw the mouse pull up in the Porsche.  After affixing a rope to the
car, (don't know where) he tossed it to the horse, and proceeded to tow him
 out of the quagmire.

Several days later, the mouse, on a similar walk, ended up in the same
pile.  He squeaked, and squeaked, and eventually the horse heard him and
came over.  

The horse, unaffected, walked over to the mud pile and with front legs on
one side and hind legs on the other ended up directly over the mouse.  

"Quick, Quick, go get the Porsche!" cried the mouse.

"No, my friend, just grab onto my shlong, and I'll haul you out."

Trepidatious, the mouse none-the-less complied and was rescued.  

The moral of this story is that if you're hung like a horse, you don't need
a Porsche.
