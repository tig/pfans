Hey Eric,

	I enjoy corresponding with others who have found the joy of the 924.  I am
fighting some bugs right now.  They are:

1.  EGR filter exhaust leak.  (Part on order.)

2.  Overheating.  Finally fixed.  Fixed the following; removed clogged A/C
condenser, rodded out radiator, new fan swx, new fan, and the final fix....
got the left fan blowing the right direction!

3.  A grinding rattle when I make a right turn.  It's still there despite;
replacing a badly worn CV joint, replacing the rear wheel bearings,
repacking the front bearings.  Any clues.  I also seemed to have picked up
a steering wheel shimmy.

4.  Weak heater fan.  Not a problem now, but in a couple of months...

5.  Poor idle on start.  I think it is either the Warm Up Regulator or the
Auxiliary Air Valve.  The problem is which ever I replace first the other
will be the problem.

6.  A starter that don't work when warm.  It isn't the grounding.  I've
fixed that!

Any help would be appreciated.
