SO-2s are great, although they wont stop your car dead from 60 MPH in 30
feet on a wet road when an on coming car cuts across your path. Pity.
Mine are holding up well after 10k miles. About 1/2 worn at the back. I
must add that they get worked out on the open road and I was going to go
to my first autocross on Sunday.
SP 8000 ULW.
ULW???

I'm in the same dilema.  The S0-2 is the best tire around, period.  But,
it's expensive and isn't holding up very well on Paul's car.  In fact,
at a high speed auto-x (3rd gear) we did in Bremerton, Paul's tires
chunked
where mine did not and we both ran the same times and have similar
driving
styles.



I think I'm going to try the SP8000 ULW version next.
