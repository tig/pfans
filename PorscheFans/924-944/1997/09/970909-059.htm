This whole timing belt business with 944s really points out the =
incredible
stupidity of this design.  It has to be one of the worst designs going if
everything is so critical.  Geez, I just replaced the timing belt on my
'92 Honda Civic Si after 97,000 miles and routine runs to 7500 rpm and =
the
old belt looked brand new!  Ah, if only Porsches could be so reliable, =
but
then I guess 944s would sell for a lot more than they do now, so maybe
it's good after all since I might be looking to purchase one soon :-)
