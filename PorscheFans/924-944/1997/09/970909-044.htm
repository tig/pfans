There is no secret to changing a timing belt. The trick is to take it to
a REPUTABLE SPECIALIST OR DEALER. Thus avoiding problems. The belt
requires tensioning by a special Porsche manufactured gauge that is
almost prohibitively expensive. I'm sure you have been made aware of
what happens if the belt breaks. Find a good shop and build a rapport
with the service manager and head mechanic, it will all help in the long
run.

Subject: Changing timing belt for the first time

I have just purchased a 1988 944 N/A less than a month ago and after
spending some time going throught the PO's maintenance records and
calling the local shops that have done service on the car, I can not
find where the timing belt has ever been changed. The car just turned
77,000 miles, after reading the Owners manual, Haynes repair manual, FAQ
by Kevin Goss & talking with a couple of Porsche repair shops the belts
need to be changed ASAP. I would like to attempt the job myself, are
there any secrets, tricks and/or problems that anyone has run across?
Should both timing belt and balance shaft belt be changed at the same
time?

TIA for any help.
