     I bought my 944 a few months ago and I am having the same exact prob=
lem
as Jim Howard with the windshield washer pump (good pump, good relay, wha=
t's
up?)  I'm very eager to fix this small but aggravating problem.

A few questions from a first time P-car owner:

     Do these "performance chips" make any noticeable difference on a
normally aspirated car?  I won't be racing.

     I have a "clam shell"  chip in my front windsheld.  It is not spread=
ing
(yet).  Is it possible to get this repaired.  I've heard how much a new o=
ne
costs.

     I've read timing belts should be changed every 30K miles.  My Porsch=
e
mechanic said more like 50K.  What is the general consensus?

     If anyone is interested, I fixed my center console cassette box  by
making
hinges from clear flexible plastic.  I cut three tabs about 2" by =BD" fr=
om a
plastic candy container and screwed them in to the lid and box.  It works
great, looks fine and cost me nothing.
