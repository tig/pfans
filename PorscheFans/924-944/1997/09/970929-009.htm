P-Fans,

I recently bought an 83 944 black, and have come up with some questions
about the car.  

First, I have a question to all the people who have made a family car
out of the 944.  How do you reply when your significant other mentions
that "You seem to care more about that car than me!"  

My wife has been talking to yours hasn't she.  The next comment is if you
like that d--- car so much maybe you should sleep with it. 

Second, When I fill up, I usually get alot of gasoline vapors inside the
car.  I checked under the car, but there doesn't seem to be any leaks,
so I am a little perplexed.

Can't help here.

Is the antenna on the 944 supposed to be power???  Call me vain, but I
think pictures look nicer when the antenna is down, and I can't get mine
to go down.  Has anyone ever replaced one.

I replaced mine with a aftermarket unit from Radio Shack for $40.00 works
great.  Putting it in is a different story.

Finally, what is the normal oil pressure of a normally aspirated 944. I
think mine is high, but a friend said that is just the way the car is.  

Thanks is advance, 

Collin W. Dykstra
