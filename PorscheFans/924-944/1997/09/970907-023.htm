Bill,
I also have some blue smoke excreting from my 85.5/944's tail.  Not a =
lot, but enough it worried me.  I can smell it when I smash the pedal to =
the floor.  I recommend a leak down test.  I found 24% leakage in #3 =
cylinder!!   Porsche told me if all cylinders were within a few =
percentage points of each other and under 10%, things were fine.  =
Needless to say, I'm saving for an engine rebuild.  Hope you don't have =
the same problem!
