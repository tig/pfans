<< What should the correct/factory/okay cylinder pressures on a 1986 944
Turbo?
 
 I currently have: 1=150, 2=145, 3=145, 4=90  (PSI)
 
 What EXACTLY does 8.0:1 compression ratio mean?
 
 Does it have anything to do with what cylinder pressures should be?

If those are the correct figures, then you have a problem with the #4
cylinder.  HOWEVER, since it's the #4, and I assume you measured that last, I
strongly suspect that you didn't get an accurate measurement.  These cars
have hydraulic valves.  By the time you got to the last cylinder, I bet you
had pumped the oil out of the lifters, resulting in a bad reading (valves not
opening/closing properly).
Try again, but this time run the engine for a few minutes between testing the
2nd and 3rd cylinders.
