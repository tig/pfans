We've had the balance shaft belt fail every 15K miles from the time our '92
968 coupe was new.  I retensioned the belt after 1500 miles as specified in
the manual (I have the $400 tensioning tool), but it did not help.  The last
time the belt was replaced, Porsche had updated the belt and made it a bit
wider.  I'm waiting to see how long this one lasts.  I suspect there was too
big of a gap between the belt and the curved shield by the crankshaft pulley.
I asked the technician to check this gap when I brought the car into the
dealer for the 60K mile service and replacement of all belts.
