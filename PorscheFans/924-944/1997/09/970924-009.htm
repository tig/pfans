I don't mean to sound unappreciative or impolite, but your solution is 
like a lot of other solutions I've seen on the list -- you haven't proven
that it will work for everyone.  (I'm assuming that you're basing your
solution on your personal experience.   If I'm wrong, please correct me).  

In the process of changing tires, there's a lot of other things that 
get changed too, like the wheel balance.  Without controlling for those 
other factors, you can't point to the tires as the source of the problem.
You may have simply "happened" to have masked the symptoms, or unwittingly
fixed the real problem.

My car acquired the shimmy after I put four new Yokohoma AVS Intermediate
tires on it, bought from TireRack.  It didn't have the shimmy with the
Pirelli P7s that the PO had on it.  Before I replace a $450 set of tires,
I'd like to have some confidence that the proposed solution is going to
work.  If you have more evidence to support your conclusion, then please
post it to the list.
