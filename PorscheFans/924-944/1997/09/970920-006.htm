	For my 1987 944S, I got a used digital clock from Kemptons in Tampa (a
Porsche salvage yard).  However, if the clock works but you can't see it at
night it means that the bulb is gone.  In fact, after replacing my clock
(which was totally blown), The one Kempton's sent did not have a
functioning bulb and I, too, now have this problem (not a big deal, as I
wear a watch, and my stereo has a clock).  However, I did order the bulb
assembly from Vertex in Miami (ignore what you're hearing about their
repair skills, they are very good on parts).  This is s very small delicate
assembly that in placed is the back of the clock (insert and twist).   

	The process of clock access involves removing the trim from the passenger
side and the "secret" screws that reside behind the temperature sensor
cover (That little quarter sized grill on the right side of the dash) which
can be easily removed by turning counterclockwise with a coin.  The climate
control module has to be loosened as I recall.  It is possible to reach the
back of the clock without total removal for bulb replacement.  On
re-assembly, you'll need to find a way to attach the rubber hose to the air
temp sensor grill so it stays on (You'll understand once you're in there,
not a big deal).

	If you need more detail, Go to the archives for March 23, 1997, and look
for Marv De Beque's  blow by blow description of the process which makes it
sound more surgical than I recall it being.
