I had a similar problemk with an airbag warning light that wouldn't quit. 
Took it to the dealer, who searched under the dashboard (removed the
instrument cluster) for the problem.  They never found it, but it
disappeared shortly thereafter.  About the same time, I discovered a relay
box dangling from its wires just above the passenger's feet.  I don't know
what it does, but maybe it is related to the airbag and jostling it about
in the process of replacing it may have done something positive.  The
warning light has never failed since, though that relay box falls down
frequently.  Sorry this doesn't help much.
