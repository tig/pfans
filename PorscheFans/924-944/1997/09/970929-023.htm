Hello Barry (great name),

The easiest way to determine a Turbo S from a standard Turbo is 
to look at the option codes located on a sticker in the spare tire
compartment. The turbo S should have option 758, Turbo S. The engine
code should also be M44/52, a regular turbo is M44/51.

There are a number of differences between the two cars. As you write,
the suspension is different (wider, forged wheels, thicker front 
roll bar, thicker rear torsion bar, better shocks and springs).

The motor has more power due to the different turbo, and also due
to different electronics. 

To answer the question about what to buy, it all depends on what
you want. If you want a stock car that the factory worked out all
the details on, get the turbo S. If you want to buy a car, and modify
it to be real fast, then get a standard turbo and modify it. You can
make the standard turbo faster by changing the chip, and performing
other mods. However, the turbo S comes with all the goodies: Limited
Slip transaxle, dual airbags, better brakes w/ABS, better wheels, 
lux interior with 10 speaker sound system. 

It's up to you.
