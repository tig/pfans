Another car I would consider would be an E30 ('88-'91) BMW M3.  This is a
fantastic drivers car, and one of the most fun cars ever built to drive.
They are rare, and as a result slightly pricy for a nice one (or for
parts), but $15K should afford you a very nice one.  With a few mods it
will also compete with most of the best cars in the world.  The E30 M3 will
never be a great drag racer.  On the other hand, it was (and is) a
phenomenal road racer.  I own both a 951 (944 Turbo) and an E30 M3, and
both cars have there own features worth noting.  I would think that the M3
would make the better daily driver...  To be honest, either car is an
EXTREMELY good performance value.  European Car ranked the E30 M3 one of
the best used car values ever made, and I believe Car and Driver did also a
few years ago.  For one reason or another, the magazines don't give the 951
the credit it deserves.  I suppose this keeps the prices lower for those of
us who know...
