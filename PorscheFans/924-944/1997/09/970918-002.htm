Anybody in the San Jose area have a recommendation on a shop for 944 
turbos?  I've been using C.T. Automotive (formerly Carrera Tech) but I'd 
be interested in trying out  a few others. 

I definitely would NOT recommend Anderson-Behel Porsche-Audi-VW.  
I've tried them once since they tried to sell me a car for full pop that 
needed extensive repair work.  I had my new tires mounted and balanced 
since they guaranteed no damage to the rims.  It took them 2 days, the 
wheels were covered with black handprints, no valve caps and they 
"forgot" to return the good 205/50s. I can't remember if the red dots are 
supposed to be opposite the stems or colocated but, in any case, they 
were neither.   Ooops, I'm venting again....sorry.
