Well, from an evolutionary point of view, we've replaced who brought back
the biggest chunk of meat w/ who brought home the fastest lap time and
who's car is shiniest while getting the fastest lap. The social heirarchy
is indicated by the wolves you get to run w/ on practice sessions.  Your
status in the tribe is rises and falls accordingly. And the fairer sex
plays a prominent role in the manipulations. Bugs me that PCA has classes
divided according to sex. The last stronghold of division of labor by
chromosomes, outside of CW dancing.

I just had the opposite experience last weekend. A guy w/ a modified 911
had similar hp to my S2, so I thought I'd make it my task to stick with him
of the next practice session. His wife offered to time us both. I stuck
with him throughout the session, despite brief moments of terror, and guess
what? According to his wife, his fastest lap was 1:09 and mine was 1:17.
Information which she relayed with a smile. I would have had to get out and
walk the last half of the track to be 8 seconds slow.  I did not feel the
start of something wonderful. (Or was this enticement thru baiting?) I'm
buying my own stop watch. And looking for another delicate hand to hold it.

Anyway, Jim, what are you doing running a S2 on the track, whose only
saving grace is a plastic oil pan?
