Hey, watch it.  I resemble that remark.  I own a '77 924 that is my daily
driver.  Here in San Diego it is often necessary to make a quick decision
and even quicker move on the freeways.  I found that the 924 does that
rather well.  Sure it won't beat the 944 in the quarter mile, but it blasts
the Audis and other family boxes.  I love my little 924.  It is pure
economical FUN!

     The alarm control unit is located in the passenger-side footwell, and 
     it's integrated with the rest of the car's computers, I think because 
     it requires some control of the fuel supply.  As far as I know, the 
     factory alarm has sensors that tell it when the doors are opened, and 
     if a break-in is detected, the horn sounds (loudly!) for like 30 
     seconds and no one will be able to start the car until the alarm has 
     been disabled.  Unlike most modern aftermarket alarms that disable the 
     starter, the Porsche alarm will let you spin the starter to death but 
     the computer won't allow the engine to draw any fuel.
     
     Arm & disarm is accomplished by using the keyhole located next to your 
     door handle, of course.
     
     The alarm is a very sensitive piece of equipment, and you may be 
     better off not trying to re-activate it.  Moisture, heat (in the 
     computer area), and shifting your car into 1st gear may corrupt your 
     system forever.  I myself have bypassed the alarm loop because of all 
     the problems it was causing me.  My mechanics have also disabled many 
     of their customer's alarms because it can take several hours ($$$$$) 
     to diagnose glitches and it's just easier to do without it.  If you 
     have the time and patience, then this shouldn't be an issue for you.
     
     Ben

My alarm has never worked and I would like to make it work. Where is the 
alarm control box and exactly how does the alarm system work when you arm 
it.
