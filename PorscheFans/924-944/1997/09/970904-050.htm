Can anybody provide any feedback regarding professional installation of 
rear speakers?  I know works varies everywhere but I'm wondering if 
there are universal "horror" stories regarding this process.  In other words, 
dare I trust even a professional to attempt this on my car.  I get the 
impression that if I tried it there would be a lot of cussing, my car would 
be torn apart for weeks (I work 10-12 a day so I like nice 4-6 hour 
weekend jobs) and I'd break something which cost more than a 
professional installation would cost.

As input, I offer my experience on my alarm installation.

I carefully researched what I wanted in an alarm and chose the Clifford 
Intelligard 800.  I called Clifford to get the name of a locally authorized 
(trained?) installer.  

1) Guy stalls the car pulling into the service bay. (No biggie but why does 
EVERYBODY but me stall this car, the clutch is fine?).
2) I had an aftermarket set of air horns coupled to a switch on the left side 
panel by the fog light switch.  They removed this switch (no horn) and put 
the valet switch there even though there were free blanks available.  
3) They scratched up the panel a little bit using a sharp screwdriver to pry 
out the old switch.
4) Then they got under the hood and cut the power and ground 
connections to the air horn and left the wires hanging.
5) When I went to pick up the car, they had parked it by bumping the 
nosepiece into the sidewalk and left it there.  Didn't even roll back a few 
inches.  They refused to discuss the issue as there are other scratches on 
the piece and the new ones "didn't hurt anything".
6) The radar perimeter sensor was not mounted in the center of the car so 
one side is more sensitive than the other.  You can run both hands along 
the drivers side without an alert but if you walk within 6 inches of the 
passenger side, the alarm buzzes.
7) I wanted to add the capability to automagically close the sunroof when 
the alarm activated but didn't do it when they quoted me another $99 for a 
"timer" module and an additional $69 for installation.  What's in there, a 
555 and a relay, right?  Anyway, reading the owners manual later, I see 
there is already a programmable timer output on the alarm and the only 
addition necessary is MAYBE a relay.

All in all, I considered the whole outcome a wash for a number of 
reasons.
a) I love the alarm itself.  Works great.
b) I got a discount on the price as I was originally planning on installing 
two of them (one in the Acura but I'm not now)
c) I didn't like the air horns anyway.
d) They managed to fix my erratic central locking system during the 
installation process.

Anyway, this was with a professional manufacturer approved installation 
shop. I cringe to think of what would happen at the local "stereo 
superstore".  But it makes me worry about getting rear speakers installed.  
I've just installed a nice Alpine CD head unit (there was already an Alpine 
cassette deck in there so installation literally took 5 minutes..gotta love it) 
and I'd like to get some more clean volume out of it.  Nothing ridiculous, 
but good clean sound at freeway speeds with the windows down which is 
really weak right now.

While I'm researching this, I figure on starting with the door speakers.
