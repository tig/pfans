You didn't say whether you use the car for drivers' ed or for autocrosses,
but if you do, synthetic oil is a must, according to my mechanic. (I use
Mobil 1). However, you need to track down the cause of the noise: I doubt
Mobil 1 will fix that. 

After switching to Mobil 1, my car did begin to leak a little oil.
