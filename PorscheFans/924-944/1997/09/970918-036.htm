I am new to the digest so hopefully someone can help me out...

I have an 87 944T(951) that experiences an increase in idle speed up 
to around 1900rpm.  When the idle increases, the rpm rises but the 
boost gage does not move.  The car will also want to lurch forward 
under compression while driving occasionally (very annoying).  The 
lurch feels similar to the acceleration of the cruise control, but is 
jerky.  The car is stock except for an Autoauthority Stage 2 chip and 
conical K&N air filter.

Two events seem to precipitate the condition, especially both in 
combination:
1.	If the car is has been shut off and re-started or
2.	In hot weather

I live in the Seattle area so the weather really doesn't get above 90 
more than a few days a year.  The dealer has tuned the car to take the 
upgrades into account and says everything checks out.  I have never 
been able to get the car to perform the condition while at or being 
driven by a mechanic.

I have researched this and can't find reasonable explanation and the 
dealer cannot explain it either.  Is it simply a bad chip?  Any 
comment(s) or help would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I am looking for a set of C2 7.5 & 9x17" wheels in 
excellent/good condition with or without tires.  Would be willing to 
trade my 7 & 8x16" polished flat dish wheels with center caps in good 
conditions.  My tires are toast.
