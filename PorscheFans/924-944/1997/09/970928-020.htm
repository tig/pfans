>P-Fans,
>
>I recently bought an 83 944 black, and have come up with some questions
>about the car.  
>
>First, I have a question to all the people who have made a family car
>out of the 944.  How do you reply when your significant other mentions
>that "You seem to care more about that car than me!"  
>

The truth hurts, doesn't it?

>Second, When I fill up, I usually get alot of gasoline vapors inside the
>car.  I checked under the car, but there doesn't seem to be any leaks,
>so I am a little perplexed.

There are many places and gaskets that tend to weep fuel.  Over the tank 
are a matrix of hoses and the gaskets for the fuel level also can leak.
>
>Is the antenna on the 944 supposed to be power???  Call me vain, but I
>think pictures look nicer when the antenna is down, and I can't get mine
>to go down.  Has anyone ever replaced one.

My old 84 had a power antenna.  They get sticky and I used WD-40 to keep 
it moving up and down.
>
>Finally, what is the normal oil pressure of a normally aspirated 944. I
>think mine is high, but a friend said that is just the way the car is.

When cold it should be at about 4.5 to 5 (full scale),  when warm at idle 
it should be above 1.5 (typically about 2.5).
