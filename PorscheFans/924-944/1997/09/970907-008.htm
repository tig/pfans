     - car was due for an annual service at 44,000 miles.  Since it's 7 
     years old I thought it would be a wise move to have the belts changed. 
     
     Porsche main dealer did the job.  Afterwards there was a noise like an 
     old vaucuum cleaner when the engine was hot.  I took it back to the 
     dealer.  After checking he confirmed that the noise was not normal, 
     and replaced the idler and tensioner pulleys on the balance shaft 
     drivebelt.  He said the new belt, properly tensioned, had shown up 
     wear in the bearings in the two items.  I pointed out that they should 
     have spotted this when they were changing the belts.  He agreed, and 
     reduced the bill.  Still cost me over $200 on top of the original $800 
     bill.
     
     Noise now is better, but still not as quiet as it was before the belt 
     changes, particularly when hot.  Dealer says it's normal, and will 
     reduce when the belts bed in.
     
     Anyone out there have any thoughts on whether this is reasonable.  
     When I had the belts changed (by the same dealer) on my last 944 (an 
     "S"), there was no difference in noise afterwards.
