Simple - don't give her an excuse to think that way.  Do you get her 
flowers and gifts only on special occasions, while getting new toys for 
your car whenever?  Do you pamper her only on her birthday or anniversary, 
while lovingly washing and waxing your car every weekend?  Maybe you really 
do care more about the car!

Consider what you're paying per month for insurance.  Consider spending 
some amount on your significant other once in a while as another kind of 
insurance.  Think about how much time you spend with your car.  Maybe your 
significant other would like the same attention once in a while.  It works 
for me.

You want proof?  Not only does my wife not complain about my current car, 
but this weekend we'll be driving from Michigan to Virginia so I can look 
at a 928 S4 and (hopefully) bring it home.
