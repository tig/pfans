I think you would most definitely be ahead of the game by replacing the
water pump and oil seals.  My original pump went at about 60K miles and the
cam seal began leaking at about 80K.  Another common leak point is at the
back end of the balance shaft covers. Changing all of the cam belt rollers
may be a bit excessive in my opinion since these will usually make a fair
amount of racket before failing from what I've been told.  And it is
relatively easy to get in there and change them after the fact (unlike the
pump and seals).  The belt would have to be re-tensioned in this case
though.  I finally replaced my rollers at about 130K just to be safe (they
were still working fine).  However, if you drive your car long distances
from home, the piece of mind of new rollers may be worth it.
