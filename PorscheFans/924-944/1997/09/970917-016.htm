Hello Fellow Porsche Fans,

As far as the clutch is concerned, at the end of the torque tube that
connects to the transmission, there is a "viewing" plate that pops off
and exposes the drive shaft.  An easy way to find if your clutch is bad
is grab the shaft and try to rotate it.  It should be solid, if you have a lot
of play then the rubber center is most likely detached and you are in
need of a new clutch.  I'm speaking for 944 NA only.    In my case, I had
the normal thumping and hesitated acceleration  and a shaft that rotated
almost 45 degrees both ways!!.  Don't ignore it  or you' may be paying
for a new torque tube in addition to your clutch!. 

On another note,  I want to thank everybody who responded to my
thread concerning continues HOT air coming from my vents!  It  turns out
that the plastic clips that hold the temp mixing flapper linkage to the
control motor was broken.  Ahhhhhh, its such a relief when a fix is
cheap!!!!
