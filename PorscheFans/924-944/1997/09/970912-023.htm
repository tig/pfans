SB 42 gives relief from smog testing for (classic)pre 73 cars.....am passing=
 
on a phone number at the Guvs office to call to register your support for
the 
bill.......this gives a rolling 25 year exemption.....your car will be that 
old some day........if you live in Californicate, please call...... 
 
"the smog bill has passed the Assembly and will now go to 
 the Governor for signing.  I called the Governor's office 
 and they said that he is undecided on wether or not he will 
 sign it or veto it.  The people that originated the bill are 
 worried that the Bureau of Automotive Repair and the Air 
 Rescources Board are pressing the Gov to veto it.  Please 
 pass this on to people that you think would help support 
 this bill and call the following numbers to let the Governor 
 know that we want this bill to pass. 
  
 916-445-1455 
talk to someone realtime and puts you 
down as a supporter on their opinion poll" 
 
Thanks, 
 
Ted
