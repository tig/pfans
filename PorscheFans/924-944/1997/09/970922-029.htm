Howdy,

Well, for those who are following my quest to get a 951, I have it right
now.  I did get the car I mentioned before.  It is an '86 with roll bar,
harnasses, limited slip, and a smi-wild paint job (Martini reproduction.)
I got the car for under $8k, with only 100K miles on the clock.  My
co-worker, and ex-shop owner/pro-driver/porsche expert looked at the car
and loved it.  Well, I am still getting used to driving it hard, I got VERY
side-ways on a freeway on-ramp.  Well, I suppose I will get used to the
turbo this weekend.  I will be taking the car to a BMW driving school this
weekend at ButtonWillow.

Anyway thaks for all the help in my getting my car.  I want to especially
thank Brent Harnish who took the time to drive to my work to show me his
car and chat about racing the 951 locally.  Thanks to everyone else who
also gave me advice by e-mail.
