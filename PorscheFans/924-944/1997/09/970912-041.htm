Same sh*t happened to me...

Saturday last week i upgraded my 1991 944 S2 to 17" cup rims (front:225/4=
5,
rear:255/40 with Michelin MXX3 Pilot SX) and let the tire shop also re-al=
ign
toe, camber, etc. (cost for alignment: DM 182, ~US$ 100!)
They handed me out a measurement protocol which i looked at on monday.
(I didn't think that they would give me back a mis-aligned car without a
notice, so i didn't have a look at it at the shop immediately.)

Then i saw, that the rear was *extremly* misaligned (neither toe nor camb=
er
was within the specs, toe was about 3 times over the spec on one side!) -=

while the front was (nearly) fine. So i drove back today and had them
re-aligning the whole car again. They spent over an hour working on my
car, but were not able to align the rear correctly, although it is better=
 now
than before. They said that they could either adjust an optimal toe OR an=

optimal camber - but NOT both at the same time. Reading the reply to your=

mail from Doug Donsbach i believe, the mechanics just don't know what all=
 the
screws and bolts are for. Shit!

And this is the tire dealer with the BEST reputation in my town.
At least i don't have to turn my steering wheel right to drive a straight=

line now...

Is it possible, that it is not possible :) to align the suspension
so that everything is within the specs??? (Assuming that the car
has no damage)
