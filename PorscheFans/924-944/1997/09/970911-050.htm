Hi all,
	I have some ??s about my steering.  I apologize in advance for 
the length but I don't know how to put it succinctly.  I find myself 
somewhat disappointed in my low speed (<25mph) steering.  I haven't 
pushed the car hard but it seems fine at speeds up to 100mph straightline 
and 60mph in some easy corners.  I've only test driven 2 other 944s, one 
NA and an 87 951 and didn't notice this behavior.  The symptoms are a 
tendency for the car to want to "track?" a line other than straight on 
uneven roads and require a somewhat heavy steering input to keep it 
going straight.

	On a flat even road this doesn't happen.  There doesn't seem to 
be any play in the steering (i.e. no loose then tight when turning the 
steering wheel) but there is a small amount of what I assume is tramlining 
in that a "small" steering input from straight ahead has less impact on 
direction than the same amount of input when cornering.

	I've only had the car for a couple months and have made some 
progress.  When I bought the car, the PO had mounted 4 225/50 tires 
which were about 1/2 worn.  They were
FL SP8000
FR SP8000 (mounted backwards!)
LR SP8000
RR Bridgestone Potenza RE940

So, everyone including the shop said "What did you expect from those 
tires?" I then proceeded to buy 2 SP8000s in 245/45-16 for the rears and 
put the 2 good SP8000 225/50s on the front and had all 4 balanced.

Definitely better.  I would say the amplitude of the problem I described 
above has been cut in half but it is still there.  Next step is a 4 wheel 
alignment.  A tire/wheel store near me says that they can do this job for 
$100 "no problem".  And I was planning on taking them up on this over 
the weekend but now have a couple of ??s.

I had the car checked out at a Porsche-only shop when I bought it and 
they say that the suspension's fine but it was a cursory inspection.  Would 
these types of symptoms I have described indicate a suspension problem?  
No sense in getting an alignment if I need new ball joints or idler arm or 
something.  Also, this latest thread about adjusting rear camber with a 
special tool makes me wonder if it's not worth waiting the two weeks to 
get into the dealer to get this done?

Any advice?  One mechanic at the dealer said that he has had some 
problems with the back end wandering a bit with SP8000s.  Anyone else 
heard of this?  From the input I've seen on this group, I chose to stay with 
the SP8000s because of their dry grip.  We can't even spell "rain" here in 
central California :-)

thanks.....Greg
