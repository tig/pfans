My 87 944S has been on a lift for over  3 weeks, as they R&R engine from
bottom by removing front crossmember, supported at what I told the mechanic
early on were not jacking points - the "towers" behind the front wheels and
on another area in front of the back wheels.  He got pissed and said "Dont
tell me how to jack up a car".

When the mechanic lowered the cars today with front wheels still of, the
hatch would not open when perfect before, and the driver's door did not
close or open as smooth as before.

Mechanic said should be fine after we put it on all 4 wheels again.  I hope
so too.

Anybody have this experience before?

Could unibody have gotten deformed requiring a trip to the frame
straightening shop?

I noticed the "towers behind front wheels are now bent to the side and are
not vertical anymore.  Should I have him bend them back when done?  Anyone
try this before?

Help Please!!!!
