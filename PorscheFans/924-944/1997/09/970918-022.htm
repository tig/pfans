With the chip upgrade (Weltmeister chips + shimmed wastegate) it goes to about 1.9 on the guage. I'm pretty sure my car was very healthy before the chip upgrade, so I think it's true that the stock '86-'87 models had very mild boost levels.

  I have a sensor problem with my 86'951. Result is max. boost of 1.2 on gauge. I dynoed the car: 163 hp on engine, 134 on rearwheels. IMHO the KLR cuts off the boost at 1.2 when there is a problem with a sensor or something like that. Normally there is an boost from about 1.65 to 1.8.
