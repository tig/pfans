     Thanks John.
     
     it's always re-assuring when someone else has the same experience (and 
     no problem).

Mike,
     
I'm kind of a novice at 944's, but I recently changed my belts myself so 
I'll tell you my results.
     
I had no idea how long it had been since the belts on my 85.5 had been 
changed, but thanks to the members on this list, I decided to have it done 
as soon as I could after buying the car. I'm glad I did, because the 
balance shaft tension roller was laying in pieces at the bottom of the 
cover when I removed it. I was just lucky the loose balance shaft belt 
hadn't taken the cam belt with it. As a result, I changed all the rollers 
on the belts to start from scratch.
     
I adjusted the cam belt to 3.0 and the balance to 2.7 and ran it for about 
100 miles. The roller (belt) noise was just as you described. I readjusted 
the belts to 2.7 and 2.5, and drove it about 1300 miles with no appreciable 
difference in the noise. I adjusted them again to 3.0 and 2.7, and have 
since put about 500 miles on them and I still hear the same noise at 
approximately the same volume. (All adjustments per WKD 450 721 Porsche 944 
Servicing, Assembling and Adjusting)
     
I might add that the original cam belt didn't make any noise, but then 
neither did the broken balance shaft belt. I've decided after reading some 
of the posts in the past concerning the belts, that the noise level is 
probably a function of the particular belt and/or roller manufacturer, (I 
used OEM parts), and some are just going to be noisier than others.
     
I don't really know if I'm right or wrong. As I said before, I'm just a 
novice on this car, but I'm amazed by the engineering and design every time 
I do something new. I hope I don't break something while I'm learning.
     
Hope this helps,
