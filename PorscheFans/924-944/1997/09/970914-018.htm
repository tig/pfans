PFans:

        Hi! I just joined this list today. I am a 911 owner in HOT
Southwest
Florida and I realize that I need to put my 911 away during the hottest
summer months. I was hoping to purchase a car that was not outrageously
expensive to use during these summer months. I was hoping to look at
1985.5-1987 944's as I like the way they look and assume they are fun to
drive. A friend has told me that the ac in a 944 is no better than that
of
a
911 despite the fact that the cars are water cooled. Is this true? I do
not
want to buy an American car although everyone seems to acknowledge they
have
excellent ac. Unfortunately I believe that is frequently all that is
excellent about them. Any suggestions along this line would be greatly
appreciated.

Well David, I have a 1980 924T (931) with A/C. I live in the Central
Valley of California where it is brutally hot in the summer. The A/C on
my PCar works very well. When it goes over 100 degrees I have it on max
high, but it does the job. I've been in 911's with A/C and there's no
comparison. They just don't seem to get the job done. I'm not bashing
our air cooled brothers, because I like them very much. But if I owned
one now I would have to put it away in the summer also. Can't stand
heat.
