Howdy,

On Saturday I went to look at a '86 951 which had a roll bar installed,
fire equipment, chip, 100K miles, and a semi-wild paint scheme.  The car
was a basic grey car where the owner in stalled di-cut style decals similar
to the Martini paint scheme of the '70s.  I can't say I love it, but it was
done well, and look fine for a track car (which is what I'm looking for.)
The car had the stock Fuchs and looked pretty good.  After looking the car
over for 20 min I took it for a spin.  

First thing I notice is that the seat doesn't go back as far as I'd like
(I'm 6'2"), but it is acceptable.  Next as I back the car out I realize
that the clutch only catches when the pedal is almost all the way out. Is
this normal?  Also, the owner admits that the car is "cold-blooded" meaning
it doesn't run well when cold.  Is this normal or a common issue? The car
didn't stall or anything, but... 

The car feels flat-out like a dog off the line.  While I'm sure if I got
the boost up and then dropped the clutch thing would be different, but I
don't like replacing tires, half-shafts and clutches regularly....  I get
on the freeway.  The car drives well, no shimmy, and the steering is tight.
 I did feel that the shifter felt much less smooth than my M3.  Well, when
you punch it at 3500 RPMs, it does have VERY good power.  Certainly more
than my M3. I did take a corner faily fast, and it did well, but didn't
feel as tight as the M3.  Of course this could be due my lack of time
behind the wheel.

So, how much should this car be worth?  A 951 with wild paint, good
condition, and a roll bar.  I suppose there can't be a huge market for
these....  My engineer and I will go look at the car again today.  He used
to own his own Porsche shop, built several Porsche racing cars from 911s to
a 962 so I figure he's qualified.  But please pass on any wisdom you can.  

Reply to me directly, I get this in Digest form, and need help ASAP.

TIA
