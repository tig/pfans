Hello,

       I have posted several requests for information and always recieved
prompt response. To all those that have helped me, Thank You.
       BUT !!  This is probably a horrible excuse to sell a car I love so
much, but my wife just had my second son, and lets face it, as my only car,
it just wont work!! I just bought her a 1997 VW Jetta VR6, but we need two
usefull cars. So the 944 is on the auction block!
       My only question is, how much should it sell for? Here are the specs
on the car.

       1987 944s guards red/black leather. I have spent $5000 in the last 6
months rebuilding the car, I had no intentions to sell it!! I have had the
top end rebuilt, new water pump, belts, alternator, air flow meter, exhaust,
many new relays, re-wire of the sun roof, alarm, 1000 watt Alpine sound
system, floor mats, logo door handles (interior),

       The interior is immaculate except for 1 small crack in the dash, but
not worth a dash cover, seats are in good shape except for a 2 in tear in the
drivers side seat, (keys in pocket as getting into car). The body is in good
shape 1damage below rear quarter panel between 1/4 panel and rear bumper.

       The cars odometer was broken at some point during the rebuild process,
it has 112,500 miles + app 1000 more miles. The car runs great. How much
should this car sell for in southern Ca. I see cars with much less done and
in worse condition for around $7000-$8500 in the auto trader. I would be
happy to get my $6000 back.

       If anyone is interested, or if you think this price is out of line,
please let me know.
