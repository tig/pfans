I mentioned in an earlier thread I have installed 90/100 H4s, 130 H1s =
and 60 High Efficiency H3s in my 93 968.  The only thing I did was =
increase the size of the fuse for the H1s and H4s.  The relay for the =
fogs and driving lights is already a 40 amp therefore it should easily =
handle the load.  Could find a relay for the headlights but checked the =
wiring; it appears to be on the order of 14-16 gauge which will easily =
handle between 7.5 - 8.5 amps.  I used to install high end car stereos =
for a living and became quite acquainted with what gauge wire was =
necessary for what amp draw.

The 60 watt high efficiency bulbs claim to have a higher xenon content =
and therefore produce the candlepower of a 100 watt bulb.  They do seem =
to be slightly brighter although I'm not convinced that produce quite =
that much output.

I have also installed similar high-powered euro lights in my 87 Audi 4k =
quattro and although I did need to install a relay in the car the system =
works flawlessly.

Possible problems would be: current draw too high for wire size, and
hence voltage drop that lessens output, too high heat in reflector
(especially fog lights and high beam projectors) and hence shorter lamp
life length, too strong light and (possibly) uneven light projection (as
80/100 W may be slightly worse aligned as they are not 'legal' even in
Europe. A relay will fix the first problem, cold weather will fix the
second, oncoming traffic will tell you about 'too strong light', and a
badly aligned lamp will throw the beam adjustment off. =20

Standard Euro (E-marked) is 55/60 low/high. Illegal 80/100 or 50/100
bulbs are popular here, and is sold 'for racing use only'. HArnesses are
not different, but current draw must be dealt with. I recommend a relay.

100W/12V =3D 8.3 A. 12V is nominal, and the real value could be up to
13.2V (7.5A).

Fuses will blow at between 10-50 % overload, so a fuse of 7.5 may hold
on for longer than you think. It may also blow when you do not want to.
Melting the switch is not the broblem (the relay takes care of that) but
melting a piece of wire between the relay and the lamp (and possibly set
fire to the wiring harness and more) is a real concern. That is why a
relay solution is recommended. A 25 % increase of fuse value is not a
big deal, but be advised that there is a (small) risk for problems. =20

IMHO, the difference between standard sealed beams and H4's is much
greater than the difference between 60 and 80 W, especially if the
higher current indusces a voltage drop. A noticeable difference will
mean relays and 100 watt lamps.     =20
