Yes the tach does go to zero because it is loosing fire altogether just as
if I shut the ignition off.  We were able to determine that it is getting
fuel but it's loosing fire completely.  The engine is cranking but won't
start till it's sat for a few minutes after this happens.  There is no smoke
at all.  The only recent repair was a rebuild of the clutch master and slave
cylinders.  It ran fine for almost a week before this new problem popped up.

Yes we did so this is not happening.

Will be doing this.  My problem right now is finding the time to do it.
Wouldn't be nice if we had 36 hours in a day at least one day out of the week?

Thanks so far for everyone's input into this.
