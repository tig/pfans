Hello, I have recieved so much help from all of you, I hope I am not taking
advantage. But I need some more help. I have a 1987 944s. I have had almost
every possible part rebuilt on the car. The last things I had done were the
1000 mile retentioning on the cam belt, a oil change , and a new muffler. 
Over the last two days, I have noticed that when pulling up to a stop light,
the idle drops down to about 500 rpm, then pops backup to around 850. But
when I press the gas to accelerate, it starts to just stall,start,stall,
start then if I get the rpm up to around 2000 rpm it runs fine. I see no
difference when the car is moving, the rpm range seems fine, acceleration is
good.
It almost seemed to me like the timing was off, but I just had that checked
last week when they retentioned the belts. I had a problem about three months
ago that was similar, but the car would completely stall, then not start. It
was decided that the air flow meter was bad, and so was the O2 sensor, so
both were replaced. 
Any idea what my new problem could be. And am I the only person out there
that seems to be at his P shop every week? I love the car ( I must since I
have now spent almost $7500 rebuilding it) But this is getting real old, real
quick.

Thanks for the help,

Terry
