Other than the 86T having the old front spindle design that is more prone
to failure, are there more problems that are characteristic to that year?  

Another runner-up in my P-car search is an 86T w/ 62k miles w/ M474 and
the sport seats.  I do not know if the 474 includes an LSD but the car
drove great, even with the dreaded turbo lag in mind.  Cosmetically it is
almost flawless except for 3 scratches and mechanically the car has been
pampered. It looks a bit weird in that it has 225's both on the front and
the back, which makes me think that it may have the 7.5" and 9" wheels to
be able to fit the 255's on the front.  

Problem is that except for the belts and tires, everything is
original(clutch, waterpump, motor mounts, etc).  Nothing seems to be wrong
with any of those, but I know they will rear their ugly head, especially
the water pump).  I think that $10k-$10.5k is about right for this car
from what I have seen in Panorama, Excellence and this list.  The owner
thinks at least $2k more.  Am I being unfair in my offer to the owner? 

I apologize for my extensive posts today.  Anyone looking for an 850 wagon
as their parts car, I really need another Porsche?  :-)
