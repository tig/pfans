I don't think that this note made it to the list for some reason, so I'll
post it again:

P-fans:

I posted a note in late June about a new vibration which had developed at
4000 rpm in my 92 968 coupe.  It turned out to be a result of the balance
belt's having lost 4 teeth and letting the shafts get out of phase.  The
dealer installed a new belt and all was fine.

I took the car to a Drivers Ed event at Nelson Ledges 2 days ago (what a
blast!).  Since then, the car again has some vibration at 4000 rpm and above,
although not as bad as before.  It feels like the shaft might have slipped a
little.  Has anyone else had this problem repeatedly?  Is there a simple way
to check the balance belt and shaft positions?  Or do I have to go back to
the mechanic again?

Thanks!
