age of the car......... I'm not happy with that response.<

Jeff,

Thats BULL!  Your garage is doing the old "If we don't fix it, he will
eventually get tired of bringing it back" trick.  Find a front end shop
that is knowledgeable about 944s and have them do a complete checkout. =

Make sure they check the strut bearings (top strut mounts).  Have them
write up a list of repairs needed and present it to your garage.

BTW, if they just replaced one motor mount, probably the right one, they
should of asked you if you wanted to pay to have the other replaced.  If
one was bad, the other is not far behind.  When I pulled the engine on my=

87, I replaced both mounts with the updated style.  The right one was spl=
it
and the left had small cracks.  =


A properly maintained 944 should be as smooth as when it was new.  Do not=

let these clowns run you around until the warranty has expired.
