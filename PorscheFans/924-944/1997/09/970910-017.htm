This whole timing belt business with 944s really points out the =
incredible
stupidity of this design.  It has to be one of the worst designs going
if
everything is so critical.  Geez, I just replaced the timing belt on my
'92 Honda Civic Si after 97,000 miles and routine runs to 7500 rpm and =
the
old belt looked brand new!  Ah, if only Porsches could be so reliable, =
but
then I guess 944s would sell for a lot more than they do now, so maybe
it's good after all since I might be looking to purchase one soon :-)


  Hmmm.  From what I've seen of most Hondas, at 97 k miles they still
run, but the interiors smell like wet plastic, there is rust in the rear
quarters, the paint is shot and kids/pets have wet themselves in the
seats, there are toy plastic dinosaurs in the ash trays...  I've been
seeing those Acura Integras lately, first and second generation, and
those have the same problems.  Let's see your Honda at 200k miles... 
It's the difference between a starship and a Klingon Bird of Prey.
