Hello Everybody,

I'm reading the  8/29 digest list (been busy at work) and I think its time
we save the bandwidth for something a little more important if not
helpful than this police whining!

I have a red 944 and got caught going 88 in a 55 (hearing is November
21).  I'm not proud of it and I don't blame anybody but myself. Anytime I
go over the posted speed limit, I know am at risk of getting a ticket (but it
is so hard when I'm in the 944 (ha!ha!)).

I do believe there is some bias against Porsche owners by the police (
as well as the public), but then again, who knows what the State
Trooper was thinking.  In fact, he could have arrested  me for reckless
driving, but since it is a Porsche which can handle 88,  the State
Trooper may of thought that it wasn't worthy to arrest me but needed
something to slow me down (boy did it ever!) He politely told me the
speed limit, the speed I was going and that was that - I'm counting my
blessings on this one - it could have  be worse!

Enough said.  Lets go on to more important topics.
