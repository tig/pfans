i know the offset changed but isnt the offset of the 930's correct for the
later model 944's??  the 53.???? offset should be about right and i
know(actually am *almost* positive) there are factory 16X9's running around
for the 930's. dont know if they will work but if the offset and backspacing
is correct then they should fit, i think the tweeks catalog actually has the
right sizes listed in it with offsets and backspacing....anyhow enough rambling.
