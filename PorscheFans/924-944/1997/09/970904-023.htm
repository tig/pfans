Hi all,
	Few months ago a monkey friend of mine pushed the passenger side window
with his forearm, along with the switch to get the window down faster!
Later it got stuck and was pulled out and things were fine till another
one slammed the door so hard that the glass dropped into the door panel.
Since I had to travel the following week I took it to the Porsche Dealer
(Don Rosen Porsche-Audi), they opened it and showed me that one of the 3
rollers which move the cross-arm member has been destroyed. They also
said that the roller is not available seperately and I need the entire
cross-arm for $206. I thought that was ridiculous and I asked them to
lift the glass to the top and put a tie-wrap to hold it there. (Yes,
they charged me $95 for this small piece of work... and I left there
fuming).
	Later I talked to my regular mechanic and he suggested that this
mechanism is still used in GM cars, where as Porsche/Audi have switched
to a T-bar type of lifter.
	So my question is (1) does anybody know of this compatible GM part he
is talking about (2) can I just get this roller from a junk yard (3)
anybody can donate me one (4) anyother suggestion?

Thanks
Balaji
