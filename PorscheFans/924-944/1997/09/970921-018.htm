>  The small brass "needle valve" type screw on the top of the throttle
body, between the air intake manifold and the air intake. It has an "o"
ring
on it.  Is this an idle adjustment?  Mine was backed out all the way, and=

would have fallen out if not for the recessed fitting in the body.

2)  Behind the "grill" on the extreme left side of the car, there's a pie=
ce
of duct type hose (looks like heater box hose from 911) approx. 2-3" in
diameter which is clamped to a black plastic piece which looks like an ai=
r
intake.  This is mounted on the nose piece, outside of and slightly above=

the
air "scoop" for deflecting air toward the brake rotor. The other end (pla=
in
hose) is laying across the control arm and up against the steering rack,
just
sort of pointing upward, toward the turbo.  Where did this used to go?
<


1)  Idle adjustment screw, common problem.  Try a new o'ring, slight dab =
of
242 or drill holes in the casting above the screw and insert a cotter pin=
=2E

2)  Cooling tube for the alternator.  Two schools of thought here.  Some =
of
us have run without the hose for years and never had a problem.  A friend=

who works at an auto electric shop says these Bosch alternators are prett=
y
bullet proof.  However, check with Don, Kevin, Dave or someone who knows
for sure.  Second option, find someone with really small hands to install=

the hose.  If they have the hose on in 5 minutes ask if I can clone them.=
