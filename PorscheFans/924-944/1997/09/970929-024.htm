>First, I have a question to all the people who have made a family car
out of the 944.  How do you reply when your significant other mentions
that "You seem to care more about that car than me!"  =

        I promise her I will only spend 10 minutes per night tucking the
951 in before I go upstairs from the garage.  She also took a nice vacation
to England this year.
        My wife is quite liberated about the situation, actually. Her
comment was "well, you don't gamble or womanize, and only drink in
moderation, so I can't really complain too much about the Porsche..."

Good luck,
