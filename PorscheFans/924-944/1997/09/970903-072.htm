<< After spending a couple hours removing one of the guards (the smallest
 one!), I decided to give the local dealer a call to make sure he had new
 guards in stock. And to check the price. I figured maybe $20-30 bucks
 tops. Heck, double that since it's a Porsche, right?  Wrong!  $200 for
 what can't amount to more than 2 square feet of sticky plastic?!?  Surely
 they must be joking.
 
 So I called Tweeks for a quickee price comparison -- they want $140. 
 Tweeks is often not the very cheapest aftermarket mail order place, but
 they're usually in the ballpark with the rest. >>

Steve,
Don't panic!!!  
I just bought a complete set (OEM Porsche) from ZIMS Autotechnik for $87.
It's kit #944.559.320, and includes 6 pieces.  Their number is
1-800-356-2964.
If anyone is looking for just the front pair, I have them available.  I only
needed the rears, but the kit price was cheaper.

I also bought from them a pair of thick, clear vinyl stick-on covers for my
fog lamps for $20 --
good insurance considering the vulnerability and expense of those lamps.

As for getting the stickum off, I've seen paint-safe autobody adhesive
remover at places like Pep Boys, but I haven't tried it.

Have fun,
Kevin B
