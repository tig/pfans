hey all,

i was minding my own business , just surfing the web a little , not even
seriously looking and happened upon a 944 ad for an 83 with 90k , 17inch
wheels (real pretty), "runs good" , auto (be nice all), a/c , p/w, leather
elect seats, nice stereo..
since i've convinceD my fiancee' that she "needs" a 944 , we called on it
..(happened to be with in two hours). same day we go see it, it needs a right
front fender, the power windows dont go down (fuse/relay?), a/c needs
charging, batterys toast, and definately paint.(was red, they made it blue
(bad job), i will make it red again), rest is actually pretty nice, motor is
strong , shifts well, alternator belt slips (warning sign?).
steering is stiff (the wide tires or ??) 
kelley blue book (www.kbb.com) shows a high of $5245 and a low of $2135,
whats the concensus?, how much is this car worth??  im making an offer on it
as soon as i have the tittle /vin number researched to verify the miles. 
opinions welcome, at under $3K i think i stepped in it?!?, but am i slipping
on it instead??? coments please....:)
thanks,
eric  (ericj001@aol.com)
