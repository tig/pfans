Sounds like you have some racing pads.  Repco makes some pads for your car that
are cheap, and work fine for daily driving.  They are probably the worst pads
I've used for track and autocrossing.  If you plan to attend some driver eds,
buy some racing pads (or use the ones that you have in the car) for use on the
track.

Casual acceleration usually results in 1.3-1.4 bar on the gauge.  Full throttle
should push the boost to 1.8-2.0 bar.

If it is the oil light on the left hand side of the dash, then it is your oil
level light.  (not your oil pressure light)  Check the connections of the oil
sensor at the oil pan (right above the drain plug).  If you feel the sensor is
faulty, it doesn't "appear" to be too hard to replace.

Most people tend to stay away from synthetic brake fluid.  This is because it
doesn't absorb water, so the water pools in the lines causing corrosion.  Use a
high quality DOT 3 or DOT 4.  If you plan to track the car you might want to
look into racing fluid (winwood, ATE, etc...)

Seems like people tend to like either swepco tranny fluid or redline tranny
fluid.  Both are pretty expensive, but tranny fluid isn't something you change
very often.  I recent bought a gallon of swepco for $34.
