Ezra, 
1. Just up from the rim on the tire you should see a small raised
line in the sidewall of the tire.  Make sure this line is equa distant from
the rim flange all the way around the tire.  If whoever mounted the tire
did not use sufficient lubricant the bead may not of seated properly 
causing the casing to distort.
2. Bridgestones and I'm sure Pirellis will have a mark (dot) on the sidewall,
Make sure this matches up with the valve-stem hole.
3.  Torque the wheels to spec and in the correct order, star pattern.
More than 50% of ride complaints can be attribbuted to incorrect mounting
on the vehicle.
4.  I doubt that you have defective tires.  With todays manufacturing
technology there are good tires and not so good tires but very few
defective tires.
5.  Why did you buy different brands of tires?.  This is a real no no.
on a high-perf car.  Different break-away characteristics can make
the car dangerous when pushed to the edge.
Good Luck
Tom Bogaard
