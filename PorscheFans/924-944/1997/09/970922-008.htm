Hi Folks,

This is a follow-up to my recent 'Chug-a-Lug' posting.

Firstly, thank you to those who responded. As you recall, at the time my 
car was stalling in 2-3 gear(s) at any time, at any speed. The symptoms 
were similar to when you first learn to drive stick and you get your first 
Red/Green light (remember... the embarrassing lunging and chugging ?). A 
complete stall... the car would turn right off... similar to flooding.

Anyway, I took it in to a local Porsche Dealership and Mechanic(s). They 
could not diagnose the problem, but did change the oil, check the rotor 
caps, changed the spark plugs, and installed a new fuel filter. Happy, and 
a little poorer, I left hoping the problem was fixed. It isn't!

If anyone can offer suggestions, I would be eternally grateful.

X-tra info: when I turn the ignition, all electrical systems - good; I 
checked the fuses - all good; but, if I turn the key to just before the 
starter kicks in and then turn it off and listen, I hear a click-click-c  
lick (pause) click-click (stop). I think that this may be the throttle chip 
(?).

Could this also be the fuel pump?

Thanks,

Jonathan Arnold
