Tom,
I just recently sold my 87 944NA to buy my 86 951. I can tell you there
is nothing wrong with the NA cars, in fact after driving both I can
honestly say that I wish I still had the NA, that is to say I wish I had
them both.

944
Great for driving around town, and on twistie roads, you get smooth
power all the way through the power band and no sudden acceleration.

944T
Not so great for driving around town, but great for the highway and
waxing the probes, mustangs, etc.... You do get sudden acceleration, but
you can't beat that feeling. This car also handles much better.

My consensus is, I would rathar have a NA for dailing driving, and a
Turbo for fun driving.
Hope this helps you out!
Dan Webb
