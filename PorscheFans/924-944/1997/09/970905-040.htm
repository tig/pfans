More on SO-2s:

I've had them on my 944 S2 for about 5300 miles, including about 5
auto-x events and 1/2 track day.  The autocrossing is hard on the
fronts which are exhibiting exagerated shoulder wear (front camber
is -1/2 degree -- probably needs -1 degree) including shoulder cupping.
I understand that this is not unusally - Jim Pasche in his Excellence
article on 944 suspension setup suggested that the cars exhibit unusual
front tire wear when auto-crossed "hard" (does anyone do gentle auto-x?).

Otherwise, I'm satsified with the wear and am hoping for 15-20k.

SO-2s are great, although they wont stop your car dead from 60 MPH in 30
feet on a wet road when an on coming car cuts across your path. Pity.
Mine are holding up well after 10k miles. About 1/2 worn at the back. I
must add that they get worked out on the open road and I was going to go
to my first autocross on Sunday.

ULW???

I'm in the same dilema.  The S0-2 is the best tire around, period.  But,
it's expensive and isn't holding up very well on Paul's car.  In fact,
at a high speed auto-x (3rd gear) we did in Bremerton, Paul's tires
chunked
where mine did not and we both ran the same times and have similar
driving
styles.

     I have heard that Mobil 1 may lubricate too well when it comes to 
     transaxles with LSD, but I haven't heard about them being too slick 
     for effective synchro operation.  Anyone out there develop synchro 
     problems after switching?
     
     Ben

Ben, I've had the Mobil 1 gear oil in there for about 80K miles now.
 No
leaks (the car now has 165K).  The 1-2 synchro is balky but it has been 
that way since before the Mobil 1.  I have heard stories about synthetics 
lubricating too well which supposedly prevents the synchros from working 
properly (they need some friction to do their job apparently).
