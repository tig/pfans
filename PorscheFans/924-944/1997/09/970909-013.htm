Dear Paul,

In my humble opinion . . .

	I would like to stress that the car's condition should be your 
topmost concern.  Even if the 924S appears only marginally in better
cosmetic condition, that could be an indication of the previous owner's
commitment to 
the car and even small differences in this area would be magnified over the 
130k mi. histories of the cars.  Any car sold by any dealer should really
look absolutely flawless.  I would also suggest that you do some research
regarding the cost of parts.  All parts for these cars, even tiny, used,
"cosmetic" ones, may surprise you with their costs.  A little TLC can easily
cost a pretty penny.

	In case you don't already know, the 924S has:
1) the body panels of the 924 (1977 - 1982) 
2) the interior of an 'early' 944 (1983 - 1985)
3) the engine, drivetrain, brakes and electrical system of a "2nd generation" 
        944 (1985.5 - 1988)

	The 924S is arguably not a "prestigious" car.  It is, however, arguably
a car that has more substance than appearance.  Some people claim that the 924S
is faster than a 944 because it has an identical drivetrain but is lighter and
has less drag due to the slimmer shape and tires.  According to factory data the
924S is 20kg (44 lb) lighter and performance specs are identical so I wouldn't 
expect to blow away any 944s.  When I first bought my car five months ago, i
suffered from "fender envy" and really coveted the front air dam with integrated
driving lights and larger rear spoiler of the 944.  But after 11k mi. and having
seen too many beat up front air dams ($$$$) I've really come to appreciate the
looks of my 924S.  I once read somewhere that the 924S is an outstanding car
"if its appearance is acceptable to you."  I've had to explain to quite a
few skeptics that, yes, my car is a "real" Porsche and, no, my car doesn't have
an Audi/VW engine, but I did not buy my car to impress other people and I would 
say that to anyone knowledgable about Porsche automobiles, an '84 944 is not 
more "prestigious" than an '87 924S.

	In conclusion, a summation of the points I would like to submit for your
consideration:

1.)  The 924S has all of the performance and function of a '85.5 - '88 normally-
	aspirated 944 with the exception of integrated driving lights, and the 
	ability to mount wider tires.

2.)  Considering the cost of ownership of these cars, the overall and detailed
	condition of the vehicle is more important than model, year, color and
	various sundry options.  In fact, if I ever buy another Porsche (I
	expect my current one for many, many more miles) I will look for the
	cleanest car with the fewest options.

My story:  I bought an '87 924S (Zermattsilber, 5 sp., sunroof, cloth interior)
with 76k mi. for $3350.  The car was previously owned by a very conscientious
(but not fanatical) PCA member and had some cosmetic issues, i.e. many minor
scratches, moderately worn seats, broken radion etc. but mechanically very
good.  
I am very pleased with the performance, but you should not expect stupendous 
performance in the 0 - 60 department.  I have experienced 132 mph (far from 
redline) with excellent stability.  I drive the car every day and under all 
conditions. (I will soon be eliciting advice regarding winter tires.)  In the 
first four months of ownership (8k mi.) I spent about $2000 on the following 
items: new 10-CD changer, head unit and amplifier; scheduled belt and roller 
change; rebuilt/updated water pump (not broken, but showed signs of wear); new 
steering wheel; floormats.

One last piece of advice:  Whichever car you decide on, throw away the balky
stock steering wheel and invest $150 in a MOMO or Dino steering wheel.  I
cannot adequately express the impact this had on the "feel" of the car.
On second thought, don't throw that wheel away, store it carefully.  I've seen
vendors charge $250 for just such a steering wheel, used.

Just my $0.02; I hope this helps,  :)
