G'mornin group.

I just wanted to take a moment and update you guys on my weber/FI swap.

For those who did not know, I am replacing the fuel injection system on a
1982 924 with a set of 40mm DCOE side draft webers.

Removal of the FI system and installation of the Webers was pretty straight
forward, but time consuming.  I had to build a couple of brackets to support
items that lost their supports when stuff was removed.  The only real
"custom" item was making a set of "shorty" air filter housings from
aluminum.  The standard units ran into my AC line.

I have it jetted as close as I can by ear and reading spark plugs.  The rest
will have to wait untill I have my O2 sensor "black box" finished.  You've
seen them in the catalogs, it is a little box that you plug into your oxygen
sensor and it has a bar graph of led's on it that read rich to lean.  I
could not see spending $150.00 for it so I am building one.

The car is running far smoother than I anticipated.  I expected some
hesitation or stumbling at low RPM's due to the Weber's catering to wide
open running, but none exists.  The idle is actually much smoother than the
original FI system.  That of course leads me to believe I had some dirty
injectors.  Transition from Idle to open throttle is seamless.

Power is much better than stock.  (Note:  I have removed the catalatic
converter also)  I ran back to back tests with a friends 85.5 944NA, and
they are dead even.  I drove both cars on the same streach of road
alternating from the 944 to my 924 to get good A to B tests.  The 944 feels
a little "torqueier" but when ran side by side in simulated "drag racing",
there was never more than one car length difference up to about 100mph, and
it alternated between cars who was leading.

Fuel milage has definatly gone down.  I am guessing down to about 20 -25
mpg.  The AC system is no longer as big of a drag on the system.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Jay
