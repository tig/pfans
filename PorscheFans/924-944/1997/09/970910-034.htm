First off, I'd like to apologize if I recently sent about ten old messages
to people.  I was switching e-mail programs, and the new one automatically
started sending stuff I'd saved... not good.  Anyway, no excuses, but I'm
really sorry (not totally sure it happened, I switched accounts, too).

Now, on to my question.  I have the Wiring Situation From Hell on my '79
924 right now.  Some incompetent shop was trying to fix the hard starting
problems (they apparently never thought to check the fuel distributor) and
their philosophy on wires was "if you can't figure out what it's for,
remove it."  Consequently, I'm coming damn close to ripping out what's
left of the old wiring loom and redoing it according to Haynes.  (Not
there yet.)

The problem is this: a couple months ago, my radio suddenly stopped
working.  I also noticed that the first day it rained, the intermittent
windshield wipers also stopped working.  No big deal; if the wipers
"stuck" the intermittent setting would bring them back down, and the other
two worked, so I could still drive around fine.

After completing the engine rebuild, during which time I pulled the radio
to make sure I hadn't blown it out or something, I observed that the
intermittent wipers were working again.  Very pleased, I put the radio
back in, hooked it up, and turned the key.  Nothing.  And the wipers
weren't working again.  So I set the wipers on intermittent, undid the
ground from the radio, and the blades immediately started moving.  If I
put the ground back in on the upward stroke, they'd freeze, and if on the
downward stroke, they'd keep going, but slower and audibly groaning.  The
radio still doesn't work.

[This is getting way too long.  Sorry.]

I think I know what event precipitated this.  I've been trying to install
driving lights on my car the factory-official way (that is, through the
spaces left for the fog light option at the factory).  Consequently, I've
been playing around with the fuse box a lot.  However, I'm pretty sure I
got all the wires back together correctly, and I don't see what the
windshield wipers have to do with the radio, anyway.

Thanks for any help I might get...  psychiatric or otherwise.
