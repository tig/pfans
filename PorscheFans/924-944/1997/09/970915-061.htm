	I'm getting both of these replaced tomorrow as I have a leak in 
the clutch master cylinder.  Dealer said that these were not rebuildable as 
the sidewalls were so thin they couldn't be honed.  But someone on the 
group mentioned a rebuild kit.  Should I keep the parts and rebuild them 
for sale or future use?  Are they worth anything?

How much work is it rebuilding them?  On my bike, it takes on the order 
of 20 minutes( if you have the right snap ring pliers:-)

One other question comes to mind.  Since the clutch master is fed by the 
brake master cylinder, will they have to bleed the brakes as well as the 
clutch after rebuilding these?  Just wondering if I'm getting something 
extra here.
