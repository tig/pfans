        Bonjour P-Fans
        There I was flying ( in my mind anyway) down the pit straight at Le
Circuit Mont Tremblant when there was a ruddy big bang ....backfire. As I
pulled of to the side of corner 3  I looked in my mirrors.. no oil puddle
or metal parts on the track... sigh of relief.  The result is  a broken
timing belt and all the goodies that go with it....valves etc.  For
ecomomic and  the learning experience I've become a novice ( is there a
class below novice) mechanic.
My friend Pierre Vezina (a listmember) and I have the engine apart and
ambition is setting in. The water pump hasn't been changed in about 100,000
ks so we'll tackle this at the same time. Is( there is a question in here
after all)  it possible to change the water pump without removing the
rear cam belt cover, actually we are trying to avoid removing the
crankshaft pulley. Is this a possibility?
Merci
Michael
