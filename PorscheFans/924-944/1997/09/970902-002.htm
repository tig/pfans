Ideally, wheels are balanced in in two (all) planes, both the vertical
and horisontal. The wider the wheel, the more important the horisontal
balancing. 

If a balance weight is placed without regard to 'horizontal' balance,
there will be a 'sideways' shimmy induced as the dynamic center of
forces may not be placed in the exact physical center of the wheel
anymore.   

If your friendly tyre shop let you have a look at their electronic
balancer, they may (will) be able to show you a balancer with different
program that either suggests wheight placement on both the outside and
the inside, or, as an alternative for alloy rims, only the inside. There
will be different weight and wheight placement, and generally, heavier
wheights are needed in more places if they cant be placed on the edges
of the wheel and sometimes perfect balancing may be a little harder to
achieve.   

One of the parameters set for the balancing machine will be rim width,
and that number is used to calculate weight placement.

Other things to be aware of when spinning wheels:

Tyres are not perfectly round or perfectly balanced when they come from
factory. They need the rim to sit on to be round(er), and unbalance is
countered by wheights on the rim. A red dot is sometimes put on the tire
to mark the heavier end, and that should ideally pe placed opposite to
the valve (that significantly alters the rims balance - it' usually that
good). 

A bent rim will induce a shimmy that cannot be balanced out, but a
sensitive balancing machine may detetect it and suggest a (unnecessary)
wheight because the center of gravity will shift a little sideways at
rotation. So straight rims is a good idea to start with and even
electronic balancers can be fooled.   

Wheel locknuts made of steel are sometimes a problem, as the aluminum
alloy nuts are much lighter and the difference may create a small
unbalance. The bolt circle of Porsches are wider than on many other
cars, and that phenomena will put the nut a tad longer out than on most
other cars, too. This can be countered by spinning the wheel on the car,
but OTOH, those balancers do not see the sideways unbalance as well.  


Anders Svensson, spinning wildly; eternally plagued (it seems) of front
wheel shimmy and shake...
