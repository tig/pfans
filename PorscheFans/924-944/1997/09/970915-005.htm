I posted something about 2 weeks ago regarding new tires for my 85.5 944
that is fitted with 7"& 8" - 15" Fuchs.  The car currently has 215/60-15"
tires.  I have to replace these tires very soon and wanted to use a lower
profile tire.  My speedo already reads 3-4 mph fast and I'm worried that
decreasing the diameter of the tire will make it even worse - not to
mention higher rpms for a given speed plus putting more miles on the odo
than is really being accumulated.

So I called the Tire Rack.  This is what the guy told me about the overall
tire diameters which can be calculated pretty easy.  I calculated the
rev/mi myself (I hope I remembered correctly that there are 5280' in a
mile)

Size
15"		Dia	Wheel Revolutions per mile
215/60-15	25.2"		800.73 rev/mi		*Factory setup 
225/50-15	23.9"		844.28 rev/mi

205/55-15	23.9"		844.28 rev/mi
245/50-15	24.7"		816.94 rev/mi

16"							*Factory setup
225/50-16	24.9"		810.38 rev/mi	
245/45-16	24.7"		816.94 rev/mi

Example:
(((215x.6)x2) / 25.4) + 15 = 25.2"
5280 / ((25.2 x 3.14) / 12) = 800.73 rev/mi

The only reason I went to this trouble is because I got several responses
to my original post telling me that putting lower profile tires on my car
wouldn't affect the spedo/odo.  I'm not trying to prove anyone wrong.  I
would like to know if there is anyone out there using low profile tires
with 7&8-15" Fuchs.  If someone made a 225/55-15 (besides the Michelin
Pilot), everything would be great because I could use those with 245/50-15"
in the back.  Plus I don't want the tires to look too small for the wheel
opening.  

Another idea - Does anyone know how to recalibrate the spedo/odo or can the
dealer do this?  

TIA for any ideas

Please "reply to all" as I don't receive the non-digest version anymore.
