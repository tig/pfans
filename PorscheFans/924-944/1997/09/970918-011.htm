That is what I thought, but a "mechanic" (geez, why is it so hard to
find a good one) told me that 1.2 bar on the gauge was right, that it
was too much boost and the WG was probably sticking.  I thought for a
moment I was going completely nute.  Mechanics are SUPPOSED to know what
they are talking about!  Now I can't trust his diagnosis on anything.

Bye the way, if you do want a GOOD mechanic in the Indianapolis area,
see Brian Stewart at Autocar Sports and Classics.  This diagnosis was
NOT made by him.  That makes two shops I won't visit for repairs again.
