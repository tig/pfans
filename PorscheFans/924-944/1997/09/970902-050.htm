Subject: $2250 windshield

Marv,

>The price the subcontractor quoted was $650 for the complete job!  This 
is quite a difference between the dealer price of $2250 for the glass 
only!


It sounds like White-Allen priced a Sekurit Sekuriflex windshield instead of
a regular Sekurit windshield. The Sekuriflex has the inside coating and costs
alot more and is a hassle to maintain.  The Sekurit is the normal glass. They
replaced my windshield with an exact Porsche replacement - it also said
Sekurit like my original. It cost $850 for the part from White-Allen.

Incidentally, White-Allen scratched the molding around the glass when they
installed it.
I suggest you check yours before and after.
They did replace the molding, however - I think they charged it to the
insurance company.

I assume you are talking about White-Allen Porsche in Dayton, OH.

Note about my experience with White-Allen:

If you're dealing with White-Allen's bodyshop, good luck.

I had my 1988 951 repaired there this year. It was a disaster. It was a minor
frontal impact, which took them five months to fix. And it is still not
right. 

In my opinion, White-Allen's  Bodyshop does not really know how to fix
Porsches.
They act as if they had never fixed a 944 before - Although I saw quite a few
in the bodyshop parking lot. And their quality control is terrible. Body
panel alignment seems like an optional, extra item to them.

I used to have White-Allen do all my service work for six years but after my
experience at the Bodyshop, I will never go there again.

Do I sound angry?
