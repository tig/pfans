All:

The PO of my 968 had non-OE pads put in my 968. The sensors weren't used
on the replacements. They  are tie-wrapped away from the
pads/rotors/calipers etc. I have been getting the warning for pads
intermittently. Go over a bump and the light would come on or braking.
Today I attempted to resolve the problem by re-wrapping the sensors,
thinking they might be making contact with something. Of course, now the
light comes on when the ignition is turned on. Question is:  If I replace
the sensors, and tie they away, will they trip the light? Do they need to
be seated in a pad, even though they didn't need them previously. I'd
prefer not to purchase new pads just yet. I alos don't want to change
pads just before going to the Solo II Nations, and find out what a new
compound is like.  =8-O

TIA
