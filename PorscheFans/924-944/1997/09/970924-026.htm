Hello P-Fans,

I'd like to resurrect a recent query about the feasibility (= cost) of
upgrading the power of the 944 S2 to the 968 level, and then moving on to
aftermarket power upgrades for the 968.  Basic question is how many
components would have to be replaced to get the additional 26 hp, ignoring
for the moment any changes in the exhaust system. The minimum change would
be adding the variable valve timing device, sensors and activators and an a
968 DME, assuming this is at all feasible. Next level would be a 968 head
and DME. What I don't know is whether the intake manifolds are different.
The 968 has a dual plenum (according to Vivian), and while the manifolds
look the same on both models, I don't know if the S2 has the dual plenum.
The throttle bodies also seem to be located differently, and the
filter-to-throttle body arrangement differs, but this would be the least of
the problems.  

Within the context of PCA r ules, I believe these mods could be made
without moving up a class, since S2s and 968s are both class 9 (as is the
non-S 951, all of which puts the S2 at the bottom of the heap, but that's
another issue).  Adding the Powerhaus package for the 968 is supposed to
gain 270 hp at the flywheel. The addition of an aftermarket chip is free in
an NA model, as are exhaust modifications. Not sure about adding a larger
throttle body.

Comments/info appreciated.
