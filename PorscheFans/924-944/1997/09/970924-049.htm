2. Launching:
   Personally, I don't like losing in auto-x because my car has no low end
   torque, so I've spent the whole year mastering a launch and I think I've
   got it down pack.  This launch is not an all-or-nothing type, it's not
   going to give you that last 1/10th at the drag track, but what it will
   do is give you consistent launches and similar launches to other non-
   turbo cars.

   I get up to the line and rev the engine to get a feel of what the car
   is feeling.  I rev it up to around 4500rpm, once the revs drop to around
   3500rpm, I start to let out the clutch while I get on the gas.  This
   is kind of like slipping, but if done right, there is almost no slipping
   involved (except for a few rotations from the tires).  The car should
   accelerate at a rate that prevents the clutch or tires from slipping.

   This launch technique was so successful on Saturday that I launched so
   hard, when I shifted into 2nd, I had the car completely wound up and on
   the edge of traction and had to make a kink.  This, of course, set into
   action the infamous 944 wag, or the new name I'm giving it, the
   Transaxle Toss, countersteer right, countersteer left, then right again
   and damn, lost it!  You shouldn't have problems like this though since
   most of you use those tame computer chips :) not the torque rise that
   the turbo cup units have.

   Hey, at least I got Best Spin of the Day!

   Next email will be about the conclusion of the racing season from hell.
