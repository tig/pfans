Dear Roxanne

    First a couple of questions. Does the engine ever run long enough to
fully warm up? If so when you are driving along - in any gear and the engine
looses power do you notice if the tach jumps to zero while you are in gear
and the engine is loseing power? If so it could be something on the primary
ignition side of things. Does the engine crank over after it shuts off, but
will not catch? do you smell or notice any black smoke from the tail pipe?
Any repairs done recently just before you started having this problem?
 Please send me/or the list more information. 
  
   When you replace the rotor inside of the distributor cap, did you use blue
Loctite on the set screw? The screw holds the rotor at TDC, the shaft has no
slot to index the rotor. Maybe the rotor is simply spinning on the shaft? 
   Have you check/replaced the DME relay, It is cheap($40) and should be
replace if it is original. When the relay fails the engine will loose both
spark and fuel power - and as far as I know there is no way to use a jumper
wire to bypass like a fuel pump relay. Any 944 DME relay will work of
diagnoses purposes. 
   If you still have a condition where the engine cuts off while driving, I
would check two things first. The DME relay could be starting to go bad -
simply replace it or use a friends relay from his/or her car to test. Or
possibly a bad inductive pick-up sensor. The inductive sensor either works or
it doesn't. Porsche uses two senors located on the back of the engine/fire
wall, above/on top of the bell housing. One is for the DME Computer, the
other is a RPM sensor for the tach. Simply switch the wire connectors and see
if this makes any change in performance/engine power loss?  Good Luck.
                                                                       David
Jalali
