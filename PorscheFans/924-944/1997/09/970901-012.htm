        Stuart Waterman asked if there is any significant benefit to wider
wheels/tires on a non-turbo 944. I have actually been wondering if there
are disadvantages to wider tires under some conditions.
        During dry weather, I am assuming that a wider tire footprint, all
other things being equal, would hold the car to the road during hard
cornering as well as keep the rear end glued to the ground during hard
acceleration in the 951. But what about during wet weather? Does the wider
footprint encourage hydroplaning at lower speeds? I would think the greater
footprint might give water more surface area to pond under, less pressure
on the water to squeeze it out into the tread gaps, and therefore encourage
the car to "surf" the water (appropriate analogy for Honolulu).
        Besides myself, I know of another neophyte Porsche owner out here
who noticed his car surfing rain more easily on wet roads (compared to our
more sedentary, narrow-tired cars). In addition, a third buddy recently
mounted 225-50-16's onto 928 wheels for his 924S and noted it was a little
more slippery on wet roads. For reference, my non-turbo (1983) 944 was
equipped with Michelin XGT 4 225-50 VR 16's. The tires were almost four
years old, but still had a fair amount of tread on them.
        I'm about to purchase an '89 951 (Turbo) and note that it comes
equipped with 245-50's in the rear, even wider than my old car's tires. I
would like to hear from someone with more road experience in 944's who
could comment on the wet road/dry road question.

Thanks, and Aloha,
