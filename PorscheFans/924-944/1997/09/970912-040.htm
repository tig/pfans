OK, Listen...

I love my '82 931 dearly, but let's be a little honest.  My 931 has 
about 80K miles, has melted (yes, you could see the rings) two sets of 
pistons, and has seen two turbos.  Poor maintenance didn't help the 
poor car any.  No, I'm not the idiot who melted the pistons.  I'm the 
idiot who bought it from him.

My '85 Prelude has 185K miles, and the ONLY big problem is a terrible 
rear main seal leak.  The paint looks like crap(OK, Porsche wins hands 
down there) but the only rust is due to a girl on a moped who decided 
to run into me.  And I'll venture to bet lots of 924/944's have 
smelled a little wet when their battery boxes start leaking.

So lay off, mister!  Besides, I've never seen a starship cloak...
