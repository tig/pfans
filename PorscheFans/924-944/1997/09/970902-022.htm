     <The starter in my '89 951 makes awful sounds when it cranks.  A 
     <mechanic
     <(who specializes in Porsches) told me that since it does the job, I
     <shouldn't worry about the horrible sound.  He told me that it could 
     <be
     <another 30,000 miles before the starter dies.  Can anyone shed some
     <light on this.
     
     
     
     Mark,
     
     I'm sorry, but this sounds pretty bad.
     
     
     The only time I've heard a starter make noise was when there were 
     stripped or missing teeth on the flywheel or on the starter's drive 
     gear. (it sounds similar to when you try to start a car that is 
     already running) This can be very serious. If your flywheel teeth are 
     damaged the only fix is to replace the ring gear or the whole 
     flywheel. This requires removing the transaxle and torque tube and 
     clutch. (Which is a very big job).  Replacing the starter may not 
     solve your problem, perhaps your mechanic just assumed you didn't want 
     to go through the expense of replacing your flywheel until you could 
     no longer start the car. He is correct to say that this may not occur 
     for quite some time. Once he had shown you an estimate for $1200-2000, 
     you probably would have just decided to live with the noise for a 
     while. However, it will probably get worse. Most likely a new starter 
     would be damaged by your damaged flywheel, and then you would have to 
     buy another new one when you get your flywheel fixed.
     
     Hope this helps,
     Rod Wiggins
