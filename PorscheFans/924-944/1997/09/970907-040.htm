I just changed the four drive belts and thought that I should pass along some
information.  They were purchased from Don McGill Porsche, Houston, TX and I
specified genuine Porsche belts only, no Euroselect, no substitutes.

The new cam belt #944 105 157 04 came in a Porsche box and is a Gates
Powergrip HTD.  The part number on the belt is 944 105 157 04AE.

The new balance shaft belt #944 102 219 04 came in a Porsche box and has no
manufacturer's name on the belt.  An additional part number on the belt is
047DS.

The alternator/AC ribbed belt #999 192 299 50 came in a bag and is a Dayco
#20-4535, with the Porsche part number also on it.

The power steering v-belt #999 192 241 50 came in a Porsche sleeve and is a
Dayco #42-5899, with the Porsche part number also on it.

This was my first belt change.  I have some comments about the process that I
had not seen in print.  

After the power steering pump tension turnbuckle has been removed and the
pivot bolt loosened, the pump cannot pivot enough to remove the old belt.
 The pump slides along the pivot bolt toward the rear of the car enough to
miss the cam belt shroud flange and the belt can be removed.

AC compressor pivot bolts are at the top, one at each end.  Very difficult to
see.

The balance shaft belt tensioner and idler pulleys require a 24mm wrench,
1/8" thick to hold the tension while the lock nut is tightened (17mm).  I
hacksawed and filed one out of 1/8" thick steel.

The camshaft belt tensioner requires a 27mm wrench, also 1/8" thick with a
1-1/2" to 2" offset.  The workshop manuals show a photo of one with the part
number.  I called.  $50.00!   I cut and bent one to fit.

All belts are adjusted per the workshop manuals.  Being new at this, I
checked each belt three times, after rotating the crankshaft twice for each
check.
     Cam belt                  4.0 +-0.3
     Balance shaft belt     2.7 +-0.3
     AC/alternator belt      9.5 + one turn of the turnbuckle
     Power steering belt    5mm  thumb pressure deflection

According to the workshop manuals, the balance shaft belt is tensioned at TDC
while the camshaft belt is tensioned 10 degrees before TDC.

There is now a slight belt whine, increasing with RPM.  This is what I wanted
to avoid by using the Porsche belts, since reading all of the recent posts
about whining belts.  There was no noise with the old (31,000 mile) belts.  I
will report after the 2,000 mile adjustment.
