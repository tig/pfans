I can attest to that!  I had been having terrible charging problems and 
while replacing the steering rack noticed that the hose was gone.  I 
replaced the hose and my gauge never gets below 12 volts now.  I just hope 
the damage already done is not too severe.  Those hose is about $35 from 
the dealer and is a special insulated hose, I would bite the bullet and buy 
the EOM part and the clamps.  It is troublesome to get on the back of the 
alternator so be prepared to be patient.
