More information on glass replacement than is probably needed.  All glass is
not the same.  Glass has become an integral part of the structural
characteristics of the car itself.  Different glass has different engineering
specifications to meet and pass.  Porsche may have set higher standards for
their glasss due to the different way the car may be used verses a minivan for
example.  While it is expected that the Porsche might see 130 mph +, it is not
expected that the minivan will ever see that speed unless dropped from an
airplane (and with a cd of .7 something it is doubtful it would even hit 130
then).  An analogy to tires is appropriate.  Z rated tires cost more because
more is expected out of them.  Would you replace your Z tires with an H rated
tire?  Same for glass.

Other attributes that are engineered into glass would be airbag retention.  Not
all glass behaves the same in a crash that deploys an airbag.  This is true of
the glass and even more applicable to the sealant used to hold the glass in
place.  I am very concerned about the people on this list who are replacing
their own glass and using a 3M product that is not engineered for this task to
do so.  In a crash, it is likely that the glass would be jettisoned from the
car by the airbag and thereby ruining the structural support of the rest of the
car significantly increasing your chances of injury.

I have had glass replaced on my other cars that was not OEM glass and had many
problems with fit and leaks.  When I complained loud enough, and had the glass
replaced with OEM glass, - problems gone.

You are allowed to demand OEM glass from your insurance company.  If they have
a problem with this, talk to the State Insurance Regulatory ageny, this is what
they are there for.
