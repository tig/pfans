Here in New Zealand ( You will find it next to Australia on your map )
we have to convert cars to RHD from LHD. There are some exceptions
though. If the vehicle is rare and valuable and its value would be
sizably reduced if converted it can be driven with a LHD permit. If the
vehicle is of a certain age, i.e. your grandad wanted one when he was a
lad, it may be kept as LHD. Gaining a LHD permit is very hit and miss as
they are issued by public servants.
Converting a 911, earlier models especially, are not too difficult to
convert to RHD and there are a few examples around. A 944 is a larger
problem. I compared my car to a LHD example. There are a number of
differences, the battery in my car is in the trunk/boot on the left hand
side under the carpet. It follows then that the entire loom is a mirror
image, the list of changes goes on and on.
It would not be economically viable to import and convert  LHD 924-968s
even if the vehicles were free. Most Porsche imports in NZ come from the
UK, and a lot of recent imports have depressed the 944 and 928 market.

Sounds all too easy!!!! But we have a 45% import duty and any vehicle in
Australia has to conform to our own unique set of design rules; plus we
need the steering wheel on the other side! In reality there are a few
LHD
cars but they can't be used easily day to day, so most are converted to
RHD.
Typically converted cars are not popular unless performed to factory
spec.
Unfortunately a lot of loop holes were closed years ago, otherwise I'd
be
shopping in the US.
