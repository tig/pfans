I've had a few things changed on the car in the last while to accomodate
track days coming up (hopefully SIR on the 27th of Sep. and Mission Raceway
on the 13th of Oct.)  Here are the things done or being done:

1. Porterfield R4-S pads put on (do you want to hear about how they feel etc?)
2. Cool brake kit from OG Racing (Jason didn't have them in stock so sent me
   there, what a great guy!)  Not on yet, but should be here today.
3. A problem developed that caused me to be stranded for 15 minutes, the car
   would only accelerate until 2000rpm, then adding throttle would actually
   slow the car down, the solution took 2 seconds :)
4. Ordered a set of Potenza S-02 tires for the car.  I love the Dunlops, but
   I want more overall grip which the new SP9000's do NOT have (they are slower
   than the SP8000!).  The ULW SP8000 is only available in Europe now and only
   in Ruf sizes :(  Anyone fit a 285/35R19 on the back of a 944T? :)

On my local shop's web site, there seem to be some great prices on parts for
the 944T.  The site is http://www.weissach.com under the parts section and
specials.  The prices are in C$, so divide by about 1.37 to get it in US
dollars.

Let me know if you want me to go into detail about any of the above.

BTW - I also wanted to mention that both Wes and Darren did very well last
weekend at the local auto-x, good job!  And, Alex in his newly acquired
968 placed second in A/SS on his first outing, good job.  Alex, we're going
to have a good fight this saturday :)

Farzaan.
