Hiya pFans,

I have a 78 924 with a new clutch( installed myself ) that needs repainted
and some minor repairs, ie brakes, seats, etc.  I can do the necessary
work myself for about $500-$600.  The car also has the original 8 spoke
alloy wheels including spare that are pictured on the front cover of the
924 haynes manual.  The 924 has 150k miles but the engine purrs and passes
emission testing.  I drive the car to work everyday.

The ? , should I sell the 924 and buy a 1985 944 that needs a clutch and
a catalytic converter with 81k miles and a nice body for $1600?  944
prices for 85 range from 4k to 6k. I can do the repair work myself.

The current prices in Colorado for 78-79 924 range from about $3k for
clean cars to about $1600 for rough ones.  My thinking is the wheels are
almost worth as much as the car because they are in excellent shape. Is
this true?  If so then I could sell the car alone for $1300 and the wheels
for $1000 or combined for $2100.  How would you sell this car?  

Comments....

Thanks,
Robb...
