My '84 has the same problem: The speedo works fine, but the odometer
and trip odo are dead as dead can be. I pulled the speedo out a while
back and opened it up (that's easy to say but try it!) to see what
was awry in there. It turns out one of the little plastic gears was
worn pretty bad and just wasn't meshing correctly anymore. I guess
that explains what that stupid "clicking" noise was. Anyway, I messed
around with it a little and realized I wasn't gonna be able to fix it
that day, so I ended up just slapping it back together. Now several
months have passed and I'm growing less confident in the haphazard
"mileage log" I've been trying to keep. I decided it was time to do
something. Since this apparently happens to all of the early cars
sooner or later (at least that's what I've been told), I decided it
wasn't feasible to dump money into a used one (since it might quit at
any time). And a new one is WAY too expensive. I called all over and
noboby had a rebuilt one on the shelf (admittedly, I didn't check
with you guys, oops!), and I didn't like the idea of driving around
not knowing how fast I was going while somebody rebuilt mine. This is
my only transportation. So, here's what I did: I was talking to one
of the dismantlers from the back of Panorama about something totally
different and it hit me to ask if he had any used speedos. He said
"yep" so I asked him if he'd go get one and have it rebuilt for me
and send it to my front door. Again, he said "yes" as long as I
provided him with a credit card number. So, now I'm just sitting
here waiting for it to show up. The price should be under $150 if
everything goes according to plans. C'mon UPS! I'm waiting! Oh yeah,
the rebuilder is gonna set the odometer to my "estimated" mileage.
All my friends think I'm an idiot for adding miles. Oh well.
