Tom,

I own an 85.5 944na.  Although there are certainly times when I'd love (and I
mean LOVE) to have the power of the 951, here are a couple reasons why I stick
with my NA.

1)  I can go through my favorite set of 3rd - 4th gear twisties, getting
everything from that car that she can give.  With a Normally Aspirated engine,
you can run the car at ten tenths on a carefully chosen street without going
into a time warp and risking nearly as much.  Although the 951 is certainly the
better performer, and track time would be incredible, I'm not sure it would be
more fun to drive on the street.  Except, of course, when a Ford motorhead pulls
up next to you on the street, but then again his girlfriend is usually looking
at the Porsche anyway so 'we win'.

2)  Maintenance.  I'd rather take the Turbo's extra maintenance cost and feed it
into my motorcycles which give me much more acceleration and feed G-force need
quite nicely.  If you're married, feed the extra money to your wife and she
won't complain when you put $1200 worth of tires on your car every 10 months

3)  If I owned a 951, I wouldn't have any Porsche's on road that I could look at
in envy.  (Ok, I admit it, I secretly envy the oil pumpers...but my A/C works so
I really only envy the 951)

4)  Insurance cost.  (see #3 about extra money)

So I guess my advice is to go and drive it for a couple hours.  If you're
looking for head snapping acceleration (preceded by turbo lag) get the 951.  If
you're more looking for handling fun.....consider the NA, as it's easier to push
to it's limits and yours on the street where most of us spend most of our time.

Tom,

<P>I own an 85.5 944na.&nbsp; Although there are certainly times when I'd
love (and I mean LOVE) to have the power of the 951, here are a couple
reasons why I stick with my NA.

<PRE>Hi,

I'd like to hear from some NA owners or former NA owners about their =
cars.
I have located a great sounding low mileage '89 NA 944 (bone stock).
Problem is I've only driven my son's '89 chipped 951, which I love.&nbsp; I
think I could be happy with a late model NA 944 (kinda like a teutonic
upgrade to my Civic Si), but I also like the turbo's power.&nbsp; For those =
who
have driven or owned both, what's the consensus?

TIA,
