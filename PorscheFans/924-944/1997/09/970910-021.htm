Hey, does anyone know what the "secret sauce" is that Chevron puts in
the fuel injector cleaner?  I had planned on removing my idle stabilizer
and posting the job to the list, (I was having a small problem with my
idle and thought the stabilizer was the culprit).  I put two bottles of
the cleaner in the tank at fill-up and, after approximately 1/2 tank,
the car was running awesome.  No more idle problem, running smoother,
quieter and quicker.  In fact, I dusted a 928 (mine's a 944na).  OK,
there was a teenage girl driving the 928 and I don't think she was
racing me.  Anyway, I'm sold on this stuff.

Comparison

Ft. Myers, Florida, USA
1985.5 944na purchased March 1996 for $3,000.00(basically trashed) +
$9,000.00 to bring up to concours level.
I pay between $1.45 and $1.50 per gallon of Chevron or Shell premium
gas.
Insurance is $500.00 per year with $500.00 deductible
$40.00 per hour labor / however I try and do the work myself.
