Hello,

The heater in my late '85 944 has recently decided it wants to always be ON
no matter what temperature the knob is set to. And I'm not just talking a
little warm--I mean its like I've got flames shooting out of my vents.

Actually, since its cooled down here in Chicago I don't have this problem
as consistently as when it was warmer out (go figure)--But it still happens
pretty frequently. At first I thought that there might be something wrong
with the switch. But the shop manuals suggest that it might be an
interuption the three temperature sensors (mixing chamber, external and
interior). The only problem is that I have to take the dash completely out
to check the interior sensor (at least it seam that wayO. Before I do this
I want to make sure that someone hasn't had a similar problem with a simple
fix. Also, I'm not exactly sure what to do if there is an "interuption."
The shop manuals make certain assumptions about the reader's techical
knowledge which sometimes goes beyond my current understanding.

I'd appreciate any advice.

-NEIL
