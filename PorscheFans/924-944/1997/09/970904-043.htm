<<I am in a quandary and need the help of the collective!  I have been 
running Valvoline 20W50 since I have owned the car (1.5 years and 20K 
miles) at the suggestion of the local dealer.  I have no idea what the 2 
POs used.  I am debating the switch to Mobil 1 and need some
motivational 
therapy.  I have heard that using Mobil 1 may cause some leaks in the
seals here and there but I also understand that it is a better oil and
will 
prolong the engine and turbo life.  The car uses about 1Q every 500-700 
miles and I suspect valve seals.  Also, there is a terrible chatter that
I have always chalked up to the injectors but I suppose it could be the 
lifters and I understand Mobil 1 may help that too.  I have never done a 
compression or leak down test and the dealer says that I have a small
oil 
leak under the cam housing (with all the power steering fluid under
there I would be hard pressed to identify oil but there is none on the
driveway).

Considering the above are there suggestions, pros or cons?  Will the oil 
make that big a difference?>>

The collective is here to help you.

20W50??? Why don't you just run molasses? ;) Seriously, you will get a
*lot* more performance from your engine if you trust current oil
technology. Speaking of which, I love Mobil 1 and you should too. <g>

I eat a quart of oil per day at the track and I appear to eat a quart
every 500-1K miles on the highway. There are no apparent leaks and the
rear is clean so I don't think it is being burned unless it is *real*
slow. Reports concerning 928S4s consuming a quart every 400 miles are
frequent. I suspect Porsche has recently concluded a deal with the oil
companies to eject it through a special opening whenever the car goes
over 40 mph. ;)

I suspect the noise is the injectors and not the lifters. They really
make a racket if you aren't used to them, but the lifters sound
completely differently. Listen to another 944 and see if it sounds the
same.

Paul Foster
