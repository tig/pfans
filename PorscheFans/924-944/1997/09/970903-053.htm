Many people have emailed asking what the symbol on the first page of
the Germany web site is.  That's the "no speed limit" sign of course :)
The dials in the back are of a BMW 318 which we rented.  That was the
highest it would go when we first got it.  The odo read 1400km.  Once I
had broken the engine in a bit more, it eventually went up to 212km/h,
but you could not drive at that speed, the rev limiter would keep cutting
in.  We ended up cruising around 205-210km/h to prevent that.

BTW - when we returned the car, we had covered an additional 4600km in
Germany.  The entire windshield and nose at one point were covered in dead
bugs.

Danke,
Farzaan.
