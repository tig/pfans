OK, I'll throw in my 19 year old son's car...

1.  Seattle, WA

2.  1989 944 Turbo, $22,000 - purchased locally in August '96 from a PCA
member.  I told my son this was a bit too much money for this car but he
wanted it and since it had the major expensive items already replaced
(clutch & headgasket) and was in just about flawless condition with =
37,531
miles, he bought it.  So far it has been driven 10,000 miles and has had
only one very minor water leak in a small hose, and the sunroof needed a
new gear.  Total expense in repairs has been under $500 for the year.

3. $1.56/gallon for 92 octane Chevron or Exxon.  Runs like $#!+ on Arco.

4. $860/year for full coverage with $500 D Collision and $100 Comp =
through
State Farm.  The car is in my name and insured with three other cars.
Similar coverage would be $5000/yr if in my son's name.

5. $50-60/hour at an independent Porsche shop.
