I also have been doing business with these guys since I purchased my 968 =
in late April this year.  They always give me the best prices and the =
best service.  I whole heartily recommend these guys for your OEM parts =
source.  Their number is 310.449.9292.  I have no $$ interest in this.

Porsche Colleagues,

  When something really good or something really bad happens you feel =
like
sharing it with others.

  I want to tell this group of my exceptionally GOOD EXPERIENCE with "BY
DESIGN AUTOMOTIVE" in Santa Monica, Calif.  My ordering involved both
"Jamie" and "Michael" at that company.

  I have been searching for a REASONABLY PRICED yet brand new 13 volume =
set
of the 911 & 911 turbo manuals from 1965 to 1989.

  After calling around to various vendors listed in Pano, etc., I became
quite discouraged at the financial outlay required to obtain these =
volumes.
I then happened upon an ad in Pano for "By Design," whose prices were so
reasonable that I was even a bit concerned about their legitimacy.  I
decided to take a chance and place a first order with them.  The order
consisted of the complete set of manuals, a Parts Price List, a case of
Porsche oil filters, and a Mahle fuel filter.  All but the '84 -'89 =
volumes
were shipped immediately.  The '84 -'89 volumes were back-ordered and I
have received them today.  Though their price had gone up, they honored
their originally quoted price to me (try to get that deal with =
Automotion
some time!) and they even picked up Fed-x charges for any waiting-time
inconvenience to me!  All this without my asking!!  Man, now that's the
kind of company I want to know and tell my friends about.

  If you're in the market for Workshop Manuals (or parts), I'd suggest =
you
give those folks a try.

Regards,

Mike Di Girolamo
'87 930 Dark Blue

BTW,  comments are strictly my own, I have no stock, relatives or =
financial
dealings with this company, and I stand to gain or lose nothing through
this posting.
