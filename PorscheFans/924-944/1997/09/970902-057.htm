Hello All,
I remember someone asking a while back about the additional chassis
stiffening that was added to the front end of the '88 Turbo S and '89 Turbo,
but I don't recall seeing a response.  Tonight, while playing around in the
engine compartment (mine's an '88 951 S), I noticed a bolt-in cross member
between the motor and the radiator, connecting the front "frame rails."  At
first glance, it looks like just another piece of cooling system plumbing.
 On closer inspection, it appears to be a piece of bent steel tubing which
serves to BOTH connect the radiator to the overflow tank AND to brace the
front of the chassis.
Welded in a sort of a "Y" at each end is a short elbow of tubing which turns
down and bolts into the top of each rail via a fairly substantial looking
mounting plate (WAY too hefty to simply be a support for the tube itself).
 Through the other "arm" of the Y and the main part of the tube flows
coolant! 
Can someone tell me if I'm seeing this right, and if this constitutes the
additional "S"
chassis bracing (or do all the Turbos have it)?

By the way,  I've owned this car for 6 months and 7,500 miles (including a
half-dozen
track days) and today the car required its first mechanical repair since I've
owned it -- I had to replace the notorious power steering reservoir hose
clamps!!!  I've heard a lot of horror stories about mechanical problems and
cost of ownership with these cars, but so far this is the most reliable,
cost-effective, beautiful, outrageous car I've ever owned (hope I'm not
cursing myself!!!).  Granted, I bought it in excellent condition with only
32,000 miles on the odo,  but what I paid for it was the equivalent of a
moderately equipped Neon!  Previously,  I put 80,000 street and hard track
miles on an 85.5 944 over 5 years (on top of the 26,000 it had on it when I
bought it), and while I replaced/repaired a little more than a couple of hose
clamps in that time, it too was extremely reliable and economical. I sold it
for $5500, more than half what I paid for it!
The point?  In my experience, if you buy a good one, maintain it well, and
use but don't abuse it, these cars can deliver terrific bang for the buck.
