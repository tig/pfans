This is just my day for sucking up bandwidth.

Since I bought my 88 951 it has been a bit difficult to shift, particularly 
first and reverse (of course). Pre-purchase check indicated clutch wear 
was okay.  I recently noticed some wetness on the clutch master cylinder 
boot (while laying upside down in the driver's seat checking out the 
installation of my new alarm :-)

Talking to the shop today, they recommended that I replaced both the 
master and slave cylinders, quoting about $175 in parts and fluids and 2.5 
hours at $69/hr for the two.

So, is it normal to replace both (81k miles) if one goes?  Or are these guys 
just looking for extra work?

p.s. From reading all the postings about labor charges, I'm starting to think 
that $69/hour for a Porsche only shop is high.  I had assumed this to be 
reasonable as my bike shop is $60.  I didn't even check the dealer as they 
tried to sell me an 87 951 for 12.9k which needed at least $5K in repairs 
just to be roadworthy.  Still haven't really gotten over that.  Actually, what 
I didn't get over was them 
1) Claiming I shouldn't need an independent inspection because they 
were a "Porsche" dealer.
2) Claiming total surprise at the list of repairs the shop indicated.
3) Claiming they would take the car off the lot but it was right back out 
front 2 days later.

Boy, I'm still ranting, aren't I?

Anyway, thanks for any input.
