I routinely use the front suspension aluminum cross member for lifting, 
but I always have the plastic under panel off.  You can drive the car 
onto a couple of 2 X 12 lumber boards to gain enough clearance for a 
floor jack.  If you make a set of mini ramps, the clearance should be 
enough to remove the under panel.  It might be enough height to do the 
oil change without lifting the car.

Jack stands can be placed under the cross member or on the frame rails.  
The frame rails are sensitive to sudden changes in vertical altitude.  
Lower the car slowly so as not to crush the rails.
