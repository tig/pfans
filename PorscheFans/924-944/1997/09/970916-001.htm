My '89 S2 is running GREAT. It now has 76,000mi. The belts were changed at the 
Porsche dealership at approx. 37,000. They were checked and retensioned about 6,000 
mi ago and were said to be OK. I can hear a slight whine when the engine is warm, 
but not a lot of noise ( not as loud as my "old" 911 ). No leaks, ect, and like I 
said, the car runs and performs great. The car is doing so well, I hate to have my 
mechanic tear into it to change something.. The PO really did a great job on 
maintaining the car in perfect condition !!! However, I realize that the time has 
come to get the belts replaced...

Finally to my question.....After working with Porsches for about 30yrs, I'm a 
preventive maintainance advocate. What parts should be replaced when the front end 
is opened???  All rollers, tensoners, seals, ect???. How about the water pump ??  I 
don't want to have to go back in later to fix something rthat should be done NOW. 
This is my daily driver, and I don't want alot of down time. I want it done RIGHT, 
and anything that might have to be done later, I want done NOW. Any imput on 
possible replacements on a 77,000 car would help me from being so paranoid !!!

Also, I read a post earlier about setting the belt tension slightly higher on 
initial installation, then back to normal at the reset. (3.2 vs 2.7 ?? ). Any help 
here is welcomed. Thanks for any info.....
