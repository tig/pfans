Fans,

Did anyone catch "48 Hours" last night on CBS?  The hour-long show was on
the subject of road rage and featured an excruciatingly painful segment
where two highway patrol officers pull over a 951 for excessive
speed--looked like an '88 or '98.  Very solid front and rear shots.  Color
was dark blue, wheels appeared to be S-type, possibly S2.  I didn't recall
which state they were in, and I couldn't get a good look at the plates.
The driver (I hope he's not on this list) was at first cooperative, but
then began to really lose it big time, at first complaining about his
divorce, then actually getting out of the car to confront the cameraman.
When finally ordered back into the car, he procedes to very nonchalantly
put on his seatbelt, start the car and take off right in front of the
flabbergasted officers.  The camera shows the car pulling out onto the
freeway and then puttering along at incredibly slow speeds, about 20mph,
like the guy was just asking for it.

The cops give chase again and actually start to give the guy a break, but
he refuses to sign the notice to appear, instead saying, "just give me the
ticket."  He takes the keys and hands them over to the officer saying he
won't sign and going on and on about what it is exactly that he's being
pulled over for with ever increasing hostility.  He had backed himself into
a corner and there was no way out.  In the end they cuff him and he gets
jail time.

All this time the camera is panning around the car so there is no question
as to what it is!  It was just unbelievable and will reinforce whatever
negative stereotypes existed about Porsche drivers for millions of viewers.
