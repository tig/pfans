Just thought  I would share an experience.  Called "By Design Automotive"
based on recommendation from this internet link.  Order parts from Jamie,
had good prices.

But had a bad experience on receiving parts ( got some of them 4 days after
indicated) , comunication on order ( did not get return calls after 2
messages, finally called again and found my order was not shipped since
they don't ship partial orders - thought I should have made this decision,
since I'm paying for shipping and my car is out of service wating for their
parts), and Jamie  basically told me he did not want to deal with about 9
different parts worth about $120 in sales.  He told me that some parts were
not available in US, 7 business days after I placed order, leaving me in a
pinch with my car on a lift.

Called my local dealer who is getting the parts he said were not available
in US via overnight mail.  Makes me wonder if that was a bullshit story so
they could spend time on bigger orders.  My impression is this organization
was not real organized to handle the volume of orders they are receiving.  
Good prices though.
