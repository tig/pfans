I seem to remember more tire strips from retreads on 18-wheelers in the
past. But they are no fun to run over. When I see one, I immediately
check my blind spots and make an evasive maneuver. Sometimes, it can't
be helped but to simply run over it and hope for the best. I'd always
run with a belly pan for that reason alone.

I once ran over a coiled heavy duty extension cord that must have been a
200 footer on the San Mateo Bridge during rush hour. Guard rail on one
side and a car on the other and a car directly in front. It raised the
car when I went over it as I'm sure it did to the car direcly behind me.

A woman was impailed on the same bridge when she ran over a 6 ft pry
bar. The rescue squad thought she had had a heart attack until they
tried to remove her from the car.

On 880 right in front of the weigh station around Freemont, I once saw a
hand truck laying down in the middle lane. Shudder.

Regarding the striking of animals, I had a 4' mule deer break the
windshield in my face in a 944. Driving through southern Utah on one of
the finest cruising roads in the US, I came over a brow and found a herd
of cattle straddling the road - they have open grazing and no fences
whatsoever... I learned my lesson and watched for blind spots. A few
hours later I encountered an extended family of deer encamped on the
highway. If I hadn't slowed...
