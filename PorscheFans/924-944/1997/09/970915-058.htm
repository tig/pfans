I've just encountered a rather interesting new noise on my engine, and I 
can't seem to locate where it's coming from. As soon as I start it, it has 
a high pitched squeal which seems to be coming from the top of the engine 
above #3 cylinder. It goes away momentarily when I open the throttle a 
little, but returns as soon as the throttle is closed or the RPM holds 
steady for about 1 second. It sounds a lot like a vacuum leak (the sort of 
sound air rushing thru a small opening might) and seems to react 
proportionately to manifold vacuum. The higher the RPM, the higher pitched 
the noise is. If I hold it at about 2000 RPM, the noise is constant and 
steady. When I release the throttle, the noise lowers in pitch with the RPM 
drop. The only time it goes away is when you first open the throttle.

I've checked all the vacuum hoses, squirted WD-40 around all the fittings, 
checked the tightness of intake bolts, installed a new gasket on the oil 
filler cap, smacked all the various control valves such as idle stabilizer, 
fuel dampener, etc., and even disconnected some of the vacuum lines from 
the throttle body, brake booster, etc. None of these had any effect.

The engine idles a little rough when cold, but it has for the last 4000 
miles. Nothing has apparently changed in the performance or starting of the 
engine except for this squeal. Anybody have any ideas or similar 
experiences?

Sorry I was so long, but I figured it would help to explain it better.


TIA
