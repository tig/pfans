Hi all,

Well It did it again, I have a very ill 931 on life support at the moment.
Cruising home from work last week, going about 70mph, put my foot down a
little to get me up a steep hill and was supprised that the car didn't
responed. So Changed down a gear, as I lifted my foot off the gas the oil
pressure dropped like a stone! PANIC! Engine off and over to side of road.
Engine really hot and smoking! Next day got it back to the garage and
did a compression test. Bad news Cylinders 1 & 2 had no compression to
speek of, Plus there was water in the combustion chambers of said cylinders.
On the good side there is still loads of oil in the car and no water in
the oil. Engine turns freely (a little to freely without compression).

By this time Im panicing, If Ive droped a valve or something then I could
have recked my brand new K26 Hybrid Arrrr!

OK Head comes off, Pistons look fine, Valves where they should be. Loads of
white powder in pots 1 & 2. Head gasket looks fine no trace of water getting
through. The head has now been stripped and has gone to be pressure tested.
Just heard it flunked the pressure test. (Cracked head!) Has anyone got any
ideas what caused this! I would hate to put a new head on just to have to
go again.

Just about to perform a leak down test, Can some body tell me what fluid
should I use and what is a acceptable and what is not?? 

So , And here comes the help bit! if anyone in the UK knows the location of
a good 931 head for sale could you let me know. Im told that the
series I and II head are the same so any year should fit (mine is a '81 model).


Best regards and thanks in advance.

Richard (Why does it happen to me!) Flavell
