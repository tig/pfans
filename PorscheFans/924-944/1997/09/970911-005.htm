Yesterday I was changing spark plugs, cap and rotor when I decided to check
the compression on my '87 951.  You'll soon see I know NOTHING about DME
control system.

I'd been told in the past the safe way to turn the engine over is to ground
the wire coming out of the coil (to the distributor).  I did.

While checking compression, however, on more than half of the attempts to
turn the engine over, nothing happened.  Just a click, and then nothing.
 Repeated attempts would eventually work.  Compression was fine - I was
surprised at how high for an 8.3:1 compression.  Checked at 135, 133, 135,
134.

After completing the job, three of the first five attempts at starting
failed.  Again, a click (starter solenoid?) and the nothing.  Is this a
coincidence, and I have a failing starter/solenoid, or is this a DME related
something or other?

While I'm abusing bandwidth, one other quick question.  I'm sure I installed
the dist. cap properly, but when I grab it and twist (rotate along camshaft
axis), there's probably 1/8" of "play".  It seems on other cars I've owned
and worked on, there's less play.  Is this normal?  If so, does the DME
adjust for the variance in ingnition timing that this sort of "fudge factor"
would allow?

Appreciate your feedback,
