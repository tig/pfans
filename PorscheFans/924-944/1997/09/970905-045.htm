Hello again,

	Got a late start due to "real" work but I am satisfied with the progress.
Thank's for the encouragement and advice, Barry and although I read it only
now you'll be happy to know I already had my labeled freezer bags.  I was
aware of the sensors, since one of them failed a few months ago.  The bolts
were no problem.  In fact no fasteners were a problem because of my new
equipment.  Like a kid with a new toy, I wanted to "buzz" every last bolt
off.  I was very close to success I might add.  I spun one nut from the
exhaust into oblivion (well, at least a far as the road).  I didn't care, I
could buy another - I was happy.  Any of you out there that are performing
all or most of your maintenance on your car, buy a compressor and some air
tools.  Delay that stereo upgrade if necesary.  Do it.

	Back to the clutch.  Three shops in this area have told my friend
(mechanic) that they do not remove the transmission for this job !?!  They
some how loosen it sufficiently to slide it rearward and allow the drive
tube to come back enough to remove the clutch housing.  Has anyone heard of
this?  The time savings are apparent.  I'm trying to get more information
about this so I have done as much as I could in the front of the car.

	Stay tuned...
	

Stu
