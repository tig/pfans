Greetings all,

	First I'd like to thank everyone that replied to my post regarding my
clutch failure.  For the hell of it I called a local P-car mechanic with a
good reputation among those whose opinion I respect.

	Disc - $334
	Labor $480 (10 hr)

	I asked what else he replaces, and he replies that he has only replaced a
throwout bearing once and doesn't normally replace the pressure plate,
pilot bearing or clutch bushings.  He claims that "clutch packages" are
sold to make more money for the seller.  Since it looks as if I will be
doing the job myself, any thoughts on my part replacement list?  Should I
buy a "clutch package" (Autohaus $460, Vertex doesn't answer) or replace
parts that appear to have worn past their service limit?  This is my wife'S
car and I have heard "I really wish I could drive my car" a few dozen times
already.  All help is appreciated.

TIA



Stu

'84 944
'85/1 944
and now '86 924S [automatic :(  ] for parts
