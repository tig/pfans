Doug, get your FOTLs out of your crack!

He did not state where to get the belt done, just that the part had changed and there have been some inferior ones on the market.  You can assume that porsche changed them for a reason , so even the old factory ones are second grade to the new one.

I think the point was... the belts have changed and you MIGHT not get the proper ones at a mail order firm.   MIGHT!  As the the dealer costs with a PCA  discount is about equal to the discount places, you MIGHT want to consider using them. 

Having a couple of wholesale acounts at major european parts suppliers I can atest that the part you want in not always the part you get and as a reseller I've got to watch for wrong or poor quality parts. 

Even then a wrong part can get shipped every once and awhile!  

So look the parts over well before any project!
