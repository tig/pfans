To all who asked:

Ignorance is bliss and working all weekend long has my brain cell
population at a distinct disadvantage. Could you clarify, please?
-Is it folly to buy a fische and fische reader?
-What am I getting for my 7.95? Blow-ups of the parts pix?
	With parts numbers?

-If a fische and reader is not folly, what do you want for
	your fische reader and fische of the manuals?


Regards,

Gary Pighetti

 
I have the fisch - trust me, the catalog is ten times better. The 
fisch is hard to read and difficult to find what you want. The 
catalog is full of tech tips and other neat info. If you have a 924, 
944, or 928 - you gotta have one of these. It's cheap at twice the 
price. It's just blow-ups the same way a Porsche is just a car - 
kinda look at it as micro fische on steroids. 170 pages of every part 
that is available, complete with part numbers and detailed drawings. 
It's not the 4 volume manual - but then again it's only $7.95. I got 
my fische set for free (old set from local P-dealer) and found a 
reader at a local flea market (10 bucks) - but I wouldn't think of 
looking at those with this catalog available.
