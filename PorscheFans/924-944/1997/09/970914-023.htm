Chris,

Try silicone lube to quiet the graunching.  Use spray if you do not want =
to
pull the bushings.  If you pull them use silicone grease.  I bought a tub=
e
of it at the swimming pool supply store.  My Welt monster bushings were a=

graphite loaded rubber if I remember.  If yours are plastic they are
probably urethane which is known for graunching.  On the rubber based
bushings beware of dino products including oil filter drippings (not sure=

about synthetic).  Dino makes the rubber swell and move out of the
retaining bracket.  Then instead of a graunch, you have a clunk.  The
silicone will lube and not attack the rubber (condom safe).  However, it
will not last as long as petroleum based products.

Happy lubing
