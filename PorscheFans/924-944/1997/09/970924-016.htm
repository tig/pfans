Also, just about all of the mail-order houses sell the "Soft Socket"
($26-30).  It has a nylon insert to protect against scarring the finish on
the lug nuts.  However, it is not nearly as cheap as Mark's idea of using a
baggie inside your regular socket (nice idea, Mark).  For those of you who
are "Concours Nuts", you might wish to keep both broad-tipped and fine
"magic markers" in your bag of tricks for last minute touchups (believe it
or not, I was one of those nuts years ago when I had a factory new '83 944
- talk about being a glutton for punishment......).
