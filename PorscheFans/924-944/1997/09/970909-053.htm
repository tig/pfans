I don't understand how this guy can make such a conclusion.  There
are plenty of causes for belt breakage besides inferior belts -- wrong
tension, worn rollers, leaking front seals, neglected maintenance -- to
name just a few.

Is he saying that in all the cases he's encountered, that none
of these other problems were a factor?  Did he personally examine
all these cars, or is he relying on the word of a dealer?  How
does he know that the Porsche dealer isn't going to install/sell 
inferior or outdated belts?  How did he know that the belts were 
after-market parts?

I bought my belts from a reputable mail-order firm and installed
them myself, and I have had no problems.  If I decided to change them
out at the dealer because of this guy's warning, and the dealer screws
it up, what then?  I've just turned my perfectly running P-car into a
heap of metal and glass.  (That's a real possibility given the gross
incompetence of my local Porsche dealer).

I greatly appreciate your FYI, but without data to back up your friend's
assertion, I find the warning to be of minimal assistance.   It would
be helpful if you demanded some hard evidence from your friend, and
then reported back to the list.
