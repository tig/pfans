PFans,

I need to get organized to tune my suspension. Time to talk to the tires
and adjust accordingly.  
Can anyone recommend a good, but not too expensive, pyrometer? And
literature on interpretation? I've got "How to make your car handle" and
"Secrets of solo racing". Any other good sources of info?

I'd also like to adjust camber for time-trials, and reset back for the
street.  My track tires are shaved on the outside, and my street tires on
the inside. I guess I missed out on the mass purchase of the best device
for this task, but what are good current prices and sources? What camber
setting are you all running for time-trials. I've got -3/4 degrees now, and
it doesn't seem like enough.  Also, what is the procedure for adjusting
front camber? The top  mounting bolt was eccentrics on both sides. Do you
adjust both, or just the head of the bolt? Finally, if you do this, how
much does it change other alignment dimensions? 

TIA.

--Nick
