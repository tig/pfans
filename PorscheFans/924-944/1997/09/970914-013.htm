Alright.  I give.  Where do I feed the power lead from an amp through the
firewall to the battery?  I've built an 8" sub into each of the cubby holes in
the back hatch.   I've put the amp in one of those cubby holes under one of the
subs.....I'm not sure this is a terribly idea bright because of a lack of real
ventilation, but there isn't much room elsewhere.  Anyone else think it's a bad
idea?  It's an Alpine 80x2, shouldn't generate all that much heat right?  The
enclosures have a 2 inch port in them and the subs will move some air back and
forth right?  Oh well, that's where it is, and unless someone tells me I'm an
idiot that's where it'll stay for now.  The problem is none of it will work if I
can't find where to run the power lead through the firewall.  Any help from the
stereo guru's out there would be appreciated.
