2. Power steering: did not have a chance to lift it yet, but the
     liquid seems to pour from two sides of the rack, mostly when I 
turn -
     I can see traces of liquid on the road.

You need a new steering rack.  The seals are gone, and perhaps there is 
other damage.

     3. Rough idle - when I depress the accelerator, the engine can 
even
     die, but if I press brake pedal - everything is OK. I would 
suggest
     vaccuum leakage somewhere. Any potential places?

Lots, but check the intake manifold gasket, lower injector o-rings, and 
on the 944S the rubber section of the intake tract.  Also check the 
short boot next to the throttle body.

     4. I can even FEEL the engine vibrating in the drivers' place - 
engine
     mountings?

If the vibration is very noticeable at idle and clear up above 1200 
RPM, it's typically the motor mounts.

     6. The oil pressure is 0 when the car if turned off, 2 while on 
and
     does not depend of RPM. Guess something must be wrong here. Where 
is
     the oil pressure sender located in this engine?

Beneath the oil filter.

     7. Is there a mechanical heater regulator somewhere? It seems like 
     it's just a potentiometer inside, no mechanical temperature
     regulator... And it's getting colder these days here...

There is a heater control valve next to the oil filter, plumbed between 
the water pump and the heater pipe that runs along the engine block.

     8. Is there a place where I could get list of all relays and fuses 
in
     English? Don't read German unfortunatelly...

Send me an address, I'll send you a copy of the English guide from the 
fuse box.

     9. Gas tank - smells like leaking while filled to the top. Any
     potential weak places?

Check the plumbing to the top of the tank, which is under the rear 
carpets.  Also check the filler neck by pulling back the interior 
carpet over it.

     10. Clutch pedal does not release itself to the end - the clutch
     itself works just great, but the pedal stops after that... Will
     bleeding help?

Yes, but you need to use a positive-pressure bleeder connected to the 
brake fluid reservoir.  Getting air out of the clutch hydraulics is a 
bit of a pain.  Try jacking the rear of the car quite high to level the 
clutch master cylinder, which is mounted at an angle that traps air.

     11. The local guys could not find the engine number on it. Where 
can
     it be? The guy from whom I purchased the car said he changed the
     engine for '89, but I still feel like it's 87.

It is apparently at the back of the block, near the fire wall, but I 
have never been able to find my own...

     12. Any other info on this kind of car is verry welcome - there is 
not
     much info available locally and I hate to take the car to the only 
     dealer in the city - they are not doing very well as my experience 
with
     924 shown....

Make sure you have the latest style timing belt in it.  If the car has 
over 80,000 miles, it is time to replace the cam chain tensioner.
