FWIW, my oil consumption is about the same as Paul's. My engine has run
Mobil 1 for most of its 70k miles; I have no apparent leaks, even in the
usual places. No smoke on startup or otherwise, and the back of the car is
clean except for brake dust. There is some oil in the intact tract
(intercooler plumbing), but to be honest I don't know where the stuff goes.

Any other 951 owners care to comment on their oil consumption? I don't want
to start another frenzy similar to the ownership cost thread, but it would
be nice to know what's typical for oil consumption.
