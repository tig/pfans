It is petty nationalism, unless you accept Adolf's roots in Austria as
well, which is, generally speaking, something most Austrians have
serious problems with (for a variety of reasons).  But, that's Ok. 
Excuse my sarcasm.

I concur whole-heartedly.  Don't care where he or anybody else was
born.  Doesn't make them better or worse.

Nationalism sucks.  I live in an international world (although the world
hasn't quite accepted that yet), and that's the end of that.

Anyhow, zurueck zum geliebten Wasserporsche. ;-)

Gruss,
Chris
