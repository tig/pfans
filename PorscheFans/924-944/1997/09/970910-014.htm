Relax, friend, I'm not flaming.  My use of the words "minimal
assistance" to describe your friend's recommendation to change
belts at the dealer was unfortunate, and I apologize for it.  

I was trying to describe the predicament faced by owners who
only have access to incompetent dealers.  In light of your
friend's recommendation, what are we supposed to do?  We're
damned if we go to the dealer, and damned if we don't.

I was also interested in how your friend managed to come to
the conclusion that many after-market belts were breaking.
That's why I asked you to question him further and report
back to the list.  Hopefully you can forgive my blunt manner
and do that for us -- it would be appreciated.
