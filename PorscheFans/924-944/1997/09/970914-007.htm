I have 88 944 turbo that I recently had a clutch job done on. The day I
picked up the car from the shop I noticed a sqeeing noise. When I press
the clutch in the noise goes away, when i release it comes back. When
the clutch is half way out and the car is rolling there is no squeek. it
only is very noticable at idle.  at first the shop told me that it was a
bad throw out bearing. since i supplied the sachs oem clutch there was
no warranty on the parts. lucky for me that same week rear main oil seal
went bad so the shop had to redue the job. I asked to have the bearing
checked. They checked the bearing or thats what they say and the mech
told me that I had a bad troque tube bearing and I needed to have the
whole tube changed. there is no vibration when the car is rolling. Can a
troque tube bearing go bad right after a new clutch job? could the shop
have caused this problem? If anyone have any ideas why the tube would go
bad please email me.
