Peter:
I replaced the gears in my 88 924S, which I assume would be similar.  The
roof lining on my car was not glued where the gears and mechanism were, but
in fact the mechanism actually held the roof lining on at that part.
 However, it was glued farther toward the edges of the opening, nearer to the
doors.  I had to pull that away a little, and reglued that with weldwood
contact cement, which has held nicely.

One thing I would suggest is to pay careful attention to the placement of the
gears in relationship to the teeth on the levers at their maximum extension.
 I wanted to make sure they did not extend too far and put too much stress on
them with the weight of the roof, so I moved the cable to the fully extended
position, and left a few teeth in the levers behind the gears in the
mechanism when I assembled it.  As a consequence, it works fine getting it to
the extended position, but it now tries to retract beyond the stop on the
levers, and will strip out the gears again unless I watch it and stop it
manually with the switch.  People have told me there is a microswitch that
controls the extent of the travel, but I have yet to be able to find it.
