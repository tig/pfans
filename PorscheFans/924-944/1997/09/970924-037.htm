Doug,
I'm a little puzzled at your comments. I thought I made it very clear that
after all kinds of attempts to balance the low quality tires, none of which
solved anything, replacing the tires was the answer all along. When you say
that the problem appeared with the new tires, it's obvious that the either
the tire installation ( balance) or the tires themselves are at fault.
Nothing else has changed, has it? For example, have you checked them for an
out-of-round condition? This is far from unheard of. That's what was wrong
with my Dunlops and no amount of balancing can correct that. I hope I've
clarified my statements for you. BTW, this is exactly the reason that I've
given up on mail-order tires. No local service support. To me, it wasn't
worth the savings. Particularly when you consider that you have to pay for
mounting plus balancing when mounting is always included on a local purchase.
I've been through the mail-order defective tire exercise and it was no fun.
Good luck.
