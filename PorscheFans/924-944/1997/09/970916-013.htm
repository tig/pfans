Wonder what he would say about a 951? Sounds like he might be allergic to water
(pumpers).

Doug:
  That may be the case. However, his opinion, as expressed to me was that he
had two S2 customers with cars with cracked cylinder heads. He's worried
there's a trend and doesn't want me to get burnt. So, he may be operating from
a poor sample size, but his heart is in the right place. BTW, he'll look at as
many cars as it takes for me to find a 'good one,' all for free. Lastly, most
of the PCA guys use him.
Regards,
Gary
