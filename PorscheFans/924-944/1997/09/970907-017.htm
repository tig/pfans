<<I'm looking for a 944 Turbo S (or '89 944T, which I understand is the
same)
or a 944 S2, hopefully near the Seattle area (at least near the West
Coast).
 I'm going to track the car, so a high dollar show car is not the plan.
 Hopefully, miles in the 60K range, something other than guards red, no
big
accidents or repaints, price no higher than the mid teens.>>

Hi Terry,

Welcome to the club (almost). I got my '89 Turbo four months from a
friend for $12K. It was probably worth closer to $15-17K. I looked
extensively for 2-3 months. Check out:

This is a consolidation of Porsche ads from a lot of sources, including
most of the good web sites.

I think you can find one in mid teens in your area without too much
problem. The low end is $12.5K-14K (a lot of which are being sold by
people who don't know what they have), the mid end is $15-18K (which I
think is totally reasonable for the 951S), and the high end of $20K-$25K
(which are usually very low mileage pristine examples, or race-prepped
track cars, or cars the individual really doesn't want to sell).

Good luck and let us know when you have found your new friend.

Paul Foster

BTW, the '88 Turbo S and the '89 Turbo are the same car with the
possible exception of this chassis strengthening stuff. (I looked for
the plates between the wheel wells and the front frame rails this
weekend and I could not spot them.) Most '88s are the so-called 'pink
car' (actually Silver Rose Metallic) that have a 'special' cloth
interior.
