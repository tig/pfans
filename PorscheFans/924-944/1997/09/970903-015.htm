<<I've been looking for a set of track tires (DOT approved) that I could
use to
drive to and from track events (in addition to driving at the track) . 
I'm
looking at BFGoodrich R1s, however I'm a little worried about wet
weather
drivability.  The other tire I'm looking is the Yokohama A032r, which
has deep
water grooves in it.

Since I don't have an extra set of wheels, or the ability to haul my
car, I
have to resort to some semi streetable tires.>>

Hi Christopher,

Go with the R1s. They are a much better track tire and they work a lot
better than you would imagine in the wet.
