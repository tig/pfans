Got a couple of questions about my '79 924, which is finally about to get
back onto the road after the engine work.  (There any stroker kits for
924s?)

Anyway... I've got some questions for the list (some of which apply to
944s as well, or at least might).

It's time for the infamous rear speaker replacement.  I managed to dredge
up an old step-by-step list of instructions on how to get the damn facade
off, but I'm having some problems since some of the directions aren't too
clear.  My problem is this: I'm prying the gasket out of the way on the
inside, because that seems the most logical way to do it.  It also seems
that the best way to get the window out is to push inward.  Is that right? 
Also, how do I pry the gasket out of the way?  I understand that I don't
want to remove it (the glass should come out first, right?) but I've been
warned that some 924s have the window glued to the gasket.  Also, I don't
see how I can pry enough of the gasket out of the way to make any headway.

Next, also on the speaker bit, the PO of my car purchased some bigger
speakers (two-way) instead of replacing the rear ones, which I think was a
pretty good idea.  The downside is that there doesn't seem to be any place
to put the damn things.  Any suggestions?

Also, the P-PO put a dash cover to conceal the cracks.  Unfortunately, the
cover has also cracked, now worse than the dash underneath.  So, I tried
to remove the cover.  Apparently, it was welded on or something, because
the *original* dash is coming apart in huge chunks underneath it.  Can I
sue the cover's manufacturer or something?  Or just get them to replace
it?  I know that all the new ones are guaranteed never to warp or crack,
and this one has done both.  It never fit right, either.

This is a matter of some concern for me, but it seems to be okay for the
time being: the brake master cylinder (the large round object that says
ATE on it is that, right?) is rusting.  It seems to be solid, get a good,
thick sound when I knock it with my knuckles, but it could be getting rust
in my brake lines or something.  Do I have to worry about it?

Because cooling is not one of the 924's strong points, I also would like a
way to improve the cooling of my car.  It tends to overheat at long
stoplights, which is really annoying.  However, I've heard that some of
the later 924's (and ones with air conditioning?) have a second fan,
somewhat like the 944.  Would it be possible to buy another fan and
install it myself?

Sorry about the length of this.
