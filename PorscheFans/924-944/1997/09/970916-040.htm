The chief driving instructor asks, "Who wants an instructor?"  My hand go=
es
up.  I classify myself as a rookie at four wheel racing and take all the
help I can get.

Just as I start to push the envelope on the two high speed sweepers, I hi=
t
the brakes just a bit too late and kill a fair amount of cones.  My
instructor indicates that I can concentrate better without her yelling
"brake" and departs to watch from the sidelines.  Either I had learned al=
l
I needed to know or she finally realized I was the one who had previously=

spun at 90 mph in a ball of fire.  Next time I'm wearing a fake beard. =


In the second practice run, I have the old S2 flying.  WOT through the
sweepers and dive into the turns.  Stand on the brakes, the petal goes to=

the floor and another shower of cones.  I pull into the pits and tell
Scott, my S2 partner, that the brakes are mushy.  We launch into the, "I
thought you brought the tools" routine.  The search for the elusive 11mm
wrench begins.  If we didn't need one, everyone would of had two of them =
in
each pocket.  We jack the front end up, remove the wheels, burn our finge=
rs
and bleed the brakes.  =


The timed runs find the brakes hard as a rock and I have a blast.  Not to=
o
many mistakes, no dead cones and pretty decent times.  Scott and I discus=
s
our runs and how one of our 951 competitors with his new $1200 coilovers
wasn't any faster and had killed a pile of cones.  The old, if we could
just get the money together for R1s and M30, is tossed about as Scott's
girlfriend appears.

After the obligatory kissy face, she consoles him on his continued unbrok=
en
string of second place class finishes.  Scott is a very good driver and
takes auto-x seriously.  He takes no joy in second place. He replays his
runs for her like a sportscaster which is capped off with more consoling.=
 =

Then the girlfriend comes over to me, gives me a hug and asks about my
times.  I reflect on what Scott has here.  She is friendly, intelligent,
interested in what we do and weighs half as much as his ex wife.  I tell
her my times and she comments that the gap between our times is narrowing=

with each event.  My approval of her goes up another notch.  =


Then her eyes sparkle as she exclaims, "It will be so exciting when you
finally beat him".  Scott's jaw drops and I hear the faint flushing of a
relationship.  And they say men are insensitive, whoa!
