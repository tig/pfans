Thanks to Farzaan for the fine pictorial web page.  Seeing the "no restrictions"
sign blended over the speedometer reading brought back fond memories.  I was
over there to visit my brother a few years back (he was in the US Army) and he
had somehow "obtained" one of these signs.  I never asked how.  I was over 
there again last year and wanted to obtain my own, in a completely legitimate 
manner of course, but never found the opportunity.  I live on a privately 
maintained road and would really like to post this sign as a novelty.  Does
anyone know where I might find one?  The official dimensions might suffice, 
as white and black paint and a round piece of sheet metal are the only raw 
materials required for this wonderful symbol of freedom.
