Hey,

I'd like to second Rodney Wiggins comments on the importance of =
inspecting your belts occasionally.  The belts are really easy to get to =
for inspection purposes.  Just remove the air box and about 7 or 8 10mm =
bolts that fasten the upper timing belt cover and voila! - the infamous =
944 timing and balance shaft belts are in *full* view.  Checking them =
every 10K miles is simple and easily done.  You can also check the =
rollers and water pump pulley by hand.  Check for leaks too, of course.

Do this especially right after the belts have been replaced or =
re-tensioned by a competent person.  This will give you an idea of how =
tight the belts should be.

To the uninitiated, the balance shaft belt will seem a little loose =
probably (at least to me it does) but they aren't tight like an =
accessory belt would be.  Just remember the block is a big hunk of =
aluminum and will expand considerably. The belts probably tighten up a =
lot when at operating temperature.  I guess you might want to try to =
check the belts with the engine at near operating temperature to find =
out how much they tighten.  Just remember that all tension specs are for =
a completely cool engine.

I've encountered several people that say that they change the belts and =
adjust them by hand with no ill results.  So I guess it can be done, but =
I don't trust my 'feel' on anything.  (I've stripped enough aluminum =
threads to become absolutely obsessive about using a torque wrench.)  If =
you've got 'the feel', I guess you can 'feel' the proper tension.  The =
rest of us mortals should use the guage - or pay the big city shop to =
use it for us.

BTW, there is a rubber plug above the distributor cap, used for timing =
the engine, but it can also be used as a quick and dirty inspection =
point for a general appraisal of the condition of the timing belt.  Not =
a whole lot of space to see the belt, but you can get a upclose view of =
the belt cogs.  Could give you a warm fuzzy on a used 944 you are =
considering purchasing.

I really think that regular inspections of the belts is essential, even =
for cars with a more common belt design.  When I did the first valve =
adjustment on my '89 Honda CRX, the timing belt was *alarmingly* loose.  =
The Hondas have a spring loaded adjuster and the adjustment is easy.  =
The point is that if I had not checked the belt, it's life would have =
been compromised along with the life of the motor.  IMHO, all timing =
belts 'settle in' a bit and need a re-adjustment soon after =
installation.  At least Porsche admits it.  (Intrestingly enough, Honda =
also prints timing belt tension values on the timing belt cover.  Even =
Honda specs a tension value - it ain't nothing special.)

One final point - it's not just mileage on a belt, it's time too.  I =
would replace any belt when it's 5 or 6 years old, regardless of =
mileage.

My advice only,

J. Dean Roberson
'87 951 - with pretty new belts that purrrrrr...
