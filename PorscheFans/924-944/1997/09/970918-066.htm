Hey guys, first time posting tonight.  Has anyone sheared off the bolt that
holds the shift rod to the one on the transmission?  Drilling it out would
have been the easy part but I went and got stupid and broke an ez out off in
the hole.  So far I have managed to drill about 1/3 of the way around what I
think is the ez out.  my question is how deep does the bolt go?  Does it
actually run through thegold colored rod or just pin against it.  I may have
to buy a new shift rod when its all over.  Thanks for your help.

1984 944 soon to have 1986 engine in it

P.S.  I wasn't foolish enough to break the bolt originally, it came that way
when I bought the  car.
