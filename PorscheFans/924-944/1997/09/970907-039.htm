It looks tight for space, has anyone done this successfully?
It would be sensible to replace all the seals in the cooler while it is off. 
Is there enough clearance for this.>

Alyn:  I replaced this gasket on my 85.5 944 without removing the exhaust
manifold.  Be prepared for a shower of both oil AND coolant, however,
regardless of whether you drained the systems.  As I recall, the housiong had
to be maneuvered around quite a bit, but, with patience, it came out.  You
should replace all the seals with the improved viton types while in there.
 Get ready for a shock when you see what that little tiny gasket costs--I
recall it was about $55 four years ago.  With any luck, the prices have come
down.  Can't help on your other question.  Good luck.
