Last week I put on some new rubber on my C2 rims. I have absolutely babied
these rims and in about 1 solid year of driving, have yet to put a single
scratch on them. I wash them reguarly and wax them.

Problem is now that I have my car back I notice that the clear coat on the
polished outer lips are "bubbled" and "chipping" presumably from where the
techs mounted the tires.

I did warn the tech that if he couldn't mount the tires without scratching
the rims not to bother. Anyone had similar dealings.

I know shops hate working on cars like ours cause many on us are extremely
picky, but if you take "exceptional care of your car" shouldnt you expect
the same from those working on them. 

I don't know much about mounting tires is it possible to mount them
without causing damage?

Last question, since the lips are polished could I remove the
cracking clear coat and put a good coat of wax on them. I have a friend
who had a set of 16" phone dials completely polished without clearcoat and
they still look great. 

Sorry for the lengthy post.
