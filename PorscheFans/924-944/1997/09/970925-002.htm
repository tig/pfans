     Hello all PFans,
     
     I would like to thank all of you who replied my "Help me please" note. 
     Having much less problems with my 944S. 
     
     Was funny to find out the day before vacation that the previous owner 
     did not leave me the key to disconnect the alarm system, which meant 
     that I had to leave the battery running for 2 weeks. So I did, hoping 
     to jump start it after.
     
     Came back yeasterday, started with just a turn of a key. Great car!
     
     Also, couple of questions:
     
      - which octane gas is better to use? I fill with 98, is that OK or 
     will 92 or 95 be better? BTW, I noticed that idle differs since I 
     change from 95 to 98...
     
      - Is there a good Internet source of info about specifically 944S?
     
      - What's good literature about specifically 944S? I purchased Haynes, 
     but it does not have much info about my car...
     
     
     Thanks again and in advance,
     
     Cyprus was hot,
     
     Vladimir
.
