        My 1983 944 with 103,000 miles developed extensive metal fatigue
cracks in the firewall radiating from where the clutch master bolts on.
There were at least three cracks up to 2 cm. long. I noticed this because
one night the clutch started making a clicking noise and I found the cracks
while nosing around under the dash with an oil can. The firewall was welded
and clutch master reattached, and worked well for about 1,000 miles, after
which the car was totalled in an accident.
        I believe the car's 2 previous owners both drove extensively in
city traffic, so the clutch was most likely cycled far more than most
p-cars, putting more stress cycles on the firewall attachment points.
