I removed, inspected, and reinstalled my chain tensioner last night.  I
did not use the pins to remove or reinstall the unit, but I probably
should have, as it was very difficult to compress and keep compressed
without them.

It appears to be a brand new part, and looks different than the part in
the parts manual I have.  I could not find the poly shoe part numbers in
my parts book that was published in '96, and it usually includes the
supercessions.  Hmmm.

There is a little wear on the bottom shoe on the trailing edge, and
there is significant wear on the upper shoe (for a new part).  If the
tensioner were failing to pump up, I would expect less wear on the upper
shoe as the chain would over-shoot the tensioner and slap on the inside
of the cover, but with the wear patterns on both the cover and
tensioner, it appears that the tensioner is being over-extended and is
pressing the chain against the camshaft cover, thus causing the
accelerated wear on the upper shoe.

I will replace the oil pressure reducing valve tonight with a new one
and see if that's the fix.  If so, or if not, I will report back to the
list.
