Dear Dave and fans,
I concur wth Michael.  I own both an 'early 85 944 NA and an '86 951 both
with functioning A/C.  As I live in Phoenix AZ,  this is essential, must
function equipment.  They are both working fine, except for the plugged
drain that dumped about 2 quarts of water while turning left on a female
passenger last month when it got humid.  Both produce very adequate A/C; the
'86 has a little better airflow (bigger vents) and thus does a little
better, faster job.  I spoke to the guys at our local Porsche junk yard,
('scuse me- used parts place) 20th St Auto - they advertise nationally in
Pano.  They said they almost never have requests for the pre '85.5
compressors as they seem to be almost indestructible but have frequent
requests for the later model as the electric clutch/bearings seem to be a
weak point.  There is an aftermarket Japanese rotary replacement available
(see previous thread about 1-2 weeks ago) that I would probably get if I
ever need it.
