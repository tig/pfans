Doug,
     While the wheel is in the air, I tighten the lugs while holding the wheel 
by hand, perhaps in the 20ft-lb range, but I have never measured it. For 
initial torquing, I tighten the lugs by feel, then to the 94ft-lbs, then 
re-torque. I am not sure what that intermediate torque value is, it could 
easily be in the 50ft-lb range. I am fairly certain that I am torquing 
correctly as I have repeatedly measured wheel wobble to be less than 0.003" 
which is within the spec for rotors! This tells me that my bearings are good, 
and that my wheel seating surface on the hub and wheel are perpendicular to 
the axis of rotation. If I had improperly torqued I would expect there to be 
more wobble and/or wobble magnitude changes with wheel/hub temperature, which 
I do not experience. I am also meticulous about cleaning the mating surface 
between the wheel and hub.Thanks for the extra check on my techniques, I 
appreciate the feedback.

  I have called around with regards to how defective tires are diagnosed. I 
have not been able to get a definitive answer. The salesperson at Tire Rack 
claims they would mount the tire on a rim, look for out of round visually, and 
perhaps even put the wheels on a car and take it for a drive to see if they 
experience shimmy. That doesn't sound very scientific to me. I then spoke to 
Pirelli directly, the guy there told me to take the car to an authorized 
Pirelli dealer to have them check the tires out, but could not give me any 
details on what they could/would do. When I told him where I was located, he 
gave me the name of the same place which scored marks in my rims (they did pay 
for Rennsport to fix the damage, but don't really trust them to work on the 
car again). As such, I made an appointment with the Porsche dealer to have the 
tires checked. They claim all they will do is spin the wheel on their balance 
machine, and visually look for out of roundness. I highly question this method.

  The out of roundness I measured is huge! One front tire was out of round by 
1/10 of an inch, that is 1/3 of the tread depth! I can not believe that 
number, it is too large. I therefor came to the conclusion that tires (maybe 
these in particular) have a hysteresis effect in that when deformed by the 
weight of the vehicle, simply removing the load by jacking the car does not 
return the wheel to its natural state. Make any sense? I can not explain the 
out of roundness magnitude any other way. So how could spinning the wheel, as 
the shops have indicated they will do, going to be a better testing method? I 
guess the centrifugal force will help return the tire to its more round state, 
but it still seems very open to interpretation. How about tire shaving? If 
there is a hysteresis effect, do they heat the tires first or spin them at an 
incredibly high speed prior to shaving? If I shaved my front wheels in the 
same manner in which I took the measurements, they would surely be ruined as I 
would be re-moving 1/3 of the tread depth for most of the tire's circumference 
except in the lower radius section.

Wow, this is really turning into more of a complicated deal than I thought it 
would... Any tire engineers on this list?

TIA,
    Ezra
