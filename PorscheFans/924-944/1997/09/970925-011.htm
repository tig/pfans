Tom,
    You make some good points, I have only one autoX under my belt, and no 
track racing experience. I hope to attend more events next year, and will take 
your advice seriously. I have pushed the RE71's to the limit and did not find 
them to break away too quickly, I can control the slip angle around turns, 
slight oversteer with the RE71's on the rear, P700z's on the front. If the 
P700z's turn out to be defective, I will replace the fronts with 205/55-15 
RE71's so my tire characteristics and radii match front to back.

Thanks again for the discussion,
Ezra (always learning)
