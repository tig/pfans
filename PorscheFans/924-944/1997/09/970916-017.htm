Chris,

We installed the plastic Weltmeister front bushings in my '84 944 over a
year ago. Non-lubed. They STILL make the exact graunching sound you
describe. Early on, it bother me some, but I'm used to it now. Even
occasional oiling (as you observed) from oil filter replacement has not
helped the sounds from the passenger side bushing.

I asked my mechanic about silicone lube at assembly time and he kinda of
scoffed at it. Said "that stuff never works. Maybe initially, but  it
just dries up." He's very experienced in street modifications and
(mostly) race vehicles so I (usually) believe him.

Some day, I want to rip the sway bar off anyway and clean, inspect and
lube it all up and then see if it stays quieter, and for how long. But
to tell you the truth, the sounds are cosmetic and I only hear it at low
speed (like up to 20MPH) so I am not leaping to cure this interesting
growl...
