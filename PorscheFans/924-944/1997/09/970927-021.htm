Regarding 944/968 Air bag light on.

   I belive the system is simular to one Volkswagen (gasp!) uses. Since I
used to work for VW dealer I know thier system uses two sensors located at
the top of the firewall, and a ECM at the base of the fire wall inside the
pass compartment area - where the tunnell hump meets the botttom of the fire
wall, and the steering wheel air bag looks very much the same! 
   The two sensors ontop of the firewall always went bad - but VW and its
suppliers could never find any problems with the sensors! They believed the
ground connection for the sensors to be bad! Before I spent $400 plus to fix
the light I think I would try the following:
   1st) Dissconect the battery - and WAIT 20 Min for the air bag ECM to
Charge down - down want any false deployments! 
   2nd) remove the 10mm nut that holds down the sensor to the base of the
firewall, use a good quality electrical connection cleaner. I like "Wurth OL"
cleaner, use a wire brush if necsary. 
   3rd) reassemble, torque nut - failry low  torque (15ft/lbs I think?), and
recconect the battery. Note: I would also clean the other sensor while you
have the air bag system off line!
   4rth) You will need to have the airbag light reset, I'm not sure if the
light will come on when you reconnect the battery. If it is still on any
Porsche dealer or Bosch independant shop with a Bosch Hammer/KTS-3000 tool
can reset the light and read any codes. They should only charge an hours
labor to do so.
                              Good Luck
