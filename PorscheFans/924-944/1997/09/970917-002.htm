While I have owned the 90 S2 Cab for a short time 4 months, I did receive
all the documentation from the 2 PO's (2-MD types). The first was
meticulous in keeping the car maintained by the book and did not hesitate
to have it fixed by an excellent mechanic (Mark Grimley, Beechmont P/A
Cin). While I have yet to meet Mark, his reputation is well known around
here.  The second MD owned it for a short time before buying a Lexus LS400
and needed the space in his garage.  The items repaired were the Clutch and
associated parts at approx. 23K,  and then the belt service at 29K.  The
belt service had the usual seal replacements.   Only other issues were the
Hard starting when cold (Vacuum leak in oil cap) new Dunlop's, and Brake
Pad replacement. 

I looked long and hard before I bought this car, as I was replacing a
Toyota Supra as my prime Sport type of vehicle (I'm sorry but I couldn't 
understand why my Suburban was thought of as a Sport Utility Vehicle).
While these are more of a luxury sport cruisers, the reliability of these
rice grinders is unbelievable (Owned 3, 80k each min. nary a problem with
them any other than Tires and Strut replacements), so I was hesitant.  But,
due to a recent upgrade I my dead president allocation, I was ready to take
the plunge and suffer the consequence.   I must say the past four months
have been great.   It is fun to drive again,  and probably like a lot of
people on this listing I am willing to suffer through the high prices of
repair parts for this pleasure.  I have driven a few 2.5's and (1) 2.7
sized NA 44's and I must say the 3.0 liter seems a lot better in around
town driving,  Decent torque availability when needed, and  I do try to
keep the revs in the power band and don't lug it. (besides, I now like to
shift again, Death to Slush boxes!!)

With that long winded crapola, Take the plunge and buy it.  If it has the
records, is that low a mileage, and you've had it checked out, I wouldn't
hesitate.   As far as the Head cracking issue I can't recall reading
anything about it.  May have been coincidence, improper coolant service,
etc..
