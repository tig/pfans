	I'm paying $2,500 since I'm 19 - (even tho I have no
traffic tickets) for just liability. With full coverage, it
jumps another $2k. I'm using ALLSTATE.  I had a car previous to 
my current 944 (1987) which was totaled (when a construction truck
rear-ended me), I was at 0 fault (sitting at a stop light in fact).
The car btw was a dodge neon. I paid $9,100 for -- At any rate,
I had the car for only 29 days when this happened, and ALLSTATE
decided my car was only worth $7500. So huge loss to me. I decided
to get a more solid car (you should have seen that neon smashed!), so
went looking for a 944.  I decided I didn't wnat full coverage as
they'd decide my 944 would be worth only about $3,000 - $4,000, and
I'd be paying $4,000/yr in insurance :\

	I'm looking to change insurance companys - Is Statefarm
any better?  Or any recommendations for insurance companys (I'm
located in NJ).

Thanks,

jason

BTW: I had a $500 deductable for that neon, and its been ~6+ months
	now since the accident, and ALLSTATE has yet to give me the
	$500 ... *not happy at all*
