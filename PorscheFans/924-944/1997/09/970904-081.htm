I am in the process of installing a new rear hatch seal. The one that is 
attached to the body. The new part is connected, ends together. Does this 
need to be cut to size? I have about 8" too long. The old seal That I 
removed was separated slightly (1/16") at the bottom position (just above 
the key lock. Should this be joined and glued after the seal is cut to 
fit?  Please let me know your experiences ASAP. The seal doesn't seem to 
stretch

On another note:

I reglued the rear glass with great success, thank you for the 
informative posts. I used the material made by Essex #U-418 Quick cure 
primer less to glass urethane adhesive 10.5 oz.

The U-400 is the same material but a rapid dry material.

I did not completely separate the glass from the frame, but was able to 
torque the hatch (with help) while I injected the product in the open 
areas along the frame.(The problem areas were along the top, mostly 
around the hinge sections) I first cut away the old material as much as I 
could. This enabled me to apply more material in the crack.
This is a real messy procedure, very difficult to remove from skin!

You can respond to me directly to: mikehr@earthlink.net

To cut or not , that is the question?  I see no other way!

TIA,
