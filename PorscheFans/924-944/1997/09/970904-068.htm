This reminds me of an old joke email (an aol's diary):

[snip]

 AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT
CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON. 

 AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE
ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA! HA! 
I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES. 

 AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE. 
I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO
REC.HUMOR.ORACLE.  I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE
TIMES. 

[etc etc]

	Anyways, I think if anyone had an offer for you, they'd reply by
now. If not, you may want to make your request for the car a bit broader
in price and or location.
