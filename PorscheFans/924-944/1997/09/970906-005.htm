Dear All
My NA 944 has had new belts and seals at the front and is much cleaner. The 
freshly cleaned sump pan now has oil dripping through it again!
The offending area appear to be the oil cooler below the exhaust manifold. The 
oil is dripping off the power steering pump. The oil filter is clean around 
its base so the oil cooler must be the culprit. There is no problem with 
oil/water mixing only the housing leaking.
Question
Can I remove the cover without removing the exhaust manifold?
It looks tight for space, has anyone done this successfully?
It would be sensible to replace all the seals in the cooler while it is off. 
Is there enough clearance for this.

There is also a small leak at the rear of the cam shaft housing. Is this seal 
easily replaced?

I'm following the oil type/consumption thread, Any recommendations for a 
110,00 mile engine. I've no idea what PO used.

TIA

Alyn
