well i have begun work on the lightweight stuff since the car is not
presently moving (as usual, i think i have been on this list now for 1 year
and 1 month and it has only worked like 5-6 months!)  

removed the backseat, not hard just kinda time consuming have a 10mm (1/4"
drive) for the fold down part, 17-18mm (1/2) for the seat belts i think the
correct size it 18 but i know i had to use the 17 after i made the head
decidedly smaller (p.s. the buckle part is torqued fairly tight, the belt
really is not), you will also need some way of removing the clips that hold
down the lower part of the seat, which is glued in place.  all in all there
are 6 bolts and some yanking required to remove them.  

i now have the rear carpet in the apt. to get all the sound deading stuff
off, kinda real time consuming but once again not real hard.  you could just
take it out all together and it wouldnt hurt much (except you can see the
stupid spare tire bin and the other little bins.  

i think tomorrow i am going to tackle carpet removal. now to the good stuff:

        I HOPE TO HAVE FOR SALE IN THE NEAR FUTURE: ALL FROM 85.5 944

rear seats in excellent condition (black  leather) FS now
front seats, black leather power on both sides (4-way i believe); very good
but not perfect; coming soon
may be persuaded to part with the carpets; most in excellent condition.
(1) space saver tire in poor condition never mounted so it is flat on the
side it rested on for 12+ years
various other interior parts

        WANT TO BUY:

some type of racing 5/6 pt. harness style seats, prefer red or black but not
too picky, must have rails
harnesses prefer red or black
harness bar, don't care what brand
Lexan rear window and front windshield, will also consider door glass as
well (if these are available so also will my stock windows)

fairly poor student trying to fit car into budget but also reasonable
business man so all offers considered.

TIA
matt
