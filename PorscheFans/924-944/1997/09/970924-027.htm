Todd,
It is easy. Get the Hayes manual if you don't already have it. Pad
selection is a mixture of driving requirements and hearsay. I use cool
carbons on my 85.5 944. The CC are not great when cold but are awesome
after a few minutes of driving. I autocross and track my car, so I like
the fact they help to keep the heat out of my brake calipers. I would
replace the pads if you have any question about the remaining life; if
you score your rotors by waiting too long you will be bumming. Brakes
are a good way to get into doing the mechanicals of your car, BUT like
any mechanical work it is your life on the line - if a job is worth
doing it is worth doing right. Don't plan to do it on a Friday night,
wait to you have plenty of time to figure it all out and use the day as
a learning experience. After that you can do a total car in about 90
minutes.
