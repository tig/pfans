I would completely detail both events including the names of the business 
you used and post it here and with the local PCA chapter.  I would then 
print the email and take copies to both shops saying that their business 
practices are questionable in your opinion and you are flexing your 
consumer muscle.  Worst case is nobody on this list will get scr_wed by 
them and best case is they will take care of you in an effort to get you to 
send a second message saying that all is fine.  If you are a good wordsmith 
you could even word the first email such that you have had these problems 
with these companies and will update us with their solution.

Good luck!
