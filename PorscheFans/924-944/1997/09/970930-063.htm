I paid about that for my '89.  The car would have to be perfect in my 
opinion.  No matter what the mechanic says there will be costs that you 
cannot estimate.  Having owned one for a year and a half now and I would 
not trade it for anything but they are expensive to drive with any 
regularity.  I would also hold out for an S model, I think you will be much 
happier with it.
