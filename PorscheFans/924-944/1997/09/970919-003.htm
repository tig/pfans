Ian,

I just replaced mine yesterday (total cost $1.16). 
Wish all repairs were this cheap (ha!ha!)

I only had to replace my temp-mix-flapper-linkage-to-
control-motor bearing (when you buy the plastic
bearing, buy the metal tab washer as well).  

I'll try to explain what I did for the temp mix linkage (If
you need info on other, let me know and I can look it
up in the manual).  Also,  you should be under the
dash when you do this so you are going to have to
feel around for everything:

1.  Remove the rest of the plastic bearing (if any) from
the control motor and install the new one.  

2.  Set your temp knob max cold. 

3. Turn the key to the first setting which will turn on
accessories (same position as if you were going to
remove the sun roof).  You should hear the fresh air
motor blowing at low speed.

4.  Observing the initial angle of the linkage when it is
connected to the control motor, push the flapper up
until it stops.  Place the linkage into the plastic bearing
(make sense?)

5.  Push the defrost button and observe.  The control
motor should be pushing the baffle flapper up and the
temp mix linkage down which allows hot air in (it is
actually pretty neat to what this).  The fresh air blower
will be at full speed.

6.  Turn off the defroster and the you should see the
control motor setting the flappers so that cool air
comes from the vents.

7. Turn off and remove key.  Now take the tab washer
and place OVER plastic bearing.

It took me about 10 minutes, of which 5 of them was
reinstalling the cover.

Hope this helps!
