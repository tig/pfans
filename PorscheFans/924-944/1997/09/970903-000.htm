i was minding my own business , just surfing the web a little , not even
seriously looking and happened upon a 944 ad for an 83 with 90k , 17inch
wheels (real pretty), "runs good" , auto (be nice all), a/c , p/w, leathe=
r
elect seats, nice stereo..
since i've convinceD my fiancee' that she "needs" a 944 , we called on it=

=2E(happened to be with in two hours). same day we go see it, it needs a
right
front fender, the power windows dont go down (fuse/relay?), a/c needs
charging, batterys toast, and definately paint.(was red, they made it blu=
e
(bad job), i will make it red again), rest is actually pretty nice, motor=

is
strong , shifts well, alternator belt slips (warning sign?).
steering is stiff (the wide tires or ??) =

kelley blue book (www.kbb.com) shows a high of $5245 and a low of $2135,
whats the concensus?, how much is this car worth??  im making an offer on=

it
as soon as i have the tittle /vin number researched to verify the miles. =

opinions welcome, at under $3K i think i stepped in it?!?, but am i
slipping
on it instead??? coments please....:)
thanks,

Eric,

If you want to keep your fiancee, run, do not walk, far away from this do=
g.
 Even if you pick it up for $1000, your will dump more than the cost of a=

well maintained 944 into it.  Your fiancee doesn't want to drive a piece =
of
crap while you are fixing it up.  Find a 944 in the best shape you can an=
d
pay top dollar for it.  You will be money ahead in the long run.

I tried this once with a old Volvo 1800s.  I still have the wife, the car=

and a dent in the top of my head.  Women and cars you are fixing up do no=
t
go together.
