[ my apologies if this gets on the list twice, the listserver bitched at
me about the email address that I was sending this from.. *sigh* ]

>Hi guys:
>
>Colorado has been rather chilly and wet over the past couple of days,
>and I observed something on my '86 951, which might be interesting for
>the neverending "which oil is right" debate.
>
>At the last oil change, the dealership used 20W-50 Castrol GTX instead
>of the supplied 5W-30 Mobil 1... Grrrr, morons.
>
>During the past couple of days, during the cooler mornings (40-50
>degrees F), my 951 was very unhappy when started: It ran rather rough,
>almost like it was about to choke.  Subsequently, the engine idled
>rather high at 1200-1500rpm.  Until it was at normal operating temps,
>things were rather rough and sluggish between 1500 and 3000 rpm.  Then,
>once warmed up to close to normal operating temps, everything seems
>rather normal.
>
>Now, this morning wasn't any different than the past couple of the
>days.. except that Sunday, yesterday, I had changed the oil to Mobil 1
>5W-30 and the car just purrs from the start, nearly as excessive
>sluggishness, and everything's just great.
>
>So, as for me, I will not run anything else than Mobil 1 5W-30.  The car
>isn't leaking any oil,  runs just great, consumption is minimal over a
>3000 mile period.
>
>IMHO, you don't need arctic temps to notice a difference in oils.  I for
>one am sticking with Mobil 1 5W-30, and intend to make starts and
>everything else as easy as possible for my baby.
>
>Just thought someone might care. ;-)

>Cheers,
