I have the standard suspension.  The only upgrades I have made is to the =
big (S4) calipers and I'm using the 89 944T rotors (304 x 32 mm).  =
They're cheaper than the drilled M030 rotors and have less of a tendency =
to crack.  (All cross-drilled rotors have a greater tendency to crack =
than a solid or vented rotor.)  And to 17" wheels.  My track wheels are =
Forgeline 8x17 and 9.5x17.  I recently drove the M030 and it feels far =
too stiff for street use.

I am using Porterfield pads in the racing compound for track and street. =
 Once you get use to stopping of the race pads it is difficult to go =
back to a street compound.  I tried this and it felt like I didn't have =
any brakes.  I was astounded by the difference so I stick with the race =
pads.  The first couple of stops, as the pads heat up, are less than =
optimal but still far better than the street pads.  And after you have =
them heated up the track pads are GREAT!

Best of luck & keep it on the track!

P.S.   What track are you running?

Thanks for the feedback!  I have the standard 968 suspension with the
optional 17" light alloy wheels.  The brake fluid I am using is Motul =
600
racing fluid designed for ABS brakes. =20

Brake Specs - 968 from technical spec book:
            Frt    Rr
Standard    298mm  245mm  vented disks
M 030       304mm  245mm  vented, perforated disks=20

Is your's a M030?  Are you running a track pad, or regular street brake =
pads?

Thanks again - Gary
