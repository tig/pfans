Mike -- A couple of questions.
What wheel widths are you running in the rear? And you sense much change =
in
stopping power with the brake upgrade? Think you're doing things the =
stock
items couldn't handle?


[Michael G. Wachholz] =20

My wheel sizes are 8x17 front and 9.5 x 17 rear.  I do not feel a change =
in stopping power however I do not experience the fade after 5 or 6 laps =
I previously had.  I think the car as it sits is capable of doing faster =
lap times.  I do not plan on changing the suspension in the foreseeable =
future.  I drive the car everyday on the street and there are places in =
town where the stock suspension will rattle the fillings out of your =
teeth.

What do you think accounts for your increased comfort on high-speed
sweepers? I definitely had a comfort problem at the Pikes Peak road =
course,
which has a very long sweeper. I kept waiting for the rear end to break
loose.  Did your increased comfort have anything to do with wider tire =
in
the back?

I think the comfort level comes from two things:  One, I have driven =
this track a total of 17 days this season and 8 days last season.  I =
have been slowly increasing up speed through 1 & 2 and feeling the =
manner in which the car responds to the additional velocity.  I will =
state, however, turn 2 still gives me the willys.  The nastiest =
incidents have occurred in turn 2 and if something happens there you're =
not driving the car home.  Two, my aggressiveness might be construed by =
some as lack of good common sense.  I have been trying to learn a lot =
this season, my first with a Porsche, and I have pushed the limits of =
myself hard, asked a lot of questions and had some extremely talented =
instructors which I have tried to listen to and learn from.

From what I have heard of Pike's Peak, I think it would be a track I =
would not have a great deal of comfort with.  I have driven Blackhawk =
Farms in Illinois, Road America in Wisconsin and heartland Park in =
Kansas.  After two days, I was still uncomfortable with Heartland Park =
due to what I felt was a lot of concrete and little run-off in a number =
of corners.

Weren't you going to a time trial here soon?  If so, what track are you =
driving?  My season is not over.  I will be at Blackhawk Farms 10/11,12, =
Mid-Ohio 10/18,19, Pocono 10/25,26 and Texas Motor Speedway 11,15,16.

Maybe I'll see you at one of these events.

Michael
