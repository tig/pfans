How hard is it to change a wheel bearing?  What tools do I need?

Dana


Hey Dana,

Just did my wheel bearings on my 87 924S.  After getting it in the air and 
wheels off, pull (19mm I think) and hang the calipers.  Gently tap the 
bearing caps off with a flat headed punch (I also had the speedo cable 
w/clip on driver's side).  The bearings are held on by a clamp with a allen 
head bolt. Loosen the bolt and you can then unscrew the clamp.  Gently pull 
on the hub until the flat washer and outer bearing are almost to the end of 
the threads then push the hub back in so that you don't drop them on the 
ground.  Pull the flat washer and bearing out and then pull the hub off. 
 Remove the grease seal (don't even think about using the old ones unless 
recently replaced) and pull out the inner bearing.

Now for the slow and careful part.  First, clean all the old grease off so 
that you can see what you are doing.  Set the hub on a nice solid piece of 
wood and gently tap the races out using a flat headed punch (the outer race 
from the back and the inner from the front) going around in 90 degree 
increments.  Save the old races.  Clean again.  Put the new race in its 
place, and using the old one on top (takes the beating off the new race) 
gently tap or press until it is seated  (a dentist's mirror helps).  You 
may have to tap the old race back out.  Also, be careful when doing the 
inner race so that you do not push the wheel studs out! (experience)  Pack 
the bearings in grease.  I used a tool that distributes the grease 
uniformly throughout the bearing, but I am sure that it can be done by hand 
making sure that the bearing is spun gently so that the grease is 
thoroughly worked into the bearing.  Insert the greased inner bearing and 
tap in the new grease seal.  Gently slip the hub on the spindle (you don't 
want to ding the grease seal) and put the greased outer bearing and flat 
washer back on and tighten the clamp.

Now for the tricky part!  The manual talks about tightening the bearing so 
that the flat washer can be "deflected" with a screwdriver (But not "pried" 
from the edge) so that the bearing is neither too tight or loose.  This is 
one of those situations where it is impossible for me to understand until I 
have my hands on it!  When I realized that the washer was a very loose fit 
on the spindle, I understood what they meant.  I started by tightening the 
clamp fairly tight with  a pair of channelocks and then gradually backing 
off until I could reach into the hub with a flat bladed screwdriver and 
move the washer (front to back or up and down) without using the shaft of 
the screwdriver wedged against the side of the hub.  I had them checked by 
a friend who is a very old time mechanic and he pronounced them "perfect." 
 Tighten the allen head bolt, replace the calipers (I assume you checked 
the pads and rotors while you could) and wheels.

A few days later, I pulled the wheels and checked the bearings.  One side 
was loose!  I retightened it using the method described above (nice part 
was that I didn't need to pull the caliper).  When I asked my friend the 
mechanic what happened, he told me that I probably had not seated the 
race(s) all the way, and the nature of a tapered roller bearing is such 
that they finally seated themselves.  Apparently he was right because after 
a couple of hundred miles they are just right and the car tracks absolutely 
"true" at 100mph.

Sorry for the BW and if you have questions, I can be reached at
