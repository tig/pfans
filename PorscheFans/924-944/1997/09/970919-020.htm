 Hi all;

Here's my $0.02 on severa recent discussion topics (if anyone cares to read).

$10,500 for an '86 944 Turbo in excellent shape is a fair price.  $12,500 is
too much in my opinion, especially since it will need a waterpump, clutch
and motor mounts in the near future if they have not been replaced.  I have
seen '88 and '89 Turbos going for this low in some parts of the country.

Stock boost on non-S cars is 0.75 bar.  This corresponds to a reading of
1.75 on the gauge plus or minus the error in the guage.  Remeber, the thing
on the dash is a manifold pressure gauge, not a boost gauge.

I had the heater bearing fail on my car also.  To fix it, set thetemperature
control knob to its coldest setting with the car running.  Push up on the
control lever to fully close the flapper valve.  Snap the threaded part of
the rod into the plastic bearing.  There should also be a little metal clip
that goes over the opening of the plastic bearing to stop it from spreading.
This slides on from on end.  Trying to snap it on over the bearing may break
the plastic bearing.  This piece is not totally necessary so do not worry if
you lost it somewhere along the way.
