>1) What is the rate for one lap?

If I remember correctly, it was either DM15 or DM35.  I think it was
DM15.  You can also buy these coupon books that they stamp when you go
through the entrance.

>2) What does the Ring Taxi cost?

It cost us DM120.  You can take three people though, so we had Paul,
myself and Mark.  It cost us each DM40, which is like US$20 per person for
the ride of your life.

>3) Is the Ring Taxi driver married?

I'm not sure, but she is a REAL touring car driver and she speaks english.

>4) Does she have any sisters?

:)

>5) What does the 944T have over front headlights?

Those are the headlights.  The owner removed the pop ups and installed
the inlaid ones.

>6) Did you drive your rental car on the track? 

No.  The agreement specifically states Hockenheim and the 'Ring as NOT
being allowed :)  There was quite a bit of traffic on the track too,
but more importantly, that is one scarey track.

>7) Do they allow rental cars on the track?

They allow ANYTHING on the track.  In all of Germany, the country seems
to run on "let your common sense keep you alive".  You can do anything
in Germany.

>8) What does it cost to rent a 993 by the day in that area?

If I remember correctly, it is US$270 a day for a new 993.

Farzaan.
