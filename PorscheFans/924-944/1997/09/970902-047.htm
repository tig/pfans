| I've been looking for a set of track tires (DOT approved) that I could use to
| drive to and from track events (in addition to driving at the track) .  I'm
| looking at BFGoodrich R1s, however I'm a little worried about wet weather
| drivability.  The other tire I'm looking is the Yokohama A032r, which has deep
| water grooves in it.
| 
| Since I don't have an extra set of wheels, or the ability to haul my car, I
| have to resort to some semi streetable tires.
| 
| Any help? (or interest)

I sometimes do this with my R1's for nearby tracks (i.e. <= 1 hour), but
for longer trips, I haul them and swap tires at the track.  R1's in the
rain are no fun at all (especially after what little tread there is
wears away), but if you keep the speed down and realize that they'll
hydroplane with the least bit of provocation, you can get to the track
and back OK. Also be aware that track tires aren't going to be as
forgiving about running over the odd nail or broken glass...

I'd urge you to keep an eye out for a set of cheap set of cosmetically
challenged phone dials and put the track tires on a dedicated set of
wheels. If you use this car for anything other than driving to/from/on
the track, the track tires are really not very practical.

An alternative is to consider the Toyo Proxy R -- they're a race
compound tire that actually has some tread. We use them for rain tires
on the IT Mazda. On shaved Toyo's, lap times are in the same ballpark as
R1's or Kuhmo's. But the asymetric sidewall construction of the R1 is
really nice for a street car where you can't crank in lotsa camber.
That's why I use them on my 951.

You can easily haul the extra wheels in your 944 -- that's one of the
coolest things about the 944: I can fit all four wheels and tires, a
floor jack, a few bags 'o tools and miscellany, plus a cooler,
and... Try that in a 911 :-)
