Hello Fellow Porsche Fans,

It was a chilly morning here in the D.C Metro area when I decided to turn
on the heat.  I set the temperature control to 27C.  Just as suspected,
warm heat came through the vents.  Well, later on in the day, it was
rather warm so I decided to true off the heat so I set the temperature
control to full cold and wouldn't you know it, HOT air came through the
vents.  Playing with all the climate control knobs did absolutely nothing!
Even turning on the AC did nothing!

Time to get the manuals out!  The manual has a few troubleshooting
steps if heat comes continuously from the vents.  It basically has you
measure the resistance of all three temp sensors (outside, inside and
mixing) and has you compare them with what they should be around 0,
10 and 20 degrees C.  I was getting 7.4K, 6.3K and 4.2K respectively
(25C = 10K).  Since they are not reading a short or open, I'm sure they
are O.K.  I ran out of time and after further reading the manual, I decided
the next best thing was to get some advice from the list.

Sure enough, this morning almost unbearable heat came out until I was
almost at work.  All of a sudden, I noticed cool air coming through.  Now
everything is back to normal, even the AC.  What gives?  I  may have
imagined it but the first thing I noticed prior to cool air was noise which
sounded like flappers adjusting from under the dash.  Was something
stuck or not getting signal from the DME or climate control switch?

I know  somebody on the list had the same problem and can't remember
the outcome or the advice that was given, so any advice given now
would greatly be appreciated. 

Thanks
