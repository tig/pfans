     I just installed the hella h-4 conversion on my 951. Tremendous 
     improvement. $38 a piece. Much more courteous to oncoming traffic.   
     
     I know there was a thread about this about a month ago, but what was 
     the consensus on whether or not a relay is required to run the 80/100 
     watt bulbs?  I'm guessing the European cars used higher wattage bulbs. 
     I didn't see a factory relay used on the headlight circuit, but there 
     are individual fuses for high and low, left and right. Fused at 7.5 
     amps each I figure I'd blow fuses before I would melt the switch. My 
     questions are:
     
     Has anyone had problems using the higher wattage bulbs?
     
     Did the euro cars use them, if so are the harnesses different?
     
     Does anyone know how many amps a 100 watt bulb draws?
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Rod Wiggins

     By the way, the new automotion catalog mentions that DOT LEGAL H-4 
     conversions are now available. No more information than that, it just 
     says call for details.
