OK all you PFans (especilly Kevin, Don, etc.), here's one for you.  I just
bought and brought home a '93 968, 6 spd Coupe.  It is in excellent shape
with just 19K miles since new.  It is somewhat unusual in that it is a paint
to sample car (Tahoe Blue Metallic), a brilliant sky blue metallic that is
unlike any other Porsche color I have seen in over 30 years of Porsche
ownership.

The car was ordered with a factory installed rootwood shift knob/lever in
place of the one piece leather knob/boot.  My concern is the way the shift
action "feels".  It is much more mechanical and undamped compared to other
944/951's  that I have owned.  It's feel is that the shift/synchro action
comes directly through to your hand with no isolation whatsoever.

Yesterday I drained the transaxle and refilled it with Redline Synthetic
75/90 GL-5 with no real change in feel or action.  The shift action is
precise with no slop, free play or other unusual noises, vibrations, etc so
I'm confident (as is my mechanic) that there is no "internal" problem, but
we're at a loss to explain it's different feel.

I am aware that the 968 is an entirely different transaxle from the 944/951
and remeber it feeling different in other 968's I have driven in the past.
 Is it the shift knob?  What else can anyone suggest that I check?  Is there
a different fluid (SWEPCO ? etc.) perhaps that might provide different
feel/response?  Any and all replies will be appreciated and I promise I will
post the outcome/solution of this situation as it develops.

P.S.
