Hi everyone,

Hopefully, this is the last posting in a series dealing with my now 
non-starting 944 affectionately nicknamed 'Lurch'.

As most of you loyal readers recall, my car was inexplicably stalling, 
lurching, and 'flooding' randomly. Well, after having my mechanic change 
the oil, change the fuel filter, check the fuel pump, change the spark 
plugs, tune the engine, and then tell me; " Well, we can't really find 
what's wrong, so just drive it a while and take notes. You know, if it 
comes back in tow, then we know there is a real problem." Not to 
reassuring... especially from a Porsche certified dealership/mechanic.

To make a long story short, I had CAA tow my car in on Saturday. Later that 
day I got the dreaded call... "It looks like we will have to replace the 
control unit... this will cost you about $ 1,300.00 - $ 1,600.00." 
ACKKKKK!!!! All I could think of was why the hell didn't you idiots find 
this the first time!

Fortunately, fellow Porsche Fans' have been really great in coming up with 
other possible reasons for my cars reaction. The most popular has been the 
failure of the DME relay.

My question is: (1) Does replacing the control unit seem a bit too much? 
And (2) does anyone know where I can get one for less (don't forget that 1 
U.S. dollar = 1.35 Canadian dollars).

Thanks again,

Jonathan Arnold
