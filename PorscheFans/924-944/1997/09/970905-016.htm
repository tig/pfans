Hey,

I've read in several places that the Porsche manufactured transaxle in =
all 924 models is stronger than the Audi manufactured 944/951 units.  =
Most sources state that the 944 unit can only stand about 375 HP before =
breaking.  That doesn't seem like a lot of safety factor for a 951, =
especially one turned up a bit.  It definately doesn't seem to go along =
with the German tendency to over-engineer.

My question is: Has anyone ever tried to put a 924 transaxle (or 968 for =
that matter) in a 944?  Is it feasible?  Does it make sense?  And =
lastly, how strong is a 924 transaxle?

Just curious....

Dean
'87 951 - 55.5K miles - Getting to drive it today for a change.  The =
weather in Georgia today is fantastic!   Just couldn't resist driving it =
to work.
