I'm looking for advice regarding some glues to use.  I remember seeing a 
comprehensive post from someone who works at 3M.  Maybe you have 
some ideas?

1) Body Side Molding
-  I need to glue back the small piece of protection molding that goes 
behind the driver door.  It is all there, including the rubber strip but the 
adhesive has failed.  I'm hoping for something which bonds but doesn't 
bond so well that it rips the paint off if it fails again.

2) Rear Carpet Support Fiberboard Pieces
-  I need to glue back the fiberboard pieces which make the "tops" of the 
fender wells back onto the back of the carpet.  Since there is old, 
decomposing foam insulation on the back of the carpet and the top of the 
fiberboard pieces, I presume I'll need some type of "thick" glue so that I 
don't just bond the top of the foam to the top of the foam and have them 
fall off.

Any ideas?
