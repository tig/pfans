The wheel locks weigh ~120gm as compared to ~60 for the regular nuts, if
memory serves me right.  The difference is considerable and I found that
the placement did make a great difference on my 87 944S.

The crest idea only has to do with looks, just a thing you do when you
enter the car at a concours competition.
