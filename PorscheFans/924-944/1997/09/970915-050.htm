Hi, I have am '86 951. From the chart that is in the 944 FAQ. I learned that my 
car has a 10.6mm offset in the front & 23.3mm offset in the back. I would like 
to put C2 Turbo 17" wheels on it, but I am under the impression that my car has 
the wrong offset for these wheels. The correct offset would be 52.3mm front and 
back. In order to increase my offset I need spacers and studs, right? They will 
probably have to be custom spacers. Does anyone know of a company that makes a 
good quality spacer that will fit my car?  or should I just upgrade my hubs to 
the '87 & up style? I also want to eventually upgrade by calipers and rotors 
with to '96 Turbo "Big Reds" will they fit behind the '86 & '87 phone dials? or 
will they require 17" wheels? Any advice would be appreciated.
