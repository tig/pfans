I bought an '86 951 last week in Campbell for just under $8K.  The car is
in VERY GOOD shape, has 100K miles, a rollbar and harnesses (a plus to me),
and was raced once.  I had the car checked out, and it is mechanicaly
sound.  I took the car out on Buttonwillow last weekend, and it did great!
I think $14.5K is a bit steep despite the low miles.  I think $10K would be
more in the realistic ball-park.  Warranties for used cars are worth ALMOST
nothing.  Don't let this effect you purchase at all.  I was forced to get
one on my '89 M3 which I got 3 years ago.  It was a three year warranty,
and guess how many times it got used......NEVER.

I have also seen '87 951s advertised in the $7K range, but I didn't look at
any of them....I wanted an '86 or an S model...
