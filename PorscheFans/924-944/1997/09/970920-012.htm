Well, I'm in big trouble now...

I painted the inside of the camshaft housing cover and ran the car for a 
while.  Then I took the cover back off and found the painted areas unscathed.  
This means the scrape marks are old ones, and the chain is fine.  This also 
means I spent over $1,000 at a shop that was trying to fix something that 
wasn't broke, and I believed their diagnosis when I shouldn't have...

I got a great opportunity to talk to the dealer's mechanics, because the 
service manager was out sick.  I snuck out back and spent a half hour talking 
to the guys who had taken my car apart (not the original shop), and found they 
had performed a lot of the tests I was planning on.  Their next best guess, 
after the OPRV, is a broken valve spring.

Am I going to be able to take the cams out of this car and get them back in 
correctly?  It sounds like a hairy, hairy job.  I also want to replace the 
head gasket, but I'm not sure this is something I should be tackling myself.
