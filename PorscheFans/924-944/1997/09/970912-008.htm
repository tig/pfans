If this is real, and it sounds just silly enough to be then I'd say it
is a marketing gimmick of the first order.  Putting a turbine blade in
the flow path of escaping gasses has to slow down the flow of those
gasses, unless the turbine is actually a powered prop (or ducted fan in
this case).  Energy is conserved, so the potential energy of the
escaping gas will be transformed to kinetic energy turning the turbine,
and the speed of the exhaust flow will decrease in some amount relative
to the speed of the blades of the fan.
Also, you have to consider that there has to be a disruption of the flow
by the various supporting structures and body of the fan itself.
Flaming and rude comments by people who have actually bought this thing
are welcom.
