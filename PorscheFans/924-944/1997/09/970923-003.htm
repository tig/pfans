Hi Fans,

The water cooled timing belt replacement technical session scheduled for 
Saturday, September 27th, has been changed to:

      Saturday, October 11th at 11:00 AM.    <== New Date

This was required due to a conflict with schedules at White-Allen and 
only one technician available to do all three cars (928, 968, & 944).

There has been some talk about putting together a video of this session, 
or more likely a photography session with a write up, but that still 
needs to be negotiated.  Even if we do, that is no excuse not to show up 
first hand and watch it first hand.  There will be refreshments and lots 
of Porsche talk going around.  White-Allen's parts department will be 
open, too.

I hope to see as many of you as possible in person.  A strong showing 
would help motivate White-Allen to do more for the Porsche community at 
large.

White-Allen has requested a head count and I would appreciate an RSVP if 
possible.  Drop ins are always welcome too.

Please call me direct if you need any information!
