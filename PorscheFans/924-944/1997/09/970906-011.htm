Being a skeptic, I have long since learned not to trust post hoc
observations, but I guess it's worth a try if it proves to be the solution
to this common problem of water leaks on the rear passenger floor.

Fix (apparently):
 In the right storage compartment in the back, a hose runs down from 
 somewhere along the right side of the car. I assume it is a drain
 hose of some kind. Anyway, this hose runs down and escapes through a hole
 at the bottom of the fuel tank. I pulled it out and positioned it near
 one of the drain holes in the storage compartment.

The car hasn't leaked water for a week now, so maybe this was the problem.
Admittedly, I haven't been driving the car for this week, so maybe the
problem was really a crack in the floor that only made water come up while
driving. I don't want to stick the hose back in to find out.. :)

Hope it helps.
