I cannot trace this one. The front oil seals and collars have all been changed 
by a local workshop. Although I checked them out and talked to the "mechanics" 
the whole episode was a catalogue of delay and excuses. This was a bad move 
and I shall not return.
The problem. Oil ,not much, is finding its way down to the bottom of the 
bracket next to the power steering pump, the one which has both the belt 
tensioner rods attached. Where is it coming from? 
The crankshaft seal also weeps a little. I saw all the new parts before they 
went in and can only assume that the workshop was less than careful when 
working on my Porsche. Although I have a guarantee on the work I am just not 
happy to let them touch the car again.

Any suggestions?

Alyn
