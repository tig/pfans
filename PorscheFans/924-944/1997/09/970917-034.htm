I have been calling around the country about chain tensioner/head breakage
problems.

The 944S,  944S2 and 928S4 all have the same cam chain tensioner and head
design.  I have heard of head breakage on all 3 models, more on the S for
some reason (maybe the age and mileage of these cars compared to the other
models) .

The bottom line of my research is that anyone with one of these cars should
replace the chain tensioner every 30,000 miles to be safe.  

They seam to break 50-90K miles.  I have heard of some failures as early as
35K miles.  The plastic part of it can get britttle from heat and age and
it can break off, jamming things up, bending valves, chipping teeth on the
cam chain sprokets and the chain tensioner mounting part of the head (the
number 2 spark plug tower area) can break off.  This happened to me on my
87 944S at 90K miles going 65 mph.

If you keep on top of the chain tensioner and cam belts, you should not
have a problem.  I here the engine in the 944S2 is great with plenty of low
end torque compared to the 944 and alot less complexity and maintenance
than the turbo.
Some tell me they have even beat some 911s in races.

Some even suggest replacing the cam chain as well ($28, but must remove
cams to replace ).  But most are of the opinion if you change the chain
tensioner they have not seen a problem with the chain or with head
breakage.
