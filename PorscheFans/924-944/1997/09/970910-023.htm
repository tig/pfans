Due to the UPS strike and them being back logged with packages, it took my Sanden
AC Compressor 1.5 weeks to get here.  I ordered it and it is a very complete kit,
unlike I had expected (I was kinda advised to check on the actuals and specifics
about the kit, after the purchase and prior to receiving it).  I was told by the
 salesman at Vertex that the kit I ordered included compressor, clutch, hose fittings,
and hardware for installing brackets only.  The kit also included hoses and belts,
what a suprise.  This kit was purchased for $289 from the October, 1997 Excellence
magazine.  The receiver/dryer for $40 and the expansion valve for another $40.  Total
price $380 and some change.  I'll start installation in a couple of weeks I'll keep
you all posted.
