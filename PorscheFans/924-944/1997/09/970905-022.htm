Hi all,
I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on the following problem that
occurred on my 1988 944S last weekend....

Car started fine and ran fine during the day on Saturday, did about 100km's
of driving (60 miles).
However, Saturday night I started to notice that the gear shifting was
getting a little hard.
It gradually got worse, so I did some tests on the way home (hoping that
I'd make it home).

When standing still and idling they seem to change OK.
If I accelerate out hard in first then I simply cannot take it OUT of first
and into second until the rev's (and speed) drop down (ie. it's stuck in
first gear). If I'm sitting at 100 km/h there is no way that she'll drop
back from 5th (or 4th) into third gear - I can pull it out of 5th or 4th
but it won't go into 3rd until I bring the speed back to around 70-75km/h.
Going from 5th to 4th isn't as easy as it should be either, but it works.
A couple of upchanges also won't go easily.
Any ideas?? I'm no mechanic when it comes to transaxles.
Appreciate all replies...
Regards, Steve. - 1988 Guards Red 944S, Australia.
