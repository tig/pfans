Hi All
I really need some help here. I am trying to locate an oil leak on the lower 
front side of the engine. I have posted before and thanks to all who 
responded, esp Dave Cooley, Marv et al and that carb cleaner smells great!
It's not the oil cooler, filter or pressure switch. The shaft seals have 
recently been done and the oil only appears after a run, clean it away and it 
stays clean until the engine is run again.

After ages with the carb cleaner and letting the engine idle while I am laying 
underneath( I was safe, provided I kept away from the belts) the oil appears 
from the lower two bolt shafts of the lower balance shaft housing, between the 
shaft cover and the casting which is attached to the power steering pump. 

Could it be that oil is breaching part of the seal of the balance shaft cover 
and running along the bolt shafts which I assume are not threaded since the 
bolts are threaded into the engine casting. I know this sounds strange but I 
am running out of options. The bolts are numbers 9 and 11 on page 64 of Haynes 
figure 9.24a although the casting for the power steering is not attached in 
the photo.

If anyone can shed some light on this I would be most grateful.

TIA

Alyn
