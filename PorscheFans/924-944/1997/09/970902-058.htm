I'm afraid my baby just did a boo-boo. It suddenly developed a "ticking" 
noise while I was cruising along at about 30mph. It matches engine RPM, and 
seems to be coming from the valve train. I verified this with my 18" 
screwdriver and ear. Sounds a lot like a collapsed lifter, but I can't 
figure out why it would happen now. The oil has about 2500 miles on it and 
still looks clean on the stick (20-50 Catrol GTX). I listened to the 
injectors, valves, etc., and it sounds like it's the #3 cyl. intake lifter 
as best  I can tell.

I would appreciate any help you'll might have in troubleshooting or repair 
suggestions. My experience with Detroit iron says this shouldn't happen 
unless the oil got REAL dirty, so I don't want to dive in prematurely. Can 
you use the same treatments, i.e. deisel fuel, Miracle Oil, etc. on the 944 
like you can on a 350, or will it kill the seals, etc.?

Engine is 85/2 944 with 102k miles, NA. Belts and rollers replaced 1800 
miles ago, and I re-tensioned them at 200 and 1500 miles. Oil cooler seals 
replaced ~2500 miles ago after I got about a quart of coolant dumped in the 
pan. I caught that one almost intantaneously (luckily) and haven't had any 
problems as a result. I replaced the oil about 100 miles after I replaced 
the seals to prevent nasties from occuring.

TIA
