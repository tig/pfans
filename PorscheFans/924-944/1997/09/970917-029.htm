George, et. al.,

Patient: 1989 951, 108K miles.
Victim: Owner of said vehicle.
Vitals: Guarded, undergoing corrective treatment for excessive fluid 
lysing.
Current Symptoms: Rear main seal regurgitation.

Patient history:

After replacing the clutch and rear main seal this last Spring (the old 
one didn't leak, but I thought it would be good measure to do so anyway), 
and now my oil pan gasket as of last weekend, the car continues to drool 
oil from the bottom of the opening between the engine block and clutch 
bell housing, directly below the rear main seal.

I have both cleaned the area behind the flywheel with spray carb cleaner 
and raised the rear of the car so that it is level (now on all four jack 
stands) to no avail.  Still the oil continues to drool out the rear 
behind the center of the flywheel.  This is a bit of a mystery as the car 
has had the oil drained out of it for about two weeks as the oil pan and 
oil cooler/filter housing gaskets are being replaced.

I have performed a 360 degree inspection around the bell housing where it 
connects to the engine block.  Everything is clean, especially behind the 
rear of the valve cover on the head.  The only oily area is that which 
surrounds the oil fill tube.  Still there is no visible oil at the seam 
between the bell housing and the engine block.  I have checked the seam 
between the oil pan and the engine block for traces of oil that may 
migrate at the seam, but it is now squeaky clean (amazing what the carb 
cleaner does).

Pending your reply with a further suggestion as to where else oil might 
be gravitating from, I plan to pull the transaxle, torque tube, bell 
housing, clutch, and flywheel to visibly inspect the area for leaks this 
weekend.  Since I can find no path for oil to migrate into the bell 
housing, and since oil is coming out of the bell housing, I can only 
assume that the leak lies inside the bell housing.  If you can rule out 
all other possibilities, then what remains, no matter how absurd, must be 
the answer.  Would everyone agree?  Is there anything that I am missing?  
Has anyone noticed if the Oil Fairy is hanging near Dayton, Ohio these 
last few weeks?
