Sorry guys... I'm just a little confused now.  At first it was - Lock on
stud with red dot, placed closest to valve stem.  Then someone wrote that
the valve stem should be placed opposite.  Can someone set it straight.
Where should the lock be placed, where relative to this should the valve
be, and where should the crest point (even if it is just for looks!) ?

Also, is there some kind of rubber sleeve available to be fitted within the
Porsche lug wrench?  Is there a good alternative?  When I did my brakes,
the lug wrench chewed up my nice black anodized lug nuts.

Gee, Andrew, I'm feeling bad for you that I asked the question about cracki=
ng 'S

heads last week. Sometimes synchronicity sucks...


Perhaps this is the cracking the two mechanics I talked to were referring t=
o. I wonder if this is something that German Precision or another machinist=
 could fix? BTW, Andrew, for my mental database, could you provide particul=
ars on your car? Mileage, use, etc.
