I've recently replaced the tires on my 85.5 944.  The tires that were on it
prior were Dunlop D40's.  After reading a raving write up in European Car about
the Nitto tire brand, as well as having a friend rave about his, I decided to
buy a set of the Nitto's.  My observations are that the D40's may have had
slightly (very slightly) better stickiness on dry concrete, but exhibited more
rollover when diving into a corner.  The Nitto's are hands down MUCH MUCH better

in the rain than the D40's were.  The D40's used to light up easily coming out
of my favorite corners on damp concrete, whereas the Nitto's in a downpour only
spin if I snap the clutch and then they hook up very quickly (I'm in
Orlando...rains every afternoon this time of year).  When pushed too far, they
slide predictably, and hook up when I take my heavy foot of the pedal.  I'm
happy with
the Nitto's for street use.  Oh, and a set of four onlycost me $465 installed.
:)

Richard, that saying about firestones still has me laughing.  I heard the same
thing, though not said nearly as well  :)
