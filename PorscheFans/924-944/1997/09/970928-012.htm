P-Fans,

I recently bought an 83 944 black, and have come up with some questions
about the car.  

First, I have a question to all the people who have made a family car
out of the 944.  How do you reply when your significant other mentions
that "You seem to care more about that car than me!"  

Second, When I fill up, I usually get alot of gasoline vapors inside the
car.  I checked under the car, but there doesn't seem to be any leaks,
so I am a little perplexed.

Is the antenna on the 944 supposed to be power???  Call me vain, but I
think pictures look nicer when the antenna is down, and I can't get mine
to go down.  Has anyone ever replaced one.

Finally, what is the normal oil pressure of a normally aspirated 944. I
think mine is high, but a friend said that is just the way the car is.  

Thanks is advance, 

Collin W. Dykstra
