Just received what I thought was the paper version of my parts 
microfiche, but was both surprised and confused at what I got.

The dealer delivers this box, somewhat heavy, that upon further 
inspection had a four ring binder inside (about the same size as the 
workshop manual binders).

Inside, neatly broken into 10 categories is a three dimensional drawing 
of every part in my car with those neat little assembly witness lines.  
Each part is numbered with an illustration number, but no part numbers.  
The top of each page has the same numbers that are on the fiche; I would 
imagine that they correlate with the fiche.

I am considering compiling my own list part numbers, but the 
illustrations are worth their weight in gold to me.

Anyone interested should contact their dealer.  The book I got was for 
all models of the 944 family from 1989 through 1991.  The part number is 
WET 614 900 and cost me $38.00.  I am sure other model years are 
available as well.

Back on the list, it seems...
