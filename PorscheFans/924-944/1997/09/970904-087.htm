All,

I had the manifolds welded today.  Well, only the inside one was cracked.  It
had a 2 inch long crack that was 1/8 inch thick at the widest point.  Nice,
huh?  Removal was actually pretty simple, thanks to the "double nut the studs
and remove them first" pointer from 951Fireball (thanks Jim!).  With the
studs out, the inside manifold comes straight out with no interference.  The
outside manifold (also with the studs out) came out by letting it drop some,
then rotating it clockwise through the fuel lines (which you'll have to
disconnect from the fuel rail of course).  I had a floor jack uder the oil
pan on some boards and raised the engine slightly.  Didn't look like it moved
more than a cm or so.  

Now I'm searching for the best method of insulating them so I can put it back
together.
