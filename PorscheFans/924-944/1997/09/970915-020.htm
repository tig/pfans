Hello gang,

     I put the nose bra and mirror bras on my 951 and decided to take a trip.  The
220 mile trip was a delight in this superbly engineered automobile.  After slowing
down and bring the car to idle at a restaurant, I noticed the car was idling erratically.
 I raised the hood on the car and noticed a vaccum leak was coming from the idle
screw (I guess that's what you call it).  "What happened to the *#*@~ screw?" was
my first response.  Next, I was trying to figure if I had been sucking dirt into
my engine for the last 2 1/2 hours.  The restaurant was located next to an AUTOZONE
parts store and I bought a package of assorted vacuum caps for $2.31.  After installation,
the idle immediately returned to normal.  Is this a common problem?  Will this vaccum
cap cause problems later? How important is that disappearing screw?



Thanks for your help.
