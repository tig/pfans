Thanks to Menelaos for his email to replace the sunroof gears.

Now I have the new sunroof lift arm gears ready to go in - trouble was =
that the drive cable had totally unwound from both gearboxes but I have =
fed it back into both gearboxes.

On the sunroof motor there this "pipe" in which there is a worm drive=20
cable.  Where it fits into the drive motor assembly there is a black =
sleeve at the end of the cable.  Does anyone know if this has to slide =
all the way over to fit flush with the motor assembly, covering a =
polished funnel, or is there a 1 inch funnel visible in which the drive =
cable moves?

In the roof, the cable feeds through the fist gearbox and onto the right =
hand one,  and on for about 1.5 inches more.  IS that enough?

When I put the lift arms back in should I use the motor to lower the =
arms then put back the sunroof? I guess this is the only way.  I really =
hope the limiter relays are not too far out of alignment - can they be =
adjusted?

Sorry if this is confusing or really boring - dealer tells me they often =
go so guess it may happen to many of us.

Thanks - Peter  - peterh@cdi.co.uk  (944 1989)
