My car does the exact same thing.  I don't know if it's normal or not.
I asked about this on the list and didn't got a response.  However, I 
saw a post from a fellow on the 928 list whose car had the 'whoosh', 
and his mechanic found a "valve which vents the gas tank" installed 
backwards.  Fixing this valve apparently made the 'whoosh' go away.  

I bought the 944 equivalent of this valve (I think) and am eventually 
planning to install it to see if the whoosh goes away.  I located a
one-way valve in the 944 design, apparently between the gas tank and 
the charcoal canister, located near the fuel filler apparatus.  It is
supposed to be accessible from a cover inside the rear cargo area.
I'll let you know how it goes, when I get time to do the job.
