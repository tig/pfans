Just finished the extreme, ultra PITA of 951 alternator R&R - I could 
almost hear the masochistic Engineers in Stuttgart laughing when 
I started into one of several tirades of obscenities in my driveway
(Why do I have to remove the entire turbo air piping system to get
to the alternator?  Why are most of the bolts so hard to reach?
Why is that stupid cowl so large?  Do they really need 15 bolts to 
hold the front section of the splash shield on? Etc.).
But, the whole deal only set me back $29 - this included new bearings
(pressing them on and off was almost as enjoyable as the actual
R&R process) and brushes, which tested my soldering skills
(hold iron, regulator/brush assembly, and pliers all at once to 
pull the old brushes out after the solder melts).  Brushes were
only $3 - guy at the import auto electric place (they rebuild
alternators also) was waffling on whether or not to sell me the 
brushes only (wanted to sell a whole rebuilt alternator for $150), 
but he finally caved in, revealing the secret true frugality of alternator
rebuilding.
Problem started with a ringing, whining sound (alt. fan ringing due to
a bearing on its way out) and ended with a definite abnormal whirring
sound at idle.  Bearings did not feel rough or loose when spun by hand,
but new ones did the trick towards elimination of the noise.

Not as cheap as the $1 starter rebuild awhile back, but nevertheless gives
a good feeling to overcome another portion of the mechanical obstacle
course known as Model 951.
