The tires I have on a 93 968 are the Firestone Firehawk SZ50.  215/45/17 =
front and 255/40/17 rear.  Since I track the car and have dedicated =
track tires & wheels for that purpose I wanted an inexpensive high =
performance tire that had extraordinary wet performance and were =
reasonably quiet.  These tires are all that and some.  I have tried the =
Dunlop D40M2, Michelin XGT-Z4, Bridgestone Potenza RE71 and Goodyear =
GS-C models at one time or another.  The Firestones beat them all in =
every aspect.  Even did a couple of track laps on them and was =
pleasantly surprised at how well the did.  They are also almost the =
cheapest high performance tire available.  Check them out.  You won't be =
disappointed.
