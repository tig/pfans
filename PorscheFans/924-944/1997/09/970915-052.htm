He is correct.  I found this out as well when I wanted to put
them on my 1988 944.  Porsche changed the wheel offset in 1987
from 23.3mm to 53.?.  There is no Fuch available for 1987 and
on 944's.

After aquiring a 1986 Turbo with 16" BBS wheels I immediately
began the search for a set of Fuchs for it.  Only did I find
the 1986 std 944 and 1986 Turbo offsets were different as well!

After a 3 month long search for 16" Fuchs for a 1986 944 Turbo,
I resorted to buying brand new Factory 16" Fuchs for the car.
Yeah I spent some $$$, but now have the car back to it's factory
look with new Toyo Proxie T-1 tires.  The car looks very nice.

As for the 1988 944 I have, it still has the factory 15" Phone
dials, although any 87-9? 944 will fit on it.  I've also been
told several later model 911 wheels will fit as they have the
53.3cm offset.

You might look at buying 911 C2 style wheels for it .....
