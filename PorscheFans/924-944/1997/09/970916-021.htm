Think I asked this before, but I never got a reply, so here it is again. 
(Got a '79 924.)

I couldn't start my car after I finished rebuilding the engine a couple of
weeks ago, so I had it towed to a local mechanic who claimed he could fix
the problem fast.  (He couldn't.)  He told me he could only start the car
with carb spray in the intake manifold 'cause the fuel distributor was
broken.  I ignored him and promptly started the car, thereafter driving it
home.

But I think he was right.  The car exhibits all the classic faulty fuel
pump symptoms - difficult hot start, occasional erratic idle, stumbling on
acceleration - but I've had the fuel pump replaced a couple of times and
the problem hasn't even slowed up.  How do I check/fix the fuel
distributor?  Haynes talks about taking out the fuel pressure piston, but
I've heard some bad things about that, and from what I know of CIS,
they're all true.  Do I have to go with a rebuilt/new unit ($)?  Could the
problem lie elsewhere?  Do I have to bite the bullet and get a Porsche
mechanic to take a look at this?

Thanks.
