Anthony,
        Unfortunately, I do have some experience with this. Right before the 
UPS strike, I had new tires put on my Fuchs, wouldn't you know it, they 
incorrectly mounted the 225/50-15's on the 7x15 rims, and the 205/50-15's on 
the 8x15 rims, and scored grooves around the periphery of the rims. I showed 
the damage to the manager, and after some discussion, he agreed to have the 
damage fixed. I did a bit of research, had a local shop give me an estimate on 
repairing the damage (~$550), but decided to have a place that specializes in 
Porsche wheel repair (Rennsport) do the work. Of course the tire shop deals 
with UPS only, so they insisted on waiting until the strike was over. I think 
every other person in the US sending their wheels to Rennsport must have done 
the same because I have had the car on Jack stands for the last three weeks. I 
should be receiving the wheels back today (shipped last Tuesday). I will let 
you know how it all pans out. Make that tire shop that damaged your wheels pay 
for the damage! It certainly is a struggle to get quality work done. Make sure 
the next place you have tires mounted at uses a contact-less tire changing 
machine (they are expensive ~$10,000).  I am going to the dealer, ~$80 to 
mount and balance 4 tires, ouch..

Good Luck,
  Ezra

Subject: Damaged wheels

Last week I put on some new rubber on my C2 rims. I have absolutely babied
these rims and in about 1 solid year of driving, have yet to put a single
scratch on them. I wash them reguarly and wax them.

Problem is now that I have my car back I notice that the clear coat on the
polished outer lips are "bubbled" and "chipping" presumably from where the
techs mounted the tires.

I did warn the tech that if he couldn't mount the tires without scratching
the rims not to bother. Anyone had similar dealings.

I know shops hate working on cars like ours cause many on us are extremely
picky, but if you take "exceptional care of your car" shouldnt you expect
the same from those working on them. 

I don't know much about mounting tires is it possible to mount them
without causing damage?

Last question, since the lips are polished could I remove the
cracking clear coat and put a good coat of wax on them. I have a friend
who had a set of 16" phone dials completely polished without clearcoat and
they still look great. 

Sorry for the lengthy post.

A.
