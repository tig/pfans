|Hello All,
|I remember someone asking a while back about the additional chassis
|stiffening that was added to the front end of the '88 Turbo S and '89 =
Turbo,
|but I don't recall seeing a response.  Tonight, while playing around in =
the
|engine compartment (mine's an '88 951 S), I noticed a bolt-in cross =
member
|between the motor and the radiator, connecting the front "frame rails." =
 At
|first glance, it looks like just another piece of cooling system =
plumbing.
| On closer inspection, it appears to be a piece of bent steel tubing =
which
|serves to BOTH connect the radiator to the overflow tank AND to brace =
the
|front of the chassis.
|Welded in a sort of a "Y" at each end is a short elbow of tubing which =
turns
|down and bolts into the top of each rail via a fairly substantial =
looking
|mounting plate (WAY too hefty to simply be a support for the tube =
itself).
| Through the other "arm" of the Y and the main part of the tube flows
|coolant!=20
|Can someone tell me if I'm seeing this right, and if this constitutes =
the
|additional "S"
|chassis bracing (or do all the Turbos have it)?

All turbos have that tubing.

There is no additional chassis stiffening for the TurboS models...


Good Luck!
