I'm assuming if an alignment was done, front end and steering components
were 
checked and pronounced ok......I'm also assuming that the tires were spin 
balanced which should have revealed a bent rim....I've had several occasions=
 
where tires would exhibit out of  balance symptoms after being spin balanced=
 
off the car.  We'd balance them on the car and solve the problem. Sometimes 
the problem is in the way the tire is warn, especially on wide tires.  If it=
 
were driven out of balance it would wear unevenly, then with a rebalance the=
 
unevenly worn surface would cause out of balance characteristics.  Shave 
balancing on the car cures this as long as there's enough tread on the 
tire.......

it is 95% of the time more than a balance problem. if your tires wont
balance on the machine than doing it on the car wont make much difference.
usually it has to do with a bent or bad steering component, i.e. tie rod
control arm and the like and probably 50% of the time it is a bent rim.
