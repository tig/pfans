My car came with "Linen" interior, but the PO replaced the carpet with
black carpet (trunk is still linen). I think it looks great and although
I made him deduct a little from the selling price due to non-orignal
carpet, I catually like this better. It is also a lot less sensitive to
dirt.

Just my 0.02,

	I am in a rather nasty situation, I have an 86 Burgandy 944 with
that "Light Grey II" interior, which looks bloody beige to me, but since
this is an original Arizona car the carpet has taken a real beating from
the sun, and it needs replacing.  OEM carpet will run me about 1250 but
I
can get get 3rd party carpet, but wouldn't you know it, not in my color.

	Has anyone replaced their "gray/beige" carpet with a black set??
and if so how do it look???

			Thanks in advance.
