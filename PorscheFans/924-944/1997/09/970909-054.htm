This seems to be a common problem for us 951 owners. Because I don't 
track my car I usually don't find myself traveling at that speed...but I 
have on occasion, and on occasion I suffer the same symptoms, although 
intermittently. I was e-mailed by one Pfan who said he had a small split 
in the left intercooler to turbo pipe, and I believe it was Dana Kincaid 
who remove his air flow sensor to give it a once over, after 
reassembling solved his problem. (Correct me if I'm wrong here Dana.) 
Others suggest a new DME is in order, and I recall one NA944 that cured 
a similar problem with a DME swap. 

My mechanic seems to think I have no vacuum leaks, and could give no 
insight as to the problem. He simply changed the fuel filter, and sent 
me on my merry way. I get the impression he unsuccessfully chased down a 
similar problem once before, and did not want to lose the same battle 
twice.

I would be curious to find out what happened in Jim Richmond's case. 
Jim? Is that incredible beast of yours back on the track, and if so did 
you ever resolve your cut out problem? Did you ever purchase that new 
(used) brain?
