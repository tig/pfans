The stuff you were told about S2's is bullshit!
Get it checked out by another mechanic.

I'm now with PorscheFans for about 1.5(?) years now and never
read something like that. I myself drive an S2 for about
3 months now and i am *absolutely* satisfied with this car.
I not only drive it every day to work over the Autobahn,
which means an average speed of 200-240km/h ~ 124-149 mph
(if there's not too much traffic) - i also use this car at
slalom events. This is a great car and worth every Pfennig
i paid for it.

So if your car has all records, go for it!
