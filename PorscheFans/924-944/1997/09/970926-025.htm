Subject: 88 951 Option Code C43?
To: 924-944@PorscheFans.com

Anybody know what this is?

Also, option 474 Sports Shock Absorbers.  Are these std Turbo items?  In 
the FAQ, they have an asterisk indicating std turbo items, yet none of the 
other std turbo items (spoiler, 16" wheels, etc are on my option sticker).

And 437/438 Full Power Seats w/ 946 Part leather Seats Frt.  Are these 
the generically called "sports seats"?  They do have a sticker on them 
which says  "Porsche by Recaro" or something like that as I remember.

Dear Greg
    The 474 option for the 951's consist of Koni Sport Shocks instead of the
standard valve - Sach Shocks. I believe both suspensions use the same springs
(up front) and torsion bars (rear) and A-Arms. There was also a M030 Club
Sport Package that consisted of lager brakes (both Dia & thickness, frt & rr)
heavy duty Alloy A-arms, lower ride height & stiffer springs & torsion bars. 
    Regarding Factory Sport Seats: The factory order code is #383 sport seat
- left, or #387 sport seat - right, or #989 left & right sports seats
w/cloth.  the Sport Seats can be Identified by a large botton & seat back
bolsters very simular to the old Recaro "KRS" seats. The bolsters are about
four inches deep on the bootom and seat back side wings, once you plant your
bottom - your aren't going any where! 
    And last but not least, regarding your head lights winking at you. First
check your headlight linkage, often the 8mm bolts, they have 10mm socket size
bolt heads work them selfves loose, make sure the linkage is not kinked &
lube properly. Also there is a headlight motor relay that could be starting
to go bad, it is located in the main fuse box, under the hood. 
 
                      Good Luck, Dave Jalali
