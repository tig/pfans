I'm having my rear hatchback glass replaced, and I was wondering what
exactly I'm getting for roughly $2400, or should I say what my insurance
company is getting for $2400?  Has anyone ever had their glass on the
hatchback replaced?  There's a leak along the part that I can only refer to
as "upper hatch trim" and I want to make sure that it's replaced as well. 
I've been to 2 glass shops, and a local Porsche dealer, and they all say
the whole thing has got to be replaced.

Can anyone tell me exactly what's going to be replaced?  The glass shop
that's going to do it (a shop recommended by the dealer) isn't sure, and
the dealer isn't really sure, because there has been so many superceedes on
the part(s).  

Thank God for zero deductable full glass coverage!

Thanks,
Jeff
