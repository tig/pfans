The PO installed 225/245 tires on my NA.. But I wonder if it was more for 
appearance than function, since my machine doesn't have the M030 option 
or any other fancy suspension mods.  I prefer the wide look, however.

They seem to do fine in the rain, but that is a function of the tire 
brand you buy.  Note that the tires have very large rain channels to move 
water out.  It is my understanding that street tires have the same ratio 
of rain channels to rubber contacting the road, so large tires shouldn't 
impose a traction penalty in the rain.  This is important to me, as I 
live in Oregon (West coast, US) where it rains 9 months out of the year, 
and I enjoy my car year 'round.

However, I could be wrong.  If so, flame away.  ;-)

 -Gregor  944 2.7.
