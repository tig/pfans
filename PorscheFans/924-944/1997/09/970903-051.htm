P-Fans,

I'm in the process of upgrading the suspension on my '89 S2 (no sports
option package) and thought that S2 owners might find some it useful. 
First, my apologizes for advertising my Koni struts for sale, but I think I
can keep them and still do the upgrades. Also, thanks to Jason Burkett,
Steve Timmins, Doug Donsbach. Barry Lenoble and George B. for advice and
listening to my frustrations.

As S2 owners know, the struts for this model have smaller 4.5 inch perches,
so nearly all aftermarket springs, which are 5 inch diameter, won't fit.  I
bought some Turbo Cup series progressive springs (150-410 lbs/in) at
Jason's (Paragon) suggestion because the narrow end fits nicely on the
lower perch.  To take care of the top end of the spring (about 5 inch
diameter), get a 5 inch diameter strut hat for one of the other 944 models.
Fits perfectly. If you want a linear 5 inch diameter spring - well - let me
know how you deal with the lower perch.  One solution would be to drill out
a 5 inch diameter strut hat and slid it down the strut, but it's strength
might not be up to the task of supporting the front end of the car. And I
don't know if an enlarged lower perch would rub against brake calipers,
etc.

Had the Turbo Cup springs on for a while and they felt good. Comfortable
ride but improved handling. Since I haven't got the rear suspension
stiffened yet, I wasn't about to really push the car thru corners. In fact
there was so much understeer that the front tires chirped on curves. All I
can say at this point is that the Turbo Cup springs made the front end feel
like it was riding on R1s instead of street tires.  

The problems with the Turbo Cup springs is (1) at full strut extension,
they're short enough to rotate and maybe jump the perches, and (2) they
drop the ride height 1 and 3/8 inches.  The height is OK for street
driving. Minimal scraping on driveways, etc. But it drops the car enough so
that the front control arms are angled slightly upwards towards the
outside. I've heard that this places undue stress on the front suspension
and should be avoided (any opinions here?) So I've ordered spacers
(Weltmeister?) to raise the height again. This spacer is for models that
are already low in ride height prior to aftermarket spring installment. 
I'm assured that this will fit nicely on top of the springs.  Would like to
lower the car more, but don't see a way around the suspension geometry
problems except changing tire size (suggestions?).

The remainder of the plan is to go with 29 mm torsion bars to balance the
handling.  Hope I haven't dialed in too much oversteer.  Jason recommended
30 mm bars with Turbo Cup springs for autocross, while Powerhaus
recommended 28 mm w/out LSD and 29 mm w/ LSD for time trials.  Have time
trials at Pikes Peak in a couple of weeks, which will be a good place to
test the new suspension. Lots of run-off room.

Anyway -- bottom line -- so far, so good -- we S2 owners with the weird
strut perches have a few options w/out sending more $$$ on struts designed
for other 944 models.  And there's a lack of consensus about which other
struts will bolt on to the S2.  Also know a local machinist who offered to
make a sleeve to adjust ride height if I need it.  

Comments appreciated. I'm kind of commited to this upgrade path at this
point, but would like to make further improvements.  Next year a Quaife. 
Guess I could save money buying a prepped track car, but I trust mine and
don't want to inherit additional hassles.

-- Nick
