Not hard. You will need new inner and outer bearings and races and a new
seal. The only unexpected tools you will need a sharp chisel to tap the
bearing cap off and a brass drift to tap the old races out and the new
ones in.

Procedure is like this:

Use the sharp chisel and a hammer to tap around the outside of the bearing
cap. Angle the chisel toward the rotor and work slowly and you won't scar
anything.

Remove caliper and hang from wire attached to strut.

Remove two phillips screws and pull the rotor off.

Loosen hex in clamp nut and remove nut. Remove outer bearing and
washer.

Pull hub off spindle.

Remove seal from back of hub. Can be tapped out from the front of the
hub with the brass drift. Remove inner bearing from hub.

Clean grease from hub.

Put hub in an pre-heated 250 degree F oven for 30 minutes. You can
certainly do this job without heating the hub for removal or installation
of the races but I've tried both ways and heating it makes the job go
faster.

Wearing golves, use the brass drift and a hammer to work around the back of
each race to tap the race out. Work slowly and don't scrape the inside of
the hub with the drift. If you use something harder than brass you will
gouge the hub and make a big mess of the whole job. 

Clean the hub where the races were. Use a little brake cleaner on a rag to
keep from cooling the hub down. A little wipe of WD40 around the inside of
the hub will help the new races go in more easily.

Tap in the new races using the brass drift and a hammer. Work slowly around
the circumference to avoid cocking the race in the hub. After it gets in a
little it will go fast. Again, try not to abuse the inside of the hub with 
the drift.

Lube bearings, races and spindle per the Haynes book and install the inner
bearing.

Tap the seal in with a block of wood to seat it flush with the back of the
hub.

Reinstall the hub on the spindle. Insert outer bearing, washer and finger
tighten the clamp nut.

Reinstall rotor, tighten to torque spec'ed in Haynes.

Adjust bearing nut for tightness per the Haynes book. Resist the temptation
to over-tighten the bearing nut. The thing gets tighter when it heats up.

Tap bearing cap on. Don't dent it.

Reinstall caliper, tighten to torque spec'ed in Haynes.

Test Drive.
