These are quartz-discharge headlamps (as fitted to new Porsches, and
some Mercedes, Lincoln, and BMW, among others). They are easily
distinguished by their distinct blue tinge (as opposed to the yellow tinge
of halogens and incandescents. From what I understand by reading a
trade magazine (about the Lincoln), the system consists of more than
just a headlamp unit: there's some special components in there including
some kind of special power supply like a transformer - I think the lights
work on AC, don't know what voltage or frequency (as opposed to the
DC put out by our batteries and alternators). What this boils down to is
that you'd have to find one of these cars in a junkyard and buy the
components off of it (very expensive, I'm sure), and then re-engineer
them into your car. That still doesn't address the issue of the lens, which
are custom designed for each car (BMW, due to the round headlight
shape, would probably be the best bet for a transplant).

I think it would be simpler to just get projector-type driving lights with the
prismatic lenses. Of course, then you may run the danger of being
mistaken for a Rice-Boy! (I'd personally like to have a set of these, when I
can afford them, due to poorly-lit country roads...)
