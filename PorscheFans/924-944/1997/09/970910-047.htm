Thanks to Dave Cooley, Stu, David Bahain, bcn, and Don Istook for their
replies.

As it turns out there were several problems.  

The story goes like this.  The shop tried replacing the DME relay, still
nothing.  They tested the ignition switch, as I suggested, and found
that terminal 15, which apparently supplies the DME relay, was not
energized. After they replaced the ignition switch, still nothing, so
they tried a new relay again.  This time the fuel pump started cranking
and the injection system pressurized, but still no spark.  They popped
the distributor cap and found a cracked rotor.  After replacing the
rotor and cap, the car started.  The O2 sensor was dead, so I had them
replace it, too.  While they were at it I had them tension the belts for
good measure.
