<<I have had several suggestions to set my front camber at about -2
degrees for
autocrossing to avoid cording the outside edge of my Hoosier autocross
tires.>>

I'd recommend at least that much - even more if the car isn't driven
that much on the street.

<< Since this car (92 968 coupe) is my daily driver, I have a few
questions:

1.  What are the normal camber settings at the front for a 968?>>

Doesn't matter at all. <g> The fact that you have Hoosier autocrossers
means you are now a select breed of individual who expects their tires
to last less than half an autocross season or 2000 miles (whichever
comes first). You might want to use the street tires from your cabrio or
get another set of wheels if you drive much.

<<2.  What would be the effect on normal driving and wear on my new
street
times from going to -2 degrees?>>

With negative camber, you are going to be wearing only the inside edge
going in a straight line. This also means that you won't have as much
adhesion while accelerating or braking. It also means that you will eat
up the inside edge if you mainly go in a straight line. About now you
are thinking question #3:

<<3.  In other words, is this a good idea overall?>>

If you want maximum mileage and stopping power on your street tires, no.
If you want maximum grip when negotiating around pylons and you want
even wear on the Hoosiers when they are being used for what they were
intended, absolutely YES!. All race cars on radial tires have outrageous
amounts of camber. Take a close look at a headon photo of an F1 or
Indycar going through a turn. The outside tires are oriented straight up
and down for maximum contact patch while the inside tires are canted in
at a huge angle. 

You also have to change the camber in the rear but not quite as much.
I'd recommend as much *balanced* camber that you car can manage in the
front which should work out to 2.5 - 3 degrees, and about a degree less
in the rear. If you want to compromise for more street usage, I'd
recommend 2.25 front and 1.50 rear as a starting point. The absolute
minimum would be 2 front and 1.25 rear.

The actual amount your car needs with a particular set of tires can only
be determined on the track with a pyrometer. You may be able to get the
tires hot enough on a long autocross course to determine the tire temps,
but I doubt it. This is all covered quite elegantly in Fred Puhn's book
"How to Make Your Car Handle" (ISBN 0-912656-46-8).

You will also be able to tell by the wear pattern if you have
sufficient/insufficient camber and/or tire pressure. If the tires wear
out in the middle, your pressure is too high. If the tires wear out on
both inner and outer edges and you still have tread in the middle, you
have insufficient pressure. If the tires wear on the outside edge first,
you have insufficient camber, or your car is understeering (fronts) or
oversteering(rears), or you are overdriving. If your tires wear out on
the inside edge, you either have too much camber or you are driving it
too much on the street.

Also, keep in mind that you have picked a tire that has really soft
rubber and is really thin - as far as I know the thinnest DOT-legal tire
manufactured. That is good news for grip and heat dissapation, but it is
really bad news when it comes to debris found on the street. If you want
a better compromise street/autox/track tire, you might want to consider
the Kuhmos or even the BFG R1s when your Hoosiers wear out a few months
from now. I run the BFG R1s and their street performance is tolerable. I
got 8 track days, 2 autocrosses and a dozen or so 100-mile trips from
full tread depth R1s. If I drove my car more than occasionally on the
weekends and I didn't want to get another set of wheels, I'd go with the
Kuhmos.
