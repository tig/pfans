In July this year, right after I bought the car the shop recorded these 
values:
#1	170
#2	175
#3	165
#4	170

Two months later, same shop
#1	150
#2	145
#3	145
#4	120

The car has been running EXACTLY the same the whole time.  Chevron 
Super w/ Techron gas 90% of the time.  Second test was also after 
tuneup.

I don't know much about leakdown tests but he said that the leakdown 
was "very slow" so shop suspected carbon buildup and dumped some fuel 
system cleaner in it.  But I remember some posting regarding see a low 
compression value on the #4 cylinder and that there was some reason for 
it.  Anybody remember this post or know the answer?

p.s. I assume leakdown test would show ring wear vs. compression 
showing rings and valves.
