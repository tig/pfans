Two things for the list today: I've been thinking about performance
improvements for the early 924 that I have, on the intake side of
things, especially about that 944 revised profile throttle cam, and I
came up with one neat little trick I thought I'd pass on to the list.

The 944 revised throttle cam works by opening the throttle more quickly
than stock, for a noticeable (apparent) performance gain, due to better
pedal response. I was thinking about applying this to the twin-choke
throttle on my wife's '77 924, and came up with the following:

By inserting an 8-32 x .50 screw (with corresponding nut, or M4 x 10mm
for you metric freaks) in the end of the slot where the primary throttle
cam picks up the secondary throttle cam, the range of motion is reduced,
meaning that the secondary throttle is opened earlier in the pedal's
range of motion. Therefore, you end up with better apparent throttle
response, just like the 944 throttle cam. I tried this out, and the
effect _was_ noticeable (and welcome; the car's an automatic!).
Furthermore, this costs only pennies for the nut and bolt! Try it out,
see what you think!

Keep in mind, this only applies to the K-Jetronic cars, which have no
Throttle Position Sensor (I'm guessing you'd have to adjust or re-map
this). Also, you're not really gaining any horsies, just getting to your
top-end more quickly. Personally, I like it, especially for passing on
the highway.  Anyone out there see any potential problems with this
(aside from the ability to decrease your mileage if used
indiscriminately)?

On another note, does anyone know a decent, inexpensive welder in either
the Rockville, MD or Leesburg, VA area? I have a little welding I need
done on the car, simple stuff like door hinges, no really excellent work
needed, just repair, and I can't afford to spend much money on it
(having just moved).

TIA...
