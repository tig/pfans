Being as I am new to the list and am sure that this subject has been
discussed at length before I found the list, I will apologise in advance
for what is probably a stale question.
I am plagued by a shimmy in my 86 944.  At 60 mph, the steering wheel
starts ocillating at about 8/sec and the magnitude of the ocillations then
maxes at about 75 and slowly tapers off after.  I think it is coming from
the front as I feel it more in the wheel than the seat.  I have had the car
to the dealer who balanced the wheels and did a full alignment with no
improvement.  I have taken it to the tire store locally and rebalanced X2
with no improvement.  The rebalances were in both planes, he said, after I
explained the wide wheel thing to him and he understood.  This is a very
vexing and annoying problem and I would be grateful for any advice.  TIA,
jgieske
