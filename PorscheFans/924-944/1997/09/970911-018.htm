Dana,

My '95.5 944 has 118K miles and my '89 Integra just turned over 110K miles 
this week.  Frankly, the Integra has held up much better than my 944.  
Admittedly, I bought the 944 used and the Integra new, but the Integra is 
still in excellent condition while the 944 has more things wrong with it 
than I can list.  The Integra (never rustproofed) is admittedly beginning 
to show some rust behind the rear wheels (after 8 Michigan winters).  The 
944 never (well, almost never) sees snow, and has no rust, but the paint is 
cracked in several places.  Mechanically, the 944 has had more replaced 
than I care to remember, while the Integra, except for an appetite for rear 
brake calipers, has been virtually flawless.  As for the interior, the 
Integra looks new (for better or worse), while the 944 is looking rather 
worn...

My wife and I have owned 2 Acuras ('87 and '89 Integras), 4 Hondas ('80 
Civic, '85 CRX Si, '86 Accord, '91 Accord) and 3 Porsches ('79 924, '87 and 
'85.5 944s).  Based on my experience, I fully expect at 200K miles that 
BOTH my 944 and my Integra will still be going strong.

Don't get me wrong... I love my 944, and hope to park a 928 next to it 
soon.  But my Integra is also a fine car, and I hope to park an NSX next to 
it some day (but the 928 first).
