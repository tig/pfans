The 3M part numbers for the products to remove and replace stoneguards are as
follows:

Product     Part #
3M Woodgrain and Stripe Remover  08097
3M Woodgrain and Stripe Adhesive Remover 08908
3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner  08984

I have used the Woodgrain products with success.  Someone else I know did not
have success.  The product states that it is for Vinyl products which the
stoneguards are not.   3M GPAC has worked on all adhesives I have encountered.

The 3M Scotchcal Paint Protection Film is the product that I have used to
replace my stoneguards with.  Many other people have made clear urethane bra's
out of the material (this material also comes cut to the appropriate dimensions
for the most popular vehicles) with great success.  I haven't since rock chips
on my front end do not bother me since the car could easily be repainted when
it gets to that point.

There are various part numbers for this product.  I am going to assume that
nobody will need 36 yards of the material.

Part #  Size  Thickness

84911  11.5"X75"   8 mil

To apply, clean the surface with a good degreaser/cleaner.  Spray the area
where the Scotchcal Film is going to be applied with an isopropanol (rubbing
alcohol)/water mixture (I think it is a 15% solution but the directions would
tell).  This provides slip so that the film can be moved around for awhile to
get it into the right spot.  Squeegee out the water/IPA and let dry.

Saw notes regarding bonding the interior vinyl to the roof and the associated
problems of doing so.  What you are experiencing (the vinyl falls down after
awhile) is the plasticizer
in the vinyl bleeding into the adhesive causing bond failure.  Pick an adhesive
that is resistant to plasticizer bleed thru.  Try 3M Vinyl Trim Adhesive, part
# 08064.  I haven't used this product myself but know that this is what it is
used for.
