My '88 924S has had noisy lifters since I got it (about 15K ago).  I switched
to Mobil 1 thinking it might help, and it did nothing.  However, I am happy
to report that there have been no additional oil leakage or consumption
issues in the 6000 miles that I have been using it.  In fact, the engine has
about 100K on it, and still uses no measurable oil in the 3000 miles between
changes.  As for the noise - I've decided to live with it, as it has no
bearing on performance, and gets much quieter after the fan has come on a
couple times.
