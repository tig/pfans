     Guys,
     
     Does anyone know anything about the Air Con system on a 951. The 
     problem is there is no pressure differential between the high and low 
     presure sides. The Technician says the part that is faulty is probably 
     the Venturi and this is under the dash. Does anyone know where under 
     the dash this part is ? Other thought was that the Compressor needed 
     replacing ? (Mega bucks, or at least it would be here in the UK).
     
     I'm assuming that I can't just take it off as the system would need 
     depresurizing first. Would I be better off saving my penies and 
     letting the 'profesionals' do it ? Or is it something I can sort 
     myself ?
     
     Any help members of the list can give would be much apreciated.
     
     Other thing and please don't flame me for this:
     
     Any PFans in Southern England (UK) who want a good garage to take 
     their vehicle to try:
     
     Camtune on 01483 421911 ask for Mike Gleeson. They are extremely 
     helpfull and knowledgeable and don't mind if you wander around their 
     workshops.
