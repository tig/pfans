        Leaving out repairs lets a lot slip between the cracks. My P-car
buddies are less concerned with the predictable costs (insurance, gas,
purchase price) than they are with the sometimes unpredictable raids on the
checkbook for repairs. Perhaps we should include annualized repair costs
for those who have owned their P-cars for several years, to average out the
highs and lows.
        I purchased my '83 about a year ago and put about $4500 in repairs
into it to get it mechanically excellent (being a perfectionist sometimes
sucks). This should have kept it humming along for a couple years had I not
had a tragic run-in with a sport utility vehicle...
