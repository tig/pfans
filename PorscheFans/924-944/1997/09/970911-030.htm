Wow. It just never quits. Any other info about this car, Ted. Was the body 
stiffened elsewhere, adding stress to the floor of the car. And how hard do 
you drive? 
 
 
This is a track car that had 120,000 plus miles on the body when built 2
years 
ago.  The body is stock except for a roll bar.  The suspension is modified 
with all rubber bushings replaced with harder material or steel so there is 
probably more vibration throughout the tub than in a street car. It gets 
driven very hard and is always a top 2-3 finisher.  I don't think it's
abused 
though and we've seen similar fatigue in street cars.  This is not a big
deal 
to fix and reinforce though and certainly much less troublesome than the
rust 
in an early 911 floor and tubes.
