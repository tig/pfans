hey dave,

    Sorry, ....it took a hit in the front.. I managed to run into a
two-hundred year old, abandoned barn....( who say's I can't hit the broad
side of a barn?).allthought the body metal back to the winshield is totaled
on both sides, the softness of the 200 year old wood absorbed enough of the
impact that the vast majority of the under hood mechanichs has remained
intact, even a recently rebuilt head with about 3,000 mile's on it
$.$..$...$.... I think I'm starting to tear up again!!!!!!
    The car is alpine white and was in exceptional condition at the time of
the accident.
     The interior is aslo still in great shape and is burgundy in color.
      keep in touch to let me know if there is any part(s) in which you may
be interested.
