Hi P-Fans,

I have just this morning put tires on my wife's S2.  Because of the wear
patterns on the previous D40M2's, I wanted to get a four wheel alignment as
well.  After mounting and balancing, the technician got the car set up on
the alignment rack and found every spec to be out, both front and rear.
This car is a 1990 without the M030 (?) suspension option.  The alignment
machine is an optical unit (Hunter).  The specs before and after are below:

 Before    After               Before   After 
        LF                            RF      (Readings in deg.)
  0.36      0.07    Camber      -0.94   0.06  
  2.31      2.31    Caster       2.29   2.29
  0.34      0.08     Toe         0.60   0.10

        LR                            RR
 -0.44     -0.99    Camber      -0.44  -0.45       
  0.56      0.40     Toe         0.72   0.75
                          
The fronts adjusted easily to desired specs.  The rears are not the least
bit in spec -- camber should be -1.33 to -0.67 and toe should be 0.00 to
0.33 by their alignment machine's settings.  There were three bolts
including the lone eccentric adjuster on each corner.  There appeared to be
the rear most adjuster missing, but the photo on the alignment computer
display showed no adjuster either.  In short, exactly like on the car.  The
technician got it as close as possible and welcomed me to return, at no
cost, with more information so he could complete the job.  

So P-Fans, the reals questions are: 1) How does one adjust toe on the rear
suspension?   2) Does it take a special tool to adjust toe using that
vacant, rearmost adjuster hole, or am I missing an adjuster on each side?
and 3) Are there any tips/tricks that could be utilized to bring this into spec?

TIA,

-Bill
