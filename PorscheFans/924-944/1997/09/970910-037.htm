This is of course completely true. I do not suggest that changing the
7.5A for a 10A will make the car electrically unsafe. 
               
A 1.5 sq mm cable (14/16 gauge) will safely carry 10 A or more. The
penalty for a 'thin' wire is a voltage drop, more as higher the current.
This may not be a problem in transient load consumers like stereos but
may be of concern for halogen lamps.
  
Halogen lamps depend on proper voltage to shine brightly, like all lamps
do, and a voltage drop of 10 percent will lessen the output with about
one third. They also need proper voltage to recirculate the filament
properly. That means that there will be no black residue on the inside
of the bulb, and the bulb will stay clear until it ultimately breaks.
This is a very desireable side effect, as that makes lamps usable for
much longer. At low voltage, they will blacken, just like oldfashioned
ones.            

I think it is worth pointing out that voltage drop may be a function of
connectors and ground points too, and not only wire size/lenght. There
may be no more needed to make lamps shine brightly than to check, clean,
'WD40' and tighten connectors and ground wire screws. If problems like
that are present, no bulb will do itself justice, let alone a extra
powerful one.   

A good volt meter can be used to check on voltage drop, but you have to
have the lamp on, otherwise it will not tell. You may be pleasantly
surprised what can be easily and cheaply achieved, just by making sure
the connectors are in good order.

May the force be with you...  and when you polish the lamp, the
Halo-genie comes out and may make things even brighter...
