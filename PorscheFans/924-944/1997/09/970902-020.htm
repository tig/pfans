Howdy dudes,

I'm back from Germany and I'm 100% recharged!  Today, the film will be 
developed for the 12 rolls and I'll create a web site with the best pictures.
To make a super long story short, here's a summary of the good things:

- 212km/h was the fastest the rented BMW 318 would go, it would hit the
  rev limiter in 5th at that speed.
- the longest time we were able to drive 200km/h continuously was about
  15 minutes, but we stayed above 180 for a longer time.
- going 200km/h on the speed limitless areas of the Autobahn is about the
  most you'll want to go in the daylight hours.  This seems to be the
  standard speed that most people drive.  Only two cars ever came up my
  back when I was going 200-210km/h and had to move over for, once an
  E420 and the other time a 7 series BMW.
- when driving 200km/h, it's not uncommon to be driving 5ft behing the front
  guys bumper and 5ft from behind.  People seem to like the tow as it's
  cheaper on gas.  In Germany, this is perfectly safe, no one does anything
  stupid on the highway.
- the country back road to the Nurburgring is the most amazing stretch of
  twisty roads I have ever driven.  The BMW really, really impressed me.
- the Ring Taxi at the Nurburgring was amazing, really something else.
- karting at Hockenheim and the 'ring were awesome.
- taking a ride in the Ruf CTR was something outside of this world and the
  hospitality at Ruf was stunning.  We got a private tour by Alois and Estonia
  and then the ride in the new CTR.
- food and gas are expensive in Germany and especially in Switzerland.
- Princess Diana's death was taken quite hard by the people in Switzerland.

If you have questions about Germany, fire away.  This was definitely the
vacation of a lifetime.  I'm already planning on shipping my car down next
year!

Farzaan.
