Greg,
     That is exactly why I don't let anyone do any work on my vehicles unless 
I really really can't do the work myself. I have had nothing but bad luck with 
having work done by other people. In fact I have had disasters with every 
single thing I have had some one else do on my 944:

State inspection - They screwed up the Sekuriflex coating even though I warned 
them about it, the low IQ owner of the business wouldn't cover the cost or 
labour to remove the gooey sticker mess from the windshield. Fortunately with 
a couple of hours of my time, I returned the windshield to new condition.

Tire change - Scored marks around the periphery of the rims, fortunately the 
manager at this place had some ethics and is paying to have the rims 
re-finished at rennsport, but this has left me without a vehicle for 2 weeks 
in prime summer months.

4 Wheel Alignment at the local porsche dealer - They decided to reduce the 
negative camber on the rear wheels to reduce tire wear for around town 
driving. Well, I don't drive like that, and am now having to replace the rear 
tires, no word yet if they will at least return the alignment to factory specs.

  I wouldn't even venture to guess what a disaster it would be to have the 
work done at a "professional" installer. I worked at such a place for 3 weeks 
when in college, and quickly left to return to ckt. design as the ethics in 
these car stereo shops has much to desire. For example, when a customer would 
come in with a simple problem that would take about 5 minutes to fix, a high 
fee was charged ($20->$30), and the vehicle would sit in the back lot for a 
while to make the owner feel like they were getting their money's worth since 
they had to sit in the waiting room for so long. In addition, most if not all 
shops are on a commission basis, so the more jobs the installers do, the more 
they make. This does not favor quality work!

 I have replaced the rear speakers by removing the quarter window glass and 
interior trim, and did not think it was all that difficult. I used a piece of 
Plexiglas with rounded edges to aid in prying up the rubber seal on the 
windows. If you need more detailed instructions, let me know.
