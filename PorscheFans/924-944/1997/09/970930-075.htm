About 3 seasons ago a friend and I built an '86 951 for Drivers Ed and F 
class Club Racing. We knew there would often be 2 drivers so I put an 
additional oil cooler in series with the OEM cooler to prevent what I 
suspected would be hot oil conditions. It has always worked well so I 
put one on my 83 944 that I have autocrossed and tracked since bought 
new. This summer I decided to so some testing. On the Turbo, I measured 
the oil temp between the OEM cooler and the engine after it had been 
through the OEM cooler.  On an 82F day it was returning 257F oil to the 
engine in OEM configuration.  With my cooler in line it was 202F. I 
don't know what the oil temp was coming out of the engine but the OEM 
cooler probably dropped it 20-30F at least.  On the 944, the oil goes 
through the water/oil heat exchanger before it goes to the filter. Using 
a sandwich plate, I got a temp without the cooler on an 87F day of 261F 
returning to the engine. With the cooler it was 226F and the car ran 1/4 
mark cooler on the H20 guage. I didn't have as much airflow on the 944 
but I can get more.
	Do these temps jive with anyone who has done similar testing?  
Most 911 people would panic at these temps. Can water cars tolerate 
higher oil temps?  Let me know if you want more info.
