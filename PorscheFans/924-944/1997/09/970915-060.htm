Okay, new day, new questions.

	On the driver's side of my car, the brake calipers are blue.  One 
the right hand side, they are black.  Also, (I haven't pulled the wheels 
myself) what appear to be the brake hubs are matching colors with blue 
left and black right.  What's the deal here? 

	One more about colors.  I have phone dial wheels but the alloy 
lug nuts look like they were originally black.  The lock covers are 
definitely black.  Is this normal or were they replaced at some point?

	Looking at the 225/50s I have mounted on the front 16x7, they 
look like they could rub on the front fender lip.  They haven't yet as the 
fenders are still clean.  If I ever upgrade the suspension in this car, is this 
something I need to worry about.  Most of the spring packages that I have 
seen state that they lower the car by x inches.  These descriptions have 
not included mention of a spacer to retain stock height.  Any info for me 
while I browse the catalogs?  These tires also look a little "bulgy" for 
these 7" rims compared to the 245/45 mounted on the rear 18".  Is there a 
spec (rim width) for the Dunlop SP8000.  Also, is it possible to put 16x8J 
phone dials on the front (like the back?)

	Last note, based on input from this group, I decided to check 
back with the local tire shop before getting a 4 wheel alignment there. 
When I asked him about the tool for rear toe and talked to him, his advice 
was to take it to the dealer or a specialist.  Nice to deal with honest guys.  
This is actually the second guy who has referred me to a specialist.  I 
asked a local shop if they could charge my a/c.  He looked around the car 
for a couple of minutes and said since he didn't even know for sure where 
the low side inlet was, he'd feel better not doing it.  Then again, I guess 
these guys don't get paid commission.
