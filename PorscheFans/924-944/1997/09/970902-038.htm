I know that my 1987 944S had this, so it may simply be something that was 
added on the 1985 1/2 and later models.  As to why...

Well, here is a short list of items I found on my 944S which I definitely
liked and I miss:
1)  Three speed wipers.
2)  Retained power to power windows even with the key out of the ignition.
3)  Air conditioned glove box.
4)  Door seals that are on the the outside of the door sills, not the
inside (keeping the sills clean).
Are these features one could live without?  Yes, since most cars are
simply not designed to this level.  Are they desirable?  To me, yes.  When
I bought my 944S, I expected to meet a "hot rod".  Soon I found out that
the car was much more than that, definitely the all-around nicest car I
have ever been in (comparison includes 911 and 964 variants). 

And yes, I was able to keep my chocolate, tiramisu and tapes cool in
the glove compartment when I was taking my trips to Kentucky with the sun
beating down on the black dashboard. 

From an engineering standpoint, the ducts are right there, it did not cost
much more to add this feature.
