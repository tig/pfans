The $650 price is with new glass.  As far as I know, no body panels or 
glass is "prorated".  That is, devalued with age.

I know many, if not all, states in the U.S. owner of a damaged vehicle to 
insist on new OEM parts at no financial penalty.  Insurance companies 
have made some progress with assuming that this will be the case.  I have 
seen instances where "deals" have been offered to use used fenders, etc., 
with repairs.  Insurer beware is the rule here.  I believe these "deals" 
are not as much corporate policy as some crafty adjuster's, or collision 
shop's attempt to maximize profits.

With an old beater this may make sense.  Most people do not even get them 
fixed, but with higher end cars it is in the best interest of all 
involved to see the repair is done right.  This does not exclude the 
possibility of bad judgment, but as a trend sheet metal work has been 
given better attention with the use of OEM materials.

For my policy with State Farm, comprehensive damage to glass does not 
follow the above rule.  State Farm has partnerships with various national 
auto glass repair services that offer substantial savings to State Farm 
for the exclusive business State Farm offers.  I would also think that 
this allows those service shops volume discounts on glass and materials 
as witnessed by the difference in price between dealer and the glass shop 
costs fro the windshield.

If the replacement glass is really the same as OEM at a far cheaper 
price, then this is truly a win-win situation as the insured gets quality 
glass, State Farm gets substantial savings, and our rates stay down.

I will keep you posted.
