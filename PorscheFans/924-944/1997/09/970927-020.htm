Dear Mark
    I think what you are experiencing is detonation. If the DME detects
detonation, the DME will limit boost to 1.3bar on the dash gauge. If you turn
the engine off, then restart the DME will re-set to full boost untill
detonation is detected again. What ocatne are you using? How much boost are
you running? Max boost level should be 2.0 bar on the gauge(with chips, 1.7
w/o chips) .
    You might also check the CO Test pipe, located on the pass side firewall
area. Mine blew apart last winter on a cold morning while waxing it real good
(read: High boost levels), when I shifted I heard a blam! Then the rushing
air sound when ever I got on boost. Iterestinly enough, I could still attain
full boost - it just took awhile longer to attain full boost! That stainless
steel line is $145 so I simply removed the pipe and installed a nut cap to
seal the exhaust leak. I used a metric end nut adaptor Porsche Part
#928-110-475-01.   

						Good Luck

Subject:Help! Very sick '89 951

My Turbo seems to be sick.  Yesterday on the way to work I thought that I 
felt the car stumble as I reached the normal shift point in each gear. 
Since I was close to work I made a mental note to check it out later. 
Well yesterday afternoon and today the car would not get past 1.4 BAR on 
the gauge.  As soon as I got 1.4 BAR there is what sounds like a loud 
sucking noise from the left side of the engine compartment, the car looses 
power, and the exhaust is much darker but not thick black.

To complicate things I put the Autothority version 2.7 chips in a month or 
so ago with the boost bolt.  About that same time I started to hear a hiss 
that I thought originated from the passenger floorboard but since the car 
reached 2 BAR on the gauge with no ill effects I figured it was not the KLR 
vacuum line that was leaking.  So, this morning I stuck my head in the 
passenger floorboard with the car running and the hiss is coming from 
within the duct assembly in the middle of the car behind the dash.  Because 
the hiss has been there for some time and during that time the car ran 
fine, I don't think the two are connected.  However I still have a 
dysfunctional Turbo!  I also thought that the loud sucking noise could be 
the fuel being shut off but the more I futz with stuff and listen the less 
I think that is a possibility.  I did use the LED tool referenced in the 
Turbo supplement and got no flash codes so the DME must not see a problem. 
I have experienced the cutout caused by a vacuum leak at the KLR in the 
past and this is definitely not it.

Thanks in Advance!!!!
