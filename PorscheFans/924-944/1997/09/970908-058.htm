Greetings,
	With minimal cursing, I have reached the flywheel.  I will tackle the
bolts tomorrow.  The Tranny is the backyard, clean.  While it is removed
from the car, I am replacing the flange seals and the input shaft seal.  I
am also replacing the release lever bearings and the ring gear, since mine
is chewed.  Flywheel needs resurfacing.  Rubber center on clutch disc
destroyed.

Observations:
Of 9 pressure plate (internal socket) bolts:
1 stripped (easily drilled out with a air drill and a good bit)
3 almost stripped
5 came out with no damage
	There is just, and I mean just enough room to remove the tranny.  The
Haynes manual makes it sound easy, but I really had to pry
(carefully)between the central tube and the trans. bell housing to get the
input shaft out of the coupler.  Loosing the second coupler bolt as stated
in the manual, made it more difficult.

The manual also mentions inserting a bolt into the release lever shaft and
prying it out with a screwdriver. Yeah, maybe if it was four feet long to
provide the leverage you need.  I was able to spin and then draw it out
with the impact gun on the bolt.

Not mentioned in Haynes manual - The coolant hose from the block to the
heater valve needs to be removed from the outlet pipe and drawn upward so
the two hoses on the bottom don't interfere with the removal of the clutch
bell housing.
