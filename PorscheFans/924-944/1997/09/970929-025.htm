I just did this in my '83.  I think that the only wiring I had to do was to
extend a ground wire which is no big deal.  The only problem is that there was
a metal bracket behind the right hand opening which made it impossible to
connect up the speedometer cable there.  Easiest thing is to place the
speedometer in the left opening and the warning gauges in the right.  You may
also have to find some slack in the speedometer cable elsewhere in the car to
make the reach.

Gauges push out from behind.  No screws or anything, just push hard.  Removing
the steering wheel is a major help.  Hardest part is unscrewing and screwing
the speedometer cable while the gauges is in.  Most of the other wires and
lights can be disconnected after the gauge is pushed out.

Since the tach was out I decided to rotate it so that redline was straight
up(911 trick).  E-mail me directly if you need any more help.  I'll be at
Summit Point in October with RTR so if you're there, stop by.
