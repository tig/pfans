Hello all,

As the proud owner of a '84 944, purchased three years ago, I'd first
like to thank everyone for all the information available on this list.

1) My car suffers from various idle problems. (Idles at ~770 rpms, drops
down to 500 or so on releasing the throttle, bounces back up.) I've been
told it's my idle air stabilizer valve. My Haynes book and all the parts
catalogs I've looked into refer only to an Auxilliary Air Valve. Same
thing? Is this the device under the intake manifold? How do I replace
it? Do I necessarily need to take the manifold off, and if not, what's
the next best way to get it out? It's also been suggested that my oxygen
sensor may be bad.

2) The interior is trashed. I'm interested primarily in replacing the
dashboard. Other than the obvious cosmetics and controls, do any major
mechanical components need to come out? (Heater core, A/C parts, etc)
Any tips anyone might offer? How much of a PITA is this project?

3) Does anyone have any of the early 944 brown/tan interior components
that they'd like to sell? I need seats (front and rear), carpet
(particularly the trunk mat, and the rear carpet that covers the trunk
sidewalls), a dash, trim pieces covering the windshield pillars, and the
header piece the sunvisors are attached to. 

And regarding ownership costs:
	1) Santa Barbara, CA
	2) 1984 944, purchased three years ago, $5,000 US
	3) 91 octane, $1.83/gal name brand.
	4) Not sure of the insurance
	5) Labor, $55/hr. Shop work so far has been a water pump/timing/seals
job and a clutch/main seal. I took care of the radiator, fuel pump, and
little bits.

Thanks everyone for your help... If you've got stuff to sell please
e-mail directly, aroman@gte.net.

Alex Roman.
