Hi, fellow water-pumper fans.
        I recently purchased an '89 951 to replace a non-turbo, 1983 944.
While the new beast is quite exhilerating to drive (and the post-85 1/2 A/C
is definitely an improvement in a tropical climate), I have a question
about low-end performance.
        My 1983, with lower gearing, had more around-town tractability, and
much of my driving is in mixed-city traffic. The Turbo seems to have a
tendency to wallow if I am inattentive with my shifting, and want to be
driven at higher rpms to keep its response sprightly. I also read in
Excellence that it is imperitive to drive the car in a low enough gear
(they say rpm > 1500, which is AWFULLY low) that oil pressure is kept high
for the turbocharger and other parts.
        One porsheophile suggested chipping the car to improve its
performance at the low RPM range. Is this a good idea? What would be the
pros/cons of this move?

Thanks,
Khal Spencer
'89 951
