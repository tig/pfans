Estonia had a soft spot for us and ended up grabbing the keys from Alois and
took us for a 200km/h blast down the back country roads after the three who
were lucky had already gone.  Add to it the farm vehicles and slow moving 
chicanes and it was a new experience.  Check the web site for in-car shots.

The Ruf CTR accelerates harder in 4th gear at 4000rpm than my car does 
in 1st gear at 4500rpm.  Imagine that.

Farzaan.
