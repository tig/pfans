Subject: Stranded without a clue?

Hi Folks,

This is a follow-up to my recent 'Chug-a-Lug' posting.

Firstly, thank you to those who responded. As you recall, at the time my 
car was stalling in 2-3 gear(s) at any time, at any speed. The symptoms 
were similar to when you first learn to drive stick and you get your first 
Red/Green light (remember... the embarrassing lunging and chugging ?). A 
complete stall... the car would turn right off... similar to flooding.

Anyway, I took it in to a local Porsche Dealership and Mechanic(s). They 
could not diagnose the problem, but did change the oil, check the rotor 
caps, changed the spark plugs, and installed a new fuel filter. Happy, and 
a little poorer, I left hoping the problem was fixed. It isn't!

If anyone can offer suggestions, I would be eternally grateful.

X-tra info: when I turn the ignition, all electrical systems - good; I 
checked the fuses - all good; but, if I turn the key to just before the 
starter kicks in and then turn it off and listen, I hear a click-click-c  
lick (pause) click-click (stop). I think that this may be the throttle chip 
(?).

Could this also be the fuel pump?

Thanks,

Dear Jonathan

    I would check you fuel pressure regulator, located on the fuel rail,
toward the rear of the engine compartment. When this regulator fails it cuase
some wierd running problems! Pull off the vacumm line to the valve - sniff it
for leaking fuel, if so replace the regulator. Also, if it has been on the
car for awhile I would replace it any way, they go bad all the time, $80 for
the part.  When my unit went bad, my engine would run rough, sputtering and
running mega rich at times, lots of black smoke out the tail pipe! Then it
would be ok for a while! When the reg would act up the fuel pump would make
strange whirring noises becuase the reg would restrict the fuel returning to
the fuel tank inturn starving the fuel pump bearings (the fuel pump uses
exsess fuel to cool it) and hence the noises!  When this regulator fails it
will either leak fuel onto your hot engine! Or fail internally and keep the
fuel rail pressure sky high the engine will start up, run for a second then
flood out! If you pull off - one fuel injector connector, the engine will
start up and run fine abeit only on three cylinders! 

                     Good Luck, Dave Jalali
