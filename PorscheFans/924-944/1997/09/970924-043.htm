I track my 968 hard and I have not had any brake cooling problems.  The =
only time I experienced significant fade was at Road America where after =
about 6 hard laps the brakes showed fade in Canada Corner.  (Not a good =
place!)  I use the Ford High Performance brake fluid as it has a higher =
dry boiling point than the ATE super blue and since its clear, it's easy =
to see if the fluid has become dirty or if there are bubbles in the =
line(s).  The Ford fluid is also less than half the price of the ATE so  =
it's cheap to change the fluid before every event.  Probably not =
necessary, but makes me feel good.

If you have the M030 sport suspension you already have the big front =
rotors and calipers.  If not you're still fine.  The brakes on this car =
are great.  Have fun!

Subject:	any 968 brake preparation recommendations for time trial?

I plan to time trial my 968 for the first time in late October.  I =
already
plan to install new high temp brake fluid, and brake pads designed for =
track
use.

What other modifications are needed to insure the front rotors survive =
the
heat?  Will the standard 968 brake ducts be sufficient, or are Cool =
Brakes
really needed?  I would prefer to skip the the Cool Brake kit and
installation cost.  However, if other's experience is either the kit or =
new
rotors afterwards, I'll opt for the kit.

The only experience I have is with a 951 which definitely needs the Cool
Brake kit.  The 968 has more standard brake ducting than does the 951, =
and
more engine braking due to the higher compression.

Any sharing of actual experience from other 968 owners will be greatly
appreciated!!

Gary
