Ok, here's my newest problem.  I start my 85.5 944 in the morning and if I don't
put my foot on the gas it spits and sputters and shakes for about 10 seconds
then runs ok.  If I give it gas immediately, it revs then settles fine.  Other
things that may be related.  Sometimes, after pushing in the clutch to stop from
any speed, the revs slowly drop to about 2K rpm then stay there.  It should and
sometimes does, drop quickly to about a 1K and idle nicely.  When it idles high,
blipping the throttle and cursing doesn't work, it just stays up there and then
some time later it will just drop quickly to 1K rpm and stays there.  I've
tapped on the idle controller when it's running high with no effect (checking if
controller is sticking), but if  I tap on the top of the idle cam nut, sometimes
it fixes it.  Question:  Would the idle switch cause this condition?  When the
car is off it clicks just as the throttle cam is turned, and adjusting it looser
has no effect on the problem.  Also, when turning the A/C button on and off the
idle drops by several hundred if it's on.  Doesn't the idle controller
compensate for A/C pull and shouldn't the idle remain unchanged?  If so, that
would point to a idle controller problem right?   Could this also cause the
run-on that I've been complaining about and won't go away?  Would more syllable
curse words or a BFH (Big F****in Hammer) do the trick?

I'd appreciate some input as I'm sure one of the 900+ of us has seen this
before.  Next chapter we'll talk about that smoke I saw yesterday morning when I
started it up.  :(  Oh, I do NOT want to think about that one.  Sounds like head
work to me.
