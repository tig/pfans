 This procedure is fairly easy and it took me about 2 hours. I however
 had the luxury of being familiar with circuit  boards. HANDLE WITH CARE.

But that's only one part of the installation with the Welt. chip package, as
I understand it.  I believe there's also a wastegate shim which needs to be
installed, and I recall reading posts that made it sound like a PITA.  Can
someone who's done it advise?   I have the Autothority Stage II, which
includes two chips and a revised boost bolt, which is easy to install.
