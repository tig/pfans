>The starter in my '89 951 makes awful sounds when it cranks.  A mechanic=

(who specializes in Porsches) told me that since it does the job, I
shouldn't worry about the horrible sound.  He told me that it could be
another 30,000 miles before the starter dies.  Can anyone shed some
light on this.

Also, I'm getting pretty fed-up with the noise, and am thinking about
replacing the starter myself (so I can stop cringing each time I start
the car).  How big a job is this (for a novice)? Is it as easy as Haynes
says?

Maybe 30,000 miles if you never turn the engine off again.  Find another
mechanic, preferably one who is not smoking shop rags.
