     Hi all, this is my first posting so if I'm not following any 
     written/unwritten norms please forgive. I've got an '87 944. I just 
     had it serviced (split fires, fuel filter, cap, rotor, wires were 
     fine, timing belt tensioner rod) but it still acts up during the first 
     start of the day. It turns over a few times then roars (perhaps I 
     should save "roars" until after I install a chip?) to life and then 
     promptly acts like it's choking on something and begins to die. I 
     usually just give it some gass and that's the end of it. Perhaps 
     there's a blockage in my fuel line? I've had the car since January and 
     have not had any major repairs done. I also use everything Prolong 
     makes to keep my baby happy. Maybe she just wants some of my starbucks 
     and this is her way of pouting? Thanks for any help.  TAJ, aka, Mahal
     
     P.S. My father just purchased an '85 911 this weekend. I heard it was 
     rare because of the factory installed "special" tail, red exterior w/ 
     red interior, no sun roof, 65,000 miles, '94 rims. She's definitely a 
     sweet kitten. I was just wondering how rare this car might actually 
     be. It was set up for concourse racing (by a dealership here in 
     Seattle) but has never made it to any track. Thanks again!
