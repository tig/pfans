I think I may be able to help on the stoneguard removal and high prices of the
stoneguards.  I have been flamed for being employed by 3M and mentioning 3M
products that would solve many of the problems on the list.  I have kept quiet
on a number of issues but will try once again on this subject.  If it is uncool
to do so, I will stop.  I do not make money in any form off of these
suggestions, just trying to be helpful.

There exists two product that make the job of stonguard removal a breeze.  A
product that is called 3M Woodgrain Remover and 3M Woodgrain Adhesive Remover
do the job in no time.  The first product is not to be used on lacquer paints
(older Porsches may have lacquer paints - to check, spray the product in the
spare tire well area and watch what happens.  If the paint starts to lift or
crack, do not use it on the stoneguards).  Follow the directions on the can and
the job is easy.  I have done this on my car and experienced no problems.

Another product that can be used to avoid the high cost of the stoneguards is
to purchase a kit 3M makes for most make of vehicles (no Porsches) to replace
Bra's.  It is a clear urethane (same material used to make the stoneguards but
UV stable) that comes in roll form.  You can then make your own stoneguards by
tracing the stoneguards on the car onto the rolled urethane.  On roll will do
quite a few stoneguards.  This product also works great in place of the bra's.
It is clear, can't see it on the cars and is removed much easier than the
stoneguards on the car.

If anyone is interested in these products, I can put part numbers and such on
the list.  If any of this is a problem, let me know and I will stop.
