Kevin,

I do have good oil pressure in the car, the gauge reads over 5 bar.  I
had this double-checked with a mechanical gauge to be sure.  I did
replace the oil pressure reducing valve last week, and it did no good. 
I have checked the j-tube and it is clear (at least I can blow through
it with little resistance), and the banjo bolts are fine.  I will have
to get new sealing rings now, but I have used new ones during tests in
the past.

I have it torn apart again, and took the tensioner apart to see how it
works.  Is it supposed to be a "dead end" in the oil supply line, or
does it have a controlled release somehow/somewhere?

Next steps:

1.  Paint the inside of the cam cover to run it again and check for
scraping to be sure it's not OLD scrapes.
2.  Somehow pressurize the tensioner and check it for leaks.
3.  ?

Allen
