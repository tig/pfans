wastegate shim is a bear to install - take my word for it.  Might want to
consider the Autothority upgrade if you're not inclined to disassembing
your wastegate.  Most people don't automatically assume they will be
*under* their car to do a chip upgrade.  Automotion doesn't reveal this
little tidbit in their catalog - just multi-color torque/HP curves.

*don't* tell you that get 'ya.  I'll never forget being in my unheated
garage in February trying to remove the @#&! wastegate.  On the bright
side, I have plenty of 3/8" drive ratchet extensions and universal joints now.

This is not exactly a reply to your post, but I'll pick your brain anyway.

Do you get a full 1 bar of boost (2.0 on the guage) from the Weltmeister
set-up?

Thanks,

Mike
