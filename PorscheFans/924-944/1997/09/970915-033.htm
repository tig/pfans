PFans,

FYI. FWIW. More on suspension upgrades on the S2.

Finally got my S2 suspension back together.  The Turbo Cup springs fit
perfectly on the S2 Koni struts if you get the 5 inch dia hat and add the 1
inch spacer made for the 951s. Added bonus is that you don't need a spring
compressor to install due to the short spring length. Just crank down on
the top nut. Spring fits snugly, so no chance of the spring jumping perches
at full strut extension.  Ride height drops 3/8 inch, not enough to get the
front control arms angled up.

Had a 29mm torsion bar installed in the back. Porsche mechanic who
installed it thought the ride was too stiff for a daily driver. I found it
just fine, but might be more desensitized to stiff suspensions than some.

My first chance to try this out was the Pikes Peak Speedway - a road course
using part of the banked oval.  Not exactly your standard Driver's Ed
course - 2 nice hairpins, some silly chicanes, part of the front straight
and then a HUGE drop (felt like driving off a 2 story buidling) down the
bank into a long, VERY fast constant radius corner into the back straight.
I was worried about having dialed in oversteer, and this sweeper was not
the place I wanted to test it.

I did start to spin out on a hairpin in the first practice session.  The
back end will come around more readily if you over-throttle on an exit. 
But after getting a sense of the suspension, it felt great.  Kept a good
contact patch. Less drifting on exits, and more tire screaming and holding.
 Now I have to relearn the limits. Thought the 29mm torsion bar might be
too much, but - at this point - I think I can recommend the combination.

If someone can tell me the secret to keeping the throttle to the floor on
long constant radius sweepers, I'd be obliged. All 944 drivers (including
some experienced ones) were lifting, while the better 911 drivers buried
it.  Must be a different sensation in the two cars.

A question. My oil pressure dropping a tad below the "4" mark on some of
the runs, even in the morning when ambient temp was down. Has anyone
installed a second external oil cooler on a 944?
