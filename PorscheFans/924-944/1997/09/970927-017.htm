Dear Tom
       I think you discovered your own problem. The black - rubber intake
boot that you're reffering to: is probalbly causing a vacum leak. If this
boot has a crack or leaks air the engine will not run smoothly or might not
run at all!  I would fix this boot first and recheck to see if the engine
still cuts off.  This boot sit beside the turbo housing and is expossed to
alot of heat. It is pretty common for it to crack/leak. Cost about $120, last
time I checked. 
     If you still have a condition where the engine cuts off while driving, I
would check two things first. The DME relay could be starting to go bad -
simply replace it or use a friends relay from his/or her car to test. Or
possibly a bad inductive pick-up sensor. The inductive sensor either works or
it doesn't. Porsche uses two senors located on the back of the engine/fire
wall, above/on top of the bell housing. One is for the DME Computer, the
other is a RPM sensor for the tach. Simply switch the wire connectors and see
if this makes any change in performance/engine power loss?  Good Luck.
                                                                       David
Jalali
