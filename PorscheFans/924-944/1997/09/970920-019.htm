HI!

        Need some advice. I am about to purchase a 944 to drive steadily
through the four hottest months here in Florida. 944's down here seem to be
going for very reasonable prices in the AutoTrader. I am considering
anything after 1985.5 and am also looking at Turbo's and S and S2's. My
mechanic was pretty vocal about avoiding Turbos due to all the extra
plumbing and what he seems to feel is higher maintenance. My regular ride is
a 1987 911 Targa and I like the power. I did drive a 1987 NA which had a
chip and was tweeked quite a bit and it seemed pretty peppy but I have also
tried some NA's that were pretty sluggish. Most of the cars available are
pretty high mileage. Any problem here if the car seems well maintained.
Could someone comment on this please?

        What should I look out for if I try a Turbo? I have read the FAQ but
would like some more input if possible. I've been following the S2
reliability thread with interest. My wrench seems to think they're a pretty
good car and would prefer to see me in one of them than a Turbo. Of course
there is a purchase price premium.

        Almost every car that I have seen has a cracked dash. Is there any
point in replacing them? How much expense is involved?

TIA
David Greenberg
