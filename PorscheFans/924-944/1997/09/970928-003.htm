 Hmmm, there seems to be a lot of disinformation in this note...

The two sensors both feed info to the DME, a failure in either one will =
keep the engine from running
at all. They do have an intermittent failure mode, which will cause =
intermittent running problems.

The DME relay can be bypassed with the appropriate jumpers.

For more accurate information, read the 944 FAQ...

|Dear Roxanne
|
|    First a couple of questions. Does the engine ever run long enough =
to
|fully warm up? If so when you are driving along - in any gear and the =
engine
|looses power do you notice if the tach jumps to zero while you are in =
gear
|and the engine is loseing power? If so it could be something on the =
primary
|ignition side of things. Does the engine crank over after it shuts off, =
but
|will not catch? do you smell or notice any black smoke from the tail =
pipe?
|Any repairs done recently just before you started having this problem?
| Please send me/or the list more information.=20
| =20
|   When you replace the rotor inside of the distributor cap, did you =
use blue
|Loctite on the set screw? The screw holds the rotor at TDC, the shaft =
has no
|slot to index the rotor. Maybe the rotor is simply spinning on the =
shaft?=20
|   Have you check/replaced the DME relay, It is cheap($40) and should =
be
|replace if it is original. When the relay fails the engine will loose =
both
|spark and fuel power - and as far as I know there is no way to use a =
jumper
|wire to bypass like a fuel pump relay. Any 944 DME relay will work of
|diagnoses purposes.=20
|   If you still have a condition where the engine cuts off while =
driving, I
|would check two things first. The DME relay could be starting to go bad =
-
|simply replace it or use a friends relay from his/or her car to test. =
Or
|possibly a bad inductive pick-up sensor. The inductive sensor either =
works or
|it doesn't. Porsche uses two senors located on the back of the =
engine/fire
|wall, above/on top of the bell housing. One is for the DME Computer, =
the
|other is a RPM sensor for the tach. Simply switch the wire connectors =
and see
|if this makes any change in performance/engine power loss?  Good Luck.
|                                                                       =

Has
