Hi gang:

The beautiful phonedials on my '86 951 have all the counterweights
mounted on the outside of the wheel (not the edge between the wheel and
the tire, but rather the ~3" flat surface before that -- what's that
area called anyways?).  I thought it was odd when I first saw it, and
several ppl have commented on it as well; e.g., that they thought these
counterweights should've been on the inside (read: on the side where the
brake rotors are) instead of the outside.

They're little lead squares with their weight in grams and ounces
printed on it.  They're stuck to the wheel with a foamy/spongy kind of
doublesided adhesive tape.

I've discovered a slight shimmy in the steering wheel after a decent
labor day italian tune-up on Colorado backcountry mountain roads. ;-) 
So, since it is going to the shop tommorrow for a few minor things
(weatherstrips on rear hatch, driver and passenger door, hood shocks,
and to have the @#$%&! hatch release fixed for good) I'm thinking about
having all four phonedials w/ Dunlop SP4000A/S' electronically spin
balanced.  So, before someone in the shop messes things up, I'd rather
find out and know how things are done-right-slash-by-the-book(TM).

Anyone care to comment?

Thanks a bunch!

Cheers,
Chris
