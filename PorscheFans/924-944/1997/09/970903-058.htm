Marv has written about replacing glass and has said that his insurance company
has approved glass replacement shops that they will pay for the full amount and
other shops will only be paid the amount that the insurance would pay to their
approved shops.

This is highly illegal.  It is unlawful to direct business in the manner that
is suggested in this thread.  Sounds like something that State Farm tried to do
a few years ago and were sued over - they lost.

I would get a written copy of this policy and contact the state agency that
overlooks the insurance industry.  They would have a field day over this.
