 Hi Pfans

I am in the process of installing a new water pump  on my 86-951. The =
factory manuals I have on order have not come and it is almost time to =
replace the belts. I have the gage and tension settings, but I don't =
have the procedure for installation of the belts. I saw on the list a =
month or so ago someone talking about getting a copy of the procedure. =
If any of you good people out there could fax or email me a copy of the =
procedure for installing and tensioning the cam and balance shaft belts, =
I would be ever in your debt. Also, any thoughts you have on where to =
buy belts (aftermarket or dealer) would be appreciated. TIA

Kemp
