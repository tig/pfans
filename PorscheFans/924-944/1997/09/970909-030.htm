Longevity. How long is a piece of string?

We can assume a number of things.
The increased exhaust temperature in the pipe will create a higher
pressure in the pipe.
This will increase exhaust gas speed which should reduce lag. In theory.
Maximum turbine speed should be reached earlier. The wastegate will dump
excess gas so overspeeding the turbo shouldn't occur. Therefore the
turbo should not be running at either a higher max rpm or a
significantly higher temperature than before for a given boost setting.
You have not mentioned here, although you probably did earlier, what
material you used to insulate your manifolds with. What are you hoping
to achieve by doing this? Lower engine bay temp, more power, less lag?
If I was undertaking an engine bay temperature reduction exercise I'd
use high temp. ceramic coating from the manifolds through to the turbine
(hot) housing on the turbo to keep exhaust gas speed as high as
possible.

All,

I've got the manifolds insulated and back on.  I was asked by someone if
insulating the exhaust system increased engine temperature.  No,
obviously,
the gases have left the engine already.  However, in a turbocharged
vehicle,
the gas has yet to pass through the turbocharger.  My question is, does
increased exhaust gas temperature resulting from insulation of the
manifolds
have any effect on the operating temperature and/or longevity of the
turbocharger?
