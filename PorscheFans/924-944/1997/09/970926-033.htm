I've tried surfing the web to come up w/ road courses near Palm Springs, =
CA
-- but no luck.  Anybody live in the area that knows a course that would
not be too expensive to rent for a day? =

Nic k,

Come join PCA SD for time trials on October 18 and 19 at Holtville
racetrack/airport.  It is about two hours south of Palm Springs.  Head
south, hit Mexico, turn left and you are at a WW2 Air Force training base=
=2E =

I have never driven there but landed an airplane there once to watch a
race.  From those who have driven there and personal observation, it is
fast.  The back straight should make the boys with the high powered iron
pucker a bit.  I can hardly wait to give it a try.  If you like the cours=
e,
I understand they rent it out very reasonably.

If you or any others are interested let me know and I will get you the
information.

Jim Richmond
