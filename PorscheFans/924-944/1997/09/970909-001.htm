>My dilemma, I want a car with a reliable history. I don't and can't affo=

to spend more time in the shop than happily motoring along. I don't know =
a
lot about the history of either model as far as reliability or maintenanc=
e
costs go. Of course I would like to hop into the more prestigious of the
two models (which ever that is) but I'm trying to get my adrenaline to a
sane level and decide with my wallet and not my throttle foot. My wife, w=
ho
all the sudden has convinced herself that this is a mid-life crisis thing=
,
is having sleepless nights about what maintenance costs will be. I will
admit, she is starting to make me nervous. I know with any used car it is=

kind of like playing Russian Roulette but I like to increase my odds of
having one shell in the cylinder instead of six. =

Paul,

Here is the drill:   Read the PorscheFans archives, 924-944 flavor and FA=
Qs
(you will find the address when you read the archives) .  Shoot $30 and b=
uy
screen capture software so you can print the parts you want to save (buy =
a
case of paper).  $36 dollars in hand, join your local Porsche Club.  They=

will tell you which local shop they use to check out Porsches.  Spend the=

bucks for a complete(the $200 kind) check out.

They are both great cars with charms of their own.  If you want to smell
burning rubber, you had better plan on lighting one of your condoms on
fire.  Neither car is a powerhouse but they are excellent driving machine=
s.
 The FAQ and archives will tell you the strong points and genetic defects=
=2E =

You can take the power train warranty, perforate it and use it for t.p.. =

The engines and usually the transaxels are bullet proof.  Negotiate a
warranty on the clutch, waterpump, belts and rollers, motor mounts, etc..=
 =

This is the reason records are important.  I would probably wait until I
could find a car with complete service records so you know the milage on
the repairs.  =


As for mid-life crisis, I am currently working on my 4th one.  Remind you=
r
wife of her friend's rodent husband who went off to find himself with som=
e
bimbo.  Point out you just want the Porsche not the bimbo.  It is an iron=

clad guarantee that Porsche maintenance costs are far less than the cost =
of
a divorce.   Your wife will sleep like a rock and you can spend all your
waking hours tinkering with and polishing you car.
