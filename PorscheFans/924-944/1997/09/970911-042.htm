I've worked with lots of ball bearings in the past, and the best advice I 
can give you is that the decision to replace, or not replace, is subjective 
at best. I usually "feel" the movement in the bearing to see if there are 
any scratchy or rough sections in it's rotation, as well as too much side 
play or drag. The bearings for the belts are sealed by a plastic insert on 
each side of the races, and the insert can be removed (carefully) to check 
or replace the grease. Replace the bearings if they have any rough spots or 
are hard to turn. This usually means that the grease has gotten hot and 
partially solidified, and the balls or races are usually damaged when this 
happens.

I'd recommend that you replace the bearings if you have any doubts as to 
their condition. We all know how much damage can be done if one fails, and 
the replacements are not that expensive when compared to the cost of the 
repairs.
