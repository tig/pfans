Dean:

I work in Speedvision's playback. Being somewhat partial to 968s and the
like, I pay attention to when we air something 968/944/924 related.
Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything on us water-cooled folks. However,
one piece was on Porsche in general. I think it was called "In Search of
Excellence". We also just aired a piece on James Dean and his P-car. This
winter PCA's Connecticut Valley Region's meeting, they tried to have a
Boxster and a 550 Spyder, just like Dean's. The Boxster fell through, but
the Spyder didn't. It was an unrestored vehicle, owned by a gentleman
from MA, who's name escapes me for the moment. VERY COOL to see the real
thing, after airing video about it. FWIW, Cox is part owner of
Speedvision. Any of you others who don't get Speedvsion, but are on a Cox
cable system, it's time to go 'beat up' the general manager, and tell
them you want Speedvision. Direct  TV or Primestar have it, too. If I see
something 968/944/924 related, you know I'll spam the list about it. In
the meantime, Legends of Motorsports, has some very good archival stuff
from Porsches in the 50s and 60s.

Love that Formula 1 coverage.

any cars in the 924/944/968 series?
