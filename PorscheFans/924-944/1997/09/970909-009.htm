I have no interest in this sale, but I thought I would mention it for 
folks near the Eugene, Oregon area.

An upper end used car lot has:

87 951
Gold
90k miles
Good condition, but not concours.  It drives well, and there are no 
obvious faults, except the sunroof drive is broken.  Interior in good 
shape.  Turbo boost is definitely functional.  Engine sounds good.  A/C 
works.

I didn't see any service records, but the glove box manual package is 
present.

They have had this car for about 3 months, they are asking $11,000, which 
is probably very negotiable by now.  

Again, I have no interest in this car or the dealer, just posting in case 
someone in Oregon is looking for a 951.  Besides, I have been driving 
past it to work and back for the past 2 months and it looks lonely.  ;)

I would recommend getting the car checked by a shop before making any 
move on this, to avoid potential financial nightmare.  That might be why 
its been there for so long.
