well i got the K&N filter charger (removal of airbox later in post). the fit
is okay but i think it could be better. i do have a few questions.

1)  i want to take the throttle body out to clean it and i figure while it
is out i might have it bored, what it the normal bore size??

2)  is there any reason why i cannot unplug the wiring loom from the air meter??

3)  is there any need to remove the cover from the cam belts, etc. to make
up for the fact that the K&N does not have the outlet for it like the stock
air box does.

FYI, removal of the airbox is a pain because of the lower inside bolt.

TIA,

p.s. please dont ask HP questions as the car is not running (trans.
problems) it looks like a better setup than stock but i do not know about HP
or feel yet!
