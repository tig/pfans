Hello All,

I recently bought a 1989 944 Turbo which I thoroughly enjoy!  I have a
few problems with it that I hope to get fixed shortly with a little
advice from a seasoned porsche owner.  Any help would be very much
appreciated.

1)  At low speeds, my from brakes really squeel/squeak!  They also
produce a fair amount of brake dust.  I here that it is best to replace
the rotors also, so, are OE rotors found in Panorama for $69 ea. OK and
what brake pads do you recommend.  Also, where would you purchase them?
I do not plan on racing this car, except maybe once or twice at driver
education.

2)  Sometimes my Turbo does not kick in all the way.  The boost gage
only reads 1.4 BAR instead of 2.0 (I put Auto Authority chips in last
weekend).  I also noticed this with the factory chips.  I never really
know when I can count on FULL boost.  Any ideas.

3)  My oil light and goes on occasionally even though the oil gage is
pegged at  5.  I oil level is fine.  I use Syntech synthetic in the car.
 Sometime by just turning the car off and on, it goes out.  Is there two
separate sensing units?  Is this something easy to change.

4)  Since I don't know when the brake and transmission fluid were
replaced last, I want to change them.  What is the recommended fluid for
each and is synthetic better to use.

Thanks in advance for any responses provided!
