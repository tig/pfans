I haven't (yet) done a rear main seal, so can answer only from general 
principal.  Most techs pack the back of a radial oil seal with grease 
before installing it, I believe to cut down on the chance of its 
deforming or being damaged.

To install, I am happiest using a large, heavy press tool of some sort. 
 I have one, VW 2050 I think it's named, which gets used all the time. 
 I do this by hand, and basically just carefully whack the seal into 
position.  The oversize tool effectively bottoms out the installation 
flush with the surface, which is fine unless you need to inset it a bit 
like with rear stub axle seals.  This technique does work well for 
transmission rear plugs, front wheel bearing oil seals, and the like.

When installing one of these seal, height of installation is not 
critical, but "true" is.  By "true," I mean that you really want the 
seal to be installed to an even depth around its circumference.

Hope this helps.

Kevin
