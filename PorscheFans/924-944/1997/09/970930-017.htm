Hi Porschefans,
I have an oil leak and I was hoping someone can tell me if it is either 
my cam housing gasket or (eek!) my head gasket.

Facing the front of the car, to the left rear of the engine, below what 
I am calling the cam housing (?), there are numbers etched into what 
looks like the side of the block. I have always had a slight bit of 
caked on oil in this location. So I degreased the engine bay and kept an 
eye on it. Well...the next morning after a very spirited run, when I 
turned the car on I began to smell burning oil. Where I once had a 
non-perceptible leak, I now have very noticeable oil dripping onto my 
exhaust. 

Anyone else have such a leak, and if it is the cam housing...is it a 
terribly complicated job for a novice to attempt.

TIA
