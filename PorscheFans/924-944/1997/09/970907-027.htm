 I finally got all the parts and pieces and tools to change  pads and
rotors on my 1987 951... and went at it today.  Unfortunately I hit a
number of problems that finally stopped me, I was hoping you'd be able to
help or at least point me in a direction.  My car is an '87 Turbo, but I
think the directions you typed out were for the normally aspirated version,
since there were a couple differences right off.  Here is my status...

1.  I removed the wheel, but since I couldn't find a rachet nut to attatch
to the torque wrench,  I had to use the wrench in the spare tyre and
couldn't check how tight the lug nuts were on.  Nor, could I find that
specification in either the Haynes or the owner's manual.  Do you have a
suggested poundance to tighten them when I get back to putting the wheels
back on?

2.  The wire covering the pads was a big cross pattern.. but after staring
at it and wiggling it around for 20 minutes, I managed to figure it out..
<g>

3.  The brake pads were down to an absolute minimum, so the pistons are
sticking way out (sticking in toward the rotors).  I opened the outside
bleed nob (and made a mess when it took me five minutes to figure out that
the tube had come off the bleed hose and fluid was dripping all over..
D'oh!

Now it got hard:

4.  I tried and tried.. sprayed brake fluid all over.. (and inhaled the
rest)... sacrificed an old wrench to the "tight nut god,"  but I couldn't
get the two caliper bolts loose.  Should I try liquid wrench?  Do I need a
long rachet?  Should I go buy a magic potion from Gando the wizard?  Any
ideas?

5.  Since the rotors look like they have worn down by only about 2mm (the
amount of lip on the end, I'll measure the actual wear versus the new ones
in a bit).  It seems as though there is a ton of metal left on the rotor. 
How do you tell when it's time to change the rotors?  The dealer told me a
year ago that they were "under the legal limit by 2mm" but in looking at
the amount of wear, I'm thinking I shouldn't screw with it this time
around.  Damit.

6.  If I decide to change the rotors, I was planning on inserting the pads
in the calipers when I put them back over the new rotors.  If I can't get
those stupid bolts off and don't change rotors, how can I get the pistons
back enough to insert the pads?  Even with the bleen nob open, they barely
move and since they're the 4 piston type I can't get a wrench
on/over/under/around to force them back to stick the pads in.  Does the
dealer use a special secret tool?  Or, do I need to take some steroids and
get some double joints?

7.  Are the break pads the same size all the way around?  I have two boxes
from Vertex all the same part number with the front axle circled on a
little drawing of the car on the box.  Did they screw up and send me all
front brake pads?

Help!  My car is jacked up in my girlfriends garage and I have her car, but
obviously I gotta get this handled.  I appreciate the help since I'm  kinda
rather stuck... course, her 90 quattro isn't too bad.. <g>
