Hey, does anyone know what the "secret sauce" is that Chevron uses in
their fuel injector cleaner?  Surely just adding a chemical called
Techron to an otherwise normal cleaner could not be this amazing.  I was
going to remove my idle stabilizer and post the job to the list (I was
having a small idle problem and thought the stabilizer may be the
culprit).  I put two bottles of the cleaner in the tank at fill-up and,
approximately 1/2 tank later, the car is running awesome.  No more idle
problem, runs smoother, quieter and definitely quicker.  In fact, I
dusted a 928 (mine's a 944na).  OK, a teenage girl was driving the 928
and I don't think she was racing me.  Anyway I am sold on this stuff. 

Comparison

Ft. Myers, Florida
1985.5 944na purchased March 1996 $3,000.00 (mostly trashed) + $9,000.00
to bring up to concours level
I pay $1.45-$1.50 per gallon of Shell or Chevron premium gas
Insurance is $500.00 per year with $500.00 deductible
$40.00 hourly rate local shop / $60.00 per hour dealership / Try and do
the work myself.

Farzaan, great pics!!!
