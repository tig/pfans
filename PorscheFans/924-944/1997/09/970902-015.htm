Hi Mark,

First off, if the starter is making noise but works, you can try to
fix it yourself. If that doesn't work, you can replace it. George B
sells rebuilt units for a good price.

It's not as easy as the Haynes manual states, since you have a turbo
and there is always more stuff with a turbo, but it isn't a terrible
job. Basically, get the entire car up in the air, remove the belly
pans, disconnect the power to the starter, and remove two bolts that
hold the starter to the bellhousing.

Make sure to disconnect the battery before you do anything.

If I remember correctly, one of the bolts holding the starter is
an allen head. So make sure you have a selection of metric allen
head sockets. I bought a good set from The Home Depot (5mm-10mm)
for a good price. If you plan on doing any work on the car at all
you'll need the set. A large 1/2 drive breaker bar or ratchet is
also very handy. Be sure to use antisieze on the bolts when you
reinstall them.

After the starter is removed, if you want to try and fix it follow
the Haynes book on lubricating the solenoid. You problem might be 
a sticky solenoid. 

While you've got the starter out, take the time to bleed the clutch
hydraulic system. Right above the starter is the clutch slave cyl.
It has a bleed nipple on it, and you'll never have a better opportunity.
Be sure to keep the brake fluid reservoir absolutely full.

good luck,
