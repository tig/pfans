Hi,

Last week while driving my 951 suddenly both the tachometer
and the battery voltage needles all went to zero.  Immediately
I pull over but the car hardly moved and finally stalled.
Look pretty stupid pushing a porsche to one side of the street.
Does that mean that I have a bad alternator/regulator?  Anyway over the
weekend I pull the alternator.  While doing that I broke
the big rubber thing that connect the turbo to the air meter?
Basically the rubber piece which connects to the turbo became
hardened over the years and get stuck to the turbo.  Would
someone tell me how much is that rubber thing?

Also my car has tons of chip marks all over the hood.  Is there
anyway I can fix that without repainting the car.  I thing
touch-up paint won't work because it just have too many chip marks.

Hope I get some response from you fans.

Thanks,

Tom
