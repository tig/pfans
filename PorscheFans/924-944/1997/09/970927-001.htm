Subject: Sticky Speedometer

Hello all,

I have a Speedometer problem.

The car is a 1988 944 Turbo about to turn 100,000 miles.

The sixth year of ownership is getting to be an expensive one!

Anyway, back to my problem.
When I accelerate, the speedometer seems to read properly but it seems =
to not
come back down as the car slows down. It just seems to hold on to the =
highest
speed. When I start to slow down (by taking the transmission out of =
gear)
this speed will remain locked at the last high value. When I start to =
brake,
the needle very slowly comes back down. Usually, it seems to get back to =
zero
mph by the time I am stopped.

Anyone seen this behavior before?

I don't really want to hassle with any speedometer/odometer replacement
issues, so I'd much prefer to fix this unit.

The odometer seems to read fine. It continuously acquires miles at the =
proper
rate with no jerkiness - which is why I do not suspect the speedometer =
cable.

I assume that this unit is a regular mechanical unit and not one of =
those
fancy electronic ones. If so, I am hoping something is sticking or is
otherwise repairable.

Is the speedometer hard to get at?
Do I have to dismantle the whole dash?
Anyone know how to pull the speedometer out?

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Thomas Bapu
