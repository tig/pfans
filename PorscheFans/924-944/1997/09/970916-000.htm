> After slowing
down and bring the car to idle at a restaurant, I noticed the car was
idling erratically.
 I raised the hood on the car and noticed a vaccum leak was coming from t=
he
idle
screw (I guess that's what you call it).  "What happened to the *#*@~
screw?" was
my first response.  Next, I was trying to figure if I had been sucking di=
rt
into
my engine for the last 2 1/2 hours.  The restaurant was located next to a=
n
AUTOZONE
parts store and I bought a package of assorted vacuum caps for $2.31. =

After installation,
the idle immediately returned to normal.  Is this a common problem?  Will=

this vaccum
cap cause problems later? How important is that disappearing screw?<



The idle screw in my manifold also fell out.  Another great design job.  =
We
fixed it by drilling two holes above the screw in the casting and placing=
 a
cotter key through the holes.  We pull this key when adjustment is needed=
=2E =

 My car didn't run well (high speed bucking) until the screw was replaced=
