924/944/968 series vehicle identification labels, which include the
equipment option numbers, have, since 1982, been attached to the rear
valance panel in the rear storage area.  It is a small paper label glued to
the painted surface near the spare tire well.  Remember, however, this will
list only the equipment which was installed at the factory prior to
shipment to the original selling dealer.  If yours is missing, then you
should contact PCNA in Reno about getting the Certificate of Authenticity.

Happy hunting

     RJ,
     
        Amplified Bazookas won't be able to do it.  You have to get another 
     amp and build a speaker box with separate subs.  But you have a 
     problem here.  You said you want both SERIOUS and BOOMING bass.  That 
     will be tricky because a ported enclosure will give you BOOM, but it 
     won't sound serious.  If you want accurate sound at any of the lows 
     and not just at a tuned frequency, build a sealed enclosure.  Don't 
     believe others when they say you can have both serious and booming 
     bass with a bandpass enclosure.  They just don't sound right, but it's 
     deifinitely a neat concept.
        By the way, if BOOM is more important to you and you want to save 
     money, make a ported box because they require less power (cheaper amp) 
     to hit hard.
        I have made a sealed enclosure that fits behind the rear seats and 
     doesn't protrude over the edge of the seats either (and sorry Anders, 
     I haven't had a chance to buckle, harness, and weld it down yet :)  ). 
      There are 2 subs (JL Audio 10W6's) that point straight up, and I have 
     231 watts (continuous) going to EACH.
        Listen to a set of subs powered by a decent amp, and I guarantee 
     you'll forget all about the tubes...

     Greetings all,
     
     I have a 90 944 S2 Cab with a 4 channel Kenwood KRC 602. 
     The 602 will push out about 30 watts rms.
     The system sounds great but I would like to add some serious, 
     serious BASS. I mean BOOMING bass.
     So far the only thing I can come up with is a a pair of 6" 
     bazookas and a seperate power amp.
     
     Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated.
