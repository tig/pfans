     I have a 1981 924 that could use a "little" work. I have power
     windows that need replacing on the right hand side. The motor is
     fine but the regulator went south. When I took everything apart. I
     realised alot of the orginal mounting screws were gone. Has anyone
     in this group ever done anything like that.

     Also I am toying with the idea of getting a 924 turbo (931). I
     would appreciate any advice on what to look for in a good example.
     I would probably get a 1981 or 82 with the 928 rims. Any body got
     any opinions????

     Could I keep the 924, if I got the turbo and use it as a "parts"
     car?


     Thanks for any and all Responces.

     Mark

      P.S  As far as I know the 924 is the only one out of the whole
     924-968 line that has gotten to hold the name Carrera. Is this
     correct.
