I have to agree with the respondents thus far - Stay Away from this one! 
 My 951 was super clean and all the creature comforts worked great and I 
still sunk $$$$ in it.  There are lots of 944s, especially the normally 
aspirated models, out there.  If I had it to do over again I would have 
watched this list for 6 mos and then looked very closely for the right car 
avoiding the immediate lust that comes over one taking a test drive!
