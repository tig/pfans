     If the nose piece is aligned with the fender properly and tightly, 
     then perhaps you need to look for slack and adjustment that can be 
     made down lower, like where the chin spoiler, wheel-well tub, and nose 
     peice all join together.  There is some room for correction at these 
     lower corners that can be accessed in front of the wheels.  Maybe if 
     you secure the nose piece to the tub or chin piece lower, it won't 
     "pinch" the plastic and make it bulge out like that.  Just a 
     conjecture as to how you may be able to alleviate the pressure (I'm 
     thinking its being squashed into deformity, and not just drooping).
     
     90% of all 944's I've seen also have this peculiar bulge on at least 
     one side of the nose piece.

Hi Jim,
     
Thanx for the timely response.  I'll try you suggested adjustments but I don't
 know if that will solve the problem. I think I described the problem poorly. 
 The problem is with the curvature of the fender portion of the bumper cover 
 being too great on one side.  The seam where it mates to the metal fender is 
 aligned OK.  I may have lead you to interpret that from my post and if so, I 
 apologize.
     
The problem is apparent when you look at the car standing in front of it.  One
 side of the bumper cover (fender portion) bulges out more than the other.
     
I'll try some adjustments this weekend and give your suggestion a shot.  May
 even take off the bumper cover belly pan to gain more access to the front wheel 
 well ( been there - fasteners galore! )
     
BTW -  Yeah, I've dealt with that little wheel well access door before when I
 replaced my windshield washer fluid bottle (with one from George B.).  Not much 
 room in there.  I finally figured out the thing comes out the bottom, not the 
 top.  Oh well, I needed to learn something about the disassembling the 
 headlight mechanism anyway!
     
I can hear my 1/4" drive ratchet clicking already......
     
Thanx for the advice,
     
Dean

Of the two people who have looked at my '87 951 I have for sale, both of 
them have also noted something about the front bumper covers of some of the 
951s they have seen which is something that also afflicts my car.  One side 
of the fender portion of the bumper cover sticks-out a little more than 
normal.  I have noticed this flaw on several 951s I have seen also. I have 
also seen 951s with both sides sticking out a little too much.
     
I'm guessing this may be caused by the polyurethane nose drooping a little, 
thus causing the fender portion to stick out a bit.  My bumper cover was 
replaced with a  used part though....  Anyone else noticed this or better 
yet - can it be easily fixed?
<
     
Dean,
     
Sorry, easily fixed and Porsche do not go together.  The easy fix would be 
to give it a whack and see if you could align it that way.  Getting to the 
bolts is a PITA but since you asked.  Pull the wheel and open the access 
door in the front of the fender well.  Remove the plastic finger nuts from 
the running light and remove.  Take a 1/4" drive 10mm universal socket and 
loosen the bolts holding the urethane nose to the fender.  Align, tighten 
and reverse the procedure.  There is not much room to work through the 
access panel so you probably would be better off removing the plastic 
fender liner, I did.
     
Sorry to hear you are selling your car.  Hope you hang in with the list, I 
always enjoyed your comments.
