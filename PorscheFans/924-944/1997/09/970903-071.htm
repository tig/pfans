1.  Seattle, WA
2.  '86 951, $12,200 (5/96).  67,000 miles, absolutely flawless,
included chips & suspension mods
3.  $152.9/gallon 92 octane Chevron
4.  $900/year.  34, single, full coverage, two cars, both insured as
pleasure only vehicles (I walk to work).
5.  $70/hr

It was either the car, or $20,000 in therapy.  I made the right
decision.
