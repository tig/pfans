Greetings all,

	After a week of test driving I'll call the job done.  Never has the car
shifted as smoothly as it does now.  For those thinking of doing the job
yourself, it's really not that bad.  I'd like to thank all those who took
an interest in this project especially Barry Lenoble, who offered up some
critical information not included in the Haynes manual.


What I did wrong:

<paraindent><param>left</param>Not getting all parts and tools I needed
at one time at the beginning of the project.  Caused unnecessary 
delays.

Not knowing that the coupler between the drive shaft and the input shaft,
slides completely back onto the latter.  This made transmission removal
much more difficult.

</paraindent>

What I did right:

	Buying air compressor/tools.

	Shopping around for the best price.  I could have spent double.

	Took my time.


Replaced:

	Clutch disc, pressure plate including bolts, throw-out bearing, rear
main seal, pilot bearing, release lever bearings, axle shaft flanges and
input shaft seal.

Flywheel was resurfaced.


Tips:

	Drain some coolant and disconnect the coolant hose going into the heater
valve.  When connect, the 2 hoses attached to the bottom of the heater
valve push down on the clutch housing, making it almost impossible to
remove.  An assistant pulling upward on the removed hose will provide
enough clearance to remove the housing easily.


	On installation, instead of tightening the drive tube to transmission
bolts fully before sliding the coupler into position, leave them a little
loose.  This allows you to wiggle the drive tube while sliding the
coupler into position.


	A screwdriver wedged between the starter ring gear and the frame will
keep the pressure plate from rotating while removing the pressure plate
bolts.


	To keep the flywheel from rotating when it's bolts are removed, insert a
screwdriver in the right starter bolt hole.  Thread a pressure plate bolt
into a hole on the right side of the flywheel.  Wedge a second
screwdriver handle first against the frame with the shaft under the first
screwdriver and then extending over the bolt.  Rotate the flywheel to the
left until everything is tight.


	The flywheel bolts are ripe to round out.  A 1/4 inch drill bit for
drilling hardened metal worked well for removal.  The bit just fits into
the head of the bolt.  Drill past the bolt head.  The bit isn't as wide
as the bolt shaft, so after drilling far enough, I inserted a screwdriver
in the hole and wiggled the head and it came right off.


	If you have the car on ramps as I did, you can't rotate the rear wheels
to position the drive shaft coupler for bolt removal.  Instead, turn the
crank shaft bolt (24 mm) with a breaker bar until the shaft is in
potion.


	If you remove the speed/flywheel reference sensors, removing the sensor
block is unnecessary.


	Get a seal puller.  Never used one before, but the added leverage was
necessary to remove the rear seal.  The tool was even more useful at
removing the pilot bearing.  I hooked the curved end into the hole and
pulled up to lock it's position and removed it out with a few taps of the
hammer.  The method listed in the Haynes manual did not work for me.


	Mark the position of the exhaust system hangers to the drive tube.  It
will make it a little easier on reinstallation of the exhaust system.


	Even after using the alignment tool, the drive shaft is difficult to
insert fully into the pilot bearing.  If you are sure everything is
aligned, you can tighten the drive tube to clutch housing bolts to draw
the shaft into position.  Make sure the rear of the tube is supported and
up a little so it is level.


	That's about all the highlights.  If anyone has a question,  let me
know.
