Good Luck,

I'll start the ball rolling for the 944 book and answer some pending ques=
tions =

at the same time. Due to time constraints I will tackle this one step at =
a =

time. the first subject will be:
"Reconditioning your sunroof cables and gears"
Here is the procedure to remove the drive cable, gearbox and latch assemb=
ly of =

your pre 1987 944.
To start this process you need to have the sunroof out and the latches fu=
lly =

retracted.
Step one - Remove the panel that covers the sunroof gearbox and latches. =
To be =

found behind the sunroof and can be removed with 5 screws.
Step two - Unscrew the gearbox and the latches. (pretty obvious)
Step three - Unscrew the sunroof gear box cover (White plastic) and remov=
e the =

main drive cable and it's tube. This is the cable that drives the 'big' g=
ear =

and the first cable that you will see when you open the gearbox. Then set=
 =

aside the gearbox and latches (we will look at these later).
Step four - Back to the left rear quarter and the sunroof motor assembly.=
 =

remove all the attaching hardware (2 nuts in front and 1 screw in back). =

Carefully twist the motor so that you can see the 'other' side of the mot=
or. =

You should see a white plastic cover plate (approx 1" x 3") that is held =
in by =

three phillips head screw. Remove this cover and this should allow you to=
 pull =

the motor assembly away and towards the rear of the car (you have to pull=
 =

backwards while pointing the rear of the motor assembly to the center of =
the =

car). Move the sunroof assembly enough so that you can see the side of th=
e =

track that faces the fender. You will see a white plastic piece that slid=
es =

inside the track. The cable is attached to this piece (you can't see that=
 =

yet). This plastic piece is actually two pieces joined together about 1/3=
 of =

the way back (from the front). Use a small flat blade screw driver to sep=
arate =

these two pieces.
Step five - Undo the electrical leads to the motor assembly. This is unpl=
ug =

located below the assembly.
Step six - Now you can remove the motor assembly.
Step seven - Measure the amount of the drive cable that is exposed. This =
will =

important later in the re assembly process. Pull out the drive cable. Thi=
s may =

be fairly stiff!!
Step seven - Clean up the old grease and muck (!) on the cable. Use what =
ever =

obnoxious chemical you like the best!
Step eight - Cleaning the guide. This is a bit of a pain. I used some of =
the =

aerosol carb cleaner because it allowed me to use the little tube that go=
es =

into the spry nozzle, I inserted this tube into the cable housing at the =

sunroof and seal the tube with paper towels. At the same time I put a =

container below the end of the tube in the rear quarter. Then I sprayed l=
ike =

hell.
Step nine - Lube the cable with the grease of your choice. I had a hard t=
ime =

deciding if it should be a light grease for easy movement or a heavier gr=
ease =

because of the heavy loads that are encountered at the bends. I used some=
 of =

the synthetic grease that I had for my CV joints, it works fine.
Step ten - Reinsert the cable housing. May require a little 'persuasion',=
 if =

this hangs up try 'screwing' the cable in. There is a fair amount of fric=
tion =

when the cable goes around the bends.
Step eleven - Back to the rest of the 'guts'. All that is needed is a bas=
ic =

cleaning and re assembly. Inspect the gear to see if it needs replacement=
=2E =

This is a common failure and you don't want to do this again unless you a=
re a =

masochist.
Step twelve - Re installing the upper assembly. The gear box has to be =

reassembled with the main drive cable.  Important - the latches must be a=
t the =

same position relative to their bodies.
Step thirteen - Screw the gear box in place followed by the latches. (don=
't =

reattach the panel until we make sure this works!
Step fourteen - Back to the rear quarter. By screwing the drive cable in =
or =

out we need to adjust the cable back to the same position before it was =

removed. This does not have to be exact - just close.
Step fifteen - Insert the cable into the track and reconnect the two plas=
tic =

pieces in the track.
Step sixteen - The end of the drive cable housing has a tab the needs to =
be in =

the correct position in order to sit flat in the white plastic housing. T=
o do =

this the motor assembly needs to be near verticle. This makes it a pain t=
o put =

the plastic cover with the three screws in place. Be careful the plastic =
does =

not respond well to force.
Step seventeen - Test roof operation. This can be done without reattachin=
g the =

motor assembly - just make sure it's in approx. the same location.
Step eighteen A - Rejoice. Reattach the motor assembly and go dive somewh=
ere =

while making the sunroof go up and down repeatedly
Step eighteen B - Get depressed. However there are still some other solut=
ions =

- If the roof still binds it may be that your clutch needs adjusting (No,=
 the =

sunroof clutch smart ass) This can be done with a pair of needle nose pli=
ers =

in about two minutes.

Sunroof Clutch Adjustment Chapter
Step one - Remove the carpeting at the left rear quarter.
Step two - look at the motor! Find the manual operation screw / bolt. (Ch=
eck =

your owner manual if you don't know where it is)
Step three - Where this screw (actually it is a bolt) enters the motor bo=
dy =

you will see a nut that looks like a locking nut. This is the clutch =

adjustment nut.
Step three - Adjust the nut. Requires a needle nose pliers in most cases.=
 =

Clock wise for tighter and counterclockwise for looser. BE CAREFUL - The =

plastic gear in the gear box by the sunroof cannot take the full force of=
 the =

motor. Lucky for us most of the friction is between the motor and the pla=
stic =

gear.
Step four - Make sure that the microswitches are adjusted so the the moto=
r is =

not trying to push or pull the pour little plastic gear at the end of the=
 =

range of sunroof motion.
