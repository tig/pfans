Hi all

First time writing here, sorry to say but I have a problem.  My 
champagne 86' 944 has gotten two days of use from me and got sick.  This
is what happened.  Stopped at a stop light, turned green put in first
took off... everything fine.  About 20mph put in 2nd everything fine...
about 25 mph CLUNK! JERK! "OH NO!!!"  The whole rear end seems to jerk
as if the tranny is catching on something...  No matter what gear 1st,
2nd 3rd, reverse whatever it does this... even in neutral and you push
the car when it is not running.  It is a repeating jerk and whoomp noise
that seems to come from the rear of the vehicle.  Happens about every
foot and a half distance the car moves.  Any suggestions are welcome!
I am only 19 years old and spent every cent on this beauty (its
absolutely showroom condition! not a scratch or ding!) and am scared
about how much I might be looking at as far as a repair goes...

Dear Eric & P-Fans
	 I had a similar problem with my '86 951. You're not going to be happy when
you read this but I'm just the messenger.....  I was shifting from 1st to 2nd
gear - a slow shift from 4200 RPM's, then wham-o! Clunk/Click/Cluck!  The
noise was the same as you describe the repeating jerk and whoomp noise - that
seems to come from the rear of the vehicle. In my case it was ---- The
Transmission!  After pulling the transmission out and disassembling it, I
found that the 2nd gear on the main shaft was missing two teeth! The 2nd gear
on the main shaft only had teeth 80% around the circumference. I understand
that the 2nd gear in the 951's (not "S" models though) is the weak link,
especially when speed shifting.  One month and $ 3K latter -  my rebuilt
 transmission is now shift smoothly with no strange noises. I replaced all
the bearing, syncros, main shaft, 2nd & 3rd gears. I also took the
opportunity to install a ZF-Limited slip. For your information the Porsche
dealers have factory rebuilt exchange transmissions for $2800-$3200. At first
I thought I would not have to spend that much to rebuild my trans, but the
ZF-Limited slip pushed the tab to almost that much! $3K - Ouch! 

						Good Luck, DJ.
