Eric,
	Proper and even torque seem very important on this car.  I had a shake a
60 mph after getting the car back from a rotation and balance.  When I
started loosing lugs I noticed the torque ranged from 60 to 130 (good old
impact wrench).  Cleared up when I re-torqued.  I personally torque to 92.
