We saw the new 996 and though you'd like to hear some tidbits:

- the car sounds really good, more Ferrari like than before, but still the
  classical noise is there.
- the looks at first are hard to get used to.  When viewed alone, the 996
  does not look that good, but put it next to a 993 and all of a sudden,
  the once-fabulous 993 starts to look like the once-fabulous 964.  When
  compared to each other, the 993 looks very, very old and hard edged.
- the dash of the new 996 is ugly, it's the Boxster unit.  When I'm driving
  fast, I like the needle to be swisting off the scale.  0km/h is at
  around 7o'clock on the dial and 300km/h is at about 11o'clock on the dial.
  At least they left the rev counter where it should be.

Porsche factory people were awesome to talk to.  Even the gate keeper
asked our opinion of the new car.  He says the car has a lot more to it
than looks alone.  The first 911 to drive really nice at high speed,
apparently the top speed is very, very high (around 175mph) and the HP
rating conservative.
