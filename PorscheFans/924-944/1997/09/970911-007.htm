Right.

The round pads at the front of the car are I think meant for jacking / holding
all four corners at the same time so that the load is distributed evenly over
the face of the pad. This would be the normal case when raising the car with
a lift or hanging it from an overhead conveyor.

But if you jack on one of those you can easily load up one edge and bend it
into the floor. This can also happen if you have the front of the car
supported on jackstands using those pads and then lower one side of the car
using the central jacking point.

I have seen a couple with bent pads from jacking so I know it happens.
