Paul White asks:

What I ask of any respondents:
WHICH CAR WOULD YOU LEAN TOWARDS IF THIS WERE YOU!!!
and any insight as to any tweaks I should be looking for? (good or bad)

Thank-you in advance to all who respond.

Hey Paul-

My .02 is that neither will meet your primary objective of inexpensive,
reliable transportation. Any sports car, particularly a Porsche, is gonna be
a bit more expensive to maintain that basic transportation. If you do your
own service, or better yet, if you enjoy doing your own service, then it's
not really a negative.

If your bound and determined to have your mid-life crisis in a Porsche (I've
had three of 'em now), I'd go with the 924S.  The engine and transmission are
far superior technologically.  There should be a significant performance edge
to the 924S also.  I think the only advantage of the 944 is the appearance.
 I think the 944's a drop dead gorgeous car, although the 924S has a
personality of it's own.

I'd think REAL hard about buying either from a used car joint where the
history is questionable.

Once you're on the Porsche trail, though, it's hard to turn back.  If you get
one, good luck!  Stay tuned to the list.  You'll pick up a lot of good tips.
