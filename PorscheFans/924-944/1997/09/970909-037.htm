Doug,
     I used the boot off a replacement ball joint for '85 and older 944's, 
which is also the same ball joint used on VW rabbits. If your local parts 
place has a difficult time locating it, I can find a part number for you. I 
looked at several different parts suppliers, and found there to be slight 
differences in the diameter of the ball joint itself, all of which were 
smaller than on our alloy A-arms. However, the boot is large enough, and has 
shown no signs of degradation after ~5k miles this summer on my vehicle. I 
fully expect the boot to outlast the joint.


  Although I replaced my boot with the A-arm removed, I am sure you can do it 
with the A-Arm on the vehicle. The only difficult part of removal is getting 
the ball joint out of the spindle. In order to do this, you must completely 
remove the bolt which clamps down on the ball joint stud. Once you have the 
A-arm free to swing down, the boot is held on by a metal clip, I used a small 
flat head screwdriver to carefully remove it. Start by removing the clip on 
your old damaged boot for practice, you will need to re-use this clip. Then, 
remove the clip on the new boot, be carefull not to nick the boot! With your 
ball joint exposed, examine it, make sure there isn't any free play (new 
joints can not be moved by hand without leverage, older ones should still be a 
bit stiff). I added some mobile1 grease to the joint, hopefully it is 
compatible with whatever grease was used on the joint at the factory.  The new 
boot will seem a bit tight, but it will slip on. Carefully place the original 
clip back around the boot. Probably one of the simplest repairs I have done to 
my vehicle, and for less than $15, I am not complaining. Sure beats a $150 
rebuild.

Good Luck!
   Ezra
