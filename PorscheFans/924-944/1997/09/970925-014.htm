Hi Mike, was this by outbraking him or acclerating past?

[Michael G. Wachholz] =20

Is was by driving faster through turns 1 & 2 and by better driving =
through the remainder of the track.  I am a substantially more =
aggressive driver than the S2 guy.  I go into turn 1, a banked sweeper, =
without lifting or braking at 135 - 140.  The S2 guy is lifting quite a =
bit.  I go into turn 2, a flat, very long sweeper, at approx. 115 and =
exit between 118 - 120.  By this time the S2 in an insect in my mirror.

Since your description showed you could'nt pull away from him in the
straight, you put 5 seconds on him in the twisties? Are you running OEM
suspension? M030/P31? R tyres? TIA

[Michael G. Wachholz] =20

I am putting most of the distance on him in 1 & 2, however when I follow =
him in the twisties, he is braking earlier and not getting on the =
throttle as early as I do.  We also drive slightly different line in =
certain corners.  The manner in which I know I am 5 seconds faster =
overall is by comparing the best times in your region's timed runs.  My =
best time is 1:57.6 and the S2 is 2:02.  (OK, so 4.5 seconds difference)

I am running a completely stock OEM suspension on a 968 w/81k miles.  I =
am using R1s in 245/45/17 front and 275/40/17 rear on Forgeline wheels, =
Porterfield racing brake pads and the only modification is the S4 =
calipers have been installed on the front axle.  The S2 has had =
suspension work done to it, i.e. bigger torsion bars, sway bars, shocks, =
etc.

The bottom line is I have been a very aggressive driver this season and =
I have learned a lot very quickly.  In all honesty, I am probably only a =
slightly better driver than the S2 but I am more comfortable at higher =
speeds than he is.  BIR is a high speed track consequently those with a =
higher comfort level can produce better lap times.
