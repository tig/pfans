Here are some answers to questions from a few day's digest that I can
remember:

1. There seem to be a bunch of people who are having the boost cut off at
   1.2-1.4bar(a) and are wondering how to solve this.  There are two things
   we must understand before we find a fix.  1. When is this occuring, and
   2. Does it occur all the time.  If it occurs under WOT, then you can skip
   to the bottom for the solutions that I've found.  If it doesn't occur
   under WOT, but rather under part throttle, you'll have to live with it
   as that is how the factory system works, 1.2bar(a) under part throttle,
   1.8bar(a) under wide open.  If you don't want to live with it, you'll
   need a drilled cycling valve, but that's not recommended for someone new
   with turbo cars.

   To solve the WOT 1.2bar(a) problem, get some contact cleaner from Radio
   Shack or whatever and get some dust remover spray.  Take off the connector
   at the air flow meter (barn door) and clean both male and female and 
   take off the connector for the throttle position sensor and do same.
   Blow any contact cleaner out of there and re-connect.  If it no longer
   restricts your boost, you've solved the problem.  If it still continues,
   then check your TPS for proper readings.  On Paul's car, the TPS connector
   needed a cleaning, it was occuring on and off for quite some time.  I
   finally took the connector off and cleaned it thoroughly with contact
   cleaner and all is fine now, hasn't happened since (been about 1 month
   now).  Same happened with me with the air flow meter connector.  Cleaned
   and all fine now.  Some people say that the TPS does fail frequently.

   Last area to check, and everyone should do this is the compressor bypass
   valve.  Make sure that you can't blow through it when you take it off.
   If you can, replace it with the 993TT part.  If anyone has the part
   number for the new 993 part, let me know, I'd like to test it.

2. The S0-2's are on the car now.  I can't really comment on their dry
   stick yet as they are not broken in, but the wet performance is
   quite amazing and it has been VERY wet out here lately.

3. Hoosier tire pressures.  For auto-x, we used 45psi front and 40psi rear.
   It made the car very neutral with the stock "S" suspension.  For road
   race situations, you want somewhere around 40-45psi HOT at the end of
   your lapping session, so probably start around 38/36psi.  For track events,
   I would recommend people try the Kumhos or the R1, rather than the
   Hoosier.  The Hoser is great at Autocross, but not really too durable 
   under track conditions.  The Hoser would be great for a qualifying session
   though :)

4. It's been over 1 year now with my 944 Turbo!  It's also been over 1 year
   now without a stereo in the car, that's pretty good in my books.  That
   should compliment Porsche engineers that designed the sound of the exhaust.
   Even more impressive for me is that it's been 1 year now with only chips
   and I'm still impressed by the car's performance, and I still can't drive
   consistently at the limits of the car on the track!  I like a car that can
   keep a boost junky like me at bay for over a year.

Hope that helps,
Farzaan "I really need a full boost 4th gear sweeper right now" Kassam.
