Hi all

	First time writing here, sorry to say but I have a problem.  My 
champagne 86' 944 has gotten two days of use from me and got sick.  This
is what happened.  Stopped at a stop light, turned green put in first
took off... everything fine.  About 20mph put in 2nd eveything fine...
about 25 mph CLUNK! JERK! "OH NO!!!"  The whole rear end seems to jerk
as if the tranny is catching on something...  No matter what gear 1st,
2nd 3rd, reverse whatever it does this... even in neutral and you push
the car when it is not running.  It is a repeating jerk and woomp noise
that seems to come from the rear of the vehicle.  Happens about every
foot and a half distance the car moves.  Any suggestions are welcome!
I am only 19 years old and spent every cent on this beauty (its
absolutly showroom condition! not a scratch or ding!) and am scared
about how much I might be looking at as far as a repair goes...
