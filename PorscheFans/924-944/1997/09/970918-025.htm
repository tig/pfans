>Jeff, both Koni and Bilstein provided units on Cup Cars. The front shock
was ride height adjustable and ran a conical shape spring similar to the
Turbo S cars (though stiffer). The Koni unit had external rebound
adjustment. The Bilstein unit wasn't adjustable. The cars ran a 30mm
non-adjustable front sway bar. On the rear the cars used a coil-over "helper
spring" shock setup in addition to torsion bars. Both the Koni and Bilstein
rear units were threaded and the Koni unit was double adjustable (rebound
and compression). The cars ran a 19 or 20mm (not positive) rear sway bar
that had 3 holes in it for adjustment.
