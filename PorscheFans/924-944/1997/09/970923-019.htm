Yeah, me too on my '87 red/black 944S!

>After re-doing the cam cover gasket, no improvement
>(sorry Marv...I tried). 

Oh yeah, did that too!

So small that it looks as if the blood/oil is just puddling a bit doesn't it?

>Never mind that, it'll fix itself...*sniff*

No it won't

>The crack is too small to see, but the oil coming out of it sure isn't. 

A return oil galley and a porous casting caused mine.  After much gnashing
of teeth, and tearing out of hair, I noticed that the amount leaked was so
small, (less than 1/2 qt. between oil changes) that I calmed down.  If the
leak had not ended up smoking on the exhaust (#3) header pipe, I probably
wouldn't have noticed it for a long time.  So, I built a little diverter to
assure that the oil did not cause that embarrassing smoking at the stop
light, and resolved that when the amount of oil lost amounts to something, I
will take the head off and weld the crack.  (used heads are $$$$)

>...heartbroken and bereaved in Ohio....

Ohio tends to do that to people....but your 944S is probably taking this
better than you are...take her out for a spin, and tell her you still love
her despite this blemish.
