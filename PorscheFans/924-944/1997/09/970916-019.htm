OK, from what I've read, lots of us have this problem, and it's always
something stupid that seems to fix it.  Well, I *might've* fixed it, and
if I did, it sure as hell was pretty stupid.  It was exhibiting its
greatest symptoms at about 67mph, and would fade out almost completely by
65 and 70.

I wanted to see the brakes on my car, so I jacked it up and took off the
wheels (only one side).  Having seen them (the brakes), I put the wheels
back on, put the bolts in, tightened them until the wheel wouldn't move
and then a couple turns more, let the car down, and tightened them to
about 70 ft-lbs each.  (Is that going to be too much?  The head bolts can
take 70+, and I think they're smaller.)  The shaking then went away. 
Completely.

What did I do?
