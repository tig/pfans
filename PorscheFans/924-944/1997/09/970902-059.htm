Hello,

My name is Douglas Wagner and I'm in the middle of changeing the flex
disc on my 85.5 944 automatic. I've run into deep trouble trying to get
the drive shaft off the engine bell houseing. I have many questions I
hope someone knows an answer to.

I have removed the four bolts from the shaft to bell houseing also the
bolt inside the bell houseing that goes to the cupler- I only saw one
and hope thats all there was because when I tried to pry the shaft off
the cupler moved underneath the broken piece of rubber and now I can't
get the rubber back off. I can get the shaft moved almost two inches out
from the bell houseing. I think the coupler is sliding back but the
shaft is to the point where it doesn't want to move at all now and I'm
getting a workout trying every position possible to get leverage. The
shaft inside appears to have another piece around the teeth on the end
of the shaft and it is moveing out with the shaft. Is that ok? There
also seems to be a peice of metal welded to the side of it and it looks
broken or just rubbed off from trying to pry it out. Does turning the
shaft 90 degrees also apply to automatic shafts? How much further does
the shaft move before its free of the bell houseing? I'm afraid that if
I can't get this off for some reason that I'll have to cut the bell
housing and the rubber piece to to see what is going on.
Also there seems to be something on top of the bell houseing that is
still holding it on. I thought I removed all the cables connected to the
houseing.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is a monumental project for
me.

Best,
Douglas Wagner

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
