	I was on my way home from cashing in a lotto ticket. A $37 win. I
thought my luck had changed. Round the next corner it did. Some fool in
a 4 door cut across the road from the oncoming lane directly in front of
me. I now have one very broken 951. And I was worried about stonechips.
Left hand fender and suspension wrecked, right hand fender, bumper, all
front lights, bent left chassis rail, hood warped, exhaust, rear
airfoil, possible bent rims etc etc. All this will be sorted out by my
insurance broker and I'm not too worried, other than not having my car.
The driver of the other car was at fault and I have lots of witnesses to
back me up. What I want to know is has anybody had any experience in
suing the other driver, or of course in being sued themselves in a
similar situation. I will be taking legal advice in the morning after I
get my aches and pains checked out.

Thanks

Richard.
driving Ford pickup is not that cool
