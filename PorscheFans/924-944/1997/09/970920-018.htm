Hello out there-

I would like to preface this by saying I got this off of the Audi user's
digest I am also a member of.  I am not the originator of this but was
wondering what everyone on this list thought about this advice.  It is a way
to "fix" noisy lifters.  So here is a transcript:

>I change my oil regularly - but when I changed the lifters I was appalled at 
>what drained out of them - a jet-black fluid with the consistency and 
>appearance of water from a peat bog.

>I actually found myself wondering whether it would be worthwhile, on alternate 
>oil changes, to lift them out and drain them ...

>Then I mused this aloud to Martin at BR Motorsport.  He looked around to
see if 
>anyone (including his boss, I suspect) was looking and then suggested the 
>following (engine hot):
 
>a) Drain the oil.
 
>b) Remove the filter.
 
>c) Remove the plugs.
 
>d) Ground the HT lead from the coil.
 
>e) Pull the fuel pump relay.
 
>f) Spin the engine twice on the starter, each time for five seconds with
>   a half-minute gap.
 
>g) Replace, rebuild and refill.
    
>I haven't tried this.  I think I might, at the next oil change.  I suspect the 
>effect is not much different to what happens when you use a non-turbo (i.e., 
>no anti-drainback valve) filter.  The lifter oilways will drain out, and the 
>first few lifter actions will pump oil _out_ of the lifters, not in.

So what is the consensus?  Will this do irreversable harm to the engine?  I
wouldn't mind getting all the old oil out of the lifters to keep them
working their best.  BTW the place mentioned is a shop in the UK.

Later,
