Finished the steering rack project Saturday.  All seems OK, I had the 
alignment done today at the dealer and they said everything looked good. 
 If I were to do it over here are some tidbits:

Have at least 6 of those brass washers/seals and replace all of them (calls 
for 4 on the rack itself).

Rent a garage with a lift!  The height you get with jackstands makes this a 
contortionists dream!

Follow the haynes manual, it is pretty close but leaves alot of the power 
steering related stuff to the imagination.

Hardest part, getting the u joint from the steering wheel on the splined 
end of the steering rack! If you have large hands forget it!

Whole project took about 8 hours but that includes the cursing and a few 
frustration breaks.

Tools you will need:
Sockets: 13mm, 17mm, 19mm (1/2 inch drive for strength)
Allen sockets 6mm (1/2 inch drive for strength)
Large Crescent wrench to remove the tie rod assemblies from the steering 
rack
Possibly a pickle fork if your tie rods ends are really pressed in, mine 
popped out pretty easily
Locktite (red)
A crowbar and a few blocks of wood (about 10-12 inches long) will help 
getting the tie rod ends off if yours loosen up before you get the nut all 
the way off.

P.S. since you will have to remove the sway bar you may want to replace all 
the bushings and there are also some rubber bushings that fit around the 
steering rack so get some of those as well.  I also replaced the boots 
since one had a small hole.
