> I have been flamed for being employed by 3M and mentioning 3M
products that would solve many of the problems on the list.  I have kept
quiet
on a number of issues but will try once again on this subject.  If it is
uncool
to do so, I will stop.  I do not make money in any form off of these
suggestions, just trying to be helpful.

Mark,

Please let us know any products and part numbers you feel would help solv=
e
any of the list problems.  The purpose of this list is the exchange of
information.  I filed your excellent post on paint cleaners and waxes and=

use it as a reference. =


Flaming someone who has done scientific comparative testing is a bunch of=

crap.  Tech Tip for the flamers:  The professionals who do the testing do=

not get paid for promoting the company's products, this would offend the
boys in marketing and sales.  Flames should be reserved for half baked
opinions (like some of mine) expressed by amateurs.  If a product solves =
a
problem or is superior, it is immaterial who makes it.  When one of our
handful of list professionals offers a solution, the majority of the list=

wants to read it.  If you do not want to read a post or do not agree with=

it, that is what the delete button is for.  Read the Constitution, first
amendment, freedom of delete button!

Climbing off my high horse

Jim Richmond

BTW, does 3m have a product that removes a foot stuck in the mouth?
