Hi,

I've just bought a 91 951 which is in great condition (so far - only
travelled 60 miles so far!). I hoping someone can help...

The glovebox lid has a missing (broken off) hook/catch thingy (the hook of
plastic that goes into the glove box and stops the lid from dropping down.
The parts people here say that a replacement is not available and that I
have to buy a complete new glove box lid (NZ$1700!!!!!). I've taken the lid
off and removed all of the screws in an effort to get the black velour
inside cover off, but it still won't budge - two questions:

(a) is it possible to get a hook without the rest of the lid? If so, where
from??

(b) is there a technique to getting the velour cover off?

The second problem is with the electric seat. The rear up/down switch
works, but the front doesn't. I've unscrewed the switch complex, but the
wires are too short to get it even more than an inch out. So, I haven't
been able to check anything. Any thoughts on the cause of the problem, and
suggestions for the fix? Do I have to take the seat out?? What should I
watch for???

Thanks in advance for the help!!

Cheers, Gary
