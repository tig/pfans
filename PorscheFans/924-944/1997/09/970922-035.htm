There is no bolt there from the factory for adjusting toe. There is a special
eccentric tool placed there to move the arm to and fro on the spring plate to set
toe.

Camber changes in the rear are made by rotating the arm mounting on the spring plate.
Looking at the left side arm, rotating it CCW makes camber more positive, CW more
negative. If you can't get enough CW rotation at the eccentric, you might have to
loosen the two rear-most bolts enough to slide the arm down on the spring plate. This
will have the effect of additional CW rotation and will generate more negative camber.

Even with the car lower than practical you should have no trouble at all getting
-3 degrees in the rear.

            My 86 951 has an intermittent problem with the gauges all
going dead at the same time, this also affects the sun roof operation
and the a/c compressor.  There seems to be no pattern of when it does
this, but it's usually when you turn the key,  The gauges have never
died while driving only on start up.  I have replaced the electrical
part of my ignition switch with a new one, same problem.  I'm an
electronics tech by trade and would suspect a bad ground that feeds all
those areas, but I have no idea where to start. Any help would be
appreciated.

            Thanx,

            Adam Gutierrez 1986 951, Jacksonville, FL
