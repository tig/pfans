I have two 951s.  On is a stock '89 (31k miles).  The other is a '87 modified
car which I autocross and time trial out in the Bay Area.  Generally
speaking, the car is not very competitive for AX, as it is a full weight
vehicle and despite the custom chips (created by Jon Milledge), it still has
a fair amount of lag.  Once in a while we get a big course at Candlestick,
and we can get into the top 5-10 because we have nearly 300 HP.  I wonder why
some of you would "launch your cars" at AX just to get a slightly better
time.  This must be very hard on the cars' drivetrains.  Have you all been
doing it long enough to get a feel for the reliability/maintenance trade-offs
involved?  I'm sure that this adds a significant hidden cost to each AX run.

For my part, I would rather ease my car onto the course, knowing full well
that I am going to have fun, despite being slower than my friends with 914
and 911 race cars.  When we get to the track, I can blow their doors off.  If
I want to win at AX, I'll buy an S2, or better yet, a car like Tom Provasi's
which took top time of day at Parade (ex-IMSA 914-6 on slicks).

In '96 I had clutches installed into both 951s (you should only install the
Sachs HD disc wih the four big springs-- not the current factory part!) and
although I only paid about $400 for the labor (which at 8 hours was a steal
each time), it still was quite expensive altogether.
