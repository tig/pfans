Greg,
You may be referring to a note I posted in response to someone who had a low
#4 reading.  I advised that before assuming anything was radically wrong, he
retest #4 after running the engine for a few minutes to rebuild the oil
pressure in the hydraulic valves lifters (cam followers).  I've had the
experience of them pumping out before getting through all 4 cylinders in a
compression test. I knew something was wrong when the engine started cranking
with great difficulty, even though the plugs were pulled, since the valves
weren't opening.   Ask the shop to simply retest #4 to verify.
As for the readings being generally lower, did they use the same gauge both
times?
Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks.
KevinB
