Today was the last day of infamous turbo rebuild.

There was a hint of nervousness as I sat in the car.  Key in the ignition.  I
had turned the engine over quite a bit without the ignition coil connected.
 Making sure I greased her in all the right places...(you really don't have to
read into this)

I decided to listen to the radio for a little while.  Singing along to the new
Barbie dance song (...you can brush my hair, undress me everywhere...), I tried
not to think about any thing car related...like my back, after removing the car
off the jackstands and working on it from above, I think I destroyed my back.
 Hint: leave the car on the jackstands till your all done.

I turned the key, the engine caught, sputtered, and held.  The loud clack clack
from the cam housing caught my attention.  I cursed George B, the clack clack
gradually went away, I quit cursing.

I went to shut the hood.  The hood wouldn't go down.  I begin to think that
Murphy and Porsche are having tea together somewhere.  I pushed harder on the
hood, it latched, but the passenger side stuck up...what the hell?

I popped it up, I realized I had mounted the power steering resevoir up too
high, duh.

I quickly fixed it and went back in the car.  Vapor was rising from under the
hood, over where the turbo is.  I quickly think that it is some oil that I
spilled over the turbo when I tried to prime it...

I drive, everything runs fine.  There is some noise under the front suspension.
 I think it is the sway bar, I must have not tightened the bolts on to the
bushings tight enough...

Power, the car has tremendous amounts of power.  The past 3 months sitting in
my '87 spectrum hatchback are forgotten.  I stomp on the pedal in second, the
car gets up on the cam and starts loosing traction (I have Yoko A032r on).  The
car bounces up and down as the tires loose grip.  I shift into third and feel
the pull of the car...at 90 I slow down, I decide not to push the car too
hard... yet.


Thanks to all who have helped me get this piece back and running.  Special
thanks to Jim Richmond for sharing the pains of turbo removal.  Made me feel
like I was having a baby or something...
