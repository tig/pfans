These are quartz-discharge headlamps (as fitted to new Porsches, and
some Mercedes, Lincoln, and BMW, among others). They are easily
distinguished by their distinct blue tinge (as opposed to the yellow tinge
of halogens and incandescents. From what I understand by reading a
trade magazine (about the Lincoln), the system consists of more than
just a headlamp unit: there's some special components in there including
some kind of special power supply like a transformer - I think the lights
work on AC, don't know what voltage or frequency (as opposed to the
DC put out by our batteries and alternators). What this boils down to is
that you'd have to find one of these cars in a junkyard and buy the
components off of it (very expensive, I'm sure), and then re-engineer
them into your car. That still doesn't address the issue of the lens, which
are custom designed for each car (BMW, due to the round headlight
shape, would probably be the best bet for a transplant).

I think it would be simpler to just get projector-type driving lights with
the
prismatic lenses. Of course, then you may run the danger of being
mistaken for a Rice-Boy! (I'd personally like to have a set of these, when I
can afford them, due to poorly-lit country roads...)

    I am using 7 inch Hella H-4's, flat lens type in my '86 951. The light
output is great! with the highbeams on you can see for 1/4 mile easy! I paid
$85 for the pair, I bought them from a long time Hella dealer called:
Performance Unlimited Motoring Accsories (PUMA), their phone number is
1-800-35-PUMA, they have always been very helpfull. I use a 80/100wt trade
name "Flusser" Euro/German H-4's bulbs. Recently I bought and tried a New
line of bulbs from Hella/PUMA - called "High Efficency" Bulbs - they are
rated @60/55wts but put out the light output of 100/90wt! While the low beam
performance was better and a white/blue type of light (kind of like a 993
Turbo) I felt the high beam performence was of a lower output and a yellow
type of color light. I probablly would have been happy with these New "Hella
HE" bulbs had I not been using the 80/100wt bulbs, trade name "Flusser"
Euro/German H-4's bulbs. I would reccomend these new Hella HE bulbs coming
from the USA DOT sealed beam headlights.
    

                      Good Luck, Dave Jalali
