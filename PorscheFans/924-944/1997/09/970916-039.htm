customers I have that own them are getting beat to death on repairs." I
mention the problem plastic guide for the cam chain that I've read about =
on
this list  and he says, "Right, but even worse, heads crack all the time.=
 I
have a guy who paid $15k for an S2 that had to spend another $4k before h=
e
could drive it. I don't want you or anybody else to get burnt on an S2. B=
uy
a 944 or a 924S."


Now, I think I've done my homework, checked the FAQ etc., ran through my
archives of the digests I've received and haven't come up with anything
that suggests these problems. What say you all?

I own half of a 89 S2 (rear half).  It has 90,000 miles on it, has the cr=
ap
driven out of it and runs great.  Like any Porsche, things break and are
expensive to fix.  The 16 valve heads are more complicated and hence more=

likely to have major $ repairs than the 8v.   But this is the first I hav=
e
heard of cracking head problems.

If the car checks out, is in great shape and is what you want, buy it.  T=
he
S2 is a superior machine to drive both on the street and track.  You will=

not be disappointed.

I have dumped more money into my 951 than is the annual budget of most
small countries.  I have blown up, broken or removed and reinstalled  jus=
t
about everything on the car.  This said, I would buy another one in a
heartbeat.

Remember, faint heart never won fair princess.  And they are that much
faster!
