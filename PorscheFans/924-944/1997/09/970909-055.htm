Jeez, it was just a recommendation!  Based on his level of experience, I
considered it useful.  It was not meant to be an all conclusive
statement.  Obviously there are hundreds of reasons a belt can go bad
and he did not say this was always the reason, just perhaps a
contributing factor.  I, as well as others I have spoken to, have
mentioned the possibility of some of the mail-order businesses not
having the most up-to date inventory.  I am certain this could happen
from a dealer also.  Believe me, I use mail-order for everything and
avoid the dealers at all cost.  Not trying to be derisive, but you seem
a bit exited.  Sorry you felt the recommendation was of "minimal
assistance".
