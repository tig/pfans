1. location from where you are typing
	Gauteng, South Africa.
2. year and model of car and purchase price in US dollars
	1985 944 N.A. 
	R75000 
 	(assuming the R-$ is about 4.7 to 1 that would be about $15800
 	  but I heard that our earning is roughly the same. ie. someone who
earns
              R2000p.m. here would earn about $2000p.m. in the States)
3. cost of 1US galon of gas in US dollars
	R2.14 per litre.
            ie. $0.46 per litre (sorry- I'm not sure how many litres in
a gallon)
4. cost of 1yr's insurance at basic rate (the rate you'd pay if you
didn't
   have any safe driver's discount)
	When I phoned around I got quotes of around R1000 p.m. ie R12000 p.a.
  	( I am 21 years old )
	Because of a good driving history and a nice insurance company I
eventually got 
  	about R600 p.m. ie. R7200 p.a.
            ( about $1530 p.a.)
5. general hourly labour rate at nearest Porsche shop (dealer or
private)
	R160 per hour (the closest one). But they go up to R250 per hour.
	R160 per hours = $35 per hour.

Keep in mind that we don't earn 4.7 times what you earn, so looking at
it in terms of USD is not completely informative.

	

-I think this could be very interesting, but if someone has already
answered
-and the numbers are similar, don't bother to take up the extra
bandwidth,
-unless it's a completely different area of the world.  I'm especially 
-interested in Asian and European owned cars.
-
-I'll start:
-1. B.C. Canada
-2. 1989 944 Turbo, US$20,000 (purchased in Aug 1996)
-3. US$2/gallon (it's C$0.70/litre)
-4. US$1800 (age of driver does not matter in B.C. at this time)
-5. US$50/hr
-
-I think this will be one of the lower ones.  For those that don't know,
-the answers from some of our European neighbours will drop your jaw!
