Marlon wrote about his brake repalcement problems.

I recently replaced the rear pads and rotors on my '87 951 and ran into
some of the same problems.  How I solved them may not be the most
technically proficent but, it worked.  At the risk of being flamed, here
goes.

1.  Since I was replacing the rotors I needed to remove the calipers.  I
followed the directions from the Haynes manual and the first problem I ra=
n
into was the "wire cross" (didn't look like the Haynes pictures).  After
about ten minutes I figured out how to open them up, though since I was
removing the calipers I don't think this was necessary.  Following the
Haynes manual, I drained some of the brake fluid from the resevior.  I to=
o,
couldn't get the caliper pistons to retract.  (The rotors have lips on th=
e
outer edge from being worn.)  Opened the bleeder, still no luck.  Try
prying the pads back with a screw driver.  You know, the one that know
sports the broken tip.  (I don't care about the pads, nor rotors, because=
 I
am replacing them.  I am (almost) petrified of messing up the caliper or
piston though.  Well coincidently, the opening in the caliper (where the
rotor sits) is large enough to get the claw of a 20oz. hammer in there.  =
I
use the hammer to pry the caliper off of the rotor.  I was careful to app=
ly
the pressure inward on the hammer handle, so that the caliper actually
peeled off of the rotor.  It actually worked amazingly well.

2.  The old pads came out of the calipers with a little bit of persuasion=
=2E =

(Hey guess what, theres little pads on the back of the old pads.  The new=

ones don't have them.)  So I jerk myself around and carefully pry them of=
f.
 Then the little light comes on and I realize why they were there, duh. =

That was a waste of 15 minutes.

3.  The pistons are still sticking out.  I try to push them back in with =
my
hand.  That doesn't work.  (Not like my GPZ750 turbo)  O.K. how much more=

$$$$ can we shell out on a special tool.  $0, that's how much.  There's g=
ot
to be an easier answer.  There is, 200lbs and a 2' piece of strapping woo=
d.
 Not high tech but, it works.  I placed the caliper on its side, on a rag=
,
place the strapping on the pistons that are facing up.  I then slowly,
gently, and evenly, step onto the strapping.  The pistons pop back into t=
he
caliper.  Of course, whatever fluid that is in the caliper squirts all ov=
er
the place.  But the key is, the pistons are back where they belong.  I do=

the other side the same way, gently.

4.  I try to insert the replacement pads into the caliper.  They don't fi=
t
properly.  they appear to be a hair to long.  I guess that's what I get f=
or
buying mail order pads (which I will do for the fronts).  So, after
struggling for about an hour, I said @#%# it.  I took the pads down in th=
e
basement and ground a little off of each end to make them fit.  This
required some time, as I only ground a little bit at a time.  Eventually =
I
got them to fit nicely.  I wonder what the mechanics do?

5.  Removing and installing the rotors is the easiest part of the whole
job.  Porsche did a good job of engineering those little holes so you can=

screw a bolt in to back the rotors off the hub.

6.  Re-assembly was a snap.

7.  I bled the brakes, and they work great!

8.  I am looking forward to doing the fronts soon but, should I replace t=
he
the left control arm, the O2 sensor, or the rear speaker, I blew last wee=
k?
 Which fun and easy project should I pick first?  Probably the O2 sensor
this weekend, because I can't stand the way it makes the engine run.  By
the way, anybody have an answer to my, "which wire attaches to which?"
question?

So Marlon, good luck and get that 951 back on the road and out of your
girlfriend's garage.
