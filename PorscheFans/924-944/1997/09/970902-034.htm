Can anyone explain why it would be considered worthwhile to provide air
conditioning to a glovebox (nevermind in a porsche)?  I recall reading that
when the 928 first appeared this "design feature", along with the
adjustable-height instrument cluster, was a big deal.  Apparently some of
the later 944s were also endowed with this functionality.

Could it be to preserve the chocolate and marzipan invetory so indispensable
while tooling around the suburbs of Stuttgart?  Or to ensure the comfort of
any pets that might live there?  (surely there were optional recirculation
pumps for the taillight aquariums) 

For the record, I am a thoughtful German engineer, but I can't figure this
one out.  Would it be more appropriate to post this on the doodad-gadgetry .
.. . er, I mean 928 list?

If there is a good reason, I will spare no time, effort or expense to make
sure that my car too has all the ducting necessary to ensure adequately
chilled maps and sunglasses.  :)

mystified,
