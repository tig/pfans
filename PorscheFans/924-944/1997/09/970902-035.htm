For one, I hate it when my marzipan melts all over the place.  Seriously,
though, I think it is to preserve cassettes and CD's which may be placed
there, or to keep a sandwich cool.  Considering that a car sits most of
the time, I question the value of this feature, since the glovebox only
receives cooling when the car is used.  Then again, it may have only cost
the factory an extra $1.50 per car to run a little duct up to the box.
