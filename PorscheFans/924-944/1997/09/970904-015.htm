1. Berne, Switzerland
2. '87 951, US$9900 (June '96) w/33kmiles. NO A/C and NO Airbags (wasn't
   standard in Switzerland) but ABS and LSD and el. everything. 
3. US$ 3.20 (if a gallon is 3.8litre, well, 1.25SFr./litre)
4. US$800 third party (depends on cid, hahahahaha), US$600 for fire, theft, 
   approx. US$3500 for collision (didn't had the guts to ask, as my car is to 
   old. It's calculated up from fiancees car as it goes up linear with the 
   newprice of the car + bonus for dangerous cars...)
5. Porsche dealer: US$100
   My friendly VW and Audi dealer: US$55

Parts prices are expensive in Switzerland, as everywhere (for example 
frontbrake pads of a '87 951 US$155, oilfilter US$17, timing and balancebelt 
US$200, Bridgestone S-02 245/45/16 US$360) as we don't have a lot of OEM 
parts and aftermarket partsseller. Then our importer doesn't care about 
cheaper prices for parts, if you drive a Porsche you have to pay for it. 
Guess we have to live with that.

Now lets wait for the crazy insurance costs in UK.

Hope that helps
