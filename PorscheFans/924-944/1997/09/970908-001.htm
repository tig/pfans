  Hey all,
  My '86 has a serious starting problem (I had to take a bus this morning).
  The symptoms:
  - Starting motor runs very slow for few seconds, and the engine starts
  (if it starts) like it's spending all the rest power in the battery
  - Voltmeter indicates little over 13 V when idling - so it shouldn't be
  the battery charger then?
  - When cable emergency starting with my neighbours' car (how
  humiliating), the car starts like an angle - so it's not the starting
  motor?

  I made the conclusion, that it 's the battery. Do you agree? The
  electrical system has been cheched thru for leaks just recently.

  The previous owner told me that the battery has been changed couple of
  years ago. On the other hand he told me, that he used the car for almost
  only his three-mile trip to work - can this use the battery up sooner
  than usual?

  Hoping to be on the road again soon,
  Juha Lipponen
