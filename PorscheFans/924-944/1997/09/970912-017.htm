     I have a 1984 Porsche 944 and just recently the odometer and the trip
     counter both quit working.  This is puzzling to me especially because
     the speedometer is still working correctly.  Could this be something
     simple like a loose wire or a major problem to fix.  
     
     If any one has any information to help me I would greatly appreciate 
     it.
     
     
     Reply:  there is a plastic gear that is reported to break if you try 
     resetting the odo/trip meter will the car is moving.  I retrofitted my 
     82 931 with a go-faster 150MPH speedo and the odo is broken in it.  I 
     have disassembled the slower speedo and intend to try and fix the 
     faster one.  I think it is a doable task but without a second speedo 
     for parts I think it would be a waste of time to take one apart.
