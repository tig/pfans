     Subject: shimmy
     
     Being as I am new to the list and am sure that this subject has been
     discussed at length before I found the list, I will apologise in 
     advance
     for what is probably a stale question.
     I am plagued by a shimmy in my 86 944.  At 60 mph, the steering wheel
     starts ocillating at about 8/sec and the magnitude of the ocillations 
     then
     maxes at about 75 and slowly tapers off after.  I think it is coming 
     from
     the front as I feel it more in the wheel than the seat.  I have had 
     the car
     to the dealer who balanced the wheels and did a full alignment with no
     improvement.  I have taken it to the tire store locally and rebalanced 
     X2
     with no improvement.  The rebalances were in both planes, he said, 
     after I
     explained the wide wheel thing to him and he understood.  This is a 
     very
     vexing and annoying problem and I would be grateful for any advice.  
     TIA,
     jgieske
     
     
     I own a 82 931 and had a similar problem.  I eventually went to a top 
     quality front end place and they recommended new tires.  Fixed mine up 
     very well.
