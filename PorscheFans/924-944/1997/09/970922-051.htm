Hi,
I had some free time a few weeks ago, so decided to install a new set of
ignition wires that I had previously ordered from Magnecor.  The wires
appear to be very good, very soft pure silicone 8.5mm diameter with their
own connector design.  They went on very easily (I have a "lisle" ignition
wire plier set which helped) My old wires were brittle hence the urge/need
to replace them.  No difference in performance though, (I was not expecting
any however) since the old wires did not produce a light show in the dark.
They were very reasonably priced ($65.82 US + shipping) and arrived
promptly.  I have included Magnecor's response to me when I asked for info
on my car (87 951)

>For the 1983-89 944, we use a spark plug connector that is very
>different to to factory one. Our connector fits over that spark plug,
>and seals the hole, but it is a one piece boot that is reasonably
>flexible and is a bit tighter over the spark plug than the factory one,
>so it is a bit more difficult to fit. But, when fitted it works fine.
>Part # 45192.

Magnecor have a web site at http://www.magnecor.com with enough info to
satisfy anybody's thirst for things "ignition" 

Usual disclaimer - no interest, just satisfied with their product.
