Standard tire/wheel setups from factory:

'88 Turbo		front	205/55VR16 on cast 7Jx16 (52.3mm offset)
		rear	225/50VR16 on cast 8Jx16 (52.3mm offset)
'88 Turbo S	front	225/50VR16 on forged 7Jx16(65mm offset)
		rear	245/45VR16 on forged 9Jx16(60mm offset)

Remember, that in buying a used car, any original factory equipment
remaining is speculative, at best.  Also, even though you cannot
differentiate between plain and "S" as far as the VIN (chassis) number
goes, you can tell an "S" by its engine number(as I just recently posted a
little while ago - 220hp engines begin with 45J, and 247hp "S" engines
begin with 47J).  The original "S" models did have the distinctive exterior
and interior combination (silver rose metallic paint/grey & burgundy plaid
cloth interior), but during the latter half of the production year, they
began producing "S" models in standard colors, when they ran out of the
220hp engines.  However, the list of options should be stated on the small
paper placard inside the spare tire well.  On the original Turbo S limited
editions, the "S" package (M758 - $5298.00) included the following:
	Larger Turbocharger
	Sport Chassis (M030)
	ABS (M593)
	Limited Slip Differential (M220)
	All Cloth Seats
	Cloth Door Panels (M526)
	Full Power Seats
	Split Rear Seats (M685)
	Rear Window Wiper (M425)
	Headlight Washers (M288)
	Protective Side Moldings (M418)
	Hi Fi Sound System (M490)
	Special Interior

Hope this helps some more
