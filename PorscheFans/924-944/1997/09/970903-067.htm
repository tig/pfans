Hi, Kevin,

According to the '88 944 Turbo S Service Information booklet, part # WKD
495 021,

"Installation of reinforcement plates between both side members on left
and right sides and the wheel housings gives the body shell additional
strength.  This in turn meant the following changes in the engine area: 
water hose to expansion tank, water hose to water pump in turbocharger
cooling circuit, mount for ignition coil."

This info, along with photographs, is on page 5-01.

One is located just ahead of the PS fluid reservoir and under the
headlight motor and the other one is under the lower expansion tank
hose.
