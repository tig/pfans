Injectors usually make a chic, chic, chic, type noise.  Lifters tend to make
more of a clak, clak, clak noise that usually resonates around the head area.

Hmmmm.  You could easily be leaking oil from the rear cam housing seal, or from
any of the front cam housing seals.  You might want to look at the back of the
housing to check on that seal, if it is leaking, it is relatively easy to fix.

The front cam housing seals can be fixed also.  If the cam shaft seal is
leaking, the oil usually drips from underneath the large waterpump hose. (the
funny shaped one).  The other seals will leak between the areas where the front
piece mounts to the housing.
