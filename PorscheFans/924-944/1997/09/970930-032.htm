I bought my 1987 944 black/black for $5k.  Actually the owner
wanted $7,950, but I had a mechanic look at it, and I took the
estimate to them and asked if they'd subtract it from the
price of the car.  The car had been sitting in a garage for
like 3 years, with only an occasional outting, so some of
the wires in the dash were faulty, and needed to be fixed,
and a rack&pinion.  Anyways, the car runs very nicely, and
has 64k miles on it when I bought it...

	Only upkeep I've had since was an oil change..
