Hansman gave us a good description to find the actual chips inside the
brain box and to open and part the cirquit boards. Now, some people may
think that this is extraordinary tricky stuff, and there are some small
things to think about here:

When opening the brain box, be careful. Current automotive hardware is
not sensitive to static electric discharges and handling errors, but the
older they are, the greater the risk. And, of course, the battery should
be disconnected.      

The chips are ROM's (Read Only Memory) capsules, that usually contain 
data for the on board computer to use. Basically, what is changed is
mapping of timing and mixture to revolutions, and in Turbos also the
wastegate. No updates are done to the actual processing part of the
computer, and no updates are done to the I/O modules - and there is no 
need for that either. But if you have a DME error, new chips will NOT
fix that.       

Before you remove any old chips, remember that you may want to reinsert
the original ones some time in the future. Therefore, take a good look
at the chips, and make a note of A: markings and B: wich way the little
hollow dot on the chip's 'roof' is pointed. Usually there is a similar
marker on the socket, but to avoid any later confusion, make a sketch. I
recommend to keep that sketch/note together with the original chips. 

Removing the chips is best done with a special tool, but a thin flat
screwdriver will do nicely. Just make sure that the chips are taken out
squarely and do not bend exessively. Take a good look to make sure that
all legs are intact, and if a leg is broken, remove it from the socket
with a needle nose plier or similar (but this happens very seldom,
usually only if the leg was repaired - but more about that later...)  

Now, installing the new chips seem to be straightforward, but do not
haste. First, check that all legs are straight and true, and that they
fit the socket perfectly. Any leg out of line can be carefully aligned.
Let the chips sit in their foam block, or in their plastic tube until
it's time to mount them.

Then double (or triple) check that the chip is in the right orientation 
and that no legs are outside of their socket. Then, push the chip down
carefully until it is seated. Make sure that all legs are into their
designated socket and if anyone is bent, you have to do it all over.

Mishaps that can happen (and have): Aligning the chip so that left- or
rightmost pins are out of the socket, putting them in backwards, mixing
them up, bending one (or more) pins, breaking pins when bending them
back and even breaking the chip itself.

While I am certainly not advocating making unauthorized copies, there is
no harm to make a spare chipset for oneself. According to general
computer practice, backup copies of data for your own safety purposes
are always allowed, and making a copy of the ROM chip is very easy to
do, if you have a friend with a ROM programmer. Something may happen to
your DME, and if it goes down it may take the chips along... A spare set
may come in handy here.              

If disaster strikes...

A broken leg (pin) can be repaired (a new pin is soldered to the stump) 
A cracked chip may (surprisingly!) work as the substrate is mechanically
stron, but it is no longer sealed, and will fail in a short time. It has
to be replaced. Any serious chip vendor will accept to replace a
mechanically damaged chip for a small handling fee, as the actual raw
material is about 10 dollars.  

If the car does not work after the change, and you cannot find any
obvious fault, you'll be glad that you were careful with the original
chips, and know exactly how they should be reinserted...

Happy chipping!
