I don't think it's worth having a professional install 4x6 rear speakers 
in your car.  I put 4x6 Polks all around in my car, and added a 10"
enclosed woofer in the back, and the result was a system which had
very little upper bass.  I had the same head unit and amp in another 
car with 6 1/2" drivers in the front, and it had a lot of punch.
I didn't put in a cross-over, but I don't think it would have helped 
much. Those little 4x6 drivers just can't pump out a lot of sound.

What I would suggest is to first talk to the shop and ask them what 
they think would be the best setup.   Ask them what they think about
adding custom speaker pods in the front to hold larger drivers, or 
putting bass/midrange drivers in the two rear corner compartments.  
If you're worried about cutting up your car, then buy a spare compartment 
cover and save the original. 

BTW, you can install the rears without having to completely remove the 
panel by sticking a very thin flatblade screwdriver through the speaker 
grille holes to access the phillips head speaker mounting screws.  By 
removing a few of the panel screws, you can stick your hand back there 
to guide the screwdriver and pull out the speaker.
