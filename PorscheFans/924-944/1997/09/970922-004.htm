Sounds like the climate control relay which controls the heater valve which is 
located above the clutch bell housing. Your climate control system controls 
this relay. It is normal for it to click when heat is being enabled or 
disabled, but if it is clicking rapidly you probably have a problem with your 
climate control system such as a faulty temperature sensor or dirty 
temperature selector potentiometer. Next time you hear the clicking, try 
turning the temperature control knob to the hottest setting and see if the 
clicking stops. Other than having to replace my heater flap bearing, I have 
not had to diagnose any problems with my climate control system, so perhaps 
someone else on this list can be of more assistance.

Good Luck,
  Ezra
