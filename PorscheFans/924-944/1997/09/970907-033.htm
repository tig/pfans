Torque is 90 Ft Lbs I am told.  I usually go around at 50 Ft Lbs and then 
again to get them to 90.

Next time don't open the valves on the caliper, the fluid will be forced 
back into the resavoir, just make sure that it is not completely full and 
put a rag over it so that it won't squirt the underside of your hood with 
fluid.

If it is not an S model it will be bolts, and S will have allen screws.  If 
it is indeed a bolt get a 1/2 inch drive six point socket (a good brand) 
and a long breaker bar or cheater of some sort.  These things are tight! 
 Some wd-40 could not hurt but be careful what you spray it on.

The minimum rotor thickness specs are stamped in it.  They do seem to still 
have alot of metal even when they are gone...could be a conservative wear 
number???

I used a large screwdriver getting leverage against areas the would not be 
seriously damaged.  You can also use some channel locks and the outside of 
the caliper if you put something on the caliper to protect it (wood or hard 
rubber).

If you have an S model the front pads are larger otherwise I think they are 
the same but I am not positive.
