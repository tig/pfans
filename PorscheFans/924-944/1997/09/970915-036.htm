The comparatively sluggish low-end performance of the 951 has been written
about in nearly every road test, so there's nothing wrong with your
car--that's just the characterictic of the model.  If you want to dump the
clutch and light up the tires, the 951 will lay down some impressive times,
but it's not the kind of thing you want to do all the time.  I once beat a
brand new FWD Jetta III across an intersection--which, frankly, I didn't
think I could do.  My favorite tactic now is to get right alongside someone
you want to beat across an intersection or on a freeway on-ramp, then
slowly inch up like you're going to take off when the light changes.  It's
real obnoxious, I know, but I don't do it all the time.  When the light
does change, more often than not the other guy takes off like a bat outta
hell (like you're challenging his manhood or something) and I just slip in
behind.  Sorry for the rambling.  A chip will probably not solve first-gear
acceleration and that sluggish low-end, but you will be able to pull longer
and harder in every other gear.  The performance of my chipped 86 is
virtually unchanged from stock at the lower end of the performance
scale--in around-town driving it never gets out of second gear.  Where I
really notice the chip is on a long straight or out on the open highway.

"Car and Driver" did a test of a 951S some years back, but the gear ratios
had all been changed from stock, with the result that the car laid down
mid-5-sec 0-60 times, but topped out at only about 137 or so.  That's also
an option, but an expensive one.

Drive the car stock before you chip, and decide ultimately what it is you
want from it.  Even in stock form it should still handily outperform 90% of
the cars you're likely to encounter on public roads.

'86 951

>Hi, fellow water-pumper fans.
>        I recently purchased an '89 951 to replace a non-turbo, 1983 944.
>While the new beast is quite exhilerating to drive (and the post-85 1/2 A/C
>is definitely an improvement in a tropical climate), I have a question
>about low-end performance.
>        My 1983, with lower gearing, had more around-town tractability, and
>much of my driving is in mixed-city traffic. The Turbo seems to have a
>tendency to wallow if I am inattentive with my shifting, and want to be
>driven at higher rpms to keep its response sprightly. I also read in
>Excellence that it is imperitive to drive the car in a low enough gear
>(they say rpm > 1500, which is AWFULLY low) that oil pressure is kept high
>for the turbocharger and other parts.
>        One porsheophile suggested chipping the car to improve its
>performance at the low RPM range. Is this a good idea? What would be the
>pros/cons of this move?
>
>Thanks,
