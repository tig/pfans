The hole is next to the TDC and rev sensors.  If you look at the sensors from
the driver's side, (leaning over the fender) the hole is directly above the
sensors.  The hole is a small rectangle, with a metal marker, the marker goes
over the line that is above the OT on the fly wheel.

Are you sure your at TDC on the engine?  Find that out, your camshaft could be
off by a tooth.  In general, everything aproximately lines up.  Do to the
length of the belts (they sometimes stretch a little) someone might not be able
to exactly line them up.  If you don't notice any odd vibrations, it is
probably okay.  But first find TDC with the flywheel.

The idler pulley should be .5 mm away from the balance shaft pulley.  Turn is
counter-clockwise.  The idler pully seems to touch the upper portion of the
belt regardless how you set it.  I'm pretty sure this is where the hideous
whining comes from on these cars.
