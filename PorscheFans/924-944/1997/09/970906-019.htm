I am considering undertaking the subject conversion since I unfortunately
experienced the 944S cam chain tensioner failure that broke the tensioner
mount off my S head.

1. Anyone done this conversion before that can offer any advice?  I am
getting the complete engine, exhaust manifold, intake manifold, air flow
sensor, oxygen sensor, catalytic conveter, DME, wiring harness, &
bellhousing/clutch pack. 

2. I need the air cleaner / intake plastic parts upflow from the air flow
sensor since those were broken in the wreck of the S2.  Anyone have these
parts?  Anyone know of good/better alternatives to stock?   Will I have any
problem fitting the stock S2 air cleaner under the sheet metal cowling
(between the front of the hood and the bumper) on my 87 944S?  Some have
recommended using a K&N universal conical bolt on.  I was thinking of
mounting this under the cowling where cool air could be taken in.

3. I have also heard I will need the S2 accelerator cable since the S2
throttle valve is further forward then the 944S.  Anyone have one?

4. I hear the S2 has the same cam chain tensioner as the S.  I have heard
of failures as early as 30K miles.  Therefore, I'll be changing this
ensiner every 30K miles, as I found out the hard way the S cam chain
tensioner should be changed?  Any other experiences advice on this?

5.  While the engines out, any recommended parts/work I should complete on
the 89 944 S2 engine to save future expensive repairs/labor?  The cam &
balance shaft belts, idlers and tensioner rollers and cam & balance shaft
seals were recently changed.  I am planning to pull the bellhousing,
replace the rear main seal and inspect clutch.  I  hve heard some have
problems with broken clutch release arms. Any advice or experiences to
share? 

I appreciate you time and input/advice.
