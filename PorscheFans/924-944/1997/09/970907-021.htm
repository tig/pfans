Is this the infamuous belt whine which changes with RPM?  Apparantly with 
the balance shaft belt set to 2.7 on the gauge, the whine will be 
present. The 944 FAQ states resetting the tension to 3.0 or 3.2 will reduce 
the noise.

My car makes this noise, and I HATE it.  When I go back for the 1000 mile 
retension, I will ask the shop to try those settings.  The car was quiet 
with the old belts, but the balance shaft belt was fairly loose and floppy 
when I went in for the replacement.

 -Gregor  944 2.7.. the coyote with a sore tooth.
