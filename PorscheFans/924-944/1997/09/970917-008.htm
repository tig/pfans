I went through a similar process about 2 months ago with my 85-1/2
944.  My A/C compressor broke it's mount and needed to be replaced.  I
finally went with the Sanden conversion, but bought it from Vertex.
The cost was $289 for the conversion kit, plus ~$40 for a new
receiver/dryer that I decided to put in at the same time.  Conversion
kit includes new compressor/clutch, belt, adapter bracket, and some
hoses and fittings.  My mechanic didn't seem to have too much trouble
doing the job, though he said he had to cut and re-use some of the old
hoses to make everything connect up.

Things to watch for - the belt supplied with the conversion has fewer
ribs than the original belt (it's not as wide).  You have to be
careful to get the belt lined up on the grooves between the compressor
and other accessories.  You also have to _really_ tighten it up to get
it not to squeel.  Second, you have to hack-saw off the lower
(un-used) mounting lug on the Sanden unit. If you don't, it presses
against the sway bar and makes a noticable vibrating noise.  This may
not be noticed when the car is jacked up, so look when it's on the
ground.

Otherwise, I'm fairly pleased with the conversion - the A/C is really
cold now!  Time will tell on the longevity of the unit.  But I figured
for just a few dollars more than the cheapest rebuilt/used units, I
could get a brand new compressor.  That seemed like a safer bet than a
rebuilt or used one.

Good luck.
