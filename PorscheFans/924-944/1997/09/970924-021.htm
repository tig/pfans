I'd want to know why the warning light is on.  Perhaps you were fooling
around under the dash and accidentally jarred some connector loose?  Or
could some sensor have failed?  My 968 doesn't turn on the warning light
because the battery has been disconnected/reconnected.  I would take it to
a dealer or a shop that has a 9288 Systemtester and have the fault memory
read out.  The tester also can be used to erase the fault memory.  (I have
one of these gadgets - if you are passing by the SW corner of Pennsylvania
you are welcome to stop by and use it.)
