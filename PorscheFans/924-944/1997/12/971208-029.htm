To Porsche ->FANS<-

A problem with a forum like this one is that it can easily reflect just =
the negative side of owning our cars. Sometimes, it is quite depressing =
to read about the sheer variety of possible problems that we can =
experience.

Well, I have no problems with my car just now. The idling is fixed, the =
shock absorbers are new, as are the tyres, the engine seems to be =
pulling as hard as it ever has, and is using less oil now I am using =
Castrol 5W60 synthetic.

Even better, last weekend I went for an absolutely terrific drive (even =
the rain didn=92t spoil it). From here in North Wales, I drove down =
through the Welsh/English borderlands to Hay-on-Wye. After the first 20 =
miles or so, the roads are tight and twisty, even by UK standards. There =
are few straights - just enough to allow passing of the few other slow =
vehicles on the roads. Instead, bend follows bend, rise follows dip, =
visibility constantly changes from wide open to just a few metres. =
Camber is unpredictable, and many of the bends are blind.

On roads such as these, if reasonable progress is to be made, accurate =
car positioning is essential. A lorry may pass going the other way with =
much less than a metre of clearance on either side. An accidental drift =
across the centre line can be very bad news. Good brakes and good =
stability under braking do more for encouraging progress than does extra =
power. Often, a bend will turn out to be tighter than expected, with a =
sharp check of speed being needed. Worse, someone comes the other way =
using more road than is rightly theirs. Then, brakes and steering must =
work together if a collision is to be avoided. When a straight does =
appear, power must be on hand immediately to overtake a slow vehicle. =
Flailing around with the gear lever and waiting for the turbo to run up =
are unwelcome distractions.

My 85 NA 944 fits the bill just about perfectly. The extra punch of the =
turbo would not be of much use in these conditions - for much of the =
time, the roads are too tight for even the power of the NA car. The =
extra torque of an S2 would be welcome, although a little bit more care =
would be required in low gears in the wet.

I don=92t think that I would enjoy a 911, because it is not such a good =
car in which to deal with the unexpected. My old BMW M535i was much =
faster in a straight line, but would be hopeless on these roads - too =
vague and far to ready to wag its tail. Lotus Elise or Elan may be =
better in theory, but would be hard pressed to carry two peoples=92 =
luggage, walking gear, and so forth for a long weekend. A Caterham would =
probably be much quicker, but would be no fun in the rain, and all of =
the luggage would have had to been sent on by post. Even heading into =
fantasy land - consider any Ferrari, and you have to conclude that it is =
just too wide for these narrow roads. Of all of them, I would feel =
safest in the 944 in the event of an accident.

Having said all that, maybe either of the current duo on offer from =
Porsche would tempt me (offers, anyone ;-)

So, there it is. A car in which I can have fun, and which serves as 22+k =
mile-a-year transport, with few hassles. This is my second, and I=92ll =
have another - I must have covered about 75k miles in these cars by now, =
and they still don=92t bore me. In any company, I think that any 944 =
must be thought of as a very good car. When value for money is also =
taken into account, I think that they are just about unbeatable.=20

Alistair

(Who will, no doubt, be back grumbling with a vengeance in a few =
weeks=92 time when his gas toggle flange is leaking or his fuel grommet =
adjustment has dropped off.)
