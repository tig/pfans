Most likely you have a bad connection at either the throttle switch (TPS,
on the throttle body) or the airflow meter. Disconnect these, clean them
well with contact cleaner and/or a wire brush, and reconnect.

This is a very common problem, especially on '89 models, for some reason.
Mine does this when the humidity is high and the car hasn't been driven for
a while. I usually pull over, disconnect and reconnect the throttle switch
connector, and then start it back up--problem disappears.

Good luck.

twin balancer shafts (patented by Mitsubishi) they could produce a large
in-line four cylinder engine that would run as smoothly as a V-6. <<

At the risk of getting flamed, (like I really care) I have to disagree with
Mr. Flecher here. The 944 was always slotted for entry level by Porsche, and
was never intended to "outshine" it's 6 and 8 cylinder brothers.  With the
company coffers drained from developing (during a time when the company
fortunes were not in good shape) the flagship 928, any thought about designing
a complete new engine for the 944 was never given serious consideration.  

In fact, the development work on a 4 cylinder derivative of the 928 V-8 was
initiated concurrently with the original development of the engine.  As
followers of  Porsche history know, clean sheet engine development is a once a
decade undertaking, even in the best of times.   

You countinue in error when you state that: 

One of the considerations that
influenced the final decision was the space available in the engine
compartment (i.e. the 924 engine bay would not require significant
changes).  

The single design consideration was the maximum utilization of existing
watercooled engine tooling.  The 924-944 engine bay was not a factor. As most
924-944 buffs know, it is very easy to drop a V-6 or V-8 in this car, no
cutting of the engine compartment required.  

IF Porsche had been given the budget for a completely new engine, and IF the
original chassis limited engine design options, that certainly would not have
prevented the resourceful Porsche-Peich engineers from limiting engine
choices--look at the excellent Volkwagen VR6 engine.     

On the subject of disconnecting balance shafts on 944's/951's. Here is what I
know:  The balance shafts account for a maximum of 5 horsepower parasitic loss
(on an ENGINE dyno, a chassis dyno won't even show a change). 
Removing or disconnecting the balance shafts have resulted in: cracked oil
pump pickups, oil pressure sender failures, exhaust manifold/system cracking,
engine mount failure, even heard of loosening con-rod nuts (hard to believe
that one).

Lots of club racers pull the shafts off altogether. They make plates that
replace the balance shaft covers, and they also tap the balance shaft bearing
oil feed and screw in a Allen plug.  The fastest shaftless 944's I saw at the
Road America TRAC '97 all seemed to run drysumps as well, so they may have
pulled the shafts to makeup for the power loss from the belt driven oil pump.
On the 951, the oiling for the turbo is not affected by the actual rotation of
the balance shaft. You can pull the belt, but if you take the shaft completely
out, you will not oil the turbo.  

IMHO, the balance shafts add a lot a durablity to the engine and should not be
removed. Even in racing, it never  comes down to 5 horsepower, but on driving
ablity and finishing.

Happy New Year,
