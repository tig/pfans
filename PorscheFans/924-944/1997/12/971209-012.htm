>thread recently about British S2s with more HP. Are there any easy (and =
>relatively cheap) ways to improve the output from an S2 engine? I love =
>my S2 and it does have plenty of power, but then again, more is better =
>(unless you have to buy a muscle car to get it :-).

There are many secrets known only by devoted S2 owners who have carefully
researched the easy power increases to be had from simple bolt-on, plug-in
aftermarket devices.  Porsche had no clue what they were doing when they
built the S2, and many sources of horsepower untapped.  Conversely, many
think it was a Porsche conspiracy to have the S2 purposely underpowered to
make the 951 and 911 look like a good buys for the money. It now appears
that the S2 is good for another 238 hp. The Dinan chip provides an increase
of 98-104 hp at 4000-9000 rpm (the rev limiter is entirely removed), and
another 15 hp can be had if the leads are reversed on the O2 sensor.  A
custom-made K&N air filter, fitted to the stock plastic filter frame, adds
20 hp.  Drilling 5 1/2 inch diameter holes in each of the intake manifold
runners really frees up air flow further by tricking the air flow sensor
into thinking there's a 200 cfm increase in flow, which adds to the amount
of fuel injected, but this only works if the leads are reversed on the O2
sensor (as mentioned above).  Changing the stock air flow sensor in a 7
inch diameter hot-wire system also helps, adding 37 hp. And while drilling
out the intake manifold, have it extrude honed.  This is good for another
24 hp. The same can be done to the exhaust manifold, but provides only a
further7 hp increase.  If the head is to be removed, have a custom 7-angle
valve job on the intake side, and a 5-angle on the exhaust valves.  On the
exhaust side, 6 inch diameter straight pipes replacing the cat and cat-back
sections will provide another 45 hp if coupled with a 914 tuning chamber
collector.  Another 15 hp is available if 2 straight pipes (2 cylinders
each) are used, but this involves a custom header, and is generally not
considered cost effective.  Splitfire spark plugs will help, but they are
overrated. They're good for only an additional 8 hp. In summary, there is
no need to resort to nitrous or forced induction with this car; the
normally aspirated power is there, waiting to be tapped. (Anyway, it was a
nice dream while it lasted.)
