Dear Joe:
        My '83 944 (104,000 Oahu, Hawaii miles; read LOTS of clutch cycles)
developed fatigue cracks behind the clutch master, too. Symptoms were I
started hearing creaking noises under the dash when I depressed the clutch.
On inspection, I discovered fatigue cracks radiating from the clutch master
mounting bolts. I had the firewall welded but can't comment on the
longevity of the fix because the car was totalled within a few months of
the repair.
        As far as other maintanence, I replaced the clutch (blown rubber
center), rear shocks and bearings, clutch master, brake master, alternator,
and the usual belts and waterpump. The car handled flawlessly (P.O. had put
in a new steering rack at 80k; car had M030 options).  The engine was in
very good shape at 104K miles  (did not use a drop of oil in 6 months) and
currently is in the shop at Air Cooled Engines, Honolulu, waiting for a new
owner, if anyone is in need.
        Maybe Luis could comment on the price he paid to fix the firewall
and how the welding was done. I could check my old records to see how much
I paid for the welding, but don't recall it being a huge expense.  (Still
can't bear to part with the old records, and the hood emblem still graces
the wall of my office).
