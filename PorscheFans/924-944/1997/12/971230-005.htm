I raced one (latest version Impala / Caprice in my 924S on 31 north of Indy
two years ago.  It topped out at under 140mph, barely, and I was running
maxed out at 143.  Suspect gearing or a speed limiter built into the
electronics...  I doubt the cop version has this problem of an electronic
speed limiter, if indeed this is a speed limiter and not just the max speed
of the package.  The car is massive, must weigh 4k pounds.

....I was tooling around in my (x) around (x) when one of these froopy
numbers just blazed on past me, star drive barely ticking over.  A few
seconds later it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta.
Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow.

You can see them gliding along the roads.  Long, wide, jet black,
foreboding, and sometimes fleeting.  Like some tall stranger dressed in
black drifting in to town, not hostile in their manners, but not
bolstering a friendly air either.  Their insignia is a little obscure as
well.  However, upon closer inspection you see Impala, yes, that's Chevy
to you...
....I never been challenged by one, but it would be nice to know what the
potential of those monsters are.
