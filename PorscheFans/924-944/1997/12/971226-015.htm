Dear Porsche consultants:
I just discovered that my '78 924 leaks coolant like a sieve from what =
appears to be the engine block just behind and above the alternator.  =
When I bought the car, I found what resembled a freeze plug (appears to =
be made of brass) laying on the fender well.  I hoped I was wrong but =
based upon my experience today when I was refilling the radiator with =
coolant, I think I must have been right.  Any advice from the collective =
wisdom on how to proceed?  Assuming it is a freeze plug I will need to =
replace, can that job be performed with the engine in the car, or, do I =
need to plan to raise the block?  Thanks for your advice over the past =
several months!!

Happy Holidays
Robert Allen
