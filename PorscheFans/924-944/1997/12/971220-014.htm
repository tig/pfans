Hey y'all,

I am new to the list and have been reading with interest the various
postings, and have learned a great deal thus far.  Having purchased an '84
944 this last summer, I anticipate I will be learning a lot more... and
hopefully not with my wallet!  I apologize for a rather lengthy post, but
any advice I can get will be appreciated.

I picked up a very staight car with indeterminant mileage (odometer is
broken..speedo works), various electrical problems and a fairly tired
interior, but it running fairly well otherwise.  The previous owner had
receipts for a new clutch/timing belt/altenator.  I paid almost nothing for
it, so I wasn't overly worried about the risk, and having wanted a Porsche
nearly all my adult life, I figured why not? (Don't flame me!!! It was VERY
cheap).  I am somewhat mechanically inclined (I own a Harley... it comes
with the territory) and was thinking it would be fun to play with.

So far, I have gone thru the brakes (new rotors/pads) and they are now fine
with the exception of a short in the pad wear indicator that I haven't been
able to find yet (I installed new sensors). The aforementioned speedo is
coming out of the car and going to be rebuilt.  The tach works
intermittently, and so I am planning on replacing it (if anyone has one they
want to get rid of, contact me...).  I also paid to have the timing belt
tensioned, since I had no tensioner tool, and I had them go thru the car on
a general basis.  They said that there were no problems to be worried about
overall, with the exception of a whine coming from the transmission, and
their suggestion was to drive it until it breaks.

"Drive it until it breaks"???  Uh, sounds like bad advice to me...  I have
done a bit of reading on the subject and am currently thinking it is the
ring and pinion going out.  I am guessing that it is beyond the scope of my
abilities to tackle that one, and will be going to a more reputable shop to
have this problem looked at.

I had also had them look at a stumble when the car is accelerating.  From a
stop up to cruising speed, the car would hesitate or miss a bit.   They felt
it was an air/fuel mixture problem, which (imagine this), they failed to
fix.  I was thinking possibly fuel filter/injector problem or possibly
something clutch related, but they said the injectors checked out.  I am
going to replace the fuel filter (and the "net" before the fuel filter as
mentioned in todays post) just to be sure.

Prior to taking the car in to have the belts tensioned, it was completely
drip free.  After getting it back, it was leaking both antifreeze and oil.
I returned the car to them, and they said that the antifeeze was caused by
both the waterpump ("changing the tension on the belt caused that to start",
according to them) and the radiator.  I should mention that they also
changed the coolant temp sensor while they had it.  The oil leak was coming
from the cam cover.

I am thinking that I will have all the oil seals replaced, along with the
belts and the waterpump, so that I can have a fresh start on this,  and I
will be taking the car to a different shop, unless someone convinces me to
buy the tensioning gage and do it myself.  Any suggestions as to reputuable
shops in the Minneapolis area would be welcome.  The shop I went to was
supposedly reputable, but at this point, I have very little faith in them. I
will post the name of the shop here, if anyone is interested, but I don't
want to unfairly slam anyone.

Anyway... next post will be shorter!  I promise.  Merry Christmas!
