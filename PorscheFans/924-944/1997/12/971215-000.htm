To the man with the chevy inspiration-	
	No offense, but lets get a few things straight. Porsche+Chevy=porschev.
This combo has been done before(I have been witness to it).The end results
are not that awe inspiring. The front end is 3 times as heavy as it once
was, the perfect balence is no longer there, suspension geometry is changed
so much for the worst, you will take corners with the grace and stability
of a wounded Rhino on a mud bank.
Do you really want this? A Porsche is for lack of better words "Flawed
perfection" (well most of 'em anyway). When you take  the magic away, you
are left with nutin!
Granted, you will win the stoplight gran prix, and you will have plenty of
torque on demand, but the motor is far less entertaining then a quick
spooling 4 banger. Trust an e-mail aquatinance... keep the magic in the
marque.

If you are not aware of the Aase bros (www.AAsebros.com) yet, they offer
used but good parts cheap. 2.3 acres of nothing but a tired german cemetary
for our beloved marques. Turbo's are also there in great #'s(read manifolds
and heads). I just pray that on my biannual pilgramage home from College,
they will have the BIG sway bars I lust after.
AS far as those ball joints are concerned, if you have an early car(83-85)
they are eas to get. Try vertex in Florida, your local veedub shop (perish
the thought) or even Pep Boys (who I work for). If they are of the later
years, well, you are in a world of hurt and give automotion a call. You
need to replace the whole arm with the joint (for about 300$ parts)
And finally those shocks are always a pain to buy, I have had good
experiences with believe it or not KYB gas a just. They are very economical
and ride almost...hard, like a used set of Bilsten. Try 'em, my best friend
Camaro hated 'em at Sears!But pput money into the tires, you truly get what
you pay for. Brand name, v-rated and wide sizes.AHHHHHHH, such lovely
traction.

Just my two (thousand) cents
