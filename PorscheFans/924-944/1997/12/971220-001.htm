You obviously must work on your car yourself.  If you have used mechanics
in the past, you would know that there are quite a few morons out there.
Like the idiot that installed my balance shaft assembly 180 degrees out
of phase on my Talon, then said the exhaust was causing the vibration,
or the moron that forgot to re-connect my batter on my Talon and it
stalled as I was making a left turn in a busy intersection, or how about
the mechanic that called me a twit after dumping C$9000 in his shop in
a span of 8 months.  For what reason you ask?  Because I was tired of
waiting for my car to be done 4 days after it was promised!  Or how about
my "best" Talon mechanic who had my car for 3 months to do a re-ring
and head gasket.

I don't have time to work on my car, nor do I have the proper resources
to do most items (space, tools, etc.), so when I bought my Porsche, I made
sure that there were at least two good shops around that I can use.  So
far, I've been very happy with my No.1 choice.  These were the dudes
that sent me a set of wheels when I was stuck at the Mall when it snowed
last year.  If I had called my Talon mechanic with a desperate plea like
that, he would've laughed until New Year's Day.
