Just a note to all on the list...I think the list is a very good
sounding board...I personally have picked up some tips from the insight
of many of you "non professional mechanic" Porsche owners.  Keep the
ideas coming.

My spare time is very limited to answer all of the questions I get very
thoroughly, but I will try to respond to each request as best as I can. 
We will try to offer parts to list members on a trial period for 20%
over cost when correct part numbers are supplied, plus shipping, and see
what type of response we get.  Many of you should order the Parts and
Technical Reference Catalog from Porsche (PN# PNA 000 147 A) and that
will help alot. 

I usually check my e-mail in the mornings and then in the afternoon, or
I can be reached at (817)332-6547.

Best wishes to all...Merry Christmas and have a safe New Year
