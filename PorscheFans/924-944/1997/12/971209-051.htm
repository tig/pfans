Hi,

Well, my son just popped for about a $1000 worth of stereo upgrades for
his '89 Turbo.  Last year he put in a nice Sony CD head unit and used =
that
to drive the stock 10-speaker Hi-Fi Sound System.  Wasn't bad, but after
all these years, the stock speakers weren't the best and the 4x15W wasn't
exactly overpowering.

So, on Monday a pair of Diamond 5-1/4 2-way separates were installed
(model M355), along with a Sound Stream 300SX 2-channel amp of 50Wx2 RMS.

The Diamonds fit perfectly in place of the stock woofer, and the small
midrange was eliminated and covered with a plate.  The amp went in the
left rear cubby-hole and the wires were all run along the stock harness
run.  The rear speakers remain powered by the Sony.

It all looks completely stock from the outside... but the difference is
like night and day.  The sound is great!  MUCH improved dynamic response
and great imaging.  He's now thinking of the next  year's step, which
would be a pair of 6-1/2" Diamonds for the rear quarter, along with
another 2-channel amp.  With that setup there shouldn't be any need for a
sub-woofer.
