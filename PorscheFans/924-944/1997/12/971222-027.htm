That part is readily available from the dealer for about $7 or $8.

Good Luck!

> Hi all,
> 
> I'm writing to describe a problem with the driver's side power window on
> an  '89 944na.  Last week, out of nowhere, the power window started
> making a loud click when the window reached the fully raised position.
> When I pulled the door panel off I found that the "window regulator
> stop" (the mechanic's term for it) had failed.  This is a little piece
> of metal about 2" by 1" that's not quite rectangular, with a plastic
> insert where the power window arm seems to come to a rest to prevent
> over-tightening.  Somehow the metallic portion of this piece appears to
> have fatigued and broken, leading to my loud click
> 
> In any event, the piece unbolts and the power window works fine without
> it (no clicking), I just have to be careful to let go of the switch so
> the gear doesn't keep winding.  I don't know where to find a new part,
> though, without big bucks for a new power window mechanism.  I don't
> want to buy all that to replace what should be a $5 part.
> 
> Has this happened to anyone else?  Any ideas on where to find the part
> (a junkyard seems the most likely answer)?  Thanks.
