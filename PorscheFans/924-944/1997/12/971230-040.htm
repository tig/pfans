But do the intake manifold, cylinder head, valves and exhaust all run at max
capacity from the factory? (I don't know anything about the technical stuff
here, I just report what I feel when I press the pedal..)

Oh yes it was for the better. Even if it didn't increase the overall power
of the engine (I have no way of testing this), it sure increased power at
low RPMs. Like I said, I have an automatic and the increase in power, if
only at the bottom of the scale, is very noticeable and _very_ welcome.

I did test it with a stopwatch, and the difference before/after the K&N and
Weber was about 1 second from 0 to 60mph if my memory serves and my
stopwatch didn't flip out on me. Measurements like these are to be taken
with a huge grain of salt, but the car sure wasn't slower nor does it feel
slower. Anyway, like I said - even if the only thing it did was shift the
torque curve it was still a very worthwile improvement which I don't regret.
