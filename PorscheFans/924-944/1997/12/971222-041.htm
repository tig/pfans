Steve,
	I have Powerhaus's K27-6 (installed by PO) I had it chipped (Autothority
custom) and it is recommended that it be a custom chip since the cfm is
much higher than the K-26 and will run too lean if you use the Autothority
chip for the stock turbo.  I am reasonably satisfied with it, however, it
has significantly more turbo lag than the K26 stock (also chipped) that my
brother has.  Therefore, I would recommend the lighter turbo K27-6dr since
this should shorten lag.  Autothority's prices are a bit on the high side
but their service and support are good, in my experience.
