I had a set of '86 951 Fuchs refinished by Robert Wood (when he was still in
charge, and now runs Wheel Enhancement) after a car wash guy ate the
anodizing off with an acid wheel cleaner. They were a real mess when I sent
them in and looked absolutely perfect when returned. Honest, there was no
way to tell them from brand new. The only problem I had was they said 3-4
weeks and it took over 2 months with lots of promises for "next week" along
the way.

Having not found a supplier in my vicinity, I opted not to go with the much
touted Bridgestone RE71. I traded over to Michelin's XGTV in size 225/60/15
and am curious to ask whether this size has the capacity to rub. While not on
the car yet, I do not want to make an error on the sacrifice of my fresh
fenders. Does anyone have any knowledge of tire sizes and redommend brands for
the 83-85 944's on the 15 inch cookie cutter? Thanks in advance
