It surprises me that people will take out their balance shaft belts and
then just run the car as if nothing needs to be done.  In the Talon camp,
the majority of the racers remove the balance shaft assembly and belts,
they even have a kit sold for it (the 944's use Mitsubishi technology in
their system that is the same as the Talons).  The one key thing that is
for some reason being forgotten is that once you take the belts off and
remove the assembly, you MUST balance the engine.  I would expect a Porsche
engine to be fairly close to a "blueprinted" engine, but hey, why not do
it at the same time.  1/4 mile increases are 2mph for the Talon by removing
the balance shaft so it has the same effect as adding 20hp to that car,
pretty significant gain.

Just another note from my past :)
