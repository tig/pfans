Wayne,	
     My 951 exhibited the same symptoms when water got into the DME via a
small hole in the battery tray when it rained. Unfortunately, I didn't
become aware of the battery tray problem until it was too late. It happened
about 4 or 5 times over a 6 month period before the DME finally fried. The
first few times it happened, after the brain had a chance to dry out, the
car would run fine. 
     If it wasn't wet outside when your symptoms occurred, then I might
suspect the DME relay. When the DME relays start to fail, the car has a
tendency to be difficult to start when it sits for about 10 to 20 minutes
after operating at normal temperature. It will normally start if the car is
warm and you attempt an immediate restart. Also, if the car sits and has a
chance to cool (45 minutes or so) it will start fine. Don't ask me what's
so magical about the 10 to 20 period but, I've seen the same thing on three
different cars. Let me know what you find.

Good Luck and Happy Holidays,
Clark Fletcher
