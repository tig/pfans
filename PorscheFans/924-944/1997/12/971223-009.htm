Personally, I think it's great of Chris to volunteer his home as a base
for the Porschefan's ski party.  Chris is a hellofaguy and I'm sure
we'll respect his home accordingly (who's bringing the keg?).   :)

Just teasing you Chris, I do love to snow ski...it's that putting the
Porsche in the garage for the winter stuff I'm not so sure about.  By
the way, 80 degrees here today.  It's tough I tell you.  Of course a
little snow for Christmas would be nice...but I'll have to jet ski or
ride the motorcycle instead.  Snow skiing is planned for February.  :) 
Woohooo!!
