For that outrageous sum (Automotion would want to charge at least $79.98)
you'll need to refine the concept a bit. You could include enough wood for
10 pad changes, and include the "special" screwdriver.  Or move up to a
more high-tech material (lucite, urethane?) that could be color coordinated
for black or red calipers.  For the Big Reds, you could charge an extra $10
because people with red calipers want the exclusivity.  Does "Part-a-Pad"
sound too hokey?
