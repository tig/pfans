Mine does the same. Don't recall if it had anything to do with the pump
replacement. However, I have been able to help things out in the past by
re-bleeding the cooling system a few days after messing with it. Now all
I need to do is replace that durned fan relay, which just conked out a
few days ago.

While we're talking about cooling systems, anybody want to tell me if
they are getting a little coolant leakage from under the bleeder bolt?
The washer is there and in good shape, so I'm assuming it's either the
bolt or the housing it's on...

Alex.
'84 944, sorely needs paint. PO Maaco'd it.
