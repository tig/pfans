     Guys,
     
     Regarding the recent thread on hiring Porsches. Anyone in the UK can 
     look in various car magazines there are quite a few companies that 
     will hire Porsches and other sports cars by the day or by the week. If 
     you can get these mags in the states then look for 'Car', 'Autocar', 
     'Top gear'.
     
     Also if you can access the web try www.bespokes.co.uk/main.html
     
     If anyone wants phone numbers for these companies please drop me a 
     line to Steve.P.Cox@unilever.com
     
     I'm not sure how these companies will view taking the car from the UK 
     to Europe I imagine they won't have a problem if you mention it when 
     you book. Just don't mention the 'ring.
     
     On another note: Steve, Ezra don't worry I haven't forgotten about the 
     seats. Get back to you as soon as I can.
     
     Hope you all had a good christmas. Happy New Year to you all.
     
     Rgds,
     
     Steve.
