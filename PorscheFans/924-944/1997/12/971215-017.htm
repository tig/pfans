     I am a new owner of a 89' 944n/a with 77k miles. I have had the car 
     for four months and have enjoyed the car. 
     
     This weekend a very strange noise appeared. It sounds like it is on 
     the left rear tire. It is a clicking sound which must be located at 
     the center of the radius of the tire due to its frequency. At very low 
     speeds it goes click click and at higher speed click click click click 
     (same timeframe). At high speeds it cant even be heard. My guess is 
     that it is the CV joint or the bearing. Could it be the balance shaft?
     
     Also on the same day I lent the car to my girlfriend and when she was 
     finished with it the driver side door lever would not open the door. 
     The only way to get it open was to open from inside via pasenger side. 
     I removed the panle and looked around comparing it with the passenger 
     side mechanism. Magically it began to work again. I dont feel good 
     about it and wont be suprised if it unfixes itself. About the only 
     thing I could tell for sure is that the pasenger side lever engages 
     before the driver side does. Any ideas? 
     
     Please advise me on my plight.
