which is exactly the same as your analogy of jacking up a car, which
will of course result in decreasing negative camber. However lifting a
car by the wheels and lifting it by the frame are nowhere near similar.
Try putting a couple of jacks under the wheels and lift, and see what
happens to the camber! That is the correct analogy to increasing
pressure in a shock absorber, and will lead to increased negative
camber.
