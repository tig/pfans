Nick, you must be deadly on April 1st.   But seriously , what if you
crawled under the car and peeked up into the bell housing and just
happened to see that little reference stud with the allen head. Lets
supose we had a drill and tap handy and we moved that stud, oh say.....
5 degrees in the advance direction. Of course if we did this, we`d be
sure to wear safety goggles when drilling so the "chips" don`t fall in
our eyes (pardon the pun). And we would also want to make sure that the
assembled height of the stud in its new location is the same as before.
Wouldn`t this have the effect of advancing the entire timing map 5
degrees? I think so! Naturally we would have to run the good gas, but it
is a small price to pay for 15 "free" horsepower. There, now  we`ve all
saved $300. by doing mechanically exactly what the chip does
electronically. I`ve got a couple more tricks if your interested , but I
better stop now or I`m going to start sounding like one of Nick`s
dreams.       Dave C.    Vancouver, Canada.
