I agree with Barry.  Tom is doing the right thing by changing belts now.  
I like George Beuselinck's comment he made to me about changing the 16 
Valve chain tensioner, "it's like resetting the clock on the ticking time 
bomb".

It is easy to get caught up in discussions on the exact life span of 
timing belts and how to maximize their life and thus get the most miles 
per dollar.  Many of you remember the long discussions we had about oil 
change intervals.  Should we change every 3,000 miles or 15,000 miles for 
better economy?

Let's get a life.  You can have paralysis analysis if you keep at it.  
Soon the miles will tick by and then, oops, valves and pistons try to 
occupy the same space-time coordinates and so goes economy out the 
window.  Then again, you will know just how far that belt can go before a 
failure.

Changing timing belts and oil are cheap insurance compared to the 
consequences.

Post Script:

Remember, ticking time bomb has an up counter instead of counting down to 
zero.
