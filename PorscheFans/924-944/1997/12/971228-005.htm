I can't say that this would work, but there has been a similar product out
on the streets for quite a while for carb'd Harleys, and I have talked to a
few guys that swear it makes a difference (this should in no way be
considered an endorsment... I haven't tried it, and don't honestly know).
Personally, I would think that being creative with some light metal and a
pair of tin snips could probably achieve the same result, if you wanted to
try it.  Since the idea is to get the air swirling, I would guess that it
would have a similar on injected models, as well as carbs, but I am rather
suspicious of the phenomenal HP increases as claimed.  There is no free
lunch, and the laws of physics haven't changed THAT much since our cars were
designed.

Here's a thought.... if this works, why wouldn't a small, powered fan
inserted in the air flow work even better?  Oh, wait....  that would be a
951, right?

By the way, thanks for all the input and advice that I have received from
list members.  It is much appreciated.
