Ho, Ho oww!  (easy on that sternum, jocko!!)
jeez it hurts just to laugh, not to mention blowing the nose or
makin' love. . .methinks I dont like this pain after a wreck thing. 8{}

Anyway,
I've emerged from my totaled 84 944 na and looked in the
sunday paper and saw a black 88 944S with 71K miles
asking $10.9K for it.  Ad sez all scv records and new '6000'
tires. . .hmm deelicious, newtritious.
Is this reasonable?  Seems a bit high.

If memory serves, these later year models had an oil-fed
cambelt tensioner and socketed DME map prom.
The 'S' implies stiffer suspension, bigger brakes and
<mouth watering> 4 valve/cyl 2.5 or 3.0 L ? engine/Normal Aspirated.
Does this year model also have airbags? (kyle's sternum asks)

Some kind soul suggested I get a turbo, but  I'm not as well-heeled as some
of you guys and I cant do the R&R turbo every now and then. . .maybe next 
car.
In truth, I would probably be easy enough on the car, the running gear would 

just wear out from extended use over time.  I'm not the racing type, I just 
use
my Porsches to get me around town in style.  All those extra brakes, etc 
would not
have helped in that pileup last week. . .I was in the wrong place at the 
wrong
time.  Six seconds to first impact. . . . .#!!!  . . .##!!!!  . . . .#!  . 
..#!!

What we all really need to survive this hard-ball game with vans, pickups 
and
suburbans is P-car bumpers that are equal in height.  Only problem is, our 
cars
would resemble econo-tanks more than Porsche's.  In studying the photos of
my crashed '44 -both bumpers are still good!!  Her body metal took the brunt
of the impacts front and rear.  The full size dodge van I rear-ended -I 
couldnt
tell where my car hit it, but you can on 44 where it made contact.  I had a 
near
full tank of fuel, after getting whacked in the tail three good times, I'm 
surprised
the tank didnt rupture, but considering that most of the impact was above 
the
rear deck. . .the tank didnt spill a drop.

Thanks for listening.

not a high bumper in the bunch..
