Anyone done a cam chain replacement on a 16V 87 944S. Have read that
these are sometimes prone to premature failure. Any word on how
difficult they would be to replace? Any special tools?
Thanks!

I've had "clunking" problems w/ the rear brakes.  I think it's just the brake
pad moving around.  I don't think that's detrimental, but it can't help!

I currently have a front end kind of a cross between a "clunking" and a
"groaning" sound.  It started out where I'ld have to be going over a bump
slowly while turning hard to make it do it, and even then I couldn't always
make it reoccur.  Now I can cause it to occur on demand by either breaking
real hard or by jerking the wheel far to one side or another.  I'm about to
try tightening every bolt I can find, and will post any results.  While I'm
down there, I'll also be checking the front height adjustable coil-over kit I
just installed.  The clunk-groan noise was there prior to installing the kit.
One of the reason's I got the kit was to eliminate the upper strutmounts as a
possibility.  They are eliminated.  My money is on the stearing rack mount.
