Hi, Peter,

It sounds like your rear main seal is leaking.  If that is the case, you
may want to wait until clutch replacement time to fix it, because you
have to do the same amount of work to get to the seal as you would to
replace the clutch.

I see you got your answer from George B.  A guy on the Racing list is selling
a set of 16" Fuchs which may fit your car. I don't have his address handy, but
I'll forward it to you later.
