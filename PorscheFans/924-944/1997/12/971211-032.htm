Hi, Mark, Roxanne, and all,

I posted my theory about this problem about a year ago, but I haven't
yet tested it by purchasing the required new parts.  The following is
the message that I originally posted.

"I'd like to add that at the bottom of the inside of each latch is a
hollow-cone-shaped 
piece of hard rubber that the post on the hatch fits into.  My guess is
that this piece 
serves two purposes.  First, it keeps the post good and tight inside the
latch and 
second, it pops the post up enough upon opening to clear the latching
mechanism.  I 
bought my '88 Turbo S about a year ago and while trying to find out why
the hatch was 
difficult to open, I discovered that these rubber pieces had
deteriorated and cracked 
into several pieces.  The right latch refuses to let go without manually
lifting.  I 
believe that this, along with tired hatch "shocks", is my problem.  This
may also 
be related to the squeaking hatch problem on some cars.  After taking
care of a couple 
of more important (i.e. expensive) repairs, I'll replace the latches and
shocks and 
report my results."

Maybe sometime soon (if I don't sell it first), I'll be able to get the
parts and find out if this fixes the problem.  I hope this helps.

<< Don't even think about it.  If you want loud get a Borla >>

Yea, but like he said, it's  a heck of a lot cheaper.  You can get a glass
pack for about 1/15 the price of a borla.  I probably only replied to this
because I'm probably going to use one to replace my muffler which is rotting.
I'll probably get a borla tip for it though!
