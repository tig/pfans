Craig,

>Any recommendations on 944 books?  I too have been disappointed with the=

>incompleteness or gross technical inaccuracies of most books,
>including Mr. Batchelor's. I would like one that covers the S2, and mayb=
e
>even the 968.

I have a lot of books covering the 4 cylinder Porsches, but none of them
earns the status of a watercooled bible.
Best technical descriptions can be found in PCA's "UpFixin der Porsche"
books (Pano articles) and in the Excellence issues. (Both very good sourc=
es)

As you already have discovered, most books technical data is reduced to
the tech specs as you can find them in every car test and very rough
descriptions. (5 gears, ventilated front brakes! Wow!)

A very nice book -because of the REAL GREAT photos- is
"Porsche 968; Sparrow/Kessel." (Ok, probably not what you are looking for=
)

>Incidentally, I have The Porsche Book by Lothar Boschen and Juergen
>Barth, which is excellent, but in was last updated in 1982 (or is there =
a
>new version?).

Yes. My version of "Das grosse Buch der Porsche Typen; Boschen, Barth" is=
 the
2nd edition printed in 1994 and so covers the 944 S2 as well as the 968 i=
n it's
various variants (CS, Turbo S, Turbo RS). Contents aren't that technical
but offer a nice overview (73 pages for the 944/968) which includes a tab=
le
showing all four bangers from 82-93 incl. serial numbers, car weight, hp,=

torque and weight. (Distinguished between US and RdW cars)
Neither gearing tables nor any part numbers are shown in this book.
