 If'n it was me, I'd opt for a full trailer - especially since you already
have a capable tow vehicle.  That's why I've had a tandem car trailer for
the last 12 years.
However, the last time I did a "long" haul was in 1986 when I took my '74
Carrera to the Porsche Parade in Portland, Maine.  I had no problems going
out there, but had a slight mishap on the return to Chicago - spent the
night in Cleveland and when I went out at 7:15 in the morning to get some
clothes, there was only a small pile of glass fragments on the ground, and
no tow vehicle, trailer, or Carrera.  Someone broke into the tow vehicle
and drove the whole package off, with only the stripped tow vehicle being
recovered a couple of days later.  Never heard of the Carrera or trailer
again.
Soooo, a little advice for the trip, no matter which method you use - be
careful where you park and always use some type of alarm or disabling
method for both vehicles, or sleep in the truck, or don't sleep at all (two
people driving non-stop is the best way, but, unfortunately, I didn't have
this option).

Good Luck and have a safe trip
