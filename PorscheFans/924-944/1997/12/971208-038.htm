Since someone was asking about chips for their 968 I thought I'd join in =
and ask a similar question regarding the S2s. Does anyone have any =
experience with chips for these cars? You seldom see them advertised and =
I believe that I have heard people say that it is almost impossible to =
improve the performance of the S2s. On the other hand, there was a =
thread recently about British S2s with more HP. Are there any easy (and =
relatively cheap) ways to improve the output from an S2 engine? I love =
my S2 and it does have plenty of power, but then again, more is better =
(unless you have to buy a muscle car to get it :-).

TIA,

\ Henrik Frank,
Newport Beach, CA where we are drying out from this weekends flooding.
