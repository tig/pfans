Carl,

   Yes the stock 924S clutch has the rubber disk in the middle.  I've been 
told that this was to soften the feel of the clutch when engaging and to 
reduce stress on the ring-and-pinion gears in the tranny.  You can install 
an updated version of the clutch that has a metal arrangement in the 
pressure plate, which is sometimes listed as a performance clutch.  These 
generally are a little more expensive.  I decided to stay with stock 
stuff. 

   I just had the clutch replaced in my son's '87 924S.  While I was at it 
I also had the rear main seal replaced.  You might as well while you're in 
there.  I got all of my parts from Don McGill Porsche/Imports in Houston, 
Tx.  They had the cheapest prices around for the complete stock clutch 
package.  I don't have the individual prices, but here's what I bought and 
what I paid:

Complete Porsche Sachs Clutch, pressure plate, all of the bearings( 
throw-out bearing, needle bearings, etc. - everything needed to completely 
replace the clutch except for the flywheel), rear main seals, front seal 
package for the cam belt tensioner stuff, new cam belt, Porsche stock car 
cover for the 924S (with Porsche crest on the front, storage bag, and 
cable/lock -$~80) ---- all for $600, including express shipping($54).  I 
believe their clutch package by itself was about $350. I had a dealer, 
Reeves Porsche in Tampa, do the installation, since their labor rates 
seemed to actually be less than some of the local independents, and..... I 
trust them to do it right. I believe labor for the clutch job alone was 
about $450, which I didn't think was bad considering the amount of work 
involved. Everything I had done, clutch, seals front/rear, cam belt, etc. 
was around $1100 labor.

Someone who's replaced their rubber-disked 924S/944 clutch with one of the 
other ones should be able to tell you what the difference feels like.  All 
I can tell you is that my son's car is very comfortable to drive now.  All 
of the parts from McGill were Porsche-on-the-box stuff.  I don't have Don 
McGill's number on me, but you should be able to get it from directory 
assistance, or in the Excellence magazine. That's the only place I've seen 
them advertise.
