Surly, you can find wrecked Turbo cars with good drive trains and 
suspensions for under $5,000.

However, it may be less work to fix the car than swap engine, torque 
tube, transaxle, wiring harness, fuse box, clutch, shifter linkage, 
flywheel, DMEs, radiator, hoses, pipes, expansion tank, turbo coolant 
pump, intercooler, waste gate, exhaust manifold, turbo, catalytic 
converter, muffler, instrument cluster, spindles, calipers, hubs, disks, 
air filter box, oil cooler, CV joints, assorted heat shields, intake 
manifold, throttle body, accelerator cable...
