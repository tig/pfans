I feel the reason the CV joints on my car have been trouble-free is that
every time I'm under there I give the boots a good 'squishing' to work the
grease around inside.  Makes sense to me!

Ros,
Because of the age and the lack of regular use, you have to consider anything
made of rubber to be suspect, and I would consider it necessary to replace all
belts as a preventive maintenance item, they likely need it anyway. Any new
owner of a 924S-944 should replace balance and timing belts for the same
reason  unless they have been done recently with records to prove it. Coolant
hoses can be inspected within reason without replacement, as can cv joint
boots, steering rack boots, etc. One possible source of trouble from a car
that sees little use is corrosion in the combustion chambers, not normally a
problem on this porsche since it has aluminum cylinders, but if the rings
picked up a bit of rust over the course of a year, it could cause trouble.
Easily checked out via compression test. If the car is automatic, there is a
rubber driveline disc which is prone to drying and cracking, if its a manual
the rubber centered clutch can fail for the same reason. Both involve some
money, but you have to face that with any of these cars at any age. If you are
paying a premium for low mileage, try to verify the mileage. Less than 30K
miles and it should have original tires. The brake pedal rubber cover should
look close to new with no worn down corners. Research and contact all previous
owners back to the original purchaser. If you cannot do this, it may not be
worth much  of a premium. This car should not be more than about $6.5K
regardless, in my opinion, because the resale value is not great on the 924S,
though I like mine fine. It is quite a bit finer than plain old 924. Good
luck.

Sorry if this is redundant, but I think the list was down this morning, so I
will repost it. 
I'm thinking of adding cruise control to my 87 924S. If anyone out there is
parting out a 924S or early version 944 which has the factory system, I would
need all of the components, which are:
The brain unit, located behind the stereo
The control unit, located in front of the battery, with cable to gas pedal.
The turn signal/cruise control switch. 
The car appears to be prewired for this, including mounting points. It must
have been a dealer installable option and does not appear very difficult to
deal with. If you have this stuff on hand, let me know what you would sell the
whole package for.
