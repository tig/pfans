The 89' Turbo and Turbo S also has a baffle to help prevent oil from
sloshing away from the pickup and causing engine damage during high G
maneuvers. Have you test driven this 'S' yet? Is there actually a
noticable improvement in acceleration? The figures state that the 247 HP
88' Turbo S and all 89 Turbos 0-60 about .5 seconds faster than their
older 217 HP siblings. However, the stock KKK K26-8 turbocharger found
in the 247 HP models spools slower than the KKK K26-6 found in the 217
HP models, which means the extra 30 HP comes at a price in turbo lag.

Just something to think about,

Christopher Barry

87' 951 (zermatt silver on beige) awesome ride
80' 924 (white on beige) ready to drive to the junk yard....
