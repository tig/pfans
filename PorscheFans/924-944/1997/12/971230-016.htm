In response to Steve Russakov:

Many people believe that the 944 was developed as an entry level vehicle.
Although the 944 eventually did become Porsche's entry level vehicle, it
was originally intended to bridge the price gap between Porsche's
supposedly new flagship vehicle (the 928) and the 924. Porsche intended for
the 924 to continue as its "entry level" vehicle. That's why they continued
production of the 924 for six years after the 944 was introduced.  When the
public lost interest in the 924 and the line was discontinued, only then
did the 944 become Porsche's entry level vehicle.  Additionally, many
Porschephiles believed that it would be the 944 Turbo instead of the 928
that would eventually replace the 911.

Another common misconception is that the 944 engine is simply a 928 engine
cut in half. This stems mainly from the fact that the 944s use the same
cylinder head and valves as the 928.  The early 928 engines were 4.5L.  If
the 944 was simply a 928 engine cut in half, as so many believe, the 944
would have been a 2.25L instead of a 2.5L. If Porsche did start developing
an in-line four around the same time as the 928 engine,  it was intended to
replace the Audi engine in the 924 (since the inception of the 944 project
was 6 years away).  Again, if the 944 was to replace the 924 as Porsche's
"entry level" vehicle, why did they continue to produce the 924 for six
years after the introduction of the 944  (including the introduction of the
924S)?  Although, there are similarities between 928 and 944 engine,  there
are too many differences to deny that  the 944 engine was a new design.
Using proven design concepts and components from other models is not
uncommon among car manufacturers - particularly Porsche.  It is certainly
not restricted to the 928 and 944.  Heck,  the Volkswagen Beetle engine and
the 911 engine have more in common than the 928 and the 944.

As Rob Holmes stated, Porsche did consider using a V-6 in the 944. The test
results from an experimental 924 fitted with a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo V-6
during the development of the 944 caused Porsche to seriously consider
using a V-6 (in all probability a 928 engine minus two cylinders).  If
Porsche developed the in-line four with the intention of putting it in a
new model,  why did they experiment a V-6? Although a V-6 does fit easily
into the engine bay of 924/944, using a V-6 powerplant would have required
re-engineering the layout of the engine compartment (not required when
using an in-line four similar to the 924).  The  prospect of developing an
in-line four cylinder engine that could produce the smoothness and power of
a V-6 was obviously very appealing. The fact that the 944 could be produced
without changing the 924 production line (as Rob mentioned) made the final
decision a "no brainer".
