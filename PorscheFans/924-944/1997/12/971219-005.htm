That's correct.

No, not more torque, your torque wrench works the same if you use
anti-seize or not.

That's it, if you use anti-seize you will put more stress on your stud
compared to a dry bolt applying the same amount of torque. Therefore it
gets more stretched, but it should not get distorted more than usual I
suppose.

Hmm. I'm not shure that should happen if your stud was in proper con-
dition. I would suppose that every designer of cars should know that
it's almost impossible to have really dry threads at repairs. Therefore
one should think that you should be well inside the limits of your stud
using anti-seize like copper-paste which is not that greasy.
