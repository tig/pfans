The Question Was...

From: mmatthew <mmatthew@utk.edu>
To: 924-944@PorscheFans.com
Subject: new to the list...and considering a porsche....

Eventually wrecked my rx7 turbo. :)

Now I'm looking at a new car, and have narrowed it down to two choices.
an 86 944 turbo with 75k miles on it..... Second choice is an 89 rx7 turbo.

Well... my .02 worth.

I was a big RX7 fan for more than 10 years. Owned a '79 and then an '86. The
'79 was a great autocross car and totally dominated C-Stock for many years.
That is unless a great driver in a well prepared 914 2.0 showed up. I loved
the Mazda and had great success with it finishing as high as 6th at the Solo
II Nationals.

For the last 6 years I've become a big 951 (944 Turbo) fan and have owned an
'86, an '89 and now an '88 Turbo S. Several years ago while I owned the '86
I stopped by a Mazda dealership to test drive the latest generation RX7. We
took it out and around town it felt pretty fast. 1st and 2nd pulled fairly
strong, but it really didn't feel as quick as my Porsche. Then we went onto
the highway. Wow... the RX7 was so slow from 60 to 80 and 80 to 100 I was
convinced something was wrong with this particular car. It didn't matter
which gear you were in it was just a dog compared with my '86. In fact, the
saleperson took me out in a different car, but it had the same performance.

Last summer when cruising around Detroit a guy in his 3rd Generation RX7
decided to challenge my '88 Turbo S with APE Stage II. Needless to say it
wasn't even close. I would pull 6-8 car lengths from 60 to 100 mph in fourth
gear.

When it comes to handling, although the RX7 is quite nice, I don't feel it
is in the same league as the Porsche. The biggest difference in my mind is
the steering feel... the only Japanese car to ever come close to what the
Germans produce quite easily is the NSX. Oh, I would say the RX7 might be
next in line, but try it yourself first.

Reliability... well although I agree with the other points made on the list
about the rotary's longevity vs the 944, I've more than paid for my '88
Turbo S again in repairs on my three Turbo's over the past 4 years.  Sure,
drivers schools and 35K miles a year plus my affliction with perfection are
part of those costs. But the 951 is NOT as reliable and will be much more
expense to own it in the long run.

I would say comparing the RX7 to the 951 is kinda like buying wine, or a
computer, or carpeting, or really most anything. But then we've all heard it
before.... "You get what you pay for."  The 951 would be my choice. Drive
them first though, then you decide.
