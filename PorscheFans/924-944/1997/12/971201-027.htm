<3. Just got a chip from George B. on consignment and it seems to
help. The car seems to rev mor freely and has greater torque throuhout the
power curve. I don't know about the top end. This is a very subjective
judgment and it's possible there's no difference but the difference I wish
there would be. Is there a place in south Florida where I could get the car
dynoed?>

I recall seeing an article in Grassroots Motorsorts (quickly becoming one of
my favorite rags) within the past year that talked about dyno testing in
South Florida.  I couldn't find the issue, but maybe you can, or someone on
the list can point you to it.  Alternatively, you could call their offices.
 They are in Ormond Beach.
