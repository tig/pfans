Hi all,

Recently I have noticed a stumble and a loss of power in my '89 951 upon
hard acceleration (more than 75% throttle.)  Sometimes it pull perfectly
with full power (I love this car!) but sometimes it seems like it misses,
like the FI is screwed up somehow (I hate this car!) Basically, it feels
like the turbo never kicks in.

I have also noticed (a few months back) that it will occasionally hunt at
idle speed. Occasionally revs would hang around 1800 for a while before
coming down, and sometimes it would idle at 1000 and then up to 1800 and
slowly back down. That problem doesn't seem to happen much any more, perhaps
because it is colder here.

Finally, the transition from barely open throttle to closed throttle (and
vice versa) seems a bit jerky.  Kinda like a motorcycle with slop in the
drivetrain and throttle control. Makes driving in traffic a bit uncomfortable.

Does anybody know what this all means?  I suspect perhaps the throttle
switch is the culprit in the last problem, but could it cause the others as
well?  Any other suggestions?  Any words of experience on how to test the
throttle switch?

Thanks, 
Tim
