Mark,
The line with the Banjo Bolt actually goes straight to the cycling valve.
There are two other vacuum/pressure lines attached to the cycling valve.  One
goes to the intake boot infront of the turbo as a bypass.  The other goes to
the wastegate diaphram.  There is a spring and a pressure actuated diapgram
that control the wastegate.  There is an electrical lead from the cylcling
valve to the KLR (the other computer next to the DME)  There is also a
vacuum/pressure line from the intake manifold to the KLR.  This vacuum line is
located between the #3 and #4 intake runners (or is it #1/#2?)  Anyway,
between the rear to.  This vacuum line splits and goes to the fuel pressure
regulator, the KLR, and another one somewhere else.

The point being, the modified banjo bolt lowers the pressure that the
wastegate diaphram sees through the cycling valve, and not the boost level
that the KLR sees in the manifold. I TEE'd off of the line to the KLR for my
boost gauge.  I've heard that it's best to pull directly from the intake
manifold.
