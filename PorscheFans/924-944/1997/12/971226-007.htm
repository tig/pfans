....that drive ya crazy.=20

1. Does anyone know how to 'de-humidify gauges? The weather here in FL =
has been pretty soggy lately and now my gauges resemble a rain forest. I =
never could get the gauges on my 924 to dry out. (Tried pulling the lens =
cover plug and running the defroster on high to try and bake it out) Now =
my 85 944 has the same annoying problem and the plug appears to be =
'non-removable'.
2. Headlight adjustments- I need to 'aim my beams' accurately and I'm =
tired of tweaking. I may need to set the mechanical stops on the =
headlight as well as the beam adjustments themselves. (Any one know the =
son of a @!#$% at Haynes that decides when to print 'this adjustment =
should be made only at an authorized service facility....'?) I'd like to =
send him a Christmas card or two.

Thanks in advance.
