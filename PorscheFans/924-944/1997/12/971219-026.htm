Dave,
ok so its not as bad as I feared

I did indeed look under the belt cover last night and was relieved to
not see any oil on the belts. However I only peered in from above as I
didn't get the cover all the way off. Am about to make the plunge for
the holy grail of Porsche tools as I'm due for a retension and already
decided at next belt change to do h2o pump and balance seals...so this
may be done sooner than next scheduled belt change.

So tell me after I get belts, sprockets, etc. etc. off and I assume
rear belt cover how do you get at the front crank seal if that indeed
is leaking? Is it accessible once all the stuff in the way is removed
and just pries off?
