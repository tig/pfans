This is a good price.  I recently replaced my old Blau
Monterey with a Becker Mexico 2340 and matching CD player.
(The CR-201 is called the Grand Prix.)  They are *wonderful*
radios but not well known for their aftermarket line.  Check out:

	- http://www.beckerautosound.com
	- http://www.becker.de
	- http://www.continentalimports.com (*)

The Becker is the first radio I've seen that I *had* to have
for my 944.  They have a lot of higher-end audiophile features.
Some of the things I like, about the Mexico, are:

	- European styling (matches the car better than original!)
	- CD changer interfacing directly at low-level
	- 4-channel amplifiers (4x20 watts)
	- Preamp outputs for external amps
	- Dolby B and C
	- Detachable front panel and security codes
	- Speed controlled volume
	- Shortwave reception (Mexico model only) (**)

and lots more.  It would take quite a long posting to list all
of the features.  The Grand Prix/CR-210 has RDS - the Mexico
does not.  There is also a version of the Grand Prix which
substitutes an in-dash CD player for the cassette player.

The CD changer plugs in the back.  It is a low-level interface
so no FM modulator is needed.  Becker has 6 and 10 CD changers
available.  I bought the 6 CD changer.  Mechanically it is a
Sony changer and uses Sony magazines.  You can give CDs titles
and it will remember them.  (I don't know how many titles it can
hold, but other CD changers will typically hold about 100.)

The main downside of the Beckers are a bit of a learning curve.
Operating the unit is easy, but a little unconventional.  The other
downside is that the MW AM tuning only tunes up to 1600 khz.  It does
not cover the new expanded frequencies which go to 1700 khz.
(Even though it would be a trivial EPROM change, Becker seems
unwilling to change the frequency limits.)

The Blaupunkt Monterey that came with my car is rated something
like 2x8 watts output.  It isn't a great radio.  And the 4x6"
Blaupunkt whizzer cone speakers are also pretty dreadful.

(*) Scott Brotherton at Continental Imports (see web site above)
was a big help to me.  If you order a Grand Prix he can also
get the Porsche CR-210 face plates.  (I have no association 
with them other than being a satisfied customer.)

(**) If you get a Mexico and have a car with an in-glass antenna,
shortwave reception will suck.  Email me for details on different
approaches to this problem.  (For shortwave buffs: The unit is
single conversion, 455 khz IF, with about a 6 khz bandwidth.
It is general coverage from 5900 khz to 15700 khz in 1 khz steps.
You can tune either by up/down tuning, direct frequency entry,
10 SW presets, scanning, or searching.  Scanning and searching
are in 5 khz steps and within the SW broadcast bands only.  No BFO.)
