Hello everybody and 'THE GOMBERG FAMILY';
In your message:0023 you reported that after removing the O2-Sensor your
car is running smooth. Well the basic function of the O2-Sensor is to
monitor the oxygen content of the exhaust gas and it works producing a
voltage output signal which aids the control unit in the determination
process of a correct air/fuel mixture ratio thus controlling the pulse of
the fuel injectors. All systems working correctly and a closed loop
situation is met. Various factors may have a negative effect on this sensor
and when they do the car performance is affected (stumbling, missing, wacki
iddling and so on). It is obvious that this sensor serves a definitive
purpose but in tone with your message I would like to report that after
suffering all the previously mentioned symptoms in my car, I removed the
O2-Sensor and nearly five years later the car's still running superb. It
would be prudent to mention the fact that I removed most of the factory
exhaust system and am currently using a header, no O2, no problem. The
air/fuel mixture may not be the best one or the recommended one but like I
said before the performance is great and there has not been any noticeable
changes with my fuel mileage. I am familiar with the nagative effects in
the event of a state required emission test failure so I kept the original
exhaust just in case. Like I always say, all this is based only on my
personal experience and very humble opinnion. Good luck to you all...
Raymond.
