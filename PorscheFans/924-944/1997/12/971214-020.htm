Greetings,

My hatch now properly unlocks after I shorten both sides, but won't stay up
'cause both hatch-shocks are worn.  Can anyone recommend an inexpensive
place to get new ones?  They're so expensive @ Automotion!

I also need to change my rear-shocks (car).  I have some generic brand on
it right now, comparitively as soft as OEM.  I want it much stiffer, but am
hoping for alternatives to Koni or Bilstine (can't afford it).  My car will
not see auto-X (can't afford new tires), so it's just for street handling.
And although I leave enough Hondas behind on corners, I'd like to extend
that gap more, without spending too much. 

And if there are no alternatives, which is better:  Koni or Bilstine?

Also, if I change my shocks, do I have to realign my car?

I'd also like to comment that the internet and email has greatly improved
consumers' ability to fight back.  Kempton.  I'll remember that name.  I
hope to hear a reply from Kempton posted on the list though, because I'd
hate to have fallen into a trap laid by Kempton's competition.  (no
offense, don't flame me, it's just possible & I don't want to be persuaded
so easily and discount Kempton immediately).  But I have to admit that a
warning of anytype is better than no warning about a company.

All Help TIA,
Tony C.

hey Porschefans,

a question for the 931 owners out there,  do you have green backlighting in
your instruments?  i seem to remember someone telling me this, but??
if this is true are they any better than the standard gauges? if theyre an 
improvement i might want to think about installing them in my 924 n/a .
comments ???

thanks,
eric
