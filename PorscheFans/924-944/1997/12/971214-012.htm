I recently found a rare treat at Sam's Club.  There was a large hardbound 
book called "Porsche The Fine Art Of The Sports Car" available for $25.

The author was listed as Lucinda Lewis, although she was responsible for 
the excellent photographs.

Published by Thunder Bay Press, ISBN number 1-57145-135-8.

This book has been updated as of 1997 and includes the Boxster, but 
curiously has left no mention of the S2.  Other than that, I rate this 
book as first rate publication.  The photography is outstanding.

One source that might be worth investigation is the last issue of 
Excellence magazine.  That issue has an index for all previous articles 
that could be used to track down anything you want.
