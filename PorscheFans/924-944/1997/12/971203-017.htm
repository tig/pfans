I'm sure this has been beaten to death in the past, but I just got back 3 fax
quotes from zim's, McGill, and Vertex on a list of stuff for my 924S.  McGill
and zim's indicate that porshce no longer provides "new" water pumps, but
rather remanufactured units (presumeable by the oem) Zim's claims, which I
have heard before, that the rebuilt units which they offer have better seals
and bearings than the factory units. Vetex offers the new unit, but I suspect
it is just the oem rebuilt plus the core charge. Since prices for these vary
widely among suppliers there must be more than one rebuild source. I can see
the seals being better, but the bearings? Seems like only 1 size bearing
would fit the application, and its hard to imagine much room for improvement
there. I have to admit I am still tempted to stick with the factory rebuild,
since they may have a lower tollerance for wear on the parts, and me less
economically motivated to avoid replacing things like shafts. Any opinions?
BTW, zims and vertex are very close on price except for the transmission
damper plate, where vertex is lower by 90 bucks. McGill is not much more
either, and being a dealer may be better at providing the right current
parts, though they are almost 200 bucks more on the damper. All three
returned my faxed quote request within a few hours. Its a nice and efficient
way to shop, I would think they even prefer it, since they can bid it during
lulls in work.
