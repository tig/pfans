Chris, 120K miles is really would be considered about average mileage for a
10 year old car.  I think the average (per the blue book) is 12K a year (I
think this is a bit low personally).  While you are right in that there is
a potential conflict of interest here, I would think that taking the car to
another mechanic would be sufficient to verify that all of the items that
they claim have been replaced.  As for records, the owner should be
providing them, not the shop.  If it is a reputable shop, I would think it
pretty unlikely that they would fake repair bills just to help the owner
sell the car. 

Certainly it is possible that you may have to replace some of the
ancillaries in the not too distant future but these are relatively
inexpensive compared to the clutch job and replacing the water pump/belts
(it should have had the water pump replaced by now).  

Good Luck.
