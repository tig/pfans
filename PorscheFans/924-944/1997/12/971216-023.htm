The Porsche you are referencing is a 924 Carrera GT, not a GTS.  Both
cars were built as 1981 models and have regular serial numbers, starting
 with WPOZZZ and were not built for export into the U.S. 

 There are a number of differences between the GT and the GTS.  The GT
was a rebodied 924 Turbo with a small intercooler to produce the
210BHP., wider wheels and tires and a full interior. There were 400-500
of these built.
 
The GTS was a different chassis with different front and rear coil over
suspension, fiberglass and plexiglass used extensively, 911 turbo
brakes, 245 BHP engine, the racing GTR style gearbox, 7X16 and 8X16
wheels, stripped interior with 935 style racing bucket seats, etc.
There were around 50 of these built.
 
My GTS was a Club Sport (about 5 in the world) which had been Norbert
Singer's car.  The Club Sport had about 285BHP, 8" wheel front and Rear,
full aluminum roll cage, coil overs, etc.  0-60 was about 5.0 Seconds
and it would do a 1/4 mile in 12.9 Sec. (this was in the early 80's).
 
The Carrera GTR was the full factory race version of the 924.  Racing
IMSA in 1984 with the John Schneider Performance Motorsports team, we
were getting close to 400BHP out of the 924 based engine.  Pretty
impressive.
 
I have a full owners manual for a GT and a GTS, plus the factory parts
and service manual for the Carrera GTS, so further information is
available.
