I have just developed a rather large coolant leak from my 88 944na, with
the car up on jack stands it looks like it's coming from around the
water pump area. I've checked all the hoses and they all appear to be in
good shape. Once I remove the timing cover will I be able to determine
for sure it's the pump? Does anyone have any input on new vs.rebuilt
water pumps and a good reliable source? I know there is no good time for
a pump to bad but I'm about 3,000 mi from a belt change so I'll just do
everything at once.

TIA & Wishing Everyone a Happy New Year!

Chas.

<< I just went out to check out my son's old  AUDI 4000 Quattro----- it needs
help !!! 
 He is visiting here for vacation from UAB grad school and is heading back on
Fri. He 
 has to go to St. Louis on Mon., so he's taking my S2. I know my shop is
closed next 
 week, so he'll have to find someone " knowledgable" in Birmingham who can
help keep 
 it on the road for a couple more years !!!   >>


Paul,
I'ld recommend Southern Star Motor Company in Anniston (205-236-5389).  It's
about an hour from Birmingham on the interstate though.  Euraisan Auto in
Birmingham is owned by the AL region PCA Tech guy, Bill Mitchell
(205-251-9263).  I don't know if they do Audi's though. The local Birmingham
dealer is Tom Williams (everything from Audi to Cadillac.).  I know one
mechanic that works there and he is good.  I can't speak for the rest of them,
I'm just not sure.  

Good luck,
Bob

All,
I've got about 50k miles on my clutch ('86 951 chipped).  It had 10k miles on
a new clutch/waterpump/belts job.  I don't drag race it (except maybe 8 or 10
times tops.  I do drive it hard though, but I'm pretty good about waiting
until the clutch is engaged before hammering it.  I checked the distance from
the slave cylinder piston to the inspection hole wall, it's about .75 inches.
The Hayne's manual says 1.34in service limit and 0.71 new clutch.  I don't
know what kind of clutch is in it, but the previous owner said it was a 930
clutch.  He wasn't really into the speed thing that much,  but he did say "930
clutch".  I'll probably call the shop that did it since I have the reciept and
see if they know.  

Either way, I'm faced w/ a 55k or so mile clutch in a tweeked 951 that's
0.04in to being at the new clutch thickness.  I don't buy it.

Anybody have any idea what could be changing measured distance?  I guess it
could be a bent (whatever that forked lever is called).
