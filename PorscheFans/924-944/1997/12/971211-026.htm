Whoa! Let's not start a boycott yet.  George and Jason haven't got all the
parts, and Carlsen's an outlet for Porsche Express. I've gotten some decent
prices from them, relatively speaking.  Before we start this boycott, what
are the other Porsche Express dealer we can switch business to?  Don't
wanna sound like I'd put my finances before my pride - but hey....

On the other hand, an experienced 911 driver in an older car can really
embarass a 944 on a corner exit.  Gotta admit that I do kind of envy all
the weight in rear sometimes.  I think maybe the Rocky Mt Region doesn't
have quite the same oil/water caste system as the West Coast.  On the other
hand, it is especially fun to pass someone in their shiny new 993.

I smoke.  Wish I had at least a couple of lighters - one for the radar
detector, and another for the onboard computer to modify chips on the fly .

>Farzaan.
>89 951 - one day I'll own a C2 Turbo, but I won't trade my 951 to get it!

Sounds right. I've been tempted to trade, but never that tempted. Wonder if
I'll stay the same wonderful water-cooled person I am now if I spent too
much time in a C2.
