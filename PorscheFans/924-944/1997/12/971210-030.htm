Howdy guys,

Boy, I'm having some bad luck selling these parts!  Both of the buyers for
them have backed out, one because his deal on an 89 fell through, and
the other because the wheels will not fit correctly on their p-car.  So,
I'm open to offers.  I would still like US$200 for the chips (includes the
K&N if you want it).  I'll pay for shipping.

The wheels I'm open to offers.  Paul is now willing to seperate the tires
from the wheels.  So I have the following to sell:

4 Forged Turbo S wheels painted in Volvo T5-R charcoal color, PERFECT
condition.  (2) 16x7 and (2) 16x9.  Make me an offer.

2 225/50R16 brand new Kuhmo race tires.
2 245/45R16 almost new Kuhmo race tires.
4 265/45R16 USED Kuhmo race tires.

If the wheels/tires don't sell, I'm going to buy them for myself.  I want
to go big brakes this season so I wanted to change everything to 17", but
I'm willing to hang on to the smaller brakes if no one buys the wheels.

Farzaan.
