Hi All,

I've been noticing a strange squeeky noise that sounds like it is coming
from the left side of the dash.  It could only be heard when turning left.
Then, the other day I noticed it slightly while driving in a straight line.
 I thought it might be a wheel bearing but when I drove in a left hand
circle in the parking lot, my buddy couldn't hear it outside the car.  

Yesterday I was driving at lunch and had the air circulation set so air was
coming in from outside.  Since I was in traffic, I could smell exhaust
fumes from other cars and set it to recirculate and cracked the windows.
As soon as I hit the recirculation button, the squeeking noise started.  I
hit the button again and it stopped.  I hit the button again and it
started, then I put the fan from 0 to 4 and back to 0 and it stopped.  This
is driving me nuts.  I guess it is the fan but why would it have originally
started when making left turns.  Can the fan motor be oiled?  I have no
idea where it is even located.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

TIA

Michael
