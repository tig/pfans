Hello P-Fans,

Until last night Porschefans had been the only web service of this type
that I have experienced. Back in Aug. thinking I would never be interested
in any type of chat group, newsgroup, etc I stumbled upon Porschefans and
have been hooked ever since...it's like a drug or something! Last night I
looked at a newsgroup. It was a car-type of interest group but not
model-specific. I personally don't care for the format but that is beside
the point...one could get use to the format. I should describe the group
mostly as a "bitch and flame" group. 

Reading it left me feeling proud to be a part of this group. Even though
we're some 1500 strong we are like a family. We can have a good time, kid 
each other AND have intelligent discussion. We're a group where we are
serious about the topic. We are a group of honest people, we're honest with
each other in our discussions but we also respect each other and their
opinions. Yes, we have arguments...heated at times...but we've been able to
work through those times. We are very fortunate to have little to no spam.
I can put up with the occasional software glitches in order to have the
quality of discussion of Porschefans. In fact...admit it...the glitches add
a comedic element.  

Let's all be proud to be a part of Porschefans and keep it the sort of
group where one can come to learn, have fun, and express opinions in a
forum where respect is still important...no matter how large our group
gets.

Thanks
