Hi,

I'm having weird problems with my new Bosch Super 4 spark plugs. I own a
1981 European 2 liter Porsche 924. My spark plugs are W78.

Below is what I noticed about my engine while under load (gear engaged):

* Between idle and 2000rpm, the engine is smooth and power is good.
* Between 2000rpm and 3000rpm, the engine jerks once every 3 seconds
(during acceleration only). Power is still great.
* After 3000rpm, the engine will suddenly stop jerking and the power is
back to normal (like using my old W7DC). There's also a new noise like some
soft throbbing vibration noise.

There used to be a metalic burning smell from my exhaust. With my new
plugs, the smell is gone.

Can anybody explain the jerky movements and weird throbbing noise that I'm
experiencing?

A mechanic told me that the W78 is for carburetor engines. He said the W78
SR models are for fuel injected engines. My engine is a fuel injected one.
What do you think? There shouldn't be a difference whether your engine is
caburetor or fuel injected, right?

Thanks.

Chor-Eng
