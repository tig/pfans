MR,
I changed the erl last night. I also got spooked and went back to dino.
Valvoline 20-50. I was using Valv 50W prior to switching to synth but
was feeding it quite a bit. The Mobil one didn't burn off as much so
we'll see what the 20-50 does. It kinda bothers me to be switching so
much.

Also last night cleaned up the front of the engine real good. I'll be
able to spot leaks more easily now. When changing the oil filter
discovered that the genius who did my last oil change put the drain
plug seal on the OIL FILTER. I don't think the filter was leaking but
some of the oil was below the filter...so...I'm hoping this was an easy
fix.
