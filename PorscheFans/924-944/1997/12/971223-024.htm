David,
      You posted that when performing a compression test that pressure 
readings should be very close to target on the first compression stroke? If 
not, then the rings are most likely worn? I thought it was normal for it to 
take a few compression strokes to reach the max value. I haven't checked our 
944's compression, but I did check the compression on our Jeep. I videotaped 
the gauge while cranking so that I could later watch the tape to take readings 
from the gauge after each compression stroke. I then plotted pressure vs. 
stroke for each cylinder, all were within about 5 PSI of each other, and 
reached the desired max pressure within 3-4 compression strokes. Based on 
that, I had concluded that our Jeep engine was ok. I believe the Jeep Haynes 
manual said the readings should reach the desired pressure within a few 
compression strokes.. My compression gauge has a one way valve such that 
between compression strokes, the gauge holds pressure. If you have details as 
to the correct method for performing a compression test on engines, let me 
know..

  Also, without a leak down gauge (I assume this is just an air flow meter 
calibrated in some sort of units), is there any way to perform a leakdown 
test? I pressurized each cylinder on our NA 944 engine earlier this spring 
after I replaced the valve guide seals, and could hear air leaking out the 
exhaust valves but not the intake valves (Yes, I used the flywheel lock to 
keep the engine from turning at TDC for each cylinder) I was  using a sears 
portable 12v compressor I carry around in the car for the inflatable spare, so 
I didn't reach huge pressures, I think it got to 25-30psi before the leakage 
past the exhaust valve matched the flow rate of the compressor thereby 
limiting the pressure. I do plan to re-build the head this winter..

Thanks for any advice anyone out there has!

Happy Holidays!
 Ezra
