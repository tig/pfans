I can also hear the mechanism working.  Releases the left side with no
problems but the right side is still engaged.  It doesn't bother to have to
raise the hatch myself, I can live with that but it would be nice if it
released both latches as it should.  The first time the right side didn't
release I was quite pissed.  Why?  This is going to sound real "feminine"
but I broke 3 fingernails when I tried to lift and only one side was
released.  Please no comments about that.  My stance is that blondes in
Porsches must look good at all times.

enough upon opening to clear the latching mechanism.

I will be checking this thing out over the weekend to see if cleaning and
any adustments will cause it to work properly.  I'll let everyone know what
I do and hopefully what works.
