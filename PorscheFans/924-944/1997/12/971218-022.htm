I'd like to add that finding shops that can resiliconize the blocks is hard.
 I'm sure finding shops that can do it well is harder.

The Vega had the same kind of cylinder walls.  The machinist I'm using belongs
to a network of engine builders.  He said that to his knowledge the percentage
of people having success re conditioning the Vega engines was 0.

If anyone does have liners installed in the block.  Make sure you go to a place
that has the correct boring tool for aluminum.  Cast iron tools basically chip
out the iron.  Aluminum is softer so a different bore should be used.  (I'm not
saying that boring aluminum can't be done with the other bore, just that the
principles are different).
