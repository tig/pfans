As richard sharpe <richard.sharpe@bellsouth.co.nz> suggested to me, I'd
like to "float" this idea to the collective:

I'm trying to come up with a "personalized" license plate for the 968.  I
am allowed 7 characters, and letters must precede numbers, with a minimum
of 4 letters to qualify (and, no, I can't get PORSCHE - already taken).  I
was thinking, perhaps, A NEIN 68?
(I had TRBO S 44 on the U-boat).
Other thoughts I've already had include:
	A NINE 68
	NEIN 608 (NINE SIXTY EIGHT)
	NINE 608

All suggestions gratefully appreciated.

telling when that extra 30-36" of height off the floor might come in handy)

Nick baby.....I never thought of drilling holes in the intake
manifold!!!....and to think that Porsche spent all the time and money
complicating the intake manifold on the late 3.6 911 motors with the Vario-Ram
system....all I can guess is that you were smart enought to patent the idea,
and Porsche was still too embarrassed with the Mitsubishi balance shaft thing
to pay you for the idea. 
 
 On the turbo's I have been replacing that puzzling extra radiator that the
intake charge is forced to go through with a nice piece of PVC pipe. Way less
restriction then that stupid and heavy radiator. I'm sure it's at least 75hp.
I Can't understand why Porsche left that one on the table? Maybe an attempt to
sell more 928's and 911 turbo's ?(they did that with engine mapping instead,
lucky for us).
 
 Farrazan is right about the normally aspirated cars, it's though going to get
more than a modest gain on these cars. My experience,  like Farrazan's, is
supported with dyno time.  I find that establishing a baseline is sometimes
more relevant than actually finding more horsepower. "Seat of the pants" is
deceiving... 
 
 The best improvement I have seem on a non-turbo 944 engine was a very high
compression 2.7 8 valve with Motec engine management.  That car came in at
just over 190 horsepower at the rear wheel. I attribute the gain to high
compression and removal of the restrictive airflow sensor.   
 
 A fellow racer with a 968 engined 1983 944 got 231 hp on the same dyno. We
dicked around with three chips, crazy fuel pressure, and big exhaust to gain
22 horsepower.  We did manage to flatten the powerband by adjusting the fuel
pressure. The DynoJet dyno we use has a very fast reacting $4000 Motec lamda
sensor that we screwed into the stock location to read O2 content. 
 
 On all these runs we assume a very conservative 10% drivetrain loss.
 
 Enough of my bandwaisting drivel.......
