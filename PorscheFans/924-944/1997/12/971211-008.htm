I've done a few things to my '86 944NA lately (sealed some vacuum leaks,
changed the exhaust system, disconnected the O2 sensor, changed the air
filtration, etc.) and my idle speed at this point has gradually risen to
a rock steady 1250 rpm. Not good. I pulled my trusty Haynes manual to
try to figure out how to adjust the idle and found the all too common
response of "due to the special equipment required, it is recommended
that you take your car to the dealer for this adjustment" and no
description of the procedure followed. Is this indeed the only way to do
this? I recently saw some one else ask about idle speed adjustment, but
never saw a response. If anybody knows anything about idle speed
adjustments I'd be greatful for your advice. Haynes is certainly a
disapointment in regards to this car. I owned and worked on MGB's for
years. The Haynes manuals for these cars was excellent. They would tell
you if they felt a job was beyond the scope of the home mechanic, but
the procedure was still detailed after the disclaimer. Is there a good
after market book for 944's or must one bite the bullet and buy the
factory manuals?

Any help or advice is appreciated.

Philip
