From the info provided on the web site for Profec, (I think it's
www.greddy.com) the unit uses "fuzzy logic" to learn the characteristics of
the system it is in. It then manages the boost by anticipating the spikes
and flat spots in the system. Whether this would offer protection in an
emergency is debatable, but perhaps it would prevent the emergency. In any
event, full boost at the top end is a new experience for me!

P-fans,
I just bought a set of Porsche aero mirrors from a  Porsche dealer. The kit is
specifically for the 944, 19851/2 to 1991. Has anybody else installed a set of
these? I looked at the instructions and everything looks pretty straight
forward, but what has me wondering is how to compress the rather large spring
enough to allow the retaining pin to lock into the mirror frame. Anybody have
any ideas or tricks to get it locked together? Bill, my clutch on my 86' 951
is as smooth as silk, no vibration, the brakes are really good, although I
think better pads will make it stop alot better. TIA
Colin F. 86' 951 KC region

Jeez, Nick, I was thre quarters of the way through with the mods you putlined
before I realized it was a joke!

He installed a new carb, saved 10% on gas. New tires, 5%. New air filter,
10% etc. etc. etc. He was "saving" so much, pretty soon he was having to
stop to drain gas out.>>

During my drag racing days, if I had obtained the promised horsepower from
each of the mods I bought, I'd have 1000 h.p. from the old 5.0.
