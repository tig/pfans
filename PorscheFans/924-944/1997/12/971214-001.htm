>The normally aspirated cams may have longer exhaust duration, but don't be
thinking that is just dandy and run over to the Aase Bros. and grab the
fastest cam they have. The reason that this naturally aspirated cam has
what it has is for better breathing. Cylander filling in a forced induction
engine is easy, in a normally aspirated car... quite a bit more difficult
(see varioram and or variocam).
>When a normally aspirated cam is put on a turbo application you are
subjecting yourself to valve overlap. Both valves at this point are open,
and the turbo willl make short work of ifself by feeding 1 bar straight
through the intake. With a turbo motor  decreased valve overlap is more
beneficial... having as much air/gas in the cylanders as possable is
already attained. For cams for your turbo motor go looking at powerhaus
(www.powerhaus.com) for some great stuff over there. 
>And to whoever is wanting to trade the most balenced car in history for an
Audi powered piece...save your money and keep dreamin'
>Just my 2cents
