I've just replaced all my wiper bladess on my 944 with
Bosch.  Micro Edge Excel on the front (replaced the
old SWG wipers entirely), and found a Micro Edge II
blade-only which would fit in the OEM rear wiper.  But
there is one detail:

The Excel wiper is not symmetric.  On the top from the
middle, one side has a very rapid downward curve.  The other
side is more wing-like.  There is no documentation showing
which way the wiper should be installed - the instruction
sheet is useless.  And the Porsce wiper arms have enough
clearance to accept the wiper either way.

So I've walked up and down the street and some parking lots
looking at various MB, BMWs, VWs, etc to see how they do it.
Some have the wing half facing out (i.e., the 'micro edge excel'
logo on the blade faces up), some in (logo faces the hood),
and found one car that had one wiper one way and one the
other...  Anyone know the correct direction?

Also, anyone have an opinion on the Hella Vision Plus H4
lights?  Or the Zelmot 'off road use only' lights?
Automotion has both.  Or something else?  The FAQ mentions
European Hella H4 which I'd assume is comparable to the
Zelmots?  I currently have the Sylvania sealed beams installed.
But one of which has collected a 'rock star' recently so it
is time to replace.
