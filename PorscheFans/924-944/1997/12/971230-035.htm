Vaughan,
 Assuming my 944 head is not all that different than your 924 head, maybe this 
applies to you. I replaced the valve guide seals on our '86 NA 944 last 
Spring. I tried an overhead valve spring compressor (grabs the bottom of the 
spring, compresses on the top), and it did not work. The 944 valves have two 
springs, one inside the other. The tool only grabbed the outer spring (and not 
very well at that), and did nothing to compress the inner spring. I returned 
the tool, and fashioned my own. It is kind of difficult to describe this with 
words, but I have a lousy polaroid snapshot of the jig on the engine that I 
will scan in and e-mail to you after work. Here goes my attempt to describe in 
words what I did. Obviously, you will need to remove the cam housing and stuff 
that is in the way. Make sure you don't mix up the hydraulic lifters, they 
need to go back in the same order to maintain the clearances that you 
currently have. With the cam housing removed, I built two plywood U shaped 
rails which I mounted above the valves. Here is a lousy ASCII drawing:

  I Placed L shaped metal brackets on the bottom of the legs, mounting those 
brackets to holes on the top surface of the head (use washers to protect the 
Al surface of the head). With both of these rails mounted to the head, it 
looked something like the following (viewed from the front of the engine):

             Cup shaped thing to sit on valve


Shown between the rails is a piece of wood with a threaded rod. I used a T-nut 
in the piece of wood for the threaded rod. This piece of wood can slide along 
the length of the rails for positioning of the end of the threaded rod above 
any of the valves. I placed two nuts on the top of the threaded rod so I could 
use a wrench to turn the threaded rod. On the other end of the threaded rod, I 
placed an aluminum U shaped piece which I fabricated from aluminum bar (1/4" x 
1" I think). I used nuts mounted on the threaded bar so that the U shaped 
piece could rotate with respect to the threaded bar (use washers and grease), 
but could not tilt much from the axis of the threaded rod. This U shaped piece 
then sits on the valve, you turn the threaded rod to compress the spring, and 
reach between the U shaped piece to remove the keepers, then loosen to remove 
the springs. (I placed each respective cylinder at TDC to hold the valve in 
place while compressing the valve spring, having an interference design helps 
sometimes!!) Remember to stuff rags in the oil galleys or you may be removing 
the oil pan (not a fun job, believe me) to find your lost keepers.

  To remove the valve seals, I took another piece of aluminum bar, bent it 
into an L shape, drilled a hole in the short leg of the L (same diameter as 
the valve guide), then cut the short leg of the L halfway through the hole. On 
the end of the long arm of the L, I bent it such that I could place a 
screwdriver shaft under it as a lever to pull the L shape away from the head, 
thereby pulling the valve guide seal off. Here is an attempt at another lousy 
drawing..

It took me about 2 hours to build and mount this thing, and it worked great. I 
will scan the picture in, and send it to you from my AOL account at home 
(HallAudio@aol.com).

The basic procedure is:

  o rotate engine to TDC for one of the cylinders, lock crankshaft in place
  o For each of the valves on the cylinder in question, 
    - removing keepers
    - loosen and remove springs (make sure you keep them together so when 
      you assemble they have the same orientation)
    - remove valve guide seals with homemade tool
    - install new valve guide seals. For this I used a small socket that 
      fit around the top of the seal, and tapped the socket with a hammer 
      to  drive the seal on, make sure the seal stays square to the valve
      guide, and be carefull not to damage the seals or the little spring
      o-rings that hold the seals tight against the valve stem.
  
o Remeber to keep everything clean, and use assembly lube!

Sorry I couldn't do a better job describing it, give me a call if you get 
stuck (802)878-7031.

Good Luck!
Ezra
