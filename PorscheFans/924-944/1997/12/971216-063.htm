Ian, a similar thing happened on my '84 944. The door handle needed to
be replaced. Just work slowly and carefully with the trim stuff and have
lots of plastic baggies or an ice cube tray handy to store the screws
and bits. 

For the early interior cars, if I remember correctly.:

1) Unscrew the lock knob and remove it.
2) Pull out the inner trim piece behind the door handle. Remove the
screw and the finger guard.
3) Remove the speaker grill.
4) Remove the door pocket (three screws).
5) Remove the three screws under the armrest. Leave it hanging gently.
6) Remove the two screws (under plugs) at the top of the door panel
(front and back)
7) Unsnap the clips around the perimeter of the panel with a wide putty
knife. (I use a flathead screwdriver gently.)
8) Lift the door panel up and off the door, unplugging the window
switches/power mirror joystick.
9) Undo the lock linkage (little white plastic piece) on back of the
lock cylinder. Don't lose it.
10) Undo the latch linkage at the bottom of the door handle. My new door
handle came with a new linkage, and the old one was a pain to get out,
so I just cut the old one off. It's plastic.
11) Unscrew the screw in the end panel of the door that holds the handle
in. Slide the handle out.
12) With the key in the lock, remove the lock cylinder and its return
spring, and transfer it to the new handle. Don't pull the key out until
the cylinder is fully installed. Keep the hardware in order.
13) Installation is the reverse of removal. Replace the handle gaskets
while you're in there.

Alex.
