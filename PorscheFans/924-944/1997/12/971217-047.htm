Frenna,

There have been a number of companies that have made timing/balance belts for
the 944.  A few years ago it was Pirelli.  Earlier this year I bought belts
from the dealer, the belts came from a place in England (company name escapes
my mind).  Jim Pasha would know.

Porsche has changed the recommendations for changing intervals over the years,
probably in accordance to the belt manufacturer.  With belts bought from a non
dealership, this interval is probably different than what Porsche recommends.

I know nothing of TRW, except that they made my intake valves.  (and the
quality of craftsmanship could have been better!)

I wouldn't worry too much about the belts though.
