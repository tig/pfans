Armed with an old wiring diagram (85.5) and my new driving light conversions, I 
decided to look into putting them into the car .. On my other 
Porsches,(356,early911), the wiring has been rather straight forward and easy to get 
to. Due to my early schematic and a wiring system that seems to have several 
deviations due to world-wide markets, this conversion has got my stumped. Since the 
Euro driving lights don't go through a switch and are actvated solely by the 
high-beams, there is no means to turn them off if they are not needed. I have my 
fogs set up so I can have them on all the time and they are not turned on with the 
low-beams only. If possible, I would like the driving lights to work this way 
also... At the least, I would like to have them on without the headlights, AND 
activated by the high-beams...

From the diagrams I have it seems that I should be able to set up a second "fog 
light" switch {or a rear-fog switch ?? ) in the rear foglight switch location to get 
the desired result. From what I can see from my diagrams, the US models have no lead 
from the high beam relay(G12) to the driving lights. The switched power goes to the 
fog-light switch !! From my previous work on these cars, I figure the wires are 
there, just not connected !!! The world market deviations seem to center on the CEB 
bridge ( G6). From my info, the ROW bridge ( 944.610.183.02 ) allows the fogs to 
operate like I have mine set up now. The original bridge on the US cars was (.00), 
my S2 has (.06 ) in the G8 slot. Will replacement of the bridge with a RoW model 
help my conversion??? Is it necessary ???

As you can tell, I'm no EE, and my resident elec. eng. has not looked at this yet. I 
want to have all my info together before I show him what I need designed. Has anyone 
else made this conversion on a US model? What parts were necessary (besides lights!) 
Was the wiring in place at the front of the car?? I know I need a relay, ( even 
though the factory doesn't show one for the driving lights), where was it placed ?? 
Did you have to set up a new lead from #86 on the high beam relay, or could you 
change it at the rear of fog-light switch??  If possible, I would like to follow the 
factory set up, except for needing an on-off switch. Can I just add another dash 
switch and wire it into the fog switch ??? There are still many questions to getting 
this set up the way I want it, and ANY info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for 
ANY help......
