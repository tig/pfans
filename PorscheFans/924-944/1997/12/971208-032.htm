Ezra,
ok, I've removed outer boot(inner already removed). Can't really determine
any rotational play but maybe don't know what I'm looking for. Inspect
shifter for wear on the linkage. Doesn't really look worn but rust
colored(rusted?). It seems to be evenly cylindrical, maybe evenly worn?
Someone else suggested replacing the shifter before concerning shifter
sloppiness but I didn't replace it so this is probably the answer. However,
if I place trans in gear, then disconnect shifter from shift rod, should
the shift rod(going back to tranny) be able to be moved from side to side
or
should it be stationary, mine will swing like a pendulum. Is this normal?
