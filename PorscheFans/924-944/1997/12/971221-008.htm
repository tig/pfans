I've unsubscribed to all and subscribed to the lists again.  I hope this
kills the bug and I apologize to all and look forward to all the love
and happiness coming my way.

I still mean what I said about the newsletter, as if you could miss it.

Someone like Kevin Gross could provide the best advice on this, but for what
it's worth I bought an 85.5 with 26,000 miles on it and a whine in the
transaxle (primarily when accelerating or decelerating).  When I sold it 5
years and 80,000 miles later, it had the same whine and the transaxle still
operated perfectly.  I've heard others say the same.

Marshall,
One other CRITICAL element to successfully bleeding the clutch, besides
getting the back of the car way up in the air, is to keep the fluid reservoir
topped up while bleeding.  You'll notice that the hose from the reservoir to
the clutch master cylinder is mounted high on the side of the reservoir (it's
a safety feature -- prevents a clutch system hydraulic leak from draining all
the fluid from the brake system).  If you have two people to assist you, one
can keep it full while one pumps the pedal (pulling it up by hand) and one
bleeds (that would be the one under the car tearing up knuckles on the starter
motor!).  With only two people doing it, you'll need to stop every few cycles
to refill the reservoir.  By the way, with respect to the MityVac, I've found
it very usefull for purging fluid, but less effective than the old "pump-the-
pedal" method for final bleeding.  Others have had more success with it.
