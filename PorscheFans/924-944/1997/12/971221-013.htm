Does anyone know where the fuse is for the power antenna in a '84 944?
I have no +12 to the hot lead yet all the fuses are good. Of course the
Haynes manual is useless. Any hints appreciated!

I'm the proud (and frustrated) owner of an '83 944 with 101k miles.  She's a
fantastic toy to drive, but in need of some TLC.  I'm in Iowa as a result of a
job change, and my local Porsche dealer is a Pontiac guy who got the
contract... <LOL>

Okay.. three Questions:

1.  It's time for shocks and struts.  I have a friend with a 944 that replaced
his with Monroe shocks instead of Koni or Bilstein.  The cost difference is
significant!  I've never driven a 944 with good performance shocks.. (mine
were going when I bought the car.)  How much a difference will it be if I go
with my wallet rather than my heart?

2.  The idle is jumpy as hell, and the worst when the car is cold.  Where
should I start looking for problems?

3.  The power antenna is stuck open half way.  I knew it needed help when I
bought it.  I checked all the fuses and they were good... how difficult is it
gonna be to replace the motor?


Thanks for any and all help,
Lawrence
