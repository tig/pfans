Cason, 
I saw your post from November 22nd and have just had a chance to get back 
to you now with my experiences. One of the best attributes of Porsche 
sports cars are their rear seats. Sure, those seats are the brunt of alot 
of jokes. I can recall a Nissan commercial for example showing a 
passenger being folded up to be placed into the rear seat of a 911 cab. 
but for kids up to age 12 or so, they are just perfect. Most important, 
you can have a much easier time justifying the purchase of this car when 
it can haul the family unit, try that with a corvette. I presently have 
two children, ages 8 and 5, and one Porsche 968 cabriolet. I owned a 1987 
944 Turbo before the 968. My son was only 1 when I purchased the 944. An 
aftermarket child's car seat was able to fit in the rear of the 944 yet 
because the seats were so contoured I had to stack a couple of books on 
the seat, then rest the car seat on top of them. The lap belt on the 944 
went right through the rear of the car seat. A three point belt from a 
968 coupe should be no problem either. I have heard that Porsche made 
special child seats for their cars but they are very expensive ($500) and 
you're not likely to receive one as a shower gift. Once the child turns 
four or so the rear seat by itself is perfect for them. When you see a 5 
year old in the rear seat of a 944 you know who they made those seats 
for, the picture of comfort. Now for your 968 cabriolet question. the 944 
cabriolet in 1990 and 1991 had rear seats with a lap belt. In 1992 the US 
government said all cars had to have 3 point rear seat belts. Porsche 
decided that for the 968 cab, it wasn't worth the work to fit the three 
point belts so they installed dual, rear glove boxes, and the 968 coupe 
got the three point belts. Interesting enough, 968 cabs in europe 
continued to be equipped with the rear seats and lap belts. After selling 
my 944 I was looking to move up to a 968. I would have loved to purchase 
a cab but without rear seats it was out of the question, I was seaching 
for a coupe. When a 968 cab came up for sale locally I went to look at it 
to see the color (Amazon green) and with know intention of purchasing it. 
Upon a closer inspection I realized that the nuts for the rear seat belts 
where still located in the floors of the US made cars. I still wasn't 
interested in this car because cabs cost more then coupes but then I got 
a call. The seller was leaving the states for good and had to sell the 
car. For only $23K I purchased this 30K mile car, and it was a cabriolet! 
When I got it home I pulled out the rear glove compartments and installed 
a pair of lap belts from a wrecked 87 944. The family and I had a blast 
with the car over the past year. We took many long drives and even 
appeared in a parade. And we have quite the reputation with my 8 year old 
daughter's friends of having the "coolest" car. I hope all this helps 
make your case to your significant other. Porsche's are great cars, the 
whole family agrees. 
Good luck, 
Jeff Coe
1992 968 cabriolet 6spd, now with 34k miles.
