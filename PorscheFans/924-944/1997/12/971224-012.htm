There aren't any 255s for 16" rims.  You can run 255/40-17 without a
problem.  My son has the Bridgestone S-02s (225/50 and 245/45-16) on his
turbo and they are very fine for street use, especially in the wet.  I've
also heard they work well on the track, but any tire you run on the track
will get trashed in a hurry.  There is a local 993TT S that runs S-02s on
the track and they go away in a hurry.  The Michelin MXX3 is another =
great
tire.  Robert Wood at Wheel Enhancement says they are even better than =
the
S-02 on the street, but the S-02 is better on the track.  Any way you go
you will ruin a good set of street tires in a hurry, so why not have both
street and track tires?
