"The reason the guy put the V-8 in there was because they blew the factory
944 motor and had the cylinder honed (those who are familiar know where 
this is going).  They did not know of the special coating Porsche puts on
the cylinders (I believe it's called Nikasil, correct me politely if I'm
wrong) and when the motor was fired up for the first time, the piston
siezed to the cylinder (sounds like they really messed up).  At that point,
he was ticked off and stuck the V-8 in there."


It is rather hard to imagine that anyone but the most 'isolated' machinist
would not notice that the 944 block is aluminum and without steel liners
and then proceed to hone as if it were a typical cast iron block.  The fact
that you can carry one of these blocks around rather easily on your
shoulder should have been a powerful clue that it was not cast iron.  If
anyone takes their expensive Porsche parts to such a place then I can only
say they will get what they paid for.
