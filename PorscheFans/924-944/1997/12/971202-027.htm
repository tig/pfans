P-fans,
I cut open my old coolant recovery tank to try and find out what the black
stuff is that is sticking around the ribs of the tank. The stuff is not oil,
but seems to be thick black grease, almost like wheel brg grease.Funny thing
, I tried to smell it and couldn't smell anything. My mechanic thinks that it
is some old assembly lube someone used when installing the water pump and
that it is still being flushed out of the system. Any ideas as to where the
grease could be comig from? The car runs cool and everything seems to be
fine. I would like to give the mechanic some ideas when I see him tomorrow.
TIA
