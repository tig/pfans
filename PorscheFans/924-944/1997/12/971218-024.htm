On Monday of this week, I was dropping my wife off at work, and smelled a 
strong odor of gasoline from our '87 Jeep Cherokee (Vermont winters, and in 
particular other drivers are not very Porsche friendly, so no SUV flames 
please). Upon popping the hood, I immediately saw the problem, the #3 injector 
was squirting gasoline all over the intake and exhaust manifolds, creating 
wisps of white smoke. Not wanting to call for a tow, I wiggled the injector to 
seat it better in the fuel rail, and gingerly drove it home with the hood 
propped open for ventilation, no fire, phew... I drove our 944 to work on the 
snowy roads. After calling around town, the Jeep dealer was the only source 
for new o-rings. By lunch, the roads were cleared enough to drive the 10 miles 
to the Jeep dealer, so I set out in our trusty 944. About halfway back on my 
return trip, I was accelerating onto the highway, when I notice the exhaust 
getting louder. Then, vroooommmm, the entire vehicle vibrated from exhaust 
noise. Great, the exhaust system disconnected where the header pipe meets the 
Catalytic convertor. Suffice it to say, other drivers stayed well clear of our 
Guards Red roaring monster as I drove it the remaining 5 miles. Interestingly, 
the absence of exhaust from header on back did not increase engine power, but 
instead reduced throttle response and overall power and torque. Plus, with all 
that noise and vibration through the chassis and seat, I did my best not to 
use the gas too much. I did fix the Jeep the same day, but only took a look at 
the 944 exhaust. The weld on the pipe leading into the Cat. seems to have been 
faulty, as the Cat. and the pipe are intact, but the weld broke as if it 
wasn't bonded well to the metal (stainless steel). I will find out today if 
the local Midas or Meineke can fix it. If not, I guess it is off to the $$$ 
Porsche dealer..

Happy Holidays!

Ezra, now hard of hearing
