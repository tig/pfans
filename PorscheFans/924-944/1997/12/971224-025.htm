Whats all this about NA's being SUPER slow?
I've had my 85.5 for a year now, and I do want more power, but it isn't =
completely lacking in this car. Don't forget these are only 4 cyl =
vehicles. The new top end maxima, only does a 0-60 in 7.9 and its the =
fastest in its class, and I promise you this car smokes any civic out =
there (except non street legal monsters...) anyway, I paid $5600 for my =
car, and have put about $5000 into it including a paint job, new =
leather, and a turbo front end. For the $10,000 I've spent, yeah I could =
of bought a 951, but I didn't have all that money when I bought the car =
and well for 5600 I have yet to see many cars that are faster, handle =
better or look as nice.
and also, I've taken corners at speeds that would send most cars to the =
scrap heap (these car pull somewhere in the .8 G range, not bad really)
