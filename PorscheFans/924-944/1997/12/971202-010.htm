The relay that controls the interior fans in my 85.5 recently started
sticking.  First it stuck on and the fans didn't turn off when I left
the car, I noticed immediately, popped the hood, tapped the relay and it
shut off.  Then, a few days later it started sticking open...no A/C. 
Then it worked with the A/C button off, but quit working with it on
(still don't know what one has to do with the other).  I removed the
relay, took the cover off of it, cleaned it up with contact cleaner and
some fine sandpaper on the contacts...and it's worked great ever since. 
Try repairing it before you replace it.
