924-944 web page owners,

I've just created a 944 web page that includes a 'WebRing' link at the
bottom, which will link you directly to other 924-944 specific pages that
have joined the Ring.  There are directions on the page that instruct you
how to join the ring, and to add the link to the bottom of your web page. 

Take a look at http://www.efn.org/~gsdiseth/944.html/

After about a week, we now have 6 web pages in the Ring, and it would be
great to see more!  Point your browser at the page and experiment around..
it will give you a concept of how it works.  The idea is to give your web
page more exposure, and to give everyone in the Ring a distinct focus, and
a centrally located resource. 

This concept is hosted at http://www/webring.org/  They host the Rings 
created at the site.  I have no affiliation, I've just set up the Ring on 
their site.. and like Porschefans, there is no charge.

Take a look around, then add your web page to the Ring! There is no cost,
and commercial sites are welcome.  If you wish, send an e-mail to
gsdiseth@efn.org with any comments, bug reports, opinions, whatever.  I
thought I would stick my neck out a bit with this experiment to see how it
does.  I think it will be a valuable resource once a dozen or so web pages
join the Ring. 

 -Gregor  944 2.7.
