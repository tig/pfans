  REGARDING           Ignition switch replacement

Need a little help from someone knowledgeable on R&R'ing an ignition switch
assembly on a late model 944. I have a 1990 S2 cabriolet and my ignition
switch/key assembly is on its way out. If I turn the key to start the car,
it starts but the key does not return to the left without a little manual
manipulation. When the key is stuck to the right, the speedometer/odometer
and various electrical functions do not work. I wouldn't be terribly
concerned but I imagine one of these days the switch will die completely and
I may be stuck somewhere. I understand from speaking with a Porshe
dealership mechanic that the switch and tumbler assembly are both
individually replaceable but either one requires disassembly of most of the
dash (to the tune 0f 3.8 hrs). My @!*$$ extended warranty company won't pay
for the switch to be replaced (a premium coverage policy from Western
General, for which I paid $2400.00). Anyhow, I think I'll attempt to replace
this myself if I can get some good advise from Don or Kevin or anyone else
who has done this. Please e-mail me directly (in addition to posting it to
the list for others benefit. My e-mail addresses are ScotDygert@aol.com and
Scott_Dygert@smtp.svl.trw.com, please e-mail both as its the holidays and my
work schedule is a short one for the next few weeks. Thanks and Seasons
Greetings to all.
