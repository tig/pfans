[Hapgood, Matt]  - 2. How much do things in this car weigh,
specifically:
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - driver's power seat
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - passenger's power seat (probably the same as
drivers I'd assume)
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - rear seat tops
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - rear seat bottoms
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - tonneau cover
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - complete A/C system including condensor and all
hoses
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - all carpet
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - hood
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - doors
[Hapgood, Matt]  -    - glass, front rear and side each seperate if
anyone knows
[Hapgood, Matt]  - 3. What is a realistic weight that the 944T can be
brought down to?

[Hapgood, Matt]  Farzaan-

I have removed many of the items you list above from my 1989 951.  My
memory is sorta bad- but I'll take a stab at a few of these.  I used a
fairly accurate Pitney Bowes scale.

	power seats: 48 - 50 lbs. each (same both sides, includes
mounting hardware)
	rear seat top (one piece): 35 lbs.

I have also done the following:
	removed stock seats and rear seat back
	removed airbags from passenger side and replaced airbag steering
wheel
	removed all stock seat belt parts and attachments
	removed spare tire
	removed rear carpet set (it is HEAVY)
	removed front door speakers and Blaupunkt equalizer (but left
everything else)
	added a complete phoenix 7-lb fire system, window net, cut-off
switch...
	added a safety devices roll cage, with harness bar
	added 5-point Simpson harnesses (2)
	added Sparco Pro2000 seats with slider mechanisms (2): about 29
lbs. each w/ sliders	
	stock 7 & 9 x 16" forged wheels

The car weighed in at Roebling club race, half full of fuel, at 3089
lbs.  I was surprised at how light the car was, without doing any
difficult removals, and still being able to listed to the radio while
DRIVING to the track!

If you want me to weigh anything specific, let me know, I can probably
do New Years day.
