Phil,

Idle adjustment on the 944 involves three adjustments. Refer to a book =
called 'Bosch Fuel Injection Systems' for a really thorough explanation =
of how all this magical stuff plays, proper settings and procedures.=20

The three adjustments (that I know of) are:
1. Throttle plate opening-Small setscrew located below throttle cam
2. Idle adjust bypass screw-Brass shaft adjacent to throttle cam on top =
of throttle body
3. CO mixture-8mm Allen head screw under plug on Air Flow Meter

I'm going by memory, so please verify with the manuals, and if anyone =
knows of a better procedure, I'd like to hear it.=20
Before making adjustments, make sure everything is working properly.

Throttle plate should be set so that the butterfly is just off of the =
throttle body.(Static mechanical setting)
Disconnect the O2 sensor (to break the feedback loop from the computer) =
and run car until it's at operating temp.
Set the throttle by pass screw for proper idle.
Measure the voltage from the O2 sensor. (I think single wire sensors =
should be about 1.25 volts for proper mixture)
Pull the plug on the Air Flow Meter, and s-l-o-w-l-y adjust for smooth =
idle and proper voltage if it's incorrect. This adjusts the CO mix, so =
if you're in an emissions controlled area, be cautious and have it =
double checked. Mine passed emissions just fine using this technique.
Reconnect the O2 sensor, and retouch adjustments.

Note I do not have Porsche factory manuals, so I don't know the actual =
measurement for the throttle plate opening.

Good Luck!!!
