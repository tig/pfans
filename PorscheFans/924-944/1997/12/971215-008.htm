My two cents worth of advice may save others thousands.  As a Porsche
shop owner, naturally we warrant what we sell and what we service.  At
times, we have purchased an engine to install in a customers car when
their engine has suffered too much damage to rebuild.  Rarely have we
gotten a used motor from a salvage dealer that is in as good of
condition as has been stated (low mileage, clean, etc.)  We prefer to
perform our own rebuilds, especially after receiving a  rebuilt 911 SC
engine from Kempton.

The valve guides on this SC engine had been replaced, but not reamed. 
As the engine warmed up, the valves would stick in the guides.  After
several calls to Robert, his main attitude was..."well, someone new did
the motor, just send it back to us and I will replace it".  By that
time, we were hours into troubleshooting, and I'll be darned if I am
going to trust my time and my customers money to another possible
mistake.  Robert did send me about $800-900 to compensate us, which was
about half of what it should have been.

Since then we have received a distributor that was frozen (advance
plate), paid top dollar for a wheel that had significant curb damage
(but had been painted to look good), etc.  Robert's attitude has usually
been flipant ("just send it back", or "what did you expect"). 

One particular time, we checked with him for a price on a part for a
customer.  We found a much better price at Parts Heaven.  Robert called
me up and chewed me out over the phone for not buying the part from him.
I explained that we found the part significantly lower through another
location and he chewed on me even further.  I told him that about 75% of
the time, his parts are not as stated or we have some problem with them,
and I could no longer tolerate that.  He stated that he had the best
parts and no one could beat his price...which I laughed at.

The next day, I saw one of his ads encouraging customers to shop around
for prices and then to call him...well, if that is the case, he sure
didn't read his own ad.

My personal opinion does not matter about what his problem is, but that
has cost him the business of my Porsche shop.
