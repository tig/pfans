Dear Ray:
        I see Marv answered most of your questions.   Just for reference,
though, here are more data.  I have not had much of a chance lately to
really open up my car ('89 951, 75k miles) on the open road, and as a
result am only using about 1/3 quart every thousand miles, including a
minor leak waiting to be fixed. A buddy of mine with another '89 Turbo
(55k) lives out on the windward side of Oahu and has more chances for fun;
he uses almost a quart per thousand miles. This, I believe is quite normal
if you hit the boost often.
        My oil pressure gauge drops to about 3.5 at idle. I am using Amsoil
20W50 synthetic.
        In several recent articles in Excellence magazine, it is
recommended that a quality synthetic be used in turbocharged 944s because
of the high engine temparatures.  In Honolulu, because of the climate and
heavy traffic, I change the oil and filter every 3,000 miles to be safe.
Seems horrifically wasteful of oil, but hey, engine and turbo rebuilds can
be hell on the wallet.

Best wishes,
Khal Spencer
'89 951
Honolulu, HI
