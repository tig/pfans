never could get the gauges on my 924 to dry out. (Tried pulling the lens
cover plug and running the defroster on high to try and bake it out) Now
my 85 944 has the same annoying problem and the plug appears to be
'non-removable'.  <<

I'm a bit late responding to this but..  Try a product called Dry Z Air. 
It is sold in home improvement stores for removing moisture from closets
and the other small damp spaces in a house.  Just set it on the floor with
the car sealed up tight, and it should suck all the moisture out while the
car is parked.  Be prepared to pour the collected water out on a regular
basis.  I've never tried this, but hopefully it should bring the humitity 
down enough in the car so your guages clear up.

This is a great item for cars that are stored for extended periods as 
well.. keeps mustiness, mold and corrosion at bay.

<< You can see them gliding along the roads.  Long, wide, jet black, 
 foreboding, and sometimes fleeting.  Like some tall stranger dressed in 
 black drifting in to town, not hostile in their manners, but not 
 bolstering a friendly air either.  Their insignia is a little obscure as 
 well.  However, upon closer inspection you see Impala, yes, that's Chevy 
 to you. 
 
 So, what's up with this gun slinger from GM?  Are these the MX missile on 
 wheels, or are they all dressed up with no place to go?
 
 I never been challenged by one, but it would be nice to know what the 
 potential of those monsters are. >>

Marv,

My son has one of these and it may not be an MX missile but it's also
definitely NOT your grandfather's old Nash Rambler!  I've driven it a few
times and the car really has some guts . . . . . it's just so darn BIG!!!!!
It seems to take up the whole lane from the center stripe right to the
shoulder of the road.  And, when you stuff your foot in it you want to make
sure you're pointed in a straight line down the road.  Bottom line is if you
want a large sedan that can hold 6 people with room to spare and you want some
performance too, it's something to consider.  It's a good definition of
"Detroit Iron".
