I watched my mechanic just pry the PS pump and AC compressor just slightly
enough to take the tension off the bolts going through the end 'eyes' of
the turnbuckles, then removing said bolts.  After doing whatever work is
required, the original PS and AC belts can be replaced without fussing
with the tension.  I did it myself later on, and it was very easy. 

With the turnbuckles off the engine, it will be easier for you to remove 
the stripped rod or nut you apparently have.

The lock nuts are a bit tricky to get off, as one is reverse threaded.  
Therefore, both will unscrew in the _same direction_, so you could
very well be inadvertently tightening the nut(s).
