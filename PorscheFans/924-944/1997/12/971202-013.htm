Hello Mike & P-Fans
	OK - I don't want to beat a dead horse....But. 
	Mike I was just wondering if you checked - to make sure if you had the
proper CV Bolts? Since the CV-Joint thickness is different comparing the
inner & outer CV thickness. Did you check the CV-Joint bolt length? Maybe you
inadvertently mixed up the lengths of bolts? Maybe it was the last guy in
there? Just a thought.  
	I remember a friend of mine years ago with a GTi motor in his Scirocco - he
thought "what the hey" - I will just leave out those funny washers (a piece
of metal, two inches long, flat "C" shaped that works like a washer for every
two CV bolts) - his CV bolts backed out in a matter of weeks! Luckily he
pulled over when the vibration became noticeable - then he saw he had lost a
few CV-Joint bolts! 

PS:Remember when things seem to be bleak - look for the most obvious answer.
						Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
