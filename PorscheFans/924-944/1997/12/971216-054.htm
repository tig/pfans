Raymond,

Congratulations and it sounds okay.  The gauge should read better than 
4.5 at some rpm above idle.  I think it is either 2,000 or 3,000 rpm.  At 
idle it will drop, particularly when hot, but should hang at about 2 to 
3.  Someone will correct me!

Oil consumption specified by Porsche is not to exceed 1 liter every 600 
miles.  That seems a little excessive, but that is the specification.

I would try a fresh change of oil (I use Castrol GTX with good results in 
my normally aspirated car) and see if those numbers do not change.  I 
have seen different brands perform differently when it comes to 
consumption.

Keep your eye (two if you can afford it) on the fluid levels on a regular 
basis.  Of genuine interest is the coolant.  Turbos have a real hunger 
for head gaskets and will blow oil or exhaust into the coolant system.  
Symptoms are black oil blobs or Mr. Bubble in your coolant reservoir.  
Coolant can also be drawn into the oil pan.  You will see brown foam 
around the oil fill cap and dipstick if it does.  This is not to be 
confused with clear water condensation that builds up if you do not drive 
the car long enough to heat the oil up to running temperature.  Also, the 
oil level should increase if coolant does get into the engine.  This will 
cause severe damage to engine and must be corrected at the first sign of 
trouble.

Some people prefer synthetic oil for the Turbo.  I, for one, run Mobile 1 
in my Turbo and believe that it is a better oil for these cars.  The only 
problem is, synthetics can weep through gaskets and seals easily, 
particularly if conventional oil has been a steady diet in its past.  
However, I think the trade off of a few oil leaks is worth the better 
protection.  I have replaced most of my seals and gaskets now and very 
little oil escapes the bounds of my engine.

Use only approved Phosphate free coolant.  VW coolant is what Porsche 
uses.

If you are new to the water pumper Porsche vintage, you should be aware 
of the need to replace timing belt and balance shaft belt every 30,000 
miles (there are other service intervals for those belts in between the 
replacement intervals) and water pumps at about the 60,000 mile mark.  
The latter is more generally contested as to exact replacement mileage, 
but the former is a must!  If you lack records for the last belt 
replacement, I would have them replaced now and sleep well from that 
point on.  Broken or damaged belts have been known to break both the 
hearts and bank accounts of many owners (about $1,500).

Other than that, there are few problems you should endure with the Turbo 
cars.  They are robust, quick, and a joy to drive.  I wish you many happy 
miles and smiles!

Marv
