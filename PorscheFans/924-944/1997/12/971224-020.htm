Thanks for the opinions on the lights!  So far it seems
that the Hella H4s are the way to go.

Unfortunately, it is not that obvious.  (One of my
neighbors has some wipers on his VW that actually do
have a little wing riveted to the side of the wiper - like
I think you are thinking of.  In that case it is VERY
obvious!  :-)

Now that I've looked at a few more cars I think the
proper way is with the 'winged' side outwards from
the wiper arm.  Which means that I actually got it
right the first time.  Thinking a bit about structural
issues, centrifugal effects, etc it makes more sense.
But one would think that Bosch could have provided a
photo in the instruction sheet or on the package.  It
looks like the instruction sheet is simply from the regular
Micro Edge - which is symmetrical in appearance.
