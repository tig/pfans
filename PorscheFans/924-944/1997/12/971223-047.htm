Hello PORSCHE fans:
  About a month ago, I had been polling "the collective" to try and figure 
out why my 87' 944NA was being a real pill with hot starts. I would like to 
thank EVERYONE for their input. The cause would still be a mystery today 
without the collective knowledge this environment provides!! 
  Well, the DME relay was the problem!! I pulled it apart, and found a 
hairline solder joint fracture on the printed circuit board inside the relay.
 After reflowing this connection, and the others for good measure, the car 
starts perfectly hot or cold. It has been a month since the fix, and no 
signs of the problem returning!! THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE & HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!

....now, if I could only find someone willing to sell a used A/C compressor 
at a good price (that works), I would be a real "happy camper."

David,
      You posted that when performing a compression test that pressure 
readings should be very close to target on the first compression stroke? If 
not, then the rings are most likely worn? I thought it was normal for it to 
take a few compression strokes to reach the max value. I haven't checked our 
944's compression, but I did check the compression on our Jeep. I videotaped 
the gauge while cranking so that I could later watch the tape to take readings
from the gauge after each compression stroke. I then plotted pressure vs. 
stroke for each cylinder, all were within about 5 PSI of each other, and 
reached the desired max pressure within 3-4 compression strokes. Based on 
that, I had concluded that our Jeep engine was ok. I believe the Jeep Haynes 
manual said the readings should reach the desired pressure within a few 
compression strokes.. My compression gauge has a one way valve such that 
between compression strokes, the gauge holds pressure. If you have details as 
to the correct method for performing a compression test on engines, let me 
know..

  Also, without a leak down gauge (I assume this is just an air flow meter 
calibrated in some sort of units), is there any way to perform a leakdown 
test? I pressurized each cylinder on our NA 944 engine earlier this spring 
after I replaced the valve guide seals, and could hear air leaking out the 
exhaust valves but not the intake valves (Yes, I used the flywheel lock to 
keep the engine from turning at TDC for each cylinder) I was  using a sears 
portable 12v compressor I carry around in the car for the inflatable spare, so
I didn't reach huge pressures, I think it got to 25-30psi before the leakage 
past the exhaust valve matched the flow rate of the compressor thereby 
limiting the pressure. I do plan to re-build the head this winter..

Thanks for any advice anyone out there has!

Happy Holidays!
 Ezra

Hello Ezra & P-Fans
	Yes - Ezra, it is normal for the engine to take a few compression strokes
to reach the compression test max value, usually the gauge will reach 
its max reading in 4 - 5 revolutions. Remember to perform the test with 
a warm engine (oil temp of 80' C Min.), coil wire disconnected, and shorted 
to ground (to prevent coil/ignition ECU damage), throttle plate (WOT) open -
yes that last one will affect your readings! 
The first gauge reading should be about 75% of the Max end reading. All I 
meant to say that if your motor takes 8 compression strokes before you 
get that Max reading - something is worn out on your motor. In four to five
strokes, you should get the Max compression reading. 

	If your readings are low, or they take more than five strokes to reach 
Max, you might want to do a "wet compression test" or a "leak-down test". 

	A wet compression test is when you add a little amount (a table spoon
 full) of oil into the cylinder and then re- do a compression test. The oil
will 
help to temporarily seal any worn rings - boosting the measured results.
Little or no increase in the compression readings would indicate leakage
elsewhere, probably from valves, or a failing head gasket. 

	A leak down test - will use a special tester and a supply of compressed 
air, each cylinder is pressurized. The gauge will show a percentage of the 
air leaking out of that pressurized cylinder. Generally a good reading is from
0-10% leakage, 11%-15% marginal wear, and anything over 15-20% it's time 
to consider a rebuild. Snap-On sells leak down testers from about $160, I've 
seen some for even around $100 for a kit.

Hello P-Fans
	I saw the Mark's post and reminded me what a freind of mine who works 
for Volkswagen of America had told a few weeks ago. It seems that VW & 
Audi have gone to the CD Rom stuff too. Both for Service Manuals and parts
Fische. VW & Audi own the data but Robert Bentley, Inc (RB) owns the 
software. Apperently the CD ROM's have a core charge of $5,000 per each
CD ROM ! My freind has tried to copy it from his hard drive over to a
"freinds" 
to no avail !  There is some kind of tamper proof software that RB uses. 

I would think that eventually RB will release the service manuals and parts
films to the public - that's the good news. The bad news is that RB will 
probably take a few years for this to happen. By the way, RB is on the web 
they have a neat site just use a search engine. 

I've also come accross a Service and Parts CD ROM from Bell & Howell. 
At : http://www.bhauto.com/prodindex.htm
Bell & Howell does have a CD for Porsche among others - do not know the 
cost though.

Subject: Porsche Parts list on CD ROM - It's here

I was in the dealer's parts department yesterday and low and behold
there is a computer.  Further questioning confirmed that they indeed
 had the CD most of us have been waiting for.  I inquired as to how 
I would get one and 
was told "Dealers only and we have to pay $7000 a month for it".  
A quick call to PCNA confirmed that these CDs (and apparently the PC running
the software) are being leased to Porsche Dealers and the 
CDs themselves are not available to the public.  There is no plan 
today to make them available.  Hmmm...sounds like a call from 
every list member to PCNA may be in order.  Their
 number is 800-767-7243.

A non techie said at PCNA (Pia) that you have to have the
 whole system but the PC I saw was a standard pentium desktop.  
I doubt that PCNA would use a system that required a hardware
 encryption card and most people who would be subcontracted 
to build a CD like this for a company would make it self contained
 (any proprietary code would be contained on the CD); so I doubt 
this is any more than a smoke screen.

I am not done with the idea of taking my thinkpad up there and 
"checking it out".  I will keep you posted.

Hi P-Fans.  

Well, the combination of a few days off and the newly acquired S2 sitting in
my garage has me up to mischief.  I have been wanting to improve the throttle
tip in on the car, which, as usual with Porsches, is very gradual.  On my
1985.5, I made my own "throttle response cam" by simply cutting off the long
arm on the cam, extending the rounded slot for the cable with a small round
file, and relocating the roll pin that held the cable end.  It worked great
and I saved the $30 that Automotion and others want for the same idea.

On the S2, the throttle is opened via a series of bell cranks which attach to
an "L"  shaped lever arm that attaches to the intake manifold.  The arm has a
ball fitting on each end.  If you add a new ball fitting halfway up the arm on
the side to which the throttle cable attaches, you get a greater amount of
throttle opening action for the same relative amount of cable (and ultimately
pedal) travel.  I bought a new ball fitting that had a threaded end, drilled a
hole in the arm, and attached the fitting with a nylock nut.  With a little
adjustment of the cable, the geometry works out fine, with no binding.
Although this change does nothing to add horsepower, it makes the car feel
much more responsive, just like the throttle response cam does on the '85.

Thought I'd pass this along to the list.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
to all.
