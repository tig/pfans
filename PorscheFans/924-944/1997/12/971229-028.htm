IMHO, not as much as you would feel with a FWD-like chassis setup of the
Talon. In FWD sideways-mounted engine cars, solid poly mounts get rid of a
lot of, well, driveline slop. In a 924/44, there just isn't that much
drivetrain "windup," but if you wanted to kill it, solidify the entire
driveline, the rear axle mounts and the motor mounts. I suspect doing the
usually recommended 944 suspension bushing work would prove more useful for
lap times.

I have poly mounts on the Swift and it makes a world of difference. I also
can't drive the car longer than two hours without becoming jello. I've been
in a 944 with aluminium mounts and just plain would not consider them
unless they were the "unobtanium" advantage (which I doubt unless you had a
tied-to-suspension mounts roll-cage put in). People can go on and on about
how smooth the 944 motor feels, but with a solidly mounted drivetrain it
feels to me like the whole car is going to vibrate apart. (Then again,
there are those that feel a racecar should feel like a racecar... :-)

>3. What is a realistic weight that the 944T can be brought down to?

I've heard 2500 lbs is a good weight for a pure track car, but I think
people aren't all going to tell the whole truth, either. Firehawk S2's were
around 2750 lbs with minimal silliness, so the real question is how much
carbon fibre can you afford? :-)

What? No autocross?

Richard:

What sounds like a lifter ticking is often a fuel injector cycling.  Place a
finger on the side of each injector to feel the pulses.  One injector is
probably louder than the others and this is no problem.

Happy New Year to All . . . and be safe New Year's eve.  You're starting to
feel like family and I'd hate to loose any of you.

In a message dated 97-12-29 13:59:50 EST, you write:

<< iT IS THE CV JOINTS. I only hear the noise while in gear and esspecially in
first and second. I have noticed that the noise no so bad during a low speed
hard turn to the right or left. If it is the cv's what do you recemend and how
much should i expect to pay.   Could it be the transmission>???   Thanks
Bob...... >>


Just pull the axles, repack the CV joints, and install the axles on the
opposite sides.  Make sure the outer joints stay on the outside.  The spacer
or covering or something is slightly different sized between the inside and
outside, but I've heard people say they've put them in backwards with no ill
effect.

If you drive the car in and tell them to repack the CV joints and swap the
axles (the swapping axle thing should have NO effect on the price.  They're
out anyway.) I'm GUESSING at probably $100-$200, and I'm posting this to the
list instead of just responding to you to see if anyone has a better idea on
the cost.  I pulled mine off and brought them in and let my mechanic repack
them.   If I would have had a few extra hours, and lots more patience, I might
have repacked them myself.

P-fans:

There was a recent question about 17" wheels at a reasonable cost.  Here is
one data point:  I bought a set of Borbet C2 Turbo 17x7.5 and 17x9 wheels
through the Tire Rack to use as track wheels for my 92 968 coupe.  Quality
appears good and they fit well.  Cost was about $250 per wheel.  They are
visually identical to the original equipment 17 inchers on my 968 cab,
although I am sure they are heavier.  I know that a set of Fikses would be
preferable, but you couldn't get 4 for $1000!  I bet the Borbets would look
cool on a 951 or 944.
