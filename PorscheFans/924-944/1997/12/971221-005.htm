David,

>        I have been berated by a list member for asking an unreasonably =
high
>price for my S2. To substantiate his statement he cites a 1989 mint S2 =
with
>39000 miles that he has seen sell for 12000 and a mint 1989 Turbo S for
>14000.

While both of these claims may be true, I would take them with a grain of
salt.  How many "mint" cars have we all seen that were just a pile of
junk?  I know I've looked at a lot.  Statements like the above are
worthless without *all* the facts being known.

I recently corresponded with Bruce Anderson (kudos to Mr. Anderson for =
his
usual timely response) regarding the S2 I just purchased.  Bruce told me
that Excellence is doing another price survey for an upcoming issue and
that prices vary from a low of about $10,000 for a car in good condition,
to $15,700 for a car in excellent condition.  Cars that are in truly fine
shape with very low miles can command a 10% or more premium (like the one
I just purchased).

So, as you can see, your asking price is well within the reasonable =
range.
The old phrase "you get what you pay for" generally holds true.  As an
example, my son Scott paid over $20K for his 37K mile '89 944 Turbo in
August 1996.  We knew the complete history of the car, the shop were it
had been serviced, and felt very comfortable with the seller.  Many on
this list would consider that an outrageous price.  To us it has been
worth every penny and I would actually consider it a bargain because the
car has been nearly flawless, requiring only  replacement of one small
water hose.  It is driven daily and is a dream.

Cheers,
