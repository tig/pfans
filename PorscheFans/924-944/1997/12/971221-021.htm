Bill razzed him with:

Well today I put my girlfriends mountain bike in the back of the 944,
drove with the windows down, top off, and smiling faces through the
worse sunshine storm I've ever seen in my life.  If was horrible, I tell
you...blue skies, that obnoxious sunshine and warm air through my
hair...it was terrible.  So we get to my house, unload her bike and I
grab mine and we're off for a bike ride through the golf course and
local nature trail.  Oh, by the way, we wore shorts and were kinda
sweaty afterwards....Damn sunshine.  So, see how lucky you are to not
have to deal with all of this hell? Aren't you glad you live up north?
