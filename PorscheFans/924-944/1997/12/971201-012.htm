Yea, it's a real PIA for me because in order to lose as little work as
possible I need belt work done first thing in the AM. That means I have to
stay overnight in New Orleans just to get belt adjustment. However I can
think of worse cities to have to spend the night in. I usually leave the
car at the dealer then take a hotel shuttle to the French Quarter-great
food, great women to look at(no touching), casino gambling. Yea, it's a
real PIA.
