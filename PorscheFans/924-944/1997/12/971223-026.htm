I am having a problem getting the engine fans to work on my 82 931.  I
have the factory manual with wiring diagram, bit I don't see both fans on
there and the wire colors are different.  The PO had them hard wired to a
switch and the battery, but I have since removed the wiring.
 
I am also wondering when each fan is supposed to come on.  I really want
to wire them so they come on in tandem, since I live in sunny and hot Fla.
 
Please write me directly.
 
Thanks
 
PS Have a happy holiday season
