The 924 Porsche is looked upon as a set child, but with a few minor 
changes be can make it run hard. 
1. a throttle body will give you about 10% more horsepower.
2. Porting the manifold will give you about 5% more w\TB.
3. headers will give you from 5% to 8% depending on fuel adjustments.
4.lighten the flywheel will increase torque off the line noticably.
5.Port, polish, and mill the head will give you about 15 to 20% more 
horse power.
6. If you want to get crazy you can forge 90mm pistons at 11:5.1 
compression ratio.
 
All this in reality translates to is 0 to 60 in 5.8 seconds flat and 
that will beat most porsches out there, I know because I do it all the 
time. This is from a normally aspirated 924 with some performance 
inhancements. It also likes great going by as a cabriolet!!!!! WOW!
                                                    Keep the faith 924 
owners,
                                                    LARRY BRENT

Well, I have received my first order of new part from vertex, which was
definately the price champ in my bidding war. I had specified all parts to be
oem if possible. I'm happy to report that everything is pretty much as
represented, not porshce brand name except on a few things, but all the
bearings, ignition stuff etc. appears to be oem, reputable german manufactured
stuff. I splurged on the "new" water pump, which does actually appear to be
new, though I have heard that genuine porshce now supplies rebuilt units. I do
have a question on the timing balance belts, though. The timing belt is made
by TRW under license by Federal Mogul of Switzerland. The balance belt by
Flennor of Germany. They are both in the box, and look perfectly legit, and I
suspect they may be the same source that porsche uses, but does anyone have
any experience. They are plenty cheap enough even to get from porsche at a
discount, (ie MCGill) but I see no reason to think that the porsche branded
ones would be in any way superior. They certainly do not have a reputation for
being dependable. Anyone have any experiences with these belts, good or bad,
or knowledgeable on what maker the current porsche brand belts are?
