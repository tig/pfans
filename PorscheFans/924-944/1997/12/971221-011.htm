Graham,

Engine life is a bit like the life span of a human.  It is difficult to 
predict, however, one prediction that does carry weight is that the 
better care you take, the better the odds of a long life.

One thing that might give you a better clue would be to have a pre-sale 
inspection done.  You could pose the same question to the mechanic, he 
should be able to concentrate on the motor.  A Compression and leak down 
test come to mind.

One of our list members has a 944 with over 300,000 miles on it.  To my 
knowledge, the motor is original.  A well cared for engine should easily 
exceed 200,000 miles and more likely beyond the 250,000 mile mark with 
out major service.

The fact that you have documentation on this car is a real plus.  Oil 
change intervals are a good barometer.

The 944S engine does require more judicious maintenance than the standard 
944.  Beside the regular oil changes the 16 valve head is very critical 
and detailed attention must be paid to the timing belt (and its 
associated components such as rollers, cogs, and water pump) and the cam 
chain tensioner.  Belts should be replaced every 30,000 miles, water pump 
every 60,000 (there is controversy on this point), and the cam chain 
tensioner every 60,000 miles with periodic inspection in between.  If all 
this is done, the likelihood that the engine will be a source of wallet 
drain should be low.

The 944S is a rare and sweet car, but it needs a little more care and 
feeding.  For your efforts it will reward you with many miles of fun.
