Hi - these sort of suggestions have been shot down before, but I'll try
again......

How about S2 owners agreeing to include a keyword (S2) in the subject field
 of their questions/answers to the list
(see example from Dave Greenburg below).
I have trouble dealing with all my EMAIL input, and while I find a lot of
the Turbo/Racing/Early 944 discussion interesting,
it would be more useful if I could search for S2 specific information first
 for my daily driver......
If you are an S2 owner and agree - do it, if not, don't !!

BTW - Dave - did you have to remove your steering wheel to pull the dash to
 change the bulbs ?  Did you use bulbs of
original wattage etc (i.e. why are they brighter ??).


Subject: misc S2

Pfans:

        1. My mechanic checked the rattling sound that I thought could be
my torque tube going bad or the typical tranny noise, and found that one of
the bolts on the collar was very loose and he tightened it and I now have a
very pleasingly quiet car.

        2. Changed the bulbs behind the dash and have beautiful light,
enough to make the rheostat useful.

        3. Just got a chip from George B. on consignment and it seems to
help. The car seems to rev mor freely and has greater torque throuhout the
power curve. I don't know about the top end. This is a very subjective
judgment and it's possible there's no difference but the difference I wish
there would be. Is there a place in south Florida where I could get the car
dynoed?
