I recently purchase a full boost chip from a guy that makes them. I
wanted that 0-60 low end torque built up a bit. (get side ways .. you
know .. hehe). I think he takes trade-in but I am not sure if that is
just for his chips or any chips. I am sure he would give you a good deal
either way. He also Garuantees his chips. Although if you are going to
use the topend you might blow the stock head gasket(maybe not). I dont
have enough room around here to use topend nor the guts to do so. If you
need more info e-mail me direct.
