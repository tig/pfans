Farzaan and Chris R.,  It was on the market 5 weeks ago in Port Moody. I
saw it in the BUY and SELL newspaper, raced out to see it( I live in
White Rock) on a dark rainy night to see it. The seller said he would
hold it until morning so I could see it in daylight. Nice car, gold,blk.
leather, A/C, cruise, 5spd., Nice guy, Good maint. records, Messy
Divorce. I agonised all day over it, my wife threatened another messy
divorce(I spend way too much time in the garage already). I let it go
but I phoned him back much later out of curiosity. He said it took 2
weeks to sell!  No Kidding.    Dave C.

=0A=0ADear P-Fans=0A=09The O2 Sensor only works or feeds into the ECU (El=

=09When there is a vacuum leak or an exhaust leak before O2 sensor, the O=
2=0Asensor can see a lot of extra un metered air, the ECU reads this as a=
 lean=0Amixture (when it is not) and adds more fuel - by increasing the i=
njector duty=0Acycle. If there is a  vacuum leak, the O2 sensor  sees =93=
extra=94 air and ECU=0Awill richen the fuel mixture. When there is a exha=
ust leak, between=0Acompression pulses, some un-metered air is sucked int=
o the exhaust and travels=0Aon down to the O2 sensor. Same effect - The E=

Hello Pierre & P-Fans
	You can use Meguir's Clear Pastic Cleaner(#M-1708) and Clear Plastic Polish
(#M-1008). $20 for both in a kit (#MPLAS99). You can order direct from
Meguir's @ 800-545-3321 or from Imparts ect...

					Enjoy, DavidJalai@aol.com
