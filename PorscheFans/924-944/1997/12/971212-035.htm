Howdy,  an NGK engineer, a good friend of mine actually, wrote the following
for the DSM list.  I always find something interesting in what he writes,
so I'll pass this one on to my 924/944/968 family:

>Subject: Spark plug thread lubricants - NGK's perspective
>Message-ID: <#10>
>
>I am writing to comment on a letter that Mr. Louis Haddock posted on12/3/97.
>His letter made some very interesting points.  I was rather flattered to see
>someone actually pays that much attention to his spark plugs.  I have always
>stressed the importance of the spark plug, and Mr. Haddock understands this.
>
>Mr. Haddock referred to detailing his ground electrode by forming it.  I
>suggest that he experiment with some of the NGK platinum type spark plugs
>(BPR6EVX).  The VX type uses a smaller center electrode diameter along with a
>tapered ground electrode.  Both characteristics work to improve low-end and
>upper-end ignitability.
>
>I agree with most everything Mr. Haddock describes.  Especially the following
>points:
>1. Always install plugs into a cold engine.
>2. Use a torque wrench while installing.
>
>One element that I must oppose, however, is the recommendation to use anti-
>seize or motor oil while installing the spark plugs.  NGK does not support
>either of these practices.  NGK feels that the zinc-chromate plating that is
>applied to each spark plug is sufficient to avoid seizure of the spark plugs
>into the head.
>
>I would never use motor oil on the threads since I have seen cases where
plugs
>actually baked the oil and seized so badly that the spark plugs snapped in
>half when the user attempted to remove them.  Granted that guy did not torque
>his plugs tightly enough to give them a nice cooling path to disperse the
heat
>into the head walls, but I would not risk it.  The anti-seize is a scary
thing
>as well.  NGK fears that customers can easily over-torque the plugs when
using
>anti-seize.  The anti-seize changes the contours of the threads enough to
>possibly stretch the threads or strip the threads in your head if slightly
>over-torqued.  If you plan to use anti-seize, the tightening torque for a
14mm
>plug into an aluminum head is 10-20 Nm.  Without the anti-seize, NGK
>recommends a tightening torque of 25-30 Nm (18.4-22.1 lb-ft).  NGK recommends
>that the engine manufacturers avoid the anti-seize as well.  I have also
heard
>rumors that the anti-seize can accelerate the dielectric breakdown of a plug
>if it contacts the insulator.
>
>In Mr. Haddock's case, it seems that he has had luck with his use of thread
>lubricants.  I am not saying these products are not fit for spark plugs, I am
>just saying that NGK has taken their own anti-seizure measures (with the
zinc-
>chromate plating).  Then again, not everyone changes out his or her plugs
>every 10,000 miles.  That plug replacement interval may be pushing the limits
>of these soft aluminum heads.  That is why it is refreshing to hear that Mr.
>Haddock uses his torque wrench.  If everyone were to maintain that change
>interval, I suggest you watch the tightening torques very closely.  That
>change rate would also provide me with some sweet profit-sharing checks.
>
>Thanks for listening.
