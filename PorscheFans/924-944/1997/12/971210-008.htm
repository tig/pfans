Hi everyone
,
I need to replace the tires on my 89' 951 since the current ones probably
won't get me through the next German winter.  Currently I am running Toyo
Proxes Z1s (which I have been happy with for the most part).

First of all, does anyone have a suggestion for my next set?  I have always
been happy with BFG TAs on my 914, so I figured that might be a good choice.
The car is used for aggressive daily driving with some fairly extended
periods of Autobahn travel at 140 MPH.

Also, I am here in Germany with the Air Force and thus could buy my tires on
base or order them through Tire Rack.  Are there any fellow military/gov't
folks out there with suggestions or tales of experience?  How long does it
normally take to get tires from Tire Rack and what is a rough shipping cost
(using the USPS.)

Thanks,
Tim
