I own an '87 944na w/ 110,000 miles.  When the engine is running I can
hear a ticking sound similar to that of bad lifter knocking on a Chevy.
(sorry, until three weeks ago, that's all i worked on.)  

Any other possibilities?  

Are the lifters on Porsches adjustable?  Possible to do myself or a
dealer job?  What's required?

I don't know who to address this too.  The author's name and address was
missing from the letter.

I too presently have a ticking noise coming from the rear of my '86 944 Turbo
(951).  My noise used to appear when making harder than normal left turns.  My
noise disappears when I depress the clutch pedal.  The noise used to be
intermittent.  Now it is present all of the time.

My mechanic listened intently as I drove in counter clockwise circles around
him.  We still don't know what the problem is.  He surmised that it may be
that the rear wheel bearings have dried up.  I hope that is it, as I fear it
may be coming from the trans-axle.

We plan on changing the entire suspension this winter.  I will find out what
the noise is, but perhaps not for another month or so.  If anyone can help
please let me know.

I would also appreciate your experienced suggestions/opinions on the following
upgrades (?) we have planned for this winter:

Welded in roll cage w/ removable side door beams.  Plan on using a RaceTec
cage.

Swapping out the suspension from a 968.  New Koni double adjustable shocks w/
coil-overs in the rear.  (Already have factory 30 mm front and 19 mm
adjustable rear sway bars)

New set of Fiske wheels w/ Michelin Pilot's (17").

Pulling the motor.   Porting/polishing the intake manifold, replacing the
rings, copper head gasket (to deal w/ the mass flow kit presently on the car).
Pressure sensing in liu of the mass flow if the technology matures before the
car goes back togther.  New turbo... looking for one that is both more
efficient and of higher capacity.

Porsche Big Red brakes on the front.  Re-locate the front calipers to the
rear.  Factory pads to replace the squeaky Pagid green pads I have now.

I don't plan on racing this car.  I plan on continuing my auto-X fun and
participating in driver's ed events.

ALL suggestions and recommendations are welcome and appreciated.
