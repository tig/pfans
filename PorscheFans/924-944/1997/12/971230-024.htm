It is called an Impala SS.  At least some of these were loaded
with cop stuff.  Kind of like the scene in the Blues Brothers.
To paraphrase:

	(Dan Akroid picks up John Belushi from prison in a
	trashed out ex-police car.)

	John B: So where'd you get this crummy car?

	(Lights cigarette.  Throws cigarette lighter out window.)

	Dan A: Its got cop brakes, cop steering, cop engine,
	cop suspension, ...

There are some Impala SS web pages around which I've stumbled
across while surfing.

Hello Craig & P-Fans=0A=0A=09I suspect that you have a vacumm leak. First=
 inspect all the intake plumbing,=0Arubber connection boots, hoses, inter=
cooler connections, ect. The rubber=0Athrottle body does wear out as the =
motor mounts ages and lowers the engines=0Aheight. On some 951=92s the bl=
ack rubber boot from the turbo=92s inlet to the air=0Aflow meter will som=
etimes devellop a tear or crack due the heat from the=0Aturbo. There is a=
lso a out put rubber boot from the turbo to inspect as well.=0ARemove the=
 boot and inspect. Look=0A for oil spray evidence to track down any loose=

951 - Weird Stallining (Help!)=0A=0AMerry Christmas to all!=0AWhile doing=
 last minute shopping yesterday, I encountered a problem with=0Amy '86 95=
1.  I started the car in the parking lot, noticing the idle was=0Arough (=
car was still warm though).  I attempted to back out and found=0Athat if =
I pushed the gas pedal more than 1/8 inch, the car would=0Astumpble and s=
tall.  I rolled back, and put the car in first only to=0Afind the same th=
ing.  I was able to get the car driving by teasing the=0Agas pedal - but =
the car had the acceleration of a school bus.  I shut=0Adown the engine, =
and checked all the basic connections under hood etc=0A(yes, there was pl=
enty of fuel:-))  When I started the car up again, the=0Aproblem was gone=
..  On the short trip home, the problem started again. =0ADriving at 40 mp=
h, suddenly I had to take my foot off the gas in order=0Ato keep from sta=

..  I've started and driven the car around home several=0Atimes, and the p=
roblem hasn't shown up again.  The car has been rock=0Asolid for the past=
 year, and this is rather frustrating b/c I cannot get=0Athe problem to r=

 the rear are good, and my best guess is some electrical=0Ashort in the f=
