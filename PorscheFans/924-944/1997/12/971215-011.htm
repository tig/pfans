Does this happen only when you have the fan off, ie the 4speed fan is
turned off?  Is so, I would guess that the little fan which resides right
in front of the windshield (under a plastic cover) and is supposed to run
at all times (as long as the key is turned) has expired. You should be
able to hear a faint hum from the fan and feel some air on the center
vents when you turn the key but have no radio or anything else on. 

I suspect that when your car is moving, the air gets pushed in the car and
flows out the back, when the car is stopped there is no positive pressure
on the front forcing air in the car.  The little fan which I think died in
your car maintains airflow even when the car is stopped.  (another reason
why the 944 is so neat, this also allows you to engage the A/C with the
fan off).
