For sure!  If you take a car with a roof and remove it you had better
reinforce the chassis, or the chassis will sag.  Compare the gap of the
doors at the top and bottom.

Of course it will.  Maybe on a 924 it might not hurt value, but if you take
a 951 and chop the top you had better be ready to see a drop in value.
*IF* you can find the *right* buyer you might do fine, but don't count on it.

Says who?  Compare a Ferrari Daytona Coupe to a Ferrari Daytona Coupe
converted to a covertible.

A *huge* difference when they are done at the factory.

Maybe to some, not me.

Could you support this with some data of multiple car sold for this price
(or around there)?  I doubt it.  The market for custom cars is VERY small.
Investing thousands into a Honda might increase the value in some small
market, but in the real world, you may lose money.  If you decide to do
this, do fool yourself into believing that you'll be improving the value of
the car.  IF they improved in value so easily, don't you think this company
would just slap a bunch together and sell them and make huge profits?  

IMHO, buy a factory Porsche roadster if you want a convertible.  Far less
headaches, great quality, and better resale value.  They were built to do
this, a coupe wasn't

Here is an idea I have been considering. Since the dash caps seem to be too
cheesy looking (I should not use that word) and recovering required the hassle
of taking out the old dash, I was thinking a good compromise might be to get
the dash cap and then recover it with leather or thin stretchy vinyl. It might
look better than the plastic cap and save the invevitable hassle of getting
the old dash out. Hard to say how well the caps fit, though, especially with
the extra covering, but it seems like it might work. I have noticed, by the
way that the so-called black interior on my 924-S is actually a very dark
brown. This was popular with german industrial design types back then, before
they broke down and went to real black. Try looking at it at night by flash
light if you don't believe it.
