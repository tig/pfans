Hi Fans,
Well, I was pretty excited to upgrade my beuatiful '87 944 to new
Yokohama 225/50/16s on the rear axle(as recommended in the owners
manual)yesterday. The previous owner had 205/55/16s on there, and now I
think I know why.
What I thought was the 'sound of death', turned out to be far worse.
Careful inspection shows that my driver side rear fender well is rubbing
the outer lip of my brand new tire, and has placed a nice groove in it. 
This only occurs when I take fast turns, or cruise over a rise in the
road. 

The cause is as follows:
The damned tire sticks out about 3/16" farther than the passenger side
rear tire,(as measured w/ a level) and that is JUST enough to cause my
problem. I took off both rear tires and measured the spacers. (Both are
3 3/16" measured from brake disk) Neither fender has been 'rolled'. 
Ironically, the driver side (bad side) fender lip sits 1/4" higher than
the good side at its apex.  Shocks are good, the one tire just sticks
out a hair too far to allow the fender to 'clear' it.   

My question: (took awhile...)
What can I do ?? I would hate to go back and buy another set of thinner
tires (205s)again. (Talk about throwing one's money away over the
holidays !!) Can I mount a slightly thinner spacer on the one side ??
There's not much fender to roll, and I think that would require a
repaint, which I just had done.

Any experiences or suggestions would really be appreciated, as I now
have to drive my Plymouth Turismo because I don't want to 'shave' my
Yokos anymore.  (I don't even know if the one is still good (safe) at
this point...)

Thanks,
Neil  (Happy Holidays from me and my Plymouth !!)
