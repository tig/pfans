Greg, there are two things you need to move out of the way.  The first 
is a black plastic tube which surrounds the linkage as it passes 
through the rear bell housing.  I just push it forward.

The second item is getting the linkage itself out of the way as you 
lower the transmission out of the car.  The workshop manual tells you 
do disconnect the linkage at the shift lever (E-clip), rotate it, then 
push it forward 30 cm.  I have never been able to make this work, I 
cannot even it to move forward past the immediate recess in which the 
lever sits.

Instead, I leave the linkage connected at the lever, but pull the lever 
back so that it is at least pulling the intermediate shaft a little 
forward.  At the transmission, you need to tilt the transmission as you 
lower it, perhaps 30-odd degrees.  This is done so that you can move 
the transmission back while clearing the spare tire well.  It also 
helps to move the transmission a little to the left at its back, since 
this too gives you a little clearance of the wheel well.

The transmission case has a machined hole in a boss at its bottom, 
along the "keel".  My theory is that this hole is used to locate the 
transmission on whatever tool the factory uses to install it, and so is 
its centre of gravity.  The latter turns at least turns out to be the 
case, and locating a floor jack's cup dead under this hole will make 
R&R fairly straightforward.

So, the trick is to centre the transmission on the floor jack, slowly 
lower it, tilt it back (and to the left) to clear the spare tire well, 
and above all avoid hanging it on the linkage.  The later is important, 
because you can damage the linkage.  Keeping lowering and tilting until 
you have the rear of the case clear of the well.  At that point, pull 
it back and free of the linkage.

Sorry for the complicated explanation.  Kind of like dancing, it's easy 
when you've done it but all but impossible to describe with words.

Kevin
