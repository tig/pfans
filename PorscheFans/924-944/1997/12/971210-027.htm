Hey Nick,   I`ll throw a few bits of info your way and hope that I don`t
get blasted by the purists. My 1986 944 n.a. was designed to run on 87
octane fuel( easier marketing to the massive North  American audience)
Because of this, and the relatively high compression of the engine,
Porsche had to limit cylinder pressures to avoid engine knock and the
production of oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust.( hardly your concern as
there is no damn oxygen above 7000ft. anyway, this is why god gave us
turbos). They did this by running a very conservative spark timing
program and by significantly retarding the camshaft timing. The intake
valve on my car is not opening until 2 degrees ATDC!(stock)
 This severely limits the amount of air and fuel the piston can draw
into the cylinder. Before I go any further, 3 points: (1) The DME in my
car was shipped already set at the highest advance point.(stock) (2)
Moving the reference stud advances the timing across the entire map. 92
octane fuel resist knock better than 87 across the entire timing map.
(3) Engines that run lean(any engine with a functioning O2 sensors
typically regulate mixtures at 14.7 : 1) tend to respond well to more
advance bcause it lessens the requirement for enrichment. Maximum
horsepower is achieved at a fuel ratio of about 12.5 : 1.  There is an
altitude switch in 944`s shipped to theUSA. I believe this switch
advances timing 2 degrees and reduces injector pulse width (fuel
delivery) when the vehicle gets over a preset altitude. I`m sure 7000ft.
qualifies. Fuel delivery is reduced obviously because your poor little
engine is trying to pull oxygen out of thin air. Someone may sell a cam
sprocket that allows you to advance the cam timing, this will definitely
improve cylinder filling. I filed the keyway in my cam sprocket and
shimmed the cam over so that I am now running it at 4 degrees BTDC.
opening. A very noticeable improvement! If you do this , the process can
be somewhat confusing, just remember, you want to advance the cam in
relation to its sprocket. This will have no effect on ignition timing as
the cap and rotor simply distribute the spark, they do not trigger the
coil. The 944 has a throttle switch, (TPS on the 951) the Wide Open
Throttle contacts reduce spark advance and increase injector pulse width
when you have your foot planted. These are two things you don`t want to
happen at 7000ft. Clip the wire coming from the full throttle contact.
On my 944 this is a white wire(one of three coming out of the throttle
switch.    I`m sure to think of something else, but in the meantime Good
Luck!   Dave C.
