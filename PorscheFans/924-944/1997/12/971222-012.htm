Good morning all,

I would like to throw this situation out to the collective and see what
kind of ideas you all have.  My (modified) 1982 924 is burning oil.  I have
verified that the valve stem seals are shot by running up to 4k rpm in 4th,
then just letting the engine braking slow it down, right before stall, I
hit the gas, big puff of blue.  OK, so I need seals.  It also smokes really
bad under hard full throttle acceleration.  This situation would point to
rings, but after performing a compression test and getting 180 psi (+/- 1
psi) in each cylinder, I am looking for answers.

Could the valve seals be the whole problem?  Could I have bad oil blow by
on the rings and still have excellent compression?

Changing the subject, I had an opportunity to drive an '83 928 last week.
Needless to say, I want one.  I realize it does not handle like our
beloved, but what a motor!!!  I was doing 70 on the freeway, hit the gas,
next thing I know I am at 120.  Now don't start flaming me, I love all
Porsche's, and hope to own many different models in my (hopefully) long
Porsche owning life.  Now if I can just get that vasectomy without my wife
knowing............
