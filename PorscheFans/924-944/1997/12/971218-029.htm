Don Istook,
     There are plenty of machine shops around that have the necessary tools
to resiliconize the 944 cylinders. However, there are very few that have
actual experience with the process. A couple of years ago, I obtained a
used 944 engine to use as a platform for a 2.8L conversion. When I
disassembled the engine, the cylinders weren't in as good a condition as I
had hoped. There was a very small ridge at the top of the cylinder travel
that I just couldn't take a chance on. With the amount of money I'd have
invested in the 2.8L, it just didn't feel right. I looked around for a long
time before I found anyone who had any experience with the resiliconizing
process. At the time (about 8 months ago), I was living in New Jersey and
located a machinist in Livingston, NJ who had a lot of experience doing the
job. I took the block to him and had it honed .020" over and resiliconed. I
haven't put the engine into service yet but, I was truly impressed by the
work he did. At present, the bottom end is assembled and I'm waiting on
the Raceware head studs and  head gasket to come in. I had the bottom end
assembled at a local Porsche shop and the mechanic there commented on the
machine work. He measured and inspected the cylinders before assembling the
bottom end and said they were perfect.
                 I'll keep you posted as to the service I get out of
resiliconized cylinders once the new engine is installed. I considered
installing steel sleeves in the cylinders but, the thing that made me
uncomfortable about it is the differences in the way steel and aluminum
expand and contract with changing temperature. I know a lot of 944 owner's
have used this with great success but, a few have had problems when it
hasn't been done correctly.  Many people wonder why 944 engines with their
aluminum cylinders are able to last for up to 200,000 or more. The reason
is that the silicon process, when done correctly, is actually harder than a
steel cylinder. I been told that Mercedes Benz has started using the same
process on some of their new engines. If you'd like to talk to the guy who
did my machine work, his name is Rich Jacksic. His phone number is
201-533-1495.  He has done some sleeving as well as resiliconizing . Give
him a call and see which he prefers.

Happy Holidays
Clark Fletcher
