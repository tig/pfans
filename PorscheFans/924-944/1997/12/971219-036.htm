And for anyone who cares... I had all the belts, rollers, and tensioners
replaced on my newly acquired S2 yesterday.  Now I can sleep well and =
know
that everything is new.  Actually, the belts looked quite good and
probably would have lasted thousands of miles longer, but after 8 years
who can tell?  Some of the rollers/tensioners were starting to get a bit
loose and one of them was making some noise on startup, so I just had =
them
all replaced.  I will probably do the same at 60K and change the water
pump then, assuming it lasts that long.  I think I can afford the 2 cents
per mile cost of these parts, which were all genuine Porsche.

Has anyone on the list installed a 944 NA camshaft in a 951?  Does anyone have
the "numbers" on lift and duration for either?

I'd appreciate any info.

TIA,
Jeff Fortenbery

 Jim,
 
 I don't know who makes them but they are different compounds and you
 will definitely be able to tell the difference. I have a set of each
 on the two BMW and I just don't like the feel of the Mintex. Try NOPI
 in Atlanta. They had the MM pads the last time I checked.

And don't forget Jason Burkett at Paragon Products.  I got a set of the Repco
MMs from him recently, as cheap as you'll find them anywhere, and never any
BS!
