Mark,
Aftermarket boost gauges usually read manifold pressure. I currently
have an Autometer installed on my 951. I placed a small tee in the line
that is used for detecting knock in the engine, then ran copper tobing
to the gauge. It does not matter how you raise your boost as long as you
use a mechanical gauge. (Porsche uses an electric gauge as stock on our
951's)
When at idle the gauge functions as a  vaccum gauge. Off idle it reads
actual boost pressure in the intake manifold.
