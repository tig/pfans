Barry,

Yes, a handful were imported to America as 1991 models with the same 250 
hp motor and M030 Turbo S fittings.  About 500 examples were built as a 
last tribute to the marque with about 250 slated for the U.S. market.  I 
do not know how many really have been imported this side of the pond.

You can read about this car in Excellence magazine, issue number 29, 
October, 1991, page 54.  Back issues are available for about $5 by 
calling 1-415-382-0580.

Essentially, it is exactly like the Turbo S, but has the Cabriolet top, 
and the premium 10 speaker sound system is missing in the photographs I 
have seen.  Interior resembles the Cabriolet, except for the 180 mph 
speedo and boost gauge, as does the exterior, but the performance is 
almost as good as the coupe version (drag from the top limits upper end 
performance to about 156 mph).

Good luck finding one, but if you do I am sure we want to hear all the 
juicy details!

Marv
