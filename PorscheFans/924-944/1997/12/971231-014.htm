According to my owner's manual ('86 951) the spec for oil pressure at
normal operating temperature is "approximately 4 bar" at 5000rpm.  It
then goes on to explain that this may drop to 0.5 bar (that's not a
typo) at idle without indicating a problem.  My gauge generally reads
around 3 bar at idle and is pegged (or just a hair below 5 bar) at
2500rpm.

Someone asked about airbag removal on 944's, and work is is very slow today...

I have taken the SRS systems out of several race cars, and disconnected the
system on my street car. 

DISCLAIMER: removal or tampering of the SRS system is specifically not
recomended by the author.  

The SRS control unit is configured to interrupt the power to the DME relay in
order to shut the engine down in the event of SRS deployment. The simple
removal of the pyrotechnic devices, while leaving the control unit intact and
wired, will result in the Achtung! light remaining illuminated, and can also
present a dangerous safety issue (see below). 
 
In the the interest of safety, here is the electrical end of this project:

1)Disconnect the  battery

2)Find the 7 Pin Airbag Plug that connects the Siemens SRS control unit with
the dash wiring harness. This unit is located under the passenger side of the
dash almost on top of the glove box. It is the only orange colored control
unit on the car. The plug is on a short lead out of the control and is round. 

3) Disconnect the 7 pin connector at the SRS computer . This is how the 7 pins
are utilized: 

          7- yellow/black,   Airbag warning lamp

          6- Unused

          5- white,  buzzer relay, seat belt

          4- black /red,  supply for DME relay
	
          3- black/white,  central electric N48

          2- red/black,  central electric KL50

          1- brown,   ground 

4) To allow the car to run without the SRS control unit and to disable the SRS
portion of the Achtung light,  jump the harness wires connected to pin 4 with
pin 3. I recommend using solder and heat shrink tubing, as this is a critical
connection which will stall the car if it should fail. (great place to tap in
a hidden kill switch)

5) Remove the control unit from the car. Remove the sensors located in each
kick panels (2). This may require the purchase of a special serrated socket
tool to remove the anti-tamper nuts that secure the units to their mountings.
Persistant use of a vise grips or needle nose pliers can sometimes work in
place of the socket.

******WARNING*******
The control unit and sensors should be removed or the wiring clipped from
them. This is to prevent someone down the road from attempting to connect the
system to a possibly activated SRS unit.  Maybe that shunt on the track or
that slight parking tap may have activated the units?  Make sure the chance of
this happening is zero. Remove the control and sensors. 

I know first hand that track use CAN activate the SRS system on these cars (no
contact or off track driving is required) . Azide burns, destroyed windshields
and dashboards are no fun.....

Steve R
