Howdy,

A correction.  The higher rate FPR regulator on the Weltmeister chips came
on the "S" model chips only and it was there from day one.

To return your car back to stock, you must first find out what boost
control method is used.

Boost bolt:
If it's the boost bolt, the bolt on the intercooler piping right above the
air filter box will have a few holes soldered shut and one drilled a small 
amount (new style) or the bolt will have a weber jet inside the middle with
a threaded wall (old style).  To return that to stock, just get a new boost
bolt which will have much larger holes that have no solder, etc.

Wastegate Shim:
I don't know if you can see it from outside???  I would probably look at
this as my last resort, and I don't think anyone else except Weltmeister
used the shims so the chip might tell the story there.  To return to stock,
remove the shim.

Drilled cycling valve:
There is an easy way to test if your cycling valve is drilled.  Disconnect
power to it, and then go for a WOT [:)] run.  If you are smiling, the car
has a drilled cycling valve, if you feel like a Civic could blow your
doors off, you have a stock cycling valve (the computer cannot bleed any
pressure from the intake pressure hose because the valve has no power so
it will be 0.2bar [1.2bar absolute]).

Bleeder valve:
I ran into this one on a car I worked on recently.  He just had a dial-a-
boost jobby in line with the piping coming off the intercooler pipe and
was installed between the IC piping and the cycling valve.  Just remove
it out of the line to stop that and ensure that there are no leaks in that
line, from the IC to the cycling valve.

I can't think of any others.  I'm sure others will chime in if I forgot
anything.

If this is your first chip change, have fun with the computers!  Yes, they
really do go in like that configuration, and yes, the boards do eventually
seperate :)

Farzaan.
