To 924S and 944n.a. Porschefans,     Here are some modifications/ideas
that should help to improve the performance of your normally aspirated
2.5L. These are things I`ve done on my 1986 944 and have been quite
happy with the results. Please be aware that these modifications may
cause your car to fail an emissions test (mine still passes)and could
reduce your engine and drivetrain life due to increased stress on
related components.

(1) Use high octane fuel and advance the reference dowel 5 degrees on
the flywheel.You can do this by drilling and tapping the flywheel
approx. half an inch ahead of the old location. The new dowel must have
exactly the same assembled height as the old location and must be
threadlocked. You can change the amount of advance if you like. There is
obviously about one degree of advance for each 1/10th of an inch along
the flywheel. This will give you a significantly noticeable power
increase. The O2 sensor will trim the fuel delivery to suit demand. The
nice thing about this mod. is that you retain the stock DME timing
profile,
which I believe enables an easier pass at the emissions test.

(2) Advance the camshaft 6 degrees in relation to its sprocket. I did
this by filing the sprocket`s keyway 1 milimeter and shimming the other
side of the key. There is probably indexed sprockets you can buy that
make this task a lot easier. Don`t just jump the sprocket one tooth on
the timing belt, this is too much (18 deg./tooth) change. Remember, 1
deg. at cam is 2 deg. at the crank.  This change will improve cylinder
filling as the stock cam timing is very retarded to reduce emissions.

(3) In the stock configuration, the full throttle switch reduces timing
4 to 8 degrees when your right foot is planted. I have cut the white
wire going to the full throttle contact. I now use this contact to
ground the armature of a relay that switches the DME coolant sensor
input to a fixed 1.3K resistor. This pulls the DME out of closed loop
and tells it, the engine is 100 degrees F. If the engine is in closed
loop (DME reading 113 deg. or more) the O2 sensor will trim fuel
delivery to a 14.7 : 1 ratio. Maximum power in most 4 stroke engines
occurs when the air fuel ratio is about 12.5 : 1. This is why you tell
the DME the engine is cooler. This only happens at wide open throttle.

(4) Personally, I like the K&N air filter. If you have to replace a
dirty one, why not spend another $20. for this. Even if you don`t
believe it flows better (I do), it will last forever if you maintain it
properly.

(5) Get a razor knife and carefully cut around the rubber seal on top of
the air flow meter, pry the black cover off and spray lubricating
contact cleaner (available at any electronics hobby store) on the
resistive film. Replace the cover with silicone. This is just
maintenance, these things get dirty just like rotary volume controls on
old radios.

(6) Use synthetic gear oil in the transaxle. The transaxle stays cold
because its not mounted to the engine, conventional oil will thicken in
cold weather (where I live). Synthetic makes shifting a lot faster.

THINGS TO AVOID / MONEY TO SAVE

(1) Don`t install headers or free flowing exhaust, the horsepower claims
are always a lie (the 944 has a great exhaust manif. albeit weak) and
the losses in low end torque are more severe than the minor top end
gains.

(2) Don`t install bored out throttle bodies, again more lies. In fact I
know an engineer that designs venturies for natural gas products and he
says flow will be reduced if the taper through the throttle bore is
disrupted.

(3) Don`t go overboard on huge tires, they greatly increase rolling
resistance and will very noticeably slow down your car. The handleing
gains don`t increase proportionally with tire size, however they do look
good. I hate tradeoffs.

(4) If your autocrossing or going out to give the car a work out on a
nice road, don`t fill the gas tank. It`s HUGE ! and it holds 150 lbs of
fuel! Kenny Bernstien once remarked; It cost the R&D department $1000/lb
to trim wait off the race car. He dieted and lost 40lbs, I always
wondered if he wrote off  40 grand at tax time as research expenses.

Something I have not tried yet:  I have been told by reliable sources
that the balance shafts consume 5 horsepower at high revs. I cannot see
a reason why you could not just remove the balance shaft belt. The
vibration can`t be that bad, there is a ton of 2.5 L engines in cars
without them. This is obviously personal preference. Has anyone tried
it? How did it work out?

In regards to some of the postings on the list this week, these
modifications will not enable you to beat any Porsche on the road, you
will not do 0-60mph in 5.8sec. But my car can suck the headlights out of
one of those turbo Sprints. Also, I`m not backing the V8 conversion.
They`re just never done right.    So that`s it!  Constructive criticism
is always welcome. No flames please, It`s Christmas. Please have a good
safe one.     TTFN   Dave C.       SuperD@direct.ca

P.S. To Nick F., Sorry Nick, I`ve got nothing for your 944s. It has too
much compression to screw around with. Porsche stuck two knock sensors
into this motor just to save it from itself, let alone me.

P.S. To Jim Pasha if you happen to see this, I loved the story about the
speed record 356. But I was wondering why the dual plugs aren`t wired to
fire at the same time?(p.80 picture). There could be a little more speed
here. Could you shed any light on this?
