Well, it's one of those things, build the car for top-end power for track
events and hillclimbs, or build the car for low-end power for auto-x.
I really enjoy autocrossing, but I have to make a decision now for what
objective I am going to build the car and that is for top-end power.
And, anyhow, if I really wanted to hone the autocross skills, I'd get an
S2, back to my basic rules, you wanna be the fastest, go to the fastest,
and the fastest around here run S2's.

If I was to run a 944T seriously in auto-x, I'd need to run the smaller
K26-6 turbo rather than the S or K27 turbos, probably have to work on
a good compressor bypass valve setup to keep the turbo going as much
as possible with minimal lag and get Jason to setup a good suspension
for me.  

I will still run the racecar in an auto-x, but I don't expect it to
be super competitive, perhaps up there in the top-10, but I doubt it
could be FTD what with all the slick shod 914's and full race Mustangs
around here.
