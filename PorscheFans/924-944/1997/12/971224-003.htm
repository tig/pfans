Tell me about it! Leaving the 924 out one night I couldn't open the driver's
side door from the outside and had to get in through the passenger side door
and open it from the inside. Big mistake. I had to drive into town holding
the door shut with one hand and steering with the other (thank Vishnu the
car is an automatic). Driving round roundabouts was quite fun. "Hey, what's
that draft.. Damn, the door!"

Sounds like something I have to try as soon as possible.

The heat in mine is not pathetic, but the fan is. I'm wondering, as all 924
owners I have talked to seem to have the same problem, is the fan supposed
to be really lame or is it just a very common bug? The fan is practically
unusuable except for pumping some warm air into the cabin. Using it for
defrosting is out of the question, it's far too lame for that.

Try http://www.vcnet.com/worlduph/ .. Don't know about the quality, but I
think they have 944 kits.
