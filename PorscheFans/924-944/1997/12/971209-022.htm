None of these symptoms really track with anything I have ever seen caused
by an incorrect spark plug.    However, if you really do suspect the plugs,
why not just go back to the plug recommended for the car and see what 
happens.    We can speculate until our heads spin, when ten dollars worth
of plugs will either solve the problem or it won't.   If the correct plugs
do NOT
solve the problem, get back to us.

>Hi,
>
>I'm having weird problems with my new Bosch Super 4 spark plugs. I own a
>1981 European 2 liter Porsche 924. My spark plugs are W78.
>
>Below is what I noticed about my engine while under load (gear engaged):
>
>* Between idle and 2000rpm, the engine is smooth and power is good.
>* Between 2000rpm and 3000rpm, the engine jerks once every 3 seconds
>(during acceleration only). Power is still great.
>* After 3000rpm, the engine will suddenly stop jerking and the power is
>back to normal (like using my old W7DC). There's also a new noise like some
>soft throbbing vibration noise.
>
>There used to be a metalic burning smell from my exhaust. With my new
>plugs, the smell is gone.
>
>Can anybody explain the jerky movements and weird throbbing noise that I'm
>experiencing?
>
>A mechanic told me that the W78 is for carburetor engines. He said the W78
>SR models are for fuel injected engines. My engine is a fuel injected one.
>What do you think? There shouldn't be a difference whether your engine is
>caburetor or fuel injected, right?
>
>Thanks.
