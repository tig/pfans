Howdy,

Thought I'd chime in after that very intriguing post by Jim Pasha, hmmm...
V8 in two years, maybe the new 996 has more in common with the 928
that just its tailights and engine cooling method.

In Kelowna, B.C., every year we have a hillclimb called Knox Mountain
Hillclimb.
The last year, I was helping a fellow competitor by being his pit (s)crew
(Paul and I ended up sleeping in and left him to do most of the work on day
1!)
At the hillclimb was a cool 944/968/V8 hybrid.  It was a bit arrogant of a
car with a supercharger pulley sticking out of the hood (well, it was 
covered, but you could see it spinning in there).  I can't remember if it was
a Ford V8 or a Chevy, but it was pretty fast.  The guys ran a respectible
time up the hillclimb 2:16 or 2:18 on Dunlop SP8000 street tires.  The
fastest production style car up the hill was a 1:58 which was a turbo 510
with Goodyear slicks (about 250hp in 2200lbs).

While the car did not look to handle very well from watching it go around
the corners, it did have good grunt, it didn't sound as nice as a 951
with the boost up at WOT, but it did not sound out of place on a Porsche.

The reason the guy put the V-8 in there was because they blew the factory
944 motor and had the cylinder honed (those who are familiar know where 
this is going).  They did not know of the special coating Porsche puts on
the cylinders (I believe it's called Nikasil, correct me politely if I'm
wrong) and when the motor was fired up for the first time, the piston
siezed to the cylinder (sounds like they really messed up).  At that point,
he was ticked off and stuck the V-8 in there.

The biggest problem these guys had was transmission and transaxle problems.
The car had eaten a few transmissions, a ring&pinion, but worst of all,
they were not able to finish the event because they broke a driveshaft or
another transmission part when shifting into second after a hard launch.

Personally, I would not do a V-8 conversion.  This car had turned a 13.? @
114mph in the 1/4 which is fast.  A chipped 944T does 13.9 @ 104mph, but
a race prepped, low weight 944T should turn low 13's @ 108mph which is
getting closer, but still about 60hp shy of the V-8 conversion.

The guys were from Calgary, Alberta and had the license plate, "YFLY" which
was pretty cool.  Maybe they are on the list and can talk more about their
car.

Farzaan.
