Mark,

You do not want to have the hatch lift by itself, trust me.  Letting the
hatch open by itself puts stress on the hatch frame and eventually
separates the frame from the glass, not cool at all.  The stress is due to
the abrupt stop when the hatch opens all the way and reaches the end of
the travel of the hatch shocks.  Even if the hatch is opened by hand, it
needs to be assisted so it does not jerk to a stop when it opens all the
way. 

I am not coming up with this by myself.  I cannot trace it right now down
to the specific issue, but there was a technical article on this either on
Excellence or Panorama.  The Dec issue of Excellence has a nice article
index so one could easily check if one of that magazine's issues contained
the article.  There are no flames intended here, just trying to help you
and others avoid headaches down the road.
