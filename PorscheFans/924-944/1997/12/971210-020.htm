Dana,

First, as the original poster, I know and like the 951.  If I didn't like
them why would I own one and be looking for another?  Are you really that
sensitive to someone commenting that the 951 in stock form isn't perfect?
It isn't.  Ask anyone who races one. They do offer a great bang for the
buck ratio which is why I like them.

Well, I for one like to read the Pano, but I take what the write with a
serious "grain of salt".  I don't think that a puplication as biased as the
Pano can be fully trusted for an unbiased view point.  Plus, this is far
from good data to help me in my search for another 951.

This is relative.  What might seem like great brakes to one, seem poor to
another.  My girlfriend thought the brakes on the 951 were awesome, but he
daily driver is a Mercury Tracer.  I drive an E30 M3 daily, have a track
prepared 951, and get to play with an IMSA (what are they called now?!?)
GT-3 911, GTA Pontiac, 2 ITC 510s, my 951, and the ultimate Porsche a 962.
Coming from this backround, I found the stock 951 brakes to be VERY poor.
I have heard this from my fellow 951 racers as well.  So while they may be
great for you, I found them unsatisfactory to me.

Conservative in what way?  This isn't the '60 were GM was under rating some
of their muscle cars by over 100hp.

>but the car is good for the mid 150s at least.  

I don't doubt this in the least.  My 951 has completed the Pony Express
with an average speed up in the 160 range.

I don't think you really want to compare racing history of the 951 to the
M3.  The M3 is the winningest car in touring class racing EVER MADE.  No
car is close.  The E30 M3 was a racing phenomenon.  The 944 never had a
chance as a great race car since it lacked solid factory support (the 911
was still *the* car for Porsche.)

>Maybe the car just wants another mechanic,

Possibly.

>or maybe another driver.

Is this some sort of personal attack?!?  I can see why Faarzan thinks the
DSM group is a more friendly group.  Jeeze.  I ask a simple question, and I
get flamed.  Maybe some of you (just a few of you) need to grow up.  We are
supposed to be a free forum for help.  I was not attacking the 951, just
wanting to know if I was looking at a bad car.  This is what I get in
response.  THANKS.  You (not just Dana) have already pissed of Farzaan, now
you are starting to piss me off.  If you keep this up you'll end up just be
a bunch of un-informed folks discussing how your car kicks-ass.  Low
substance, high ego building (obviously Dana's area.)  If you want people
who actually have some good substance to write, you may want to avoid
personal attacks.  There is no reason for them here.

>     Enjoy your BMW sedan.  (Nice car!  It's one of those new Nissan
>Maximas isn't it!)

You obviously are VERY sensitive about your car, and have NO clue what an
E30 M3 is.  


>     When did BMW switch from recirculating-ball power steering?

The 540i still uses it.  So what?  It still offers world class steering
feel.  Haven't driven one of these either I guess...

>Flame Off!

Thanks for the flame. Now please re-read my post and offer a constructive
post.  If not, don't bother writing me (or the list.)  I have offered many
good things to the list in the past, and I deserve to get the same in
return.  I get 5 good responses, and then this...
