To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere…),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had tons
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too… after all, the way the police is checking now a days it's
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny –
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones either
(look mom, no hands… look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can get
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with our
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know…

Dear P-Fans,

Sorry about the re-post on this but it seems it didn't get out the first time
.. . . . . maybe it was blocked by too many "cheeseheads"!

1.  Awhile back I wrote that my passenger-side radiator fan wouldn't stop
running and the general consensus on the list was that the thermoswitch was
bad.  I've been getting ready to replace it but I had another thought.  If
there is only one thermoswitch for the fans, why does the driver-side fan
still cycle on and off normally?  Could it be a bad relay or something else?
Or, is it really the thermoswitch?

2.  All of a sudden my clutch doesn't seem to want to return as quickly as
normal when I lift my foot off.  It still comes up but it feels like it
hesitates slightly and the amount of effort it takes to press the pedal seems
"light".  The clutch doesn't slip or grab at all but it seems almost too easy
to depress the pedal and then it hesitates to return properly.  Is this master
cylinder, slave cylinder, or what?

TIA for the help,

Rich Freitas  (FreitasRJ@aol.com)
