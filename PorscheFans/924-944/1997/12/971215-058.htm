Well, these are the video's I have in chonological order, and my comments,
with emphasis on the video's instructive nature:

A Compilation of Japanese and local racing videos (1997 2hrs) This is the
famous Mr. WOT video, and isn't intended as an instructional video. If you
like turbo's, especially Japanese car turbo's, you'll *love* this video.
Dialogue is in Japanese but Farzaan's printed comments help a *lot*. The
"Supercar shootout" road-race bits are designed to pit various supercars
against each other, but watch the drivers. Some of them are a *lot*
smoother than others. The local footage is home video quality <cough>, with
the autocross footage the most instructive. Farzaan and Paul autox very
well, plus there's a run by Bill Beutow <sp?> that is very nice.

In the Driver's seat, a lap of Mid-Ohio (1997 30 mins.) This is an SCCA
track video, about a half-hour long. It doesn't (directly) teach driving.
It *does* teach the line at Mid-Ohio, what to avoid, common line mistakes,
etc. The car used is an NSX. Production value is very good. The kind of
video to watch over and over again before the Mid-Ohio PCA club race :-),
at least, that's the idea. I've never driven at Mid-Ohio, but after
attending the runoffs last year I *am* going to make it down, if not for
the club race (kinda early in the season for me) than for a driver's ed. As
I am a notoriously slow learner when it comes to tracks, I'm hoping it'll
improve that.

Autocrossing in the Fast Lane (1991). Much Porsche content. Good for
beginners. Shows a type of autox course that just doesn't exist here in
Canada (My Gawd! You Americans use so many cones!) Production values okay,
but better technology exists today.

Behind the wheel with Jackie Stewart (1987). I don't know if this video is
still available. In-car footage of Jackie wailing in a Trans-Am Mustang
(Capri?) the best part. Lots of fluff. Jackie's nuggett's of wisdom are
there, but there are some silly bits to wade through. A good video if you
want to have a better driving attitude, but not strong on technique. Good
production values makes it the most "watchable" of all the video's listed
here (produced for Ford by Lorimar).

Drive to win - the Russell school video with Mario Andretti and Gilbert
Pednault (1986). This is a classic, especially if you are a Mario fan. One
of the more boring videos ever made (I can't watch the whole thing in one
sitting), cheesy production values (1986 - pretty much the first time
in-car race footage was tried), but more meat than most *books* on driving.
I've watched this video more times than I've seen the Star Wars movies, and
with every watching I learn something new. Anyone who says they can't learn
from Mario Andretti's words in this video is deluding themselves or just
isn't at the level to be able to understand what is(n't) being said. No
relation to Carrol Smith's "Drive to Win" book, but the two do complement
each other well, in the sense that the beginner won't get that much out of
either right away, but with the passage of (track) time comes appreciation.
