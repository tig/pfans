Diagnosis is needed!!!  I replaced my power steering pump last weekend,
everything went well, and it was an easy installation.  However, the
instructions and my fellow mechanics told me in order to bleed the lines I
just have to turn the steering whell from lock to lock and I'm done.  Well,
its not that easy, I'm still having that large groaning sound when I turn,
and I'm wondering if I have some air trapped in there.  Any input would be
appreciated.

Joe:

Bad news!  It is quite likely that the steering gear assembly is shot.  Probably there 
were and probably still are bits of metallic debris in your fluid from the rack & pinion 
wiping out it's bushings.  The debris is likely what took out the pump.  Now that you 
have full pressure back again, it is making the steering gear sound off.  This is, of 
course, just a guess but things won't get any better if its true.  If you let it go long 
enough then the new pump will be lost too.  Check your fluid for metallic particles.  
Another check would be to raise the front wheels off the ground and then go lock to 
lock.  See if the groaning goes away when not under load.  If it does then you're not 
dealing with air bubbles.

Good luck,
