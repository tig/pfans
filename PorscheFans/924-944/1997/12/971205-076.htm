To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere…),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had tons
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too… after all, the way the police is checking now a days it's
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny –
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones either
(look mom, no hands… look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can get
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with our
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know…

<< Subject: 924S/944 : any deleterious effects of low mileage?
 
 Hi P-fans,
 
  An opportunity has come up for a VERY low mileage '88 924S; The sales man's
 report is that the car has  been stored in a dry garage and only run for
 500 miles a year for the past 8 years.
 
 My query: (and assuming the tacho isn't too stuck or rewound) is there
 anything I should be especially wary of in condidering a 924S with a
 driving history  of this nature?  (apart from the truth of this story of
 course) >>


Beware!

The speedo's on the three hole cars (early 944, and all 924) are prone to
odometer failures. I have seen more that a few of these cars where the
odometer has stopped working. The nylon drive gear for the number wheels
strips, or cracks, rendering the odometer inoperative.  The speedo still works
fine. 

I would not necessaryily skip this car, I would just be wary of the claimed
actual mileage. Maybe service records will prove/disprove the low mileage. 

As you should do before considering any Porsche purchase, have a
disinterested, qualified third party repair facility perform a pre-purchase
inspection. 

These cars (924S) are good values and get you a late 944 drivetrain at bargain
basement prices. . If you can verify the low mileage is correct, go for it!
Low mileage is good mileage.

Good luck!
