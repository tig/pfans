Steve,
      This could indicate that you have a leak in your exhaust system between 
your header and O2 sensor, possible suspect being that exhaust test port tube 
that runs up into the engine compartment at the rear of the manifold. If you 
do have such a leak, air is being sucked into your exhaust stream causing your 
O2 sensor to sense, you got it, more O2. The ECU would then increase injector 
pulse width to richen the mixture causing the rough idle. I would suspect that 
if you do have such a leak, it is small. Try tightening the connection where 
the test port tube meets the exhaust. The risks are fairly low to leaving your 
O2 sensor disconnected, but you could melt down your Catalytic converter, and 
you will use more fuel. Another possibility could be that your O2 sensor is 
failing.

Good Luck, let us know what you find!
Ezra
