This is an old thread but I wanted to ask this.  What if you have the white
smoke on startup (not everytime), are *not* losing coolant at a high rate
(if any at all), and the rough idle is only there sometimes on startup?
(usually no rough idle at all except for a few occasions, maybe once a
week)  I recently had the oil cooler/seals replaced to prevent any problems
there.  I've only noticed the white smoke since my car sat for a couple of
months (September and October) when the weather started started turning
cold.  It was at this time that the car sat while I got the money to
replace the DME unit.  I just started driving it again a couple of weeks
ago.  (daily driver)  Could this just be normal or does anybody think I may
have the start of a head gasket problem?

TIA,
