Somebody posted a question about Haynes being incorrect on the timing of
the 924 just after Christmas. This struck a chord with me but I cleaned
up my mail box before I could reply.
I posted some messages quite a while ago after my timing belt snapped,
mainly complaining about the trouble I had setting up, the problem was
not Haynes was wrong, it's that it didn't explain everything or missed
bits (without going back through the book I can't be sure which). 
Here's what I learnt
Use the TDC marker on the flywheel, not the little one on the pulley as
suggested by Haynes.
There are 2 dots on the top pulley one on the front and one on the back
these are not in line, the one on the back is the correct one to use.
I don't know if the later copies of Haynes are better, if they are maybe
I should get one.
Hope this helps and everybody on this wonderful list had a good
Christmas and has a happy new year.
