Hi,



1. Started to run rough. Would die out at lights, when slowing down etc. 
Do I need a tune-up.  Car has 150k.  Mechanic said this baby is good for
another 100k. Any thoughts?

The problem might be the voltage regulator in the alternator. this is a
$50 part that is easy to change - it screws into the back of the
alternator. You might check the battery voltage when the car is running.
If below 12V try a new regulator. And your mechanic is wrong - with
proper care your car should last another 200,000 miles.

2. When I have the heater on I hear what sounds like water sloshing
around coming from the vent. What to do?  What to do?

Water system is not bled. Instructions for bleeding are in the Haynes
manual (worth every penny). You don't get heat until you rtev the
engine, right?



3. Went to run it for awhile today (12-21-97) and there was gas leaking
around the hose connected to the fuel filter housing.  I shut it off
figuring once the engine got hot could ignite. Please advise. ASAP 

Probably just tighten the nuts. I think they are 17mm and 19mm.
