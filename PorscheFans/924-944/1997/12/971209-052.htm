Seems that nobody at PCNA can get this straight.  I called them today and
was told the recommended change interval for my 1990 S2 was still 45K.
The nice women who helped me could not find any service bulletin that
changed that, so I don't know where the person you talked to got their
information.  After belt replacement, the tension is to be checked at =
2000
miles according to the book.

Probably?  Boy, now that's a definitive answer isn't it!

Anyway, with all this talk of belt failures, I'm getting paranoid and =
plan
to get mine done pretty soon as my car now has a whopping 30,500 miles.

Sorry about the abbreviation.  Here is my assessment of the cost/value trade-
off involved when examining an increase in spring rate for a 951
street/AX/track car:

Anyway, as I was saying, I believe that Truechoice still has the 944, 944S2,
and 951 specs on file from a variety of past IMSA teams, and they have more
recently done some SCCA and Porsche Club racing units.  Anyway, the difference
between the Koni racing 3011 and the 3012 is that one is aluminum bodied,
while the other is steel (read weight difference).  Both allow for bump and
rebound adjustments, and are built to user specs.

The steel units are about $450 - $500 each.  The come with threaded bodies and
perches, so all you have to buy separately is the 2 1/4" diameter spring of
your choice.  Then you'll need some mounting hardware for the top and bottom
of the racing Konis, e.g., the stuff sold by Kelly-Moss, or fabricated by my
friend Mark's machine shop friend.  I have also heard that Truechoice can
build the shocks with mountings like the factory Koni units (i.e., with a
rubber bushings on both ends).

So, once you take out the torsion bars, you wind up with coilovers for about
$1,200.  To offset these costs, you can sell your torsion bars, and your
existing shocks, if they are any good.  You can then change rear ride height
and spring rates at will.

The 968 M030 set-up is cheaper, but not as "pure."  The shocks are about $125
- 150 each (from the dealer), and the upper perches are about $30-35 each.
Then you'll need a short helper spring like he ones I bought from Carrera for
$140/pair.  So add it up to a little over $500 bucks.  To change the ride
height, you're still stuck with the spring plates.  Unfortunately, I have not
been able to find these shocks in the aftermarket.  This means that when they
wear out, I can't get them replaced by Koni under their wearranty program
(although I think that they have the dealer's 24 month warranty).

Here in CA we pay $70/hour for labor at a majority of shops.  Torsion bar
replacements are 6 - 12 hours, plus you have to buy the bars, which
incidentally are on sale at OG Racing (I'd give Jason Burkett/Paragon a chance
to match the price).

I know a guy that paid full list for 30mm bars, and had 'em installed for 12
hours of labor! 

So pay your money and take your choice.  For me, it made the most sense to go
with the 968 set-up for a couple of years.  Maybe I'll buy the racing units
next year.

Of course, you can also buy the "Cup Car" Bilstein coilover set-up.  If you
get the shocks custom valved, they may be okay, but I am not sure where you
could get the valving specs, and how you could provide them to Bilstein, or
what the cost would be.  Maybe Kevin Buckler at Racer's Group knows how.

No one I know who has tried off-the-shelf Bilsteins in a coilover set-up has
liked them.  They all say that they are too stiff, and cause the rear of the
car to hop in corners.
