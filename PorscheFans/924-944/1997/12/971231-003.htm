<shrug> Put in a 968 transaxle... 6-spd, LSD, higher-ratio ring and
pinion... that would take care of *both* ends.

With the right gearing, many things are possible... :-) Even if you stay
with the turbo gearbox, consider the S2 ratio ring-and-pinion (3.875 vs
3.375) if your expected tracks will benefit from that gearing. (Supposedly
real S2 gears won't take the strain and a turbo-strong ring and pinion was
made available by the factory. I've never seen one.)

Don't forget you can autocross the kart! :-)

Fastest around here is an SP Talon AWD, in Montreal, a '73 911 3.2.
