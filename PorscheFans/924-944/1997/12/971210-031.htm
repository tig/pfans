Hi Gang

Now that I have a new ride, I would like some opinions on wheel & tire options.

Car:	'93  968  Coupe with standard suspension (no LSD/ no M030)
	Standard 7J x 16 (55mm offset) with 205/55  Fronts
	Standard 9J x 16 (52mm offset) with 225/50  Rears
	(5-spoke turbo design cast aluminum)

I still have from my '88 Turbo S a set of original forged 7-spoke alloys
	7J x 16 (65mm offset)  Fronts
	9J x 16 (60mm offset)  Rears
	(all currently with spent R1s in 225/50 and 245/45 sizes)

What I would like to do is use the forged alloys for local autocrosses and
drivers ed events.  Does anyone forsee any problems regarding fitment or
clearance?  Would I have to change the stud lengths?  I already have a set
of steel "open" type wheel nuts.  I'm not too worried about speedo errors,
and I probably won't get protested in my local region events.  If I can use
the Turbo rims, should I stay with the 225/50 & 245/45 tire sizes or is
there some other more suitable arrangement?  I don't currently plan on
upgrading any of the suspension or brake components, unless it would be to
change to slotted rotors.
Hopefully, the harness bar I removed from the Turbo will bolt right into
the 968.  I already have 2 sets of 5-point harnesses from the Turbo - I
know they will fit.
All comments/suggestions welcome.
