One will also find some plywood in the passenger side footwell, where your
feet usually park.  It covers the DME control unit, and the carpet and its
pad rests on top.  It appears to be strong for its weight - apparently
chosen by the factory for that quality and is not necessarily an
indication of 'cheapness' or whatever.  I have to agree I was somewhat
suprised to discover it when I removed the carpet to wire the Hi-Fi some 
time back.
