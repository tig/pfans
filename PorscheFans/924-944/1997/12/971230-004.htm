Thanks for the input, Ken. I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I'm
going to have to do the head gasket, after driving around a bit more and
observing. The usual smoke on startup from my leaking valve seals
seems to have been joined by white smoke from all the coolant... guess I
get to kill two birds on this one! (the valve seals are part of the head
gasket kit) So, the kit's on order, hope to do it over New Year's... should
provide some entertainment for the visiting out-laws!

Any things particular to this engine I should be aware of when doing this
head gasket?

As a result of this, in addition to some last minute additions, I'll be
resending the digest/completing the run after New Year's. I'll also be
adding a great list of 924 articles from Excellence & some other mags
that John Brown thoughtfully compiled.

Stay Tuned...
