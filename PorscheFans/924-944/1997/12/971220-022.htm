Scott,

Congratulations on the new (to you) 944! I own one of the same vintage,
and, while it is an expensive hobby, I wouldn't trade it for anything
but an '88 Turbo S. <g> 

Your problems seem to match up with what I've been dealing with lately.
My odo is dead too. I pulled it apart, and found that the plastic gear
on the shaft was not broken, as many have found, but that some parts
were simply worn down beyond the point which they would mesh. I just
ended up putting it back together and dealing with it for now.

Are you sure the tach itself is dead? You might try reseating/cleaning
up the connector behind it. As for the whine in the transmission, same
here - specifically in fifth gear, for me. Drive it till it breaks.
Swepco transmission lubricant will quiet it down some. I've heard horror
stories about shops butchering 944 transmissions, so I'm worried that
having it worked on may cause more problems than it may fix.

As for the stumble, I found out that my O2 sensor was kaput. If I took
my foot off the gas and let the car return to idle, it would "bounce",
that is, drop 200 revs below normal idle, then come back up. On the '44
this is normally the idle air stabilizer valve, but I unplugged my O2
sensor and it fixed it. It's going to stay unplugged for now. Those
things cost too darned much. I also found lots of "crud" (corrosion,
etc) in my coil connector. Check out your spark plug wires while you're
at it. Replacing mine gave me a ton of throttle response that I never
knew I had.

If your water pump is leaking antifreeze, fix it before it really leaks,
or worse, seizes.

In the last three years or so, I've put on a clutch, water pump
(+belts/rollers/seals), radiator, brakes, tires, battery, and a lot of
fussing with it on the weekends. Mine's due for some new injectors and
some ignition parts now. Yes, owning one of these things is a lot of
work. But it's all worth it when you can out-handle the little lowered
Honda Civics with wheels that stick out into the next lane and loud
exhausts. <g>

Alex.

Dennis and P-fans:

I am planning to attend the Pebble Beach concours (8/16) and the Monterey
Historics at Laguna Seca (8/14-16).  Be aware, though, that the featured
marque at Pebble Beach is NOT Porsche.  In fact, it is Minerva, a Belgian
luxury car manufacturer which produced very large autos from 1904-1939.  I
spoke with the office which organizes the concours and the woman there said
that many people were confusing the fact that Porsche is the featured marque
at the Historics with the concours.  She also expressed chagrin that few had
even heard of Minerva.

The telephone number for the ticket coordinator at Laguna Seca is
800-327-7322.  The number for tickets for the Pebble Beach concours is
408-372-8026.

I would love to see other P-fans at either event, especially at Laguna Seca!
I'm afraid, however, that driving either of my 968s 2500 miles each way is not
too appealing, but I would love to admire yours.
