Hi, folks

I'm about at the end of my string.  I've got an 82 924 that seen the inside of
a repair shop more than I've been able to drive it.  Here's my litany of
problems; maybe someone can help.  Problem(s) first started when the car simply
wouldn't start. I had found frayed wires going to the aux air valve and thrmal
time switch; fabricated a new harness and the problem seemed to disappear for a
while.  The mechanic found the boot going to the auxillary air valve was held
together with electrical tape and the other boot going to the air filter was
half off.  The sensor plate height was adjusted and when car started blew a ton
of black smoke.  Seems the PO relied heavily on Pep Boys parts and two spark
plug wires (just a year old) were bad. Replaced those and the car actually ran
better than it had since I acquired it.  One morning I go to fire it up and it
won't start again! By this time the towing company brings me coffee and
doughnuts when they come to pick up the car.  This time the problem is fairly
apparent (even to me).  The line from the gas tank to the fuel pump has worn
through.  Also, it seems this model has a fuel pump in the tank (Haynes manual
doesn't show this)that was leaking right around where the ground lug attaches.
These get replaced; the car starts right up and feels pretty good.  Drive back
to work BUT when I'm getting ready to leave I can't start the car.  Wait a
couple of minutes and with considerable tromping on the gas manage to get it
started but it stumbles and takes a little bit for the idle to smooth out.  Get
up this morning( about 40 degrees), crank it up and it starts right up with the
idle at a rock solid 900rpm. Get to work, let the car sit for about an hour and
now I can't start it. What is going on?  One thing to note is once the car
starts up there has never been a problem with stalling or crummy idle even when
the car had all those air leaks and it pulls well all the way to 6,000rpm. This
car also has a new head gasket and head rework.  I'm running out of my car
allowance money so any help you guys can provide will be great.

Thanks in advance

Ron
