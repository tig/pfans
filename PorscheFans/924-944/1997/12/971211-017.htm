Rudy --

Thanks. I just replaced sensor and it solved the problem. Pressure now maxs
out at just below 5 bar.  At start up idle, w/15-50 wt oil, it reads about
the same, and drops to around 3 bar at idle when the engine warms up.  Kind
of a pain to replace on the S2. Had to drop the power steering pump.
