You don't really need the "expensive tools" to replace the differential 
in a 944 transmission.  You do need a gauge to measure ring gear 
backlash, ideally, but one can be made up with a piece of angle-stock, 
a piece of flat stock, and three fasteners which is just as effective 
as the obscenely priced VW toolset.  The "expensive tools" come into 
use when installing a new pinion, or using another case, or anything 
else which requires establishing pinion depth.

And in fact you needn't really measure ring gear backlash that 
accurately.  Most mechanics I know do it by feel and are successful.  I 
measure it, but I'm weird that way.

Eight to ten hours is way high for replacing a differential once the 
transmission is out of the car.  I generally book two to three hours 
for the job, and that includes replacing the two differential carrier 
bearings, since they are inexpensive and have to be removed during the 
job anyway.  If you are going to rebuild the transmission at the same 
time, new synchros, seals, and bearings, then the eight to ten hours is 
in the ballpark.

(BTW, the people who sell the expensive tools, Zelenda, are very nice 
folks indeed, and I enjoy doing business with Ivana there.  No 
disrespect to them intended!)
