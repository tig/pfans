The best "aftermarket" wheels are sold by Porsche :-)  Unless you wish to
go to a 3-piece wheels such as the HRE, Fikse, etc., genuine Porsche
wheels from say, a 993, would be your best bet for a 17" upgrade.
Anything less would be worse than your forged S wheels.  If I had the
money I'd get Fikse wheels and I think they'd look awesome on a 944 Turbo
(I'm trying to convince my son to get some... then I can use his S rims =
on
my S2, hah, hah).

Robert Wood at Wheel Enhancement can put together a very attractive
package of 993 "Cup" wheel takeoffs (essentially zero miles) with any
tires you desire.  Expect to pay about $2300, depending on tires.  Robert
likes the Michelin Pilot MMX.
