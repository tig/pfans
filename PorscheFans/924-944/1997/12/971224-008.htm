I have seen them set to any value from below 2 to above 4.  That is why 
you need "the" Tool (P9201 and its accessories).

The tensioner is adjustable, so you could set it where you want.  I do 
not know if it is dependable.

>As part of my effort to learn as much as I can about 944s, I keep a lot of

>the earlier cars, you set the initial tension using the tool to 4.0 and
>then reset it to its normal running tension of 2.7 after the initial run in

>tensioner, it is locked in place and becomes a fixed device. After that, it
>must be loosened to retension the belt.  So, the question is, what tension
>does the spring tensioner set the belt to? Does it set the belt to 4.0 to
>allow for belt stretch, to 2.7 which is the normal running tension, or to
>some intermediate value? If anyone happens to know the answer these
