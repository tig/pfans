Farzaan Kassam <fkassam@direct.ca> asks:
> 3. What is a realistic weight that the 944T can be brought down to?

Last weekend I happened to find a couple of brochures that the
Porsche dealer gave me when I bought my 944.  (Circa 1987.)
One is a series of photos showing 'race car' vs 'production car'
of 911, 928, and 944, concluding with a poster of the Porsche Indy
car.

As I recall, the 944 pages show a 944 GTS racing car which was
raced prior to the introduction of the 944 in the early '80s.
The specs on it were about 1000 lbs lighter than the production
car.  (2900 vs. 3900 lbs?  I'll have to go back and look again.)
No mention if these weights were wet or dry.  The GTS was also
claimed to have 400+ hp.
