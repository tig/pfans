I have just purchased a 1991 944S2 coupe. The car is exactly what I was =
looking for for a long time. Anyway, I put the car up on blocks and did =
a though inspection of the undercarriage and drive line. The car has =
111,400 miles on it and is very clean. No oil leaks on any of the engine =
components. The only thing I found that I have a question is on the rear =
axle shafts.=20

The inner CV joints are some what greasy and the area around the =
transaxle case where the axle shaft is, is also greasy. There is no oil =
dripping from anywhere. When I grab a hold of the inner CV joint to test =
the bearing freeplay, I can wiggle the CV joint up and down slightly. =
The drivers side CV is pretty tight but the passenger side is looser =
then I would expect.  My question is how much radial free play should =
there be?=20

I also tested that the axle half shafts can slide in and out on the =
splines. I expected this movement. As a note, I will be getting the full =
manual set soon but I wanted to find out from other owners.

Thanks
