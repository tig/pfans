Thanks for the advice w/ respect to the stalling I experienced with my
951.  I still am unsure "exactly" what the problem was, as it has never
happened again  since I have tried to "fix" the problem.  Anyway, I
ended up disconnecting the leads to the air meter, TPS, etc and cleaning
/ reconnecting them.  I also checked for water leaks under the battery
tray possibly shorting the boxes under the dash - but found nothing.  I
checked the leads to the computers and found them secure.  My best guess
is that the Michigan roads jolted the contacts a little loose to the air
meter (the metal retaining band on the connector is missing).  Thanks
for all the advice - the problem seems to be gone (for now!).  
Incidentally, when inspecting the computer boxes under the passenger
side floor board I found a large (2 inch x 1 inch) female 12 pin
connector with large round contacts that was not connected to anything -
and apparently had not been for some time judging by the spider eggs in
some of the holes!  I put chips in the car over a year ago, but I cannot
recall whether this connector was free or not.  Any Ideas?  Thanks!
