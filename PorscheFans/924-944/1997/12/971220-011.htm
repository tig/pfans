In my experience with clutches, the rubber-centerd Sachs replacement feels soft
 and smooth during the first few months after installation. It then hardens
over time as the rubber loses moisture.

In replacing the clutch on my car, after "only" 45K in 3 years, I was deter-
mined to put in something that would last longer. As you know, if done properly
this is a pretty expensive job on a 944.

I made A LOT of calls, asked around and got mixed advice. In the end, what I
resolved was this:

1. To go with a spring-centered disk
2. To stay as OEM as possible on the plate and T/O bearing

With this in mind, I spotted the Centerforce ad on the back of the summer
TWEEKS catalog. Called, and it was outrageously expensive--like 1 grand.
Reading the ad more closely, I saw that Centerforce uses Sachs parts and
improves them. So, I set out to get just the spring-centered disk from them and
the rest from Sachs.

Well, TWEEKS wouldn't do this, but VERTEX in Miami has Centerforce disks that
it sells separately. They don't carry the plate even if you want it. So, I got
the "hybrid" kit and braced myself for the results, since EVERYONE was warning
me about the added vibration, noise, etc.

The truth is, the Centerforce disk is made to reduce these effects, as I soon
found out. It actually feels great. By "racy" I meant that you can FEEL that
it's metal. Kind of hard and springy when the car is cold, but pleasingly
giving as the metal springs warm. Another thing is performance.
My little 83 NA can really shoot out at a light. I've found that holding the
clutch in and reving up to 2K, the car "hums" slightly, but LESS than it used
to with the rubber centered. That was more of a roar.

In all, I would recommend the hybrid kit. Thus far, it's made my car more fun
to drive and hopefully (knock, Knock) will last longer than the other one did.

Dave:  Great post!  You mentioned:
<<(5) Get a razor knife and carefully cut around the rubber seal on top of
the air flow meter, pry the black cover off and spray lubricating
contact cleaner (available at any electronics hobby store) on the
resistive film. Replace the cover with silicone. This is just
maintenance, these things get dirty just like rotary volume controls on
old radios.>>

On my 1985.5 car, I actually loosened up the spring tension in the airflow
meter to allow the flapper door to open faster.  As I recall, there is a
serrated wheel in there, and I loosened the spring tension up about three
notches.  If you go too far, the flapper door flaps around in the intake
breeze, confusing the computer and causing a wandering idle.  However, if you
go one notch tighter than this (on my car, this was three notches looser than
stock), it allows the flapper to open faster.  I felt a noticeable improvement
in throttle response.  Anyone else tried this?

I have a broken drive shaft on a ''79' 924 I wanted to know if I can take the
shaft out of the tube and insert a shaft from another year as ' 79 is a hard
year to find.
