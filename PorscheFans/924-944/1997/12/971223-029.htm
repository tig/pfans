How can bad valve seals adversely affect compression? They're off in
the intake and exhaust portions of the head, not in the compression
chamber. I think what everybody means here is the valve seats, correct?

Namely, if you pressurize the cylinder at TDC, if you hear air hissing in
the air filter box, your intake valve is not seating properly, and if you hear
air hissing in the tailpipe your exhaust valve is not seating properly.

My understanding is that the valve seals only keep excess oil from
seeping from the camshaft area, past the valve stems, and into the
cylinder. Also, my understanding is that a sign of these being worn
(which I have) is that the engine will smoke on startup when recently run
(oil's seeped into the cylinders, gets burned off), but not if left overnight
(seeps past the rings and back into the sump). I though that oil smoke on
accelleration was only a sign of ring wear...

Any clarification?
