Joe,
    Sounds like your shift lever is worn, and you must have a lot of shifter 
slop! To check if that is the problem, remove the outer and inner boot so you 
can see and touch the shifter linkage. Observe or hold one hand on the linkage 
between the shift lever and the rod leading to the tranny. While moving the 
shift lever to the right and left, there should be little to no rotational 
play between the shift lever and rod leading to the tranny. If you do feel 
rotational play, carefully remove the C clip so as not to lose it, and slide 
the shift lever assembly away from the rod leading to the tranny. Look 
carefully at the rod welded to the shift lever, if the above is your problem, 
it will have observe severe wear. You can implement a temporary fix until your 
new shift lever arrives by cleaning all signs of grease from the worn rod, and 
applying appropriately shaped pieces of metal tape to the worn rod to return 
it to a more cylindrical shape. This worked for a couple of weeks for me, I 
used stainless tape.

Good Luck!
  Ezra
