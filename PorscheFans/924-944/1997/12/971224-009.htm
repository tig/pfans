Merry Christmas to all!
While doing last minute shopping yesterday, I encountered a problem with
my '86 951.  I started the car in the parking lot, noticing the idle was
rough (car was still warm though).  I attempted to back out and found
that if I pushed the gas pedal more than 1/8 inch, the car would
stumpble and stall.  I rolled back, and put the car in first only to
find the same thing.  I was able to get the car driving by teasing the
gas pedal - but the car had the acceleration of a school bus.  I shut
down the engine, and checked all the basic connections under hood etc
(yes, there was plenty of fuel:-))  When I started the car up again, the
problem was gone.  On the short trip home, the problem started again. 
Driving at 40 mph, suddenly I had to take my foot off the gas in order
to keep from stalling - I could only put the pedal in a tiny bit to keep
the car moving.  I've started and driven the car around home several
times, and the problem hasn't shown up again.  The car has been rock
solid for the past year, and this is rather frustrating b/c I cannot get
the problem to repeat consistantly enough to diagnose it.  The fuel pump
connections in the rear are good, and my best guess is some electrical
short in the fuel/ignition sensors - perhaps the throttle position
sensor.  Does anyone have ideas?  Thank You!
