Tom,
      Don't rush out and replace those timing belts just yet. Since our
discussions about the replacement intervals, I've done a lot of digging to
see if there was any light to be shed on this subject. I went browsing
through my old issues of Excellence to see what I could find. I located an
article in the August 1994 issue on 924/944/968 timing belts and water
pumps. It was written by Jim Pasha (a member of this list). For anyone who
hasn't read this article - you need to. After reading Jim's article, I
decided to give PCNA another call.  This time I spoke to a different
representative but, he told me the same thing (replace at 30000 miles). He
also told me that different year models had different replacement
intervals.  According to Jim's article the interval was changed several
times and, in a 1989 service bulletin, was finally set at 45,000 miles.
This included being checked and readjusted at 2000 miles and checked at
15,000 and 30,000 miles. A service bulletin which came out with the 968 had
the interval at 60,000 miles. Totally confused, I decided to e-mail Jim to
see if I could get some more background. Jim was more than helpful.
According to Jim, the replacement interval 10 years ago was 30,000 miles
(Check and reset at 1800 miles, inspect and reset at 15,000 miles).  When
the Pirelli belts came out, the life was extended to 45,000 miles at the
discretion of the mechanic (still included an initial check at 1800 miles
with inspections every 15,000 miles).  This is the recommendation for all
cars with the spring loaded tensioners. I don't know yet if this includes
the 924s and 944s made before 1987 (like mine) without the spring
tensionsers (I'm waiting to hear back from Jim). I would have to believe it
does since there is no difference between the earlier and later models once
the initial tension is set (i.e. after the initial tension is set by the
spring tensioner, it is locked in place). The initial check at 1800 miles
is still required since the spring tensioner must be loosed to allow it to
tighten the belt. For the 968s (with the hydraulic tensioners) the interval
is 60,000 miles provided they are checked at the usual 15,000 mile
intervals. The cars with hydraulic tensioners do not require the initial
check at 1800 miles since they are maintained at the correct tension by the
hydraulic tensioner. When checking the condition of the belts at the normal
service intervals they must have no cracks, gouges, oil, fuel or coolant
damage or contamination  and the roller and gears are not pitted or gouged.
Jim still recommends checking the tension using the tool (P9201) even on
cars that have the spring tensioner. Most of this information is quoted
directly from Jim Pasha's  article or his e-mail to me so, if you find this
information useful send your thanks to him. Sorry if any e-mails prior to
this created any confusion. I hope this clears things up.

Thanks for the information Jim (You 'da man!) and please flame me if
anything here is inaccurate or I've left anything out.

<< but a porsche is a porsche...IS A PORSCHE!!!!  if you want a
 350...buy a vette. >>

MM,
Don't get me wrong here, family history and loyalty are all fine and dandy,
but I bought my 951 for one reason:  It's the fastest think I could afford.

I've owned my 951 for 2-1/2 years, and one thing I realize is that if I had
spent the $17k on the VR4 I almost bought, I'ld never have the track
experience  (although it's not really much) I have, I wouldn't be able to work
on it as much myself, and I'ld have a fast ugly teel green car.  I love my
951, and if it gets run over by a caddy tomorrow, I'll start looking for
another.  

I'm at work so i can't rant forever (seems like a constant theme, huh?), but
the quest is performance that I can afford.  When and if this engine
rebuild/swap arrives, I'll go w/ the best cost/performance ratio I can get.  I
include the weight differences with this as well.
