     Hi guys well I said I'd keep you up to date on the reply from Porsche 
     Club Great Britain regarding the lack of Water cooled cars on their 
     50th Aniversary print. 
     
     The reply from the Chairman of PCGB regarding the print goes as 
     follows, I've paraphrased some of it I'm sure he won't mind.
     
     He makes the point that featuring every quote 'milestone of Porsche 
     production' would require a larger poster and that the brief to the 
     artist was to reflect Porsche's racing history. It was up to the 
     artist how he did this. I think you'll agree that there are mostly 
     race cars in the print. Although not water cooled race cars.
     
     He also said quote 'Let me assure you that there is absolutely no hint 
     in this office or the directors of the ridiculous air cooled v. water 
     cooled nonsense. This club is for all Porsche owners and will remain 
     so'.
     
     At least I got a reply.
     
     Regards,
     
     Steve Cox.
