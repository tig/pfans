Bill,

I hate to rain on people's parades (well, actually I am a bit of a 
sadist), however, I have had one window replaced by Safelite, much to my 
dissatisfaction.

The workmanship, which I should point out could be simply due to the 
particular shop or individual and not an organizational problem, was 
outrageous.  I had more problems, including stress cracks in the glass, 
than was worth the effort.

I do not know why you had to have this job done three times, however, you 
are probably due a refund if the car is not bent.  What I mean is if your 
car is not the problem, then the shop is not qualified for this repair.

Choosing another shop should be done by investigation of what cars they 
have done before and if they have had specific experience with the 944.  
The 944 is not an easy installation and requires more expertise than many 
other cars.

the Better Business Bureau will be able to provide you a list of any 
previously filed complaints if they are a member, but this will not 
answer all of your questions that pertain to your quest.  You need to 
talk to dealers that handle high end cars and get their recommendations.

Some insurance companies can limit your choices, such as State Farm, with 
which shops can replace glass in your car.  If you want full payment, you 
must play by their rules.  If this is the case I would call your agent 
and bring them up to date with your experiences that one of their 
entrusted subcontractors is not up to the job.  They need that feedback 
to keep quality up and they may have a better glass shop to recommend, 
but check them out first.

Good luck
