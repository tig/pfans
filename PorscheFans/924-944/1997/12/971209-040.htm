I just did that job myself last month on my 85.5 944.  Perhaps the first
generation are the same in this respect.  The lower timing mark is
actually a ridge of plastic coming off the bottom of the rear cover and
sits at about 7 oclock.  Once you know where to look, it's easy to see. 
Also my porsche certified mechanic/service manager friend told me to set
the balance shaft belts so that 90 degrees of deflection is possible by
hand.  180 degrees is too much, maybe you skipped a tooth on the bottom
one.
