Hi P-fans,

I'm seriously considering the sale/trade of the 924 that was the subject of
so many hassles with my local dealer.

An opportunity has come up for a VERY low mileage '88 924S; The sales man's
report is that the car has  been stored in a dry garage and only run for
500 miles a year for the past 8 years.

My query: (and assuming the tacho isn't too stuck or rewound) is there
anything I should be especially wary of in condidering a 924S with a
driving history  of this nature?  (apart from the truth of this story of
course)

In particular, I wondered whether belts etc. would be prone to
loosening/deterioration under these low-use (verging on abuse) conditions.
I know that the 924S/944 2.3 engine has some rather critical belt tensions
etc - and I'd not love one to go "pop" taking the valves with it even
before the car reached its 10k mile service!

I'll be glad of any advice on this point

thanks ia

Roz McCarthy
