Too late.  They are being done tomorrow, and it's not the mileage that
bothers me but the age.  I also wrote Jim Pasha about this and as usual,
he responded quite fast (kudos to Jim!).  He recommended that I get the
belts done because of the age.  Once they are changed he said they should
be good for 45K if the tension is adjusted at the 15 and 30K intervals.
By then I'll have my own tension gauge from my Dad (he'll be done with =
his
"last and final 928 belt change") so I can do this myself.  First I'll
practice on my son's car, hey, hey :-)

I'm probably also going to replace all the rollers and tensioners, or at
least any that are suspect.  I know at least one of them is bad because =
it
makes a noise when you start the car when cold.  It goes away as you rev
the motor.  I may also replace the balance shaft oil seals, and any =
others
that look suspect.  You know the routine... while we're in here...

>Jim still recommends checking the tension using the tool (P9201) even on

That's because these don't actually set the tension, they only set it to
the approximate value.  You still need to check it with the gauge.

=46WIW, the latest issue of 911 & Porsche World had a tech question from
someone who replaced their timing belt only at 48K miles (the recommended
interval in Europe) and he did not replace the balance shaft belt because
it looked good.  It broke at 80K and took the timing belt with it.  The
response from the magazine was they felt both belts should be replaced
every 3 years or 36,000 miles.  So, pick your interval: 45K, 36K, or 30K.

It appears from the history on my car that it has only been drive about
6,000 miles in the last 3 years.  All I can say is "she" is MUCH happier
to be in MY garage than the previous (lame) owner's, because she now =
knows
that she will get driven and exercised regularly.  I think I'll go out =
and
caress her fenders right now...
