Bill,

As a long term 944 autocrosser(and driving instructor), the 225/50 tires will
work fine and are not the cause of any problem. I have been using this size
for years, generally with RE-71s for the street (yoko avs intermediate lately)
and R-1s for the track. Your problem was that you lost traction on the rear
and were barely able to catch it. The reason for the loss might have been a
been a road surface irregularly but more likely was that you "lifted" perhaps
without realizing it. My experience as a driving instructor is that almost all
spins are from lifting when you are near the limit. A partial lift will result
in throttle steer (controlled oversteer). a more pronounced lift will cause a
spin. To correct the oversteer caused by a lift GET BACK ON THE GAS. This is
counter intuitive UNTIL YOU ATTEND A DRIVING SCHOOL. There are many driving
schools out there. PCA sponsors many including the one in SanDiego that I put
on. It is the best spent weekend of your life. 

Clutch comments: the rubber center dies from heat. it is not adequately cooled
for agressive use. The 993 has a cooling hose from the bell housing to the air
box to suck air from the clutch for cooling the "dual mass" clutch that is
similar to the 944 clutch. I have rigged a  2 inch cooling duct from the front
spoiler on the left side, past the left front suspension to the inspection
hole on the bell housing. Before this, I bought 3 clutches for our 83 all with
dead rubber centers and little wear on the clutch parts. I am about to replace
my clutch soon for WEAR after about 40,000 miles (15-20K  on prior clutches).
The rubber center does significat drive line shock absorbing preventing other
damage. This is why I haven't been tempted by the spring clutches. Also, I
don't know that they are available for my early car.
