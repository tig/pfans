HI,

Regarding problem:
Last night I went to open my drivers door (RHD 89.1 S2), and something
broke - it now locks, unlocks and opens from the inside, but the lever on
the outside doesn't do anything.
1.  How hard to strip down inside of door (can a novice like I do it) -
are there any step by step instructions (I have the two speakers under
elbow rest and one speaker up near door mirror)
2.  It sounds like the metal piece broke that was being discussed on the
list recently - does anyone have a Porsche/Audi/VW part number for this
(I'm almost certain these are Audi door handles, and with the price of
parts here in Australia, any cheaper option is welcome).
Thanks in anticipation........

IanS, Don't bother striping the inside of the door just yet, you won't see
the problem.  I have the same problem w/my door.  Loosen one single screw
on the side of the door, above the latch-machanisms.  From the outside,
slide(jerk) the door handle foward, and pull the unit out for inspection.
Mine is still broke, will try to fix after finals week.  

Therefore, anymore advice on getting parts for the door thingy will be
greatly appreciated.  (sorry if this request seems vague, it's related to
another message about my door posted a while ago.)
