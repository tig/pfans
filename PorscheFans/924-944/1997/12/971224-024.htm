I would expect that there would some oiling problems with this.  (I could be
wrong)   My biggest worry would be the turbo oil feed that is fed from the
upper balance shaft.

Actually, could someone explain this to me?  Why does the engine have to be
re-balanced if you take the balance shafts out of the loop?

I'm rather anxious about this because my crankshaft/pistons/rods are about to
be "balanced."  Do I have to tell the machine shop guy something is different
about my parts versus a V8's?

I thought the balance shafts were there to compensate for the no overlap engine
design of our 4 pots.
