I need some help diagnosing a problem with an 86 944 Turbo.  While at 
Roebling Road this past weekend the car would drop power whenever it 
was driven at full boost for an extended period of time.  The car 
seemed to be able to handle full boost of 1.6-1.7 Bar for about 5-6 
seconds.  After that it would lose boost and I am not sure whether 
the boost was being dumped out the wastegate, or fuel was being 
restricted.

Never saw the problem in first or second gear and assume it was 
because at full boost you don't stay in the gear very long.  The 
problem was always seen in third and fourth gear.  Where it takes 
more than 5-6 seconds to go to 6500 RPM.  I was able to race the car 
by shift to third, count to 5, shift to fourth, count to five, shift 
to fifth, count to five, then back off throttle to 1.4 Bar.  The car 
would hold 1.4 Bar in fifth gear the remainder of the straight.  If I 
tried to go back to full boost, it would cut out.  It seems that any 
significant back off from full power (like a shift) would restart the 
timer.  When boost was lost, it would not come back without lifting 
the throttle and reapplying at a lower power level.  The gauge never 
indicated an overboost condition existed.

The car had been to the track two weeks earlier without incident, but 
it exhibited this problem when it came off the trailer at Roebling.  
It has stock engine and chips.  During the weekend we examined every 
vacuum connection multiple times, all intercooler connections, and 
tried restricting the wastegate, but neither made any change in the 
performance.  Also, we replaced the fuel filter in the event some 
blockage was taking place at high demand.  The car runs and idles 
normal until spending more than 5 seconds on full boost.

Has anyone experienced this problem before or any suggestions on 
where to start for problem diagnosis?

Thanks

Rick
