My boyfriend's 83 944 did the same thing.  A couple of bad injectors was
the culprit.

Good Luck,

Walt Spector's comment about weights, specifically 3900 lbs vs 2900lbs for a
lightened race car seemed a wee bit heavy, laddie. My 84 944's manual shows
2778 lbs curb weight and a 3417 lb gross weight. Any 944 that weighed 3900 lbs
would undoubtedly be equipped with the very rare factory option, forged lead
wheels. That would explain it. Talk about unsprung weight.

All this blather about Chev Caprices, black or otherwise, leads me to comment
that with a cage installed, it's quite hard to load a handcuffed prisoner
through the rear door. That is what those whales were made for, right?
