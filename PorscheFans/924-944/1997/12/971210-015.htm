You can open the DME and click the rotary switch there to get, I think, 3%
advance (or retard, lean, rich, etc.).

Lee,
Thanks for the response, but the spring in question is about the size of a
valve spring. It tensions the mirror enough so that the wind won't collapse it
against the car at high speeds, but also allows it to fold against the car
body if it is hit. I think I've figured out a way to do it. All I can do is
try it.
By the way, how is your flooded car doing?
Thanks again, Colin F. 86'951 KC Region
