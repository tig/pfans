Repositing since my message was surrounded by dozen of cheeseheads!!!

Anyone ever tried to polish the foglight lens (depolished by years of
road debris).
I'm wondering if t could be polish with combound and cloth wheel on a
grinder!!!

Anyone had success or it is just a crazy canadian idea???


TIA

All,

I previously posted a question regarding a url link
(http://alabanza.com/tsnet/ledmod/) which I forgot to include in the post.

Anyway, the mod I had in question probably wouldn't do any good on a 951
except to let you know when the DME is limiting boost.  Which actually might
not be bad.

It's got some good stuff on the phenomenon of knock for those interested.

Sorry, I just sent all outgoing mail, and there was this post which I meant to
send in October!!  Anyway, it's regarding a little gizmo that the Diamond Star
guys (that's eclipses and talons) rigged up to flash a diode when the knock
sensor was picking something up.  I would love something like this, but I
don't think it's aplicable to the 951 (or is it???)
