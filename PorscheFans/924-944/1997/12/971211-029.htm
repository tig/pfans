Hi,

I contacted Windward Performance today regarding chips for the 944 S2.
They told me the ONLY brand to consider was Autothority.  They said
Weltmeister (Dinan) was more of a WOT chip, whereas the Autothority also
addresses part throttle maps and drivability.  List price on this chip is
$495, but Windward sells them for $369.  They come with a 30 day return
privilege and Windward claims they sell a lot of chips and their =
customers
are satisfied.  I think I'll try one.

I also asked about exhaust systems and they have the B&B cat back full
stainless system for $849, list $1050.  It is made in the good ol' US of
A, as opposed to the Borla stuff, which Windward claims is now made in
mainland China.  Anyone have one of these?  If so, how does it sound?  I
don't want something super loud, I want something powerful and pleasant
sounding.

I have a request for all S2 or 944 S owners.  Email or call Magnecor and
keep the pressure on for them to make a set of spark plug wires for our
cars.  They say they just don't have a suitable spark plug boot that will
work with these engines (or 32-valve 928s) and it could be a while before
they do.

Thanks.
