Hello watercoolers,

I've got the opportunity to buy a 924 GTS or Carrera Turbo. At this point
I'm not sure I'm dealing with the real thing, but the offer sounds too good
to refuse (CHEAP!). I know very little about this car, so I was hoping some
of you could help me out. As far as I understood there were only 400 of
these cars build and it's supposed to deliver 210 Bhp. Is it the standard 2
liter turbo engine with bigger turbo, or is there more to it than just
that? What's a reasonable market price for a decent running one? Any
snakepits or other does & don'ts? Common troubles? Well, you got the
picture… Also can someone provide me with car & engine numbers (or a
reference where I can find these)?
Any info is sure appreciated.

TIA

Jeroen – the Netherlands

Please respond to me directly, I'm not really a member of the watercooled
list…
