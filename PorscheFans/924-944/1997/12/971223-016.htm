As part of my effort to learn as much as I can about 944s, I keep a lot of
notes related to different 944 subjects . Today  I was working on my notes
on 944 timing belt replacements and thought of an interesting question.  On
the earlier cars, you set the initial tension using the tool to 4.0 and
then reset it to its normal running tension of 2.7 after the initial run in
period.  If I remember correctly (and please correct me if I'm wrong), on
the later cars (1987-1991), once the tension is set by the spring
tensioner, it is locked in place and becomes a fixed device. After that, it
must be loosened to retension the belt.  So, the question is, what tension
does the spring tensioner set the belt to? Does it set the belt to 4.0 to
allow for belt stretch, to 2.7 which is the normal running tension, or to
some intermediate value? If anyone happens to know the answer these
questions, please reply to my home e-mail address (fletch@twave.net).

Happy Holidays,
Clark Fletcher
