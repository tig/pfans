Hi Vaugn,

It sounds like you have a very tired and possibly sick high-mileage engine there.  Your 
coolant leak could be anything from bad head gasket to bad valve guides to a cracked 
head.  The oil shouldn't be inside the intake runners either and likely comes from worn 
rings & cylinder walls.  You may be able to finesse it with some sort of a band-aid 
repair but it is likely that the only permanent repair will be a complete overhaul or 
complete replacement.

Sad but true.

Good luck,

All,
I'ld like to nip this one in the bud if possible.  
Twice in the last three days my 951 took three or 
four cranks ("cranks" bein' a redneck term for the
engine turnes over three or four times).  It usually 
starts right up.  It alsoseems to be running a little
 choppier than usual at idle.  My guess is that it
might be the ?flywheel position sensor? (I can't think 
of the exact name).

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Hi Bob & P-Fans
	First check the DME relay. Pry off the plastic 
relay cover and inspect the contacts for burnt damage
 or a solder cold joint. Replace the DME relay if 
necssary. 
	Next check the impulse senders for proper air 
gap and make sure they a tightly secure in place with
 the 10 mm bolt holding them in place. Also by the oil
 fill cap is where the impulse senders plug into the 
cars wiring harness. Make sure that there is no 
corrosion or loose connections. 
	On my 951 the impulse sender connection became
 loose and caused all sorts of weird things to happen,
 ignition ping, rough idle, high idle, eventailly 
the engine stalled out and would not restart. It was
 all a loose impulse connection! 
	Lastly check fuel pressure. See if you are 
loosing residual fuel pressure after you shut the 
engine off. A injestor or the check valve by the 
fuel pump could be bleeding down the fuel pressure 
after a shut down. 
		

				  Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
