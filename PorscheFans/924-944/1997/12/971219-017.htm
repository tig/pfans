Well, I too, am speculating, but since we are in the theoretical realm, I 
would venture to say the the friction is the one component that you want 
to eliminate.

Torque on a fastener is a function of the force of the fastener shoulder 
on the mating surface, not the threads.  You can stretch a fastener as 
more torque is applied, but the pressure between the fastener head and 
mating surface (clamping force) is what you want to hold things together. 
 The dimension by which the fastener stretches is a function of torque 
and what you are trying to control (example would be clamping force of 
the cylinder head on the block).

By using thread lubricant you eliminate the friction variable of the 
threads and improve consistency in clamping force.

It was interesting to note that the installation instructions for the CV 
joints made a point to explain not to have oil on the head of the 
triple-square fasteners or the mating surface.  No mention of oil on the 
threads was given.  I assume you want a clean, dry surface to keep those 
buggers secure.

Bad Bob may be right, although, I am sure some mechanical engineer will 
detail the exact theory which, like all things in life, has its 
exceptions to the rule.
