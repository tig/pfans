Nick and all,
  Possibly the reason vibration was so terrible in my case was due to
bad motor mounts. The vibration was therefore transmitted much more
apparently to the rest of the car.

  I would try removing the belt now but I've still not replaced my
motor mounts so I don't think I'll do it until then.
