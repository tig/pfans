You stated that you had a spring centered disc installed...was it a new
Sachs, or a rebuilt unit??  You might get more driveline noise now than
you did before with a spring centered disc, but you really should not
get vibration.  Are you sure that you do not have a balance shaft
problem??  Were your belts possibly done at the same time??  What are
your motor mouunts like??  Was the T.O. fork inspected??  Was a new
pilot bearing bearing installed??  What are the exhaust mounts like and
were they centered correctly?? etc., etc., etc. 

I probably have done 40-50 clutches on the 924-951 line and I think I
learn something everytime I install one.
