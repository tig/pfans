it seems to me that most of you are seriously maligning the american cars
for being built with the intention of straight line speed instead of great
handling ability.  GRanted, I like my cars to handle as I live in a
mountainous area, but there are those who don't care about how quick you can
make a turn. The reason I don't like most american cars(camaros, mustangs)
is that most of the time you can beat em in a straight line race anyways,
even in a car not purely setup for the straightline(944 turbo).  Although, I
believe that the world class SCCA championship(something along those lines)
has been one the last 2 years in a row by a saleen mustang???  PLEASE PLEASE
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd love to know this is not true.

In a recent post, someone wrote that a mustang pulled up beside him trying
to drag race.  He said he didn't do it, because he did not want to embarass
himself, but then went on to mention how he embarassed the mustang around a
corner.   

However...944s's and 944t's...all seem more than capable of beating these in
both cases.  

OK, enough ramble
