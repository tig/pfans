Some additional information about timing/balance shaft belt replacement.
After I posted my last message, some questions were raised about whether my
information was correct.  I got an e-mail (which I appreciated by the way)
from someone who told me that several of his local shops and one of the
technical writers at Excellence are recommending every 45000 miles.  Well,
I started to doubt my own information so, I decided to call Porsche Cars -
North America to ask "What is the  "official" recommendation" . Here it is:

     1.  Replace the timing and balance shaft belts every 30000 miles.
     2.  After a timing belt replacement, have the tension checked before
1800 miles.
     3.  There is nothing concrete to support that the belts should be
replaced after 3
           years if 30000 miles is not reached. However, the representative
at PCNA        did emphasize that "the cars are meant to be driven" and
agreed that              replacing the belts periodically if the car was
not driven a lot was a good idea.  4.  Porsche does recommend that, for new
cars, a complete check of the car       (including timing belt) be done at
the two year point and yearly thereafter.          This recommendation is
irrespective of the mileage on the car.
     5.  I asked if the recommendation had been 45000 miles. The
representative I         talked to wasn't positive but said that the
recommendation probably was       45000 miles at one time.

Once again, I appreciate the e-mail that questioned my information. If I
ever put out information that someone feels isn't correct, I hope they will
continue to question it. I certainly intend to do the same. If everyone
will that,  we'll minimize the amount of bad information that gets
circulated.  If there are any more questions, feel free to contact me at
"fletch@twave.net" . If anyone wants to verify this information, simply
call Porsche Cars at 1-800-PORSCHE (They don't accept e-mail).
