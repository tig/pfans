I've been sitting here eating my cheerios, and reading the morning
digest before work.  I just about spit cheerios all over the screen when
I read the studded tires on the track post.  You guys crack me up, it's
good to read some funny stuff in with all the technical jargon once in a
while.  The f-16 engine is also very funny, though I've already
installed one in my motorcycle.  I just can't get the wheelies down
right though...keep running into those damn stop light cables. :)

Farzaan, don't worry about the wolves, there is safety in
numbers...especially if some of those numbers own BIG guns.  :)

<< Diagnosis is needed!!! &nbsp;I replaced my power steering pump last
weekend, &nbsp;everything went well, and it was an easy installation.
&nbsp;However, the instructions and my fellow mechanics told me in order to
bleed the lines I just have to turn the steering whell from lock to lock and
I'm done. &nbsp;Well, its not that easy, I'm still having that large groaning
sound when I turn, and I'm wondering if I have some air trapped in there.
&nbsp;Any input would be appreciated. >>

Joe,
You may want to check if it's the upper strut mounts groaning.
