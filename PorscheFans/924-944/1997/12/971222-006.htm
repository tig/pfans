<snip>I have been berated by a list member for asking an unreasonably high 
price for my S2. 

David,

I would hardly worry about a list member who thinks you're asking too much
for YOUR 944.  Something is only worth what someone else will pay for it.
I own an 85.5 944 with 90k miles.  This car looks brand new and is
excellent mechanical condition.  I wouldn't take a penny less than $9000
for it.   If someone didn't like what I was asking for my car I'd tell them
fine, kiss my ass and don't buy it - PERIOD.  I see too many banged up,
ragged out 944's on the street and if someone wants a bargain basement
price then they can buy one of those.  To know a car has been cared for and
has had all required maintenance by the book means a lot to me when I'm
spending my money.

Good luck with the sale!

Regards,
Michael Belfoure
