Check to make sure that your fuel pressure at the fuel rail is within spec.

You might have a fuel pressure regulator problem..

Good Luck!

In a message dated 97-12-19 10:27:36 EST, you write:

<< I think you need to put thread lubricant on to get a real torque reading. 
  If not, then it will not be fully torqued to specification. >>

All,
This is something that should be cleared up immediately.   As far as I know,
clean, dry threads are the only way to torque a bolt/stud to spec and have the
appropriate pre-tension.  

The torque on the bolt/nut/stud is not the critical factor, it's the pre-load
on the bolt/stud.  The torque required to gain the appropriate pre-load on the
bolt/stud is a function of the frictional force between the stud/bolt and nut
at the threads.  

When you lubricate the bolt, you decrease the friction at the threads.
Therefore, at an arbitrary torque (lets say 25 ft-lbs), the acual pre-load on
the bolt/stud may be 150 lbs if it's clean and dry, but will be maybe 200 lbs
if lubricated.  Please not that all these numbers are arbitrary and pulled out
of my head just to explain the point.

This is not so critical on lug nuts, but becomes more important when doing
things like torquing head bolts in an aluminum block.
