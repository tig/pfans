Steve,

I am not sure that is so true.  If you look at what Porsche was offering 
in 1989, the 944 Turbo was the fastest car they offered that year.  It 
even beat out the 928 by a tick.

Any down rating may be more with an eye toward longevity than offending 
other marques.

No doubt that there was some embarrassment that the 944 Turbo was quicker 
than the 911 line of that year, but also check the price on the 944 Turbo 
and you will see that it was just over $50,000 US.  

The demise of the 944/968 line owes more to sagging economies, sport 
utility vehicles, and a need for Porsche to reposition their company in a 
changing market, not so much competition between marques.

For that reason Porsche dropped the front engine design and regrouped.  
The result was a new car called the Boxster.  That car contained the 
genius of lower cost of manufacturing and a marketing plan that embraced 
the "roots of Porsche" theme.  Clearly, the "roots" are quite evident in 
the 986 with its design.  Consolidation of parts with the new 996 help 
turn Porsche around financially.

Cancellation of the front engine marque may be the loss of good car, but 
it could not make Porsche a strong competitor in the sports car market 
that it is today.  Nobody benefits if Porsche were to produce good cars 
at the loss of profitability.  Heaven forbid if Ford or Chrysler would 
buy them out!
