It was a while ago ('88 or so) so my recollections are pretty dim. 

I seem to remember a vibration, particularly at higher revs (4500 or
so), that would probably lead to catastrophic failure of the engine in
fairly short order. It was so bad I didn't want to drive it until I
talked to a mechanic, who immediately diagnosed the problem. (I thought
the timimg belt had slipped a notch or two.) Even then, he had to
reassure me that I could safely drive the car the 10 miles or so to his
shop - I was for getting a tow. At lower revs it isn't so bad,
particularly if you have decent motor mounts. But there is absolutely no
way you could drive it on the track or at an autocross.
