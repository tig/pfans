Hi P-Fans!

Today I noticed that my speedometer got stuck at about 50km/h.
The needle didn't move even at speed changes. Odometer was running.
After stopping the needle was moving *very* slowly down, but did not
reach the lowest position. After 2 minutes of driving everything was
fine again.
It was quite cold this morning, are there any parts affected by that?
What do I want to check to avoid breaking something?

Thanks in advance

<< Now I'm looking at a new car, and have narrowed it down to two choices.
 an 86 944 turbo with 75k miles on it.  Good condition, but it's had a
 lot of aftermarket stuff put on and is supposed to be REALLY fast.  I'm
 not sure what all is on it though.  I can't drive it as the clutch is
 gone.  I can do the change myself, and I am aware of how ridiculously
 long a job this is supposed to be.  I guess if you own a porsche you pay
 the price in time and cash huh? >>

MMathew,
I think the clutch is actually ONLY a 12 hr job.  You should be able to get a
clutch kit for about $500, but would recommend atleast the Sachs Cup clutch
for about $650 I think (?Is that right George B??).

The big problem I see here is the fact that you can't drive it first.  There
is no way in hell I would buy a 951 if I couldn't drive it first, unless it
was a parts car.  Not to say you shouldn't hold out for a 951.  By the way,
what is the asking price??
