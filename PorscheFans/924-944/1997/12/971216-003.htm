Thanks to All,
                 I wanted to thank everyone who made suggestion to me on =
the stuck crank bolt problem. For some reason I was in a fog about how =
to get it off, probably because I broke the cam gear, then after having =
a beer and settling down I realized what I did when I had my shop.  A =
very easy way and possibly one on the safest so I'll post it to the =
list. =20
1) Removed anything which is obstructing the immediate area in front of =
the bolt. ie electric fans, hoses, wires.
2) Do not jack the car up or jack it very little (very important).
3) Use a penetrating lube on the bolt 1 hour before hand, uses very =
liberally
4) using a 1/2 breaker bar and socket attach to the bolt, thus wedging =
the bar against the floor (in my case a 3 foot pipe was also attached to =
the bar so I could wedge it hard.
5) Then tap your engine. I know sounds incredibly simple but since the =
engine rotates in a clockwise direction and the nut/bar is stationary, =
and the starter, which has well over 500lbs of torque rotates the engine =
it breaks free the bolt unscrewing it.
Obviously you want to disconnect the coil prior so your car doesn't =
fire, as well as not removing the timing belt so everything remains in =
synch. Also one additionally comment of the caliper idea mentioned =
yesterday. I use a wood clamp, the type which has two threaded adjusters =
to expand or contract depending on the angle. it allows you to compress =
the piston easily and since its wood it will not cause any damage to the =
piston itself. One last thing....can anyone tell me how to send =
something to the list without all the ^%&@#$ html code showing up after. =
I hate cluttering up the list with it. Thanks again Kevin
