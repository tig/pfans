I wouldn't bother with Windward or PowerHaus for a rebuild.  If they are
doing some hot-rod setup for you, then sure, but just to rebuild, forget
it.  Get a turbo company to do it like Turbo City and the like.  Contact
Dave Buschur at Buschur Racing.  Not only will he get you a great deal
on rebuilding your turbo, but he might be able to hot-rod it a bit
w/o affecting longetivity or durability.  He can do things like clipping
the turbine wheel to reduce backpressure at high RPM (gives a similar
effect as having a larger exhaust housing, like the "S" models have)
and a whole bunch of other little things, remember, he has the fastest
street legal 4-cylinder in North America right now, certified by the
National Hot Rod Association and the AIRA, with a blistering 10.9 @ 125mph
run on street tires in a car that weighs 3000 lbs, all powered by a BIG
turbo on a small 2.0L engine.

Dave doesn't normally do 951 turbos, but tell him I sent you.  If I can
get enough people to push him, we will all benefit from WAY cheaper
prices.  When Dave first entered the Talon business, Imagine Motorsports
was selling Mitsu 16G turbos for US$1000, HKS was selling the same unit
for US$1350, everyone was happy.  Dave came on the market and sold the
same unit for US$700.  Now that his volume is higher, he sells them for
US$650.  Imagine is bankrupt and HKS now sponsors Dave :)  The day of
$650 K27's could be upon us.  Dave sells 3-4 turbos a week for Talon
customers right now!

He can be reached at http://www.buschurracing.com or
