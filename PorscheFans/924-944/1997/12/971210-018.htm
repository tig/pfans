OK, Dave C., now I don't know who's being serious! I live above 7000 ft, so
advancing timing is a big thing in terms of performance. If this could be
done, it would solve the lack of manual control of timing.  I think there
actually is a product that can be added to the 944 cam that does the same
thing.  Only problem is it would be a static fix, as opposed to mapping a
chip. And as Doug D. reminds us, the DME does allow for some leeway in
fuel/timing adjustments. I haven't checked the DME on my S2 to see if the
rotary switch is still there, but I did play with the switch when I
installed a supercharger on a late '85 (and still blew up an engine).  

One question is terms of driving at high altitude. Isn't there a circuit in
the DME that senses altitude and adjusts timing and fuel accordingly? Seems
like I read that somewhere.
