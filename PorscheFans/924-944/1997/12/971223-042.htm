OK guys, I got another one for ya! I just bought a Blaupunk BEA80 to
hook to my RENO. I'm trying to determine the orientation of the power
connectors. Is brown - unshielded connector ground? There is a lead with
2 red wires that has a connector that appears to be 12v+, but I'm not
sure how the Germans do it. There is a third smaller connector that
would appear to go to the pole right above the 12+ connection, but I
would have thought if that were so - a single soild connector with both
connections would make more sense??? Anyone care to give me some
guidance on this?

After I get it working, I have to figure out how to wire in the SAS
Bazooka Subwoofer which now uses the DIN connector that the EQ needs to
use. WHEW?!! Looking for someone who can explain this stuff in plain
english - so that none of my stereo goes POOOF!

Thanks to all for past help!
