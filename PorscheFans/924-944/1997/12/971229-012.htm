I bought a Testor's kit (1/24th scale?) of a 944S.  I think it's the
European version but can be easily modified with some creative superglue
(rocker panels, bumpers, etc) and exacto knife work (sunroof outline) to
look like the USA 944 na.  Mine looks like my 87 944 na.  Getting the paint
to match was the challenge.  These kits go for about $15 in the Pittsburgh
area.  I heard that they go for as low as $5 at the Ebay auction site:
