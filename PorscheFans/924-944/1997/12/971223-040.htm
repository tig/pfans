Probably the easiest thing to do is just find a convenient existing power
lead in the console/dash area (clock, interior light, etc.) and tap off of
it.  You have to decide whether you want your 3 or 4-way adaptor to be
"hot" all the time or just when the ignition is on.  On my '83 944, I had a
radar detector hard wired from the interior light above the rearview mirror
(on the "always hot" side), and it was then a simple job to just tap into
my detector wiring and run additional wires down the "A" pillar and under
the dash.

Another method would be to just tap directly off the battery and run the
wires thru an existing opening in the firewall - just make sure you have an
in-line fuse between the battery and the adaptor.  And, don't forget to
securely mount the adaptor - don't use velcro, as when the adaptor heats
up, the glue holding the velcro starts to melt.  Besides, if you plug and
unplug devices often, you want the adaptor well secured.

BTW, some cell telephone DC adaptors come with a small round plastic piece
that slips over the plug end and makes it fit better in some "foreign"
cars.  It isn't just the depth of the lighter socket that is different, but
also the inside diameter.  This plastic piece acts as a "shim".  You might
visit your local Motorola phone dealer and ask them if they have an extra
one or two (I know that it comes with the adaptor for the standard flip
phone (PCH550?)).

When I'm on vacation in my P-car, I might have all of the following plugged
in at once:  Radar Detector, Cell Phone, CD, and CB.

Hope this helps some.
