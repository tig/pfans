Well, here in Balmy Florida, we change our belts in our garage with the
doors open for circulation so as not to perspire all over our new
belts.  Naturally, we too wish to test our mettle on occasion, and do so
by changing said belts on the beach while distracted by thong bikinis
and silicon augmentation devices.  Although I respect your will and
determination having gone through such rigors and torture as a -41
degree Beltfest, until you've changed a belt in the sun of Florida, with
silicone hanging over each side of the fenders peering in and saying
'nice Porsche...can I ride you, er, I mean ride in it?" you've never
trully proven your manhood.  The problem is keeping the camcorder
pointed at the front of the engine when there's a thong pointed back at
you from the side of the car.  :)

Sorry Roxanne, it had to be said.   :)
