Hello,
I'm a new P-Fun from Poland and a new owner of '84 924. I'm looking for a 
P-Fun-Club in or around my country. Is there one? I'm also looking for the 
electrical scheme of my car.
RGDS, Slavomir Jurzysta.

Well, Nick and Farzaan, I have owned two 911's and two 944's, and for a year I
owned one of each (an 85.5 944 and an 88 911).  I tracked and autocrossed
both, and came to the conclusion that the 944 (especially the S2) is a better
car.  For oone thing, it has a few creature comforts I consider kinda
important, like a defroster that works (important in Seattle).  More
importantly, it just handles better, and feels better at speed.  The real
clincher, though, was the bang for buck calculation.  My 911, with 69K miles,
sold for $25K (exactly what I paid for it two years earlier).  My '89 S2, in
comparable shape, with 51K miles, I bought for $13K.  For this exchange, I got
way  better brakes, including ABS, better handling, better high speed
aerodynamics (try threshold braking a non-spoilered 911 from 135 to 70 going
into bumpy turn 2 at SIR for a real thrill), comparable fit and finish
(actually, better feeling switchgear), far more interior room (try fitting
your race wheels and tires in a 911) and significantly cheaper parts like
transmissions and engines.  A fair trade for the 9 horsepower I gave up.

Don't get me wrong--I love the 911.  I just think the 944 specs out a bit
better, especially for track flogging on a budget.
