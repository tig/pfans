Chris,

If I remember things right:
Your clock has 4 wires: +12V continuously (otherwise the clock would
stop when not                                              driving the
car)
			Ground
			+12V from the ignition-switch to light the light.
			+12V for detecting that the you switched on the lights
			     It dims the light of your clock in the dark.

Why your clock is blank? I don't know. But it could be the rubber
connector between the display and the printed circuitboard. You may try
cleaning it with some tapehead cleaner. (video-head cleaner)
In my clock there's missing one piece of the most right digit.
I've had the clock apart once, but I cannot find the cause. Sometimes
though, when it is very cold outside, the part is working. It quits the
job when the interior heats up.

The solution to the reader problem that I found is to cut the fiche into 1/3
and use the reader/printer at the local library. You can buy your own reader
for fiche this size used for about $20. I made a paper index for mine by
printing out the info at the top of each column. I just look at my index and
then I know which 1/3 I need.
