I did the exact same thing when I bought my 89 Turbo last Winter.  I 
already had two other 944 cars (87 944 and 87 944S) in the garage and one 
adorable blond girlfriend.

I seriously thought about getting a second adorable blond girlfriend, but 
was worried about the excessive maintenance costs.  In the end, I opted 
to sell the 87 944.
