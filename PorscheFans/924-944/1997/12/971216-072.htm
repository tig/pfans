Tom, from my perspective it depends entirely on the warranty. I have my
951S serviced at the dealer and they never object to my supplying the
parts (actually they've come to expect it when they see how much cheaper
I can by parts through the mail). The only part that I always buy from
the dealer is the timing belt because they supply a two year warranty.
If it breaks they pay. Its cheap insurance. Otherwise I mail order the
parts. Also because I'm a PCA member the Porshe dealership gives me a
20% discount that brings the labor rate down to $55 CDN/hr or something
like 25 cents US/hr (these days that is).
