I purchased the first model G-tech.  It's a piece of junk.  The later ones,
the g-tech pro are supposed to be a lot better.  The hardest part about
these units is where are you going to do your testing?  It's pretty
hard to find a good, straight level road that is flat for a 1/4 mile or
more.  Sure, there are highways, but it's pretty dangerous doing standing
starts from the side.  The controls on the unit are horrible on both models.

I'd much rather pay $75 for an hour of dyno time, then to pay $100 for
a g-tech.

The 1/4 mile ET is usually pretty close, but the MPH is off +3mph on the
g-tech.  THe night before I took my Talon to the drags, I did some
testing with the g-tech.  We got 13.23 @ 107mph and 310hp on the reading.
The next day, we ran 13.1 @ 104mph.  Later on, when the car was faster, the
unit would give bizarre readings when I'd launch with the AWD.  It seems
the unit can handle about 1.2g max at launch, any more and it gives
funny readings.  The next runs I did got 12.9 @ 119mph and readings like
450hp!  The car really ran 12.7 @ 107 and likely had about 340-350 flywheel
HP.

Hope that saves someone from wasting their money like I did.  BTW - the
Vericom units are MUCH better and repeatable, but about 8X more expensive.

Farzaan.
