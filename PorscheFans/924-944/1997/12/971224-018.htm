Hey gang:

Even though it breaks my heart to see it go, major changes in my 
personal life are forcing me to sell my baby.  I thought that I might as 
well try to advertise it here.  I am working on getting pictures scanned 
which I will be putting on a webpage.  Drop me a note if you're 
interested, so I can let you know as soon as that's done.

I will be more than happy to show it to anyone interested in buying it.  
I'm in Northern Colorado, but it shouldn't be a problem to work 
something out for anyone wanting to see it along the front range.

Porsche 951 (944 turbo) '86, garnet red (burgundy), black leather, 110K 
miles, full service rec, dlr maint, always garaged, excellent mech cond, 
few cosmetical flaws, pwr sunroof, pwr steering, pwr windows, pwr driver 
seat, very good Dunlop A/S tires, phone dials, 2nd owner (both owners 
PCA members) for 6mths. Please call (970)407-8284.

btw: If anyone knows of pages with Porsche specific wanted/for sale ads, 
please drop me a note!  Thank you very much in advance.

Best regards,
Chris
