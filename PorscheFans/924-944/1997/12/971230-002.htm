One thing to check might be the thermal vacuum switch that acts like a =
choke on the CIS system. My '79 924 had the same problem you describe, =
unfortunately it did prove to be a blown head gasket. Depending on where =
the gasket has let loose, coolant either goes into the oil pan (say =
bye-bye bearings) or out the exhaust if it's leaking into the =
compression chamber. If it is leaking into the compression chamber, then =
shutting down a hot engine would let hot water vapor into the =
compression chamber, and an open intake valve would allow the water =
vapor to condense on the intake manifold/plenum. The vacuum switch is =
probably a long shot. Another sure sign of a blown head gasket is =
excessive amounts of water vapor in the exhaust. Kind of a subjective =
test as it's difficult to quantify 'excessive'. A compression check is =
more quantifiable. Spark plugs can tell you a whole lot about what's =
going on in an engine.=20
