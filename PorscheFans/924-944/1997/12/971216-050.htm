I do not know about the 5W-30 recommendation, sounds too light, but I have
not read the article yet.

As far as the Valvoline synthetic is concerned, it has been Porsche
approved for a while and when I bought my 944S it was the oil the car had
in it.  I feel it resisted thinning out better than Mobil 1 as I never saw
the oil pressure drop below 3.5 bars, the Mobil 1 15W-50 occasionally got
down to 3 and once I saw it at 2.5 in the summer after a great ride
through some Missouri hills. 

One reason why more are not using Mobil 1 may be product distribution,
more appropriately lack thereof.  Plain Valvoline is ubiquitous, Mobil 1
can be found with a little more search.  Synthetic Vavloline is darn hard
to find, at least in St. Louis.  I wanted to keep my car on Valvoline as
it had been running on that for years, so I gave up and switched to Mobil
1 which I could find at most places.
