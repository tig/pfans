The thread on "beltfest" is interesting.  The gentleman from Canada probably
does not see the humor in "thong" bikini's since he probably has never seen
one and therefore does not know what they are.  The summers in Minnesota
are so short that the thong has barely made it here let alone in Canada
(tee-hee).

<shrug> They changed the law here a year or so ago... women can be topless
in public *anywhere*, *anytime*, which makes thong bikinis at least 50%
less usefull...

Mind you, as soon the law passed, it quickly became known that any
enterprising businessfolk wishing to hire, er, "greeters" at street level,
would face morals charges if said greeters weren't fully clothed.

So... women can go topless in the streets, but getting paid to go topless
is a morals charge... prostitution is legal, but soliciting is a criminal
offence... next thing you know health care will be free and guns will be
highly restricted... <cough>

Obligatory P-car content:
I received my S2 magnecors just before Christmas. one wire is too short and
the coil wire has an incorrect "end" on it (I think). I e-mailed them but
"the" Magnecor guy for non-cataloged apps is away on vacation until Jan
6th, and I'm in the queue to talk to him (I said I'd wait). Full story
coming after...
