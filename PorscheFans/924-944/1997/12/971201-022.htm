If you feel adventuresome and own a soldering iron and a multimeter, 
remove the cover of the relay and have a look inside.  Things you can do 
to possibly fix the relay yourself are:

1.  Check that all the soldered connections inside the relay are sound.  
If not, have at it with the soldering iron.

2.  The actual contacts themselves can burn away to the point of losing 
contact.  If there is sufficient material left, they can often be cleaned 
up with some fine sandpaper.  Otherwise you will have to replace the relay.

3.  Check to see the coils have continuity.. if not, you are out of luck.

Someone on the list a _long_ time ago posted they had replaced the fan
relay with individual, inexpensive relays, but I no longer have the post. 
I imagine this could be done with a wiring diagram and some ingenuity. 

I usually try to fix an expensive Porsche part before throwing up my 
hands and replacing it.  I am still running on a fixed horn, and a fixed 
flasher relay (contacts crudded up, and a bad solder joint).
