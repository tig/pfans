Here is something really scary.

When 944s were new, Porsche, at least in the UK, did not specify any
replacement period for the cam belt! As can be imagined, the result was
carnage.

My last car (an '83) was one of these (albeit, before I owned it). At about
55k, its belt lost a tooth or two, resulting in 8 bent valves and split
guides. The car had been serviced annually (at about 10k miles a year) by
AFN - a main agent south of London. By that time (88-ish) the cam belt was
specified for replacement at 40 or 45k (not at a 12k service interval --
strange). AFN had missed the need to do this on my car, and after some
pressure had been exerted on them, they agreed to meet the cost of all
remedial work! Note: AFN is owned by Porsche Cars GB!

It seemed that someone at Porsche had seen the error of their ways.
