  Tonight I've done some sleuthing. A few weeks ago I posted that I'd 
fixed a poor gas mileage problem that I thought was due to a 
crankcase vacuum leak. As it turned out I was wrong. I still have the 
problem. Tonight I checked the DEE system.

  The air flow sensor checks out with >8 volts. The air flow sensor 
door switch however does not. Specified voltage is
    door closed   250-260 mV        I get 185 mV
    door open      4.6 V                 I get 300mV

  The other components check out...engine temp switch, and throttle 
switch. 

  So according to Haynes I should chuck the air flow sensor and get a 
new one. This is also consistent with the manual stating that a DEE 
system fault can increase gas consumption(running rich due to the 
fault?). Has anyone else experienced this? Anything else I should 
look for? Can this be fixed by cleaning the contacts inside the 
sensor?

  I'll call tomorrow for a price on a new sensor but does anyone have 
a ballpark what this will set me back for just the part as I can 
install it?
