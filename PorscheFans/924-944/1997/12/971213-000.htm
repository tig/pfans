>I can also hear the mechanism working.  Releases the left side with no

raise the hatch myself, I can live with that but it would be nice if it
released both latches as it should.  The first time the right side didn't=

release I was quite pissed.  Why?  This is going to sound real "feminine"=

but I broke 3 fingernails when I tried to lift and only one side was
released.  Please no comments about that.  My stance is that blondes in
Porsches must look good at all times.

Roxanne,
Glad to see that you do not take offence to the kidding.  I taught my
daughter how to use tools at a early age.  She has managed to bruise a fe=
w
male egos by fixing things faster and better than they could.

When my car was newer, the hatch would raise automatically when the butto=
n
was pushed.  Then one fateful day it would not go up automatically, it
required a little nudge.  I replaced the shocks and spent hours adjusting=

the mechanism to no avail.  I finally turned it over to my mechanic who h=
ad
no better luck than I did.   I suspected the rubber gasket had lost its
spring but never got around to changing it.  While working on the
mechanism, I found that over tightening the bolts that hold the release
mechanisms  can cause binding.  Also if the the hatch requires quite a bi=
t
of force to close, the pressure of the locking pins may be holding the
mechanism from releasing.

Unsnap the carpet that covers the mechanisms.  Have an able bodied
assistant push the release while you lounge in the cargo area.  See if th=
e
non releasing mechanism is being actuated or if it is binding.  If I
remember the metal arms that run to the release motor are connected with
those plastic connections that like to break.  Make sure both of the
locking pins are adjusted so the hatch just closes snuggly.
