Have run into some trouble getting the pwr steering and alt drive 
belts off. I'm trying to get the timing belt cover completely off so 
I can get a good look at everything. On the PS tensioning rod one of 
the lock nuts will loosen only so far then is simply spins on the 
threads. I have not been able to loosen either of the alt lock nuts. 
They're soaking in penetrant now. Funny thing is that none of the 
nuts look like they've ever been removed ie theres no wear on them 
(that is until I got a hold of them). How does the real mechanic get 
them off?

If anybodys out there I would appreciate a quick reply so I don't 
have to put this thing back together without doing what I set out to 
do.

Thanks,
