Hi Joe and other listers,

Thanks for your prompt response. I'm glad you're driving your car enough to
"get a feel for it." About the cracked firewall, it really comes from doing
alot of city driving, which is what I do most.

The first symptoms in mine were:

1. Clutch pedal "sticks" when pushed in.
2. Leaking clutch master cyl.
   --and you can tell this because this cyl. shares the brake fluid reservoir
     with the brake booster AND THE PARKING BRAKE LIGHT ON THE CONSOLE
     ACTUALLY FLICKERS! Can you believe it? I thought I had a short!

This is a pretty labor intensive fix, too. What they did on mine was this:

1. Took out both brake and clutch master cyls.
2. Custom-machined a 1/4 inch thick steel plate to fit over the cracked
firewall area.
3. Machined holes for the cyls. to fit through.
4. Riveted onto firewall in loo of welding.

The problem after the fix was that the added plate changes the geometry of the
clutch pedal travel, so "one of the rods" between the pedal and the clutch
master cyl. (maybe the piston?) has to be "filed" or the pedal travels down
and REALLY STICKS.

Anyway, I hope this never happens to yours. It cost me nearly $600 to fix.
Then the rubber centered clutch went out 2 mos. later! I now have a SACHS
plate with a Centerforce spring centered disk. Had this done in June and feels
kind of "racy" but I've grown used to it and the mechanic said the setup is now
just about "bullet-proof." (I just knocked on wood). The clutch job plus the
kit was another $1,500.

Another CRAZY fix I can share with early 944 owners is the following.
About a year ago, after an evening of dining and dancing into the wee hours, I
got up one morning with a splitting headache.
Most of you are probably very keen on every little noise your car makes, so
you can imagine how a headache compounds the effect of a bothersome car sound.
So there I was, with a splitting headache, driving to run some errands and I
noticed a loud hum coming from the back of the car. At first I thought it was
the fuel pump, so impulsively, I went and ordered one and had it put in
without a thought.
Well, the sound didn't go away. Incidentally, I had just had the exhaust
replaced so I figured it was a vibration from the aftermarket muffler that I
would just have to live with.
So live with it I did, and I HATED IT. Not only when I had a headache, but all
the time. Sitting at lights, etc.
About a week ago, the car started hesitating. Took it in, and guess what the
mechanic found? Apparently, there is a net in the fuel tank, to prevent debris
from reaching the fuel filter (also had changed that, BTW). The car is 14
years old, and over time, you can imagine how DIRTY this net was. Took it out,
cleaned it, and the noise is GONE! It's like having another car now.

In four years I've only put Chevron premium gas with techron in the car, but I
guess those big tanks under the gas stations must have a reasonable amount of
dirt in them to deposit in the car's fuel tank over 14 years!

Happy motoring to all!

Luis
