Up until now I had only been on the FC3S(Mazda RX7 turbo) list.  It's
actually quite a bit like this.  Generally stays on topic...usually
helps with problems, and mostly about performance upgrades.  Pretty good
group of people.   You all seem just as close...though I detect a not of
aggression towards the 911 people. :)   I always envied the 3rd
generation rx7 owners.  oh well.


Eventually wrecked my rx7 turbo. :)
Now I'm looking at a new car, and have narrowed it down to two choices.
an 86 944 turbo with 75k miles on it.  Good condition, but it's had a
lot of aftermarket stuff put on and is supposed to be REALLY fast.  I'm
not sure what all is on it though.  I can't drive it as the clutch is
gone.  I can do the change myself, and I am aware of how ridiculously
long a job this is supposed to be.  I guess if you own a porsche you pay
the price in time and cash huh?
Second choice is an 89 rx7 turbo.  Bone stock, but with about a $1500
stereo systemI'm considering this one more seriously as I know more
about rotaries than I do piston engines.  Besides, all this talk about
timing belt tensioning, valve guides, valves, and the THOUSANDS of other
parts in the engine is almost making me wary.
They are both the same price, except that the porsche will require
another ~450(sound right?) for a clutch package.

My question is this...Do any of you have any experience with the two
cars?   Anyone compare them?  I like the porshe a lot, but I just don't
know much about the engine and the fact that its supposed to take 23
hours to change the clutch is making me wonder about other maintenace
type stuff. Does anyone have any articles about the car or even a
comparison if available that you could forward?  I would love to see how
others felt about the two.

OK, thanks for the bandwidth, and sorry if I've wasted your time.
