Subject: Why did the new clutch quiet the gear noise?
 
snip....
 
would go away when I replaced the clutch.  Sure enough it did, but I don't
understand why.  I was pretty sold on the bad bearing idea & I cannot
figure out why a separated clutch plate would cause such a noise.  Could
someone please explain?
 
By the way.  Does anyone have a good use for a used pressure plate?  As
far
as I can tell the old one is in great shape but I replaced it as a matter
of course.
 
Thanks
dave randolph.

1) Bad throwout bearings make that noise.  Not always critical, but will
eventually fail.
2) pressure plates make nice dinner plates or clocks.  Might be too heavy
for the dishwasher.
