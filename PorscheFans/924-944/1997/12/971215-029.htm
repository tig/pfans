Sounds a lot like the hassle I had with Vertex. Bought a rebuilt 2.5 liter
that had one balance shaft inverted, pitted valve stems, valve seats that
had be wrecked, and cracked lifters.  Took a long time to get that one
sorted out, particularly the vibration caused by the balance shaft.  Last
time I do business with that shop.  Porsche Express prices are too good now
to take chances with places that just don't care about quality service.
