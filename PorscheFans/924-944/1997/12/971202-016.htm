  I had my dash apart last weekend, and couldn't find the knob for the heater 
fan speed switch while re-assembling. I finally gave up looking, then heard a 
crunch as I backed out of the garage. Needless to say, I now need a new one. 
Does anyone out there have such a beast they are willing to part with? It is 
the round knob with the fan blade graphics on it, I am not looking to pay a 
fortune for it.

  On a related topic, I removed the A/C switch that no longer stayed in when 
depressed. Upon disassembly, I quickly found the problem. There is a small, 
and I mean small, white nylon piece that rests on a post cast out of plastic. 
This tiny plastic post had broken, so I replaced it with a metal post. The 
switch now works about 20% of the time, so either I didn't center the 
replacement post correctly, or other parts are worn. Has anyone on this list 
performed such a repair? Other than the latching mechanism, the switch is of 
high quality. I am in no hurry for this repair, it is winter, and the 
compressor and/or expansion valve are also shot.

Thanks!
       Ezra
