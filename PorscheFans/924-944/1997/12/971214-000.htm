In my order of preference (all available from Classic Motorbooks, they're
on the 'net somewhere too)

R.M. Clarke, editor. "Porsche 944 Gold Portfolio 1981-1991" Brooklands
Books ISBN 1 85520 2352
- a compilation of road tests from magazines reprinted in black & white.
Doesn't have *all* the tests ever published, but will have a lot you've
never read before... from American, British, Australian, NewZealand, South
Africa, etc., magazines. I always find contemporary road tests interesting.
Unlike some other Brooklands compilations, there appear to be enough 944
road tests around that Mr. Clarke can pick and choose - my favourite Road &
Track S2 vs 300ZX test isn't reprinted, but an S2 vs 300ZX test from
"Autosport" is... (There are separate Portfolios for 924's and 928's. I
don't think there is a 968 one.)

The next three are all the 924/944 books I know that are still readily
available. They're all pretty much the same and I can't really see buying
all three (although I obviously did :-). All are fairly complete but
disagree on minor issues of the early 924 story - how much VW, how much
Audi, etc. None of them make any mention of the still-born 942 targa, for
instance, and only the Cotton book makes any mention of the
Peugeot-Renault-Volvo V6 experiment, albeit only one line.

Michael Cotton, "Porsche 924 and 944" Motor Racing Publications, 1990 ISBN
0-947981-46-2
I picked this one first because it is reasonably new, includes the S2, and
doesn't waste space (for me) talking about the 928 or general Porsche
history. The book has a British slant. Best section on racing 924's and
944's, has hidden gem quotes like "There is scope, Herr Freund agrees, to
go to 3.2 or even 3.4 litres with the 944S2 'but there are no plans to do
so', With a little imagination, though, one can foresee the arrival of a
2.7l, or even a 3.0l turbo model." End section on how to buy a used
924/944. The main drawback to this book is its relatively small format
means small pictures, and there are no colour pictures. Best text, imho.
Does NOT cover the 968.

David Vivian, "Porsche 924.928.944.968" The Crowood Press, 1993 ISBN 1
85223 483 0
Another British effort. The newest of the three and the only one to cover
the 968. 968 CS specs are given, but there is no accompanying text. It
appears that *all* the appropriate tests from "Motor" magazine are
reprinted. Large 928 section (wasted on me). Colour photos section appears
to be all Porsche GB promotional shots (a *purple* 968 cab. Bleck.) End
section on the state of Porsche internal politics, 1992. Larger than
Cotton's book, but actually less content of interest to me. Contemporary
road tests from Motor interesting and reprinted in full (and often).

Jerry Sloninger, "Porsche 924 928 944" Osprey Publishing, 2nd ed., 1987
ISBN 0-85045-776-9
This was the first (and for a long time, the only) 924/944 book, and I put
this last because I'm not sure if the book is still available or my edition
is up to date - it stops with the 944S. Its age works against it. Jerry was
Christophoros editor at the time, and the book kinda reads like Christo of
that era (surprise!) - one gets the feeling one is reading the "official"
word, true or not. Same physical size as Vivian's, colour photo section,
relatively small 928 section.

My 0.02...
Craig.
