Hi P Fans,
First of all, Merry Chrystmas and a Happy New Year to you all and your P.
As the server (?) of the diggest seems crazy again, I hope not be a victim
of a cheeseheads attack :-).
I have some very inocent questions (I´m not very experienced with P cars, I
hope you hunderstand).
1- Where can I get the Haynes manual for a 924 (84 model year). I´ve
browsed the net trying to find it, without sucess, before ask you. It just
don´t exist? Does exist a work manual for this car?
2- Soon it will be time to replace the pads of my beloved P. I´ve learned a
lot about this, reading
others posts. Here in Portugal I´ve never seen these pads you talk about,
Metal Masters. The pads that I´m running are Jurid. Other expensive options
are Texstar, and less expensive Mintex. I´m thinking to put Jurid again,
but I would like some more braking performance. I just do street use of
this car, but run fast in the highway. What are yours experiences?
3- I would like to increase the performance of this car, but, more
important, maintain reliability. I was thinking about a K&N air filter. How
much more HP I can expect? What is the price of these kind of goods? What
else can I do in order to increase HP?
4- And last but not least, the biggest problem I have with this car is the
exaust. Since 8 months I have the car, I welded it for about 6 (!) times in
diferent places. It seems that it just don´t handles well with the bumpy
roads we have in Portugal. I would like to know if there are other P owners
that have to deal with this problem. If I substitute the exaust, can I
expect any HP increase, without the noise that some ones use to do? Which
are the best ones?
I would really appreciate some input about this 4 questions. These group
have been an excelent source of information. Thanks a lot.

The simplest way I've found as a temporary fix, is to wedge a small piece of
non-corregated cardboard between the plug and the outlet. This keeps the plug
from popping back out. 

As a permanent fix, assuming there's room behind the plug, I'd just remove the
outlet and replace it with a new lighter/outlet assembly from an auto parts
store. They all seem to be about the same size and you probably wouldn't need
to modify the dash.
