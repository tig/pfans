>==================================

BTW, this is the same Peter Morgan who is coming out with a second book on
the Water Pumpers, due out sometime real soon.  I'm not sure if it is a
completely new book or an updated version of the first one, but I know it
should have some later models in it - specifically, my "ex" 944 Turbo S
Limited Edition will be the pictured example of that particular model.
Also, an '89 944S2 from Chicago Region PCA should be in it.  Peter is
supposed to send me an autographed copy when finished, which will make for
a nice "momento" of my "U-Boat".

Another BTW
In honor of all the fine people on this list, I think I have come up with
the "ultimate" personalized license plate for my new ride - "PFAN 968".
How does that sound???
