<Some mods that are illegal in most classes snipped>

<<Something I have not tried yet:  I have been told by reliable sources
that the balance shafts consume 5 horsepower at high revs. I cannot see
a reason why you could not just remove the balance shaft belt. The
vibration can`t be that bad, there is a ton of 2.5 L engines in cars
without them. This is obviously personal preference. Has anyone tried
it? How did it work out?>>

I lost the balance shaft belt in my NA 944 once and I thought it was the
end of the world. There is no way the car is drivable without this
little goody. Porsche paid royalties to Mitshubishi for every 944 sold
for a reason...

BTW, thanks for the hints. I am forwarding them to the head of protests
for SCCA Solo II Nationals and a few SCCA club racing scrutineers.
Perhaps they can put them to good use...
