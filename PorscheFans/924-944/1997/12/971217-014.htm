The gentleman was referring to the rear shocks on his car. It is virtually
impossible, even after marking the camber bolt position, to reinstall a
strut without changing camber. Certainly an alignment would be in order when
changing front struts. Changing the rear shocks should not change any
alignment spec. unless ride height is changed significantly.

Try this. Check the camber setting of your car. Now lower the car. What
happens, negative camber increases. Now raise the car back to it's original
ride height. What happens, negative camber decreases.

Try this. Check the camber setting of your car. Place a jack under the rear
and start jacking so that both wheels are raised at the same time. What
visually will start to happen to the camber of the rear tires?

Raising or lowering ride height does indeed have an affect on camber. Will a
small change in ride height have a big impact, probably not. My point merely
was that high pressure shocks can tend to raise ride height on some cars. If
that ride height change was going to change any setting it would likely be
camber and possibly a bit of toe.
