Diagnosis is needed!!!  I replaced my power steering pump last weekend, 
everything went well, and it was an easy installation.  However, the
instructions and my fellow mechanics told me in order to bleed the lines I
just have to turn the steering whell from lock to lock and I'm done.  Well,
its not that easy, I'm still having that large groaning sound when I turn,
and I'm wondering if I have some air trapped in there.  Any input would be
appreciated.
