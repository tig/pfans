You should be able to get a Haynes manual from any well-stocked auto book
store. If there aren't any in your neighbourhood, try www.autoatlanta.com,
www.tweeks.com, or www.performanceproducts.com (I think?).

Replace the throttle body! I did this on mine (as well as the K&N), and it
gave a very significant improvement. It cost me $100 used, and even with my
limited mechanical skills I was able to install it myself. Probably the
modification with the highest bang/buck ratio.
