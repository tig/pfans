Hello Clark,

>       Don't rush out and replace those timing belts just yet. Since our
 
Let me ask you one simple question:

> hydraulic tensioner. When checking the condition of the belts at the normal
> service intervals they must have no cracks, gouges, oil, fuel or coolant
> damage or contamination  and the roller and gears are not pitted or gouged.

That inspection requires removing all the parts that are in the way. In
other words, to do the inspection, or to REPLACE the belts, requires
just about the same amount of work. The price of the timing belt is
like $8. The balance belt is much more, a whopping $27 (8 valve prices
quoted because I'm most familiar with them). The belts in Tom's car are
now about 9 years old. Don't you think it makes sense to spend $35 to
have NEW belts installed?  Or do think it makes better fiscal sense to
just ignore it, and risk a $2000+ repair if the timing belt fails.

Here's one other piece of information. Tom's 'new' car has around 30k
miles. That averages less than 4K miles / year, or about 300 miles
a month. Very little miles. I would be willing to be that the car 
has spent much of it's time sitting. That is not good for the oil
seals. I'll be willing to bet that once that car starts getting driven
on a regular basis, the oil seals will start to leak. So, while you're
getting the timing belt CHANGED, have the shop take a good long look
at the oil seals, especially the cam, crank, and oil pump. If the
seals are dry and brittle, you might as well change them now.

Regarding prices, You can get the entire belt and roller kit from
Vertex or Zimms for less than $150. An oil seal kit is around $50.
So for $200 in parts you can change all the seals, all rollers, 
and the belts. If the shop wants to charge you much more than that,
tell the shop to buy the parts from Zimms, and you'll pay them 
a premium on top of that. The shop deserves to make some money,
but they should make most of the money on the hourly work.

I don't believe it has. Timing belt maintenance, like choice of oil, 
is not a black and white item. My own personal belief (if anyone
cares) is to change the belt every 3 years or 45K miles, whichever
comes first. On that basis, the belt change will cost you around
$100 a year, or $1 for every 150 miles. If you can't afford that,
then either change the belt yourself, or get a different car.
