Hello all!

My first post, I really enjoy the list.  After about 10 years of   
yearning, may
soon (this week) actually own my first 944.  It is an 86 951 in need of   
tires.
I want to buy all season tires and came across another list member that   
has
a new set of BFG's M+S to sell since he is in sunny Florida (I am in   
Dayton, OH).
To the important stuff: they are 225/50/16 F and 245/50/16 in the back.   
 Yes, 50
in the back.  He and I both know that 45 is recommended, but he says that   
they
fit fine and I believe him.  I was wondering if any members have any   
thoughts on
this fit and speedometer error etc  It would save me tons of money thanks   
to his
great price!  I guess worst case I could buy the 225/50/16 only and put   
them on
the back, and buy new fronts.

Another question, does anyone have the Excellence back issue (#37 I   
think) that
deals with buying a used 944?  It is sold out!
