Hi guys, I posted this letter I wrote to Carlsen Porsche about their
snubbing of the watercooled Porsches in their merchandising flyer. For some
reason it got to the nondigest people but got left off the digest and
archive. This happens sometimes when the mail is sent late in the day.
Anyway, I'll repost it here for your reading pleasure.
To : Management of Carlsen Porsche,

From: Norbert Pohl, potential customer,

Dear sir,=20
	I recently received a brochure for some Christmas gift ideas from your
organization. At first I was pleased and excited as I have many friends who
own Porsche=92s and a catalog of reasonably priced gift ideas would be a
godsend. As I read the brochure, my happiness quickly turned to annoyance
as there was not a single item which even acknowledged the existence of the
models of Porsche designated 924-944-968-928, otherwise known as
=91=92waterpumpers=92. This is not the first time I have noticed the purpose=
ful
exclusion of an entire wing of the Porsche hall of fame. I can only assume
that it was deliberate act designed to suck up to the "Real Porsche=92s Are
Oilcooled " mindset that seems to be more prevalent since the
discontinuance of the front engined, watercooled models. Surely there are
products, t-shirts-models-coffeecups-keychains, that depict the huge
numbers of very "real" Porsche=92s that the genious=92s at Zuffenhausen and
Stuttgart saw fit to put the family crest on.=20
	As an active PCA member, and a daily contributor to the Porshefans
internet club, I know that there is a huge number of proud watercooled
Porsche owners in the Bay Area that have a lot of money to spend. There are
over 1400 subscribers to the 924-944-968 email list, not to mention 928=92s,
and at least =BD of the 1255 members Golden Gate Region of the PCA own one o=
f
these models. When I mentioned this issue to the email list today, I got an
immediate response from dozens of others who express similar annoyance at
the elitist attitude of a few Porsche dealers and parts suppliers who chose
to ignore this large market. A few even called for a boycott of your Parts
Express service, although I=92m not ready to go that far. I=92m sure you wil=
l
realize that it doesn=92t make sense to neglect a large potential group of
customers in order to please a few elitists who need to belittle our cars
in order to justify the greater cost of the 911 models and feed their ego=92=
s
 And I know that paraphenalia for our cars exists, so I=92m sure you would
like to reconsider your marketing tactics and solve this oversight on your
part. If not, please remove my name from your mailing list as I have no use
for 911 coffee cups, or elitist car dealerships.

Norbert J Pohl
Proud owner of a 1988 PORSCHE 944 Turbo and frequent buyer of parts.

P.S. I=92m sure you realize that owners of used Porsches often become buyers
of new Porsches.
