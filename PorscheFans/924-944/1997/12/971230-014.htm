Alex,
I was under there just last night. The plastic panel just covers some
harnesses like you said, not the DME. Don't know part number.

Don't know.

That's right.

I don't think I have a black box bolted to the firewall. I know I don't
have an alarm.

Does anyone know of a good Porsche repair shop (independent preferebly) in
Colorado, west of Denver (Denver will be too long of a drive) I will be moving
to Grand Lake, and working at Winter Park, so if there is a shop in that
general area, I'd love to know about it. Also, how do you go about changing
your PCA region?? I really hope my baby lives through the snow!!!
Thanks
