Howdy dudes,

The Kart stuff is coming along nicely.  I went and had my race suit fitted.
The factory Sparco sizes fit perfect.  The guy behind the counter claimed:
"You are the first person to perfectly fit a Sparco racing suit that I've
seen!"  He felt that I had the perfect racer's body.  Those who have seen
me will know what I'm talking about :)

Anyhow, all that stuff is coming along nicely.  Paul just bought his kart
so he'll be joining me in that too.  We will still auto-x and track our
944Ts as they are a hoot!

Now, onto some serious business.  I was selling a set of chips for an 89
944T and had them sold, but the guy has dissapeared from the face of the
earth, so I'm offering them again.  APE chips for 88(S) or 89+ 944T's
with 1bar boost bolt and instructions on how to install, etc.  Will also
throw in a K&N if you want it, all for US$200.

Now that Paul has bought his Kart, he has to pay for it!  So, he is selling
his beautiful forged turbo S wheels.  These were recently stripped and
re-painted in Volvo 850 T5-R wheel color, a cool charcoal dark gray.  They
would look SWEET on a white, red or silver car, or any color car for that
matter.  You can see the brake discs glow red on the track because of the
contrast of the wheels.  He wants US$1450 + shipping for them.  The price
includes (2) 16x7 wheels and (2) 16x9 wheels and (2) 225/50R16 Kuhmo race
tires (brand new) and (2) 245/45R16 Kuhmo race tires (almost new).

I will have pictures available on the net so that you can see how clean they
are yourselves.  All wheels are prefect round.
