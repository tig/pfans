Hey all,

     I think someone posted something about this before, but I can't 
remember what the response was...

     I have an '88 951S that I purchased a couple months back, and at 
speeds above 60mph or so, the steering wheel vibrates noticeably. It 
seems like this only happens when the car is very cold (or I could just 
be hallucinating). Going over large rough bumps in the road also causes a 
metallic rattling sound that seems to be coming from the steering 
column/dash area. I recently mounted/balanced new Toyos on all 4 wheels, 
so I don't think the front wheels need balancing...I've also just 
replaced the control arms with Fabcar units and re-aligned the car. The 
steering also still has a little bit of play in them (maybe tierods are 
worn out too?). The car likes to "jerk" around sometimes too...it's hard 
to drive the car without both hands firmly on the wheel at all times. 
Anyone have any idea what could be wrong? Do I need a new steering rack? 
Is that what the rattling sound is? Ugh, I don't have any ideas left (and 
the wheel bearings are fine too, already checked those).

Also, anyone have any experience with carrerra or porsche cup complete 
coil-over kits on their personal cars? is it too rough on the street? I 
had a '95 M3 that I put a groupN racing coil-over kit on with carrera 
camber plates/aluminum strut bearing which I thought was fine driving 
day-to-day (but everyone else thinks it was too rough). It seems to me 
that the 944's suspension design is a little older than the M3s, and 
maybe is not at good at absorbing and disappating bumps as well as the 
M3, but I'm curious as to just how rough this coil-over setup would be on 
the car...

please reply to me personally, as I'm in digest mode...thanks for any 
info in advance :)

regards,
David

Subject: favorite racing videos?


PFans --

As the holiday season approaches (Season's Best to all, BTW), I'm getting
the usual requests concerning what I'd like that isn't too expensive (i.e.,
something besides a set of new R1s or a Quaife).  I thought maybe a racing
video might help get me thru the offseason (or make it worse). Anyone have
any favorite videos on road course racing that are reasonably instructive?

TIA.
