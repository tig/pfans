Hi P-Fans,

Got another twist on this idea.  Instead of drilling your flywheel, cut some
threads onto the reference dowel.  Locktite a half-nut (a regular size nut
could also be used, but I would go with the lightest option) so that it's
flush with the end of the dowel and the widest part of the nut (corner to
corner) is parallel with flywheel rotation.  VERY IMPORTANT PART: Check
reference sensor air gap!  You will _more_than_undo_ what you have just done
if the clearance in inadequate.  Proportional to the width of the nut, this
will advance both timing and ignition with it's resultant fuel
requirememnts. Admittedly, this will advance the maps a set number of
degrees across the entire range, so it is crude in that respect.  Hopefully
the chip designers are doing more than this ;-)

YMMV,

-Bill
