Dear fellow Pfans,
   My weakest link in car repair skills is electrical (and that ain't
sayin' a whole lot! :), and I was hoping someone might be able to steer
me in the right direction for solving this problem.  I recenty lost all
park lights on my '87 951.  I noticed it when the I had my fog lights on
with the park lights and glanced down to notice the little green light
had gone out.  (All fuses check out fine!) 
  I turned on my headlights and they work w/ high beam and my fog lights
work again when the headlights are on only, not with the park lights.  I
have no tailights or front marker lights at ANY time, and my headlights
have never concealed after that first turn on to check them out.
Incidently, the "car off side marker lights" activated by the turn
signal lever do actually illuminate the park lights for their respective
side.   
  Can anyone suggest where the problem area might be found based on
these characteristics?   
  Many thanks for any help!,
                Michael in Indy
