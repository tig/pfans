Always looking for a bit more power for the "I" stock club racer, I queried
some 944 ITS folks about taking the balance shaft belt off and running
without......they agreed that there was an increase in performance as they
had run this way for a while.  They put the belt back on because they
started cracking fuel rails and couldn't keep a starter bolted in.   These
were the most obvious prooblems from running without the belt.  They figured
the problems caused were not worth the power gained.......

Happy Holidaze to all........

Hello Jay & P-Fans,
	When you performed the compression test, what was the reading on the first
compression stroke? Did your gauge read 180 psi on the first compression
stroke? Or did the gauge start out low and then pump up to the high reading of
180 psi. 
	ei: 140 - 160 - 170 - 175 - then 180 psi ? If your engine takes several
compression stokes to get to the highest reading - that means your rings are
worn! But if the readings start out high ( say 170, then go up to 180 psi)
that would indicate the rings are ok. You can always add a say 8 oz. of oil to
the cylinder before doing a compression test and see if the compression
readings start out higher than the previous readings. 

					Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Subject: oil burn

Good morning all,

I would like to throw this situation out to the collective and see what
kind of ideas you all have.  My (modified) 1982 924 is burning oil.  I have
verified that the valve stem seals are shot by running up to 4k rpm in 4th,
then just letting the engine braking slow it down, right before stall, I
hit the gas, big puff of blue.  OK, so I need seals.  It also smokes really
bad under hard full throttle acceleration.  This situation would point to
rings, but after performing a compression test and getting 180 psi (+/- 1
psi) in each cylinder, I am looking for answers.

Could the valve seals be the whole problem?  Could I have bad oil blow by
on the rings and still have excellent compression?

Changing the subject, I had an opportunity to drive an '83 928 last week.
Needless to say, I want one.  I realize it does not handle like our
beloved, but what a motor!!!  I was doing 70 on the freeway, hit the gas,
next thing I know I am at 120.  Now don't start flaming me, I love all
Porsche's, and hope to own many different models in my (hopefully) long
Porsche owning life.  Now if I can just get that vasectomy without my wife
knowing............

Jay
