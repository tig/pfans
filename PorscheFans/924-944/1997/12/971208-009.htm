Sure there is.  First use the key to open the trunk as it seems to often
succeed when the electric release fails.  Then there would seem to be two
ways to attack the problem:

1) Peel the carpet which covers the spare tire and look for the electric
release mechanism somewhere on the rear of the car.  I faintly remember a
cable being involved per a post on this list.  I have never seen the
mechanism, but I will guess that the cold weather or cable stretch have
conspired against you.  

2) On the hatch itself, loosen the nut which is next to the glass frame
holding the latch pins tight.  Now you should be able to turn the pin and
by turning it adjust its length.  Feel free to clean the area and
lubricate the mechanism while you are there, I have seen the pins rust on
neglected vehicles. 

I hope some of this is helpful.
