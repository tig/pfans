        Thanks to everyone for your informative responses. There are a 
few things I (you) must consider when going for the "sell the 944, buy 
951" option. 
         First off, and I've said this before, where i live, Berlin, 
Germany, although the cars (944) actually cost less then in America, a 
used 944 is typically owned by a "sub-human" drunk that can barely 
differentiate between water and oil. This speaks for the state that the 
cars are in, of course you will say, "Get the an engine rebuild", but it 
isn't only the engines that are in a deplorable state, the interiors 
look like cheap brothels! Notice, that although there are far more 944s 
in Germany you do not see people from there participate, in Germany you 
do not find the "Porsche" culture as in America, of course you do with 
first time buyers, but not like in the USA where the used ones, 
particularly the 944's, are respected for what they are, and that is 
great sports cars. Ever since my 944 left the factory 
it has been in my family's hands, also in March of this year it was 
re-painted, in the original color of course (indisch Rot).
        My last objection, point, is that I intend to have the car 
shipped to Argentina, the mechanics seem to be very competent (very hard 
to find in Germany) and are relatively cheap. And while I am on that 
point I would like to officially "de-mystify" the conceptions you 
Americans seem to have about German mechanics. It is undoubtedly true 
that we do have great engineers, BUT these are to be found in the 
construction of automobiles, NOT in repair. 
        Having said all that, I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and 
Great New Year.

From BERLIN,
                                           Pat.
