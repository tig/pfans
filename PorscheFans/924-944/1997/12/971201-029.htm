 recommended by the local P Dealer and did an excellent job.

Guys,

Be real careful about this and check it out with regards to your expectations
before you do it.  Most "good" leather is analine dyed meaning that it is
dyed like fabric and then tumbled for softness (ie. the color permeates the
entire depth of the leather).  This "spray paint" method is called pigment
coating and is just that . . . . . a top coating only.  This method of
coloring leather is very susceptible to cracking and splitting when exposed
to temperature extremes due to the different coefficients of expansion of the
two materials.  Problems arise even in the temperature and humidity extremes
in the average house . . . . . not to mention the much harsher environment in
the average car!
