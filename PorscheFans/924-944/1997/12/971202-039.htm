To echo what Barry says, if they are shot repacking them will just buy
some time. BUT if they are just dry and not shot yet, repacking them may
save your butt.  

Either way if you can sling a wrench make a try at repacking them you
will need a 12 point star socket check out you vw shop, and a bunch of
grease, I use about a 1 - 1.5 pints each time.  I buy by the gal. If you
can't get CV grease by the qt. Contact me I will sell you at 10.50 a qt
+ shipping.

	Hello Bob,

	> Question(s) #1:  Does just repacking the CV joints usually
solve the
	> problem?  If so, for how long?  And given the amount of work
to remove

	Generally, no. If your CV joints are worn to the point of making
	an audible click, then they are too worn for repacking. Think of
	repacking the CV grease as a preventative measure. If your
engine
	started knocking because the bearings were worn, changing the
oil
	would not stop the knock. You should repack your CV joints
BEFORE
	they start to click.

	That said, you may be able to change the orientation of the CV
joint, 
	repack it with fresh grease, and use it for a long time. Since
the
	joints tend wear in one direction (since you usually go
forward),
	changing the orientation of the cv joint will probably allow you
to
	get a lot more miles from it. 

	> and repack, would you just replace (assuming you have the

would you
	> try to repack first?

	It all depends on how much money and/or time you have.
Obviously, the
	easiest thing to do is take it to your shop and have them
replace all
	the joints. If you have no money, but a few hours, you can
remove both
	axles, disassemble the 4 CV joints, clean them, reassemble them,
repack
	with grease and install them in the car.  That will cost about
$15 for
	grease, but will take you around 4 - 6 hours if this is your
first time
	and you're using hand tools.

	> Question #2:  Is it a big hassel to repack the CV joints?  Can
your
	> "garage mechanic" type do it to save a few bucks?  Or do you
recommend a

	It's a fairly straightforward operation. Most of the details are
	included in a FAQ. You can do this one by yourself.

	good luck,
