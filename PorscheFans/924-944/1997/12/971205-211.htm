The problem is very simple.  The listserver software has a major bug in =
it
(one of many I'm sure).  If a subscriber sends a message to a list that
he/she is subscribed to, such as 924-944, but then also CCs this message
to other lists for which he is not a member, the message gets caught in
some kind of "worm hole" whereby it just keeps regenerating more =
messages.

=46or those of us with decent enough mail software, it is a simple =
procedure
to just filter out the messages.  In my case they are marked for deletion
and I never see them, although they still need to be retrieved from the
server, and that is still a pain.  When I logged in tonight I had 332
messages waiting.  BTW, this is one of the many reasons I'm not on the
digest.  Who wants 100s of copies of a message filling up their file?  =
Not
me.
