Hello Fans,

Found something interesting concerning motor oil.  I
use Valvoline multi-grade and while searching on the
web for info on VALVOLINE motor oils, I stumbled
upon Nord Sterns home page and found an article
titled "Valvoline Synthetic 5W-30 Wins Porsche
Recommendation".  According to the article, Porsche
is going to place their recommendation in their 1993
owners manuals.

Unless there is a typo in the articles date, this is old
news which makes me wonder why most list
members use Mobil 1 synthetic.  Is the article not
accurate?

 It's a pretty interesting article.  It can be found at

  http://www.nordstern.org/PCA_Articles/

I don't use a synthetic now, but I'm considering it. 
Since I change my oil religiously every 3K miles I felt
that the type of oil used is not all that important,
therefore,  I really didn't pay attention to the lists
recommendations to use synthetics.  But now I'm
beginning to think otherwise.  The thought of going
synthetic, however,  does concern me because I've
learned through this list that the oil will find its way out
but I can't remember if this is just temporary.
 
If I do, I will continue to use VALVOLINE (don't want to
switch brands at this point) but switch to the 5W-30
synthetic recommended in the article.

What do you guys/gals think? (I know, I know, we
went through this once, but what the heck - I'll pay
attention this time)

In a message dated 97-12-16 11:10:08 EST, you write:

<< Find someplace that sells sockets that use a better bonding process.  A
rule I
 usually use is that if the bit wiggles in the socket, then pass.

You're probably right from a quality standpoint, but here's a counter point.


A few months ago I needed to get some real serious torque on an 8mm 
hex head, and there was (as usual) not enough space to use the ratchet
with the hex/socket.  The regular hex wrench was bending and I was afraid
it might strip. Since I have the craftsman ones, I was able to slide 
the small hex bit out of the socket, put it in the bolt, and put a wrench on
it.

It worked!  So as they say, you just never know... and you can never have 
too many tools.

From a member of the silent majority...

I look forward to reading the digest at work every morning with my coffee... I
actually look forward to coming to work to see what's new each morning.  My
co-workers wonder what I'm doing as a chuckle out loud when reading the posts.
Thanks to you more active members for your knowledge and humor.

To J. Tolbert who did not leave an e-mail address...

The security key on my 86 951 uses the same key blank as the ignition/door,
and you can buy the blank from Automotion or the dealer for about $8.  A
locksmith may have to do the rest.

To the tire experts...

What's a good all season tire for an occaissional drive through the snow...
not a daily driver?
