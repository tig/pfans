I guess normally one would think this. I bought my 84 with 84k (unverified)
miles. Not extremely low but according to the PO the car was not driven
much in recent years. I recently switched to synthetic. I was very hesitant
not wanting it to leak like a seive but always after a little adventure I
went against good judgement. I'm pleased to say it hasn't developed a
single leak and oil consumption is much lower. Was using a qt every 800 mi
with straight 50W now a qt every 3000 mi. on 15W50 Mobil 1!    

Otherwise I agree with your comments. I did develop a rear main seal leak
that had to be repaired shortly after putting the car in full service.
Fortunately that has been the only leak.

Disclaimer:  I'm not recommending switching to synthetic, only a personal
anecdote. Switch at your own risk.
