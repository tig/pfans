I'm still looking for input (supportive or technical) on my head gasket
replacement ('77 924)! Are there any pitfalls to be avoided? Any words
of advice at all??? I'm concerned by the fact that I have to interpolate
from the stupid (Haynes) manual which only lists a procedure for R+R of
the head with the engine already out!

Valves: I have to replace the valve stem seals in the process: I plan to
rent/borrow a standard off-head valve spring compressor to aid in this.
Will it be necessary to use an adaptor like a cylindrical sleeve to gain
sufficient compression due to the OHC design enclosing the spring
completely? I have experienced this need in the past (on a TR7 head).

I need to hear any answers as soon as possible, since I have to do this
this weekend, and can prepare until then (including any adapters that
may need to be manufactured), but then I'm offline and away from any
supply sources...

Please advise...

TIA
