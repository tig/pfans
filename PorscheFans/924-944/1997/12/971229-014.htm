The windshield antenna system includes a preamplifier.  It
a small black box which says 'FUBA' on it.  It is located under
the dash on the passenger's side, on the opposite side of
the firewall from the battery.

The coax leading from the preamp to the radio has an extra
wire routed along side it in a common piece of tubing.  This
wire must be connected to the 'power antenna' lead of your
radio.  This so that the preamp is only operational when the
radio is powered on.

If you do not connect power to the preamp, the two main
symptoms are:

	- Only very strong FM stations can be received,
	- No AM stations can be received

Actually you can receive AM stations - if you are within a
mile or so of the transmitter site.

(I'm still looking for a schematic diagram for the FUBA
preamps.  So far all my efforts have been fruitless.  So I've
resorted to buying a spare from Parts Heaven and making
my own.)
