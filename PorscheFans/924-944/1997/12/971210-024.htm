Steve --

Lessee -- the stock 2.7 was 165 hp (?) at the flywheel and you're talking
about 210 hp at the same.  Which is the same as the stock S2.  Not bad! 
Porsche didn't do that well on relative hp on early US and Euro spec cars,
which had about a 1.5 point difference.  If I recall correctly, stock
compression on the 2.7 liter was 10.9:1.  How much higher did you bump it,
and how did you do it? Decking a couple of mm would get it around 13 (?),
and the valves must have gotten fairly close to the pistons.  What octane
did you have to use? And the airflow sensor --  replaced with a hot-wire
sensor? Sounds interesting.  Can't recall if that model had knock sensors.
How long did the engine last?
