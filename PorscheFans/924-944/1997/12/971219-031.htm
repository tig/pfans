Happy Holidays PorscheFans:

I've got an idea I want to run by everyone...

Starting Thursday, August 13, 1998 thru Sunday the 16th our favorite Marquee
will be the guest of honor at the world's premier car event, Pebble Beach
Concours and Laguna Seca Vintage Sports Car Race. Most of you are probably
already familiar with this fact and perhaps even the details surrounding the
event as well. As I understand, Porsche is emptying their Zuffenhausen
museum to make this the biggest on-track display of Porsche's ever
assembled.

For the last year I've been planning to fulfill my life long ambition to go
to the Concours and Race by driving cross-country in my 951 to attend this
event. I have also heard a few others on the digest talk about going as
well. So I was wondering:

Would you be interested in a PORSCHEFANS 924/944/968 MEET at this event?

If so, drop me an E-mail and let me know what you think.

Maybe we could get a block of rooms at the same hotel; dinner/banquet; our
own "show" (no tooth brushes allowed!); take over a local brewery for an
evening or all of the above. If there's interest, I'll keep everyone posted.
