As always on the Porsche list, people think that German engineers are gods
and that they don't have to abide by any rules of governments, safety
boards or any "limiting" factor that other engineers are subjected to.

No, I don't have any experience with these.  But, any car that is optimised
to run on average consumer fuel will see a gain from getting a re-mapped
chip designed for high octane fuel (US 92 octane or higher).  This is very
basic engine technology, advanced timing with higher octane fuel gives
better throttle response and higher HP, *BUT* and this is the BIG *BUT*,
how much can you get out of this additional amount?  Now that we've
dispelled the fact that Porsche engineers are Gods, let me be clear that
I think they are a cut above regular humans :)  They do manage to eek almost
everything out of the NA engines using knock sensors and sophisticated
computers.  But, I still feel there are gains to be had with a tuned
package that includes, air intake, chip upgrade, exhaust and perhaps no
cat-con.  The gains for the above mods would be in the range of 5% increase
in air flow (let's assume; Steve, have any opinions?), so let's say that
the 5% increase in air flow relates directly to 5% increase in HP.  So, if
the S2 comes with 208hp, adding 5% would equal around 10hp.

So, for the cost of an exhaust, air intake and chips, is 10hp going to be
enough to feel?  I doubt it.  The chips may give a better throttle response
by modifying the fuel maps and throttle-decay curves, but that does not
give you any power, just feel.  Is 10hp enough to pass someone down the
straight at the local track?  I doubt it.

People can ramble all day long like I did above about what power you'll get
based on assumptions, opinions and personal experience.  I really don't know
NA cars, and everyone has opinions, so to seperate the bunk from the reality,
why not get a set of refundable chips, stick the car on a dyno, run a few
baseline figures, pop the chips in and see what happens?  With all the money
that flows across this list, it always stuns me that people are so scared
to test something!

People can doubt your opinions, they can doubt your attitude, they can
even doubt your knowledge, but NO ONE can doubt your objective numbers
splattered all over the dyno sheets.

One more side note, most people who stick their cars on the dyno find other
problems with the car like clogged fuel filter, clogged air filter, etc, etc.
So, getting the dyno time might give you 10-15hp without spending money on
a chip!  Tim Stark's 944T went from 236hp at the wheels to 250hp at the wheels
after we dumped about 5 lbs of dirt out of his air filter!  14hp for a few
shakes of the wrist whacking the filter on the ground.

Just be careful when giving out your information, there are wolves among us.
