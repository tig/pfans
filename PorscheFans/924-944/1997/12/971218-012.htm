     For everyone who has not been following this discussion since its
beginning - Tom and I have already had the age/mileage discussion in great
detail. The original recommendation I gave Tom, which some of you must have
obviously missed,  was 3 years or 30,000 miles.   Our original discussion
(Tom Pultz and I) was about the mileage recommendation given by Porsche and
the age. The 30,000 miles which I originally gave Tom was based on
discussions with Porsche Cars North America. However, that mileage was
changed by service bulletins and never changed in the original maintenance
guides for the earlier model cars. I was trying to explain to Tom and
others that I believed my original "mileage"  recommendation was incorrect.
The 3 years was based on personal experience and recommendations from
several shops I had dealt with. Porsche has never had an age recommendation
for replacing the belts. However, they do realize that people don't drive
their cars as much as Porsche intended them to be driven. That's why
Porsche recommends a full inspection at the two year point (including
timing belts)  and every year after that regardless of the mileage on the
vehicle. I had already pointed this out in a previous e-mail.  To clarify
my own position on timing belt replacement:

1.  Replace the timing belts every 45,000 miles on cars without hydraulic
tensioners as a minimum.  On cars with hydraulic tensioners, replace the
timing belts every 60,000 miles as a minimum.

2.  On cars without hydraulic tensioners,  the belts must be checked and
retensioned at 1800 miles.

3.  The belts on all the cars must be inspected every 15,000 miles and, if
needed, replaced. This is a factory recommendation for all cars.  If you
choose to ignore that recommendation and do not have the inspections
performed, Porsche will not warranty any damage as a result of timing belt
failure. If you do your own maintenance, it only makes sense to follow the
same guidelines.  I've never done a timing belt on a 968 so I don't know
how difficult this is.  However, you should be able to roll the engine over
by hand (1/2 " ratchet on the crank pulley bolt) a little at a time until
all the entire belt is inspected.  I know that the inspection is not that
difficult on the 944s or the 924s.

4.  I personally recommend inspecting the belts after two years if 15,000
miles has not been reached and every year thereafter.  Replace them if
necessary. I still believe replacing the belts at the 3 year point if
45,000 miles is not reached is a good rule of thumb but, I'm sure that some
people will say this is excessive.

Regardless of what any of us thinks the interval should be, no one will
argue that the timing belts on these cars is the weak link in an otherwise
great automobile. The bottom line is that every owner has to weight the
costs of inspecting and replacing the belts against the potential cost of
replacing most of their valve train. The shop at which I used to work  is
currently working on a 16 valve 944 that experienced a timing belt failure.
By the time the bill is totaled, the owner is going to have at least $2000
in parts alone (and at least $1000 in labor).  The failure occured due to
an oil leak that contaminated the belt and caused it to fail prior to
45,000 miles. Had the belts been inspected at the 15,000 mile intervals as
required by Porsche (which they weren't),  this could have been prevented.
We , as owners, have to decide for ourselves at what intervals we are going
to take the necessary steps to prevent that from happening to us.  The
recommendations above are just that - recommendations.  They are based on
Porsche's guidance and my own experience.

Good Luck
Clark Fletcher
