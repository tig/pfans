Hi P-Fans,
 I'm still working on getting my suspension upgrades finished on my 85.5  NA
.. At this point I'm waiting for another list-member to finish his upgrades so
I can have the stock sway bars of his turbo. One man's trash is another man's
treasures! When this is done I would like to maybe do/(have done? )a little
headwork .
 In the Dec. 1997 Excellence "Tech Forum" Jim Pasha states  "The cylinder
head is the first "internal" component of the engine that requires work.
Improving the air-flow characteristics of the 951 (and all 944/968 heads)
will yield one of the biggest horsepower gains.) One of the noted problems
with 944 two-valve cylinder heads is the shape of the exhaust port. If the
area next to the valve has the wrong shape, a lot of airflow is restricted.
Proper reshaping will greatly improve airflow."
  Who does this headwork? How much material gets removed from where? Will a
light polishing do any good? 
My  car is a euro-spec, grey market car with the higher compression. Would a
little milling/grinding of the head and/or block generate any more
safe/noticable horse-power or would I just be setting myself up for
deteniation problems.?
TIA
