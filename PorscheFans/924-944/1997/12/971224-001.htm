Merry Christmas,
This year in sunny Edmonton Alberta we have not seen the temperature dip
below minus 10 C yet.  It has been so mild that we locals intend to keep
this "El Nino" character here forever if we find him.  However, last
December I remember attending a truly memorable tech session called
"Beltfest" which I subsequently wrote about and which I am including here
to show you Floridians how much fun we have in the cold white north.

BELTFEST 96
On Saturday December 28, 1996, I decided to take a Cold Survival Training
course offered by the Rennsport Registry called "Beltfest 96", it involved
watching "Max" an aging 83 944 have it's belts and seals replaced in a
(heated?) barn in minus 41 degree Celcius weather.   Oh, the temperature
inside the barn was a balmy minus ten up to the knees and an even balmier
minus one at about chest height.  Officially verified by a certified
Rennsport bulb thermometer nailed to the wall.  

The day started off, with me meeting Scott in the parking lot of the
northernmost grocery store in the city, so that I and any other brave and
committed club members (who managed to keep their batteries unfrozen and
got their cars started that morning) could follow him to the designated
secret training facility where this "Beltfest" was to take place. This was
a strategic precautionary measure by Scott, because he only wanted the most
hardy members to attend (natural selection and all that) hence, he only
provided instructions to get you as far as the store - you could then get
to the secret site by following him from there on snow packed rural roads.
It was so cold that you could only see a thick white cloud of exhaust from
the car ahead of you and you hoped that when you reached that part of the
cloud, the car ahead was no longer occupying the same space as you.  Once
there, having been blinded by thick ice forming on the inside of your
windshield and disoriented by the extreme cold from scraping said
windshield while attempting to breathe conservationaly to stop ice forming
on said windshield, there was no turning back.  To risk getting lost in
those temperatures would have been even more fun, since Scott would simply
have have left instructions for you on the finer points of condensed cold
weather orienteering.  

The only other brave, or brain (or is it DME) dead, soul to show up was
"Max," (the celebrated and well known to Rennsport members, metallic red
Porsche 83 944) driven by it's faithful owner/driver Simon.  Max was there
to have his (her) belts and seals changed and since Max was in serious
terminal belt pain, according to Simon, we made our way to the facility as
if we were taking a seriously ill patient to the hospital emergency room,
without complaint and with the requisite deference and smugness reserved
for such self serving moral acts of kindness.  By the way, I never did
determine Max's true gender since I was too cold to crawl under to check
Max out and in the end I forgot to ask Simon.

The training facility was hand picked by Scott for the degree of challenge
it offered.  Since a normal belt and seal change in more civilized (warm)
garage like conditions would not have sufficiently tested our mettle in his
opinion.  After all this is the Rennsport Registry and not some wimpy
(insert Florida) Porsche club.  Besides tools are much less likely to slip
out of your hands if they are frozen to your skin.   Also, being an
Edmontonian Canadian (as opposed to a Calgarian) requires that you are
capable of exercising your full motor (or is that motoring) functions in
any weather. This is the e-X-treme  version of the popular North American
pastime of shade tree wrenching.  As a bonus there is virtually no mess to
clean up afterwards, because oil just becomes jello and you simply pick it
up and wiggle it into the garbage bag.

But I digress, the secret facility was not insulated, had big barn swing
doors with two foot gaps, ostensibly to keep us fed with good clean healthy
outside air and only lacked a manger and appropriate farm animals to tie us
into seasonal character.  

Simon and Scott wrenched away at Max for about 10 hours (yes! ten hours)
while I watched in a cold induced coma clutching a camcorder.  If there are
any Sony Techs on the list - "Camcorders do not work at minus ten, I repeat
Camcorders do not......."  When I couldn't feel my feet any more, I found a
tiny piece of acoustic ceiling material and proceeded to use this 4"X10"
chunk of building scrap like an island on which to stand.  I kept warm by
imagining that there were warm beaches and palm trees growing on this
ceiling tile island.  I had read that this mind imagery worked from a
passage in a Shirley Maclaine book I had once borrowed from the library.
This was when I was in my Eastern/Zen non-materialistic phase of my life,
however, my first Porsche repair bill quickly cured me of that malady. If
you have ever played "statue" for ten straight hours in a sub zero meat
freezer, would you begin to appreciate the kind of fun one can have with
just the use of a few functioning brain cells. 

This was for me, a seminal experience and I came away from it, a changed
man (or was that because I had to take a leak outside in minus forty one?)
since I now possess the secret knowledge of the wise Porsche sages - I too
have witnessed with mine own eyes ( albeit, peering from a frozen body) the
heretofor  secret ceremony of "Beltfest" or the "changing of the belts"
complete with the proper use of the special ceremonial tensioner tool.  I
am now an "initiate" and when belts are mentioned and a hush falls in the
room because of the soft painful sound of your wallet leaving your person,
like your soul does at death, I am told. I no longer fear the unknown and
can relax, reminisce and bask in the warm afterglow of frostbite.
