Hey,

OK, I guess my updated "sig" got a little ahead of my writing, so I
thought I'd better make it official.  I am now a PORSCHE owner as of this
past Monday, December 8.

Details:

She/he/it (take your pick, I haven't decided yet) is a 1990 944 S2 Coupe
in Guards Red (what else), with Black partial leather and no other =
factory
options.

Overall condition is just shy of perfection and the odometer currently
reads 30,665.  I am the 3rd owner.  The car was originally sold in Texas
and came to Washington State  in March, '94.  Being a Texas car, the
original owner had the side and rear windows professionally tinted, and
while they do take a bit of getting used to, especially while driving at
night, I like the look and it should help in the summer.

The 2nd owner added a few items such as Porsche floor mats, Porsche crest
wheel caps, and Hella H4 headlights.  No biggies for sure, but nice to
have anyway.  My contribution so far (many more to come) has been the
installation of a Sony CDX-C760 CD unit.  Great unit, but the stock
speakers leave a lot to be desired.  Sounds like a future speaker/amp
upgrade here...

As you all know, I was really hoping to find an '89 944 Turbo, so I
thought I would be a bit disappointed with the S2.  Surprise.  I'm not.  =
I
love this car!  While it could use an extra 80-100 HP to move it into the
pure excitement category, the low rpm flexibility and torque *really* are
nice to have around town.

Compared to the M030 Sport Suspension on my son Scott's turbo, this car
takes slow speed bumps better, but out on the highway, it actually seems
rougher (on tar strips), probably due to its SP8000 tires vs my son's =
nice
riding S-02s. =20

The last couple of days have been a bit damp, so I haven't even driven it
hard yet, but one thing I immediately noticed, it really, really needs a
LSD (all 944 due).  On anything but clear dry pavement, the right rear
spins with ease.  My son's turbo just digs in and goes.  Could there be a
Quaife in the future?  I hope so, along with 17" wheels and tires,
suspension upgrades, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Porsche, there is no substitute.
