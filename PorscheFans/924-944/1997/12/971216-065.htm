Hi,

I've decided not engage in a game of Russian Roulette.  Therefore, I'm
taking my newly purchased 30,905 mile S2 to my local (Bellevue, WA)
independent PCar shop for new cam and balance belts on Thursday.  Eight
years on the originals is enough.

My question is this.  Do most of you (have to) pay list price for parts
installed by your independent shop?  I have a feeling that I'm going to =
be
expected to pay full price for parts.  I object to this because I could =
go
a mile up the street and get them at my local Porsche dealer at a minimum
of 15% off.  I could also get the service done there, but I've had good
luck with the independent shop regarding work they've previously done on
my son's '89 turbo, so for the time being I'd like to stick with them.

I know they would frown on me just bringing in the parts, and I don't =
want
to do that because I realize they do count on some profit from the parts,
but I don't want to pay more than necessary either since I may also be
replacing some expensive rollers and tensioners.

Any thoughts?=20
