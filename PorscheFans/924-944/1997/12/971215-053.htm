Sorry for this post since I know it must appear a lot, however, I need some
advice on buying a 968 for my wife.  I know absolutely nothing about the 968
(my knowledge on Porsche's is limited to the 911), so I need to know what
model years the 968 were produced in, any problem area's with the car and
particular model years, and any other information that my be of help.  My
wife would like to have a convertible if possible, but will be more than
happy with a coupe.  Thank you for your help.

To the 924/944 and 928 Lists:

I have copied this note from the Racing List.  Thanks to Hank Watts for
composing the notice.  For those of you whom may not know Hank, he has written
two books about cars.  One of them is called Secrets of Solo Racing, which is
all about AX and solo track event driving.  Great book-- makes an excellent
gift.

Anyway, I have attended the School described below, and for the last two years
served as an instructor.  Last year at the school, I had a student with a 993
turbo, which he let me drive!!!  This event always gets full almost
immediately (i.e, within a few weeks, if not days, after registration opens),
so keep in touch with  the Co-chairperson noted below.  Although both Masuo
and Jeff are 911 drivers, they are great guys, and tremendous drivers.

At the school, we sometimes have some ex-pro and semi-pro racers helping to
instruct, along with the usual group of outstanding men and women from around
the area.  You'll get a lot of seat time for you money, and the environment is
safe and friendly.  Last year, we had some students who traveled quite a
distance to join us, and I believe that they found the experience extremely
worthwhile.

This School is a Porsche Club of America Zone 7 event, but anyone is welcomed
to sign up an attend, as long as they are driving a Porsche.

If you are interested, sign up immediately upon the opening of registration,
or else you may not make it in.  I will post a notice when official
registration opens early next year.

>The dates have been set for the 1998 Zone 7 Beginner and Intermediate

>exercises (skidpad, braking, decreasing-radius, linked turns, slalom, etc.)
>then features two autocross courses on Sunday.  Enrollment is limited
>to 90 students and it will fill up very fast once the notices hit the Zone
>7 regional newsletters in either the Jan or Feb issues.  There will be
>about 60 instructors, so the student-instructor ratio is very good.

>I can absolutely recommend this weekend as one of the best ways to

>Cost is $90.
