This sounds just like what my son's car is now doing.  One day it has =
full
boost and the next only 1.2 bar (fail safe mode).  I jiggled the
electrical connections to the cycling valve and that helped for a day, =
but
I suspect maybe there is some corrosion or other problem as yet
undiagnosed.

The idle is also fluctuating, but not up to the 1800 of your car.  His is
more like between 500 and 900.  It just won't idle smoothly.  Could be =
the
TPS.  He plans to have it checked out early next week and I'll report =
back
what we find.  I may just replace the TPS and see if that helps =
(depending
how cheap they are).  I also ordered some Wurth contact cleaner from our
Porsche dealer, so I will try that first.

In a message dated 97-12-10 10:25:58 EST, you write:

<< I do know my front struts are shot, and I have to replace them (125 kmi).
 Would that get rid of the clunk and slop? Would replacing the strut
 turnstyles do it? Any recommendations where to source replacement
 turnstyles? I can't seem to find many sources... >>

Vaughan,

Not sure if they could be causing clunking, but the play in the wheel might be
from the strut.  When you say "turnstyles" you mean the upper strut mount,
right?  There are a couple of options here: Factory ($?), Camberball ($190 I
think), and camberplate type setups.
