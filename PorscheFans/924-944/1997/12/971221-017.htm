Hi

I had similar questions when I first bought my S2, especially since it was
broken into the first night I got it !!  Either the factory alarm or the
fact that they broke the steering wheel stopped them driving the car away
- not sure which.

I've had conflicting opinions - some say the factory alarm is hopeless,
others that it's as good as anything on the market.  Also that integrating
an after market alarm is easy or a nightmare depending on who you listen
to.

Rather than trust my car to someone who may not know what they are doing
(and thereby stuffing it up altogether), I've had a simple kill switch
fitted, and use this, the factory alarm and an OEM steering lock (in a way
in which the lock can't be pulled with a slide hammer) in my attempts to
stop the little bastards getting at it.

I'd be interested in any other responses you get......IanS
