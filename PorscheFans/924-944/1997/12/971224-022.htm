I've auto-xed and streeted on 255/50x16 and 245/45x16 BFG R1' on the
rears. You should have no rubbing problems with Stock 9" wheels. There
wasn't a big performance difference. If i had to choose I'd stick with the
245'. The 255' do fill the rear wheelwells and look cool, but does hike
the rear end up 3/4" (you could lower the rear ride height). THey should
last slightly longer because of the bigger diameter and more rubber. If
you can get a much better price, I'd say go for it. All IMHO.

Actually the most bang for the buck you can get and the easiest installation
is to replace the 944's horns with a used set out of a 911. The 911 horns are
pretty distinctive albeit not as loud as some aftermarket numbers. They also
plug right in with no mods. A little hard to find room for them but I'm sure
you can do it since I did it once.
