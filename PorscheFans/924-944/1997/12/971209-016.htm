Bill, Nick was UNDERESTIMATING the chip HP gain. It's really closer to
about 150 HP, but Dinan doesn't want to misrepresent the chip HP
gain. Some cars will even get 200 more HP! That's right, some cars
have been dynoed at over 400HP just from the HP and O2 sensor lead
change! If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes, I would not have
believed it!

You would think so, but Porsche has made the tuners agree NOT to modify
the S2. If Porsche finds an aftermarket tuner doing the 400 HP mod
to an S2, they revoke the license of that shop. This is done to protect
the people that spent 100K for the 400 HP 911 turbo. Porsche pays
$1000 a year to every shop that agrees NOT to modify the S2.

Of course! You read it, it must be true!
