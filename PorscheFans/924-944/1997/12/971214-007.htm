BS, BS and more BS. A new clutch should not vibrate or make sounds. 
I consider myself an expert on the subject, having doen two clutch 
replacement jobs in the last 6 months (924S and 944 2.7). And a
new clutch (if the job is done right) should do its job perfectly. 
Questions are: was the ride collar for the throwout bearing replaced?
If the rubber center has disintegrated have all pieces been removed
from the pressure plate? (Unless a new pressure plate was installed).

Good luck,

Paul
