Henrik -- 

Couldn't figure out your address, so I'm posting on the list.  On the
serious side, I'm expecting a FAX from Germany about the "special edition"
S2 w/ a rumored 228 hp -- or if you're out here, Guenter, maybe you could
quote relevant passages.  Beyond that, the estimate I've gotten about about
the Dinan (=Autothority?) chip is a 17 hp increase.  I think some S2 PFans
have been happy with this chip. I haven't tried it.
Beyond that, I'm still trying to figure out how to convert my S2 to a 968
and get the Powerhaus 968 goodies that bump power to 270 hp (although I'm
inclined to let that one die on the vine).  If you'd like to try knocking
out the cat and adding a B&B or Powerhaus cat-back (or a straight pipe for
the cat-back - which is best according to Windward, but not according to
Jim Pasha), I'd love to know the results.  I've removed the front half of
the air filter box to free up the intake, and it MIGHT make a small
difference in acceleration up to 115 mph.  

Other possibilities for increasing air flow through the engine include a
larger hot-wire air flow sensor and more radical cams, but I don't know
anyone who's done this - not even an S2 Firehawk racer in my PCA region.

I too would like to meet an S2 owner who has increased power by 40-50 hp
w/out forced induction, and still has a streetable car.
