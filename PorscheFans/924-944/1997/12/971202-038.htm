Given the relatively low mileage, if you don't have torn boots and grease
all under the car from the joints a re-pack should quiet them down. However,
you should probably be prepared to opt for the new joints if you find them
worn (adequate description of "worn" in the Haynes book) upon disassembly.

FWIW, if you selectively remove the rear seat belt anchor bolts you can
get a really good earfull of CV joint noise.

It is not a big hassle, but it is a greasy job. A few pair of disposable
latex gloves will help make the job a little cleaner. Just take your time,
get everything really clean, including the bolt holes in the mating flanges
and you shouldn't have any problems.

Depending upon the type of boot clamps you get with your boot/grease kit
(Zims had them cheap) you might want to invest in a "CV boot clamp" tool to
put them back on, but it is possible to improvise.

Consult the FAQ and the Haynes book and have an afternoon of it!
