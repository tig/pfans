Adam,

You can significantly improve your air filtration performance by going 
back the stock air filter.  You get much better engine protection at no 
noticeable loss in power (at least I found no detectable difference in my 
Turbo between the K&N and stock).

I always apply the following equation for performance.  Note, this 
equation is street oriented.

Fun = Performance / Money

In other words, the best bang for the buck.  Try these.

Autothority Throttle Cam = ~$35. (no performance gain, but makes the car 
a blast to drive).
16" wheels (same as Turbo).
Sticky 205 X 55 and 225 X 50 tires (wider tires and wheels are available 
at higher costs and some wet weather penalties).
Driver Education Event (PCA events are great).
