Tom,
   I recently replaced my oil pressure sending unit. However, it was
obvious that mine was failing as it was leaking a small amount of oil from
the sending unit housing. Not all of the ones that fail necessarily leak
before they fail. Also, it's sometimes hard to tell if its the sending unit
leaking or just some oil that escaped the rags during an oil filter change.
Anyway, I had noticed that over a period of time the oil pressure never got
below about 4 bar (I remembered it getting to about 2.5 bar at a Driver's
Ed several years earlier). Sometimes I would notice the oil pressure
fluctuating (about 0.5 bar fluctuations) and then settle out at around 4
bar. When I replaced the sending unit recently, I noticed that the oil
pressure started out slightly above 4 bar at idle when the engine was cold.
As the engine warmed, the oil pressure dropped to around 2.5 bar at normal
operating temperature (NOT). I use the same oil as your son in my '86 951
(Mobil 1 15W50). I remembered seeing the thread you are talking about but,
I didn't remember the values. I went back and looked at the Kevin Gross'
944 FAQ on the "The Net's 944 Corner"
(http://www.mindspring.com/~ccumming/944corner.htm). According to the 944
FAQ, the oil pressure will be about 5 bar at idle and between 2 and 3 bar
when the oil is warm (no oil type specified). It also says that it takes
your oil about twice as long to reach  NOT as it does the coolant.
Additionally, it says that if the sender fails, the oil pressure will
typically peg at 5 bar as soon as you turn the key to the on position. If
it is your sending unit, and you decide to replace it yourself, here's a
couple of tips that may help. Getting at the sending unit is the hardest
part. I disconnected the power steering pump (leaving all the lines
attached) and hung it out of the way. The easiest way to do this is to
simply remove the turnbuckle for tensioning the pump belt and then the bolt
which mount the pump to the bracket. If you remove the turnbuckle without
changing the tension, you can simply reinstall it and not have to retension
the belt. Once the pump is out of the way, there are two wires on the
sending unit. Normally, one is a spaded connector and the other is a post
connector. I believe the nut on the post is either a 7mm or 8mm. The
sending unit itself requires a 15/16" wrench to remove (Don't ask me which
metric size, I've always used a 15/16"). One thing to watch out for is that
sometimes the new sending units will come with spaded connectors on both
posts. The spades are held on by the same size nuts (7mm/8mm). If this is
the case, simply look at the old sending unit to find out which spaded
connector should be removed. The sending unit is flat on one side so its
fairly easy to get the connections right. If you do happen to get them
wrong, when you start the car, the oil pressure will be pegged high, and
the low oil pressure light may flicker at idle.

Hope this helps,
Clark Fletcher
