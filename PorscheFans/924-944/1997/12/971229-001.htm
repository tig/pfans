A few months ago Dr. Steve Timmins posted a list of wheel weights. Very
informative and gives you a good idea just how much weight you would be
adding by fitting aftermarket wheels. If I remember the Borbet C2
replica wheels were very heavy. Unfortunately the three month mail purge
here at work has made the post disappear. If the good doctor is at home
and not in convoy with one of his many Porsches then I'm sure he'd
repost.

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about who makes the best after
market 17" wheels  for this car and what company has the best prices.  I
realize the factory wheels are very high quality and would like a wheel
of at least as good quality.  Thanks, R. Morton.
