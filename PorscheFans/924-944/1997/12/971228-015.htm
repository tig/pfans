I'm parting out my '87 944S. I'm in the San Diego area. I have sold the
differential, back glass and a few other things, but most is still here. The
body is in excellent shape if some needs a shell. The car had ABS. the
interior is grey leather and in very good condition. The motor mounts have
about 2000 miles on them and are the upgrade "will never wear out" (or so they
told me) type.

I have the 7&8 x 16 flat dish alloys

I also have a 944S2 crankshaft. It was salvaged from a "good running
condition" motor that was purchased from Kempton Brothers. Unfortunately, it
ended up having a cracked block and damaged piston and head from something
metallic bouncing around in a cylinder. As far as Kempton is concerned, i was
told their response was "Hay, we're in Florida, you're in California. Sue us."
Ooops, sorry. It doesn't take much for get me going on a very sore spot. When
my 944 engine needed rebuilding a guy named Steve Kilgore at Exclusive
Motorsports in Orange County (California) suggested I buy a 944S2 engine
instead of rebuilding mine. He said it was a "bolt in" and I could install it
without a problem. He had a line on this motor (which later ended up being
Kempton). They ordered the engine and I paid, well, let's just say TOO MUCH.
(Did I mention there were several lessons I learned here?). Anyway, friends of
mine and I spend several Thursday nights installing the engine. I guess it is
a "bolt in" if you've done it before. Anyway, came the night to turn it over
and whammo. Kilgore suggested we tow it up to him (125 miles) and let him look
at it. Probably frozen lifters, he surmised. A week later the bad news was the
cracked block, etc. Kilgore's statement was "I think Kempton owes you another
engine." My statement was "I didn't buy it from Kempton, you did. I think YOU
owe me a new engine."

Anyway, many moons later I had recouped about half of my cash outlay (did I
mention that Kilgore and forgot to mention to me that in removing my original
944S head he had forgotten to remove the ONE nut from the stud that goes
through the block and is down under the back side of the enigne. Pulling off
the head cracked the back corner of the heat at the water jacket off). 

Ends up that Kilgore has a history, not only in Orange County but in San
Diego. Goes back many years. Nice guy. Knows a ton about modifying 944's for
big track stuff, but boy do you want to keep your money in your pocket around
him.......

But, back to business

If anyone is interested in parts please contact me.
