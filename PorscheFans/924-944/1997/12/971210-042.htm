Hi, Lee,

Your Turbo S wheels and tires should bolt right on...

You may have to "roll the fender" to keep the tires from=20
rubbing the rear fender lip... Your local body shop should
be able to help with this...

Good Luck!

RPM=92s. =0A=09=0A=09All this talk about increasing the boost at high RPM=
=92s got me thinking of a=0Aconversation I had with Al Colins & Lary Bers=
htien over at  AutoThority (APE)=0Aa few  years ago.  They told me that s=
ince the 944 uses a open deck design=0Aengine block (ie:  the cylinder bo=
res are unsupported by the engine block=0Acasting, the top of the bores a=
re exposed to the cylinder head ) that the=0Acylinder bores can move slig=
htly when detonation occurs or under extreme=0Acylinder pressure, ie: mor=
e than 2.0 Bar of boost. =09Al & Larry both went on to=0Asay that they fe=
lt the reason why the head gaskets failed so often on the=0A951=92s was o=
wners were running too much boost, detonation occurred, the=0Acylinder bo=
re shifted and the head gasket is the weak link and gets blown out=0Aunde=
r the pressure.  BTW - they also noted that Porsche has made several=0Aup=
dates or super cession to the 951 head gasket part, something like 13=0Ad=
ifferent super cession of the head gasket. The last such supercession was=
 in=0A1991 way after the factory stopped producing the 951!  Al Collins w=
ent on to=0Aexplain that when the onset of ignition detonation occurs, th=
e human ear=0Acannot hear in that frequency. When the detonation becomes =
severe enough, is=0Awhen the =93ping=94 becomes audible to the human ear.=
 The KLR box will recognize=0Athe engine is detonating - way before the h=
uman ear can!  =09=0A=09If you compare the stock boost level to a APE chi=
pped boost level, you will=0Afind that APE programs a lot more boost down=
 low but by about 4200 RPM=92s the=0Aboost level actually is less than th=
e stock boost map. Above 4200 RPM=92s the=0Aboost needles will roll back =
down to 1.7 Bar.  APE did this because they were=0Aconcerned about detona=
tion at high RPM=92s (ie: head gasket and engine=0Areliability). If you w=
ant to run more boost at high RPM=92s they can =93custom=0Aburn=94 a spec=
ial chip to run higher boost @high RPM=92s! These chips are what=0Amost t=
uners call a =93Cup Chip=94. Some of the Cup Chips are also calibrated fo=
r=0Aracing gas 110 Octane! The custom chips for street gas would be a che=
aper and=0Asafer way to increase performance with out defeating the KLR k=
nock sensor=0Asafety system. Do not if you run higher boost level - you w=
ill need to alter=0Athe ignition cure (custom chips or software) or the b=
asic gasoline octane (cup=0Achips)  requirement. =0A=09Since we are on th=
e subject of Boost and Octane.  Porsche said that the basic=0AUS fuel oct=
ane quality was less than the quality available in Europe. Porsche=0Ade-t=
uned their cars to run on 86 Octane pump gas in the US. In Europe, pump=
=0Agas is usually rated of 98 Octane. APE had a friendly United Airline P=
ilot=0Abring back ( on his weekly Frankfurt/Dulles flight )  a 55 gallon =
drum of=0ASuper Bliefry Gas, 98 Octane unleaded gas over there. When they=
 ran a chemical=0Atest to the best gas available here in the US, they fou=
nd out that the 98=0Aoctane German gas was equal to 94 Octane Sunnoco in =
the US!  APE ran a 911=0Aengine they had on their dyno, advanced the =93c=
hip=94 timing until the engine=0Abegan to detonate. Al Colins would drive=
 his engine builders nuts melting down=0Anew engines only a few hours aft=

 way to find detonation! Both the German and US gas=0Adetonated at the sa=

the many test AutoThority did in those pioneering days. =0A=09BTW that Un=

Tim:

The intermittent power loss under acceleration sounds like a classic fuel pump
problem.  I've experienced a similar problem on a 911.  Alternatively, a
faulty  DME relay can cause the same sort of symptoms.  I had a frind who
experienced this at the track under really hard acceleration, again in a 911,
but the systems should be roughly comparable.  Good luck!
