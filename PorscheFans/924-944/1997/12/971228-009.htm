I just went out to check out my son's old  AUDI 4000 Quattro----- it needs help !!! 
He is visiting here for vacation from UAB grad school and is heading back on Fri. He 
has to go to St. Louis on Mon., so he's taking my S2. I know my shop is closed next 
week, so he'll have to find someone " knowledgable" in Birmingham who can help keep 
it on the road for a couple more years !!!  As a "poor" student, he doesn't have 
unlimited finances, so he needs someone who has the cars "best interest" in heart... 
I know from when I used to drive it, you need a mechanic who knows what he's 
doing..When I gave him the car before he headed south, I had the car completly gone 
over by a AUDI specialty shop in IL. If anyone knows a GREAT mechanic who KNOWS 
Audis, please let me know.
