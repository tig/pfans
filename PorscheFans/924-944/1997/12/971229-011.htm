Howdy,

Hope you all had a Merry Christmas!

Now, onto business :)  I need some info from you guys, especially the
seasoned racers:

1. How do solid engine mounts affect the 944T.  In my Talon, you had to
   run a Poly engine mount if you were serious because that engine used
   to move around a lot, you could feel it oscillate over large bumps.
   I've noticed that the 944T engine is mounted much lower and further
   back and doesn't seem to have that oscillation, at least none that I
   can feel.  So, how does the solid engine mount feel, or do most people
   stick with the factory unit?  This would be for a track-only car that
   is driven on the street only to-and-from race or track events.
2. How much do things in this car weigh, specifically:
   - driver's power seat
   - passenger's power seat (probably the same as drivers I'd assume)
   - rear seat tops
   - rear seat bottoms
   - tonneau cover
   - complete A/C system including condensor and all hoses
   - all carpet
   - hood
   - doors
   - glass, front rear and side each seperate if anyone knows
3. What is a realistic weight that the 944T can be brought down to?

That's about all I can think of right now.  Don't worry, I'm not destroying
my street car, the little red beast is going to stay as a street car.  It's
still got way too low km to turn it into a dedicated track/race car.  I've
been debating the Talon vs. 944T thing for some time now.  With the Talon,
I get a brand new 400hp motor from day one for free, built by David Buschur
of Buschur Racing, but as tempting as that sounds, I hate how that car
requires so much suspension work to stop it from eating its front tires, and
as nice as 400hp sounds, the motor has a lot of weight to push/pull with the
AWD system in there.

But, the final decision maker was not so much lap times, but rather the
enjoyment of driving, the 944T is just a much more exciting car to drive
fast than the Talon on the track, both are about same for absolute lap times,
with the edge going to the Talon if the track is broken up or wet.

Now, I need to do my homework, find a good specimen and then start the
conversion.  The car would be used mostly for track events, maybe a few
PCA races at Portland and SIR (future) and a few hillclimbs.  The car
will be totally outclassed with the modifications I'm planning in PCA,
but in the other areas, it should be just right.

Farzaan.
