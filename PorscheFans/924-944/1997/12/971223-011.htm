Well, the 924 Registry is finally here, just in time for Christmas. I'll be
mailing a copy out to everyone on the Registry over the next day or two.
Just some totals, for those who might be interested:

924:             31
931:             14
924 auto.:      6

So, as you can see, there _are_ a few of us out there!

Now, for a question: I saw a comment posted a short time ago that a
wildly fluctuating oil pressure gauge could be caused by a bad sender.
Are there any other possible causes (before I go and spend $80 on a
sender)? The gauge just started acting up pretty bad, swingin' all over
the place, and it still looks too high when it stays in one place for a while.

Also, my oil pressure gauge is marked in "kp/cm^2" (77 924 US) - can
anyone confirm the units? It ranges from 0 to 10. I would gues the units
to be kiloPascals, but I thought that was supposed to be kPa, and that it's
a measure of pressure already (pressure/area = ?). Could they have
mixed the units? (1000 lbs / square cm ?) I'm confused... everyone else
is talking about either bars or psi...
