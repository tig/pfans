To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere=85),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had to=
ns
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too=85 after all, the way the police is checking now a days it'=
s
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny =96
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones eith=
er
(look mom, no hands=85 look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can g=
et
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with o=
ur
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know=85

Christopher:

Several years ago I needed Maserati valves and found that I could purchase
titanium valves at a lower cost than OEM valves.

Del West Engineering
24711 Avenue Rockafeller
Valencia, CA 91355
805-295-5700

In 1991, custom intake valves were $74 each, exhaust $84 each, minimum order
eight valves.

Del West supplies MANY racing teams, F!, NASCAR, etc.

Hope this helps, Claus

P-Fans:

I have a 1989 944S2 and would like to replace the Audi style black door handes
with a pair of 968 door handles.  My questions:  Is this a bolt-in operation?
Can I use the same lock cylinders from my S2?  Many thanks.
