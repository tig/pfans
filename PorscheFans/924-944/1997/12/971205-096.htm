To All:

There are a couple of things about the 924 doors and body you should
know about.

The 1976 to early 1980 bodys and doors will work together. The latches
and mounting are the same. At the point where the 1980.5 bodies were
introduced, the striker and latch bolt were changed to meet side-impact
regulations. The difference is easy to spot, the newer style latch is on
all bodies that have a cover over the fuel filler. Also, the latch bolt
in the body was upgraded to a 3-bolt assembly rather than the simpler
1-bolt originally used.

The later doors will physically mount into a later 944 but with the
introduction of the 944 the inner panel was changed to accomdate the
vertical speaker of the 944 stereo system.

The earlier doors had some changes in window regulators for the 1978
model year to provide for electric window and again in 1979 for the big
electric mirrors.
