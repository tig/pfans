It's not clear from your post whether you've driven a 944.  If you haven't,
try one before you make any decisions. I haven't driven the 2nd gen RX-7
Turbo, but I have driven 1st and 2nd gen NA RX7s, and the 3rd gen (wow!). 
Regarding the 2nd gen, despite the fact that it looks a lot like a 944, I
thought that the 944 handling was superior to the Mazda.  The rear
suspension on the RX7 seemed comparatively twitchy and unpredictable.  

The 951 you're looking at sounds like it's had a hard life. Better have it
checked out by a mechanic that knows these cars.

$450 for clutch parts is about right.
