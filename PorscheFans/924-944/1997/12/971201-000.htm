Hello Everybody,

Just wanted to share my feelings about the value of
this list.  I know, one thing, without it, I'd be alot poorer
both in terms of knowledge and money!!

This past holiday weekend, I came home from work
and noticed the fans running.  I normally wait to see if
they shut off, but with the holiday coming, I had other
things on my mind.  Well, that night, I had to get
something from the car and noticed no interior lights
or clock and I could hear the faint sound of fans
running.

Normally, I would have panicked, but because of the
education that I got (and continually to get) from this
list, I said  "probably the thermofan switch".  Calmly, I
grab the manual and looked at the wire list.  Grabbed
my digital multi meter and started measuring
resistance and found the temp switch closed (which
happens to be one of the control signals to the fan
relay).  After I was almost certain it was the temp
switch, I began to contemplate, should I fix it or give it
to my Porsche mechanic. 

After reviewing the manuals and finding the battery
was going to cost me $90 (the battery was on its way
out) I decided to do it myself.  Yes, I am no longer a
944 repair virgin.  I have to admit, I've worked on many
cars but the 944 is very intimidating.  If you make a
mistake, the fix for your mistake can be more than it
would have been if you'd let the mechanic fix the
original problem.  Anyway, followed the manual,
replaced the switch and she is good as new.

Bottom line, this list is invaluable!  I hope it continues
for many, many years!
