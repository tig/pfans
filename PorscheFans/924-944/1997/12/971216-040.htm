I am considering purchase of a 1988 944NA with nearly 120k miles.
Seller says the car is in top mechnical and optical condition, with 
very recent new clutch and timing&balance belts. Car is also upgraded 
to turbo-style motor mounts and has the improved oil cooler seals. He 
says he has all records since the original bill-of-sale. I would be 
the 3rd owner.

Here are my questions:

1) Should I be concerned about the mileage, which seems high for a 
Porsche of this vintage? Are there specific things that might go out 
at around this age/mileage, such as alternator, CV joints, starter, 
etc, i.e. should I factor in replacement costs for those into my 
purchase budget?

2) This car is actually for sale by the repair shop that has done all 
the maintenance for the last several years. (They're selling it on 
behalf of the 2nd owner). Should I be worried about a conflict of 
interest here, i.e. the people who say they have the records are also 
the ones who created them. In other words, could some of these records 
be fake; or am I being paranoid?


I will of course take the car in for a buyer's inspection, but wanted 
the group's collected wisdom on this as well.

Thanks for your help.
