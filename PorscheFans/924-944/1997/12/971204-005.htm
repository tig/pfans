When the voltage level from the alternator drops below that of the
battery, either from a defective alternator or a bad electrical
connection, the light will shine, due to the voltage difference. 

Make sure the alternator belt is properly tensioned.  Bad grounds can
cause the light to come on, as well as battery terminals with corroded
connections. 

Clean the battery ground cable at both connections, alternator ground
strap, as well as any other grounds you can spot in the engine compartment
- usually several brown wires coming together at a screw or bolt on the
car body. 

If your problem is not solved, you can drive the car to a battery shop or 
other garage and have them test the output of your alternator/battery to 
see if there is a problem there.

If you have a very large power amplifier (over 150 clean watts per 
channel output) and 100 watt fog lights, you may be simply taxing your 
alternator of its maximum capacity, and when the battery starts 
contributing power due to the power sag, the light will come on.

If in the rare instance you find your alternator is not keeping up with
your power demands, you might be able to swap in a later year alternator,
should it have a higher amperage rating.  My '89 owners manual states mine
is a 115 amp unit.  Check your owners manual for the amperage of yours. 
Perhaps the shop owners here on the list can verify if a later alternator
will fit. 

Amplifiers can be mounted in the two storage wells in the trunk, provided
there is enough ventilation for cooling.  Mine didn't fit, so I mounted it
on the trunk floor up against the back seat in the corner.  I cut little
slits in the carpet and passed screws with wide washers on the bottom
through to secure it. Should I need to remove it, there will be no damage
or holes left in the car body - and you won't worry about drilling a hole 
in the gas tank, which is right below.
