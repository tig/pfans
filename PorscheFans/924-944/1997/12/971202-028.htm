Lately I've corresponded with a number of P-Fans regarding suspension
improvements on 944/951's.  I've read a number of books and articles as well.
 A  common warning is "don't lower the suspension so much that the ball
joints are forced beyond their normal range of motion at full compression".

My questions are:

"How does one fully compress the suspension?", and 
"How does one measure the position of the ball joint at full compression?".

I'm probably missing something pretty basic, here, but I'd rather gain the
understanding in the relative safety of this cyber-environment than on the
backstretch at Mid-Ohio.  Chances are, you'd rather be sure I understand this
as well, cause I may be just ahead of you on the track. . . OK, maybe it's
because you're getting ready to lap me again, but either way, neither of us
want my control arm separating from the ball joint.

Any help?
