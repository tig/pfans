Puhleeze let us read any response you get back, although I have a feeling
that your name will quietly be dropped from their mailing list...shame. 

If they are like most companys you will probably start to get two copies of
their catalouges now !

I'm going to try this one more time as maybe most of the list is back reading
the      e-mail instead of deleting the cheeseheads messages:

 Dear P-Fans,
 
 Sorry about the re-post on this but it seems it didn't get out the first time
 .. . . . . maybe it was blocked by too many "cheeseheads"!
 
 1.  Awhile back I wrote that my passenger-side radiator fan wouldn't stop
 running and the general consensus on the list was that the thermoswitch was
 bad.  I've been getting ready to replace it but I had another thought.  If
 there is only one thermoswitch for the fans, why does the driver-side fan
 still cycle on and off normally?  Could it be a bad relay or something else?
 Or, is it really the thermoswitch?
 
 2.  All of a sudden my clutch doesn't seem to want to return as quickly as
 normal when I lift my foot off.  It still comes up but it feels like it
 hesitates slightly and the amount of effort it takes to press the pedal seems
 "light".  The clutch doesn't slip or grab at all but it seems almost too easy
 to depress the pedal and then it hesitates to return properly.  Is this
master
 cylinder, slave cylinder, or what?
 
 TIA for the help,

<<Since you've had experience with both the 944 and 911, there must be at
least one way in which the 911 shines in track driving that tops the 944. 
Or not.  Any thoughts? >>

Although I autocrossed both cars, my track driving was mostly 911.  In auto-x,
the 911 was great in tight turns because you could use all that mass to swing
the back end around.  Also, in slaloms, you could lift on turn in to bring the
tail out quite nicely.

For predictability and stability, the 944 wins hands down, at least at my
skill level (which is intermediate).  In a 911, once you commit to the line
through the turn, you'd best not try to change it, unless you enjoy travelling
backwards at high speed (I tried this: a guaranteed Immodium moment.)  The 944
will forgive errors far beyond the point at which the 911 is uncontrollable,
though it will also be happy to spin if you run out of ideas and talent at the
same time.

 My non-spoilered '88 911 was very scary on bumpy track at 135+.  It also ran
out of brakes pretty quick at Seattle International Raceway.  I now have a
944S2, which has big brakes, and am eager to see how they do.  My guess is
that I'll be quite a bit quicker in the S2 because of the increased
comfort/control level.

All that said, there is nothing quite like the sound of the 911 engine at
redline in third gear coming out of turn two at SIR, holding on for dear life
until the car settles down enough to grab fourth and shoot off down the hill
toward the hairpin at 3A. . . . 

Bottom line:  I love 'em all.
