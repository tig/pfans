Hi,

This is to let everyone know that I have managed to solve my spark plug
problem. Hopefully, by sharing my experience, you might be able to solve
similar problems you encounter in future.

My problem was a broken spark plug cable. It was hanging by its insulation
with a gap of 1cm between the severed cable and the spark plug point (next
to engine). I guess this explains the jerks because from idle to 2000rpm,
electricity could still jump across the gap of the severed cable. Between
2000rpm and 3200rpm, higher engine vibrations make the cable swing towards
and away from the plug point. This connects and disconnects the cable,
hence the jerks. After 3200rpm, the cable is completely disconnected unless
I start reducing the vibrations by slowing down.
