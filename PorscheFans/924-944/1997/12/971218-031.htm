I was in the dealer's parts department yesterday and low and behold there 
is a computer.  Further questioning confirmed that they indeed had the CD 
most of us have been waiting for.  I inquired as to how I would get one and 
was told "Dealers only and we have to pay $7000 a month for it".  A quick 
call to PCNA confirmed that these CDs (and apparently the PC running the 
software) are being leased to Porsche Dealers and the CDs themselves are 
not available to the public.  There is no plan today to make them 
available.  Hmmm...sounds like a call from every list member to PCNA may be 
in order.  Their number is 800-767-7243.

A non techie said at PCNA (Pia) that you have to have the whole system but 
the PC I saw was a standard pentium desktop.  I doubt that PCNA would use a 
system that required a hardware encryption card and most people who would 
be subcontracted to build a CD like this for a company would make it self 
contained (any proprietary code would be contained on the CD); so I doubt 
this is any more than a smoke screen.

I am not done with the idea of taking my thinkpad up there and "checking it 
out".  I will keep you posted.

Mark
