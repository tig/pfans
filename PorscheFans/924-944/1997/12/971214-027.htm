Daniel: my '84 944 came with the "Sport" package which appears to be the
early version of M030. This included the following non-standard options:
- 7J(front) and 8J(rear) forged alloys instead of the standard 7J cast
alloy cookie cutters
- Limited Slip Diff.
- 4-spoke 14" leather wheel
- Bigger front sway-bars
- Rear sway-bars
- Bilsteins front and rear
- 250lb springs

Last week I had the shift linkage replaed on my 87 944s. I had the linkage
come loose several times over the last few months, so I just bit the bullet
and bought the new parts. Interesting enough, Porsche had changed the design
slightly stateing that the bolt originally used was too short and prone to
loosening. GOOD CALL !!!
Now that I ahve had that replaced, (very simple work actually), I have noticed
a change in the sound that my clutch makes. I dont see how this can be
related, but I did not notice this noise untill this week. When I am in
neutral, I can hear a faint humming of grinding sound from the clutch area.
When I depress the clutch and put the car in gear(even when not moving) the
sound goes away. What does this sound liek too all of you much more educated
P-Fans? I had the clutch replaced less than 3000 miles ago.
There is also a slight problem with the gear shift lever wanting to jump out
of third gear. When in third, if I even slightly let off the gas, it jumps
into neutral. Thsi is also only since the new linkage was put in. In fifth, I
can feel the lever move to the rear slightly, but not all the way into
neutral.
