Marv,

:)  That's funny.  I think I would choose another Porsche over an
additional girlfriend as well.  Not only are the Porsche's cheaper in
the long run, but it's like the old joke says:

Little boy and little girl are playing one day.  Little boy looks down
and says "I have one of these and you don't"  Little girl says, "Yeah,
well with one of these I can get all of those that I want"

Kinda makes sense to me.  It is sort of sick how many more 'adorables'
take notice and smile at you when your car has the P-word on the back. 
"Yeah, well with one of these I can get all of those that I want"  :) 
hehehe.
