By looking at your email address Dave, I'm come to the conclusion that you
live around here.

Where did you find a 944T in Vancouver for C$8500?  Especially an 88???
The cheapest ones I've seen right now are:

1987 for $16,900  65,000mi
1989 for $31,000  12,000km
1987 for $13,500 120,000km
1989 for $19,500 120,000km (frame damage)
1989 for $18,250 115,000km (friend sale)

We've been looking for a late 944T for Mark, Paul's younger brother so
our eyes and ears have been open, but apparently not wide enough.
