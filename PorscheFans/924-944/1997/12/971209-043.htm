Howdy,

I test drove a bone stock '86 951 w/80K miles over the weekend.  The car
was the silver (with blue hints) with cream colored interior.  The car was
in very good shape, and maintained by a very active local club member (Rich
Bontempi).  I am running the records with him right now...  :-)

Anyway, to put it lightly I was very surprised by the performance of the
car (in a bad way).  The power is nothing close to any of my cars.  I would
guess that the chip in my car does alot more than I expected.  Has anyone
else there gone from a chipped 951 to a non-chipped car?  Is the change
that much!?!?  My wild guess is that the car felt 70+hp less.  What also
surprised me is that the clutch of this car had lots of vibrations (as does
my 951).  I figured my car was the only one with the vibration (or bad
pedal feel), do all (or many) 951s feel this way?  Finally, the stock
brakes on the '86 951 are plain bad.  Maybe with hi-performance pads they
are ok (as they are in my car), but in stock form they are horrible. The
chassis is tight and solid.

All I could think after the test drive (while I was driving my E30 M3 home)
was a discussion we had several months ago discussing the 951 versus an E30
M3.  I will tell you, flat-out, my M3 would *KILL* that stock 951 is
*EVERY* way (except maybe top speed.)  Of course having a track tuned 951,
I understand what they can do, but it actually shocked me how poorly the
stock 951 performed.  I will be testing another later this week and see if
the first car was just a "bad" 951 or a "dud".

Am I just too used to my modified cars, and was this car fine?  Or am I
right in suspecting something might be wrong with this car?

Comments?

I too had the fibre drive gear strip, but refused to pay the $470+ (Canadian)
for a new one. I tried the repair - best that aerospace could offer. Epoxy
plus 24 hours in a curing oven. I stripped the teeth on the first revolution.
I was advised that it was probably made by Bosch and  could get a new
gear/shaft assembly. I spent a year on the hunt, (including a trip to the
Porsche parts department at the factory in Zuffenhausen), finally spending an
hour with the owner of a Bosch dealership in Germany! After taking my problem
as a personal challenge, he made 5 or 6 phone calls. The "bottom line" was
that the motor is NOT made by Bosch, but is likely a subcontracted item out of
Porsche, i.e. Porche own the design and control the aftermarket.No parts are
sold - only the complete motor.
I finally gave up and bought a used one (as-new condition, inside and out) for
$100 (Canadian - that's about $70 US) from Randy at Whale Tail Porsche Parts,
Waterloo, Ontario. Tel: (519) 699 4911
