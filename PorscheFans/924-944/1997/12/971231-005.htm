Ian,
    The fan speed switch selects how much series resistance there is in line 
with the Blower Motor, so your switch could be bad, or most likely, the 
resistor assembly needs R&R or replacement. These high power resistors are 
located between the fuse box and blower motor under the plastic cover which 
protects the blower motor. I would check the connections, and the over temp 
switch located on the resistor assembly. If you need to replace the resistor 
assembly, a used unit is inexpensive in the US, but not sure if one could be 
obtained Down Under. If that is a problem, I am sure you could find a suitable 
replacement power resistor from an electronics supplier. If you need more 
details, or help, let me know.. Speed 1 is normally a very slow speed, barely 
audible. Speeds 2 and 3 use series resistance, and speed 4 is full speed with 
no series resistance..

Good Luck, Happy New Year!
Ezra

Hi - think I've seen something on this in the past - mine doesn't appear to
work in position 1 - 2, 3 & 4 are fine.......simple fix ?? (or could it be
that position 1 is no more than the constant slow speed running fan and
therefore you shouldn't hear/feel a difference ??)
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help, and Merry Christmas/New Year from
down under !
