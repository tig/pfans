Hello everyone,

A thanks to everyone who emailed me about hatch shocks and rear-suspension
shock alternatives to expensive Koni $ Bilstein.

I just spent 4 hours on the net looking for alternatives to Koni (due to
price). These are probably nothing new to ya tech. veterans, but may be of
interest to newbies somewhere like me.  There's what I found:

KYB's look pretty good. Unfortunately Gas-a-justs are mono-tube designed.
High pressured.  And as Jason @ Paragon pointed out, it can throw camber
off.  And as Koni Web page confirmed (and make sense), that high-pressured
shocks can extend the ride height to throw camber off if "randomly"
applied.  KYB do offer their Gas-a-just for 944 though.  But all
high-pressured mono-tube shocks are out of the question for any car that's
not stock ride height.  If yours is lowered (mine is), then the stock
length of HPressure shocks will extend and give you a funny little positive
camber.  

Forget American brands like Gabriel & Monroe, even if they have the size,
none of their models are performance oriented. I was told that the
Heavy-Duty versions would work to stiffen, but the problem of mono-tube
designed remained...and plus...I wasn't really serious about putting on a...

Tokico offers performance shocks w/5 position adjustible.  But on the issue
of price (which is why I'm looking around), Tokico 5-ways are MORE $$$ than
Koni.  
So I didn't look any further on it-

Well, anyway, my conclusion is that for stiffer shocks...there just doesn't
seem to be a way around the old: "It's a Porsche, what'd you expect" deal
on parts :(   So I guess the only thing I can do is save my money and get
my girlfriend x'mas gifts like packs of gum; or a set of Koni (for her to
give to me). 

Baa-Hummmbug,
-tony 944NA'87
hate X'mas: spend hard-earned $$$ on trash, trade for trash, call 'em gifts.
