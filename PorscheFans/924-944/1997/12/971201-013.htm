Wow, the prices listed below sound pretty sweet to me. I recently inquired
about the price for the same relays for an S2 and was quoted $147(!) from
the local Porsche Dealer. Does anyone know where to get one cheaper? Right
now, I do most of my driving without it - works great unless you get stuck
in traffic :-)

Thanks,

It seems that fan and cooling troubles continue for me but near their end.
I
have traced my problem to a faulty fan relay.  Sometimes it works, other
times it does not.  Mine is an ’83 so I was in for what I thought wa a
pleasant surprise.  The fan relay was only $9.00 from the dealer.  the
‘85-’86 relay is $80.00  But, as it turns out, nothing is easy.  I gladly
left the dealer having spent only $9.00 to fix my problem.  But when I got
home, my car has the ‘85-’86 relay in it!  And, there is an additional
connection in the newer relay that connects to a wire that DOES exist in my
relay receptacle!

How can this be?  My car was made in May of 1983.  I know Porsche was big on
implementing changes as they were manufactured but we’re talking May of 1983
that the parts books list going to 1985 models!

The part number I was given runs from ’83 to ’85 (early) and is number
141.951.253B

The part in my car that is for late ‘85-’86 is 944.615.104.01

Anyone have any ideas?  The later relay has a connection labeled for port
number 4 that the early one does NOT.  Since my receptacle has a wire port 4
I am loath to use the early relay, But I also don’t want to spend another
$70.00 if I don’t have to.  Other than number 4, both relays connect to
ports
numbered 85, 86 and 87.

Any ideas would be welcomed at this end.
