Dave --

Thanks for getting back to us on the power subject.

Which synthetic oil are you using?

A lot of aftermarket companies will be most disappointed if the word gets
around.

I've run the 2.5 liter w/out a balance shaft timing belt when I was in the
processing of troubleshooting a f***** u* engine from Vertex. They
installed the lower balance shaft upside down. Needless to say, the
virbration was bad. Before the problem got sorted out, I removed the belt
and the vibration was gone. Perhaps it was the contrast, but the engine
seemed pretty smooth w/out the belt.  Porsche always claimed that the 944
ran smoother WITHOUT balance shafts than the original Mitsubishi design ran
WITH balance shafts.  However, I'm not sure I'm ready to try this with a 3
liter engine -- has anyone done this?
Moreover, I was told by a Porsche engine rebuilder that you can buy a few
parts that allow you to completely remove the balance shafts. Some racers
evidently do this as a matter of course.

Too bad. But does that mean your car is pinging away and you don't know it?
