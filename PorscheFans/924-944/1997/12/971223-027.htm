David, Ezra, PFans --

I'd like to take this opportunity to be educated on these tests myself.

I was taught that the way to distinguish between bad rings or valve seals
was to check compression, then add a little oil to chamber, and check
compression again.  If the compression increased, the rings were bad. If
compression was low, and did not increase, the valve guides/seals were bad.
 The rate at which maximum compression was reached was of less importance. 
A further complication was that if there were considerable carbon deposits
at the valves or seats, the effect would be similar to bad valve
seals/guides.  Carbon deposits could also cause a leakdown test to suggest
bad valve seals or guides.  I would assume that 944 owners are less likely
to suffer carbon deposits than the general population.  How close am I?
