The cooling fans on my 1980 931 don't come on after I shut the engine
off.  During normal driving, the fans cycle off and on, so I don't
believe the switch is at fault.  (I did change it any way.)  Looking
at the Haynes wiring diagram, when the engine is off, the fans run at
a low speed by means of a resistor.  My local dealership can get the
resistor, but my question is - where is it?  I've looked under the dash,
in the engine compartment, and I just don't see it.

I've also heard it could be a problem with a fan run-on switch.  I don't
see any mention of this switch.

Any help in locating the resistor or helping with this problem is
appreciated.

=0A=09As far as the trans poping out of third gear, I say it is probably =
