Hello Sam,

Your car is trying to tell you something:

DON'T FLOOR IT UNTIL IT'S WARMED UP!!!!

This is VERY bad for the motor, turbo, transaxle, and the rest of
the driveline. 

When the car is cold, the oil in the engine is cold (and relatively
thick). Same thing with the gear oil in the transaxle. The cold
oil does not flow as well as warm oil, this means that your are
not getting proper lubrication. Keep flooring the engine when
it's cold, and soon you'll need ANOTHER rebuild.

ALWAYS wait for the engine to warm up (this doesn't take all that
long, perhaps 5-10 minutes of driving) before driving the car
hard. Once it's warm, drive as hard as you like, just let the
car cool off by driving gently, or letting it idle for 30 seconds
or so before turning it off.

FYI, this problem is WORSE for turbo cars. The turbocharger requires
a lot of fresh oil for long life. Use a lot of boost before the car
is warm, and you do two things: You force the turbo to spin without
enough lubrication, which is very bad, and you put a very high
load on the turbo, which is also very bad.

So, do yourself, and your car a favor, and stop flooring it right
after starting it.

Hi Guys,

Can you please help? I have an 86 951 and for a few weeks when I would start
in the morning the idle would stumble and die on the first try, on restart the
car ran fine.the other day I was driving and getting a lot of hesitation and
the car wanting to stall. This morning I went out to start the car and it
started then died. When I restarted it the idle jumped fom about 800 rpm to
2000 then it settled into a very very lumpy idle and died. Same thing on
restart. Car starts and then idles like a tank and dies... Any ideas? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ben
