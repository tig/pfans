	I know, for many of you, hearing about air conditioning
problems at Christmas time is annoying, but I replaced the
a/c clutch cause the 7.5 amp fuse kept blowing when I would
activate the system.  It appeared, when we first tested it,
that the fuse did not blow when the clutch was disconnected
so we hoped that was the problem.  Well, not only am I
still hot (South Florida), but I'm poorer, and suspect the
mechanic is guessing.  What other parts of the system run
through the fuse?  Could it be the relay?  Is there a cheap
generic relay I might try.  Yesterday, the a/c ran fine for
about five minutes in the driveway and about 3/4 of a mile
down the road til the fuse blew, so I know that the
compressor still works.
I also checked the internals of the switch as I had
replaced it myself a year ago.  All the solder joints
seemed tight, but could this be the problem? Should I
resolder?

	Merry Xmas, Happy chanukah
