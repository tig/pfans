Hi, Matthew...




1 A couple of weeks ago, the heated rear screen packed up. The little light
on the switch still works but there is no power at the connection to the
hatch. I have no wiring diagramme for the car, but no fuses appear to be
blown. Any thoughts.

....There are two fuses that control the power to the heated rear
hatch screen, and one relay... Check for the relay clicking and the 
fuses not to be blown...

2 Shortly after that failure, the windscreen washer pump also failed.
Nothing happens at all, no whirring or noises of any sort. As yet, I
haven?t checked for power at the pump, though.

..... check for power at the pump.


3 On a completely different matter, the heater seems very erratic. It takes
an age for any warm air to start coming - the engine temperature guage has
to be on the 3/4 mark (last before the red zone) before I get anything at
all. Then it?s only a few minutes to near-tropical conditions inside the
car. If the heater control is turned below 3/4 fully-on, it?s back to cold
air again.

....Your thermostat may be of the wrong kind, or not working properly.


4 Related to this, switching the heater fan on to full causes the enginge
temperature guage to jump about half a mark! So, with the fan full on, the
engine always appears to be running hot.


....Check the ground to the gauges and the heater... you may be getting 
some kind of feedback...


5 The oil pressure guage is all over the place, the needle thrashing around
like snake on acid. Because of this it?s hard to establish an accurate
reading, but it seems to be:-
Cold -         4.5 to 5 bar at idle (or pegged out if the outside temp is
below 5 celsius)
          Pegged out at 2500 rpm or over

Warm -    1.5 to 2 bar at idle (slightly less if the engine is very hot)
          4 to 5 bar at 2500 rpm or over
Are these values okay/acceptable?


....These values are normal for this kind of car. The jumping needle 
typically means that the oil pressure sender (mounted on the engine 
near the oil filter) is kaput.

....Hmmm, a snake on acid? Never seen that, but, like the saying goes,
"If you can remember the 60's, you weren't part of the 60's."

Good Luck!
