Hi, Joe and the rest,

I agree wholeheartedly.  Until recently, I was subscribed to five
different listservers of various topics.  While the other lists have
only a few hundred members each, I was getting over two-hundred messages
a day!  Most of these messages were either off-topic or members trading
"witty" remarks with each other.  Needless to say, useful information
was hard to come by.  PorscheFans is THE most valuable resource for
Porsche info and camaraderie that I've come across.  Thanks, everyone!
