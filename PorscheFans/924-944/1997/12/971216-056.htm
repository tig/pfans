I don't know -- it is difficult to mark the lower front shock mounts so
accurately as to reinstall without changing camber. Porsche recommends a
new alignment after changing any suspension components including shocks.

I don't understand this. Using a higher pressure shock absorber may
raise ride height, but how will it decrease negative camber? Negative
camber increases whenever vertical forces at the wheels are increased,
within the tolerances of the drop-links, tie-rods etc. A higher pressure
shock will exert (near) vertical pressure in both directions. The
component of force in the upward direction will result in higher ride
height, but the component in the downward direction (every action has an
equal and opposite....) will result in increased negative camber.

Aside from suspension adjustment, the only time negative camber should
decrease will be in the event of significantly lowering vehicle weight,
and/or tired/lo-pressure shocks. If the sum of vertical forces on the
wheels is decreased -- such as when the frame of the car is going up on
a hoist -- negative camber will also decrease rapidly.

I just bought a 1986 944 turbo with 92000 miles.  I had it checked out at
IMPORT AUTOHAUS and they said it had a small leak around the water pump.  He
suggested a water pump and a timing belt for 1100. Also---If you get this work
done, get the cam and crank seal replaced as well.  It's not but 75.00 more
and will save you money in the long run.  Justin   Jsharry@aol.com

In a message dated 97-12-16 16:16:37 EST, you write:

<< I do not know about the 5W-30 recommendation, sounds too light, but I have
 not read the article yet. >>
 
I just filled my 951 w/ 5W-30 Mobile One.  I haven't driven it yet though,
because I'm waiting on the rest of my front suspension which should be here
tomorrow.  If I notice anything different from the 15W-50, I'll post it.
