Hi Everyone:
           I am in desperate need of help. I my brother today in Berlin 
(very cold, -20 deg.) and I told him call the "towing" service. After 
they fired the engine up (the battery was dead) they noticed that the 
car did not register any oil pressure and told him that the must must be 
taken immediately to a shop! I should add that this is a pre-paid 
service and that they have no interest or participation in repair, it is 
merely a towing service.
         Here are some facts: The car was not driven for a few months, 
and the last time it has been driven the pressure was fine. So, what is 
the problem? It's a 944 '83 (110,000 miles) and I'm using 15W-40 mineral 
oil, not the best, but I has worked find on all the other cars 
(Mercedes-Benz, Volvo). 
         Can it be the oil pump, it would seem odd to give out so 
suddenly. It greatly appreciate any information. Happy Holidays.
