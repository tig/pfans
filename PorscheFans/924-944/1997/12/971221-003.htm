What people have to realize is prices for the same car vary across
geography and time of year and, of course, individual cars vary - in
condition, options, motivation of the buyer, etc.

For instance, in many areas of North America, if you *have* to sell your
Porsche right now, you aren't going to get that much for it - in fact, you
will get more for it in the spring. In other areas, winter is irrelevant.

>39000 miles that he has seen sell for 12000 and a mint 1989 Turbo S for

A trend specific to S2's is that their typical used value is very close the
'88 turbo S/'89 turbo. (This has also been noted in Excellence, with Mr.
Anderson noting "Personally, I would prefer a 1988 Turbo S or 1989 Turbo
which cost less and give better performance, although the S2 gives better
low-end performance because of its larger displacement and doesn't exhibit
turbo lag" (pge 82, vol 68))

Before I get flamed, I'm not saying the intrinsic *worth* of the car is the
same as turbo S, I'm just saying people are spending about the same money
for one, which means the S2 has held more of its (resale) value than a late
Turbo.

>like to point out what most people buying and selling cars realize; that my

And your price is close to market value asking price if you look at "book
value" listings on the 'net, again depending on where you are. 

Just my 0.02cents CDN.
Craig.
- who doesn't give a flying ---- about the resale value of his S2, as he is
about to destroy any such value by welding a roll cage into it.
