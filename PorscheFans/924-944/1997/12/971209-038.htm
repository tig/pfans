After my historical note, here is a recount of my own experience.

After its '85 failure, my 120k 944 had its belts replaced without fail every
3 years or 36k miles. One day, in fifth gear and 4000rpm (no UK policeman
need know that this is about 90mph) I had a total loss of power, and had to
coast into a lay-by. Cranking the engine on the starter revealed no
compression.

The cam belt and balancer shaft belt were both intact. The problem was the
cam belt tensioner pulley had broken up. It has ball bearings, but none were
to be found inside the plastic cover when my mechanic dismantled it. Who
knows were they had gone. The car had definitely been feeling odd before the
failure - lacking in power. So I knew that something was wrong - I only wish
I had known _what_ was wrong.

Further investigation uncovered several failures of the pulley, all at 100k
miles, or more. This is a GBP30 item. Its failure cost me at least GBP1600.
(That's about USD 2300.) I now say that it is a service-replacement item,
and will be changed with my next belt change at 102k on my present car.

For the record, I lost: 8 valves, 8 guides, and 8 hydraulic cam followers.
No pistons! With all the labour, gaskets, valve seals, head machining, and
general hassle (and a full service at the same time, why not!) my bill came
to about GBP2000. Geepers! I must either (a) really like these cars or (b)
be plain daft. No, I don't want an e-mail poll on this question, thanks :)

The moral is, replace that pulley if you want to sleep soundly. Also, for
those new to these cars who think we all harp on incessantly about the cam
belt - be warned: If you ignore it, it WILL go away, together with a hefty
chunk of your next couple of months' salary.
