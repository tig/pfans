Hey dudes,

First, I'll answer some common questions that a few have had.  The lip
spoiler in the pictures I posted yesterday is from AIR.  The fit is
crap, there is about 1/2" gap on one side or about 1/4" on both sides.
We will be trying a GT Racing one in the near future.  The lip does
look good from far though.

Second, I saw this post on the DSM list and thought it may be good
for you guys, especially those who race and are serious about keeping
their engine together, an EGT gauge is a very good resource to have,
and this price makes it stupid to not have one:

>Hey guys, sorry for the double post, but I just thought I'd share the
>cool stuff on cheap EGT gauges I've found.  I just got my 2" (could be 2
>1/4") Westach EGT gauge for $29.  I could've bought the standard type K
>thermocouple with it for $23, but since the gauge was so cheap I decided
>to try out this type K racing thermocouple for $43.  The racing
>thermocouple responds at 200 degrees F per second, and comes with a 2
>year warranty.  I ordered the gauge and separate lighting fixture ($3)
>from Aircraft Spruce and Specialty company
>(http://www.aircraft-spruce.com), and the thermocouple from Starting
>Line Products (http://www.srv.net/shop/slp/Polaris_Catalog/egt.html).
>SLP actually sells products for snowmobiles, but hey, whatever works!
>Check out their gauge cups too, they have some cool ones.
>
>If I had bought the normal type K probe from Aircraft Spruce, the total
>cost for EGT gauge, thermocouple, and lighting fixture would have been
>$56.86.  Wow, forget the automotive vendors that want $150+, I'm going
>with airplane gauges!  What I specifically ordered was the ultralight
>gauge, which doesn't have the square shock mount around it. The regular
>gauge is $36.25. 
>
>There's also a 2" Microflight EGT gauge that comes with the probe for
>$46.50.
>
>BTW - the EGT gauges I'm referring to all have the standard 700-1700 deg
>F range.
>
>For those of you who crave a gauge with multiple EGT readings, get the
>Westach Dual EGT for $66.25, and both probes for $47.90.  Heh, there's a
>Quad EGT gauge for anyone participating in the "most gauges" contest,
>for $141.30.  Hey Todd, didn't you and Tom Stangl figure out which
>cylinder specifically runs the leanest?  There's even combination
>EGT/Cylinder head temp gauges.  The possibilities are limitless!  As
>far as I know, the best price for an EGT gauge/probe out of every
>automotive vendor I've seen is $115 or $119 for the VDO from Racer
>Wholesale.  These airplane catalogs have a lot more cool crap to look at
>too, carbon fiber and kevlar sheeting, tools, welding gear, epoxys,
>decals, exhaust tubing, flanges, GPS stuff, fuel lines & fittings, high
>temp silicone air ducting, etc...
