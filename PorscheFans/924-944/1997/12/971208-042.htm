Hi, list members. I am a rare writer to the list so bare with my typing.

I have several items from form '86 944T (951) development car for sale. =
My 951 has been a low buck, Nevade open road project car for a little =
over a year. It has been a great performer with little problems over the =
other cars I have driven at this event. Last June we ran in the 140 =
average class seeing sustained 166's over 3 mile timing intervals =
including some sweeping turns in the segment. For a under $ 15,000 total =
investiment, it's been an amazing car. I am currrently running a K27 =
turbo with mods to the intake / intercooler runners, chips in the =
engine. Suspension mods are springs / sway bars from Weltmeister. This =

installed a Autopower rollbar.=20

With these recent component changes I have the following other pieces =
available:

1 set F/R Fikse "Mag" wheels 17 X 8, 17 X 9 with Yoko A-008P tires. They =
have been run approx. 5000 miles, and are in excellent shape. Asking $ =
2,200 for the set.

1 Bray-Krause Stainless Steel Harness bar. Great for putting 5 pt belts =
in any 944, turbo or N.A. unbelievably beautiful setup. Have Clamp rings =
for mouting fire extinguisher as well. - Paid $ 290, sell for $ 175.00

1 set stock springs, Sachs shocks, sway bars from '86 944 turbo. - Make =
