Second  ?
This one is difficult to describe so I'll do my best. The concise problem
is I'm having difficulty shifting into 1st and 2nd. To expound... From
standstill To get into 1st have to move shift lever laterally in neutral
until I feel some resistance, sort of a springy feeling. Then slide into
1st. But going into 1st there is a firm resistance before it slides in like
it catches on something. I can rarely shift from 1st to 2nd smoothly.
Ususaly have to shift into neutral and finesse it just as in the case of
1st.Shifting out of either gear into neutral is smooth. Sometime it will
NOT go into either gear. Strangely enough the symptoms are least with
engine cold and low ambient humidity(I know, sounds crazy) and worsens when
engin(tranny?) warm and/or high humidity. The feeling is that the shifter
will not go far enough to the left but I've got it all the way to the left
rim of the housing. In fact the metal is worn on the housing and I can't
use the inner boot because it won't let me move the lever left enough to
get into gear. 

For more history...I had a clutch job done soon after purschase by an
independent mech. Before the clutch job there was some difficulty shifting
but dont remember if it was the same symptoms. The day I got it back 1st
and 2nd gears were gone...would not shift into them no matter what. Took it
back to the mech, he brought it back in a few hours and it has shifted like
above since. Only recently have I had occasions where it would not shift
into 1st or 2nd and have to start in 3rd(please no flames, only rarely
occurs and is a necessity). I feel like it has something to do with the
shift rod, not the tranny. Does anyone have a clue what's going on?
