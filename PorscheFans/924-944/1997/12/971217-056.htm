Hi all...

This evening, in the middle of a relatively long drive on the freeway,
my 84 '944 started "bucking." That is, the engine would really bog down
and try to stall out. If I kept my foot on the gas, it would keep going
but bucking at me. If I took my foot off the gas, it would stall. If I
free-revved it in neutral, it would run just fine. Oddly, once I got off
the freeway, it started running ok. Any ideas, gang?

Alex.

Sorry Surya,  but I'm afraid you've lost me here.  Increasing gas pressure in
a shock absorber -- or installing stiffer springs -- acts on the sprung weight
of a car and, all other things equal, will cause it to ride higher to some
extent. 
With any independant suspension geometry I'm familiar with (any street car, at
least),  raising ride height increases positive/decreases negative camber at
the end of the car where the ride height is raised.  
As far as jacking a car by the wheels increasing negative camber,  I'm sure
you don't mean to imply that raising a car by its rear wheels, for example,
would increase negative camber at the rear, do you?  At the extreme, it would
cause more negative camber at the front and more positive at the rear, due to
the transfer of weight onto the front wheels.   Maybe that's what you meant,
and I'm just not following you.
