Clark,

Well, in my opinion it's most important when exiting a corner to have
the front end decidedly ahead of the rear end....if a 911 can't do that
easily how can anyone argue the fact that the 951 is a better
sportscar?  :)  I think I'll forward this to the 911 list.  I'd probably
get hate mail, email bombs, virus', and 911's running around Orlando
shooting up every red 944 they see, hoping to get me.  Nah, I'll just
keep the secret between you, me, and 1500 water-cooled enthusiasts on
this list.  When we see a 911, just giggle to ourselves and leave them
in the dark.  Do yo know how much they paid for their outdated, inferior
machine?  Know what their insurance runs?  Just feel pity for them and
leave it at that.  

By the way.  I AM only KIDDING.  I actually like 911's, and have a
secret oil cooled envy that I only let out of the closet once a year.  I
will own one someday, when I don't have to explain the lack of A/C and
oil burning smell to my date.  I'll still own a water-pumper though...  
:)
