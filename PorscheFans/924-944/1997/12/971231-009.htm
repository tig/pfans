The only problems I ran into on my 79 924 with the AUDI motor, were the =
various connections to the rear of the head due to the limited space. =
The Aux Pressure Regulator and the water hoses to the heater are a pain =
in the $#@!. Be prepared to do some contortions. Make sure a reputable =
shop does the valve work, pay particular attention to the condition of =
valve adjusting screws. If I remember correctly, they can be adjusted =
with a regular metric hex key, although Porsche does sell a special =
tool. (I think they may be in cahoots with the folks at Haynes). One odd =
thing you might want to check is the condition of the tube that splits =
the coolant line to the rear of the head and the heater. It's a solid =
metal tube on the left side of the engine with a bent section welded =
onto the side. Where the weld is made, there is only a small hole =
drilled into the main line, and on mine this hole had become clogged =
from calcium deposits or a previous owner not using the correct coolant =
for an aluminum block. I had to cut down the curved section so I could =
get a drill into it to clean it out as I was in panic mode at the time. =
Keep your eye out for junk yards that specialize in imports. Many parts =
from a VW Rabbit or an Audi will fit the 924 due to it's development and =
manufacturing history. Good Luck!
