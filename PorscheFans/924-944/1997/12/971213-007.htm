When did the M030 option makes it debut?

I have an 87 944 2.5 NA that I'm going to be autocrossing.  I want to race 
in stock classes, meaning I can't put anything on the car that wasn't 
available from the factory -- hence my search for a factory-installed 
suspension option.

Thus far, I haven't found any information about a sport suspension option 
for anything but S2's and 968's, but I'm hopeful there was such an option 
for the earlier 944s.  Anybody know anything about this?

My thanks,
dan woodman

Steve:

You aren't whining; you are being a demanding customer, which is exactly what
you should be.  I commend you for taking the step of posting your message.  If
Kempton has e-mail, make sure you send them a copy and let them know you have
shared your experience with a couple thousand of their (formerly) potential
customers.  

We marketing types have a continuum over which we spread customers, from
highly satisfied "apostles" at one end to highly dissatisfied "terrorists" at
the other.  (Please don't take offense at me applying that term to your
situation--I didn't make it up!)  An apostle can be expected to tell up to
five friends about a positive purchasing experience.  A terrorist can be
expected to tell up to fifteen friends about a poor experience.  The web, with
lists like this, has greatly increased the reach of dissatisfied customers,
thus giving them vastly more power, and will ultimately yield better provision
of goods and services to the buying public.  The same wide distribution of
info that punishes people who fail their customers will also reward those who
do a great job and gain apostles, like Jason at Paragon and George B. 

Go after them, and make them do right by you.  Please keep the list posted on
your results.

Terry
