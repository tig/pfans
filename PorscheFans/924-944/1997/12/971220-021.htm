There is no way to know exactly what is wrong, but very cold weather
will give symptoms like this, whether the oil simply will not pump when
it is that cold, or the sender won't work, who knows?   But there may not
be anything wrong.   I occasionally have the dreaded red light when I
start my truck on cold Montana mornings, and the remedy is to heat a
quart or two of oil and add it before trying to start again.    It has
always worked.  

Or the engine really did blow up . . .

<< I am
 about ready to call the tow truck, but before I do thought I'd give you
 guys a try. Please help! >>

Marshal,
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.  The slave is a bear to bleed.
evidently there's an air bubble in it that you've got to raise the rear of the
car to get out.  I had AAA tow the car to my mechanic and he bled it no
problme.
