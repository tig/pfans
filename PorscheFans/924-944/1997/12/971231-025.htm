I bought an aftermarket boost gauge from Powerhaus and installed it in
my 89 944T.  I thought I was boosting about 1.1 bar or about 16 lbs.
This gauge indicates that my peak boost in 3rd gear is 1.65 bar or over
24lbs.  My car is running great, but is this possible with the stock
turbo.  I have Autothority chips and a drilled cycling valve.  I think
the gauge is wrong but David Raines of Powerhaus told me his mechanic
said the gauge seemed to be working properly from the way I described
it.  I called Autothority and they seemed to think there is a problem
with the gauge.

My stock gauge reads 2 on the gauge even when I use the stock banjo
bolt.  If I watch the stock gauge and let off as soon as it touches the
2 in third gear my Greedy Gauge reads 1.4 bar boost.  Powerhaus said it
is possible to run this much boost as long as the fuel was good.  I use
one can of 104plus in a tank of gas 93 octane.  The people at
autothority seemed to think something would blow at these pressures.
Do I need to return the gauge or investigate further?

Ok- if everything possible checks out on an 86 turbo, why is there still no
boost?
Tried substituted electronics, replaced all swithes and sensors, rebuilt the
turbo, bypassed exhaust and wastegate. No leaks under vacuum or pressure. ????
With 135K on car is it possible that the knock sensor reads any vibration and
is shutting the fuel down?
I'm sure it is something simple, what do you think?
Thanks
