Yesterday I got tired of watching the girlfriend struggle while
squeezing the door handle on the passenger side of my 85.5 944.  I took
the door panels off, thouroughly greased everything in there with a
toothbrush and grease, removed and adjusted the threaded clip thing that
comes from the outside handle to the mechanism (just look in there,
you'll see what I mean).  It took me a total of an hour to do both door,
and that's after adjusting the drivers side to far out on the threaded
thingy.  It popped off (after I had reassembled the door) and the
outside handle stops working....  Anyway, I went back in and threaded it
on again.  The doors now open with ease and as I said...piece of cake. 
A dozen or so phillips screws, a few plastic popmeoffs and the panel
lifted right off.  Don't know if the S2 is different, but I'd imagine
it's about the same thing.

<< >OK, I am going to try the Jim Conforti/Larry Bershtein chips in my 951, >>


All,
First, since we're all congratulating and flaming people and organizations,
I'ld like to thank Larry Bershtein.  When I bought a used DME, I broke the leg
off of the performance chip in my original DME.  For a minor fee (which I know
couldn't cover the time required to pack, ship, read, and burn a new chip)
Larry read the code from my chip, burned me a new one and sent them back.

Secondly, regarding dyno testing.  Has anyone had any experience with the
small accelerometer (sorry about the spelling) based dynos that are out there
for under $200?  They are supposedly quite accurate.  You input the cars
weight (I'm not sure about drag coefficient, I know the higher line dynos of
this type allow multiple car parameters to be input), and using the
accelleration it reads, can calculate your HP at any instant.  Additionally,
it automatically will calculate your 1/4 mile and 0-60 time.

PS:  I think w/ one of these and a Bear Tracker to go along w/ my Valentine 1,
I'ld be set with gadgets!
