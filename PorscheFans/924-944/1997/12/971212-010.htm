>==================================

I wholeheartedly agree with what Menelaos says, not from a substantiated
"technical article" standpoint, but, rather, personal observations.  Not
only is there a substantial "thud or clunk" when the hatch reaches its full
open position, but there can also be a substantial amount of twisting in
the frame due to the fact that no two shocks are identical, therefore, they
won't be exerting the same force on both sides of the frame.

Another point to remember is that when you are closing the hatch, always
use both hands (one placed above each latching point) to avoid further
twisting.  And, don't just slam the hatch and walk away - firmly close the
hatch and then place your hands under the spoiler and gently try to lift
the hatch.  Otherwise, you aren't always assured that it is secure - ever
drive down the road and have your hatch open by itself unexpectedly?  It
has happened to me and I've seen it happen to others often.
