I am currently thinking of getting either a 924S (1987 or 1988) or a 944 
and I am wandering what sort of modifications without chipping can be 
done and what sort of improvement do they give.  ie. 0-60 times, 
increase in torque and bhp.  Also an idea of cost would be good.

Ideas currently considering are :-
Increase throttle body
K&N Performance Cone Air Filters


What sort of exhaust mods can be done?  What effect do they have.

Don't really want to modify the engine as all I was looking for was 15 
to 20 additional bhp.  Would consider some Head work (polishing ports or 
shimming to increase compression etc) but no boring etc.

What is the effect on smog tests? (california)

Is it worth shimming the head (increase compression)?  Is is useable on 
everyday fuel? Does the injection system need modification?

What are peoples experiences with such ventures.
