I was following the thread on Chevy V8 conversions for the 944.  There
is a company at http://www.renegadehybrids.com that has been doing just
that for years.  Anything from 914's to 928's they have a kit for.  The
LT1 Will fit completely under the hood with the stock injection.  The
transaxle is retained and a modified chevy bellhousing is used to make
the connection.  As mentioned before the weight shift is less
significant with the Lt1 than expected.  This can be futher reduced with
lightweight after market parts.  Of course a donor Turbo car would be
best suit because of the upgrade transaxle, brakes, and cooling.  I'm
waiting for the Right car to come along as we speak.  The 87&88 S models
can be found with destroyed heads rather easily.  If anyone is
interested in more info e-mail me directly and I'll tell you what I
know.  Most people just can't seem to do such horrible things to there
Porsche.  Let me get this straight, I hate most american cars but the
LT1 is extremely reliable, developed, and easily modified.  It's all the
crap surrounding the engine that turns me off.  Frames welcome!!!
