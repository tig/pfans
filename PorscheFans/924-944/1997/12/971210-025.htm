Howdy,

I've noticed quite a few 944 drivers are here in B.C. Canada.  I noticed
a new name in yesterday's digest with an S2.  Where are all of you?  How
come I don't see you at the track or autox???  You have to, at least once,
drive your car hard in an auto-x, track event or hillclimb, or a race if
you are so inclined.  Contact me at fkassam@direct.ca for more info on
local racing stuff.  There are tons of p-fans on this list that would be
willing to help you out, myself, Paul, Darren, Wes, and now even Alex.
The more p-cars out at the event, the more fun and competitive our region
will become.

I was doing some fun calculations and thought you'd like to see them with
the kart racing stuff.  Boy, is this stuff expensive!  I could have had a
2.8L stroker motor with a K27 and big brakes with all these expenditures!

Anyhow, the calcs I was doing were, power to weight (lbs/hp).  Remember,
that the kart I will be racing is geared for a max speed around 60mph @
15,500rpm +/- 1000rpm so that compares well to the 1st gear on a 951.  If
power to weight is similar, then you can get a feel for how the kart will
be like by flooring your car in 1st gear, just imagine that you are 0.25"
off the ground while doing it with no steel around you.  Here are the 
numbers:

Yamaha 100cc piston port (racing this year), 18hp & 310lbs = 17.22 lbs/hp
Blueprinted Yamaha 100cc piston port (6mon), 21hp & 310lbs = 14.76 lbs/hp

My kart/driver weight combo is actually only 150lbs + 125lbs = 275 lbs, but
I have to carry some lead (some serious lead!) to get up to the minimum of
310lbs total.

Once you move on to different motor classes, you can get engines from 25hp
up to around 35-40hp in 100cc.

A 25hp engine would give 12.40 lbs/hp and 35hp would give 8.86 lbs/hp.

I'm not sure if you lose anything in driveline losses in a kart because the
one I'll be running this year is a clutch kart, but I'm sure it's less than
a car.  Here are the numbers of a 944T to compare:

87 944T stock @ 217hp = 14.88 lbs/hp
89 944T stock @ 247hp = 13.08 lbs/hp
89 944T chips @ 290hp = 11.14 lbs/hp
97 911T stock @ 400hp =  8.50 lbs/hp

Just some fun numbers to think about.

Farzaan.

Yes, tie rods and wheel bearings. More likely tie rods, as if the wheel
bearings were that bad you would likely notice other symptoms like vibrations
when braking. Easy to check, just jack up the suspected wheel, preferably by
the outer end of the a-arm, but be sure to cushion the jack with something.
Then check for play in the bearings by grasping the tire at the 12 and 6
oclock positions and feel for play. There should be close to none, and if you
cannot get rid of it by adjusting the bearings per the manual, the bearings
may be tired, but its more likely the tie rods. Check these by grabbing the
wheel at the 9 and 3 oclock positions and move back and forth as if steering.
There should be no play and the slightest movement of the wheel should give a
corresponding movement of the steering wheel. A tiny bit of play here will
produce a surprising clunk. Try some fairly strong sudden movements which may
be necessary to overcome the grease and spring pre-load which some steering
units have (not sure about these) I have not had any experience replacing
these, some cars its possible, others not. Good luck
