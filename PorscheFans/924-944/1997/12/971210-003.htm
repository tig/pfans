<<     1.  Replace the timing and balance shaft belts every 30000 miles.
     2.  After a timing belt replacement, have the tension checked
before
1800 miles.
     3.  There is nothing concrete to support that the belts should be
replaced after 3
           years if 30000 miles is not reached. However, the
representative
at PCNA        did emphasize that "the cars are meant to be driven" and
agreed that              replacing the belts periodically if the car was
not driven a lot was a good idea.  4.  Porsche does recommend that, for
new
cars, a complete check of the car       (including timing belt) be done
at
the two year point and yearly thereafter.          This recommendation
is
irrespective of the mileage on the car.
     5.  I asked if the recommendation had been 45000 miles. The
representative I         talked to wasn't positive but said that the
recommendation probably was       45000 miles at one time. >>


I checked my owner's manual for the 93 968 and the recommended
replacement interval for the timing belt is 60000 miles.  The re-tension
check is done after 2000 to 2500 miles.  There is also a note that for
MY 1992 and earlier, the change interval is at 48000 miles.  Take this
information for what it's worth but I'm playing it safe.
