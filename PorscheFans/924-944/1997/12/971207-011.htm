Hi,

I posted this last week but it does not seem to have been posted, would be
interested to know if others find the same rust problem.

WARNING

I recently experienced a leak from the petrol tank, the garage floor was
covered, glad I was not smoking when I opened the door.
Removing the strap on the pump side of the tank revealed a pin hole and a
very rusty strip. Externally the tank looked perfect but removing the strap
showed that the rust had eaten into the tank from the outside.
It looks like water runs down the back of the strap and rust starts. The
plastic strip between the strap and the tank does not stop it.
I suggest that it worth some time undoing the 13mm nut (long socket) and
bending back the strap and inspecting the area on all 924's and 944's. If
rust has started a two part resin would seem the ideal treatment, if it has
not gone too far.
Replacement is lots of fun (start by removing tranmission).

I hope my problem is not yours.

Regards

Richard Luker
