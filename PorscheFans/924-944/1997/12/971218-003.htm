Hi,

Apropos comments about the 996.  At the PCA-Germany Region I had a chance to
drive the 996 around Patrick Henry Village (Heidelberg) and on the Autobahn
a bit.  I was quite impressed with the handling on the on ramps under power,
among other things, but I must say that in terms of power it was quite a
disappointment compared to my 951. As everyone would already guess: better
low end torque, weaker about 3500RPM. It also seemed to wobble a bit at
higher speeds, but I was told that was due to the winter tires. My 951 seems
more stable at high speeds (greater than 120 MPH).  At low speed, the 996
just seemed to tuck down on corners and felt surprisingly stable.

The biggest surprise, though, was that I liked the way it looked.  To be
honest, I had been a 996 hater after seeing the car in pictures in magazines
and such, but in person it looked much better.  Not just much better... I
actually really liked it! It looks more muscular in person, not all puffy
like I thought from the photos.  I would gladly take one as an X-mas gift.
The tail sort of had a retro louvered appearance too, for some reason.  I
also liked the tiptronic (that is once I figured out that the shift buttons
were on the steering wheel. Can you say "DUHHHH!")

Ok, now to 944 content: The power windows on my 951 wind up reeeeeeealllllly
slooooooowwwwww.  It is getting annoying, especially now in the German
winter when they go up and down even slower and I NEED then to go up and
down REALLY fast (Brrrrrr!) Any thoughts or suggestions?

-Tim
