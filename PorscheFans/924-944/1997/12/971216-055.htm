Steve,
   Roxanne has offered you some very sound advise. If you think your water
pump has 90,000 miles on it -- replace it. It will likely fail before your
next belt change. I have seen a number of water pumps with high miles fail
just after a timing belt change. It seems that the higher tension initially
applied to new belts (to allow for stretch) is enough to do in the bearings
on a water pump that is nearing the end of its life. I recently replaced a
water pump on my own 951 that locked up about 1500 miles after a timing
belt replacement. I have only had the car for about three years and the
records I had showed the water pump only had about 60000 miles on it.
Fortunately, I recognized it immediately and stopped the car before the
water pump pulley (which of course wasn't moving) could wear through the
timing belt (about 1/16 of an inch left - Hallelujah brother!). Anyway, the
same thing can happen with a failed roller. To replace the water pump, all
the rollers have to come off anyway. I would replace all the rollers just
for the piece of mind. However, if you want to save some bucks, have your
mechanic spin each roller and see how if feels and how it sounds. If any
are suspicious - replace them. I hate to recommend spending more money but,
I would also replace the balance shaft seals and the front main seal. It's
likely  they've never been done either and if they start leaking, it will
trash your new belts. 

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
