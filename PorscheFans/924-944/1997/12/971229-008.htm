I read sometime this last weekend about an external boost gauge and hav=
e seen
one advertised in the latest Excellence issue.  My question is this:  I=
s the
gauge effective if one has Autothority's version 2.7 chipset installed =
with the
banjo bolt modification?  My understanding is that the modification is =
to
"trick" the DME into thinking that less boost is being delivered than a=
ctually
is.  Where does the aftermarket gauge get "plugged" into so that it rea=
ds the
boost level?  Wouldn't an aftermarket gauge's reading be inaccurate if =
it reads
the boost downstream of the banjo bolt?

Also read Pascha's latest article regarding 944 turbo's.  He mentioned =
using
Garrett turbo's (can't remember which ones) as a performance enhancemen=
t.
Anyone used a Garrett?

Anyone used an adjustable boost controller similar to GReddy's system? =
 I
remember Farzaan discussing this at one time but can't remember the
conclusion.  GReddy seemed very reluctant to offer advice or a system f=
or a 951?

The thread on "beltfest" is interesting.  The gentleman from Canada pro=
bably
does not see the humor in "thong" bikini's since he probably has never =
seen one
and therefore does not know what they are.  The summers in Minnesota ar=
e so
short that the thong has barely made it here let alone in Canada (tee-h=
ee).

for everyone who has been looking for 944 scale models, I know of a few that
are made, but, unfortunately, no one make a model of a 944na, they are all
951's, the one I have is made my Italeri and imported from testers, it is of a
86 951, they used to offer an S2 cab. model also, but in the past few years, I
have heard that these have been discontinued, but if you look around there
might still be some in wharehouses, there are several racing and non-racing
951 models still available from Hasagawa and fugimi, your local hobby shops
should be able to order you one without a hassle, hope this helped someone
(probably not).
