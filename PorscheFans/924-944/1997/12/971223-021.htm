What's all the fuss about?  If these modifications provide a little extra
power and responsiveness, that's great.  But it's hard to imagine that they
will onset a lack of driving skill at a racing event.  I'd still bet my
money on the experienced driver with a well-tuned suspension and no power
modifications.

Merry Christmas. And faster lap times to all in a Happy New Year.  My
resolution will be smooth, smooth, smooth -- on and off the track.
