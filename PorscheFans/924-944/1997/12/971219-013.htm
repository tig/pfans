The one constant in the Universe must be owners of 2.5 liter, 8-valve
engines searching for more power.  Or owners of any engine searching for
more power. With a few sage exceptions that don't include me.  

Not a flame, Tony, but your car handles very well. Forget the power and
work on the suspension.  My S2 has 60 more hp than yours, and I'm still
getting out-lapped by good drivers using your engine.  None of the mods you
mention will get you what you want.  If you must have more power, you might
take Marv's above advice, or get a cheap 951 w/ an intact body and rebuild
the existing components.  But the best thing to do is to trade your car in
on a good one with the power you want ASAP before you spend anymore of the
down payment on parts that won't get you much in return.
