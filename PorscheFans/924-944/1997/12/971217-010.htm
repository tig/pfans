MR--

I installed the German Auto, now Supercharging of Knoxville, supercharger
kit on a late '85 944.  It's a good kit, not too hard to install yourself,
and yes, it does provide more power, probably 40-80 hp, depending on shape
of the engine, whether or not you get an intercooler, fan options and
pulley sizes.  Your '86 has a low enough compression ratio to make it
eligible for forced induction. The package costs $3800-4300, depending on
what options you get (oil cooler, intercooler, etc.). It's a Paxton unit
that runs off a common belt with the alternator and AC compressor.

I would recommend (and so did German Auto) that you rebuild the engine
first, and perhaps use Raceware parts.  If your engine has any weak points,
and one w/ 160K miles probably does, supercharging will find them and blow
oil out of all of them. If your engine has much blow-by (check for oil in
the air filter box), you definitely need a rebuild.  Be prepared to knock
out or replace the cat to get the full benefit.  Also be prepared for quite
a bit of supercharger whine. Some folks love it. I wasn't fond of it.

About your notion of what is cost effective, you might want to give this
some thought.  My S2 is more of a blast to drive than my supercharged '85,
more refined while it does it, and it's stock.  Bottom line is if you want
to go this route, first make your engine and drivetrain bullet-proof, and
be prepared to do a little additional tuning after the installation.  One
the positive side, supercharging an NA car is definitely one of the more
exciting and interesting things to do on the weekend.  If things go
smoothly, it should take about 2 days. Supercharging of Knoxville assumes
10 hours.  Let me know if you want more info.
