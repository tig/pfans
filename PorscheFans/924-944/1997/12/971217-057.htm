Hehehehe. Very good.

My only fear is that subscribers here would post to their list without
being members of the 911 list, and 911 list members would respond back to
the 924-944 mailing list without subscribing first, causing thousands of
repeating e-mails (a la cheesehead/sport seats) and the list-server to
explode... truly bringing in the new year with a bang!

 Hey P-Car fans!
Merry Christmas  to an interesting bunch of guys ( and Roxanne !) One thing to
keep in mind when trying to decide if furnishing your own parts is a good
idea. If you furnish a mechanic with defective or wrong parts, you can't
expect him to remove and replace them for the original labor charge. I saved
about $20 each on turbo motor mounts and had my guy install them( $200 labor)
Two weeks later one went out. Automotion replaced them @ no charge but  I had
the labor to pay again. If the shop had furnished them, there would have been
no additional charge. I guess what I'm saying is ... Weigh the amount of money
saved against money risked. Also , this may sound obvious, but find out in
advance what you will be charged for a part.  Because of my previous experence
with the motor mounts, I let my mechanic supply the parts for the repair of my
automatic transmission (rubber dampener). I assumed that because I could get
one for 3-4 hundred dollars that he could ( and would)also. WRONG! $800 wrong!
 Due to this and his keeping my car 7 weeks!! ( never say "Take your time") I
have a new mechanic. I also do many little things myself. I'm lucky in that I
have acess to a complete shop, Lifts, strut compressors, Hunter  infa-red
alignment machine, etc. but 12 hours is the longest time I can tie up a stall.

HI P-car fans!
  I have a couple questions about the 924 carrera GT variants. I know this
might sound funny but I collect minatures (toys) of Porsches and was recently
sent a Corgi 944, but it has what I believe is 924 Carrera bodywork. Did they
come with a single , center mounted front windshield wiper? The way-cool hood
scoop... was this for the intercooler? And the rear fenders appear wider and
wrap around the rear -end and tail lights  creating a vent or duct on both
sides. Is this for air removal after brake cooling? I have seen a kit for
$1295 for Carrera GT  includes front nose,front fenders, rear bolt on flares,
rocker panels, hood scoop, wheel well tubs & templates. from I.F.C. in Racine,
Ohio. Has anyone had any experience with this company and hopefully, this kit?
Also if anyone knows a web-site with some good photos of these cars, please e-
mail me. TIA
