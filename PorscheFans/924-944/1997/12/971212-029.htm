The Automotion chips are made by our friends at Dinan.  Dinan chips as a
general rule offer little performance gain except at WOT.  So, this seems
to support previous claims.  Dinan chips are also known for being fairly
"tame".  I know that I switched the chip in my E30 M3 (uh-oh, I better put
my flame retardant suit) from a Dinan to a Jim Conforti chip and the
performance was VASTLY superior with the Jim C. chip.  It has become fairly
common knowledge in BMW circles that the Jim C. chip is the one to get.
Jim has been working with Larry B.(formerly of Autothority) to make some
good 951 chips (among other Porsche chips.)  They sent me one to test but
due to my bad car accident I have been unable to test the set out yet.  If
they perform as well as I expect them to, we should be selling them in the
future.  Oh well, I didn't want this to turn into an advertisement.

But, my guess is that there are many chips that will out perform the
Automotion (Dinan) chip going on my experience with their chips in other
cars.  If you want a fairly "safe" chip, the Dinan would probably be a good
choice.  If you live in the Bay Area, I would be happy to demonstrate the
chips as soon as I install them.  YMMV.  

On another tangent, I know Jim C. has also made some Quad chips (I have one
for my M3).  These are chips that use a toggle switch to go into different
modes.  The one for my M3 has four modes.  The first is a valet mode.
Second offers bone stock performance.  Third is his excellent performance
map.  The fourth is designed for a full race car (No CAT, race fuel,
etc...)  I am not sure if such a chip is possible with the 944 Motronic
set-up.  Anyway, I am sure someone else out there may know more than me.
