The S2 intake opens at 4 degrees after TDC. It's hope fully advanced 2
degrees at 7000 ft.

Since the S2 has two cams, guess you could play with either the timing belt
sprocket or the cam chain, and independently change cam timing for intake
and exhaust. Ever try just advancing the timing belt a tooth? I have no
idea what that would be in terms of degrees.  With the 4-valve models, you
could potentially advance the cam chain a link on one or both cams. Don't
think I'd want to be the first one to try it, though.
Must be some insight to be gained from the 968, where you can independently
play with both the ignition and cam timing.  If I recall correctly, Porsche
progressively retards the intake cam timing by 15 degrees with increasing
rpms.

Is this for real?
