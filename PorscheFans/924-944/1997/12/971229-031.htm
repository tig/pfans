I'm thinking about taking "The Plunge".  My '87 944 Turbo needs a motor =
rebuild.  I'm considering the possibility of maybe doing the job myself, =
perhaps, possibly (he says with great confidence).  I have a number of =
questions (ok, a LOT of questions) for the collective wisdom of the =
list:
=20
The Plan
-------------=20
Replace all valves, guides and seals. (should valve seats be replaced?)=20
Replace rod bearings=20
Replace main bearings=20
Replace piston rings=20
Replace pistons and rods (maybe)=20
Replace head, cam cover, and oil pan gaskets (and any other appropriate =
gaskets)
Machine work (see ?'s below)=20
Replace belts and rollers
=20
*Am I missing anything?
=20
Pull/Not Pull Engine
-----------------------------
I get the feeling that it's best (i.e. less work) to leave the motor in =
the vehicle while rebuilding it.  But, I'm seriously considering doing =
the clutch at the same time (...while walking on hot coals in a shark =
tank...).  So, is it possible to do the clutch with the motor out (vs. =
starting at the rear license plate bracket and moving toward the front =
of the vehicle, removing every screw, bolt, and fastener encountered =
until you reach the clutch)? Is it easier to do the rebuild AND clutch =
by pulling the motor.  Or is it best to do both jobs the "traditional" =
way.
=20
Machining=20
--------------
What machining should/has to be done?=20
Which of the machining can be done at home, which must be done by a pro? =

Estimated, ballpark, SWAG costs of machining?=20
=20
Turbo Rebuild
--------------------
I plan on having the turbo rebuilt.=20
Any recommendations on who should do it? who should NOT do it?
I'm considering Windward or PowerHaus or ???=20
=20
Tools
--------
What "special" (beyond sockets, combo wrenches, torque wrench, hammer) =
tools are required or highly desired for the job?=20

Upgrades/Improvements
-----------------------------------=20
I hope to do club racing in stock class someday, so I can't get real =
creative, but...
Currently planned upgrades:  wide fire-ring head gasket, Raceware studs, =
oil pan baffle, turbo cup clutch.=20
What other upgrades/improvements can I make in the process of the =
rebuild that will improve durability or performance (again, performance =
gains must be legal per PCA club racing stock class rules)?=20
Any "while you're in there" tasks that are recommended?=20
=20
Concerns
-------------
My lack of experience in examining parts to determine if they should be =
replaced/repaired.  Especially worrysome are the pistons and rods, the =
cylinder walls and the head.=20
I could just replace the pistons and rods without discretion, but that =
would raise the cost quite a bit.

Testing
-----------
Once the thing is reassembled, are there any checks/tests that can be =
done, before turning the key, to verify that things have come together =
properly?=20
=20
Sanity
---------
Am I crazy for attempting such a job?
=20
Any and all advice is welcome!
Thanks!

In a message dated 97-12-29 20:11:39 EST, you write:

<< everythings fine, but when the
 car is first driven after sitting, when you floor it, and the turbo comes=
 
 on it shoots out black smoke, after about 5 minustes, you can floor it an=
 d
 nothing comes out.
 The car runs fine, but just shoots out smoke?! Is it the turbo??
 any help appreciated.. >>

Sam,
Is it possible that you just didn't notice it before the timing belt incident?
The car will not run as good when you first start it will when it's warmed up.
Period.  As a matter of fact.  I just installed an oil temperature gauge.
Even when the coolant lever warms to normal, the oil temperature hasn't.  So
you watch the oil pressure gauge at idle.  When the oil pressure starts
dropping at idle, the oil's warming up.  Try this out.  Go out and drive the
car around.  Watch the oil pressure.  See if it starts running better when the
oil pressure starts dropping at idle.

HOWEVER!!  My diagnosis is by my percieved episode.(man, that sounds like
Dameon Wayans on in living color!)  Anyway, I don't know what other potential
problems might be involved here (such as damage sustained to the valve guides
or somehting like that), so persue this further before just dropping it
because I say it sounds normal.
