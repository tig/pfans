What he is suggesting is probably a good idea.  I just had the same thing
done to my 87 944 with 75,000 miles on it.  Given that he already has the
car torn down to do the belt, it only makes sense to me to have him do the
other stuff also.  Avoid having to pay the tear-down labor again a little
down the road by having him do it all now.  Besides, better safe than sorry
with these cars.

Check your prices against his and see who can get it cheaper.  When I had
mine done, I was able to get some things cheaper but not all.  Of course,
his brother happens to work for the local dealer so he got a discount that
I couldn't beat.  As for seeing the actual parts, demand to see the damage
or potential problem from any person doing work on your vehicle.

Good luck,
