New list member and hopefully new Porsche owner...

I'm looking at purchasing an '88 924S I found one locally that has 60k
miles on it. I haven't had it checked out yet (in the works), but It
does have two problems. One is that it has some repaint on it, they did
a pretty good job (very good color match, didn't remove mirrors or door
handles) and a dash cap. It drives terrific (cranks kind of slow when
starting). The cruise control also doesn't work The body is very
straight (maybe two minor door dings) and I counldn't see any rust (not
much of a problem in texas). It has appartently had a timing belt at 53k
miles (good news).

Anything else I should look for?

The dealer has an initial asking price of $7,950 on it (due to low miles
mostly). I'm thinking more like $6,500. What sounds right to ya'll...
(central texas)
