Greg,

Thanks for the info on under/over steer.  I will play with tire
pressures.  I'm currently running Nitto 450's.  Good tire for the
street, and good in rain (orlando Florida), but I'm not so sure they
will be quite up for autocross or track use.  I'll do it anyway of
course, but we'll have to see how they perform.  They are considerably
better in the wet than the D40's they replaced, and probably just
slightly less dry stick.

On the way home tonight there was a stoplight after which two lanes
entered the onramp to I-4.  Both lanes continue all the way until
joining I-4.  There was a mustang GT beside me at the light and he
looked over and smiled, laughed actually.  My girlfried had noticed
this, and I didn't like it much.  Well, that onramp is a full 270 degree
right hander, me in the left and him in the right.  Natuarally, he left
the light and smoked me badly.  I didn't try very hard to horsepower
him, as it would have made me look bad, so I just accelerated briskly
and 100 yards later when that road started it's radius, I was smiling. 
I flashed my lights at him so that I knew he'd see me coming, and sure
enough his rear end dipped as he got on the gas.  The great thing about
this was that he was on the inside, it's much more humiliating when a
car goes by you on the outside of a corner.  Anyway, we all know what
happened next.  I blew by him at 70mph about half way through the
corner, easily 20 mph over his squealing, pathetic attempt at
cornering.  I was sure to give him a toot on the horn just to show that
I wasn't to worried about taking a hand off the wheel while embarrasing
his american made 'sportscar'  (yeah right).  As most of you know I spun
my car around a week or so ago in some corners, I had lost some
confidence and admit to being a bit nervous entering that corner so
fast, but kept saying "stay on the gas, no lift, no lift, no lifting the
damn throttle this time."  She stuck like glue, a little plowing, and
all four wheels drifted on the exit, but it was poetry in motion.  My
girlfriend, said "God, I love this car"  Yep, me too.  The mustang
caught up to me on I-4 a few miles later, my girlfriend laughed at him. 
He just kept going.  Humility is a wonderful thing isn't it? 
Baahahaaaaa!!  So when's that next autocross event anyway?  I can't
wait.

Bill
85.5 944  <--- just keep your foot on the gas and the front end stays in
front
