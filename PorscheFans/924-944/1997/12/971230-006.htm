Jon, I applaud your courage on the thought of rebuilding your turbo
motor. I have a few questions.

Why?...Is it running now, and if so, what type of problem are your
experiencing.  If it is smoking, is it rings, valve guides, seals, etc.

Many times, people think the worse because of a poor running engine,
when the real problewm is not as complex.  If you just want to rebuild
it anyway...wondeful...but if it is because of a problem...analyze it
first.  I do not know your level of mechanical ability, so I am not
trying to slam you at all, but if you do go into the motor, and don't
have the tools/experience/knowledge...be prepared to have problems. 
Bear in mind, that if mistakes are made in the rubuild process, they can
be just as costly (or more) the second time.  

One of the labor guides lists 47.2 hrs. to R&R and overhaul the engine,
plus machine work, and that is for an experienced mechanic.

A suggestion...find an experienced mechanic in your area who is willing
to walk you through some of the process and procedures, pitfalls and
positives.  I know of one particular friend who has had terrible
problems with his turbo motor. His smoking was diagnosed as being a ring
problem.  It actually was a valve guide problem, but the head was off I
think three times, and the problem was never fixed because of poor
workmanship.  This gentleman surely didn't mind paying to has his engine
repaired, but he wanted it done right the first time.  So I am saying to
you...do it, or have it done right the first time.

Another idea is to R&R the engine yourself and send it out to a
rebuilder.  We work with shops that don't have the total experience on
the Porsche engines, yet they do work on the cars, so they will pull
them out and send them to me for rebuilding, then I send them back.

Good luck to you and if I can be of further assistance, you can call me
direct at: Istook's
