Yep, I've used it, but not in my Porsches, yet.  I've also used Slick 50, 
but I personally believe this stuff is better.  I once had the opportunity 
to put a torch to a half-shaft castle nut on my '73 914 sprayed with the 
PROLONG Penetrant, and I couldn't get it to burn. The damn nut is torqued 
at 215+ ft lbs, and to say the least I was having trouble getting it off.  
I've used both the engine treatment, and the transmission treatment in my 
old '77 Lincoln Versaille (351 Windsor 87K miles). Believe me, it makes a 
difference in the way that engine and transmission runs.  I've also used 
the tranmission treatment in my '92 Dodge Caravan (100k+ miles).  The 
tranny was beginning to shift a little hard, so I added a bottle of the 
tranny treatment, and wala!, hard shifting gone.  I am planning to get 
more of this stuff to put in my '73 914 once the new engine is broken in.  
I'll probably go ahead and put the engine treatment in my '87 924S.  It's 
advertised that you can also put the tranny treatment in the manual 
transaxle, but I've not done that so I don't know what the results might 
be.

I've seen this stuff recently in a local speed shop here in Florida, and 
the price vs TV was the same, but you obviously don't pay shipping if you 
can find it.
