Hi Porsche owners,

I am not a mechanic nor a automobile expert at any level.  I do own a 84
944.  I bought the
car in 1995.  How was I to know how wonderful a car I was getting?  It
sure looked nice!
Anyway, I love this car!  It is more fun to drive then I can ever
explain in words.  Something
I would like to share.  Most of you already know this stuff.

I had a problem with the rear window defogger, no big deal, but it is
nice to have working.
I checked the element and it was fine.  I got a DVM and placed it on the
lead that comes through
the rear hatch shock.  While sitting in the front seat I would turn the
switch on and off while
looking at the meter through the back seat.  I could see it change (not
really caring what it read.  First
mistake!! )  So I was very perplexed as to what the heck was wrong.  I
tried to check the fuse
but as some of you already know the Haynes manual does NOT list the
fuses.  I guess
they think you should have your manual.  I have no manual.  Are they
listed there?
Anyway, I looked at all the fuses and they looked fine.  What to do
next?  Give up?  Well,  I almost did. 
Then, for some reason,  maybe something I read in the Haynes manual, I
noticed that
there are two, countem two fuse holder assembly's.  The other is a bit
hard to see.
I look up in it and see a fuse that is still good, but very discolored.
I take it out and I can see
it has a lot of corrosion.  I check the socket.  It also has a lot of
corrosion.  Seems the high
current draw allows this to happen.  Well I cleaned up the fuse and the
fuse holder and my
rear defogger works like a champ.
