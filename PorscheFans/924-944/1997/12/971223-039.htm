True, well, either a leakdown or (yes I did this once) pull the head,
remove the camshaft (to close all valves), flip upside down, and fill the
top of the compression chambers w/ water - if you see it dripping down
the ports, you've got a leak there! I used this once to check for
completeness on the re-grinding of a valve seat... 

However, what I'm talking about is the poor man's leakdown - you need
compressed air supply and hose to plumb this into the spark plug hole,
but you don't need a set of gauges to measure the leak, just your ears to
detect it. After all, we want there to be no leaks, and we're only
concerned on a very touchy-feely level as to how big they are - if your
rings are shot, do you really care whether you're losing 10 or 15 psi per
30 sec? You're facing a re-ring anyway...

If you're pushing air past the valve seats, it's not going to push it's way
past the valve stems and seals - it'll go to the lowest pressure area,
which will either be the tailpipe or the airbox. The seals are only between
the ports and the camshaft area. You can listen for leakage at the rings
simply by removing the oil filler cap, since that's vented to the crankcase.

Just to clarify/recap what we're talking about here, the procedure would
be: rotate engine to TDC for the cylinder in question, pressurize the
cylinder with compressed air using an adapter hose (and hold the
pressure steady, hooked up to the supply), then listen (for hissing) at the
oil filler cap, airbox/engine intake, and the tailpipe. Hissing at the oil filler
cap indicates worn rings, at the intake indicates poor seating on that
intake valve(s, for you 16V people), and hissing at the tailpipe indicates
poor seating on the exhaust valve(s) on that cylinder. This makes for a
quick and inexpensive way to assess an engine's situation...

A leakdown test is preferable to this in that it will tell you just how bad
the leaks are (though you will still need to determine where they are).

....onward and upward...
