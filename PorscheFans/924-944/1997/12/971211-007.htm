Regarding the hints, do you mean the 968 gear box and 944S cams? If so, do
the S cams differ from the S2? Porsche rates the S hp/liter output a little
higher than the S2, and the S is apparently a better top-end performer.  I
was wondering if the cam profiles had anything to do with this.

Count me in. I promise not to tell.  I also agree that the S2 can hold its
own on the track in stock form against a 968. My driving skills leave
something to be desired, but even on long straights, where all you have to
do is stand on the throttle, the S2 doesn't seem to lose too much ground to
the 968. Nonetheless, more power would be nice.
