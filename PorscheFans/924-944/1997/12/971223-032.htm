Sounds logical to me, Vaughan.  Assuming even if a cylinder was pressurized
off TDC, and you were forcing air past the guides or seals, where would you
listen for it? 

What happens if you're forcing air into the crankcase, either past the
rings or valve stems? Would any make it into the crankcase ventilation
system?  If so, then pressurization at TDC might result in the sound of air
flow at the air filter box (or wherever it vents), even if there were no
sound in the intake manifold.  

The bottom line I'm getting is a leakdown can only tell you whether the
seating of your intake or exhaust valves are bad.
