Steve,
  I live in Orlando with a siezed A/C compressor, so I know what you are 
going though. First, the A/C relay is a specialized relay that cannot be 
bought at a regular parts store. It contains diodes inside that help route 
and control the flow of current. If you want to replace it, PORSCHE is the 
place to go, or a specialty supplier that sells the same. 
  As for a short circuit, try this: With the A/C fuse and relay removed, 
clamp on a DVM to the positive side of the clutch wire. Put the other side 
of your DVM to ground. Set it up with wires long enough to reach inside your 
car. Set the DVM for OHMS (lowest setting). Take a passenger with you on a 
drive (to watch the DVM while you watch the road). If there is a short in 
this part of the circuit, the DVM should show it while you drive. If no 
short shows up, try the same thing for other parts of the circuit before the 
relay and fuse till you find the leg it is on. The HAYES manual for the 944 
has a pretty good electrical drawing in the back that shows the A/C 
circuitry. It does have some things (potential errors) that might be 
different for your car, so don't treat it as a Bible. When you find the leg 
with the problem, eliminate (unplug) all components that are a part of that 
leg to make sure nothing but the wire remains, and remeasure. This will take 
some time, but could save you a ton of money at the dealer's shop letting 
him do the same. Some might argue with my methods, but I am a professional 
electronics technician for a living. I analize equipment (and MY 944) like 
this all the time, and always "get my man." Good luck, and write me back 
directly with and questions.
