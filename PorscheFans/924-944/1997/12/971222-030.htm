I just replaced mine with Boge gas inserts. I think their good. Not
real costly...$75 each. I'm sure their not as stiff as Koni or Bilstein
but for daily driving there fine...maybe not FINE, but good enough. I
would like a little stiffer but I'm not going to spend 400 bucks for
it. If I was going to be a-x'ing I would probably replace with stiffer
springs and shocks.
