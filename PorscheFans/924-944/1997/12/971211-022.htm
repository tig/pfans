A few days ago I started a thread about the entrenched oil cooled prejudice
I have noticed among porsche people. Today I got a flyer for Carlsen
Porshce in the bay area, advertising christmas gift ideas for the Porsche
fan. It had t-shirts, doo dads, and an extensive collection of die cast
models. Out of the 60 or 70 different models including every 911 ever, some
356's, factory race cars, and even 914's, there were exactly 0 waterpumper
cars represented. No t-shirts, no models, no coffee cups, no books. I dont
know why this bothers me so much, but it does. I have 5 freinds with
waterpumpers and it would have been nice to get them some related products.
It's getting hard to find anything related to our cars anymore. I'm going
to have to blow off a 911 on the way home just to make myself feel better.
Enough venting, back to work.
