The 924/944 was never intended to be the 'entry level'  Porsche,
something the factory has tried to get away from, from day 1.  It was,
however, intended to be the cornerstone of Porsche production, and
ensure the companies survival as an independent manufacturer (a 'mass
market' Porsche, is there is such a thing), in addition to this, the
intention was to produce a more powerful and better handling car to lure
customers away from the Japanese sports cars (RX-7, etc) that were
making inroads into the 924's sales figures.  This it did admirably.

On the subject of V6 engines, the factory actually ran a Renault derived
V6 engine 
in a pre-production prototype of the 944, (a 924 development and
previous to this the
original factory test bed, an Opel Kadett, if memory serves me correct.
This Opel was used to develop the transaxle for the 924/944), for a
while before development of the 4 cyl.engine began.

The 4 cyl. was finally chosen to ease assembly, as a V6 would have had
to have
been dropped into the body from above, thus requiring alteration of the
existing 
924 production line, where the bodies were dropped onto the engines.
(i.e. A 
reversal of the existing production line process.)

Contrary to popular belief, the 4 cyl. is not just half a 928 V8, though
it does share a few common components, and as a footnote, the new 2.5l 4
cyl. balance shafted 944 engine was smoother than the original Renault
V6 tried earlier.

Just my two penneth. (Or should that be two cents worth ?)

Regards, and a Happy New Year to all Porsche fans.
