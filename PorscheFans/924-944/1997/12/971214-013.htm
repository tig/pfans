Pfans!

        Excitement reigns supreme!!!! About six weeks ago I posted about a
1988 Turbo S with 43500 miles that I had seen that I offered 7500 for
(asking price 9900). I was told to get bent. In the interim I have started
to hanker to do some driver's ed etc. and was looking at upgrading my
suspension on my S2. Very expensive stuff. Just for yukks I called the
dealer to see what had happened to the Turbo S. He explained that the owner
had become more realistic and that I could buy the car for 8000. Bingo!!
It's in my garage today. As I look at it and see it as a track car the paint
that I thought needed replacement will probably look very satisfactory with
a cut and buff. Our local leather medic can probably make the cracked dash
presentable and so what I need now is a good maintenance (belts, etc) new
tires (it has virtually new Comp Ta's but they are M+S- anybody up north
need them?) and a few minor fixes (driver's sun visor, locking lug nuts, P
emblem, leather shift boot and new hinge for cassette box).

        One problem I have is some water in the left rear wheel well. In
drying it out I noticed a 1.5 inch diameter plug laying in the bottom. I
replaced this. Also there is a yellowish tube which exits through a hole
near the bottom of the well. Where this tube passes I would have thought
there would be a grommet or some caulking compound (the sailor speaks) and
there is none. Could water be coming in here? There was also water in the
tailight and we drilled a couple of small holes in the lenses to let the
water out. I don't think the hatch is leaking. I also noticed that the hole
in the hatch for the rear windshield wiper is smaller than the one in  the
hatch of my S2. Why was this change made? TIA

My wife wants to know how many Porsches it would take to make me happy. I
have a 1987 Targa that I am trying to sell.
