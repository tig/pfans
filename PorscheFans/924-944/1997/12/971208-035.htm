I did not see my last posting appear on the list, so I am posting it again. 
 
--------
My '88 944 is a great car to drive is a lot of fun.  I picked it up in Feb. 
in Allentown, PA and since then I have not seen another one like it for the 
Price/mileage  combination (49K;$9000).  Well my question is about the dash 
lights being dim.  Although I could not see how bright they were when I 
bought the car during the day light, in the night I found they were dim 
even at the max position of the dimmer switch.  I have taken the dash apart 
and all the lights are working; the dimmer switch also indicate a zero 
resistance at its max position and I don't know where next to look.  I know 
there was an after market alarm put in the car and I am wondering, if it is 
contributing to the dim lights by taking away power.  The dim dash is 
annoying more than anything else and certainly does not take away from the 
pleasure of driving.  Any help would be appreciated.

Also:  the AC is not working and I have been told it is the condenser which 
has a leak.  Any recommendations for a good place/price for a condenser.  
I will be coming up for new rotors for the front; information of a good 
source for these would be appreciated.  

My final question has to do with hard driving.  I notice a 'rotton egg' 
type of smell when I drive the car 'hard'.  I was wondering someone else 
has had a similar experience or could advise me as to what it may be coming 
from.

Dear all,
     I have a '93 968 w/ 28k miles and just saw an ad from Automotion for
their performance chip.  Does anyone have experience w/ it, and what's the
performance improvement vs. the risk of potential damage?  Would appreciate
hearing from all.
