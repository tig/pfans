incorrect
installation, you should have no more problems with premature belt
failure.

Hi Clark,

What you say makes a lot of sense although I don't beleive Porsche
recommends the 3 years or 30000 miles interval.  I also received a few
private replies from fellow 968 owners experiencing premature balance
shaft belt failures.  I guess the consensus is to change it every 3
years or 30000 miles and re-tension it at least once a year.  I looked
at the maintenance records from the previous owner and the belts were
re-tensioned only once at 2500 miles.  Thanks for all the responses.  I
feel a lot better now that I know I did not have a unique failure.

Thanks,
Alex Chiu
