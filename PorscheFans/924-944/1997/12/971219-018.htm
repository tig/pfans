I'm well versed with passenger side footwell leak, but this year's rainy
season has thrown me a suprise.  When the car is sitting in the rain
there is a constant drip that falls just between the clutch and brake
pedals.  When I look up under the dash I can't see a damn thing.  It's
like a magic trick or something.  I assume it is running in along some
shaft or bundle, but I can't find anything.  The clutch shaft has a
little moisture on it but I can't tell if that is it.  Any ideas?  Is
there some standard leak on this side?  Could it be the windshield
gasket?  How wouls I best seal any leak if I do find it?  Silicon caulk
would be my first guess, but I'm usually wrong.

While I was under there I noticed that the clutch pedal spring shaft
(made that name up myself) has a hole in the end of it.  It looks like
it is meant for a cotter pin or something to keep the pedal from
bottoming out on the floor (like mine does).  Is this true and if so
what kind of pin do I put through the hole?  I can't find it in my parts
book (but I got microfiches coming for christmas).

Thanks and happy holidays,
