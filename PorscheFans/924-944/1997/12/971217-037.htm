Hi!
=20
First, I would like to thank everyone for their help on the clutch for =
my 924S.  This list is great! =20
=20
Got the clutch in this weekend and cannot remember (the memory is the =
second thing to go!) which way the pin on the shift lever (on the =
console) goes.  Does the open side of the pin (the end with the clip) =
face the driver's side or the passenger's side?  Are there washers on =
either side?  Having some problem catching 1st and second gears.
=20
Also, noticed what appears and sounds like a crack in the manifold.  =
Anyone know if this is one of the items covered by Porsche warranty?  =
Any suggestions on fixes.
=20
I would be happy to provide any clutch info before the rest of the =
memory goes.  BTW, cost was about $425.
