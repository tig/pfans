Hi from a wet, cold and miserable Holland.

I have a 1986 or 87 German spec 924S (924 body, 944 mechanicals). It?s my
first Porsche and a relatively recent acquisition, so I am on a fairly
steep learning curve (the joys, and costs, of having a semi-exotic car).

At some time in the last few years, the car has had a new or reconditioned
engine. At the same time, *all* ancilliary components in the engine bay
were replaced. I don?t know why, but I guess that it had had a big(ish)
engine fire.

Since it is our ?family hatchback?, my main interest is in keeping it
running as reliably as possible - but without having to pay Porsche dealer
servicing prices!

Hence my asking a few questions here ...

1 A couple of weeks ago, the heated rear screen packed up. The little light
on the switch still works but there is no power at the connection to the
hatch. I have no wiring diagramme for the car, but no fuses appear to be
blown. Any thoughts.

2 Shortly after that failure, the windscreen washer pump also failed.
Nothing happens at all, no whirring or noises of any sort. As yet, I
haven?t checked for power at the pump, though.

3 On a completely different matter, the heater seems very erratic. It takes
an age for any warm air to start coming - the engine temperature guage has
to be on the 3/4 mark (last before the red zone) before I get anything at
all. Then it?s only a few minutes to near-tropical conditions inside the
car. If the heater control is turned below 3/4 fully-on, it?s back to cold
air again.

4 Related to this, switching the heater fan on to full causes the enginge
temperature guage to jump about half a mark! So, with the fan full on, the
engine always appears to be running hot.

5 The oil pressure guage is all over the place, the needle thrashing around
like snake on acid. Because of this it?s hard to establish an accurate
reading, but it seems to be:-
Cold -         4.5 to 5 bar at idle (or pegged out if the outside temp is
below 5 celsius)
          Pegged out at 2500 rpm or over

Warm -    1.5 to 2 bar at idle (slightly less if the engine is very hot)
          4 to 5 bar at 2500 rpm or over
Are these values okay/acceptable?

Sorry if this has been a bit long, I?ll try to keep my questions short in
future. However, any advice on these or other 924S matters would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Matthew.
