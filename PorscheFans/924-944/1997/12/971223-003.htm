To Paul Foster,
           Last Saturday I posted a list of changes that could be made
to the normally aspirated 924S -944 to enhance performance. The whole
idea for this posting grew out of a joke that was posted by another
member of the list earlier in the week. At the time, I found it rather
funny that some people were responding seriously to information that was
so obviously flawed. Because the response to the false information was
so heavy, I thought it only fair to post some genuine tips for anyone
that was interested. The information I provided was never intended to
help anyone cheat at a racing event. I do not enter my car in
competition and do not intend to. The information was intended for those
who get  enjoyment out of learning a little bit about their car and how
to possibly make it a little more fun to drive. If you find the
description of these modifcations assists you in catching people that
are competeing unfairly at your events, then I am only to happy to be of
help to you to.
