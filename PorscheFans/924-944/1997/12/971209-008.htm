Will, this is a long shot but I had a similar problem with my 924 Turbo.
After replacing the master cylinder and slave cylinder with no real effect
( I had some rust in my master cylinder also which prevented the pedal from
coming right up , until sometimes it would clonk against the stop long
after I had taken my foot off the clutch), I gave up and gave it to a(good
Swiss Merc specialist) mechanic.

He found that the flexible rubber hose between master & slave cylinder had
closed up totally inside over time. The way to check is have the car on a
hoist and have someone underneath who releases the bleed screw while
someone has their foot on the pedal. if the clutch disengages immediately
then it may be the problem. Hope this helps!
