Well, 

All the software in the world was working on that one. A RACE-prepped S2
can do 345hp. But that pales next to the 945. No mistake there, the
945.And it was a turbo, no less. 

See, Audi was pissed because the 924-944 they passed on was so
successful. So they bought one and stuck a 20-valve Audi Rally engine in
it. Dr. Piech had a ball blowing off 951 owners with it. A simple
installation. Dr. Piech won a 500DM bet from one of his relatives over
this. So they wouldn't sell him bodies to let Audi have a real sports
car. 

Some stats:   	0-100km 5.2sec
		0-200km 27sec
		338Hp
 		2874pounds

Don't forget, Audi also built a 914/5 to try that. This development
usually happens during long, cold winters with lots of Spaatzle on hand.
