Barry,
  I agree with you on the recommendation for Tom to replace his
belts. I know I would sleep a lot better replacing 9 year old
belts. But, if it is so cost effective to replace the belts vs
just an inspection don't you think we would be recommended to
replace every 15k? 
  I'm not familiar with the 951 but I think there must be more
than a 35$ difference b/w inspecting and replacing. On my NA
replacement including rollers is over $400. I have been quoted
~120 for inspection.
  Sorry if this has already been covered, I'm catching up.

i doc
84 944    "I like it, I love it, I want some more of it..."  
guess that means I want a 951?
