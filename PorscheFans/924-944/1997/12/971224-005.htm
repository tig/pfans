I too have found the airflow pretty pathetic in the 924: I can use it
defrosting successfully, but I live in Virginia, so that's no big
accomplishment! I have noticed two items which may help on this: 1) my
fan often (but not always) seems to run even when turned off. 2) when
I was messing with the radio, I has a problem with a bad ground in the
console, resulting in the fan running full blast regardless of control
setting. 

This leads me to believe (sorry, didn't have a voltmeter at the time) that
the whole metal part of the fan control is "hot" (+12V or therabouts). This
fact, coupled with first-hand evidence that the plate is disgustingly dirty,
leads me to believe that some improvement could possibly be had by
going in and cleaning and re-lubing all of that. I also hope to someday pull
my dash to recover it, and would like to pull out the heater unit and clean
and re-lube everything (the fan's squaking a little bit). Coming from British
cars, I've found that an amazing number of problems can be fixed or
avoided by a proper cleaning and lubrication...

I do get the sense that I'm getting a little more airflow than you guys are,
so it does seem like there's room for improvement, that this isn't
something we should just have to suffer through...
