I remember a line of discussion concerning installing a new Tape/CD player
by someone and their AM section not working due to the Antenna amp not
being powered/plugged in or something of the sort.   

If someone remembers the date of the posting or better yet has expirenced
the same issue please drop me a line.   
I've replaced the Reno 2 in my 90 S2 and everything works great with the
exception of the AM band on the radio.

TIA

P-fans:

When I first bought my 92 968 coupe, I took off the gas cap for the first
fillup and noticed it weighed about a half a pound.  I had never seen such an
impressive gas cap before (my Japanese cars always have flimsy plastic ones),
but it seemed REALLY heavy.  I didn't think any more of it until recently when
I went to my Porsche mechanic who was installing an Autopower roll bar in my
968 cab.  He had to remove the rear storage compartments/parcel shelf assembly
as well as some plastic rear trim panels.  He put the parcel shelf piece into
my truck, but when I lifted it out at home I realized it weighed a ton!
(actually about 21 pounds on the scale).  I turned it over to take a good
look, and found that the structure was based on thick pieces of plywood with
carpeting and plastic parts attached.  The workmanship was OK, but PLYWOOD?  I
didn't think I bought a Morgan.  Yeah, I know, the new Corvette uses balsa
wood in the floorboards, but at least that is light.  I think this same piece
made out of aluminum or even mild steel would have weighed less than half as
much.  Why would Porsche do this?  I suspect that, with attention to detail,
Porsche could have saved several hundred pounds on each of my 968s without any
sacrifice in durability.  Or am I wrong here?

Now I guess I can skip my post-holiday diet since my cars are so fat, anyway!
Or maybe I should lose weight to make up for them?
