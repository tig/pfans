I have cookie cutters on my 1985 944. I am slowly cleaning them up but they
are never going to look great. There are advertisements for teledial wheels
(7 x 15) in Porscheworld at reasonable prices. Will any year model wheels
fit or are there some that won't fit due to different offset etc.?
Apologies for asking a question that appears to have been asked before.

TIA

Alyn

944:  geometry adjusted, worth every penny (cent).
Stelmac Garage Ltd, Shaftesbury, Dorset, excellent service, ask for Chris,
who even phoned me the next day to see what I thought about the adjustments
he had made. Due to new f. shocks and track rod ends the geometry had some
positive camber and was out of spec. everywhere, and I have a pretty
computer print out to keep.
