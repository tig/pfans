Puhleeze let us read any response you get back, although I have a feeling
that your name will quietly be dropped from their mailing list...shame. On
second thought they'll probably respond, how satisfactorily will be very
interesting to see.

Wanted to pass on info regarding a very satisfying experience....

Just upgraded the wheels and tires on my 87 944S.  Contacted several wheel
sources and ended up purchasing from Wheel Enhancement in Culver City, CA.

They recommended a set of 993 wheels.  7 x 16 front, and 9 x 16 rear.
Mounting required the recommended 1" spacers.  The wheels were take offs with
less than 100 miles.  They are perfect, and they look outstanding!!!!

The guys at Wheel Enhancement definitely know their Porsche wheel
applications.

Check out their info at http://www.wheelenhancement.com.  You'll note that one
of the owners is Robert Wood.  He's the original founder of Robert W. Wood,
Inc. which he owned from 1977 to 1992.  Now he owns Wheel Enhancement...

By the way...  I also contact Robert W. Wood, Inc., and was disappointed in
the advice and pricing presented.

Definitely give Wheel Enhancement a shot if you're looking for wheels.
