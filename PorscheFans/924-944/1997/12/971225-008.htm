I went to see why my rear window wasn't defogging the other day and found
out that the wire was rotted almost totally through.  (About one or two
pieces still holding together, but not enough to carry much current at
all.)  I have a temporary wire hooked up there, but I wasn't able to
splice it to the connector at all and had to just electrical-tape it to
the plug.  Aside from worries about it falling off when I hit a bump
someday, it also doesn't defrost well - just well enough for me to drive. 
The dealer doesn't seem to carry the original part.  Anybody got one or
know a workaround?

It takes about five minutes for the wires to "warm up" enough to start
showing the lines, and about fifteen minutes before there aren't any gaps.
 I've taken to driving the car around with the defroster on all the time,
'cause by the time I notice the window fogging up, it's too late to do
anything about it.
