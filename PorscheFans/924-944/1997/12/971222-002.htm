Mine did the same thing.  I pulled the bolts of of either end and pulled 
the whole contraption off.  I put it into a vice to gain leverage and 
free the bolts.  One side is reverse threaded and I think that causes 
some grief.

It seems people tighten those nuts way too much.  You are not holding a 
wheel on the car.

I put anti-seize on my threads and snugged the bolts tight, but did not 
wrench them like a gorilla.  They hold just fine.
