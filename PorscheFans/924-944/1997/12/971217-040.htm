I am not sure that you have made your point clearly and I do not know who 
you are quoting, but such conversions are not something for everybody.  
You have to look at what the end user wants.

If you want a project car that will be fun (assuming this is one's idea 
of fun), then this might be your ticket.  You will easily get a good 
education and spend lots of time in your garage (I like my garage time).

If, on the other hand, you are searching more more power, for power's 
sake, you can probably do better finding another car.  If you are looking 
at keeping a 944 variant in your garage, the Turbo or Turbo S will be a 
hands down winner when it comes time to show the money.  Such cars can be 
bought from $7,000 and up depending, on condition.  Turbos are easy to 
modify for additional horse power and already have the upgraded brakes 
and suspension that higher horse power demands.  After market 
modifications are more easily accepted by potential buyers should you 
sell later.

Hybrid conversions can not offer the seamless function that a stock 
factory car does.  Insurance can be a nightmare if you have to collect 
for damages.  You had better make a point to have the car insured for 
true value.  Yes, insurance companies will do it, but you pay extra for 
such coverage.

There are many things that require compromise and you are only fooling 
yourself if you think that you can resell your car at a future date 
without penalty.  Once you modify your vehicle by transplanting another 
engine that is not designed for that vehicle you automatically limit the 
resale market for your car.  Even if you are able to find someone that is 
willing to pay equivalent price, and it is true that a sucker is born 
every minute, there are 100 times as many people willing to buy an 
unmolested vehicle of same vintage.  This is called ease of sale.  I know 
when I want to sell a vehicle I want to unload it in as short a time as 
possible with as few people fussing over it as possible.  I just have 
better things to do than entertain strangers and curiosity seekers.

I do not make such statements idly.  I have purchased, in my past, a 
hybrid pick up truck from a guy that built one.  I bought it for less 
than he had in it, sold it for even less when I needed a different 
vehicle.  I confess that it was a fun toy that turned many heads and was 
a good conversion, but I never found any curiosity seekers willing to put 
the bucks down when I wanted to unload it.

If you want a toy and like to turn wrenches and heads, hybrids can be a 
great hobby.  If you want a dependable car that goes fast, can be driven 
daily, and is predictable, think stock.
