Hi Porschefans

I've been reading this list for a long time, but have seldom posted. It's
amazing how many well informed members post regularly. Thanks.
I have had an 83 944 for nearly four years now. Got it with 88K and the four
banger now has 146K. It has had A LOT done to it, but I must say, overall, has
been a GREAT car.

I'm curious about maintaining the performance ability of this car at its peak.
I understand that these engines are longer-living than the air cooled, but to
be honest, I have yet to push the car to its limit. Sure, I've cruised at 110
mph regularly, but I'm afraid something will give if I push it more.
The car is a beautiful anthracite gray, which in my opinion is the only true
Porsche color. Among the things I have had done to it have been 2 clutches, 2
timing belts, one roller kit, head cover gasket, brake pads, 2 exhausts, 1
catalytic converter, etc., etc.

My question goes to other "first US series" 944 owners. What have you done to
keep your cars on the road, and how far do you push them. Oh, on high mileage
cars of this series, a cracked firewall around the clutch master cylinder is a
fairly common fault which REALLY cost me to fix.

Your faithful early 944 enthusiast,

Luis
