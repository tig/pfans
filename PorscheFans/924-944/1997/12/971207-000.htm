<< Ok, I'm a dumb ass at times, as far as insurance and angles of approach, is
 there something
 I should do to minimize my losses from this incident?  Any pointers would be 
 valuable because
 I have never wrecked a car and I dont really know what kind of things 
 insurance might try to do.
 
 Thanks in advance. . .

You need to contact the PCA valuation committee (or something like that, I
can't remember the exact title).  They will give you some leverage.  Also use
Panorama and Excellence Classifieds. 

Good luck.

 replace me bumper. I want to get a bumper with ground effects.  Who has these
 that look good? How much are they? >>

I don't think you can get any better than a stock turbo rear.  Unless you put
a 968 rear on it.  That would look pretty freaky.
