Hello Fans,

Just would like to learn more about my '87 944 NA.
Could someone please explain how the charging
system works in the 944? 

I've noticed that when I start the car, the battery
voltage indicator is around the 10-12 volt reading.  As
soon as the tach hits 2500 rpm, the battery voltage
indicator increases just below the 14V mark and stays
there for the entire time the car is running.  Naturally
makes sense because I'm sure the alternator is
supplying power and maintaining trickle on the battery.
In contrast, as soon as I crank my Ford Explorer, the
battery voltage goes straight to the Normal mark
around 14V and stays there regardless.

It's been a characteristic of the car since I bought it so
I believe there is nothing wrong.  I know that the 944
alternator doesn't put out a whole lot of power when
idle so what happens after it reaches 2500rpm? 

Just curious.

P.S.

Dave Cherry, 

I have the manuals and removing the radiator doesn't
appear to be all that difficult.   I've never done it so I'm
far from an expert (only needed to get as far as
removing the cooling fan assembly to get to the
thermofan switch), but if you would like to borrow the
manuals (you live in the DC Metro area, right?) , I'd be
more than happy to lend them to you and even
wouldn't mind giving you a hand if you need help. 
E-mail me directly at <karlnoah@oscsystems.com>
