I agree totally with Frank Renna on this one.  Also, think about the 
fluids.  Anything that has oil, water, brake fluid, gasoline, etc., 
should be immediately flushed and replaced.  I would not use synthetic 
oil in the engine as the seals will leak like a submarine with screen 
windows, unless that is what has always been in the engine.

Although the low mileage on any car is a tempting buy, do not forget that 
a correctly maintained Porsche with average miles will run a long, long 
time.  Quite probably, longer than you would keep it.  Porsches like to 
be run on a regular basis.

As a comparison, I have a low mileage 944S that has the same set of 
problems as any other average mileage car, albeit maybe not as intense.  
I am still looking at costly repairs like the clutch, AC clutch, leaky 
pan gasket (car sat for one year without driving), and a host of other 
gremlins that are not too serious.  All are failing before their time.  
Still, it is a nice car and looks brand new, and I like it.  I paid a 
premium, but in this case the car was fully loaded with all available 
options and the paint was near flawless.  This offset the extra cost, so 
I felt this car was fairly priced.

I would not recommend an older low mileage car if you must pay a large 
premium.  Low mileage cars have little value over a correctly maintained 
car, unless it is a special collectors car and is not to be used as a 
regular driver.

There are a lot of costs associated with cars that spend a lot of time in 
storage.  Tires dry rot, and so too, fuel hoses and other rubbery 
components.
