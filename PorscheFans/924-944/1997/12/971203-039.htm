David, and list:

There were several types of CV joints used in 924, 94 and 951 cars.  For the
Turbos, there were at least two types, with a changeover occuring in the 1987
model year.  My '87 car had the earlier style.  I have replaced them with the
later style, which necessitated the purchase of two used halfshafts from a
wrecked Turbo S at Partsheaven.  The halfshafts were required due to the
different spline pattern of the later joints.

Anyway, I have about two dozen assorted brand new CV bolts.  These have come
in various joint/boot kits I have bought during the last few years.  There
are 2-3 different bolt lengths, but they are all around 40 - 45mm.  Just
today I finished safety wiring the outer bolts.  The inner bolts were wired
last week, and survived a full day at Laguna (two drivers) on Friday, and
Thunderhill on Sunday (during the Club Race weekend).

By the way, some porsche cars use CV joint gaskets, although I don't think
that any 924/944/951 cars do.  There are also some special ribbed and dished
lock washers that some of the cars call for.  I used some of these in
addition to the mild Loctitie and the safety wire.  I don't want to mess with
CV joints again until midseason next year.

I have factory S style wheels from a 944 Turbo, good condition, appear to be 7
& 9 x 16. $550 for all 4 without tires, will help with shipping.

Thanks,
