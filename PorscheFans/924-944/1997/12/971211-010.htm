The consensus of the service managers at my local Porsche dealer, and the
owner of the local Porsche performance shop is to replace the timing and
balance shaft belts on a 968 at 30K miles or two years, whichever comes
first.  The manual says 60K miles.  When dropping my car off for the 30K
service at the Porsche dealer, they said the belts were fine.  Several hours
later they called and said the Porsche service bulletins advised 30K or two
year replacement.  The dealer seemed more concerned about the age of my
belts (3 years) than the mileage.  The belts looked fine on inspection (no
cracks or signs of unusual wear).

..... and they were quiet both after the initial installation and later after
the 1.8K mile retentioning/check.  Love that hydraulic tensioner..
