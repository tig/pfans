I started this thread with a story about me losing control on a set of
twisties one night and doing a nice 40 yard slide down the pavement.  I
must admit, I lost some confidence in my ability to drive this car that
night, and haven't pushed it nearly as hard since.  Not even in my
favorite group of corners, which I know like the back of my hand.  I
have a thought, and would like to bounce it off the racer-boy
collective.  Ok, here's a 944.  Typically a car that pushes the front
end when at it's limit, but one day it tosses the rear end instead. 
Like some others on this list, I'm never one to leave well enough alone,
so when I changed my tires a few months ago I went to 225/50/15's all
the way around.  So, I'm putting more rubber on the road up
front.....that should make the front end stick better in corners, no? 
Would that not cause an oversteer when at the limits because the front
end won't slide?  Just a thought.

Also, I'm going to change my clutch next week.  I'm going to be auto
crossing the car, and a DE or two.  I'm leaning towards a spring
centered clutch, as I'll be abusing it a bit I'm sure.  Anyone disagree
with that?  I've owned this car for 7K miles and on occasion it will
grind a 'little' going into second.  Can I assume that since the rubber
center was going bad (let go last week) that there was rubber pieces
getting in there once in a while, or should I change synchro's while
it's all out of the car?  Any input would be appreciated.
