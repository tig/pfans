This reply didn't make it to the list the first time, and I couldn't
resist.

Hey Marvin,

    WOW, I'm continually amazed how passionate/arrogant some Porsche 
owners are about some subjects.  I really appreciate your feedback on my 
oil additives testimony; however, your criticism of my reply as not being 
a "scientific sample" is a crock as far as I'm concerned. Besides, the guy 
who posted the original question didn't ask if anybody had done a 
scientific statistical analysis of oil additives lately, he asked if 
anybody had any experience or an opinion.  If everyone who posted an 
opinion on this page had to have scientific proof that what they were 
saying was absolute undisputable fact, rather than their opinion, 
experience or what they've read somewhere, then it wouldn't exist. 
    I've not yet used PROLONG in either of my Porsches, but I can tell you 
that from ACTUAL EXPERIENCE in my other cars it has made a noticeable 
difference in both mileage and performance no matter what the OIL 
COMPANIES (who are competing for the same business by the way) or our 
GOVERNMENT or the PCNA have to say about 'em. Jeez, we'd better hope some 
government anti-fossil-fuel-burning-rides-the-METRO-everyday bureaucrat 
that doesn't have a "Porsh" never sees this conversation; otherwise, we 
could have another paranoid PROLONG'd Phen/Phen ban on our hands.
   I happen to run nothing but CASTROL in both of my Porsches. Yes I have 
two, a '73 914 and an '87 924S, oooh... I bet you didn't think WATER and 
OIL mixed.  Think of how jealous those cars must be of each other.  I've 
been running both Slick 50 and PROLONG in two of my no-status-non-PORSCHE 
cars for more than three years (one has over 100k and the other about 90K 
miles), and I can say emphatically that I've had nothing but POSITIVE 
RESULTS, including NO CATALYTIC CONVERTER PROBLEMS.  Three years is a 
pretty good test wouldn't you say?  If Porsche says don't use it in their 
engines for a good reason, then I probably wouldn't, except maybe in the 
teener(a 914 to you watercooled diehards - NOH20 and NOCAT).  But Marvin, 
if you'd done your scientific research before hammering my opinion, you'd 
found that PROGLONG "..Does not contain plastic particles, PTFE resins 
(Teflon), graphite, molybdenum disulfide, or any other solids, which may 
cause harmful buildup..." as stated on the PROLONG site at 
http://ww03.imall.com/stores/prolong/.  They also have their case studies 
on each of their products documented there.
   Let me know if you happen to ever discover an open mind and get curious 
on your own, and maybe, just maybe question what the competing OIL COMPANY 
SCIENTISTS (or any trustworthy government agency - if you can find one) or 
the PCNA have to say, you might give PROLONG a try in a 
no-status-non-PORSCHE car.  Or, better yet, sneak it into someone else's 
car, and hide in the bushes and watch.  
   In case you're wondering, here's what really pissed me off. Since you 
hinted that I might be a dishonest person (my guess is because I don't to 
appear to be a purist), I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER TO BE HONEST IF I EVER DECIDE 
TO SELL.  I'm tying a ribbon around my finger right now so I'll make sure 
and remember....  Guess which finger....

Happy Holidays to everyone else on the list...

Once there was a man who went to his neighbor's house to borrow an ax.
His neighbor said, "I'm  very sorry but you cannot borrow my ax because 
I'm using it to make soup."  The perplexed man asked his neighbor, "What 
does an ax have to do with making soup?".  His neighbor replied, "Nothing, 
but if I don't want you to borrow my ax, any excuse is as good as 
another".
