Produced 92-95.  I think about 4000 total imported to the US, half coupes
and half convertibles. 
 I have a coupe with the Tiptronic transmission.  It is really great.  We
bought it for my wife although it's mostly me that drives it now.  (She's
currently in love with her new (old) M-B 190D 2.5.  What a woman.  35-40
mpg.)  The four speed Tiptronic really teams nicely with the 968 engine,
IMHO.  The fancy Variocam 4 valve tuned intake system provides a broad
torque band in each gear and the slush pump gives added punch pulling away
from stoplights.  I usually shift it manually except when in city traffic
or on the Interstate.  We don't compete with it, although it has some
features (such as pre-downshifting when approaching slow corners at high
speed) that are touted.   
 We have had ours about two years. The only problem so far has been with
the ignition switch.  for a while it was reluctant to move from the wheel
unlock position to the dash lights on position.  After much DIY messing
around with it (and the interlock adjustment to the transmission) it
finally cured itself.  I think it just needed  lubrication.  Tires wear out
rapidly.  I am currently running RE-71s (225/45-17 and 255/40-17) and it
seems 8000 on the rear, l4000 on the front is about it.  If I were to buy
another 968 coupe I would closely inspect the hatch glass/hinge area.  Mine
has  some separation.  This is a weak area in the 944 type cars and I think
it may be worse  in the 968 because the new spoiler design feels heavier
(at least compared to my 924S).  The hatch was hard to close before I
adjusted the latch pins.  I suspect the PO had been slamming it down to get
it closed.
