I'm the new owner of an '88 924S... What catalogs and books are must
haves for replacement parts, accessories and knowledge?

Does anyone make a nice looking subtle airdam for the front of a 924S?
the metal valance panel is kind of banged up from the dpo running it
over curbs.  It doesn't look horrible, but I'd still like to hide it.

Also, where is a good place for replacement carpet. My interior is the
almost white color (linen?) and the dpo replaced the rear carpet (just
the bottom piece) with a black piece. I would also like to replace the
front floor mats with lighter colored ones instead of the black ones
that are in it.

Oh yeah, one more thing. The car has a pretty cheap dash cap on it that
wasn't installed very well. I was thinking of just covering it with one
of those dash carpets. Any suggestions on a good place to get that? I
was also thinking about replacing the dash cap with a higher quality
one. Does anyone make a dash cap that covers the speaker grill in the
center of the dash?  (That is a speaker grill isn't it?)
