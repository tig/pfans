Hi Folks

My car is a 90 S2 with 60k mi.  I've just now removed the
cam cover to check on the infamous chain tensioner.  

My question is about the cam cover itself.  Upon removal,
I was surprised how very lightweight the cover is.  Surprised
too that the inside is painted with the same paint as the outside
surface, and that the inside paint is bubbled in places and flaked
in one area (small - about 1/8" round) revealing the gray material
beneath.

Is the cam cover some sort of plastic?  Is the compromised paint
on the inside surface a potential problem?

Second question -- reveals my mechanical naivete -- in preparing to
remove the cover, I removed the two black plastic plug wire guides
that are screwed into the cam cover.  One of the screws was siezed
in the cover and sheard off.  My intention is to drill this out
and clean out the threads with a tap.  The trepidation with
which I approach this is linked to my uncertainty about the cam cover
material.  Can anyone help me out?

Thanks much
T. Leen
