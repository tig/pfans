Joseph -- here are instructions for getting to your odometer ('83-'85
944s only):
1. Park your car with the wheel at TDC (assuming your car has true
alignment). Disconnect the battery.
2. Remove the horn pad by gently pulling up. Unclip the horn contact
wire.
3. Use a 23mm socket to unbolt the wheel. Don't lose the washer. Remove
the wheel.
4. Very gently, pull the blinker/cruise control/wiper/washer switch unit
out. The two combination switches are attached with plastic pins, pull
the entire unit out without separating the two switches. Hang the unit
under the steering column or unplug and put it away.
5. Use a Phillips #2 (short) on the two screws holding the dash cluster
in. The screws are in the combination gauge and the tach, on the upper
surfaces.
6. Pull the entire cluster out as far as it will move.
7. Reach behind and unscrew the odometer cable. May need wide pliers.
Now the cluster will be accessible from behind.
8. Unplug the ground and signal wires to the odometer/speedometer. Take
the instrument bulbs out, keep them in their harnesses.
9. Undo the white plastic clip at the base of the odometer.
10. Push the unit from behind the cluster (NOT FROM THE FRONT) toward
the front. It has a rubber band around it -- will take some effort to
push it out. Wiggling may help.

If you cannot pop the instrument out of the cluster in #10, you can
unplug all signal wires and instrument bulbs to the entire cluster. Then
you can take the cluster indoors and invert it on a flat surface. This
makes taking an instrument out, putting it back in and realigning it
much easier. You might also investigate the innards of the odometer --
in my case the problem was a misaligned nylon gear. Popping that back in
position restored the odometer -- the speedometer was already
functional.

 it. Dr. Piech had a ball blowing off 951 owners with it. A simple
 installation. Dr. Piech won a 500DM bet from one of his relatives over
 this. So they wouldn't sell him bodies to let Audi have a real sports
 car.

I don't know if I buy any of that, Jim.  I'm going to have to check it out in
the Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide!!!

 Recently I have noticed a stumble and a loss of power in my '89 951 upon
 hard acceleration (more than 75% throttle.)  Sometimes it pull perfectly
 with full power (I love this car!) but sometimes it seems like it misses,
 like the FI is screwed up somehow (I hate this car!) Basically, it feels
 like the turbo never kicks in.
 
 I have also noticed (a few months back) that it will occasionally hunt at
 idle speed. Occasionally revs would hang around 1800 for a while before
 coming down, and sometimes it would idle at 1000 and then up to 1800 and
 slowly back down. That problem doesn't seem to happen much any more, perhaps
 because it is colder here. >>

Tim,
I'd suspect the throttle position switch.  When mine went bad, I had exactly
the same symptoms.

On occasion, we've seen disputes on this list over whether or not particular
advice is sound, and whether someone should even offer advice if they're not
sure of what they're saying.  In general, the consensus of the group seems to
be that there's a lot of good info sharing going on here; incorrect info gets
corrected quickly enough; once you've been on the list for a while you know
whose advice you can trust; and in the end, we're all better off if we
encourage well-intentioned participation in this forum, even if that means
having to forgive some mistakes.

I was thinking about that tonight when, while out doing a little shopping at
the local mall,  I stopped into a bookstore and came across a copy of the "New
1997 Edition" of the book The Illustrated Porsche Buyers Guide, by a guy named
Batchelor.  I've seen the book many times before in various bookstores over
the years, so I assume it's pretty popular.  In fact, I had looked at it
before when considering different Porsche models to buy.  (I know -- I must
sound pretty cheap for reading books at the store rather than buying them!).
I decided to leaf through it to see what the writer had to say about my
current car, an '88 Turbo S. 

I have to tell you that I've now lost all faith in the information provided
via this list!  Contrary to what I've read here and in the FAQ, according to
the "buyers guide," the 88 944 Turbo S was a limited edition  model of the
Turbo which utilized the 4-VALVE/CYL. HEAD OF THE 944S TO PRODUCE AN
ADDITIONAL 30 HP, RELATIVE TO THE 2-VALVE/CYL. STANDARD-MODEL TURBO!!!  (p.
141).   What's more, you guys with 89 Turbos seem to think you have all the
goodies of the 88 Turbo S.  Think again!!  The special edition 4-valve Turbo S
was discontinued after the 1988 model year and Porsche returned to the
standard 944 Turbo offering for 1989 (p. 142), according to Mr. Batchelor!
Now I don't know who Mr. Batchelor is, but he's got a published book, with
glossy color pictures, on the shelves of all the major bookstores, dammit!  He
must know what he's talking about!

My point --aside from discouraging anyone from buying the so-called buyers
guide (is there a buyers guide to automotive books?) -- is that the beauty of
this list is that the collective wisdom of the participants is impressively
broad and deep, and is also self-correcting.  Mistaken information doesn't
stand for long.  You can generally sort out the good from the bad, and the
expectation is for opinion and advice, not necessarily undisputed fact.
Better yet, the information is free, unlike that offered by Mr. Batchelor!  

OK, I feel better now.  Thanks.
