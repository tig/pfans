Well it was a DME relay and a cracked rotor ... All is well and got alot of
other minor things done.

Thanks for everyone's help that put in there 2 cent. All those cents saved
me alot of dollars. Also I would like to say thanks to Jim Ellison from
European Performance who spent alot of time on the phone with me walking me
through some trouble shooting (for free). A whealth of knowledge. Anyone in
the area (NC) or out of the area should look him up. He has very reasonable
prices on parts. 919-851-5084.


Thanks to all and have Merry Christmas
Todd

>I happened to see BadBob951 reply to your 951 start/ running problem.  I

>crankshaft position impulse senders.  They are the two black rectangular
>Bosch-type connectors behind the intake manifold along with the round
>junction for the O2 sensor. They have a habit of coming loose, but are

>or just tape together, etc...   Hope this helps- let me know if it
