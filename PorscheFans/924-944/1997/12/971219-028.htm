Ed et al,

I am sorry for any confusion as I never intended to strike out against 
your honor or, your zeal for that matter.  I must admit, your notation 
about the ribbon around your finger was very cute and I did get a good 
smile.  Although we do not know where your finger has been, we are 
pleased to hear that it has one first place ;-).

As for for your request for opinions, I believed that I have served mine, 
but I regret that the point was never correctly taken.

For those of you that are having a hard time following the crux of the 
biscuit here, I refer you to a post Ed made earlier that is available on 
the 944 archives (December 19th 1997) which was a response to my 
"opinion" about Prolong oil treatment.  The post is much too long for me 
to include.

As for the issue of all such treatments (I call them snake oils), perhaps 
the following will enlighten you.  However, if for some reason you choose 
to be endarkened, I can offer no further help.

To that end, I would like to introduce all of you to a physicist named 
Irving Langmuir who was well renown in the early to middle part of this 
century.  If I remember the story correctly, Langmuir made some 
observations that I think apply directly to this and many other subjects, 
and although I may sometimes apologize for my words, I do not apologize 
for any of the words that follow.

Langmuir stated that there were six symptoms of pathological research.
 
"1) The maximum effect is produced by a causative agent of barely 
detectable intensity.
2) The effect is of a magnitude that remains close to the limit of 
detectability.
3) The investigators claim great accuracy of measurement.
4) Fantastic theories are presented that contradict experience.
5) Criticisms are met by ad hoc explanations presented on the spur of the 
moment.
6) The ratio of supporters to critics rises to somewhere near 50 percent 
and then falls gradually to oblivion."

In a message dated 97-12-19 12:42:16 EST, you write:

<< Torque on a fastener is a function of the force of the fastener shoulder 
 on the mating surface, not the threads. >>

What do you think reacts against the mating surface force?  The force exerted
on the threads.  If there was no force exerted by the threads, then the bolt
would come right out.  Thats why there are threads on there, and that's why
threads strip when you overtighten stuff, more force is applied to the threads
than the material can physically support.  

I have a BS in ME, but I'm 4 yrs removed and haven't been working in the
field, so I can't give a precise theory based lecture.  As far as I know,
specified torque values are for a clean dry thread.  Theoretically, you could
list two specified torqes, one w/ lubricant, and one w/o.   Here's my attempt
at explaining the theory.

When you tighten a fastener, there are two primary forces involved.  Both of
these forces are originating at the thread mating surfaces.  One force (we'll
call it TF for thread force) is developed by one thread face pushing against
the other thread face when you screw the fastener in/on.  Until the two items
you are bolting together meet, the screw moves inward with little resistance.
Once the items make contact, there is no place for the fastener to go, so it
deflects (or stretches.)  Without getting into stress and strain equations,
the more you tighten the fastener now, the more force is exerted between the
treads.  This force on the threads acts perpendicular to the thread surface,
which is slightly at an angle from the centerline of the fastener.  This force
can be broken up into two other forces, one that acts along the centerline of
the fastener (and is equal to the force that the two items being held together
are subjected to) and a the other is at a tangent to the thread, and causes a
torsional force to be exerted on the fastener.  The second primary force is
the frictional force between the threads which acts in at a tangent to the
threads as well.  This also adds a torsional force on the fastener.  

So now you have the force along the centerline of the fastener (which is the
critical force involved, such as the clamping between the head and block).
This is the force that must be a certain value depending on what you're doing.
However, you can't measure this outright.  The only way we can get close to
measuring this force is indirectly through the torque applied to the fastener.
This force is always proportional to the torsional force applied by the
threads pushing on each other.  The additional torsional force due to friction
is then added to the thread's pushing torsional force, to get the specified
torque.  

When you add lubricant to the fastener, you decrease the frictional force.
Then, when you set the fastener to the specified torque (which is equal to the
sum of the frictional torque and the thread applied torque) you are actually
setting it with a higher thread applied torque (because you have less
frictional torque) and this corresponds to a greater force along the
centerline of the fastener (i.e., your clamping force or pre-load.)

I know this is probably poorly written and very confusing, sorry.  I
wrote/erased a couple of times trying to explain it.  Again, if we were
sitting down w/ pen and paper, I could explain it better.
