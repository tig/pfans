Hello fellow Porsche-Fans.

This is a me too letter!

To the people who asked about what body parts are the same on the =
924/944
could you post the answers to the group. I'd like to know the answer to =
that one
myself.

Also I'm looking for a plastic model kit of my 924. =20

A friend of mine has a kit  that I really want bad, but he won't give it =
up. It's a 1980's 924 kit that was made by Revell. I've asked the hobby =
stores around Michigan if they could find it in any of the old =
catalogues, and they can't even find the reference numbers to the kit, =
so it must not have run very long...Let me know if you have one, or know =
where to get one. (E-mail me the model's reference number if you would =
please).

Thanks for the band-width.
