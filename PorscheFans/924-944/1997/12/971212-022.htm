	Installed the Bosch 13913 oxygen sensor today ($48.99 NAPA
Auto Parts).  Removal of the old sensor was easier than
expected. 22mm crescent wrench - no problem.  Good advice
from Ezra Hall re:  attaching a string to the plug so that,
when I pulled it down from the engine compartment, I had an
easy route back.  The parts are physically almost identical
and the numbering is similar.  The soldering of the wires
was no problem - again per Ezra Hall, the "joints" were
staggered to avoid bare wire contact.  Installation is
somewhat difficult due to the tendency of the three foot
wire and plug to want to coil which provides an energy
force that wants to unscrew the plug as you screw it in. 
Finally, "balled" the wire up so that I could turn the wire
and the plug.

	To recap, I have an 87 944S and I have been complaining
for more than ayear about idle related problems (stalling
after high speed trips); excessive "hunt" when decelerating
quickly...etc.  Last week I simply unplugged the O2 sensor
and the problems abated and the car ran great.  

	With the Mustang sensor, the performance is not nearly as
bad as it was, but not as good as with the sensor
unplugged.  I do not believe this is due to using this
sensor, but rather suggests other related problems (car has
114,000 miles).  I have not had the time to measure gas
mielage, but expect an improvement.

	Also,  in reference to my fuse blowing non-functioning
a/c, ther mechanic unplugged the clutch coil and it diddn't
blow the fuse so we are looking for a coil and find that
everybody wants to sell either the entire clutch or a whole
compressor.  Any help??

thanks to Ezra
