     I recently decided to find out exactly why Porsche Doors won't close
     once opened from the inside at any temperature below 0 C (Which us
     Canadians seems to spend most of our lives in) I waited until the car
     was sufficiently cold and then brought it into the garage to have a
     look while the door was still having problems.
     The problem was in the cable itself, Once the door handle was pulled
     the cable would bind up and stop the handle from releasing. As the car
     warmed up I noticed a considerable amount of condensate actually leak
     out of the cable.

     After a liberal dose of LPS lubricant and some heavier grease on the
     ends of the cable, I reassembld the door and so far it looks like it
     works. The coldest it has been so far is about -13 and the door has
     worked fine, we'll see what happens when it hits -35 in january.

     Now does anyone know why the heat is so pathetic and the car blows
     frigid air at idle? I've been thinking it may be a clogged heater
     core, but I see other people having the same problem on here.

     Can someone tell me if they've found anyone who manufactures seat kits
     for the 944? I'de like to redo them but prefer to just buy a kit and
     do it myself rather than take them into a reupholstery shop.
