Well, I went, I saw, I practically puked and I left.  What a piece of
crap.  It all 'looks' very nice...until you drive it.  Bad clutch, bad
brakes, horrible shaking, sunroof doesn't work (owner said "is it
supposed to go up?"), hatch glass is seperated, pulls left, leaks oil
out of every place imaginable, power steering is screwed up somehow.  It
was like my car...if I dropped it from an airplane.  I can't believe how
bad these cars feel when they aren't 'right'.  SO, I'm once again very
happy with my baby.  My friend is disappointed that she can't have mine,
but who knows...maybe I'll find a 951 someday that I can't resist.  I
did like that turbo kick  :)  except the lurching (I think the turbo is
screwed up too) 

HEY Scrapman!!  Come and haul that piece of crap away and sell the parts
to people who take care of their cars.  Me?  I'll just put a spring
centered clutch in mine and putt around Roebling Road at less than
insane speeds.  Then I'll really wish I had a turbo.
