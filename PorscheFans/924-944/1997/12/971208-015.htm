This message is in response to some questions that have been asked. Is 
the 944 turbo frame any stronger than the 944 frame? It might be, but we 
recommend that you reiforce the frame anyway to ensure support in the 
long run.
Is the value of my 924\944 going to drop if it was convertible? No way! 
Any car that had a convertible version is always worth a lot more  than 
hardtop, consider the 911. Furhtermore 924's aren't worth a whole lot 
from the get go, but a 924 cabriolet is very enticing  and valuable in 
Southern California (apprx. $8,500).

>Hi 924/944 fans,
>      I have designed a Porsche 924/944 Cabriolet conversion kit that 
is 
>sharp, sporty, and will turn heads. This conversion kit is absolutely 
>beautiful and is certainly one of the most exotic looking convertibles 
>on the road. It requires about 20 to 40 hours of effort depending on 
>your shop skills, but is easy when following the step by step video. 
>This kit was was originally offered as complete job only for $7,000 but   
>the kit is available to everyone for $2,500. Be one of the few proud 
>owners of the 924\944 Cabriolet's that will get much attention. Let the  
>wind blow through your hair in one of Porsche's most aerodynamic and 
>best handling cars ever built. For more information E-mail at 
>Choptops28@Hotmail.com or call (626) 282-0220 and ask for Larry.    
>Supplies are diminishing quickly!
