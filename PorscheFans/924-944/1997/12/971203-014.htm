I'm curious, what performs better in the long run, a 968 or a =
GIRLFRIEND? Also, are there any particular model years to look for? 

Take your birthyear, add between two and ten, and look for that model.
 Should provide the best bang for the buck.

Also, when inspecting a prospective girlfriend for purchase / lease, the
opposite rules apply:

You DONT want a model that's been serviced regularly.
You DONT want a model that was previously owned by a good friend.
You DONT want a model that wears a bra in the rain.


   Anything else to look out for?

Yeah, check the ball joints.  The tighter, the better.

Jeff (almost ashamed to put my last name) Fortenbery
'87 951 (which matches none of the above specifications)
'77 911S (ditto)
'58 Wife (matches three of the above four specifications)
