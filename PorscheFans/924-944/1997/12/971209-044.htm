Farzaan makes some critical distinctions here.  There's a difference
between quickness and power.  Modifications may give a better throttle
response, but not do much for overall acceleration or top speed.  And if
they do increase hp, the improvement may not be noticable, particularly in
a very stable car like the 944.  
From my limited experience with a late '85 944, I found that the
Autothority chip and the throttle cam really did make a noticable
improvement in quickness off the line.  The stock car bogged when
accelerating from a standing start; the mods improved the low-end response.
 I didn't have to rev to 3000 to make the car take off.  However, even with
the cat removed and the addition of an aftermarket cat-back, the top end
did not improve noticably.
