The best thing to do is take the chips out first.  That should give
you an indication of what's been done.  If it's APE, it's good the boost
bolt, if it's old Weltmeister, it's drilled cycling valve, if it's
new Weltmeister, it's wastegate shim and higher rate FPR.

But, the main purpose of this email is to make sure that you do some
real number testing of the before and after.  The ideal setup would 
be like we did on the dynojet.  Do baseline runs with your current
chips, pull them out and return to stock, do a few runs with the stock
chips, then put the new setup on and do a few runs.  Their is a new
test that Dynojet talks about on their website:
http://www.dynojet.com/automotive/index.htm  It's called the fast
acceleration test.  It tests for throttle response.  I want to do this
test next time to compare my chips to Paul's as my car lacks low end
like crazy, even though it doesn't show up on the dyno.  To do this test,
you do a full power run, determine where the torque peak is (around 4250rpm
on the "S" models).  On your next run, shift through the gears from 1st to
4th, hit the sampling button, take the car up to 5250rpm, completely
shut the throttle, when the engine comes back down to 4250rpm, floor it
up to redline.  This will tell you how good the throttle response is (or
so Dynojet says).

Dynojet's web site lists the locations.  The seat of your pants can
be very deceptive.  An example is the throttle cam, it makes it feel
like the car has more power, but if it were on a dyno, it would show
that no new power has been found.  The response test noted above might
show something.

Then, report the results to the list and especially me. :)
