Hi All,

I need some help on my 87 951.  This is so wierd.
When I step on the brake, the car stops and it seems
the brakes are working fine, however when I lift up my
foot a bit and press the brake a little harder the brake
petal drops further down to a point where I can feel
the resistance, and then when I repeatedly pumping
the brake petal more I can even floor the whole brake
petal all the way down and then it feels like I have no
brake at all and the brake petal has no resistance.
The situation becomes worse when I stopping at a downhill.
The brake fluid reservoir stills has a lot of brake fluid
and apparently no leak at all.  The previous owner told me
he did mistakenly pour a few ounce of Slick50 powersteering
fluid to the brake fluid reservoir before after I noticed
some overspill next to the reservoir.  But since he
had driven the car for couple months after without
any problem so I thought it was okay.  Now it doesn't seem
like is okay anymore.  Please help.  Thanks,

Tom 

A fast 951 with no brakes.
