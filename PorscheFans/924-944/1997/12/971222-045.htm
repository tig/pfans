According to the manual (remember we're talking Hayne's) a compression
check should be done with the engine at operating temp. But conversely
the plugs should only be removed on a cold engine. How is this
resolved? Is this an exception to the rule. Should I just be very
careful removing the plugs? Of course I would let the motor cool before
reinstalling them.

P-fans:

I recently had my 92 968 coupe in for its 60k service at an independent shop.
The non-synthetic transaxle lube was drained and replaced with Motul synthetic
gearlube.  When cold, the 6-speed now shifts with more notchiness than before.
Once warm, the shift quality is unchanged from before, which is/was excellent.
The shop owner says that this is characteristic of synthetic gear lubes, but
that synthetic is better for the transaxle overall.

Has anyone experienced this before?

Hello Maurice
	Sorry my response to your Question is so late - I was out of town. I would
reccomend the Snap-On set. I have both. First, I bought the Sear's set (by the
way they are called "Allen Sockets") they are kind of cheaply made, The Snap-
On set is far and away top quality. If you want the best fork up the cash. I
think the Snap-On set ran about $100, for the 2mm to 10mm set. 

								Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

PS: MATCO Tools (800-321-8227) or MAC Tools (I did not have their phone
number, but they are in Washington Court House, Ohio)

Subject: Does Craftsman make Cheesehead sockets (xmas ideas)

I need to give my Christmas list to someone who is nowhere near a P Car
dealer, but does have a Sears, therefor Craftsman tools come to mind.

One thing that comes to mind is Cheesehead sockets or as Snap On calls them
Triple Square.

My local Sears (in Canada) claims no such thing exits in the Craftsman
line. Is he right or does someone have a better name or part number for these.

I would ideally like a set that fits the CV bolts and hatch Pins screws so
what range in mm would I need?

9 shopping days and counting...

Everyone,

Any idea what it would mean if you had a VIN with a letter in the 9th 
position, i.e. WP0AA094XEN458968?

Hello P-Fans
	You wrote:  Now the car has a very strange cut off. Whilst driving the engine
cuts of above 4000rpm in all the gears. Having the car in no gear and reving
the engine it goes all the way to 6500rpm where the rpm limiter cuts in.
Any suggestions what may be the problem?
	I believe if you can rev the engine above 4K rpm's not moving but the engine
does not rev above 4K in gear - you have a ignition problem. I would suspect
on the primary side of the ignition. If your problem was fuel - I do not think
the engine would rev above 4K all the time. Fuel flow is fuel flow wether it
is at idle not moving or in gear.
	I would say that the primary side of the ignition is the culprit. The energy
from the coil is either not getting to the spark plug (ie: distb cap & rotor,
plug wires worn, coil wire shot ect...) or that the coil is not producing
enough power or voltage at high RPM's. The fuel is putting out the flame or
spark under load - this is why the engine will rev past 4K while not under
full load. 
	I would check the resistance of the plug wires and the coil wire. If the plug
wires have more than 5K ohms and the coil wire should have no more than 1K
ohms - if there is higher resistance replace the wires. Check the cap & rotor.
Look for carbon tracing on the inside and outside of the distb cap.  Last I
would test the coil - there is a way to check the resistance along the #1 &
#15 terminal - but I do not have the specs, look in your shop manual. 
	I do nat think your problem is too hard to pin point just keep at it and let
us know what you find. 

							Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol

I have an 81 model 924 turbo with 300000km. All worked just fine so far.
Well you know, except the usual problems we all have with our cars.
Now the car has a very strange cut off. Whilst driving the engine cuts
of above 4000rpm in all the gears. Having the car in no gear and reving
the engine it goes all the way to 6500rpm where the rpm limiter cuts in.
Any suggestions what may be the problem?

I have a 1980 931 with the exact same problem you have. After much
advise from this list, and a lot of work, I have never been able to
solve this problem. If you solve the problem please let me and the list
know. TIA and good luck.

Hello Raymond & P-Fans
	On my '86 951, I usually get between 800 - 1300 miles before I have to top up
the oil level. I use Mobil-1 15W-50 synthetic oil. My car has over 165K, I
have driven it for 55K of its life and is weel matained thruout its life. I
think Porsche's own wear limit is 1qt every 500 miles!!! VW & Audi also go by
this wear limmit before any waranty engine work can be done! 

					Hope this gives you insight, David Jalali

Subject: 944 turbo oil consumption

I'm new so please bare with me if this is a repetitive question.
I've recently acquired an '87 turbo w/ 72,000 miles. The oil pressure
gauge is always nearly pegged if it isn't fully pegged. The lowest the
needle has ever dropped is to about 4.5. The dealer where I purchased
this vehicle says that everything is within working tolerance. The
vehicle also consumes about 1 quart of oil per 1,000 miles. I don't
hammer the car in town but I'm not timid about passing on the highway
when required. What's the likely prognosis? Or is this unusual appetite
normal?

Raymond

Hello Chris & P-Fans
	First of all, a Porsche is a Porsche, not an econobox. You have to ask
yourself what is the design criteria?  Porsche uses a high lift camshaft -
more overlap - more emissions. Are cars were meant to go - stop - and corner.
The emissions will be slightly higher than your average rice burner! 
	Your cars emission results: 
	
The HC numbers were about 1/3 to 1/4 of the legal limit (of 220ppm), 
and the CO numbers about 1/2 of the limit.
CO2 was around 15%, with a minimum of 6% required. (% dillution) 
	
	As far as I see, these number look fine to me! All of these numbers are well
bellow the Max emissions. I have seen cars that just barley pass. Sometimes
factory cars barley pass - like a VW Vanagon's - if you did not ream the thing
before the test, inorder to get the cat good and hot - it would fail!

Subject: 944NA emissions

To those of you in emissions/smog check areas:

I'm looking at buying a 1988 988NA with nearly 120k miles.
I saw the numbers of its last Washington State emisions check report, 
and they were high in my opinion.
The seller says that is pretty normal, and in fact you'd want to run a 
little richer to keep the engine healthy.

What do you all think of the numbers, and the sellers statement:

The HC numbers were about 1/3 to 1/4 of the legal limit (of 220ppm), 
and the CO numbers about 1/2 of the limit.
CO2 was around 15%, with a minimum of 6% required.

The reason why I though it low is that even my 82 Japanese econobox 
with 135k miles has MUCH lower numbers on HC and CO.

Thanks,

Chris
