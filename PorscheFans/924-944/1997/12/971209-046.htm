I am resending this message because it looks like the Dec 5 listing was =
lost in all the cheese head messages. I would appreciate any wisdom that =
the list members can provide.

----------
Also I am trying to sell my 1993 Honda Accord LX with a 5 speed and =
71,000 miles. (I have to since, I bought the Porsche to replace it.) The =
car is in good shape. If you live in the San Francisco bay area and are =
interested please  send me an e-mail at dieter.schulze@wmeng.com or =
dieter@sinewave.com.

Below is my original letter.
----------

I have just purchased a 1991 944S2 coupe. The car is exactly what I was =
looking for for a long time. Anyway, I put the car up on blocks and did =
a though inspection of the undercarriage and drive line. The car has =
111,400 miles on it and is very clean. No oil leaks on any of the engine =
components. The only thing I found that I have a question is on the rear =
axle shafts.=20

The inner CV joints are some what greasy and the area around the =
transaxle case where the axle shaft is, is also greasy. There is no oil =
dripping from anywhere. When I grab a hold of the inner CV joint to test =
the bearing freeplay, I can wiggle the CV joint up and down slightly. =
The drivers side CV is pretty tight but the passenger side is looser =
then I would expect.  My question is how much radial free play should =
there be?=20

I also tested that the axle half shafts can slide in and out on the =
splines. I expected this movement. As a note, I will be getting the full =
manual set soon but I wanted to find out from other owners.

Thanks

hey Porschefans,

after several weeks, several hundreds of dollars,  several new parts, and
several used parts, i've finally got my little red/burgandy/purple (??) 924
home again. the saga started when i sent out my head to be overhauled,  they
find "the fracture", they weld it and i decide they install it (just in case).
all goes well until i go to pick up the car, and she starts spitting oil at
the mechanic (funny, in a sickening sort of way), off again comes the head, in
goes new rings, bearings, water pump, timing belt, and a host of miscellaneous
items. for the second time i go to pick up my 924, and find that the shift
linkage that i never got around to adjusting after i replaced the transaxle
has snapped (oops). off i go to my old 016 paperweight to procure the little
sucker, get back, and boom , there goes one of those little hoses at the back
of the head that the mechanic didnt tighten up quite enough, he fixes it.
so now i think, is it worth it? shouldnt i just get myself out of this mess
and buy a saturn or new reliable japanese car or something?
then i drive her home, sure, its rained heavy and the cars steamy inside
because the plastic i put under the battery shifted and leaked through. sure
the moister has shorted out half of my electrics and now the defogger isnt
working. 
but then i start working my way up to speed, getting the feel for the now new
engine , improved suspension, ride through a few curves like im on a rail and
i realize, hey, i just passed a new saturn, and boy are they ugly............

happy holidays to all,
eric (ericj001@aol.com)
78-924 if nothing else, FUN! :)
