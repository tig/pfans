Kevin is right about the shift linkage.  I used a small block of wood and 
a hammer to gently tap the plastic tube forward.  There are molded 
"warts" on the tube that help keep it located centrally and it can be 
pushed forward with some effort to overcome the frictional forces.  Once 
through, pull it forward through the torque tube until the tail end is 
almost past the torque tube opening.

Pull back the rubber boot over the rear of the shift linkage bar and 
remove the safety wire from the bolt.  Remove that bolt and push the 
shift linkage bar free from the transaxle shift linkage.  The shift bar 
linkage can now be pushed forward too, however, you need to rotate the 
shifter end of that tube from inside the car at the shift knob boot hole 
after disconnecting the shift lever assembly.  You then remove the two 
bolts holding that assembly and pull the shifter knob out.  Rotate the 
shifter linkage bar toward the drivers door (90 degrees) and then push it 
forward as far as it will go being careful not to rip the foam rubber.  I 
do not remember, but i think it goes under the foam rubber.

Back to the transaxle...

The actual balance point for the transaxle is 2.625" (2 5/8") forward of 
the rear location hole Kevin spoke of.

I built a wooden platform from 2 X 4 lumber and a 1/2" plywood (18" 
square) top that has three 3/8" threaded rods mounted on it that match 
the three installation holes on the transaxle.  Using nuts and washers, I 
was able to precisely support the transaxle at any angle on this platform 
which was, in turn, supported by my floor jack.

I found the balance point after I got the transaxle out and sat the whole 
assembly on the floor.  I had to guess when I built the adapter and I was 
wrong.  However, once out, I used a broom handle as a fulcrum and rolled 
the platform, transaxle and all, over the handle until it balanced.  I 
then relocated the Sears 7/8" socket that I used as a pin to sit in the 
hole vacated by the floor jack cup.  I bolted that socket to the bottom 
of the transaxle adapter platform.  Now I can effortlessly remove and 
replace a transaxle by my self (the 10 stone weakling that I am).

If you are interested in the design I can send you the illustrated plans. 
 They are in Word 6.0 format.

I only brought this up as I was concerned that you might accidentally 
drop that transaxle if not properly balanced.  I have removed the 
transaxle only using a floor jack and it is not fun.  Reinstalling is 
even less fun.

>Greg, there are two things you need to move out of the way.  The first

>do disconnect the linkage at the shift lever (E-clip), rotate it, then 
>push it forward 30 cm.  I have never been able to make this work, I
