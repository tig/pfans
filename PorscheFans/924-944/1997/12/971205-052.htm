Hmm. A hypothesis here. Larger rubber (I can't remember if you said what
you had before), will, all things being equal, will accentuate response,
i.e., the "time" to transition from understeer to oversteer will be faster.
So, yes, wider rubber gives more sideways grip, but at a cost of when that
grip does start to go, it transitions faster.

If you had, say, 205's front/225 rear before, then yes, the car should
understeer less now. Also, the effect of alignment settings would be
magnified. Tire type also has a big effect. Some tires just give more
warning than others.

This is a matter of great debate :-). The rubber centre *is* kinder to the
transaxle (assuming non-perfect shifting). The spring centre has less
failure modes.

Certainly have a look at the transaxle fluid (i.e., change it) and if there
are any metal particles in the old fluid, have a knowledgeable person look
and see.
