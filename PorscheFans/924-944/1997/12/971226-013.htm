Hi Gang,



I am having difficulty tracking down a problem with

my horns (87 951) not working.  I have verified the 

horns themselves (ran a wire to the battery).  I have

checked the black/yellow wire for continutiy back to

the N24 connector under the central electric box.  I've

also checked the fuse 3/G13-30 connection as well as the

N24/G13-87 connection.  The relay audibly clicks when 

the horn switch is pressed and I've swapped relays with

the ignition relay.  Oh, I also ran a wire from the horns

to fuse 3, and that sounds them as well.  The only things

left are the lines to the relay from the horn switch. 

Since the relay clicks, can I rule these out?



Right now, the electrics box is sitting next to the car

so I have full access to all of those great wires.

Can someone maybe suggest where else to look. This is

driving me crazy.



Thanks,

Clark
