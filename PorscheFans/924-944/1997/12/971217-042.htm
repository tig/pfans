Neil,

I guess I am becoming a real stick in the mud, but I would get the 
correct offset wheels for your car.  I know the offset difference is not 
too much, however, I am sure there must be some effect with improper 
offsets to the handling of the car.  I would go further as to say that it 
probably is not an improvement.

On the other hand, you can always increase the effect and take on the 
look of all those cars with the custom wheels that stick out clear past 
the fenders.  I see many Hondas with this modification.  Owners think 
that they have an Indy car with the open wheels.

What many of those people do not realize is that this modification does 
not really improve handling as expected.  Moving the mass of the wheel 
outward from the original designed location changes the function of the 
suspension geometry.  It also throws water and dirt all over the place.

It is just another great fad, but you do not see too many runners wearing 
shorts with the ultra low waist band and the crotch located at the knees. 
 At least none that are successful.
