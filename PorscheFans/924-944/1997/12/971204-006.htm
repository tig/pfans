My research was right, 924 and 944 doors are the same. Part numbers check
out, everything lines up, EXCEPT... the early 924 doors(at least before '80)
I bought won't latch to the '88 chassis I have. I didn't bother to check the
door latch part # s. OK, a donor car gives up its latches, but they won't
attach to the door since the mounting holes and door handle mechanism is
different. Its not just the latches, the striker attached to the chassis must
be different too. 
Question:
Does anyone have an early 924 that they could compare to a post '80 924 or
944 and tell me if the striker bolts are different and if the early ones have
the same bolt pattern to attach to the late chassis. If they'll bolt up I'm
looking to buy some. If not I may have to buy some doors.
TIA
