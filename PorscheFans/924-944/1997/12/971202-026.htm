IMO, the lubrication factor is for the consumer's money to slip easily out
of their wallet and into the manufacturer's bank account.  I don't think I
would even try it in a lawn mower or snow blower, much less a car (Porsche
or otherwise).  I haven't seen any of the auto manufacturers using or
endorsing these products.  I can't wait for HSN to get hold of this product.

have just floated on top of the 4 feet of water instead of "U-Boating")
