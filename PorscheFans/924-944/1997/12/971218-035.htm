Luis,
   I don't know how much I can help but here goes. I've had mine for
just over a year and 45k(that's right...~750 a week)! I have only had
to replace clutch, rear main seal, tie rods and this was within 2
months of purchase so related to PO and not my use. Work done since
I've put into service has been limited to wheel bearings, tires,
alignment, front shocks and front suspension bushings but all those
items were also shot when I purchased it. I think the high miles puts
very little stress on the car. I use Mobil 1 15W50 and replace every 6k
with filter. I think cleaning the air filter regularly is important.
   I don't push mine as far as you say you do yours. Unlike most of the
others going fast doesn't really appeal to me but I am a little too
nervous about head gaskets to push it hard. I do like pushing in the
twisties and this is where the 944 shines.
   The cracked firewall has been mentioned before. What symptoms occur?
   Before someone flames me, yes I've had belts done, too. They are due
for a retension. I skipped a belt tension and it nearly cost me
dearly...broke the balance belt at 50mph. I've learned my lesson. 

Yours,

Joe Mitchell  <eyecare1@datastar.net>
