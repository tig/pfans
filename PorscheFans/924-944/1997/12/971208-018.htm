I hate to sound like a killjoy, but the fact that the calendar that the
Florida PCA is putting out excludes waterpumpers really torques me off.
I've been looking at calendars with the new year coming, and every one I've
seen is without 944's, 928's, 968's, 924's. As a huge 944 and 928 fan, I
also love 911's, especially 993's. It seems to me that it doesnt work the
other way around. 911 lovers seem to have an attitude when it comes to our
beloved cars. Have you ever picked up the magazine 911 and Porsche world?
Dont bother looking for a waterpumper in there, they pretend we dont exist. 
Again, I love 911's, but the waterpumpers are some of the most beautiful
and technically advanced Porsche's ever built. I dont mean to sound
annoyed, but I am. Perhaps a calendar of classic Porsches with equal
representation of all models could be produced. In the meantime, Ill just
have to change the days of the week on my 86 factory calendar so it matches
next year. It matched this year and has beautiful photos of all models.
On the upside, the biased view of our cars makes them affordable, so maybe
I should keep my mouth shut.
If I've offended anyone, feel free to flame me in public.
