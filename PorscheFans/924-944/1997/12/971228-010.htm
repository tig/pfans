On Tue, 23 Dec 1997 12:27:13 EST, Davidjalai <Davidjalai@aol.com> so
eloquently stated:

As far as racing videos goes, "In-car 956" is really good - it is an
in-car video of Derek Bell driving (and narrating) laps around the old
Nurburgring, Le Mans (without the chicane), Brands Hatch, Spa, and two
courses in Japan and South Africa. It is very well done and you get to =
see
some of the best courses (as they used to be!) in the World. I have seen
this video advertised in magazines and it is definitely worth having,
although as usual the video is much more expensive then it should be!
 If you can get a hold of "RUF CTR - Fascination on the Nurburgring" you
will be very happy! It is a video of a RUF driver taking the "Yellow =
Bird"
RUF CTR out for a couple of laps of the old Nurburgring.  This driver is
totally out of his mind, but it shows you how thrilling the car can be! =
It
is possibly the best video I have ever seen - but it is very hard to find
so see if you know somebody who can make you a copy. =20
