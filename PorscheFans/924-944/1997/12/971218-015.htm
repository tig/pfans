Just to back up Terry's comments, I did blow a head gasket on my
supercharged 944 at high speed, which resulted in destroying a couple a
cylinder walls.  If you want to supercharge, you should go into it from the
perspective that you are essentially developing a new engine, and be
prepared to make all components work together.  The supercharger may be
relatively easy to bolt on, but that's only the beginning of the process.
Wish I had been aware of that when I embarked on that fateful journey into
uncharted territory.
