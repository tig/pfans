Well, I decided to undertake this some input from PF and some guys odometer
page
..

- Removal of Steering Wheel, very simple..  It looks like there is red loctite
o
n there, but I could be wrong.  It seems a bit gummy for loctite.

- Take of Turn Indicator/Wiper assembly a bit different that the instructions I
received.  No one said anything about the three brass screws and the plastic
hou
sing that needed to be removed.  Nevertheless, I got through it. and disconnect
succesfully

- Take out two screws that holds the speedo/odo assembly in place. pull it out.
 Comes out 3 inches.  Now I'm stuck. I miraculously fish my hand behind it and
I
 push out the speedo, but the damn cables hold it in. I then attempt to fish my
hand up behind the dash.  Germans must have small hands and skinny arms,
because
 there is no way in hell I'm getting my fingers around that screw, nevertheless
a pliers or other wrench to disconnect the speedo cable.

- I reassemble, hell bent on the fact that I will never get it out.  Now I have
two dead dash light bulbs from my frustrations.... and an odo that still does
no
t work.

Thanks for your advice....

P.S.   Has anyone ever removed this damn thing?  If so, let me know your
secret.
