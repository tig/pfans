Hmm. Well, I just ordered a set from them today. They did say the boot they
will use is not the Beru (OEM) boot and as such doesn't seal against the
cam cover perfectly. This isn't a big concern to me as I rarely pour
water/oil on my cam cover :-), will not let dirt accumulate in the general
area anywho, blast the area with compressed air before pulling plugs, the
car is not a daily driver, etc. etc.

Of course, if one wants "install and forget" wires, then the Beru boot is
the way to go. I don't think pressuring Magnecor is going to accomplish
much as the main issue is the Beru boot. Magnecor could buy the Beru boots
but they have an integrated resistor which can be a bad thing when combined
with aftermarket race ignitions, and is unnecessary with resistance wires
like Magnecor's.

Just my 0.02cents... and I'll obviously know more about how good/bad the
fit actually is when they arrive (and I'll be able to take my old ones
apart to see what exactly is going on)
