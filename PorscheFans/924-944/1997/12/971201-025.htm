Well, my 85.5 944 is running great.  I just put a new head gasket,
waterpump, valves seals, etc etc in the little darling and now a friend
hooks me up with a friend of his selling an 86 951 for $7500.  I have
yet to see it (tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow..you're
only...Well you get the point), but my buddy who has seen it swears it's
immaculate with full records, Red on Tan leather, 128K, and basically
the cat's PJ's.  So, what can I say?  I'll have to go look, and might
have to go buy and have to join the ranks of those going too fast on the
street without trying very hard.  So, put the insurance companies on
alert, call out the local police reserves, inform Farzaan to watch his
email box for hop up questions and beware at the next PCA Drivers Ed
class in Roebling Road (February).  :)  Oh the excitement a Porsche puts
in my life...the girlfriend is a bit annoyed that I don't get this happy
over her very much....hmmm  Oh well, I can live with that.  :) Tomorrow
tomorrow....dadada, dedodo...
