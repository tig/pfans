Hello everyone.  Thanks to folks who have sent me tips for my radiator
R&R this coming Saturday morning.  Now I have a tip to offer.

I've had my 85.5 for a year and a half and a '78 924 before that.  Both
cars have allowed water to the passenger's side footwell and the 944 has
had problems with "wind whistle"  from the sunroof gasket. 
Occassionally, water will actually drip from the rear right corner of
the sunroof.  

Everybody knows to check beneath the battery.  Everybody knows to
carefully clear their drains.  Drains from the sunroof, drains from the
battery tray, etc..  BUT, what if you check all this stuff and still
accumulate water?!?  @#$%^&!

TIP:  Spread vaseline generously around the sunroof gasket.  I hesitated
at first, because of my recent paint work.  After checking with my paint
guy (Sikkens trained), I learned that there's no harm there, AND, not
only will the vaseline assist the seal of the roof because of its
consistency, but the rubber will benefit from the petroleum content.  It
will actually be caused to swell by absorbing oils, etc..  

So off I went and spread the stuff around the roof and also around the
passenger's door seal.  Five hard rains later, my carpet is bone dry
(and nobody is more surprised than me). I had long given up all hope of
solving this.  We'll see how often I have to repeat the application.
