Hi P-Fans,

I'm helping my friend with his new Koni shocks.  We've adjusted to ONE turn
as instructed by the included instructions.  But since it's such a hassel
to take off the shocks to adjust them, I would like to ask you guys what is
a good setting.  The shocks can turn 2.5 turns, but 1 turn is the
recommended.  Would 1.5 turn be too stiff, or break?  Appreciate all
experienced advice. 

TIA,
Tony

Steve:

There must be a short to ground for the fuse to blow.  Since the AC compressor
clutch was not at fault, a wire, between the fuse and clutch, that
intermittently shorts to ground is probably the cause.  Try to trace the
clutch wire and find where it passes through sheet metal holes or rubs against
something.

I hope this helps.  Merry Christmas to all P-Fans.

All,
I'ld like to nip this one in the bud if possible.  Twice in the last three
days my 951 took three or four cranks ("cranks" bein' a redneck term for the
engine turnes over three or four times).  It usually starts right up.  It also
seems to be running a little choppier than usual at idle.  My guess is that it
might be the ?flywheel position sensor? (I can't think of the exact name).

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Bob
