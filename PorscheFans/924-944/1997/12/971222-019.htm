David --

I sometimes wonder who decides how much these cars are worth, and what
criteria they use.  There's an important point that sometimes gets missed. 
The 944 S2 (along with a lot of other Porsches, of course) is a great car,
and IT IS NO LONGER MANUFACTURED.  It has passed into history.  And there
are not many new cars these days that occupy a similar niche and have
similar characteristics -- i.e., great handling, great shape, rear-wheel
drive, decent NA power, etc. 

Seems like you could charge pretty much want you want, depending on how
fast you want to move it.  From an historical perspective, the car can be
thought of as priceless.  Well, maybe that's going a little too far.  But I
wouldn't worry about being berated by someone with their nose stuck in a
Kelly Blue Book or even (dare I say this) an article in Excellence.  Ever
notice what vintage comic books and baseball cards are going for these
days.
