Yep, you're right. I misread the manual. I used the correct
terminal(no.7) but looked at the turbo spec. So I'm ok with the door
closed. But I'm curious about the door open reading. I got 300mV. It
seemed that the voltage increased as the door opened wider but I
couldn't get it any wider(I didn't completely remove the intake hose so
couldn't get my hand all the way in the meter). Still I was only
getting 300mV. The manual says it should have been 8V or greater. Would
it increase that much?

Haven't checked it. I'll do that.

How do you check for a weak injector?

Probably should plan on replacing. Never replaced AFAIK.

Thanks

A friend of mine is in serious need of an engine for a 1989 944 Turbo.  His
requirements are that it must be a 1988 "S" or 1989 951 block.  Other than
that, he is willing to consider new or used (must be able to be rebuilt),
short block or whole.  So, if you have or know of such an engine that is for
sale, please e-mail Bob Sandau privately at: OLDANDSLOW@AOL.COM.
