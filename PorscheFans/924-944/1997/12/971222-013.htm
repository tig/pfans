Joe with the power steering pump tensioner troubles,
    If the lock nut is spinning, the threads are stripped, but all hope is not 
lost. First, determine which rod is of which thread (one is reverse threaded, 
and was probably stripped by someone who didn't know that). You will need to 
loosen the nuts which you are currently soaking in penetrant, then you can 
turn the turnbuckle (tensioning rod) in the correct direction to loosen the 
belts. This will in turn apply pressure to the freely spinning nut which you 
can then turn with a wrench until it catches on the good remaining threads. If 
you just can't loosen the thing while it is attached to the car, you can 
remove the whole tensioning assembly by removing the nuts/bolts on the end of 
each threaded rod, and carefully use a piece of wood to pry the P/S pump to 
relieve pressure from the tensioning assembly while you can remove it. Once 
disassembled, if the threaded rod is stripped, you can use washers between the 
nut and turnbuckle to space the nut away from the stripped region. If the nut 
is stripped (less likely), you will need a new one.

Good luck!

Ezra
