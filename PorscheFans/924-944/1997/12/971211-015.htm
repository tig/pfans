Hi guys, I went to check out an 89 951 yesterday at a local used porsche
dealer. They wanted 15000 for it with 112000 miles. Visually, the outside
was outstanding, very good paint, a few rock chips, one tiny dent. Inside
was less exciting as the dash had many cracks and slight fading. I hate
dash cracks!! Mechanically, it seemed good, although the shocks felt like
they were tired. I could easily bounce the back end, while my car requires
prodigious force to move with no bounce. 
When I drove it I immediately noticed the engine felt peppier than mine at
low rpms. I"m curious if the throttle cam or engine map is different than a
non S. 
I noticed an exhaust leak near the muffler. The most disturbing problem was
letting off after full throttle caused a major jerky stumble.(Any ideas as
to cause) I dont think it was chipped as it felt about as fast as my
chipped 88 non S. 
Anyway, the combination of worn shocks, cracked dash, engine stumble and
non working electric seat adjustment coupled with 15000 asking price and
112000 miles made me pass on it. I"ll continue the search!!
I am curious about the seat. I thought the 89's came with the fully
adjustable heated seats and headlight washers. This car had neither. 
I really really liked the brakes and rims though.
