I  had a Z28 which had a bad case of blow-by which came through the PCV
valve on the head to the carburator filter housing.
In my 78-924 there is no such thing as a PCV valve , but there is a Crank
case ventilation hose which goes to the lower section of  the Air Filter /
Flow Sensor Assembley.
Now, is seeing oil by the air filter considered Blow-By ?
My 78-924 looses oil a bit (by the Air Filter) and you can actually feel the
air coming through
the hose (but no smoke). I always thought of it as a side effect of the High
Oil pressure (8 to 10 bars when cold) and high compression ratio (170 psi)
as well.
On the same note every car that I have seen which uses CIS (BMW, VW, AUDI,
and Porsche), has oil by the air filter.
Any Comments?
Mike
