I am glad I am not the only one curious about this.  According to the
aforementioned Delphic Oracle, the spring length when removed from the car
is 329mm = 12.95" for the inconstant wire and 356mm = 14.02" for the
constant wire.  Spring force at length 220mm is 3050 to 3250 N for the
inconstant vs 3082-3330N at 241mm for the constant.  

If I remember well, F = k * Dx, ie Spring Force = (spring rate constant) *
(compression (+) or expansion (-) of the spring).  Assuming that the cars
are lowered to the same amount, which may be the case for the M030 cars, I
would expect the longer springs to be more compressed than the shorter
ones, thus amounting to more force necessary to compress the spring
further.  Is this what is called pre-loading?  In effect, the longer
springs are stiffer than the shorter ones.  

What the technical specs book does not reveal is the geometry of the
springs, ie are they conical a la S2, or the usual cylindrical shape?  I
would expect the conical springs to compress more than cylindrical springs
as the coils can somewhat "nest" in each other leading to more suspension
travel.  No knowing this detail, I feel that Wes' question cannot be
satisfactorily answered.  Maybe some of the 90 and 91 951 owners can tell
us what their front springs look like, though I do not rememerb seeing
such owners on this list.

I do not know where the P/N is stamped.
