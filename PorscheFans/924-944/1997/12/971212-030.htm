Which one did you want feedback on? I've got a Borla on my Pathfinder, and
it's not that loud. Kind of a pleasant, deeper Italian sound.  People do
notice that it doesn't sound like a stock Pathfinder, and it definitely
improves revving through to redline in the first 3 gears.  Which is not to
say that it would improve Porsche performance -- stock truck mufflers are
pretty bad, so anything would improve performance.  Windward told me that a
Borla actually decreases hp in a 944 -- not sure I buy that.

On the B&B, an 994S driver in my PCA region has one, and likes it. Supposed
to be a 7-8 hp increase. It is not much louder, but more guttural and
authoritative. Sounds good. Particularly since 944s are always the quietest
cars on the track.

Neither one is "super loud".  Both sound "powerful and pleasant".
