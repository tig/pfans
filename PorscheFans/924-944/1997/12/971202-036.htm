Hi all,

In my search for engine parts I've noticed the turbo thermostat housing
on some of the cars I've looked at is *not* the 951 part but the 944
part.  The 951 part lets water go to the turbo, the 944 part does not.

The turbo thermostat housing is the plastic piece that is on the water
pump.  It seems that the 951 part is black and the 944 part is white (I
can't prove this though).  Funny, I didn't think about looking for a
part number on the housing, I'll look tonight.

If your turbo has the 944 one then your turbo probably isn't getting
adequate cooling.

The reason for separate housings is so that only one type of water pump
would need to be made.

Next time you change coolant, you might want to check it out.
