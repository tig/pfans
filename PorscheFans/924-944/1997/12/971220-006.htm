Joe,

When I bought my Turbo it was already leaking badly.  When I switched to 
Mobil 1 it leaked much more.  I was considering just hanging an IV bag of 
Mobile 1 over the engine fill tube.

I understand that motors that have not had synthetic run in them will 
leak  when it is introduced.  I have no experience going the other way 
once Mobil 1 was used.

I bit the bullet and started replacing all leaking seals and gaskets.  
Mine would leak when parked and produce a small pool under the car where 
rowdy oil eating bacteria would vacation and leave trash everywhere.  

Your seal, if I understand the problem correctly, can be replaced with 
the engine in place.  However, you need to remove the cam and balance 
belts first.  So I would replace all rollers and seals as well.  Be 
forewarned that the seal might not be the real source of your leak, so 
inspect everything carefully.

The above repair will take you a full day and require the P9201 belt 
tensioning tool and all the other associated goodies that go with it.  
Farming it out might cost you $300 to $500 (or more) depending on who 
does the job.  That might pay for all the tools if you do it yourself!  
And you will still need to have the belts retensioned in 1500 miles.  
Most shops charge additional charges to do that.

Some hints:

To successfully track oil leaks, it is absolutely necessary to first 
clean ALL oil residue off the engine if you want to find the source.  I 
used cans of cheap carburetor cleaner, rags, and even Q tips to clean all 
surfaces, cracks, and seams.  You may have to repeat the procedure 
several times to be sure where things leak.

Once everything is devoid of oil you can follow oil leaks with relative 
certainty.  The only thing you must watch out for is the high cohesion 
factor of oil causes it roll along surfaces and protrusions that you 
would not expect.  It will even seem to flow up hill sometimes.

Chasing oil leaks requires patients and fortitude.  I spent a lot of time 
repeating the above procedures to get all of my leaks solved.

Good luck and I hope you win the war with the oil fairy.

Hello P-Fans
	This year I had the chance to attend a few World SportsCar GT-1 races. While
Hans Stuck is a very nice person - the "common knowlede" is that he is fast in
any car but is very hard on the equipment! When Hans steps into a race car he
will tear up the gearbox and brakes in just a few laps. There are quite a few
drivers just as fast Hans Stuck, but are not as hard on the car. Hurley
Haywood, Alan McNish come to mind, they could be in a car for hours and the
car is in perfect shape. Perhaps this is why his contract was not renewed?
