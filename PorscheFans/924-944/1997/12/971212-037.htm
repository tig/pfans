I was just browsing Powerhaus's web site (what's with their prices
$$$?), and I came upon this performance package they offer for the 968
and 944 S2:

   "PH 3.0L 16V turbo pistons and rods: 4 custom PH racing pistons with
lightweight
      forged wrist pins, designed for the 16V cylinder head; 4 custom
Carrillo
      connecting rods
    PH racing preparation of crank, block, and pan (for ultimate engine
longevity)
    PH polished stainless steel header/collector, catalytic bypass
(optional) and muffler
    PH / KKK Turbocharger and oil/water plumbing
    PH custom aluminum Intercooler and custom aluminum boost plumbing
    PH custom aluminum Oil Cooler with braided lines
    PH Lightweight Performance Clutch package
    PH Cylinder head: full valve job, o-ring, port & polish
    Complete engine gasket set, complete bearing set
    All new cooling hoses and boost hoses
    PH Motronic injection system, Mass Flow, chips, and injectors
    LABOR to install 3.0L kit, including complete overhaul, R&R engine,
dyno tune

Project total: $18,000"

To quote part of the text that appears next:

"The output of the 3.0L 16V Turbo engine is guaranteed to be in excess
of 400 hp, with equivalent torque. These are the same results Porsche
achieves with the 1996 Twin Turbo."

But for the money they want for this job you could easily buy another
S2!

But when you consider that a 993 Twin Turbo costs over $100k, and you
can buy an S2 and make it just as fast for less than the cost of the S2
when it was a brand new car only 5-6 years ago, or less than the cost of
a new Boxster, I suppose from a certain light it could be worth it....
But still, 18 grand is 18 grand!

For what it's worth,

Christopher Barry

87' 951 silver/beige and purchased for less than half of 18 grand...
80' 924 white/beige ready to drive to the junk yard...
