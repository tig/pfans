If we are raising the ride height of a car we are by necessity raising the
frame and body from the cars suspension. You can raise it buy using a higher
pressure shock, going to coil over and raising the lower spring perch, or by
taking the shock off and placing a jack at the point where the top of the
shock attaches. All of these means are applying upward pressure on the upper
point where the shock attaches...the frame. Your example of placing jacks
under both rear wheels and jacking up will only measureably increase
negative camber if we some how chain the frame down so that it won't rise.
