To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere…),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had tons
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too… after all, the way the police is checking now a days it's
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny –
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones either
(look mom, no hands… look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can get
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with our
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know…

Vaughn,

My source on heat dammage as the cause of the rubber center failure is 1)it is
my mechanic's opinion, 2)Porche AG must to some extent agree when they added
the cooling mechanism to the 993, and 3) the cooling duct that I have has
stopped the rubber center failure. I know my prior clutch replacements were
too frequent, but with two drivers participating in 12-15 autocrosses/time
trials a year, that is a lot of heat build up.
The idea for a posting on the topic is good. I will work on an article for my
local PCA region rag (Windblown Witness) and reprint it to the list.
