>The truth is, the Centerforce disk is made to reduce these effects, as I=

soon
found out. It actually feels great. By "racy" I meant that you can FEEL
that
it's metal. Kind of hard and springy when the car is cold, but pleasingly=

giving as the metal springs warm. Another thing is performance.
My little 83 NA can really shoot out at a light. I've found that holding
the
clutch in and reving up to 2K, the car "hums" slightly, but LESS than it
used
to with the rubber centered. That was more of a roar.
<


My .02 on clutch replacement.  Recently I blew the clutch on our S2 at a
time trial.  The rubber center on the disc was ok but the friction pad on=

the pressure plate side came completely off.  I ordered the upgraded Sach=
s
disc from Jason at Paragon.  I had it in my hands and was ready to instal=
l
it.  However my engine builder (I can redesign this) wasn't happy with it=
=2E =

He pointed out that the spring center looked ok but the friction portion
was the same as the old disc.  There is a layer of friction material on
each side riveted to the marcel (wavy spring pieces of metal).  He pointe=
d
out the last one had blown up and I didn't want to do another clutch job.=
 =

He and the rice burner builder said we could not blow up a sintered bronz=
e
paddle wheel disc.  =


Kevlar was out as we had had a previous bad experience (slipping) with th=
e
bozo at Clutch Specialities with Kevlar for my 951.  They said the paddle=

wheel was grabbier, would not slip and would not fall apart.  Basically
they were right.  What no one knew was that the increased grab would set =
up
a hopping oscillation of the transaxle.  I changed the right motor mount
which had separated.  There was little improvement.  I got a transaxle
mount from George B. (Prince of Parts) and cast it in soild 85 durometer
urethane.  This helped some but now the transaxle noise was transmitted
through the frame.  Whoever said a transaxle sounds like dragging chains
knew what he was talking about.  There was a reason for the P car enginee=
rs
designing that floating rubber transaxle mount.  The clutch works fine
except for starting.  If I wanted a rabbit, I would of bought a VW.  The
transaxle hop will never make the top ten in the charts if I have a vote.=


Bottom line, in the number of hours that I have screwed with this trying =
to
stop the osculation, I could of put in another clutch.  Paddle wheels
belong on riverboats not 944s.  Use performance parts that have been trie=
d
and are known to work.  Now I have to pull the clutch again and put in th=
e
disc that I wanted in the first place.  Sooner or later I am going to lea=
rn
to stop experimenting, at least with Porsches.  Being the first to try
something isn't worth a damn if it doesn't work.
