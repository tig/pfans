Well, I sucessfully followed the procedure and replaced the digital
clock light in my '86 951.  I turned the car on and it lit up
beautifully.  It's a very nice irridescent blue, quite striking.  Only
problem is the clock is still blank.  What do I do?  There are no
numbers or even hint of numbers.  I have a masters in EE (still have
trouble with VCR's though), so I can try to pull it apart, but I figure
you all might have a direction for me to go.  I know buying a new clock
is absurdly expensive, so I'm hoping to fix it.
The clock has a 4 pin connector.  I would guess 2 are power for the
light and 2 are for the clock.  Are they just 12V and ground lines?
(haven't checked)  Other than that I have no ideas other than tearing it
apart. Help.
