Hi there, cant decipher your email address so I'll send to whole list.
While I highly agree about replacing the water pump and timing belt, 1100
sounds way too high. I just had my belt done, and the total was about 120
labor, 50 parts. The water pump should be about 100 rebuilt or 300 new and
the labor should overlap. With a rebuilt pump, total shouldnt exceed 500. 
That said, if you do the timing belt, DEFINITELY replace the rollers with
new units. Also do the balance shaft belts and rollers at the same time.
One weak link could cause catastrophic damage. A freind with a NA 89 944
had her roller come apart, cut the timing belt, bent 8 valves and cost
2500!!!!!!!!!!! This is the weakest link in the whole car and you are wise
to be paranoid about the belts. They should be retensioned after about 1000
to 1500 miles, and if they whine a bit when new, thats normal. 
Anyway ,have fun, thats the idea.
