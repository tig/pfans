        I was on the way home from the shop today where it was determined
that my A/C clutch coil may be bad (blowing fuse), and saw a NAPA store. I
bought the Bosch 13913 O2 sensor.  If you have the time to respond, I was
wondering if there is any difficulty, or any precautions, to be aware of
when pulling the wiring harness out and re-snaking it for installation.
Interestingly enough, I have a strong feeling that my gas mileage actually
is better with the sensor out of the system. Even "stepped" acceleration
will be better than the embarrassment of diving ahead of someone into a
corner, only to watch their tail disappear as I sit sputtering waiting for
the idle to catch (a symptom that has completely cleared upon unplugging the
sensor).

        Also, I was under the car today looking at the A/C when I noticed
that the small hose that runs between the two sides of the steering rack was
unttached on one side.  What's up with this?  I pressed it back into place,
but am amazed that I could not tell anything was wrong - what is it??
