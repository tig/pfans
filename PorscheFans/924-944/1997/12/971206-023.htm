Hello P-nuts!

Here is a quick question.  I know that people have been running 225/50-16's
on the front and 245/45-16's on the rears of the standard wheels that came
with the later 944's and 951's.  And as I understand it these will work with
the 7" fronts and 8" rears.  But I recently read that there should be a .88
to 1.0 ratio of rim width to tire width.  This is to insure "proper sidewall
behaviour".  Some quick math shows that with the standard tires (205's ft,
225's rr)  the ratio is .867 and .903 respectively.  The ratio gets worse
with the wider tires, .790 and .829.  

I am planning on upgrading my rubber in the spring but now not sure I want
to go with the wider tires.  Anyone with wider tires on the stock rims care
to comment on the "improper" sidewall behavior.  BTW I read this in a
catalog from Devek Performance (I know it's 928 stuff, but water-cooled
nonetheless).

Later,
Riff
