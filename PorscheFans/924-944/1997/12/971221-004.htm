Yes!!!!  I think that as a collective we represent a group that PCNA wants 
to keep happy.  We represent the future owners of their product and are 
very passionate about those products.  Don't hesitate to let them know that 
you are one of over 1000 members of a Porsche owners group and that they 
will be hearing from many of us about this CD.  It does not hurt that if 
they sold the CD to each of us for $100  they could make a quick $100,000 
(and we represent a small portion of the computer literate porschefiles who 
would want one of these).  This does not even address the efficiencies that 
could be had by their dealers if we all knew the exact part number of the 
product that we were ordering, preventing parts employees from having to 
look them up and eliminating errors.  Sounds like a great business 
proposition for everyone.  And don't tell them but I would pay $200 for the 
CD!
