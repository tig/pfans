Greetings and all the very best Xmas and 1998 from down under folks.

Has anybody on this list gone to the trouble of calculating their motion
ratio's etc for a 944 S2 / 951 ?  I would be interested to hear your
feedback on what suspension frequencies you consider are good for a track
set-up Vs a road set up.  I am in the 'off season' here and will be fine
tuning my spring set up for next years season and thought there might be
some other 'slide rulers' out there who like to find that elusive ground
between the 'numbers', the 'stop watch' and the 'seat of your pants'  where
everything works 'just right'.

Even if you haven't gone to this trouble I would love to hear from S2 / 951
owners who run their cars on the track (particularly 951 racecars) to get an
insight of what you use for your set up (private email if you don't want to
broadcast to your competitors).  I have had a few valuable inputs so far and
am just looking for more understanding full well that set up can be very
much a personal preference.
