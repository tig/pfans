Can anyone comment on the subject line?  My new S2 doesn't have LSD and =
it
really needs one.  I'm thinking of installing a Quaife, which should be
similar to what comes standard on the '94 plus 968.  My local shop says
the best way to go if I get a Quaife is for them to pull the trans (or I
could), and they would ship it to a firm in Bend, OR that has all the
expen$ive tools and charges very reasonable labor (if you call $800-1000
reasonable... I guess it is for the amount of work).

Thanks,

<<    I am thinking about getting a 1988 or 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo S
      for track events here in the northeast.  It would not be seriously 
      raced, but rather for some fun.  Can anyone please explin this model's
      performance specs (0-60, max hp & torque, etc.),  and also the
      differences between the Turbo and Turbo S models?  Are either of these 
      reliable enough for weekend track events (with proper maintenance)
      or are they very delicate and tend to fall apart?
      I know these are general questions but if you could provide any insite
      it will be appreciated.  Thank you very much.
       >>>>

I have an 88 Turbo S, which is essentially the same as the 89 Turbo (the S
designation was dropped in 89, but all 89 Turbos had the S specs).  I use it
for daily commuting and about a dozen track events per year, also in the
Northeast (LRP, WGI, NHIS).  Here's some basic info on the differences between
the two flavors of  951.  It's not authoritative; I think more info is
available on the 944 FAQ.

0-60 has been reported anywhere from mid 5's to low 6's in test reports I've
read, although in the real world anything in the 5's would be hard to
duplicate without abusing the drivetrain, since there's not much torque
available from this motor until the engine revs rise and the turbo spools up.
HP is rated at 247 (vs. 217 for the regular turbo).  I'm afraid I don't
remember the exact torque rating, and don't have a reference handy, but I
recall it's in the 230-250 range.  Suffice to say, on the cam and with the
boost up, it's a rocket.  Claimed top speed is 162 mph, vs. about 155 for the
non-S model.  The additional power is achieved primarily through the use of a
revised turbocharger unit and different DME mapping.

Other performance features unique to the "S", and relevent to your question
regarding track use,  include:
--single-adjustable Koni struts/shocks, with threaded front spring perches for
ride height              
       adjustment
--somewhat stiffer springs/torsion bars
--heavier front anti-sway bar (28.6mm)
--bigger brakes (same units as on 928 S4)
--limited slip differential as std equip.
--hardened 1st and 2nd gearsets
--cooling loop on transaxle
--add'l reinforcement to the front of the chassis
--16x7 front and 16x9 rear forged alloy wheels (225/50 and 245/45 tires,
respectively)

951's make terrific track cars right out of the box, and the S model of 88 and
all 89's make especially good ones, owing to the enhanced standard performance
features (there are also additional standard luxury features, which I haven't
addressed here -- such as 8-way power seats, upgraded sound system, etc. --
which don't do a thing but hurt performance by adding weight).  THey're a
blast to drive on the track -- fast and surefooted, yet challenging to drive
quickly.  If well maintained, they are very durable track cars, especially
given the high levels of performance they are capable of achieving.  The cars
were designed to be driven hard and engineered as a balanced package, where
acceleration, top speed, braking, cornering and durability are all addressed
in relatively equal proportions.  That's not to say they don't have weaknesses
-- the FAQ covers them pretty thoroughly.  However, in a full season of hard
charging at a dozen track events and 15,000 street miles, I've had no problems
with mine, other than needing to replace the clutch due to failure of the
throwout bearing (the grease had dried up).

Another consideration with these cars is that a significant increase in
horsepower and torque is available by acquiring aftermarket performance chips
(DME and boost control).  The downside of using them is that you may bring on
more problems (eg, blown head gaskets, #2 rod bearing failure, etc).  This is
an opinion, not a fact, but one shared by others on this list, I believe.
Some disagree that there's any disadvantage (especially if you use racing
gas), and others acknowledge there's a downside, but figure "what the hey,"
the extra kick in the butt is a blast, so it's worth it!   One nice thing
about the "S" version is you get 30 additional hp with no apparent downside
(at least I've not seen or heard any evidence that a stock "S" is less
reliable than standard turbo).

Hope this helps with your decision.  Let me know if you want more info.
