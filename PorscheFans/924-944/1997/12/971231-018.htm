There is someone here locally who is doing just that in his 89 951.  We'll
see how it goes, if he beats me, I'll consider doing it :)

Some of the documentation I've read says that the Euro gears were different,
but all the people I spoke to in Germany say it's the same because their
cars top out at the same speeds as ours.  The gearing that is supposed to
be in there would make it a 145mph car, but that sounds ridiculously low for
the Autobahn back in the hay-days.

I don't think SCCA will allow a non-shifter kart in.  My local region will
not, under any circumstances, allow karts into autocrossing.  Our parking
lots in B.C. are quite small, which is why S2's are soooo much quicker than
the turbo.  When we go to Washington to run, we find that our turbos do much
better.  Bill Buetow is still faster in his S2 of course, but at least we're
close.

>Fastest around here is an SP Talon AWD, in Montreal, a '73 911 3.2.

When I said fastest, I meant in the 944 line.  Our fastest car here is 
actually a 3.0L 914 on slicks usually driven by Mike Elsinga.  Other
notable cars are Stu Rulka in his Morgan 8, my Talon used to be in the top
5 when it was running :) and Doug Bayley is usually in the top 10 in his
gutted race Mustang.  In the last while, I've noticed that more and more
street racers are coming into auto-x which is good for the sport, but
boring for the spectators.  There's only so many Neons I can take with
their high-strung nail-on-a-blackboard exhaust note going through an
autocross without lifting once :)  Or the Civics that think they need
downforce to make it from home to school in the morning, and then
show up at an autocross and get protested into MOD class because they
have aftermarket wings :)  Look what you've done now, got me all worked
up :)

One other car I should mention for the above fastest in our region would
be my competitor Pat Ma in his 911TT.  On street tires, he regularly places
in the top 10 fastest!  Wes and Paul both are usually nipping at the top
10, off by a tenth or two in most cases.
