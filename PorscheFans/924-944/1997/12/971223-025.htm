   You may have more than one problem but try tightening one or both
universal joints on the steering column. Mine had an awful knocking
transmitted through the steering wheel. Tightening the u joints fixed
it. You get to the upper one by handing your wrench to your 3 year old
and inserting his/her hand underneath the brake booster. Only my upper
joint needed tightening but to get to the lower one its probably
easiest to remove the air box and go in from the top.

   If you went to wider tires the "jerk" maybe due to tramlining.
Otherwise I'd suspect tie rods, also it will be improved with new
suspension bushings.
