The all leather option that you mentioned seemed a bit pricey.  I would suggest shopping 
around if you choose to restore to OEM original.  Otherwise I personally would go with 
just replacing the one cracked panel.  

I did this myself about a week ago in Wichita, KS.  Stylecraft Auto Upholstry created a 
new vinyl panel and inserted it into the original driver's lower seat cushion cover for 
me.  The rebuilt cover thus had a new center part but all of the side parts were 
original.  Total carry-out cost was less than $100.  Leather instead of vinyl would have 
been maybe $175 more.  

I had removed the seat myself (6 allen-headed bolts holding seat tracks to floor and two 
wire harnesses to unplug).  Cycle the seat all the way up before taking out.  Then 
simply bend back the metal spikes around the seat frame edges and use side cutters to 
clip the hog rings elsewhere.  The cover pops right off.  Take it to the upholstry shop 
and a couple of days later go get it back.  Buy a hog ring plier and a box of hog rings 
at the local Coast-to-Coast hardware store for under $10 and reverse the process.  If I 
can do it, then anyone can.

The vinyl looks very good and only an expert would be able to tell the difference.  
Remember that even new leather would look a bit different than the original since the 
original has aged and stretched.  New leather has a soft, semi-dull look whereas the old 
original leather typically has become shiny and hard.  Since it is going to look 
slightly different anyway, why not go with the cheaper but just as durable vinyl?

Good luck,
