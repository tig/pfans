In germany it's the 1st of April for making such sort of jokes....

Think about some racing series. For exaple ITC the former DTM 
(Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft). They got about 450 hp out of a 2.5
l
engine (over 10000 RPM)....but this was a racing car !!!! (Bill it was a
M3 :-)) ) 
The cost of a engine like this 
was about 35000 $. Another problem..how should a normal engine handle
more than 9000 RPM's
(I dont't know the exact english expression) because of the different
weights of pistons and 
crankshaft.
Why should porsche add a expensive thing like variocam to the 968 in
purpose of
getting some hp if it's easy like that....
