Hello:
     I read our posting today and since I'm considering changing over to 
synthetic I've been reading on the types of oil that should be used. I 
doubt that a 30 weight would be a good option, especially for the high 
compression that the engines run and on older engines with wear. I judge 
that 40 weight should be the minimum, and 50 or even 60 weight would be 
reasonable for hard driving. Happy Holidays to All.

Hi guys,

I went out to my 86 944Turbo and started the car to go to a meeting and turned
on the AC and nothing happened. The compressor didn't kick in and the lights
on the dash didn't come on (neither the light for the AC or the light for the
recirculated air button). I looked at the radio and the whole digital face
turned to 8's so I think I have a major electrical problem. Car starts and
runs but I came home and parked it. Any ideas???????

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

P.S. Please reply to me and the list as I don;t always get the digest.
