Good question, I wonder what the consensus is.  When I installed the D40
M2s on my 944S, I waited until the little raised dots on the tread had
been worn before I got really aggressive. While waiting for the dots to
dissappear I took the car on long rides and tried to avoid hard braking or
turning.  In effect, I was heat cycling the tires, trying not to get them
out of round while doing that.  After about 200 miles, the raised dots
were gone, at which point I went for another ride fully exercising the
tires and got this smile on my face that nothing could wipe off. 

YMMV.
