Hello Bob,

Generally, no. If your CV joints are worn to the point of making
an audible click, then they are too worn for repacking. Think of
repacking the CV grease as a preventative measure. If your engine
started knocking because the bearings were worn, changing the oil
would not stop the knock. You should repack your CV joints BEFORE
they start to click.

That said, you may be able to change the orientation of the CV joint, 
repack it with fresh grease, and use it for a long time. Since the
joints tend wear in one direction (since you usually go forward),
changing the orientation of the cv joint will probably allow you to
get a lot more miles from it.

It all depends on how much money and/or time you have. Obviously, the
easiest thing to do is take it to your shop and have them replace all
the joints. If you have no money, but a few hours, you can remove both
axles, disassemble the 4 CV joints, clean them, reassemble them, repack
with grease and install them in the car.  That will cost about $15 for
grease, but will take you around 4 - 6 hours if this is your first time
and you're using hand tools.

It's a fairly straightforward operation. Most of the details are
included in a FAQ. You can do this one by yourself.

good luck,
