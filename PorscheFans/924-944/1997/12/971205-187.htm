	Well, here's one for the books.  Tonight, the window
washer pump (which has not been in use in two years)
separated from its moorings and, apparently, slipped
underneath the headlamp.  When I turned off the lights the
headlamp came down on the pump.  Once I figured all this
out, and realized that my headlamp motor was fine, I was
relieved.  However, the force of the crunch has left the
passenger side headlamp out of sync. slightly, in that it
protrudes from the front about a quarter of an inch in the
fully closed position.  I imagine this will cause me to
lose ground in the 140mph race home on the interstate, and
it will certainly annoy me forever.  I assume brute force
needs to be applied somewhere - any help out there??
