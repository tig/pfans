Number one son says he'd like to buy number two son a set of car horns =
for
his 944 Turbo as a belated Christmas present.  What works well in a 944?
We're thinking of the dual tone Hella units sold by many mail order =
firms.
It looks like they come with a relay.  Do you really need it and do these
horns fit OK?  Any other recommendations appreciated.  We're looking for
something that will get the normally lame driver's attention before they
crash into our cars :-)

Thanks and Merry Christmas,

I'm just getting around to belts and things on my 87 924S and noticed some
clear viscous oil hanging from the ac compressor belt at the pulley. There is
no oil on the belts or above, so I have only two theories as to the source.
1. The last time this car was run before being disabled and trucked from the
bay area to seattle, my sister had put some engine oil in it and spilled some
by the filler. It could have been blown up along the bottom of the engine
during the trip up.
2. There is oil in the clutch/bearing assembly which has leaked out while the
car has been sitting.
Does anyone know if there is any such oil in this thing, and are there seals
which can be replace? The belt seems absolutely dry of oil except at the
bottom, so I cannot imagine it was brought there by the belt, especially
considering the thickness of the oil (seems about like engine oil, and its
still clear-amber). 
Any thoughts?
