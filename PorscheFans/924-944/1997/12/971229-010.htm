Thanks for the reply, Adam, this helps make sense of things. Kinda like
around here, were there is a persistence in designing using English
units, in spite of the fact that most of our suppliers and all of our
customers use metric (I'm in semiconductors), resulting in continual
conversions...

Now I have a new question for the list: Why do I suddenly have
coolant in my intake??? I've never seen this before ('77 924), or heard of
this, but the usual oil in my intake has been very recently joined by my
coolant (at least now I know where it's going!), resulting in a layer of that
beautiful brown sludge I'm too familiar with! We're talking puddles here,
folks. I don't have any oil in my coolant (when I have coolant in my
expansion tank - I found this out while trying to figure out where my 
coolant was going), or condensation/sludge under my oil cap, and the
engine's performance doesn't seem to be any worse than usual, but
could my head gasket be blown anyway? Could there be anything else
that could cause this (I do know my valve seals are shot)?

If this does turn out to be a head gasket, can anyone tell me if the
procedure for this engine is much different than other OHC engines? I've
done them (head gaskets, that is) on a Diesel Rabbit (closest point of
reference) and Triumph TR7 (actually a few times on that one - down to
under four hours R+R on that car! ;)...

TIA
