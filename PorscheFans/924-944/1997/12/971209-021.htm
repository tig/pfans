Actually, Bill, there are a lot more secrets to S2 tuning that I didn't
mention.  I was planning on getting in touch with you to see if your
company would like to be the exclusive supplier of some of these products -
at a modest fee, of course.  I figure we could really make a bundle. For
example, last time at track, I ran studded snow tires, and they really
improve traction, particularly on cars w/out an LSD.  The other drivers
complained about holes in the asphalt, but I think we could circumvent this
potential problem with some cash to the right PCA officials.  We could
market 245/45 custom studded snow tires on magnesium 3-piece wheels as part
of the camber adjustment package. But that's enough for now - don't want
too many of these gems floating around in cyberspace.
