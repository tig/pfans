Hi  Dhruv,

>Well my question is about the dash
>lights being dim.

There was some discussion on the List about this once before. Can't really
recall whether the lights could be brightened or not, but I think the 'dim'
lights are standard. Personally, I prefer the dask lights as dim as
possible as there is far less distraction when driving (the eye is not
confused or weakened by lights in car that are brighter than those out -
the eye will adjust to the brightest source). Also, I hardly ever use the
instruments (warning lights are bright enough), preferring to drive by
feel... good training for the track!!

>My final question has to do with hard driving.  I notice a 'rotton egg'
>type of smell when I drive the car 'hard'.

Again, there has been recent discussion. It's a by-product of the catalytic
converter (some mentioned that changing the brand of gas you buy might
help). I notice it on my car too, but will be removing the cat soon
(they're not required here in New Zealand).

Cheers, Gary
