  Mine will be at the upholterers next week for a new interior. Picked
out colors this morning. I'm not going to try to match factory interior
though. I've selected all vinyl seating surfaces, its a leather like
vinyl. Very supple Hard to tell its not leather. New carpeting. And the
lower door panels will be dyed to match the seats. Seats will be a dark
"red maple" similar to the brown dash but more reddish. Carpet will be
a similar color but a couple shades lighter. We'll see how it turns
out. After I see what it looks like I'll let you know what I paid for
it. ;-)
