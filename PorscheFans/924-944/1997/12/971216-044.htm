Since I couldn't decipher the header for a return address,(people should
really put their email addresses in the letter when asking for a response)
I'll send this to the group.
To Marc Lucterhand:
First, welcome to the Bay Area, now go home! Were full!!!!
(Just Kidding) Really, welcome. There are literally dozens of good Porsche
mechanics, on top of three dealerships within driving distance. I can
recommend two based on personal experience. C.T. Automotive in Campbell(
Campbell seems to have a plethora of autoshops) is a good all around shop
but seems to specialize in 911 models. I have noticed a few instances where
they were misinformed about waterpumpers. 
The shop I swear by is called Precision Performance, also in Campbell.(In
case you dont know, Campbell is bordered by San Jose, Los Gatos, Saratoga,
and a stones throw from Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale) The shop is owned by a
former dealership mechanic who specialized in the watercooled models for 15
years. He has all the Porsche training certificates, and you can ask him
any minute detail and he'll know the answer. I sent three freinds to him
and every repair so far has been flawless. The nice thing is he's the only
one there so you know he'll be working on the car himself and since he's
the owner, you know he's going to do the job right. And, if you ask nice,
he'll let you bring in your own parts. The funny part about how I found him
was that I wanted a second opinion on my clutch, and looking in the phone
book, I picked him cause his phone number ended in 944.(silly I know.)
Anyway, I hope you make a lot of $$$$$ cause the sticker shock on housing
here compared to N.Carolina can kill someone not prepared! I do think this
is Porsche heaven though, I've never seen as many nicely maintained cars
anywhere else in the country. And the Golden Gate Region of the PCA has
something over 1200 members and lots of activities. 
Feel free to mail me if you have any questions.
