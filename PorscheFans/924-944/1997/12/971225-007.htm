I bought an aftermarket boost gauge I am installing and have a question
about the electrical hookup.  I have three leads: ground, power, and
lights.  The power should come on with ignition and the lights with the
parking lights.

I would like to know how to identify which wire to hook these to and the
best way to attach them.  The kit came with connectors where you insert
wire from boost unit and wire to tap from in two holes and mash
together, it pushes a little metal slide through both the wires so that
they are connected.  I would like to hook them up a the fuse box as the
box lifts out for easy access to the wires underneath but it is hard to
tell which wires are which on the bottom side.  Thanks in advance for
any help.
