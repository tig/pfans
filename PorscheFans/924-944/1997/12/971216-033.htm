I am not too familiar with the specific model that you are looking at. 
What I can tell you is that the seals on the 944 turbo will not dry out
requiring an engine rebuild after the car has been sitting for 2 months
which seems to be the case on many RX7s. If you really know how to work on
the rotary engine and have the time for it, an RX7 may be right for you.
While the 944 models may be picky about their belts and their abused
clutches, the engines will also last over 100k miles without smoking or
needing rebuilds, if not 200k miles.  The 944 also has a galvanized steel
body which will resist rust much better than the RX7 will.

good luck.

John Pohl wants to know the spring rate of the stock Turbo S front springs: 

I had them tested at Eibach here in Califonia, and they measured 27.6
nm/mm=157.63 lb./in. Not too stout, and the first thing to replace on a track
car.  

As far at the consistant vs inconsistant wire diameter and the spec book
saying part number 944 xxx xxx xx was fitted in production.  I believe this is
incorrect.  All Turbo S' that I have worked on or seen, came standard with
height adjustable front suspension and came fitted with part number
951.343.531.03 front springs. These are consistant in wire diameter
(thickness). You cannot fit standard 944 non-height adjustable springs on the
Turbo S, as the upper and lower spring perches are different sizes.

The 968 030 front springs are a good upgrade if can't handle the 415lb spring
rate of the Turbo Cup springs.  

About the disscussion regarding the PowerHouse 3.0 16v turbo:
 >> "PH 3.0L 16V turbo pistons and rods: 4 custom PH racing pistons with
lightweight>>      forged wrist pins, designed for the 16V cylinder head; 4
custom
Carrillo<<

Before you guys get too involved in this fantasy, ask them how many of these
exact  motors they have done and ask for specific references. I'll bet you
won't be getting any customer phone numbers or dyno sheets on that one. 18K is
a lot of money to be the guinea pig on that one.  


Best regards and happy motoring,

Yes, it does on the CIS system. There is a book entitled 'Bosch Fuel =
Injection Systems which gives a thorough explanation of how all Bosch =
systems function, from the L,K, & CIS injections systems thru Motronics. =
You might also want to check that your injectors are not leaking.
You might want to post e-mail on the 924/944 page as well.

There is, NO SUBSTITUTE!!!

Hello P-Fans
	There are only so many components, that can make your 928 use excessive fuel
and flood out. The first thing you should do is check the fuel system
pressure.  Since you have replaced the fuel damper, fuel pump (?), and the
fuel pressure regulator - that only leaves a few components left. I suspect
that the system pressure is sky high. This can be caused by the fuel return
line being restricted. There is a "check valve" either built into the fuel
pump or right before the pump, where the fuel return line goes into the fuel
tank. On 944's the check valves part number is: #944-608-951-00  $10, and
attaches inside of the fuel supply line just before the fuel pump. 
	On  most cars, the fuel pressure regulator fails intermittently, since the
regulator is mounted on the return side of the fuel rail, this can cause the
fuel pressure to go sky high as well. The coolant temp sensor(s) could be bad.
There are usually two sensors on CIS cars. One is a basic sensor, the other is
usually called a 80% switch. The 80% switch would also be a likely suspect for
a overly rich running engine. The air flow sensor plate height could be out of
adjustment. A vacuum leak could also cause a overly rich running engine.
