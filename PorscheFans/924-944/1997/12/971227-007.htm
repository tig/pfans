My heartfelt thanks to the person who earlier this fall told the tale of their
new rear main seal leaking due to residue stuck on the wall of the sealing
surface. I just replaced mine, and may not have otherwise noticed the little
voids in the sides of the old seal (not the part that goes against the crank).
The little bits of old seal were stubbornly fused to the machined sides of the
crankcase. Had I not noticed this it surely would have leaked, and getting to
that seal is a HUGE job. Even though this is really a basic mechanical
practice (making sure that the surface is clean) it should perhaps be in the
faq, since it is more than likely typical, hard to see if you are not looking
for it, and an incredible hassle if not taken care of the first time. This
list is a terrific thing. Thanks to all who contribute

I have a 86 944 turbo. I have been hearing a ticking noise from the rear of
the car that only occurs when the car is in gear and increases as i increase
the speed. The car shifts and runs fine and iam not getting any noise or
problems with the transmission. It also comes and gos.....any ideas.
