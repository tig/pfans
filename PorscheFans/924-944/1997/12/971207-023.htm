About 6 months ago, I put 245/45-16 and 225/50-16 on 8J and 7J rims.  I
had a similar concern, but went ahead and did it anyway.  The tires work
great;  I checked with the "Tire Rack" people, from whom I purchased the
tires, and they said the tires are okay for these rims.  Also, the guy
who sits next to me had a 90 944S2 and did the same;  unfortunately,
after a series of expensive repairs he finally sold the car, and became
a traitor by buying an 850 BMW.

If you find out there is a safety risk involved with this rim/tire
issue, please post it.

Also - for anyone with an 944S2, how has your car been to you?   If you
care to share info, please feel free to email me, or just post it.  

Regards,
Ed

During the warm up period the engine will miss terribly for aprox. 3
seconds right after any upshift exceeding 3000 rpm. It`s almost gone
when the engine has completely warmed up but still noticeable. I have
replaced the cap, rotor, plugs, wires, coil,O2 sensor. Checked: fuel
pressure(while driving), injector spray pattern and volume, speed and
ref. sensor clearance(tryed swapping too), airflow meter for resistance
and binding, temp sensors, throttle switches. The engine idles as smooth
as silk (no CO, 50ppm HC Post Catalytic). On a slightly loaded dyno at
aprox. 2500rpm and up, CO climbs to 3.5% HC to 800 ppm and the whole
time the O2 sensor is reading lean(.2V) It`s missing! But WHY? Has
anyone seen this before, Does anyone know how the DME times the interval
between coil firings (I`m assuming it counts ring gear teeth but it just
seems too vague). I would really really appreciate any input on this
before I pull out anymore hair or go out and buy a new DME Box.  Dave

Hello P-Fans & Dave
	Check your Spark Plug Wires for the missfire. Take some glass cleaner or wet
them down with an old sprayer bottle. Look closely to the inner hood foam -
usually the foam loosens here and the spark plug wires touch and arch or
ground out there. It helps if you wet down the plugs in total darkness - ei at
night. If the tach needle stays steady when you feel the "miss" then it
usually a primary ignition side of things. But - If the "miss" is felt and the
tach needle move down slightly with the miss - it is usually caused by a fuel
problem. ie: spray pattern, carbon build up ect... Do not forget to check the
"set screw" that holds down the rotor to the distributor shaft - you should
use low strength loctite (Blue) on the set screw's threads. 

								Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com
