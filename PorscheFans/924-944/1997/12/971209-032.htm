Well, now that we have had all the REALLY funny postings about how to =
get more performance from a S2, does anyone have any serious =
recommendations? I know I could also replace the rear of my car with a =
jet-turbine from a F-16, but I was kind of looking suggestions that are =
a little more serious.

As mentioned, I have heard of chips for the S2s - does anyone have any =
experince with these?

Thanks,
