Pfans:

        1. My mechanic checked the rattling sound that I thought could be my
torque tube going bad or the typical tranny noise, and found that one of the
bolts on the collar was very loose and he tightened it and I now have a very
pleasingly quiet car.

        2. Changed the bulbs behind the dash and have beautiful light,
enough to make the rheostat useful.

        3. Just got a chip from George B. on consignment and it seems to
help. The car seems to rev mor freely and has greater torque throuhout the
power curve. I don't know about the top end. This is a very subjective
judgment and it's possible there's no difference but the difference I wish
there would be. Is there a place in south Florida where I could get the car
dynoed?
