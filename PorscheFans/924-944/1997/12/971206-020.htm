To Alex Chiu, 
    I started to respond by sending Alex a personal e-mail concerning his
balance shaft 
belt failure but, this is something that all 924/944/968 owners need to
know. It has long been a misconception among our ranks that as long as you
replaced the timing and balance shaft belts every 30000 miles you are okay.
That is not necessarily true. Age of the belt is as much a determining
factor in when to replace the belts as is mileage. The original
recommendation from Porsche for belt replacement was every 45000 miles.
When a large number of cars started experiencing belts failures at just
over 30000 miles. Therefore, Porsche revised the recommendation to every
30000 miles. Many owners take a long period of time to put 30000 miles on
there cars and therefore the belts will break due to age (dry rot) before
the 30000 miles is reached. I don't know if it is an official Porsche
recommendation, but most places that I've talked to and the shop that I
worked with for a period of time now recommend every 3 years or 30000 miles
- which ever comes first. If you follow these guidelines, barring incorrect
installation, you should have no more problems with premature belt failure.
