Steve,
      The hose you are referring to on the power steering rack, mine was loose 
as well, and I have never seen any fluid leak from it. It obviously can't be 
for high pressure as it is press fit, I haven't payed much attention to it.. 
Perhaps it is for lubrication purposes, or it helps scavenge fluid which leaks 
past some seal?

Good Luck,
          Ezra

Steve,
      It was a bit difficult to remove the old O2 sensor. I used lots of WD40, 
and a large crescent wrench. There really isn't any room for an O2 sensor 
socket unless you drop the exhaust.. If the large wrench hadn't worked, I 
would have tried heating it with a torch. The wiring wasn't too hard to 
remove, you might want to pull a string or wire through while removing the 
wiring harness to make re-routing easier.
  I clipped the 13913 leads as close to the supplied connector as possible to 
maximize the length of the leads. I left a small length of wire leading from 
the old O2 sensor just in case I ever decide to do something with it in the 
future. I suggest staggering the length of the wires such that when the wires 
are soldered together, the joints do not touch. This prevents potential shorts 
from occuring if the heat shrink tubing I used to cover each joint happens to 
split or otherwise loose integrity. I pulled back the silicon/fiberglass heat 
resistant shroud as much as possible while soldering, and slid it back over 
the splices that I made when done. I used an 80Watt weller soldering iron and 
high quality rosin core solder, make sure the wires completely wet with 
solder, you don't want to do re-do it later due to a cold solder joint... Oh, 
I think there were two black wires and a white wire, or vice versa. The two 
wires of the same color can be connected either way, polarity does not matter.

Let me know how it goes!
Ezra
