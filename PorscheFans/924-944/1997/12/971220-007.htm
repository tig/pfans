In my recent inpection of the hatch release mechanism 
in the rear hatch underneth the carpet, I saw the motor
and detrermined that the pressing of the switch has no 
effect whatsover on the motor.  What could be wrong here?
Obviosly my hatch won't ever pop open if the motor and or
switch and or fuse doesn't work.  My car is an '86 944. 
I have checked the fuses and they appear to be working but
appartantly there is no specific fuse to control this
function.  I have already followed all of the past threads 
but they seem to just talk about alingment as opposed to
the working order of the motor and switch.  Any help would 
be greatly appreciated because although I don't care if 
this thing actually works, I just want to have my car in 
perfect working order.  Thanks.

Well, now that there is a thread going about seals, and as I am about to do a
belt and roller replacement, I guess I should ask, can the front end seals be
replace when this is happening without too much additional fuss (ie not having
to take apart the balance shaft housings) The car has 93K and does not seem to
be leaking, but since I'm here doing all this (water pump too) as preventive,
it seems prudent. I decided to go ahead and do the rear main seal why
replacing the damper plate, even though it does not leak at all, since I don't
expect to be in there again for another 90K miles, and I might not expect it
to last that long. The front end seals, however, I will have access to again
in another 30K miles if I am diligent. When hava any of you had them start to
leak on an always-dino oil engine (and planning to keep it that way) On a
related note, the new toothed rollers from vertex are a sort black plastic
composition material. Is this original (I have not taken the old ones off yet)
The smooth rollers I got from them are metal. The new toothed ones are made in
germany, and it looks like they would be to difficult to bother being
aftermarket manufactured, so my guess is they are the oem maker in a non-
porsche box. Anyone have any knowledge on this?
