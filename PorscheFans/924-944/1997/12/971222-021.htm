I have done business with Kempton Bros a number of times with mixed
results.

I purchased a 'rebuilt' transaxle. The transaxle turned out to be OK in
the long run, but the lube filler plug was frozen onto the case to the
point that I had to have a nut welded to the plug so it could be 'coaxed
out' by an impact wrench. It must have been sitting on the shelf for
ages. Thankfully, I discovered this prior to installation...

I purchased a set of used aluminum control arms. The control arms and
ball joints were OK, but the rear bushings were shot.

I purchased a number of trim pieces, such as side marker lights, that
were dirty but acceptable.
