Thanks to everyone that responded to my question about the Impala SS.

The general consensus was that it has 260 hp and 4200 lbs of weight to 
tow around.  It seems that, like so many of us, as we get older we put 
more and more weight on.  So, too, with the Impala.

I have heard 0 to 60 times of 6.5 seconds to 7.4.  The latter available 
on a WEB address given by one member.  The 7.4 is believable, but 6.5 
seems awful fast for 4200 lbs of automatic transmission on a diet of 260 
hp.

The 951S, at 247 hp, gets a claimed 0 to 60 from 5.5 to 5.7 depending on 
which Porsche writings you believe.

So the general consensus is the SS will be a bit slow, but not a bad car 
if you want/need a full size sedan that has a dash of sport thrown in for 
good measure.

Happy New Year Everyone!
