From what I understand the NGZ models were produced for Porsche in the
mid eighties, they are now out of business.
I have come across 3 of them. I have a 80's Red Carrera Cab, Red Carrera
Targa and white 944 Turbo. I found the white Turbo at a swap meet at
Lime Rock Park, got the red cab at EWA in NJ and a friend gave me the
red targa. I have been told they can be found mostly at swap meets now.
I would like to find as few more of these, they look great on my desk
:).

Regards

<< I think this same piece
 made out of aluminum or even mild steel would have weighed less than half as
 much.  Why would Porsche do this?  I suspect that, with attention to detail,
 Porsche could have saved several hundred pounds on each of my 968s without
any
 sacrifice in durability.  Or am I wrong here?

Cost.  The same part in aluminum would cost 10x as much.

<< I have a 86 944 turbo. I have been hearing a ticking noise from the rear of

Sounds like your CV joints.  Common practice is to pull the shafts, repack the
joints, and swap sides with the axles keeping the outside CV joints on the
outside.  This reverses the rotation of the CV joint and allows it to wear on
a different surface, effectively doubling the life of the joint.

 I can't say that this would work, but there has been a similar product out
 on the streets for quite a while for carb'd Harleys, >>


This would work on carburated and maybe throttlebody injected cars by helping
the fuel to vaporize better.  I seriously doubt that it would have any effect
whatsoever with our port-fuel injection.
