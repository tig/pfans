Mornin',

I think I am going to try my luck in local SCCA auto crossing this summer
with my "breathed" upon 924.  Any ideas on what type of cars I would be
competing against with a 1982 924 with modified exhaust and the FI system
removed and fitted with two 40mm DCOE Weber side drafts?

Heated mirror question.  I pulled apart my mirror assembly to repair the
electric motor units and I discovered that I have heated mirrors.  I have
not performed any electrical tests as of yet, I just know they do not work.
 How are these powered?  Are they always on?  Is there a temperature sensor
somewhere?

Thanks in advance,

Jay

The first of the '88 S models were available only with the Silver Rose
Metallic paint and color-coordinated interior, but later in the model year
they offered the S in all the standard color/interior combos.
