Hi, Claus and all,

I used Easy-Off on my wheels and I strongly recommend against it.  Yes,
it does remove the anodizing, but it also attacks the aluminum after the
anodizing is gone.  There's not much of an effect on smooth surfaces,
just a light patina that is easily removed.  However, roughly-machined
areas (between/behind the spokes, for example) are a different story. 
The Easy-Off attacks these areas much more vigorously, leaving extremely
hard deposits that are very difficult to remove.  I spent hours cleaning
up this mess.

If I had it to do over, I'd follow the advice that someone of the 911
list gave me.  He took one of his wheels to a local anodizer and had
them remove the anodizing.  They quoted $15, but ended up not charging
him.  He said they did an excellent job.
