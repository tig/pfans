Bill razzed him with:

Well today I put my girlfriends mountain bike in the back of the 944,
drove with the windows down, top off, and smiling faces through the
worse sunshine storm I've ever seen in my life.  If was horrible, I tell
you...blue skies, that obnoxious sunshine and warm air through my
hair...it was terrible.  So we get to my house, unload her bike and I
grab mine and we're off for a bike ride through the golf course and
local nature trail.  Oh, by the way, we wore shorts and were kinda
sweaty afterwards....Damn sunshine.  So, see how lucky you are to not
have to deal with all of this hell? Aren't you glad you live up north? 
;)

Chris Razzed Bill with:
From my lake front house in the 'North' its a ten minute drive to the local ski area in my 4wd while my 944 rests in the heated garage awaiting its winter rejuvenation.
I was skiing in the same sunshine you were enjoying.
Hey Bill - if your are interested the ski area is having a downhill mountain bike race on the slopes in January!!?!
