There are LOTS of 255's for 16" wheels. The problem is that they are
all 50 series aspect ratio. That will make the sidewall too high, and
will screw up the weight balance and handling of a car designed for
lower profile tires.

It all depends on how serious you are. There are a number of tires that
are great for the street and decent for the track. True, if you must go
as absolutely fast as you can, the street tire will not last too long.
However, if you slow down just a little, you can have a lot of fun on
the track, and not trash your street tires. The Bridgestone S-02, and
RE71, the Dunlop SP8000 and D40/M2, The Yokohoma AVS Intermediate,
and even the BFG ZR are all in that category. 

Conversely, if all you really care about is performance, there are a
number of tires that give a decent ride, and are very fast on the track.
The Yokohama A008 RS was great for that. Relatively quiet and
comfortable on the street, excellent on the track, almost as fast
as the BFG R1. I've heard the new Yoko A032R is also like that, although
not as good for the street, and not as fast as the RS, it is
supposed to last fairly long. Finally, the Toyo Proxes RA is another
track tire that gives a decent ride and lasts relatively long.

Because it costs a lot of money for two sets of wheels and tires. And it's
a pain to be constantly switching wheels. And you never seem to have the
right wheels on the car. Don't get me wrong, I would love to have a 
set of street tires. Just that at this stage, considering how I use the
car, it doesn't make a lot of sense for me.
