Marshall,

Don't Panic!  This is very normal.  The 944 clutch bleed syndrome makes a 
day in hell with all the devils instruments of torture seem like a picnic 
compared bleeding a 944 clutch!

Once you have all the air out of the line, close the nipple.  I tied a 
rope to the clutch pedal and used that to pull the pedal back each time I 
depressed it.

Just keep pumping, and pumping, and pumping, and pumping, and pumping.  
Once you have pumped it a few thousand times (so it seems), switch feet 
and do it a few more thousand times.  Soon, in about three or four weeks, 
after you have pumped up the clutch and your thighs look like Arnie's 
chest, the pedal will start to return.  I gave up after a while and just 
drove it.  A few days later, the pedal got better and now works normal.  
I have seen this on two or three of my cars.

It also helps to elevate the tail of the car as much as possible when 
bleeding.  This helps the bubbles rise to the back of the slave 
cylinder's bleed nipple.

Good luck,

Marv
