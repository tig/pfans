To Jeff Fortenberry and all those interested:

The original 944T camshaft is the same cam as used in the early 944 (pre
85/2) engines with a 12mm lift on the intake lobe and 11mm on the
exhaust lobe. The intake opened 1 degree after TDC and closed 49 degree
after BDC. The exh. opened 43 degrees before BDC and closed 3 degrees
before TDC.

Starting with the 85/2 in the non-turbo motor, the exhaust height was
changed to 12mm of lift.  The exh. opened 47 degrees before BDC and
closed 1 degree after TDC.  The intake remained the same.

The later cam can be used in the 944 turbo with no problems. 

The part # 944.105.155.05 R is the early cam for pre 85/2 cars and all
944 turbos.  PN#n 944.105.155.09 R is the number for 85/2 and later 944
cars up to 89. In 89, the # was changed to 944.105.155.10 but the specs
remained the same for the duration.
