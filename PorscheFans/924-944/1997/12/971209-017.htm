Jay,

You shouldn't have any problems with the 944 in snow.  I drove my 924
Turbo for several years, and my 944 for 10 years in the mountains of
Colorado and in Michigan during the winter.  The only thing I did was
put M + S tires on the cars.  They were great in the snow.  The weight
balance is the reason for the good traction and predictable manners, I
think.  Ground (snow) clearance during heavy snow storms made things
interesting at times, though!  The only time I got the car stuck was
when I was "practicing" skids and got off into deep, loose snow.  I
drove the car daily in ski country and wouldn't hesisate to do it again,
with the proper tires.

Have fun!
