Chris,
   When Porshce originally designed the 944, serious thought was given to
using a V-6 instead of the straight four. One of the considerations that
influenced the final decision was the space available in the engine
compartment (i.e. the 924 engine bay would not require significant
changes). The other consideration was that Porsche felt that by using the
twin balancer shafts (patented by Mitsubishi) they could produce a large
in-line four cylinder engine that would run as smoothly as a V-6. Although
the components of the 944 engine are well balanced from the factory, all
the internal balancing in the world doesn't help. All in-line four cylinder
engines have inherent second-order harmonic vibrations. Porsche used the
Mitsubishi designed balance shafts to counteract those second-order
vibrations. (Don't ask me to explain how it works!) As we have heard
before, running the balance shafts out of sync will create a noticable
vibration. Running with the balance shafts disconnected will increase the
vibration. To some it will be a noticable increase but, to others it will
not. On smaller in-line four cylinder engines the vibrations are not as
large. On the 944s, the combination of large displacement (for a 4
cylinder) and the large mass of the crankshaft (the 944 crank has huge
journals) can create some pretty large harmonic vibrations. I agree that
disconnecting the balance shafts on a 951 is a bad idea (unless there is
documentation to show the oil feed is unaffected by disconnecting the
balance shafts).

Happy Holidays
