Steve:

I have heard (second hand), of a supposedly "rebuilt" engine from Kempton,
not seeming to be so.  I learned of this after having a VERY bad experience
with him (thankfully on a much lower cost item).  

I've often wondered how he can afford to keep putting full page ads in Pano
and Excellence with the attitude he displayed to me and the bad stories
I've heard.

Maybe some people have had good experiences??  I sure wouldn't even think
of calling him for anything!

Have had very good experience with 944 Ecology and pretty good experience
with Oklahoma Foreign (had one part charged $10 more than quoted over
phone, but resolved satisfactorily).

hey Porschefans,

a few stray thoughts have been bugging me, i figured id run some of 
them by the experts and nail a few down. but 1st i wanted to pass 
on that i just received the new autoatlanta " mother of all porsche"
 catalog.  heavy on 914, but lots of interesting reading for all.
  
can one of the 924s, or 944 guys do me a favor and take a look at
your third brakelight in the hatch. i installed a factory piece in 
my 78', but im tired of looking at the dangling wires . i t would be 
great if someone could describe how those wires are routed, so
i could at least get an idea of how i should run them..
i heard a little "pop" when i turned on my turning indicator, now 
they wont cancel. it sounded like a spring poping off. does anyone 
know what the guts are in those little buggers, or will i have to 
replace the whole unit.
just after reading about everyones hatch problems, mine suddenly 
acts up, way up, at 60mph. i was lucky, no damage, and the locking 
pliers and screwdriver i always carry saved the day. i turned in the "pins"
3/4 of a turn each on the side of the road and it seems fine, so farrrr.

awhile back some wrote they were recovering their dash using leather
and gorrilla snot, did this work? i thinking of using the same technique
for the rear pillars between the hatch and the rear windows, insight would 
be appreciated.

thanks for any insight, 
eric (ericj001@aol.com)
78-924 "kills bugs fast" no way could that beetle keep up with me :)
