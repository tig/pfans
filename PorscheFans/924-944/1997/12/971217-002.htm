My mechanic told me that one way to check a water pump is to grab the
pulley on the front (the big one that drives the pump, not the other)
and try to move it side to side, and up and down.  If there is any play
in that bearing at all, you're on borrowed time.  Mine had play, not
it's new.  Too much money riding on that damn water pump no seizing so
it's OUTA there.  By the way, I have 100K on my 85.5 and this was it's
second water pump. If yours is original-----do you know how sorry you
could be if you don't replace it? ($$$$) I know I sleep better knowing
it's new.  Just food for thought.  Santa does deliver waterpumps you
know.
