In a message dated 97-12-18 00:30:45 EST, you write:

<<  was driving my 944 turbo down the street ... I go around the corner and
fell a die in the engine. but just for a second. I get to the stop  sign and
everything seems fine. I get down the road a bit and pull into a wendy's (I
was going to lunch) all the sudden the engine stalls I crank and crank and
crank. >>

I had a similiar problem that ended up in a new DME after about 6 or 8 months.
If you had someone w/ a spare DME that you could swap, it'ld be a quick check.
However, I didn't have the 1 cylinder smoking action going on.  It just would
start or run, or wouldn't start or run.  It would die while driving.  I don't
think I was getting spark during the episodes though.

Good luck,
Bob
