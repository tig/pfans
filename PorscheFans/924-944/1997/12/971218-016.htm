  Most of y'all know a lot more about I/C engines than I do but
are most in agreement that blow-by is a condition requiring a
rebuild or would only a valve job be indicated. Where is the oil
coming from? Is blow-by not exhaust gases escaping through the
intake ports on the exhaust stroke thus indicating bad valves?
Also how does oil get all the way through the intake manifold,
throttle body, and airflow meter against the flow of incoming
air? And would you find blow-by beneath the air filter or on the
upper surface of it?

  Please excuse all the (possibly) ignorant questions.
