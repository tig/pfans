Hello again everyone,
  I would like to thank everyone for their input into my problem. Funny 
thing is, is that I have experienced symptoms from several peoples 
descriptions. I did make a major discovery today. Car was off for about 1.5 
hrs. The temp. gauge was almost back to cold. I tried to start the car, and 
200 RPM was the best the car could muster up on it's own. Any gas from the 
petal, and it would die. I tried an experiment. I got out as the car was 
idling at 200 RPM, and pulled the fuel pump fuse. BINGO!!  The car started 
idling normal again!! I waited about 15 seconds, and replaced the fuse. It 
idled fine, and drove fine all the way home. 
  SO, I want to replace the fuel pressure regulator. But, before I do, I 
want to know if anyone has any other opinions about what caused today's 
episode. The part from PORSCHE is about $60, but I don't want to spend it 
without consulting "The PORSCHE Collective." 

   Todd Kent
