Your on the right track. I just repaired mine in my early 85 944. =
Tugging and fanagling with the gauge/fascia assembly will eventually =
yield a Eureka! The speedo cable is pretty stout and need to pull thru a =
rubber grommet in the firewall
 Which is why it's so damn determined to stay in. The whole assembly =
will only yield just enough to get a hand behind to disconnect the =
speedo cable. Once the cable is free, the whole thing can lay on the =
steering column to get access to gauge lamps. Have plenty on hand of =
both types(old bulbs get brittle and go bad just from the all the =
shaking that's required, kind of like my ex-wife). Socketed lamps for =
idiot light and plug-ins for gauge illumination. Once the speedo is out, =
you need to relieve the crimp on the outer bezel, I very carefully use =
an old jewelers screwdrive with a bend in it and make a small slit to =
get it started with an exacto knife. Once it opens up, you'll probably =
find a white plastic worm gear that has driven it's complimentary gear =
or shaft to the side where it just sits there happy as a clam to not be =
doing anything for a change. I slid the gear/shaft back over and =
installed a small brass space between the gear and shaft bushing to keep =
the whole thing from sliding around. I've had to do this on both my 79 =
924 and my 85 944. VDO needs a good slap in the head as far as I'm =
concerned.
