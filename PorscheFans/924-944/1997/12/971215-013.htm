I spoke w/ Powerhaus about a cheaper package (relatively speaking) for $8K.
 Involved nothing but prepping the engine, and if I recall correctly, it
involved using the S2 block w/ reduced compression, and a 951 head, intake,
turbo and exhaust.  I would have to install the turbo and exhaust myself. 
I apologize to Powerhaus if any of this is incorrect.
I've heard mixed reviews about using the 16-valve head with the turbo -- at
least one poster has commented that the engine management still needs
development.

I'd be happy with a modest 350 hp, and to baby the clutch and transmission.

Yeah, but then you'd have two slow S2s instead of one fast one. My concern
is whether you'd soon have one dead one, as opposed to two live ones.
Wonder if Powerhaus offers a warranty.

>But still, 18 grand is 18 grand!

But still, for a total cash output of around $25-30K, you'd have an
unusually fast car that handled incredibly well. I can't think of many
comparable cars for that price.
