Me again - depends on the year.

'86 23mm offset, 7+8x16" wheels, phione idals standard, fuchs $575 option.

Fuchs are pronounced "fook-s".  Fuchs are MUCH stronger as they are forged
boith weight the same.

'87-88 53mm offset.  Standard is phone dial Optional is "flat face"
forged.  again 7+8x16.  Fuchs cannot be made int his offset, necessitated
by moving the hubs out to make room for ABS on ALL 944 cars 87+.

'88S, '89 These cars are known as turboS.  They came with 7+9x16"
"Club Sport" forged wheels.  These are similar in appearance to "design 90"
wheels which came on the S2, but are forged. They can be spotted by an annodized *(not painted
silver finish) and a smooth face all the way to the rim-lip.

Incidentally, the fronts are the same forgings as the "flat dish" wheels with a "D" shaped
hole rather than a rectangular swept slot.

Beware that '86 944 turbos use "early offset" wheels - nearly the same as 911 -89
and '87+ 944 and variants use "late offset" wheels same as C2/993, 944S2, 968 and close to 
the 928 model line.  I prefer the later as you can get the newer design wheels for them
and they have stronger front spindles and bearings in common with the C2.

FYI,	
Steve

>>The 924/944 was never intended to be the 'entry level'  Porsche,
something the factory has tried to get away from, from day 1.  It was,
however, intended to be the cornerstone of Porsche production, and
ensure the companies survival as an independent manufacturer (a 'mass
market' Porsche, is there is such a thing)<<

Ok, so you don't like the term "entry level".  I admit  "Cornerstone of
Porsche production" does sound better. You Brits are too much.....LOL (no
offense meant) What does Porsche call the Boxster? introductory?

Call the 944 cars what you will, I think most of us are aware of Porsche's
intentional downrating of the 944 Turbo's power and performance numbers to
position it below the "Flagship" 928 and 911 Turbo models. 

>>On the subject of V6 engines, the factory actually ran a Renault derived
V6 engine 
in a pre-production prototype of the 944, (a 924 development and
previous to this the
original factory test bed, an Opel Kadett, if memory serves me correct.
This Opel was used to develop the transaxle for the 924/944),<<

Why did Porsche use a Renault engine, when the 924 Audi engine was already
available? Seems a hot rod 924 engine would more approximate the power
characteristics of the 944 2.5 ?  Are you sure this was done? What year are we
talking? Very strange.....

>>Contrary to popular belief, the 4 cyl. is not just half a 928 V8, though
it does share a few common components<<

The 944 engine is as close to half a 928 engine as it could be!  The bore
spacing, deck height, bore and stroke (for the years when displacement is
consistant with .5 of 928 displ. ) is identical. The engines use the exact
same bearings, rings, valves, valve springs, retainers, spring seats, keepers,
lifters, cam housings. 

Even the pistons would be the same, if not for the compression, and the rods
are only different because the are designed for use on a common bearing
journal, and only one side of the rod big end is clearanced for the crank
radius.  I call that the same engine with less cylinders.  BTW, Judging by the
number of manufacturers doing "Modular engines" today, Porsche was way ahead
of their time on this.

Not wanting to seed a long thread here...just adding relevant addendum.

Regards,


Steve R.
