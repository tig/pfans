Joe,
    I`m assuming you have an 84, 944, non turbo. If this is what your
dealing with, then I think you may have used the wrong measuring points
on the air flow meter. The Haynes manual states: 150 to 250 mV  between
TERMINAL 7 and ground. Not 250 to 260mV between TERMINAL 2 and ground,
this is for the turbo.
          If the coolant and air temp. sensors are OK, then the O2
sensor is usually the cause of a rich running condition. Have you
checked it? There are two possible types of sensor; 1 wire or 3 wire.
The additional 2 wires on the three wire sensor provide power and ground
for a heater element inside the sensor. An O2 sensor only produces a
signal when it is over 500 degrees F, so the 3 wire sensor simply gets
up to temperature more rapidly. Either way you need to measure the
output voltage of the sensor to determine if its telling the computer to
control fuel delivery. Check the sensor operation by sticking a straight
pin through the O2 sensor SIGNAL wire. Connect your digital voltmeter
between ground and this pin. With the fully warmed up engine running ,
you can now see what the computer sees. Any reading below 0.5V is
considered lean by the computer (so it richens the fuel delivery). Any
reading over 0.5V is considered rich (so the computer leans out fuel
delivery). At hot idle you should see the O2 sensor voltage fluctuate
back and forth across 0.5 volts as it continuously checks and corrects
itself. If you like, you can put your voltmeter on your windshield and
watch your mixture voltage as you drive around.  A  DEAD  O2 sensor will
typically put out a continuous low reading, this will cause the computer
to continually richen fuel delivery. Note: A vacum leak, weak injector
or ignition miss can cause a lean (less than 0.5V) reading at the O2
sensor as well. The O2 sensor should be replaced approximately every
60,000 mi. If you can solder, go to any auto parts store and ask for the
cheapest 1 or 3 wire sensor (depending upon which one your car has) and
solder your old sensor`s  wiring harness on to the new one. The factory
sensors cost four times more and are the same except for the
connector.       Good Luck,   Dave.

Very carefully.

Hi P-Fans
I want to remove the airbags from my '89 S2, at least on the driver's side, so
I can use my favorite Momo wheel (it's been on my last five cars), but also on
the passenger side.  I seem to recall a posting on this several months ago,
but can't find it.  Can anyone advise me on the way you do this?  TIA.
