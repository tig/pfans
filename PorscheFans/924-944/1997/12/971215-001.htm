Kevin,

Having done a few of these now I can offer two thoughts.  First is use a 
hefty breaker bar and a 5 foot pipe from the top.  The problem with this 
approach is that the fan housings are very close and could get hit by the 
pipe when it cuts loose.  If you have a lift you can attack it better 
from the bottom.  I use the breaker bar to get it started, but have a 
Craftsman 1/2" ratchet that I use to finish the job with my 5 foot pipe.  
My reasoning is that the initial effort requires more torque, so I use a 
good breaker bar, but the bolt still needs to be cranked further before 
it will get loose enough to use a standard ratchet without the pipe.  The 
ratchet allows you to easily regroup and pull again as each pull only 
allows for about a 10 - 15 degree swipe.

The second method can be done from the bottom.  I have used a short 2 - 3 
foot pipe on an old ratchet (Craftsman are great if you snap it, get 
another free) and use my floor jack to push it.  This saves some personal 
effort on your behalf.

Remember, the bolt is a standard fastener and requires anticlockwise 
rotation to remove it.  Use a good flywheel lock (available for $20 from 
your dealer) and crank away.
