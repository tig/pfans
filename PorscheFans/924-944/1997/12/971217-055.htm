Here is where the list become invaluable. 

I was driving my 944 turbo down the street ... I go around the corner and fell a die in the engine. but just for a second. I get to the stop  sign and everything seems fine. I get down the road a bit and pull into a wendy's (I was going to lunch) all the sudden the engine stalls I crank and crank and crank. The car will not fire up. I come back after work and try again. with the pedal matted to the floor it stays running like a car running on 1 cylinder. gray /whitish smoke comes from the back of the car. I let off of the accelerator a bit and it cuts off. After a tow home I checked a few things. Fuel pump seems to be pumping .....spark plugs firing but still no running. tested the fuel pump by losening the preasure relife valve and turning the car over ... shot gas out in a stream. checked the coil with an old spark plug on one of the wires.. it sparked.....So here i am with no car ... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated...

TIA
