You're right, the "pop" was the cancel spring dropping out. Replace the
whole switch, either used from 944 ecology (georgeb@mhv.net) or new from
Imparts (1-800-555-1212).

<< I just came from Porsche's web site. The new 911's are aweful looking!
(IMHO). They look like
 a rehashed Pontiac Sunfire. It's water cooled too! *Gasp*. Sorry to waste
band width, but I'm sitting here shaking my head, wondering what Porsche's
designers were thinking...

Steve, 
The numbers say it all.

<< I have an 86 944 NA, my first Porsche and I love it. I have 160,000 miles
on
 the original motor and it still runs great. The exterior & interior are near
 perfect so I am going to keep it for a few more years. Would like to get
 more performance out of the car without putting a Chevy motor in it. I have
 considered supercharging the motor but would like information from anyone
 that has done this first hand. I would have far more into the car than I
 could get out of it, but far less into than a pristine 951 or 968. Any
 thoughts would be appreciated >>

MR,
Just remember, if you drastically increase the power by lets say
supercharging, you're going to be adding a LOT of additional stress on that
motor that is 160k miles old.  Then when your bearings go out, you'll
DEFINATELY have more in it than a 951!!!
