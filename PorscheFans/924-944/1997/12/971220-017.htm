P.C.,
    I've seen the insides of a lot of 951s including the one presently in
my '86 and the '86 that is the platform for my 2.8L conversion. I've never
seen a 951 block with steel sleeves from the factory. I've yet to see the
insides of an '89 951 so, I don't know if they started sleeving the later
models. I don't believe the '87s or the '88s I've seen did. If anyone has
heard of a 951 that came from the factory with steel sleeves, please let me
know. 
   Personally, if were considering major power modifications to an early
944, I would seriouly consider supercharging over going the turbo route. As
a matter of fact, I'm considering the purchase of a 944 for just such a
project. However, I didn't realize that the compression ratio for the
German spec cars was that high. I'm not familiar enough yet with the
supercharger kits to know if that rules out supercharging. 
    The 2.8L conversion is not worth the expense for a NA car. The amount
of horsepower/performance gain by doing the 2.8L on a normally aspirated
car does not justify the expense. How is it justified on a turbo? The
difference on the turbos is a  result of the increase in exhaust flow which
produces a much larger and more responsive turbocharger (i.e. with the same
turbocharger, you not only get a higher output but, it spools up quicker as
well). 
    Unless you have some emotional attachment to the '83, I'd recommend
selling it and buying a 951. The '86s are getting very reasonable and by
the time you got through converting the '83 to a turbo you could probably
keep the '83 and buy and '86 951 as well. If you can afford it, buy a Turbo
S or an '89 Turbo. Personally, I'd like to have a NA 944 to go with my 951.
There are a lot of discussions about which is better -- the NAs or the
Turbos. I've spent time in both cars and the two are as much different as
they are alike. I don't think it does justice to either car to try and
compare them because they are both great cars. I know this hasn't been much
help but, whatever you decide to do, both cars are still Porsches (contrary
to what those
air-cooled believe) and there is no substitute. By the way, what does the
back end of a 911 look like?
