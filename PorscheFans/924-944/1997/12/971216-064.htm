Yes!  Go into the configuration of your e-mail software and tell it to 
post in plain text instead of HTML.  Since I use a text only reader, I 
usually delete HTML infected mail posted to the list.. but yours looked 
interesting enough for me to read.

<< Next, the facts on the Chevy are, the V-8 weighs in at 505 pounds,
 versus the 310 for a 924, 360 for a 924Turbo/944NA and 410 for the 951
 engines. This can be compensated by upping the fron springs to 2 >>

Jim,
I'm amazed that the weight differential is so little!  Although the
transmission is in line first, my ultimate goal (is there ever an ultimate
goal, or are they all just the next step??) is to have my engine stroked.  2.8
seems the obvious size for power/longevity balance.  I had though about the
350, but never was able to find any info on it.  Plus, it just seemed that the
weight change would suck.  Why bother when you can develope 350 HP w/ the
4-banger?  HOWEVER, once you include $5k for the stroker kit, a couple $k for
this and that, $3-$5k for labor, you're really getting up there!  HOWEVER
again...to do the LT1, you first need an LT1 (I've heard you can get one out
of a rolled vehical w/ electronics for $2k or so.  Now comes
installation...gasp....  This has got to be where it gets scary!!!!  Can you
mate the 350 to the 951 drivetrain?   

I'll quit now or I'll be babbling like a lunatic all night!!!

<< But, if you really want a Porsche with a V-8, either buy a 928 or wait 2
 years or so.  >>

Or try to get the 8 cylinder 914 birthday car ; )
