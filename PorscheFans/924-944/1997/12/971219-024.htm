Jeez, Joe, lighten up, it is not the end of the world.   You will not die
from this, but perhaps be poorer for a short while . . .

You need to get to it because the front main seal is right next to the 
lower timing belt sprocket, and oil on the timing belt is not good and
will lead to premature death of said item, and I expect you know 
what that means.

Without the belt tensioning tool this is NOT a DIY job, unfortunately.

If you only have the occasional drop, and removal of the upper belt 
cover reveals a dry belt, then you have lots of time to deal with the
problem.   There are several possible sources for the oil, however,
and you really need to figure out what's going on.   The both the
camshaft seals and balance shaft seals could be the culprits as well.

SO, figure on buying as much as eight hours of shop time for all of 
this, including replacement of ALL the seals.   Consider the economy
of doing the belt and water pump along the way.   These are cheap
DIY operations, but if you have to buy the shop time, you have different
options.   

All of this is done with the motor in and is standard fare for any shop
experienced in 944 work.   Switching to dino oil may indeed slow down
the leak, as M1 seems to have the ability to find its way through most
anything.

Good luck.

Dave
