Hi, folks,

Well, Netscape Navigator has screwed me again.  It deleted all of the
e-mail addresses from the address file.  Of course, I should have had a
current back-up of the file, so it's my own fault.  I had been saving
all of the addresses for '88 Turbo S and '89 and later Turbo owners.  If
it's not too much trouble, would list members who own one of these cars
send me a reply to this post, please?  No need for a long reply, but
model year would be helpful.  Also, please reply directly to me, so as
not to waste listserver bandwidth.  Thanks.

Mike Fields
