Hi list,
With the winter holliday season starting up already in Holland, malls =
decorated
in St. Nicolas-style and immediately thereafter for christmas here's some
sing-alongs for whenever you're in the mood. =
Sorry for the lengthy posting, but like they say: it comes but once a year.=
...


(The new 911. Melody: Santa Claus is coming to town...)

You better watch out
'cause if you succeed
you're liable to break every limit on speed
nine-eleven's coming to town

it's got a new front
a redesigned rear
its boot will now hold
more than a six-pack of beer
nine-eleven's coming to town

its engine's watercooled now
so no more air that's cooked
experience its awesome torque
and you'll be forever hooked

so if you decide
to go take a ride
you'd better prepare		=
to set some money aside
nine-eleven's coming to town


(Our beloved model, the 944. Melody: Santa Claus is coming to town...)

You better watch out				=
I know this one sucks	=
or else be prepared to lose major bucks
check your balance- and cam belt today.

Although they look fine
and purr like a cat
the belts can sure fail
and crash your engine like that!
check your balance- and cam belt today.

Belts really don't break easy	=
but clearly once they do
the valves and head will not survive
and your cash will follow too.

So take this advice
just trying to be nice
have them checked-out
or you'll soon pay the price	=
check your balance- and cam belt today.


(This one applies to all Porsches. Melody: Let it snow.)

Oh the pavement outside is frightful
but my Porsche drives so delightful
just gave it that showroom glow
made it so, made it so, made it so

the salt and snow can't hurt me
thanks to that galvanised body
let the winter gails come and blow
to and fro', to and fro', to and fro'

when I finally shut it down
after having it parked in the shop
I think of all the Pfans in town
whose jaws this car's gonna drop

its outside clean and shiny
its engine bay neat and tidy
the interior a pride to show
made it so, made it so, made it so
.
