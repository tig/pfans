Randall,

Try disconnecting the temp.sensor at the radiator. It's at the left, top.
Maybe hard to reach from above since you have a turbo.
If the sensor is fault, the fan wil stop. Shortcut the two wires and the fan
starts again.

Easy to replace. Do not overtighten the new one. That may destroy your
radiator.

Regards, Rudy Koskamp.

In a message dated 97-12-22 04:27:02 EST, you write:

<< I have a problem with my turbo. I own a 86'951. Turbo has just been
 rebuild, all connections and hoses
 are new. There is no leak. Max. boost is 1.2 (absolut) or 0.2. 
 Could the DME be wrong ? Could this be a sensor fault ? What sensors
 could be affected ? Where are those fu**ing sensors located ?.
  (Repair have cost me about 3500 $ (including some other stuff)) >>

Check if the cycling valve is plugged in. 
0.2 Bar is the minimum max boost that the DME can dial in.  This is
accomplished by supplying the full pressure signal from the intake to the
waste gate diaphram via the cycling valve.  If the valve is unplugged, it will
send the full pressure to the diaphram, and you should get .2bar

PS:  What all was included in the $3500?
