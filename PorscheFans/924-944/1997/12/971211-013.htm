In a message dated 97-12-11 10:35:00 EST, you write:

<< I checked my notes from Autothority regarding the rotary switch on a 85.5
 944, and it seems you can only retard ignition timing by 2 degrees.  Know
 if other models allow you to advance timing? I couldn't find any info in
 the Porsche service manuals (which didn't surprise me). >>

Doug,

The 951 has a rotary switch on the DME which lets you slightly adjust your
fuel mixture and the spark advance.  The exact settings are in the faq, but i
basically lets you adjust your fuel to :  3% and 6% rich and allows the spark
advance to be adjusted to stock and 3 degrees advance of stock, and 3 degrees
retarded from stock.  Sounds retarded, huh?

Nick you ask:

>>Lessee -- the stock 2.7 was 165 hp (?) at the flywheel and you're talking
about 210 hp at the same.  Which is the same as the stock S2.  Not bad! 
Porsche didn't do that well on relative hp on early US and Euro spec cars,
which had about a 1.5 point difference.  If I recall correctly, stock
compression on the 2.7 liter was 10.9:1.  How much higher did you bump it,
and how did you do it? Decking a couple of mm would get it around 13 (?),
and the valves must have gotten fairly close to the pistons. <<

The stock compression is about 1/2 point shy of spec. That explains how these
cars could have basically the same Motronic system as the earlier 2.5 8 valve
engines with no knock sensors.  To up the compression, I had .006 taken off
the deck and the head was shaved .020.  The retarded timing was corrected with
a adjustable cam sprocket. I calculated 11:.2 compression.  Almost a full
point from where I started on this motor.  I feel the small, stock airflow
sensor is the major impediment to making power on this engine. 
 
>> What octane
did you have to use? And the airflow sensor --  replaced with a hot-wire
sensor? Sounds interesting.  Can't recall if that model had knock sensors.
How long did the engine last?<<

This is a dedicated track car that runs race gas. The MoTec engine management
system does not use an airflow sensor. The throttle body goes straight to the
air cleaner. It is a speed density engine management system that allows the
fuel/ignition to be mapped via laptop computer.

>>How long did the engine last?<<

3 years and still going strong.  This car has proven very reliable, with the
exception of a mis-shift (3rd instead of 5th), which bent all the valves, no
engine failures.  The car runs competitively with non-chipped 944 turbo's and
911 SC's.  In fact, friday a group of us are testing this car and some other
944/951 racecars at our local racetrack, Willow Springs Raceway.  Kind of a
pre-holiday speed fix. 

One last thing....a side note to Jim Pasha's post about the 20 valve Audi
Turbo's:

I remember seeing the Audi Turbo Quattros kick ass in the SCCA Trans Am series
in the mid 80's. The SCCA eventually restricted the turbo inlet on these cars
to allow some parity between the STOCK FRAMED 4 door Audi sedans and the tube
chassis Roush Mustangs and DeAtley Camaros (can you say series sponser?).  My
point? the often maligned 944-Audi connection is nothing to be ashamed of.....

Regards,



Steve Russakov
P.S.  The 10% power loss I refered to in my previous post was in reference to
converting the mentioned rear wheel hp to engine hp.
