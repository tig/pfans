It shouldn't bother you at all.  I went through the same thing early this
year.  I wanted to get a C2, until I drove one :)  Every company has a
target market, the company you mention obviously is not targeting the
water pumpers.

If a company is stupid enough to run their business based on emotion, because
the owner doesn't like the 924/944/928 line, then they won't be in business
for long!  I doubt that's the case with Carlsen.  On this list right now,
there are over 1400 members, that's over 1400 potential customers for any
company that shows an interest in these cars, if Carlsen doesn't want
that potential business, show them your opinion of them with your wallet,
go buy from someone else.

And, anyways, who needs Carlsen or any other arrogant company!  We have Jason
Burkett, George B. and a few others who are 10X more knowledgeable about
water pumpers and p-cars in general than the $10/hr monkeys that work the
phones at most of these shops.  I really shouldn't call them monkeys,
afterall, they are only giving out the info they've been taught, and they're
probably working their butts off to one day own a p-car themselves.

Out here in B.C., I've found the p-car population to be some of the most
arrogant, even some of the water pumpers are arrogant!  But, like anytime
you get a large group together, there will be jerks, but there are quite
a few nice people too, they just don't stick out like the jerks do.

I think you already go to the track, so you'll know what I mean by this,
at the track, there is great respect for the water pumpers.  At our last
track day, almost every session, the only cars still running were the 944's,
all the other Camaros, Hondas, RX-7,s etc, etc, were having brake problems,
or broken parts, etc, etc.  911's at our local track are SLOW because of the
configuration and the general lack of driving practice most of these guys
do.

Anyhow, any time you get oil cooler envy, go look at the 911 dash, and laugh
out loud at the 4 cigarette lighters in the middle console!!!

Farzaan.
89 951 - one day I'll own a C2 Turbo, but I won't trade my 951 to get it!
