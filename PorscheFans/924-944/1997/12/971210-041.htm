My mail from the other day (see below) is a hint on how to get extra power
out of an S2.  I am in between seasons here in Australia and am planning an
'upgrade' programme to improve the power for my S2 which is my daily driver
and used for track events.  Our new power to weight classes are about to be
decided for the Porsche Club of New South Wales (Australia) 1998 (and on)
seasons.  So depending on what gain I am allowed to get without putting the
car up against car/driver combinations that I would have a real hard time
matching, I plan  on developing the car to between 220 (currently 211) and
240 horses.

If we go back to basic principles, an internal combustion engine is
basically an air pump.  We have to change the fundamental characteristics of
that pump if we are going to see any significant gains in torque or HP.  If
you think about what the function of a turbo charger is you can see it's
working on the characteristics of the 'air pump'.  Now I do agree that
'chips' will help with throttle response and a few horses (even chips on a
turbo are playing with boost pressure) as most cars are mapped for a
compromise between power, economy etc etc, however if we change some of the
main characteristics like intake manifolds and exhaust manifolds, cam
profiles, and so forth THEN have a chip mapped for our new air pump I think
you will see some quite reasonable gains.  Remember a 968 CS and a 944 S2
have exactly the same capacity, block and number of valves, etc but the S2
is 211 Hp and the 968 is 240. So where's the horses?  We can start with the
'Varioram' (playing with the inlet manifolds), then the valves, cams etc so
again we are just making a better air pump out of the engine.  

I know the list has said this before but I am going to say it again (in an
'Aussie' accent).  The best bang for buck performance gain is driver
training and track time.  We had our last track event a couple of weeks ago
at one of the major circuits here in Sydney and there were 3 x 968 Club
Sports in the class above me.  One was absolutely standard except for some
good break pads and some Falken road race tyres and the other two were at
various stages of development (one is an ex production class race car and
was shared by two brothers). My S2 has 17inch rims, Pirelli P Zero tyres,
coil overs and a couple of race seats.  The engine is absolutely standard
(standard chip as well). The results?  The guy driving the standard 968 did
a best time of 1.51.28 one of the brothers driving the ex race car did
1.55.24 the other brother in the same car did 1.57.32 and the 3rd 968 did
2.03.14  My 'under powered' S2 did a best time of 1.56.39.  My point?  The
guy with the standard car is a very good steerer and basically blew the
modified 968s away.  My S2 split the brothers driving THE SAME CAR (don't
forget they have 30 horses on me at about the same weight) and the remaining
968 was well out of the picture (this time). Now I have been driving this
car in this configuration for over a year now at events and now I am ready
(as a driver) to start looking at fine tuning suspension and increasing
power.

So to really improve your S2, spend money modifying the 'nut' behind the
wheel and drive that thing harder.  I will share with the S2 owners on this
list how my upgrade programme goes (in real HP) when it is done. I have to
be careful though because some of my class competitors are on this list and
I don't want to scare the 968 drivers either <grin> so if your interested
let me know and we can share some dialogue.

Anyway that is my $0.02 worth (with the current value of the AUS dollar
that's probably about $0.0126 US)

Rgds from down under (and seasons greetings)

P.S.  If you want to make your S2 go really quickly, put in a 968 CS gear
box.

crawled under the car and peeked up into the bell housing and just
happened to see that little reference stud with the allen head. Lets
supose we had a drill and tap handy and we moved that stud, oh say.....
5 degrees in the advance direction. Of course if we did this, we`d be
sure to wear safety goggles when drilling so the "chips" don`t fall in
our eyes (pardon the pun). And we would also want to make sure that the
assembled height of the stud in its new location is the same as before.
Wouldn`t this have the effect of advancing the entire timing map 5
degrees? I think so! Naturally we would have to run the good gas, but it
is a small price to pay for 15 "free" horsepower.>>

Dave:  you've got my interest up now, buddy!  How do you measure 5 degrees on
the housing? (I'm math impaired.)  Also, doesn't the ECU have to be remapped
as well to coordinate with the timing advance?  More tricks, please!!!

Dear Joe & P-Fans
	You will have to turn the steering wheel from lock to lock a few times. It
might take a day or so for all the air to bleed out of the rack. With the
engine running,cycle the rack full lock to lock, remove the PS reservoir cap
and check for any foam or bubbles. If there are bubbles, keep turning! You did
use AFT fluid right? You could also try bleeding the PS lines at the steering
rack w/engine running, messy - and they are very hard to reach! 

					Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com
