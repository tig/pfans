Hello Marshall,

Yup, me.

I try to suck out as much old brake fluid in the master cylinder reservoir
as possible. I use a turkey baster. Then fill with fresh fluid, and 
bleed each brake clinder and the clutch slave cylinder.

If you like to do things yourself, then this is a job for you. 

Some advice:
You sound like you have a Mityvac type hand operated vacuum pump.
That will work OK for bleeding the fluid. Make sure to use the
proper sized adapter on each bleed nipple. It makes a difference.
You might see some bubbles in the fluid that comes out. Don't worry
about them, they are most likely caused by air getting into the
bleed nipple.

Use a box end wrench on the bleed nipples. They are less likely to
round or break the bleed nipple. 

Before you start, put the car on 4 jackstands and remove all the wheels.

Proper bleed order is passenger rear, driver rear, passenger front,
driver front. Then clutch slave. After each wheel, check the level of
fluid in the reservoir.

You should definately do the clutch slave. Put the front wheels back
on, and lower the front of the car. Leave the rear up in the air.
Make sure the front part of the reservoir has plenty of fluid in it.
Only the front compartment of the reservoir leads to the clutch 
master. If you are not careful, you can suck air inro the clutch
lines, and you'll be very sorry.

Remove the positive battery connection! You probably will have to
remove the starter to get at the clutch slave cyl bleed nipple.
Even if you don't, you do not want power at the starter solenoid!

Have fun!
