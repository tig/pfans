Brian,
Price sounds about right to me. The seller is just being a bit more 
realistic with his asking price than some of the clowns out there.

Regarding the water pump, I suggest you change it prophylactically 
when you change the timing & balance belts, which should be as soon 
as you get the car, unless you know they've been done. Of course  If 
it's leaking, change it right away.
