Hmmm, my son has spent a grand total of $140 on his '89 turbo since last
August.  This includes $70 to re-check the cam belt tension (the PO had =
it
replaced with the head gasket job), and $70 to chase down a very small
pin-hole leak in a small water hose.  That's it for maintenance except =
for
an oil change.  He did buy a CD head unit, but that wasn't a necessity.

I thought all this stuff was covered by your warranty, so why the C$4200
expense?

What is the proper procedure?  We're getting a bit tired of all the brake
dust from the stock pads.

Hey, are you kidding.  This is early March... count on lots of rain down
here.  It was pouring today.
