I don't remember the URL, but the Jaguar net group has put together a 120+
page manual on repairing the XJS model.  They call it "Experience in a
Book".  It's available for downloading from their website.  Seems we could
start the same kind of project for the 924/944 series.  After all, we've
got the Clutch FAQ, the CV FAQ, a nice writeup on the rear speakers, and
an upcoming (I hope) writeup on the sunroof.  Looks like a great start to
me.  I'm trying to collect these items for myself and wouldn't mind having
them avail. for the group.  Here's some of the issues that come to mind... 

1.  I don't have a web site of my own.  I would have to have our sysadm.
post the file for me and do so at every update.  At first, this would be
frequently.

2.  I don't want to be held responsible for the correctness of the  
content.  Whenever I get several suggestions on the same topic, I would be
inclined to include them all, but some editorial privalege would have to
be taken.

3.  I am not a Porsche expert, but I'm getting better all the time.  My
experience is mostly with Lotuses (I have three).  I'm an electrical
engineer by trade.

4.  I couldn't be held to a timetable.  I have little free time, but would
enjoy giving this a try.  Your help, especially in formatting things
nicely, would be critical.  If they are written well, it would be little
more than adding them in.

5.  The info. would come from the group.  No plagerizing of manuals is
contemplated.

6.  I would probably keep my personal version in MSWord format.
Downloaders should have a choice of ASCII or MSWord format.

7.  It would be nice to have the different FAQ's available for download
from the PorscheFan's website.  Maybe that would be better than a "book".

8.  The "book" would be considered a supplement to the commercial manuals
available (Porsche, Haynes, etc.), and would be more personal and
detailed.  I find the comments about prices and sources to be very useful.

How about some feedback on this?
