With regard to David's earlier posting about the clutch mast cyl. and 
replacement... I had to do this last year myself.  I bled the system and 
it still didn't feel much better than the old one (I was just minus a 
nasty leak onto my floor mats), then this winter the clutch and trans. 
really tightn' up.  On really cold mornings here in Iowa it was pretty 
hard to shift; but now that the weather is warming up/and after some 
highway driving it shifts just like it used to and the clutch ped. feels 
like it did before.

It's not spongy or anything it just should feel or "push" back more.  I'm 
going to try to rebleed the system(maybe take it to someone) here in 
about another week or so.. does anybody have any thoughts on this that 
might save time and $$$?

thanks,
	(and David mine took me all day too.  I even left my seat in the 
car and just loosened some booster parts/ the only thing that came out 
was the mast. cyl. and it was still a pain!)
