  Hello P-Fans,
(my apology, if this has been sent to this group before)
  
  I have been here on the list since November. By now, I found out, that
all of you are cool men, understanding what Porsche, driving and traveling  
means. 
  I come to you with a few of, for me very important, questions. I have
just bought a flight ticket to New York (on British Airways for $480). 
I'm going to spend the whole August traveling from NYC to Denver,
where I'm going to meet my girlfriend and then we want to see some Natl.
Parks like Zion, Kings Canyon, Yosemite etc. We are 23 years old
university students.

  Would you recommend any place to see, which could be interesting for
a 23 years old couple ? (Anywhere - from Seattle and San Francisco to
Miami and Boston.) We are interested in nature, but also hidden pearls of
big cities, which you can never see with any travel agency.

  Would you let us spend a night by you and save this way time and money
for a hotel, hostel, camp ? (The currency exchange-rate is our problem)
Because I am used to wild traveling around the whole Europe, I'll have my
own tent, so we will thank even for a place in a garden.

 Now, to the main problem of ours.
 I would very appreciate any help with finding an older (temporarily
unused) car, which the owner would lend us for about 2-3 weeks, we would
take any car, which survives realtively long, but very careful driving. 
(I have driven an 68 Falcon From Wash. D.C. to San Francisco and back 2
years ago.) 
 I belive, this is the best group of people to ask.

 I am looking forward to all of your replies, comments, threads :) and 
hope to meet you this summer. 
 
Good luck to you and to your Porsches and do not forget, that anytime you
come to Prague, you have always where to stop and get help with anything.
