I must be the one in a million (horseshoes up the bum or something like
that) because I lent my 944 to my brother while my wife and I spent a
month touring Europe. When I got back my brother informed me that the
car wouldn't start. After much cranking, battery boosting etc, I had the
car towed to the shop where I was informed that the timing belt had
broken. I brought the car home and proceeded to tear it down. Once I
took the valve assembly off I noticed that all of the valves were seated
properly. I had expected that at least one valve would be bent and
therefore would hang up. Then I tapped each valve with a rubber hammer
and each valve sprang back smartly sugessting that none of them were
bent. After check the compression each cylinder came back within 5 lbs.
of each other (150, 155, 155, 150). So I put it all back together with
new belts (tensioned the belts by "feel") and drove very carefully to
the shop to have them tensioned. The shop guys shook their heads and
said they'ld never seen it happen before but it is possible. My brother
has the car now (this happened 3 years ago) and its running fine.
