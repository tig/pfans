Hey dudes,

Finally, I found a Dynojet to get the car on, the only problem is, I had
to convince the shop to buy one for me to use :)  Minnam Racing, a company
that I used to deal with when I had the Talon is having one installed in
3 weeks time.  They will likely charge C$100 (about US$70) for 1 hour
of dyno time.  I've booked 5 hours on the dyno to get our cars on there.
To make the most effective use of the dyno, we should come up with all
the different things we want to try.  If you have any things you are
curious on, let me know and I'll try and fit it in the timeline.  I'm
going to test the following, so far:

Autothority 2.2 Stage II chips
Autothority 2.7 Stage II chips
Andial Turbo Cup computers
K&N air filter

I'm looking for a set of stock chips to test, if anyone has them and a 
stock boost bolt too would be nice to get a good baseline figure.

Next thing, we tried to align my car last night from 6:00pm to almost
midnight!  We couldn't get the alignment machine to repeat the figures.
We'd set it all up nice, take it out for a boot, get the alignment heads
on the wheels again and the numbers would be way out there.  My hunch
is that the machine was not operating correctly.  Tommorow, I'm
trying a more sophisticated machine and hopefully we'll get it right
this time.

Farzaan.
89 951.
