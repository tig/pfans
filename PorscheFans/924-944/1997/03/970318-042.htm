Porschefans:

We have had some fun recently discussing the relative merits and performance
of 951s vs. 968s.  How about a different question:  When I see a late model
911 on the road, say, 89-92 non-turbo C2 or C4, is that car faster or quicker
than my 92 968 or a late 951?  Given the handling advantages of our
water-pumpers, which is faster on a winding road?

I suspect the best way to answer this question would be to look at a PCA club
racing class that has stock or near-stock 911 and 951/968 models competing
against each other.  Is there such a class?  Who usually comes out on top?
 The reason I ask this is that I realize that most people consider 911 series
models to be the "real Porsches," but I suspect that my 968 is the match of
any non-turbo model up through 1992.  Am I wrong?

Finally, how does the 944S2 model stack up?  I think it had a 3.0 liter motor
like my 968 (right, Wes Shew?).  Is it the same motor, and is the performance
similar to the 968?

Questions, questions.  Hope I didn't bore you all with my idle speculation.
