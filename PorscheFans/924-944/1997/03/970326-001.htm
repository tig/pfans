     Anthony,
     
     That might be me.  Could you send me your E-mail address (I am not 
     getting the list sent to me and I have been using the Archives to 
     retrieve the list).  I would be glad to forward those posts.
     
     Also, there was another post from another member that talked about 
     adjustment of the sunroof clutch on the motor.
     
     Anyway, I would be glad to send you what I have learned.  I also (when 
     time permits) plan to consolidate those two posts into a FAQ that 
     everyone can use to repair their sunroof.  This seems to be a popular 
     subject and I would expect as the weather warms up, so will the desire 
     for working sunroofs.

     A while back someone posted a lengthy post on sunroof repair. I now 
     have a
     friend who is doing that repair himself.
     
     Could the people responsible for it please repost, it would be of 
     great
     help.
     
     Thanks
     
     Anthony
