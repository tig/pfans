Hello gentlemen,

This saturday morning while bopping along my favorite winding road (and
going the speed limit by the way), a pedestrian decided to run out onto
the road ( I was driving past a college and it was about 1:30 am, about
the time the bars around here close...)  Since I am intrinsically a nice
guy, I decided not to run him down.  Instead I sacrificed my 944S to the
great god of 7" tall granite curbs.  All 4 tires blew (Sp Sport 8000),
all 4 wheels are bent beyond recognition (Design 90/C2 wheels), both
airbags came out, windsheild cracked, airdam cracked, fog lights hosed,
and the sunroof popped out (!).  There is also a small dent in the left
front 1/4 panel.  The light in my glove box popped out of its mounting.
But at least my CD player didn't skip.  

This is what I can see.  What do you think may also be wrong with it?  I
need ammo when the Adjuster comes to see it.  

I am thinking that these things could also be screwed up:

A arms 
tie rods
steering rack
struts and strut towers

what could I have bent up in the rear suspension?

Any anecdotes about similar situations and how they were fixed (or
totaled) would be appreciated...

Cross your fingers and hope its totaled.
