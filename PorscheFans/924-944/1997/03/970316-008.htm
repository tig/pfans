The solenoids (two of 'em) are located under the passenger's side dash.
Remove the glovebox (6 screws or so) and you'll see them both.  The
hot-water shutoff valve in the engine bay is controlled by the lower
solenoid.  The upper one controls all the vent flaps (I'm not sure about
that-- check it out to be sure).  Anyhow, sounds to me like both the
solenoids are bad-- the lower one is bad on mine and that's why I get full
heat.
