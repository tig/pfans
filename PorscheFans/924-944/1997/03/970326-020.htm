I think you need to calm down a little. No one on this list is going to
disparage a 944. Quite the opposite, people are on this list because they
love 944's. Why else would they be here?

I don't think George or Mike wrote anything like that. From David Rife's
post, he is clearly a neophye (no offense, we were all neophytes once)
and has a lot to learn. Sometimes, the best way to learn is to sit
quietly, and read and listen and watch.

The plain simple truth is that if you are looking for high performance
acceleration from a 944, it makes much more financial sense to get a
944 turbo. It costs a lot of money to get any significant horsepower
increases from a NA 944. As has been written here many, many times,
most of the bolt on parts to not deliver as advertised. Chips for NA
cars add VERY little. Changing the Fuel Pressure regulator also does about
nothing for stock motors. Same thing with high output spark boxes. I
believe you can see some improvement with modifying the path through
the engine, ie extrude hone, throttle body, header and exhaust.
However, those changes will cost a good amount of money, and now you
have a car that is basically a bastard. The suspension and brakes can
no longer handle the power of the motor, so they get upgraded. Pretty
soon, you have a sinkhole where your wallet used to be.

Look, there are jerks, morons, and idiots wherever you go. Unfortunately,
you ran into one. What can you do about it? Bite your lip, and move on.

I've seen well prepared, well driven Porsches beaten pretty soundly by
a rattletrap Minicooper.

The best advice given to Mr. Rife was to join the PCA, and learn to drive.
Most people cannot use anywhere near the capability of the car. After 
learning how to drive, and knowing the capabilities of the car, and of
other Porsches, he can make an informed descision as to what, if any
modifications should be made.

Personally, I bought my first Porsche, an 86 944, in Feb. of 94. I
started autocrossing and participating in the driver education
program.  After doing that for a year, I wanted a car with more
performance.  I loved the way the car handled, looked, and rode, but I
wanted something with more acceleration. I got tired of hounding the
911's in the corners, only to be left behind on the straights.  After
evaluating my options (money), I drove a few 911's, and a few 944
turbo's. To me, there was no comparison. I bought an 89 944 turbo.

Good luck,
