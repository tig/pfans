Hi all,

I've posted this before, however the collective knowledge of the list has
grown, so I'm going to repost it.

My car backfires during upshifts on hard acceleration.  During this process, it
backfires only when I completely lift off the throttle during the upshifts, if
I don't let the pedal all the way up and maintain some engine revs, the car
doesn't backfire.

I'm guessing that the transition from wide open throttle and closed throttle
isn't being taken overly well by my car.  Does anyone have any ideas why?  Is
my car not adjusting properly to closed throttle at high rpms (i.e. running the
engine to lean, causing misfires)?

I'm waiting for new ignition wires, however I don't think those are the
problem.  I haven't yet checked my throttle position sensor (I couldn't find my
meter yesterday).

Thanks!
