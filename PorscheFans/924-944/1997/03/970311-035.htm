In the past i have suffered cam shaft wear on my 924.Could this be 
caused by the oil pressure dropping off when warm?
on initial start up (cold & driveing) pressure is 7-8 bar and idle is 5 
bar.
When the engine warms up pressure drops to 5 bar (driveing) and down to 
as low as 2 bar at idle.
The reason i mention this is because i read a test report on a 924 which
at idle (engine warm) had a oil pressure of 6 bar.
Could my 924 be getting tired at 100,000 miles on the clock?I have had 
the cylinder head reconditioned 15,000 miles ago however.Am i just 
worrying about too much and the pressure is fine as long as it does not 
drop right off...
Any advice would be appreciated especially if it is only say a oil pump 
and not internal to the engine.
