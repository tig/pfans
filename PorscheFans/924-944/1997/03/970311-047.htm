This question is kind of embarrassing, but... on the 924, on the roof
support between the doors and the "back seat" window, there are a bunch of
holes.  Do these holes conceal a speaker?  I rather suspect that they're
blown out, but I'd like to see if I can't replace them to get some
(hopefully) decent sound... the front speaker on the dash is so crappy I
just disconnected the thing.  (It'd vibrate really badly when I turned the
volume up and made resting my hand on the gearshift knob really
uncomfortable.)

I'd always assumed that it was just for decoration, since there's no sound
coming from there, but I've been reading about people who've been saying
there are speakers on the 944 in that vicinity.  And I don't want to take
apart the entire damn car just to find there's foam padding or another
Porsche logo or something under there.

Thanks...
