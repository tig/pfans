Leave 'em alone.  The clear coat will crack and yellow over time.  More 
importantly, polished wheels don't dissipate heat as well as non polished.  If 
he wants to dress 'em up, paint the crests. I think these have crests in the 
center, don't remember as I sold mine.  They were polished.

PFans,

My son is thinking of having his '89 Turbo's  wheels polished and
(possibly) clearcoated.  We've seen several Turbo S and S2 cars in the
Seattle area with polished wheels and they look very nice... not as gaudy
as chrome, but a lot flashier looking.

I'm a bit concerned however about upkeep (for non-clearcoated) and whether
polishing reduces the value of the wheels.  Since the wheels on my son's
car are nick and curb-surf free, I think it might be better to keep them
as is and possibly just pick up a set of 17" wheels and tires when he can
afford them.

What do y'all think?
