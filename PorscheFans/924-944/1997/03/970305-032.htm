Zerex Extreme 450 should indeed be OK.  The Audi and VW seems to like the
Autobahn brand which should be OEM stuff and has nifty additives that suppress
leaks, at least on VWs.  The liquid is bluish.  Mercedes and BMW sell
phosphate-free antifreeze that bears their own badge, that is made by Ashland
Oil, specifically Valvoline, or at least it was so a year ago when I talked to
the guy that runs the lab where they came up with the stuff.  This stuff is
yellowish.  Volvo also sells phosphate-free antifreeze, I do not know what
color it is.

Zerex is probably the cheapest, last I checked the Autobahn was the priciest. 
I have been using the Benz stuff on both the 626 and the 944S with no problems
for two years.

If memory serves me right, on both the VW and the Porsche lists people suggest
staying away from the Sierra eco brand.

1985 Mazda 626LX Touring Sedan
1987 Porsche 944S (soon to have D40 M2's, cannot wait to get rid of the P500s).
