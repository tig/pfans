Hello again,

I live in Atlanta, GA and just went to get my 85.5 944's emissions
inspected so I can get tags.  I've owned this car a whole 2 weeks - it has
82k miles and looks and runs perfect.  The car failed the ispection because
the CO2 was too high at idle - 2.60 when it should have been 1.20. 
Everything else passed at high rpm's and at idle.

Now this car was only driven about 3000 miles last year.  It had a half
tank of gas in it when I bought it.  The first day I filled it up with
Amoco 93 octane and have driven about 300 miles since.  It had a 1/4 tank
when I went to get the car inspected and wasn't extemely warmed up - the
inspection place is about 2 miles from my house.

I ran by Automotive Atlanta and the guy at the parts counter suggested
checking the air cleaner and maybe installing a new set of plugs.  I
checked the maintanence records and it has been about 20k miles since
either has been changed.  I checked the air cleaner and it doesn't look
really bad.  I bought the plugs and I'm going to pick up a new air cleaner
tomorrow (any suggestions on brand? K&N or stock?).  

I've refilled the tank with Amoco 93 and will change the plugs and air
cleaner tomorrow.  I plan to run the car pretty hard prior to taking it for
re-inspection.  

If anyone has any other suggestions I'd be happy to try them.  If it fails
a second time it will cost me $25 for the 3rd inspection.  DMV will give a
waiver once you've spent $200 in repairs but it goes up to $450 next year
so I'd like to get this matter resolved.

Thanks,

Michael Belfoure
85.5 944
