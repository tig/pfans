  I have an 87 944 na with Koni reds all around.  With the front
  shocks set
  to about 1/2 turn off full hard and the rear shocks set to almost
  full hard
  the inside rear wheel would lift in a hard turn and I would smoke
  the tire
  under acceleration.  Things improved when the rear was set to full
  soft
  although improvements are still needed.  Hopefully I have solved the

  problem with the addition of limited slip.  I'll find out this
  weekend.

 You are looking in the wrong place, shocks don't stop roll, roll is a
function of  weight transfer and spring rate.

Will Hartje

Right.  Shocks won't limit the total amount of body roll, they only affect
the rate at which you achieve the total amount of body roll your
springs/torsion bars and sway bars will allow.
