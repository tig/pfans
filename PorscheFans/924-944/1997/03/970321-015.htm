The fans are used to pull air through the radiator. When the car is
sitting at idle, there is no air flow through the radiator, so the
radiator can not cool very well. The fans draw air through the rad, so
it cools better.

When you are driving down the highway, air is forced through the
radiator due to the speed you are traveling. That obviates the need for
the fans to be turning.

On my car, I don't recall the fans being on except when either the A/C
is on, I'm driving in stop and go traffic, or the car is idling for
a long time. I don't ever remember driving down the highway, coming to
a stop, and hearing the fans. That even includes driving on the track
in summer. I've driven during hot days, hot enough to move the gauge to
the upper line. The fans are not on when I pull into the pit, only when
I reach my spot in the paddock.

Barry
