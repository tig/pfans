Hi Steve,
I have an 87 951 without the sunroof, but otherwise fully loaded. LSD,
leather etc.  The (original) PO apparently, was quite tall from the waist up
and exercised the "delete option".  BTW Canadian cars did not have the
airbags as standard fitment until , I believe 1990.
Perhaps we could compare option lists to ascertain if the sunroof was indeed
a "delete"
Thanks

I just bought a 1987 951 US car with no sunroof.  It also has LSD,
trans cooler, Sport susp, sport seats, and I think a smaller diameter
steering wheel (with airbags) though the steering wheel size item may
be my imagination.  It does have A/C , a radio, all the usual power
options and dual-power seats in p-cloth.

Was there a "delete sunroof" option available in 1987?

Was there some option pack that included all this stuff?

I must say I am happy to have it.  The former owner thought
it was some "stripped down" model!

The only other cars I have seen liek this (turbo-no SR) were the escort
cars and the true canadian cup-cars.

Emil...you there?

Thanks!

	Steve
