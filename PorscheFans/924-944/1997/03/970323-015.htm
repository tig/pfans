Actually, you don't need to remove the glove box.  However, it does require
some finesse.

Start by pulling the two knobs off the heater slide switches (ones with the
triangles).  Next pull the plastic center plate off.  Be very careful!
That plate is only one or two microns in thickness.  I you have a dental
tool with a right angle end you can work it out.  There are two snaps that
hold it in the center top and bottom that must be worked out slowly.  That
plastic will split if you look at it wrong.

Next remove the small air vent between the glove box knob and the heater
control assembly.  Rotate that plastic vent anti-clockwise about 1/8 turn.
Next remove the rectangle plate to the right of the glove box knob near the
door.  Remove the side panel (access is with the passenger door open).
There is a single Phillips screw that is in the middle.  Now remove all
Phillips screws that have been uncovered by the above steps.  You must
carefully pull the heater control assembly out to gain access to the last
two screws that hold the long plastic plate were the clock is.

When all the screws are out (should be about 12 screws laying around by
now), carefully work off the long plastic face plate.  Start at the
passenger door end and carefully work the plate over the vent control slide
knob.  It is an interference fit, so take your time.

Next continue to pry the long face plate out with a long slim screw driver
to slowly unsnap the face plate.  As it come loose you will see a rubber
hose that attaches to the back side behind that round vent hole.  If it
doesn't fall off, carefully work it off.  Next take the cigar lighter wires
off.  They are connected on the back with a black rubber plug.

Alas, now the clock!  There is a connector plug that presses on the rear of
the clock for power and lamp power (four connector), pry that off.  You
should be able to pull that plastic face plate out with the clock.  The
clock is secured wit two mini Phillips screws and two plastic snaps on the
top.  Do your thing and replace the new in the old ones place.

The reassemble is just the reverse.  I used a Kelly clamp (hemostat) to
pull that rubber hose out and then fit it to the back of the face plate.
It takes a couple of tries to get it so it doesn't pop off again as you
reassemble.

Replace all the screws and cover plates and sit down and watch time slip by!
