	I have those real neat Rain - 1 tires, yep Hydroplaning at 18 mph 
is cool! Rain make the good drivers stand out and the Bad one ask for a 
tow out of the mud, also helps low hp cars like mine. But it is too wet 
tonight to change tires for me

In my book the 924 Le Mans GTP is shown with the data above...
But you could be right: 1981 matches to both models.

Yes. This is also mentioned in my book...

For those of you who are interested - my source is:

"Das gro=DFe Buch der Porsche Typen"
by Juergen Barth and Lothar Boschen
2nd Edition, 1994
ISBN 3-613-01284-7
Pri[cz?]e here in Germany ~140-150 DM

This are two books with about 1150 pages full of information & photos.
Information is not very technical - but it's more than enough to get
a good overview.
