I have recently become interested in Porsches, and I am trying to decide
which model to get. I would therefore value any advice from those in the
know. I have always been interested in classic cars having owned or driven
the British sports cars of the 60s viz TR3s, MGAs and Austin Healeys. I
fully intended buying a similar car again but realised that I would only
use it over the weekend and in fine weather. Then my thoughts turned to a
Porsche which I could use everyday if I wished to and still have a lot of
fun and be proud to own.

Curently my thinking runs like this : a 924 is a lovely looking car with an
easy to maintain engine but lacks the extra power. A 928 also looks good
but guzzles the gasoline (which is not cheap in South Africa) and is
quicker than I really need. A 911 is a bit too pricey here and again is
quicker than I need and I would be concerned about maintenance costs. Which
leaves the 944 as a good compromise. In reading the FAQs it seems as if I
need to select my car carefully as there are lots of things to look out for
such as cracked manifolds, leaking oil cooler seals etc. Also the selection
in SA is not that large for any Porsche model. Our prices also seem a lot
higher than the US dollar price.

Where can I find comparable power to weight ratios of the various Porsche
models ?
Which body parts are galvanised or aluminium and are there any areas prone
to rust ? Rust is a very real problem as I live on the East coast of SA,
which is reputed to have the worst rust problem in the world.

I realise that thease questions must have been asked many times before and
if anyone can point me in the right direction I will look for myself.
With thanks from a potential new Porsche owner.

Stan Mitchell
Westville South Africa
