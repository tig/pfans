Aye, this mail hits a sore spot.  I owned an '84 944 for a short while, now I
own an '89 951.  With the '84 I could open the throttle all the way and listen
to the engine wind its way up the rpm gauge.  It was fast enough to have fun in
the corners, yet not usually fast enough to get me in trouble.

Now, the '89 turbo is a different story.  If I open the throttle all the way,
the wheels will spin out, the rear end will slide, and I'll be going much
faster than what I really want.  Any hard driving I want to do has to be done
away from any civilization...

The price you pay...
