  My 85.5 NA 944 has an aftermarket EPROM installed in the Motronics
engine management system from the PO.  The original chip was in the
glove box when I purchased the vehicle.  I will be swapping the chips
this weekend to see if I notice any difference in power.  I believe the
aftermarket chip is running the engine a bit rich, as is evident by fuel
economy, and exhaust smell. Most people on this list have suggested
against purchasing the aftermarket chips for non turbocharged vehicles
because it doesn't appreciably increase HP. 

  I have dumped the stock EPROM, all 4096 bytes of it, wow that's
small!  I will be reading the aftermarket chip on Monday, and will
compare the bytes to see how many are different. Since I can't
dissasemble the code, and don't know anything about the Intel micro in
the Motronics unit, I will not get much out of the comparison.  Anyone
have more info?  Has anyone on this list programmed their own?  I
suspect that all the aftermarket chip changed from the stock chip is
overall timing, and Fuel/Air ratio.  I would be surprized if they
created a whole new map as well.

Thanks,
       Ezra (ehall@btv.ibm.com)
