        My 87 944s had the described with the heater "blasting" in my face
regardless of whether I had the a/c on or not, which, in Florida, is a real
inconvenience.  I found that, reaching under the dash, and grabbing the
blower housing and shaking, solved the problem temporarily. A more thorough
exploration under there has lead to what seems to be a permanent fix
although I cannot state with certainty what was done. Push all connections
under there to make sure they are tight, and generally muck around as the
problem seems to be a loose connection which, I assume activates a valve or
switching device.

        I have just begun my education into ball joints for this car. As
best I can tell, after 1986, replacing ball joints is accomplished by
replacing the control arm.  This seems (according to Haynes) to be a
relatively simple task - is this right?? Any driveway mechanics with tips??  

        Finally, my driver's side seat cloth insert is deteriorated and I
was thinking of the neoprene "wet suit" covers advertised in Performance and
Automotion catalogs - good idea or not???
