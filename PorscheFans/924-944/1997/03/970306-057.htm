<< I have an '86 951 with 91,500 miles on it.  I am preparing to take it in
 for the 90,000 mile service.  The last time I visited the dealer for a
 turbo problem they did an inspection of the car for me.  Apparently I have
 an A-arm that is starting to go on the right side of the car.  There has
 always been a shimmy at about 60-65 mph and again over 100.  My main
 concern is that the car pulls to the right most of the time and to the left
 some of the time.  I was told that a four wheel alignment would correct
 this problem.   My question to you is: Should I replace the A-arm before
 the alignment or dosen't it matter.  I would like to put off the
 expenditure for the a-arm as long as I can.
 Also, apparently three of my moter mounts are shot.  The service manager
 told me that this would only result in a rough idle and not to worry about
 it.  Do you agree with this?  >>

Wow!  If I were you I'd look for another service shop!  An alignment would be
a 
waste of money with a worn suspension component. As for the motor mounts,
I'm not sure where the third one is, but if the two I know of are bad (the
one 
under the exhaust manifold usually goes first), you should replace them.
Rough idle is the telltale symptom, but it's not harmless. That vibration can
eventually cause components to break or come loose.  If you do return to the 
same shop, you might want to run any repair estimates they give you past the 
group to make sure you're not getting hosed.
