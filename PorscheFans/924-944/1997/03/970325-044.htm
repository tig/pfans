<< 
 I have recently put a set of the Dynamic European Technologies (713
 661-2780) control arms on my 89 Turbo.  Since the Turbo has the M030
 bushings I had to send the arms in first, but Eric repaired both arms with
 a one day turn around at $149.00 each.
 
 Eric guarantees his work on street or track for 3 years.  I am satisfied
 with his work.  He also supplies Tweeks with their rebuilds.  
 has
 been very happy with his work with zero returns to date.
 
  >>
FYI
I also have used this company and am very happy with the results.
