It's embarrassing to ask but, what the heck. All the good advice given to
me this week filled me with a surfeit of confidence and I went out today to
change the front shocks on my '83 944. Got the car jacked up and on
jackstands. Pulled the left front wheel. Pulled the brake pads...look good,
not ready for replacement. Yay!

Then disaster struck. I *cannot* get the strut lower attachment bolts off
(the ones that connect to the arm just inboard of the brake caliper).
Appears to be about an 18mm nut... and of course my Sears metric socket set
stops at 17mm. I put an adjustable wrench on them but they still wouldn't
move, and I was afraid of rounding the nut heads.

Then I tried to remove the caliper, but those bolts wouldn't come loose
either, even though I had a proper socket.

Questions:

Is this 18mm bolt on the lower nuts?

Any special secrets to taking this thing off? Impact wrench? Small
thermonuclear device? The suckers seem to be on there TIGHT.

The Haynes manual says that you should not reuse the self-tightening bolts
on the lower arm attachment plate but should get a new set. Fine. Where?
I've not seen them anywhere in any catalog.

I have a set of coil spring compressors for the next part of the job, which
I borrowed from my son the "Sierra Hotel" mechanic; but I don't want to
admit I cant get two silly bolts off. He'll tell my grandchildren I'm a
dork, no doubt.... advice/commiseration would be greatly appreciated.
