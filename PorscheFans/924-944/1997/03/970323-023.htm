The woman on the other end of the phone answers, "Auto Club roadside
assistance".  I explain that I would like to have my car towed.  She asks
what is the problem and I state that it has no engine.  When she starts to
question why there is no engine, I indicate it is a Porsche.  For some
reason she requires no further explanation and sends a flatbed.  

My engine builder, whom I refer to as "the master", discusses the Jaguar
repair shop at the end of the building with the tow driver.  The tow truck
driver indicates he has returned the same Jag on the hook to the Jag shop
three times in the last two weeks.  The master mumbles something about
doing the job right the first time as we unload my car.  I peer into the
master's lair and see that the lift is clear.  We should have the engine
in, buttoned up and running in no time.  

A slight change of plans disrupts the instant insertion of the engine.  "I"
am questioned about the whereabouts of the exhaust studs and oil pan bolts.
 "I" did not pull the oil pan or studs so how the hell should "I" know.  I
start rooting through my pile of neatly marked packages of parts in zipper
bags.  (tech tip:  keep solvent away from the magic marker descriptions on
the plastic bags)  Grumbling does not make the lost words any clearer.   My
search yields no results and the master indicates that the expensive gasket
kit is missing some o-rings.  So I'm off to the local Porsche dealer on a
parts run while the master dissects an automatic  transmission.

Spending $6.50 and $5.50 each for two o-rings makes it clear how Porsche
makes up for lowering some of their parts prices.  The best part of the
morning is shot on the parts run.  



When I return to the master's shop, an interloper has claimed the lift.  As
I start to complain, the master indicates it would speed things up if
"someone" could clean the rest of my engine parts in the solvent tank.  I
scan the master's one man shop hoping "someone" will appear.  Well, at
least I am prepared for the hand eating solvent this time.  I don my latex
gloves and pull light nylon inspection gloves over them, the master shakes
his head, obviously jealous of my glove idea.  Scrubbing away, my hands
start to feel like something is eating them.  (Tech Tip:  do not store your
condoms in the solvent tank, solvent is not latex friendly)  If I act
nonchalant, I can strip off the remains of the latex gloves and skip the
chemical composition lecture.  No such luck, Mr. Eagle Eye spots me
brushing off the latex flakes and launches into a 10 minute dissertation on
the chemical structure of solvent and latex rubber and why the twain should
never meet.  As my pile of dirty parts shrinks, I wonder if the Space
Shuttle has as many heat shields as a 944 turbo.

The air/oil separator kit arrives from Jon Milledge.  The final part is in,
we rip open the package!  Looking at the $460 kit spread out on the floor
is not awe inspiring.  Either Milledge had tremendous R&D costs or he has a
large alimony payment to make.  I rationalize this by telling myself it is
insurance. The master is mumbling about Milledge's plumbing diagram and I
head for the Porsche to search out someplace to fit the Accusump.  He has
already redesigned most of the engine, can't he leave anything alone.
  
The next morning finds the master in a less than agreeable mood.  He has
been paid a early morning visit by the county hazardous waste inspector. 
After he launches into a tirade, about how the county is not concerned
about the environment but is only interested in collecting fees, he refuses
to let her inspect his shop and tells her to come back when she has an
appointment.

For someone who has been invited to join Mensa, this is not a brilliant
move.  I do a quick mental calculation weighing the slow moving
incompetence of government verses the speed of a pissed off inspector.  I
determine the master will have my engine installed and dialed in before
they haul him off in handcuffs.

The Porsche finally gives up one of her closely guarded secrets.  I find
that by removing the passenger side plastic wheel well liner, a large
Accusump sized cavity in the back of the well is revealed.  (Tech 
Tip:  Either two kilos of drugs or a three quart accumulator will fit
nicely into the space)  I choose the accumulator.

I mount the accumulator on two 4" x 10" x 1/4" pieces of aluminum which are
welded to look like a "T".  Four bolts go through the top part of the T and
through the kick panel into the cockpit.  An electrically operated valve is
installed and the pressure line is routed into the engine compartment. 
This way the accumulator can be mounted close to the engine while not
inside the car.

The three MSD ignition and boost control modules are mounted under the dash
on the passenger side. The glove box now only holds a pair of gloves.  I
had to cut off most of it in order to fit in the MSD parts.  On the plus
side, all the MSD adjustments can be reached by opening the glove box and
there is even a light.  This thing should be able to throw a spark about
half a block if it ever gets put together.

The sun sets, we are now at T minus 6 days and counting.  The master calls
me into his office to help draw up a fitting list.  The stock oil filter is
too small to please the master.  A remote oil filter is to be installed. 
We look at an Olberg filter like the NASCAR boys run but can not figure out
where to mount it because of its large size.  A quart size filter should
fit in the right front fender well.  As the fitting list is compiled, the
master draws an oil flow diagram and proclaims that the air/oil separator
kit plumbing is wrong.  We go into the shop and unscrew the stock oil
filter and see not one but two return holes.  He is right, only part of the
frothy oil is going to the air/oil separator with the rest dumping back
into the crankcase.  The master is on a mission from God now.  Time stands
still as he draws a new oil plumbing system while explaining it to me in
complete detail.  The night wears on with food and engine installation
forgotten.  

As I start a weary drive home, a thought strikes me.  I am starting to
understand what the master is saying.  This is becoming stranger and
stranger, twilight zone next stop.
