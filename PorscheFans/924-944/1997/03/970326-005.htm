Sure 
First take an acetylene torch.... no wait wrong project.
Ok here is the procedure I use on a step by step basis.
1) remove rear quarter window. As it turns out the window is held in place by a rubber gasket that also makes up the out side trim. (yes the outside trim is all one piece with the inside rubber!) I found that by prying up the gasket with a flat blade screw driver starting form the lower rear corner while applying pressure(towards the outside) was the best method. Don't worry if you see the interior rubber changing color - it's old. A little vinylex will put it back to new. (I don't know how this might effect cars that live in arid areas, they maybe more dried out that mine. You might want to try a test area.)
2) Remove the quarter panel - you can see all the screws - there are 4 or 5. There is one of those plastic anchors near the top front area - use large flat blade to pry out so you don't damage panel.
3) Remove the plastic plug half way up the rear pillar - Phillips head. This looks like a seat belt anchor point for shoulder harness.(?)
4) Remove the windlace at the front edge of the trim panel. This stuff is pretty strong so don't worry if you need a little force.
5) The rear seat latching post can be removed or you can try to maneuver the panel over this. (rear seat has to be down)
6) Remove panel! I left the seat belt in place through the panel. There is enough slack available so that the panel can be place in the rear cargo area while you are working.
Installation - Reverse of above. The only tricky part of the installation is the window. I started by installing the front edge of the window first making sure that the exterior front edge of the trim was correctly in place. (you will see a lip which the trim connects to) Then work your way to the lower rear corner alternating between the top and bottom. The  technique that I used was to pry the gasket over the lip with a flat blade screw drive and push the gasket in place by hand. The screw driver can be slid from front to back with the other had following it making sure the gasket is in place. The only tricky area is the final corner. I found the my gasket was very flexible and even a great deal of prying pressure did not damage it.
It worked for me!
