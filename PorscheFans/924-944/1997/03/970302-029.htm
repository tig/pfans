I assume you've already checked that your timing belts are still intact?
If so, read on!

I had this happen about a year and a half ago and from what I was able to
determine, it has to do with the cranking speed.  If the DME isn't
convinced that you're cranking at least 200 RPM, it will flatly refuse to
fire the plugs and the injectors.  A safety feature, I suppose.  Here's a
test you can do: get a battery charger/booster and hook it up to your car.
If, with the booster connected, your car fires up, then you have the same
problem I had.  The problem?  Apparently the hard starting was a symptom of
the oil-pressure relief valve going bad.  It was going bad because my oil
cooler seals were leaking and the resulting oil/water sludge was clogging
the free movement of the valve.

If you've already updated you oil seals, update the oil-pressure relief
valve to the new, one-piece unit.  If you haven't updated the seals, do it
now while the car is parked and DO NOT make the mistake of trying to reuse
the old pressure-relief valve!  They're practically impossible to correctly
reinsert, even with the proper tools and the risk isn't worth the $200 for
the newer valve.  In my case, the reinserted three-piece oil pressure valve
jammed wide open and blew out the side of the oil filter, all over the
exhaust manifold.  Someone else on the list was less fortunate: they blew
their head gasket.  The moral: update to the newer-style valve!  I'll get
off the soapbox now...

>- speed and TDC sensors are putting out correct waveforms and voltages as

This is the first thing to check, and it was the problem at one time in my
car.  The TDC sensor is really tough to see a waveform on unless you've
pulled it and inserted it into the speed slot-- the
one-pulse-per-revolution of the TDC sensor makes it impossible to measure
the waveform unless you have sophisticated equipment.  I personally don't,
so I instead checked resistance between two of the three prongs.  It ended
up being a game of "one of these things is not like the other" and I was
able to determine that one of the two flywheel sensors was bad.  I checked
the readings for the speed sensor with an AC voltmeter right at the end of
the wire, not at the DME.  I would be hesitant to plug and unplug things
right at the DME.  Double check that *both* sensors are working correctly.

Hope some of this helps...  Let us know what happens.
