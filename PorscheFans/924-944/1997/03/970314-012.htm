Hi, Neil, 

Well, I can't think that it would be the DME (but more about
that later)...

My guess is that you have some carbon buildup in your combustion chamber
that has contributed to detonation (which is what pinging really is)...

You might try some different fuel from a different station (but, keep in 
mind that a lot of stations get filled from the same tanker truck...)

There was a case recently here on the East Coast where a chain of gas
stations was charged with selling 87 octane gas as 92 octane gas, and 
pocketing the difference in price...

Now for the other info about the DME... I found this in my archives,  and
thought that it might help, in case an adjustment of the DME might help...


     There is a provision on the Motronic cars (944 and 911) to 
     make small adjustments to the fuel mixture (injection 
     pulsewidth) and the ignition timing  in order to 
     compensate for the quality of fuel available in your 
     particular country or region.
       
     There is an on-board 8-position rotary switch accessed 
     thru the little hole in the back side of the DME box.
     These adjustments can be made without opening the cover of 
     the DME box, unless you have a California vehicle, which 
     will probably have a metal plug over the hole instead of a 
     plastic fitting.  The switch has a triangular-shaped 
     recess in which to insert a special adjustment tool--i 
     just whittle down a golf tee to make mine.
     
     The switch has detent positions so you can count the 
     clicks to tell where you are set.  All the DME boxes i've 
     ever seen have been set on position #1, so i call that the 
     stock position.  The adjustments can be found in the 
     following table:
     
     Switch         Fuel Mixture        Ignition Timing
     Position       Adjustment          Adjustment
     
     Stock          0                   0
     2              +3%                 0
     3              +6%                 0
     4              -3%                 0
