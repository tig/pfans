Hooray!

Someone (Richard Burns) finally asked a question about the 968!  Yes, you're
right, it is possible to read the list for weeks without any mention of this
model.

I think that the note from Sunday about the small number of 968s out there as
well as their relative newness explains this (not too many parts wearing out
yet) is correct.  In addition, these cars are more expensive than the 951s,
so owners may be tinkering less and letting the dealer or professional
mechanic do more.

With regard to upgrading from a 944S to a 968, I will offer an opinion.
 Unless you want to modify a 951 for extra boost (which I suspect runs the
risk of decreasing reliability significantly), the 968 is a better all-around
performer.  The motor is very torquey, and I can get good acceleration from
about 1500 rpm.  This often makes shifting unnecessary, or I can leave it in
6th gear on the highway and still accelerate nicely.  The six-speed is fun as
well.

I have owned mine only since December, but no problems so far to speak of.

With regard to price, mine was less than $20k for a 92 with 49k miles.  Most
of the examples I see advertised have lower miles and cost $25-30k, at least
as an asking price.  Check out www.Jeffsmotorcars.com for 2 pretty ones, a 93
with custom paint and interior (about 25k miles) for $26k and a 94 with 15k
miles for $28k.  Jeff's is near Cleveland.  I'll be jealous if any of you
buys either one!

I'd be happy to answer any specific 968 questions directly, to the best of my
limited ability.
