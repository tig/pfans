I changed my fuel filter and could not believe how much better the car
ran... the old filter seemed twice as heavy as the new one... it idles
better and some of the hesitation vanished... I mention this because it's a
$15 part and esy repair that may have been neglected... of course, your
problem may or may not be more major than this... also, I never drive the
car hard at all when cold... remember that oil takes about twice as long as
water to heat up, so when your water shows operating temp for the first
time, your oil is only halfway there... also, I get low 20 in gas milage,
so 17 is a little low...

a word on Porsche cars and engines... first, your car only has 143HP so, no
it's not real fast... also, Porsche cars are road cars, not stoplight
racers... if your mad about losing to the Mustang LX 5.0 at the stoplight
last night, don't be, that car blows your car away in that pure
accelleration game... I have a 1987 944, and basically, I give up under
30mph... the beauty of this car is between 30mph and 110mph while hanging
around 4000rpm amd, of course, the twisty roads...

also, I think most Porsche cars are pretty dependent on their camshafts for
power, when the cam kicks in around 4000rpm, the engine is ready to let
go... it's kinda two engines for the price of one... the under 4000rpm
version which I use to drive around town (I rarely exceed 4000 in my daily
driving and keep with the pace of traffic well) and the over 4000rpm
version which gets down in its own way... I remember my first ride in a
1977 911s... lah lah lah borinnngggg whoah 4000 rpm zip the engine turned
from docile to a redline ripper... the problem is it's hard to enjoy this
"feature" of the engine in normal street driving due to the cops, joggers,
mailboxes, trees, other cars, etc.
