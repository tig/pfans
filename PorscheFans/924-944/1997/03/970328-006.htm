Hi all. I have a 1985 1/2 944 and have a few issues to clear up.

1. Porsche mechanic says my AC is shot...first place to start, he
says, is replacing the "receiver-dryer" and then charging the
system, which is now empty. Wants $156 for the part and two
hours labor. Tweeks has the part for $29 or something. Any trick
to doing the replacement myself and then having an approved
shop charge the system? Other places have the part for $185 or
so, so dunno why Tweeks is so cheap.

2. My alarm switch (the key on the driver side) is now shorted out
according to the mechanic. It worked for five seconds...then when
my metal key touched it, it fried, he said. Wants $130 for a new 
switch, key, etc. Anyone have a better source or even A source? I have
not found the switch in the catalogs.

3. Getting ready to remove my sunroof for the first time...it goes up and
down fine. Since I have no manual, anyone have a step by step of how to
take it out?

4. Last but not least...my front struts are shot, he says. Is this a do it
yourself
deal or should I pay a pro?

Thanks for all your help!
