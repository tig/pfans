Hi All,

I just purchased a 1990 S2 yesterday and want to change the oil this weekend
to get off to a fresh start. I use Mobile 1 in my 911 and Ducati and plan to
use it in this car as well.  Would the 15w50 be the proper viscosity for a
water pumper?  I was planning on an interval of 10,000 miles.  Any input
here would be appreciated.  The car may see a driver's school once or twice
a year and is located in North Carolina (lowest winter temp about 10 deg. F
and highest summer temp about 100 deg. F).

Another question I have is about braided stainless brake lines.  I don't
need to be preached to about their (debatable) inappropriate street use.
I've used them on 2 914's, my current 911, and several motorcycles.
Inspection and maintenance are not issues in my case.  My question:  Are SS
lines compatible with ABS systems?  What is the downside?  Could the ABS
unit be damaged?  Are there any caveats regarding the bleeding of ABS systems?

TIA,
-Bill Tomko
