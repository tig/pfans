     Thanks for the reply.  Steve Vojkovic mentioned that put in some JBL 
     speakers that fit and sound good.  I noticed that the AutoAtlanta 
     catalog has a pair of JBL 4x6 for $59, but since they won't take them 
     back I've been holding off til I heard about them or any others.
     
     Ted

Well Early style interior cars are pretty easy, you can get separatres 
in the door no problem but for the new style the only way to get a set 
of high performance separates in the door is a set of pods.
