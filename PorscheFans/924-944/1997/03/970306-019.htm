Ditto!  I am 25, tho.


Just got my Guards Red '83 (I think) yesterday.  Hot Damn!  That was 
fun.  I played tag with a Carrera4 on the way to work.  I've never been 
able to feel the tug of acceleration when I was already going 60 before ;>.
I thought per federal regulations, speedometers only went to 90.  What 
years were those?  I thought I would be getting one with that malady, but 
mine goes to 160.  How hard is it to fix the gauges?  My gas gauge pops 
in and out of accurate reading an empty reading.  My oil pressure gauge 
sometimes has a light, other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it gives an 
accurate reading, sometimes it's at 0 (I hope that wasn't for real).  
What is the little dial below the stereo on the part where the shifter 
is?  What is the far left switch behind the shifter (probably different 
for every car, right?).  The car shifted great until I let my fiance's 
father drive it (he hasn't driven a stick in a long time, made obvious by 
his performance), and it hasnb't sounded normal since.  I get a "thunk" 
when I accelerate now, not when I engage the clutch, but when I give it 
gas after engaging.  Is that a U-joint problem?  One day...multiple 
problems...here I go, I am a Porsche owner!
