Well,

We finally got the alignment straightened out (yes, the pun was intended).
It seems that it was the first shop's alignment machine that was out of
whack.  I called around until I found a shop that used Hunter or Bosch 
alignment machines and came upon a shop that has sponsored our racing
club in the past, AMG - Performance Motor Group.  Not only do they have
a very sophisticated machine, but they also have a highly knowledeable
person doing the adjustments.  He set the rear settings slightly off
because he knew the settings he would dial in up front would make them
come up perfect!

And they did.  The only settings we couldn't get was the rear toe.  Because
of the amount of lowering, it looks like I can't get 0 toe, but I was able
to get a little over 1/16" toe-in total so that is fine.  

Anyhow, the car rides great and feels good.  We cranked the caster as high
as it would go but still even left and right and managed 2.8 degrees.

Just thought I'd let you know.  I've got 5 hours booked on the dyno once
the unit is installed so I'll keep you informed on the date they give me
and any of you in the area can come by and see the results as they happen.

Farzaan.
