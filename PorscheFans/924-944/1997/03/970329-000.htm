>>Weellll, you could always try getting the CO properly set.    Any shop
with

flow

>>Dave

Yes I could just run to the shop everytime something is wrong with the car
but the main reason I don't want to do this is because the car runs perfect
and I'm not convinced it needs an adjustment.  I used to have access to an
analyzer a couple of years ago when I had to adjust the twin carbs on my
MGs.  I could do this myself if I had the equipment.  

I also read in the Haynes Emissions manual that the 944 doesn't have a
oxygen sensor replacement light/timer and should be changed every 60k
miles.  Has anyone else ever heard this?  

I do appreciate the reply Dave and I will take the car to Automobile
Atlanta for the adjustment if the car doesn't pass next time.  As I
mentioned before it was the folks at Automobile Atlanta who suggested I
first check the items above - they could have just as easily talked me into
an hour of shop time.  This is why I came to the list to see if there is
any additional items I should check.

Thanks so much,

Michael Belfoure
