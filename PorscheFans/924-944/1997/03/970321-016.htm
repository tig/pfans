	Barry, whoa this is weird. My fans work entirely different from
	yours! This may be because of the Cooling Problem from Hell but
	I am almost certain my fans have always worked this way i.e.
	before I started experiencing the Problem. I start the car from
	cold (sitting overnight) and start driving. If I drive on the
	street, temps, will usually stay around the first slender hash
	mark...maybe a little higher, and fans won't come on. After awhile
	of driving like this, temp. needle creeps up to halfway and stays
	there. Fan 1 kicks in at this point and usually brings the temp.
	back down, then kicks off. If I start the day's driving by getting 
	on the freeway, car rapidly gets to the first slash mark, stays
	there for 5-10 minutes, then begins to creep up to the middle of
	the two slash marks. Fan 1 kicks in at this point.Temp. needle
	stays there for awhile, then often begins to go up again,
	sometimes as high as the second slash mark which causes fan 2
	to kick in. This "feature" has been alleviated somewhat by the
	WaterWetter I just put in. Anyway, the gauge stays up there with
	both fans running even though I'm doing 80+ on the highway. You
	see where I'd get the idea that the fans were integral to cooling
	on the highway...

	Note that this is with the heat *on*! I'd hate to see what the
	temps. are going to be like when it gets hot down here and I
	have to turn the heat off. Looks like I'm going to be forced to
	track down this little problem once and for all before much
	longer. Thanks for the explanation!
