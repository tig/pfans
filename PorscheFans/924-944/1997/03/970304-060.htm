anyone know if this is adjustable? Has anyone else had a similar slipping
problem? Does anyone else disassemble their car for such mundane things? If
some nice soul out there  who is as fanatic (wacko) as I could tell me how
many ft lbs (inch/pounds is more likely) it takes to manually operate their
sun roof? 

Well, as a matter of fact, I was fixing my sunroof this weekend, and I
remember most of what the manual said. If you have the tools it's easy
enough to check.

Retract the cable a bit from the fully closed position. Check the torque on
the large nut (behind the little plastic cover) that you can see turn when
the motor turns. It takes a 21mm socket. Torque is 6 newton-meters +/- 0.5
(it was a good excuse to get a small torque wrench). Check it in both
directions after overcoming the initial "striction."

Yes, it's adjustable. Loosen the outer (locking) nut of the two small nuts
on the same shaft by holding the inner nut (with a thin wrench; I think 12
or 13mm size) while you back off the outer one. Turn the inner nut IN VERY
SMALL INCREMENTS (said the manual); I think counterclockwise for less
torque, clockwise for more. Get the torque right and then tighten the outer
(locking) nut while holding the inner. 

My clutch torque checked out perfect; just had to adjust the limit switches,
which had come loose (and replace the nylon gears that had been stripped,
apparently as a result of the switches being out of adjustment). If you need
those tolerances, I have them handy (and even converted to inches).

Good luck.
