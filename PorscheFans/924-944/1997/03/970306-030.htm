Lots of nasty surprises from the dealer in Bellevue, WA. It was supposed
to be a routine belt tension and some minor stuff but I ended up with a
bill for $3500 and a service date 2 weeks from now! I will ask the list
for advice and give the gory details later, but I do need some immediate
tips on the following:

1. It has been raining continuously and my rear wiper does not work. The
console switch is fine and it receives power. The motor is fine and does
not receive power. The fusebox fuse is ok so there is a break in power
somewhere between the switch and the wiper motor. Is there a relay or fuse
somewhere in the circuit?

2. Gas mileage was down so I asked the dealer to check mixture against
specs. They did something, and on the trip from Seattle, at a steady 80mph
in 420 miles I got an incredible 25 miles/gallon! Now ordinarily I would
be happy about this, but is this normal? Is there any chance they leaned
the mixture too much -- I am paranoid about detonation. Besides, I have
always been told there is no way to adjust the mixture besides swapping
the DME, so how exactly did they do it?

3. I was also told the Oxygen sensor is bad and needs replacement -- what
are the symptoms for this? My car has no problems cold starting, doesn't
stumble. It does have a slight idle hunt (between 900 and 925 RPM), but if
the Oxygen sensor were bad wouldn't the mixture be permanently over-rich?
Fuel consumption on the MPG gauge does change in my car, from a gallon+ an
hour cold to less than 0.5 gallons/hour warm.

4. Dealer also recommended a new w/pump, new belts and rollers. Now, the


belts and rollers are less than 10 months and 6k miles old (from Vertex)
and I don't lose any coolant at all. There is a small oil leak from the
cam seals, so I can see why the belts need to be changed, but the w/pump?
How dangerous is it to have a little oil on the belts? TIA. More nasty
details soon.

PS: Many list members asked about Swepco -- Barrier Porsche in Bellevue,
WA (206-643-3000) does indeed have it -- $40/gallon. I am not that
impressed with it though -- the car shifts harder than it used to cold
(used to have Pennzoil 80W90 in the transaxle), but warm shifting is
normal. The 5th gear idler rattle is much reduced, almost gone, but I
would rather trade a rattle for better cold shifts.
