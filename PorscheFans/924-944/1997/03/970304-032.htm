I write in response...
I don't agree.  The downshift to first is really hard on the car, even with
a match rev downshift, and it's a pain in the butt.  The car can maintain enough
momentum that a downshift to 1st is not necessary.  The key I think is the
tire choice, a 17" 255/40R17 street tire is geared taller than stock and
also does not allow as much speed to be carried through.  If you are
running a 245/45R16 R-tire, then you can hold more speed through the corner
putting you into a better rev range and as with all turbo cars, you really have
to get on the throttle right after braking to get the boost up on the exit.

Also, on another note, I absolutely loved that post from the new 89 951 owner.
That is exactly how I feel about my car.  When I haven't had a chance to drive
it hard for a couple of days, I get really upset and then take it out on
the weekend to a mountain drive.  If I don't get my fix for the week, I'm
not in a good mood for the whole week :)

Farzaan.
