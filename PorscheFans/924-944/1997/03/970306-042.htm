the official Porsche manuals that sell for $350 for the 6 volumes...

are these things the word? do they have any troubleshooting tips or only
procedures? are they well illustrated/written etc?

+ + +

I need to correct an internal coolant loss resulting in oily sludge in the
coolant and coolant yuck in my oil (not as funny as "hey, you got peanut
butter in my chocolate... mmm... delicious) and I need to replace the
cam/balance shaft belts... no way do I even think about doing this armed
with only the Haynes manual (which I've read cover to cover at least four
times)...

I fear that this job is going to cost me around $2k (give or take a few
hundred...probably take)... I'm prepared for that, but hell, if I bought
manuals and that stupid-ass $500 belt tensioning mechanism, I'd still have
$1200 for parts and I'd own both the manual/tool and the knowledge to do
these fixes my self, and perhaps I'd become open to buying a higher
maintenace turbo version or just collect and hoard 'em all... well, all is
not rosy, I have no experience touching heads/clutches/transmissions...
though, I've done near most everything else on a car...

+ + +

what I need to know:

1. how possible is it that I'm in over my head? I want to learn, but, it's
tough getting the experience... I don't want to count a trashed head as
"experience" even if the manuals are detailed to the hilt, I assume it's
still likely to find myself crying in the front yard laying on my back with
greasy black hands waiting for lightning to claim my soul...

2. I don't really know what I'd be trying to do... my intial strategy is:

a. replace as many gaskets, replace as many seals around balance shaft
belts, camshaft covers, and oil cooler as possible...

b. flush frontwards, backwards and sideways the block and everything else
involving oil or coolant... probably replace the water pump (though I think
it's fine)... since I'm doing the work, and I'm in crazy parts of the
engine anyway, I should blow any money I would have saved on labor on
parts, right?

c. replace the radiator (the drain plug is stripped anyway)

3. those damn belts... are they really as difficult to get right as I hear?
I'd replace the rollers and stuff while I was doing this, so access should
be a little easier than some of the stories I've read about...

4. not being a trained eye, I would not be able to identify problems as
readily as an experienced person (like the bearings- are my bearings shot?
I hear that this oil/coolant problem ruins the bearings, but how would I
know?)... I think this part bugs me the most... I do the job, get the car
back on the road and something I should have seen screws up and ruins most
of what I did... again, putting me in the yard waiting for death...

+ + +

hmm... re-reading the above has me thinking "take it in", but, on the other
hand, doing it myself seems a vital first step in lifelong Porsche
ownership... I like working on my car, but how do you get to the next level
of the shadetree? I have no friends with more experience or interest than
me...

any tips on having an experienced person available to me to get me through
the difficult moments? I've thought about trying to approach Porsche shops
as a volunteer part time shop helper, thinking that if I could even see the
work being done, the benefit would be enourmous... but, after I imagine
myself as the shop owner I can't really see swinging this deal...

should I take it in this time, but in the meantime look for a $2500 1984
Porsche that's a little on the tired side to "experiment" on, or is this an
invitation to the bottomless pit?

Am I destined to buy a Saturn?

hey, thanks in advance to all who care to discuss my plight...
