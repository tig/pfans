Here is some thoughts I have on the costs of these cars.  I think we are all a
little particular about how our cars run and look.  This leads to additional
costs.  I recently bought new hood shocks, not really because I needed them, a
piece of wood held up the hood just fine, but because I'd like to have as much
of my car working as possible.

All these little things add up.  There is also the potential fear of possible
catastrophic problems (engine).  This usually makes us go the extra step, and
buy that water pump before we really need to, or change our oil every 500
miles, etc...

I guess my point is that we are always going to spend over a thousand dollars a
year on our cars.  I'm getting to the point where I get bored if I don't have
something coming from UPS, I'm always looking for this little part or that
little part.  I don't think any of us has an absolutely perfect car.  I've
probably spent well over $1000 on my car, and nothing really has gone wrong
with it (call me a fool).  I probably put $2000 into my other 944 ('84 944),
and I didn't even really fix anything (shocks, dressed up the interior,
etc...).  It still was a peice of crap.  I bought the car for $3600, put about
$2000 into it, and sold it for $2500.  All in the span of 7 months.

I feel the biggest benefit I'm getting out of my car is the experience of
working on it, and learning how it works, and learning what items make a
difference when it comes to repairing it...

Yes, we can probably avoid the big things by checking out the car.  Meaning
clutch, transmission, engine.  However I feel we'll always be going after the
little things, and putting endless amounts of money into items that have no
particular use but to make us feel good  (such as that so called sunroof),
making sure my seats go up and down, etc...

Have fun all!!!
