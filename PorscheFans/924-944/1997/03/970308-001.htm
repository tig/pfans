Hi, PorscheFans,

The anodizing on my factory forged Turbo S wheels is beyond hope.  I was planning on 
bead blasting and painting them as a short-term solution.  However, I saw a car with 
polished wheels and they looked pretty decent.  I prefer the stock finish, but I don't 
want to spend the $135 per wheel (plus shipping) right now to have them re-anodized.  A 
friend can remove the old anodizing with his bead blaster and I could polish the wheels 
myself.  Before I start, though, I was wondering if anyone on the list has done this 
themselves and can offer any advice on tools and polishing compounds?  Also, can 
polished wheels later be re-anodized?  Thanks.

Mike Fields
'88 944 Turbo S
