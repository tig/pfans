I recently purchased a 1980 924 and need to do some work on it.  I would 
appreciate any feedback that you might have.

Antenna:
1)  I have a 1980 924 and need to replace the antenna.  My problem is how 
do I get the antenna out?

Radio:
2)  I've got a Blaupunkt Boston SQR49 FM/AM Cassette Player.  It would 
seem as though the person that I purchased the car from decided to do a 
little wiring job that pretty much mucked everything up.  Now I have to 
install the stereo and am not sure as to where all the wires should go.

The following are the wires on the stereo:
Red - Power Cord w/ 10A Fuse Holder
Yellow -  Back Up Cord
White -  Code Led Cord
Orange/White -  Dimmer Cord
Blue - Auto Antenna
Black - Ground

I have found one available power line in the car, it is live at all 
times.  It seems to run off of the Cigarette Lighter and Hazard Light 
fuse, which is red and stems from a plastic connector behind the heater 
control casing.

Another wire is hot only when the lights are on, which is blue/white.

And a third that seems to be attached to a ground, which is brown.

Any suggestions as to how to wire this thing?

Tires:
3)  I've got the 185/70 HR14 rims on the 924 and need to purchase new 
tires.  Any suggestions on a good brand and model for the        924?  
Should I look to go to a larger tire?  I also need to replace the shocks 
and springs, what brand / model would you suggest.

Fuel, Coolant, Temperature Gauge
Is there and easy way to get this out of the dash?  The temperature gauge 
is red lined as soon as the car is started.  I suspect that the gauge is 
faulty and needs replacing.  Could it be something else?

Any information that can be passed on would be greatly appreciated as I 
am a first time Porche owner and would love to get the care back in good 
running condition.

Thank you,

Rob Rogers
