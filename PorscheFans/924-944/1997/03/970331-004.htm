Turbo dudes,

New technology from Mitsubishi might change the way turbos work in 
production cars in the future.

It's Anti-lag in production cars.  The car dumps it's pressurized air
from the intake pipes on closed throttle situations into the exhaust
manifold.  When the pressurized air hits the hot turbine in the exhaust
manifold and the over-rich mixture get in there, it creates an
explosion, something similar to combustion.  This explosion keeps
the turbo spinning and keeps boost during shifts.  Have you ever seen
WRC rally racing?  When they shift, it lets some fire out the exhaust
and you hear a pop noise, that's the anti-lag system.  It's very
smart technology that works very, very well.  

Boost usually stays as high as 10psi during off throttle situations.
The pressurized air is taken from the compressor bypass valve.  This
system would create a few psi of boost off idle in first (the CBV always
leaks a bit at idle under vacuum), but the main benefit would be at
full throttle, closed throttle shifts where you shift quickly to retain
boost, this would no longer be needed, you could take it pretty easy and
still have 10+psi of boost in your next gear.  This system is standard
equipment on the Mitsubishi Lancer EvoIV.  Expect it to debut on the
Mitsu Eclipse in the future (the engines are identical except for some
hop up parts, 16G turbo, etc.)

Farzaan.
