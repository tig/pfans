I believe you have the same calipers as the 951's, which have only a spring
retainer on the rear of the caliper to hold the pads in place. This is the
procedure I use: (Please note that I am not a concours person: if you are,
this procedure may result in scratche on the calipers)

1. Using vice grips or a good pair of pliers, grasp the spring in the
intersection point to slip the upper spring out from under the retaining clip.

2. Open the vice grips until you can grasp the tabs on the pads and the side
of the caliper and squeeze. You don't need to move the pads much, just
enough to loosen them.

3. Grasp the tabs on the pads with the vice grips and pull the pads out.

4.  Push the pistons back as described in the Haynes manual, or use any
method you are comfortable with (the idea is to not use the rotors as a
leverage point, but if you are careful and use a big screwdriver or pry bar,
a little pressure on the rotor will probably not do it great harm--I do it
that way).

5.  Slide the new pads in. If you are installing Metal Masters in the rear
calipers, they will probably need a shim to keep from rattling. Use a thin
piece of aluminum and slide it under the rear pads. 

6. Replace the spring retainers.

7. This is a good time to bleed/flush your brakes. Remember, before you move
the car, get in it and pump the brake pedal until it gets hard. It's
embarrassing (and dangerous) to hop in the car, back it out of the garage,
step on the brakes and then find out you have no pedal and no brakes.

Once you have changed the pads on this type of caliper, you will wonder why
all calipers are not designed this way. So effective but so simple!
