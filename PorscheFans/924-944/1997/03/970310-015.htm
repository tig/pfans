Pelle,

My 924 had, and my 944 still has the problem where exhaust gas enters the
passenger cabin. I fixed it on the 924 by replacing the rear hatch seal.
Over the years, the seal will spread apart and create a gap that you can
plainly see when the hatch is up. I surmise that when you open a window,
you create a vacuum which would tend to suck more air/exhaust into this
opening. Regardless, my car exhibits this same symptom. I'm budgeting for
this fix on my 944 by this summer. It's an expensive part, though, and
doesn't even make the car faster! Anybody out there found a good cheap
source lately? Hope this helps.

On a semi-related note, do all you 924/944 guys with spoilers notice how
dirty the rear of the car gets? I had a friend with a non-spoilered 924
and he didn't get dirty nearly as fast as me. I think the spoiler tends
to keep exhaust circulating around close to the car somehow. I bet cars
with spoilers have more "exhaust smell" problems too. Still, I'd rather
die from CO poisoning than be spoilerless. That might be a slight
exaggeration.

Good luck,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White w/ soot covered rear bumper
