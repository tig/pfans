1> how does rear coil over work and what are the advantages vs.
costs??  
-----------
There are springs that attach to the shocks.  The springsact
like...well..springs.  Advantages - mainly you can go WAY stiffer than
torsion bars, and the flex in the trailing arm is no longer a factor in
the spring rate.  23/30 torsion bars work out to about 250/280 lbs/in
Springs can be had 100->1000 lb.in.  You can also have progressive springs 
or stacked coils which change the spring rate.

Springs themselves are inexpensive.  Eibach charges $99 per pair.
It's the supporting hardware that gets expensive.

On a 911, for example, you'll need coil-over shocks (like RSR).  Those
will set you back $400ish.  Then you need an upper spring mount.  Look
at another $100.  The lower perches should be included with the shocks,
which take 2.25 or 2.5 springs.

The factory RSR3.8 cars run in the neighborhood of 1000 lb /in springs.

Front - the story is the same, only you need RSR type struts, some more
substantial upper strut mounts and an upper spring perch.  On the 951
models you're already covered.

One caveat - going with stiff springs (on a 911 anyway) means that
you'll soon rip the front and rear upper mounts off the car.  C2 has no
T-bars, and a stiffer upper mount.  Reinforcing with connection
direclty to the cage is preferable, and cross-bracing the cage should
also be performed.

Benefits - stiffness = flatness.  Too-stiffness = too bounceness!

2> someone mentioned that the rear torsion bars could be turned down.
How does that work and is there any harm to the vehicle??

I THINK I know what you're asking:

Basically they are installed so they are "neutral" which is kinda weird
because they act as negative springs as the suspension unloads.  This
ends up giving you 2 spring rates - S + T below neutral and S-T above.
The problem with this is that the splines are designed to be constantly
loaded and excessive wear at the spline can occur.

I simply removed all my torsion bars.

3> how do  you adjust the yellow konis?? jus tfound that i had them after
checing the brakes this weekend. i got a little curious and started to
scrape the black (paint, not) road garbage off and there were lovely
yellow konis that say KONI adjustable.

Take 'em out.  If they're hydraulic the adjustment occurs at full
bottom.  If they're gas, they may work that way, or there may be a
button you have to push.  I've seen both types on 951 cars.  If they are OEM
and the car is not a turbo S they should be hydraulic.  I believ only the aftermarket ones have the button.


4> is there a correct place to put the jack stands so that the underside
of the car is not damaged???

On the stubs that stick out fron the torsion tube (past the springplates) or on the torsion tube itself.

TIA
