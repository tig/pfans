Stu,

        I don't know if this will be of any help, but it may give you an
idea of what the problem may be.  In my 951 (similar wipers to your 924, if
I'm not mistaken), I don't drive much in the rain.  And so I rarely use my
wipers, especially my rear-windshield one.  When not in use, the wipers sit
on the glass in the position last left by the motor after the last time one
uses them- where the blade is actually not perpendicular to the glass
surface but at a slight angle.  This, of course, is due to the way the
rubber blade drags across the glass before it changes direction and swings
the other way.  In any case, leaving the blade in this position undisturbed
for even a few days (and having the blade come to rest in the same position
after each use) can deform the blade enough that it then becomes
"predisposed" to this angle.  The scraping you hear is the sound of the
blade trying to "flip" over on to its other side after it changes direction
and continues in its sweep.  A blade that is biased to leaning on one side
is thus more difficult to turn over and work effectively because it keeps
trying to overcome that angle as it sweeps and may never actually flip over
in its entire arc!  (Because of this fact, my wipers "scraped" more in one
direction than they did in the other).
        I also tried replacing my blades with new ones.  This worked for a
while, but the "scraping" sound resumed once the new blades had become
"conditioned" to their new resting angle.  Unless you get a lot of rain, you
may just want to make a habit of lifting your wipers off the glass the day
after it rains and return them in a more upright position.  This has helped
my wiper problem dramatically.
        Also, do your wipers scrape all the time or does the noise cease
after a few minutes of driving?  My wipers tended to stop scraping after a
few minutes of use because the rubber blades became more pliable with
continued use and were able to turn over and drag across the glass properly.
        This problem happens to many wipers, not just on Porsches, but it is
rather annoying.  Right now, I'm trying to figure out a way to make my
wipers more effective at around 100 mph because they seem like they float on
the glass rather than cling to them at these speeds (maybe one of those
small plastic fins to keep the blades against the glass?)
        I hope this info may help you solve your problem.  Good luck!
