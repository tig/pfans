>appropriate 
oil pan baffling for an '86 951 which will (hopefully)
get 8 to 10 track days per year at SE US tracks.
Major enhancements are/will be a cage, chip, R1's,<

I have researched the elusive #2 rod bearing problem for the past 6 months with
the following conclusion: No one knows for sure what the cause is.  

 My builder (the master) and Jon Milledge spent 2 hours on the phone last week
discussing this along other 944 engine issues.  Jon indicated the central oil
galley, which is tapered from each end due to the casting process, caused the #2
oil passage to be drilled off line, thus trapping air.  We inspected my block,
ran rods up the oil passages and found only #1 to be slightly off.  As my 87
engine has the updated baffle, the master surmises that the factory also changed
their drilling angle on good old #2.  

The majority of unlucky souls I have talked to who have spun bearings have had
86 turbo engines.  I will share what we are doing to protect my big buck engine.
We are installing a Milledge air/oil separator as the oil pump cavitates at high
(+6000) rpm.  An oil accumulator will be plumbed into the block at the entrance
to the #2 galley (probably overkill but we already have the part).  The master
has machined a crankshaft oil wiper to strip the oil off the crank.  He is
working on a design to add another baffle to keep the oil from climbing up the
side of the block on right hand turns.  He is plugging the oil return holes that
dump onto the crank. The rod journals will be chamfered on the trailing edge
with a half moon cutout to maximize oil flow to the bearings.   A probe with a
one way valve will run to the exhaust pipe to releave excess crankcase pressure.
Another consideration is to vent the #2 oil passage back into the pan to remove
any air.  No decision has been made on this.  We experimented with fuel cell
foam but it could not survive the oil temperature.  With luck what he is doing
should make the oil problem go away.

To address your question, here is what I would do in your situation.  Get ahold
of Jon Milledge, if you are lucky enough to catch him, tell him what you plan
and buy what he recommends if it is within your budget.  If you do drop your pan
(major pain) update your baffle with the 03 and change your rod bearings.  The
03 is not the answer but it is better than what you have.  If you want to go
this way, I have a 03 manufactured in '91 for $40.  I bought it from George B.,
found out it is the same as the one I have and haven't got around to sending it
back yet.  The most important thing to do is keep your oil level 1/8" above
full.  Check it after each run as these little devils drink a bit of oil at the
track.  You can survive with the R-1s but stay away from slicks.

BTW, the angle of the oil holes on the rod journals on my new S2 crank are
exactly the same as my old 951 crank.  The master says from a design standpoint,
they are in the correct position and he would not have them redrilled.
