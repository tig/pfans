Hey guys and girls,

Here's a few replies to emails I've seen over the last couple of days:

>I know that they started to come out with 83 degree
>thermostats, instead of the 80 degree, to allow
>the cars to run warmer. I guess they feel that is
>being more environmental aware.

That is correct.  Last time I had my car in for water pump replacement (when
they replaced the rebuilt junk one with a new unit), the new unit came with an
83C thermostat.  That really means nothing because your gauge is all over
the place and your wondering what's going on.  This is what my gauge was doing:

Action               Gauge
-------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
Start car            Bottom (obviously)
Idle for a while     3/4 mark (thermostat opens)
Radiator gets hot    Drops down to 1/4 mark once fans turn on (this is where
                        it previously used to run)
Radiator gets cold   Rises to 3/4 mark (themostat opens again)

I didn't like this so I took it in and Weissach Performance did a bunch of
pyrometer tests on vairous hoses, etc. and that's when they realized the
thermostat was opening at a higher temp than another 944 Turbo at the shop.
They decided it was a bad thermostat so they opened it up and found that it
was actually a higher temp thermostat.  We stuck in a normal usual thermostat
of 80C and all was fine again.  The cycle is now as follows:

Action               Gauge
-------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
Start car            Bottom (obviously)
Idle for a while     1/2 mark (thermostat opens)
Radiator gets hot    Drops down to 1/4 mark once fans turn on
Radiator gets cold   Raises to 1/2 mark (themostat opens again)

When driving, both thermostats would drop down to the 1/4 mark.

One thing I did notice is that the high speed fan rarely comes on with this
thermostat, but then it is pretty cool out here right now.

This is actually quite acceptable when you look at the car's performance.
My previous car was ridiculous to maintain and this car gives me more 
pleasure.  I added up all my bills yesterday and I've spent C$6200 on
EVERYTHING since I bought the car in August.  If you take out the 17"
wheel upgrade, it would be only C$4200 and I got a lot done in that
money.  I did all the updates (oil cooler seals, and rad hoses), all the
belts, water pump, accessory belts, starter [:)], seat heater switch,
all engine seals replaced, etc, etc.  I'm not expecting this to be 
an every year type of thing.  I think next year's expenses will be lower,
unless a clutch blows up or something, but even that, is a long term fix.

This sounds like a belt slipping.  When my water pump failed, it started
to leak.  When my water pump in my Talon self destructed, it sounded like
square marbles being tossed around a bowl.  I would look at your voltmeter
on the dash when the squeeling happens.  If it drops and comes back up when
the squeeling goes away, then you know it's the alternator belt.  I had this
and everytime I'd turn on the rear defroster, my car would do it's opera
imitation.  Got it tensioned and all is fine now.

I've tried everything to keep that reservoir dry, but there is a little 
vent hole on the top cap that I think is what makes everything a bit damp.
Also, it seems PS fluid attracts dust pretty good which brings more
attention to it.  Another thing while we're on this topic, my PS pump
was groaning a bit when turning it almost full lock.  I added some
Redline synthetic ATF and the groaning went away.  I'm talking like 1/8th
of a glass.

On other news, the metal master brake pads are working now.  Stupid me
didn't break them in properly (hey, no one gave me any instructions!).
Now, they actually dust up the front wheels before the rears :) and I can
actually stop.  I'll still try out the Hawks when they come, but for now,
I think the brakes are OK.  Thanks to all those that assisted me in correct
brake metal master break in procedures.

I also ordered a front lip splitter.  It's for purely costmetic use.  Cost
was C$250+14% tax.  I'll install it, take pics, post them on the web and
you guys can then decide if you wanna get one.  It looks to be made by AIR.

And, finally, I got my race wheels!  Yah!  They are 16" 993 wheels, taken
off a new 993 that traded them in for the 17" veersions.  They are 7"
up front and 9" in the rear.  I wanted 8's up front, but that can wait till
later.  I'm getting the Hoosiers mounted tommorow for this weekend's event
in Kent, WA.  Hopefully, we can get some dry runs in to break the new fronts
in and some wet runs to get more experience in the rain.  (I got the thing
45 degrees sideways yesterday and it wasn't too easy getting it back in line).

Paul is picking up a set of 17" 993 wheels for his newly acquired car and
is going with S-02 Bridgestones.  I'm jealous :(
