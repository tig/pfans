The tab (screw) at the top of your strut controls the rebound of your shock.
To adjust the shock to full soft, turn the tab clockwise until you feel a
"stop".  It may already be on full soft so don't force it.  To increase of
stiffen the rebound, turn the tab counter clockwise (anticlockwise eh?).
There are no preset detents, but rather you will probably have two full
rotations of the tab.  You can set the rebound at any position within that
range.  Remember to match the adjustments on each front unit.  Koni
originally supplied a knob that fits on this tab (we have them if you need
one) but you can use pliers etc.  Rebound is the action of the piston rod
extending out of the shock housing.  The stiffer the rebound, the slower the
piston will extend out of the shock. Units are now availble that allow you
to adjust the compression of the shock but that's another story.

You can adjust the rear ride height of your car by a concentric bolt in the
spring plate.  There are two bolts/nuts on the spring plate.  One kind of
holds the two pieces together and the other is concentric (like a cam).
Rotating the cam bolt will allow you to lower the car.  More than likely
this adjustment will lower the car enough and you won't have to mess with
the torsion bars(a pain!).

Your rear shocks are adjustable.  Remove them from the car.  Remove the bump
rubber that is in the upper dust cover.  A pair of needle nose pliers works
good.  Fully compress the shock, this will engage an internal adjustment
mechanism. Counter clockwise is full soft (once again you'll feel a stop)
and clockwise is firm.
