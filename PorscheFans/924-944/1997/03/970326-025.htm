Hi Barry , 

I was reading your post on this string and here I stand on the soap box :))

I agree a 100% on that, my 924S is a great on handling but it hais it's 
limitations, but I would not change it for another car or do some serious mods
mainly because most of all try to keep their cars the closest to original 
condition as possible.

I agree... some people buy Porsches to flash and mostof the time don't know 
how to drive them....

Mouhahahah, never underestimate a Cooper S.... very fast little cars ;))
We should put in this level as well little TVR's or even some Peugeots 206s16
evolution II.
