Anodized wheels have a clear anodic oxide coating produced by the process of 
electrolysis.  The anodizing is very hard and durable, but it is also porous and 
susceptible to staining by harsh cleaners that aren't pH-balanced.  When new, the wheels 
look like bare metal with a slight sheen.  After years of neglect though, the anodizing 
turns a dull, flat gray that is really ugly.  If caught early, the anodizing can be 
buffed back to the origianl look, but my front wheels are past the point of no return.  

Phone dial wheels are factory finished with silver piant and a clear-coat.  Time also 
takes it's toll on these wheels, usually with the clear-coat cracking, turning yellow, 
or a combination of both.  If a polishing wax doesn't help (I've seen this discussed on 
the list before, but can't remember when), then the old paint must be stripped and 
either repainted or polished.  I've seen these cast wheels polished before, but it 
doesn't seem to be as popular as it is with the forged wheels.  Some people repaint the 
wheels themselves with Wurth paint from a spray can.  Wurth is a high-quality German 
paint and a perfect match to the factory silver (I just happen to have some, if you're 
interested).  As for the center caps, I think yours are also painted, but can be 
stripped and polished along with the wheels.

I'll probably use a cloth buffing wheel with polishing compound, but just shy of the 
chrome look would be about right.

Yes.  From what I can tell, it's not really difficult, just time consuming and time 
equals money.  However, a professional shop has a good chance of getting a better result 
than us amateurs.

Will do!
