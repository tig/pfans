<< 
 This type of rotten attitude is what gives the standard 944 such a bad rap.
 Sell my 944 to buy a Turbo?  Not a chance.  I've seen a few 8 valve 944s
 that routinely eat Turbos for lunch at the track.  >>

Are we feeling a bit fractious this morning? I think you need to cash a
reality check quickly. George gave you some realistic advice that he has
gleaned from allot of experience. No one on this list will put you down for
owning a NA 944. They are certainly fine Porsches. The point is that by the
time you spend the kind of money you had intended you will have a unpleasant
car to drive that won't have a significant power increase. The Turbo gives
you that performance right out of the box. I don't know where you get the
idea that you will have 3 times the maintenance. The most unreliable 944 I
have ever owned was a 87 944S.
 As for the 944's eating up the Turbo's, yes that can happen in certain
situations and with talented drivers. In AutoX it happens all the time, in
track events......not likely.
Bottom line-- don't be so sensitive and enjoy your car. Also realize it's
limitations as far as power.  Leave it stock, and save your money for driving
events.
