Sorry to send another email on the same subject, but I wanted to comment on
this:

>I need to work on being smooth, I am still a straight line driver, I don't

>take a speed hit when I have to turn sharply (instead of rounding out the

There are basically two styles of driving, I call them the Bondurant style
and the Jackie Stewert style.  Bondurant teaches trail braking, Stewert
wants you to hit the brakes in a pretty much straight line and then 
accelerate out.  For a turbo car, the Stewert method works a lot better 
because you get on the throttle much earlier and can get on boost by the
exit.  I noticed that the the S2 guys use trail braking quite a bit, but
I can't get any power coming out of the corner if I use that method and I
prefer using straight line braking anyways.

I might be wrong in my quoting here so someone can correct me if I'm wrong,
but a magazine asked Jackie Stewert about driving the proper way and was
questioned about Bondurant's (maybe Jackie also runs a school???) methods,
Stewert replied, "How many world championships has he won, how many have
I won?"  Once again, I might be wrong with the exact words, but it was
something to that effect.

Another thing I've noticed in these cars, they have awesome ABS systems,
use it.  It works great to settle the car when you're all twisted out of
shape and think you are gonna lose control, it can usually save you,
but if it's gone too far, there's no hope.

I got my lip spoiler and it looks really wild.  I've decided to let Paul
try it out on his car first before I get it installed on my car.  My car
sits a bit lower than his and I'm afraid I'm going to break it in a week,
so we'll see how it looks on his car.  The quality is really good and the
fitment looks like it'll be perfect.  I'll put pics up on the web when it's
painted and installed.

Darren ran an auto-x yesterday in his 87 951 and taking my advice, got a
very good time, but a spin, right through the timing light gate.  He
actually went through the timing beam, got a good time registered and then
turned the car around such that he was parked perpendicular to the timing
lights.  He's getting pretty quick!
