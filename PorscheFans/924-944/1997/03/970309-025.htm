	Carl, I live in Irving (Dallas County rather than Tarrant; more
	expensive for those of you not familair with the area) and
	I have full liability, comp. and collision on my 87 944 with
	uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and a $500 deductable.
	Also, I have no restrictions whatsoever on driving the car. I pay
	$925 a year for all this. I think you should start looking for a
	new insurance company. Mine's Prudential, btw.
