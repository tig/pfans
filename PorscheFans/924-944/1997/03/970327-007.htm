I'm installing Automotion Stage II (ver. 2.7) chips in my '87 951.  A few of
you responded to my request for feedback regarding performance improvements -
it was unanimous - "Get the chips!"  So I got the chips, and some
recommendations to upgrade the head studs and head gasket as well.  Trying to
think this through, I've ended up with a conclusion that seems logical, but
I'd appreciate any differing opinions to see if I've left anything out of the
equation.

It seems to me that if I'm putting additional strain on the engine (including
pistons, rods, bearings, head gasket, etc. as well as the drivetrain) and if
something's gonna let go as a result of the added horsepower, isn't the most
preferable of all the options to blow a head gasket?  It would also seem that
the head gasket would hopefully be the weakest link, so to speak.  If this
logic runs true, why would I want to reinforce the weak link, and create a
new weak link which could be rods, bearings, tranny, half-shafts, etc.?

Please keep in mind, I'm not arguing a point here.  I'm pontificating.  No
flaming, please.  If your experience or knowledge is contrary to my thinking,
please enlighten me - and maybe save me a couple grand - or more.

TIA,
Jeff
'87 951 (31K, soon to be chipped and maybe new head gasket) 
'77 911S (89K, never to be chipped and no headgasket)
