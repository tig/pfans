From this list I have not had anyone knock the SP8000s.  Matt (from 
this list) has a friend that works for NTW and this Friday Matt is 
going to check with him about the defect %.  I do have a friend who 
recommended the SP8000s to me.  He bought 4 for his C4 and 3 were 
defective but he liked them enough to replace them.  I do not believe 
that this is normal but it is a hell of a coincidence.

As far as my problem, I have not determined the cause yet.  I paid a 
bit more attention today though and here is an update:

When the car is cold (ie. first driven) the shimmy starts in 2nd gear 
at about 37MPH and stays with me through all gears to about 65 but it 
is not terribly bad.  Once the car warms up (ie. Drive for about 15 
minutes) the shimmy lessens in intensity almost to the point where you 
cannot feel it.  At the top end, it shimmys starting around 100MPH and 
get worse to 120 where I stopped accelerating.  It sounds like I may 
have two problems one of which may be related to tire temperature and 
the other alignment or something.   Any suggestions????
