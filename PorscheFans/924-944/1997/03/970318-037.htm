Well, didn't make that too clear.  Halfway through the turn, I do the
opposite -- give it more gas.  I don't "bounce" on the accelerator (like,
jump from holding my speed to full throttle) under any circumstances.
(You weren't saying that, I don't think, but I wanted to make it totally
clear, since doing that probably would cause an accident.)

What you described pretty much sounds like what I'm trying to do.  I'm by
no means perfect, but I think I have most of it right.  I do all my
braking in a straight line whenever possible.

On a (sort of) unrelated note, can anyone tell me what a CV (constant
velocity?) joint is?  Or maybe a CV universal joint?  Well, I know what it
is.  I've seen it on my car, and I've seen Perf Products advertising one,
but I don't know what it does.  The Haynes manual just says "...and the CV
universal join attaches to the [blah blah blah] and this clearly gives
better handling, as anyone with half a brain can see."  (Not that I'm
bitter.)
