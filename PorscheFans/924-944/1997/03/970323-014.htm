First of all, an organic cleaner isn't going to cut the adhesive used on
wheel weights.  Some sort of chemical solvent is the only way to remove it.
Try brake cleaner or carb cleaner.  If you can find a good "safety" solvent,
I'd recommend using that.  Just be sure to keep it away from the finish on
the outer portion of the wheel.  

As far as your question on tire shops destroying your wheels.  They CAN and
they WILL!  If you can find them, BUY EXTRA WHEELS!!!  My precious chrome
plated Carrera 2 wheels were destroyed by some teenaged kid who didn't know
how to use a tire machine properly.  The machine carved a gouge around the
entire outside edge of the rim.  I had to go back to the original phone dial
wheels on my 944 (killed its looks) until I could get the wheels repaired.
This cost me a bundle and they still don't look as good as they once did.  I
live on the Gulf Coast where I can run summer tread tires year around.  If
this happened to me during a routine tire replacement, it could very well
happen to you due to your frequent tire swaps. 

Good luck and enjoy your 968!
