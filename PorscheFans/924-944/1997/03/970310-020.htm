I was skeptical about this too, because each chip manufacturer will have
you believe theirs is the best.  I finally decided about two years ago to
take the plunge with the Weltmeister chips, made by Dinan (good reputation)
and sold through Automotion.  This was a fairly simple installation, no
mass air sensor or any of the other fancy stuff.  My mechanic had actually
done some developmental work for Weltmeister, and so stood by the
installation 100%.  For the next couple of weeks, the mechanic would
"tweak" the installation free of charge.  The result is that the car has
suffered nothing in drivability, and has all the benefits of the additional
power, which is considerable.  Granted, this is a street car and not driven
at track or autocross events.  If one were to do so, I would definitely
advise replacing the cylinder head bolts.

We dynoed the car on the mechanic's chassis dyno.  I saw the reading come
back as 251 hp @ 5,000 rpm to the rear wheels, which makes the
manufacturers claim of 263 hp at the flywheel seem plausible.  This is on
the tame side when one sees 300 hp 944 turbos out there, but it makes the
already fanstic 944 turbo into a simply awesome performer for very little
money.
