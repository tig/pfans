	Joe, the Porsche 944 is not a Volkswagen, it is a racing car.
	So your experience with the VW's won't be much help for 
	comparison purposes there. Bear in mind that you are
	considering purchasing a race car; race cars can be *expensive*
	to maintain. You're right about the older 944's; many of them
	suffer from neglect because the the prices have dropped so low for
	them that teenagers could buy them practically. Unfortunatly, they
	could not afford to maintain them so lots of important things like
	coolant/brake/trans fluid flushing, water pump replacement, belt
	replacement, etc. have been ignored. It would be very, very bad
	for you to buy a car that has been neglected in this way. The fact
	that you can afford a 944 but not are not able to absorb much
	in the way of maintenance costs should scare you a bit. Let me
	throw some numbers at you: water pump job $1000, power steering
	rack $1000, clutch $1300, shocks $1300, timing belt with all
	rollers $450, oil cooler seals $600, etc. See where this is
	heading? be sure you can absorb some, if not all of these costs
	just in case. This is what I would do if I were you (looking
	for an 83 944, that is): I'd try to find a PCA member who was 
	selling one, then I'd find a shop recommended by the local PCA
	chapter and pay them a couple hundred bucks to look the car over
	and check *everything*. This car is 14 years old; there may be
	alot wrong with it. You may even get a second opinion from another
	shop. All that said, the 944 is an awesome car when properly
	maintained and use. If you find a good one, I can assure you that
	you'll be happy with it. Good luck!
