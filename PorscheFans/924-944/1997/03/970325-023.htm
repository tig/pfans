Thanks to Jason Burkett for the Koni Phone Number, I will call Koni for
the adjustment tool after work!

Thanks to Marv for the excellent lead on $150 A-Arm rebuilds!!

Ok, now more about my '85.5 NA 944's progression into parts on the shelf

I removed more of the front end last night (40 Deg's in my garage,BRRR) 
I Finally gained access to the Cam and Balance shaft belts.  The PO of
this car definetely did not know what they were doing, or they had an
incompetant mechanic.  The Balance shaft belt was pratically flaping
around!  It was soo loose I am surprized it didn't fall off!  I thought
the engine vibration was a bit much, but just passed it off as a 2.5L 4
Cyl engine...  Now I know better, should have looked into the vibration
problem much sooner.  Ok, so here is the question.  Oil is leaking from
the balance shaft seal, so obviously I should replace it.  While I am at
it, I should probably replace the other seals that I now have access
to.  I will evaluate the rollers, and will definetely replace the
belts.  Are there any additional suspect components that would go bad
with an improperly aligned balance shaft?  Sure hope the bearings are
ok.. 


Other questions:

o Air Conditioning System is de-pressurized, how do I find the leak(s)? 
Can I use compressed air to pressurize, and listen/spray water on
components to find a leak?

o Power steering pump has play along the shaft axis, ie. I can push the
shaft in and out of the pump slightly.  Otherwise, it seems fine.  The
power steering reservoir has the usual leaks, I will replace the hose
clamps. Is the aforementioned play ok?

o Thick black sticky (oil?) substance on air intake manifold, is this
ok?  It is in  pattern that looks somewhat like how the air might enter
the intake manifold.  ie. it doesn't coat every surface.

o What should I use to touch up areas of the undercoating that have been
removed? (PO and incompetant mechanics did not protect areas which were
contacted by lifts, jacks, jack stands, etc..) Can I use 3M rubberized
spray on undercoating?


Other observations/things that were found to be broken....

o exhaust hanger to rear of Cat. broken, that explains why the exhaust
was chattering against the vehicle durring acceleration on the highway.

o Washer behind Distributor Cap is very worn.  Some axial play of
Distributor Cap.  

o Power steering pump only had one of two pivot bolts
o Power steering pump turnbuckle nuts trashed, belt loose and cracked
o Small leak from radiator, further investigation needed


I would suggest to anyone who is about to purchase, or anyone that
already owns a 944, to thoroughly inspect the vehicle for problems, if
they have not done so already.  Obviously this involves some amount of
dissassembly, but it is worth it.  I unfortunately did not know much
about 944's when I purchased mine.  I paid $5,000.  I probably should
have paid $3,500->$4,000 given the amount of work that needs to be done.
Unfortunately, the seller probably would not have gone lower even with
info on needed repairs. Despite this, I am happy with the vehicle, and
am learning a lot from the repairs, and from this Group.

Thanks again!

Ezra (ehall@btv.ibm.com)

'85.5 Guards Red 944, 230Kmiles, used engine, slight synchro problems,
many parts in ziplock bags and on shelf, soon to be re-assembled, and
back on the road cruising through the winding Vermont roads, etc... so I
hope..
