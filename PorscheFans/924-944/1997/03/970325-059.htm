This type of rotten attitude is what gives the standard 944 such a bad rap.
Sell my 944 to buy a Turbo?  Not a chance.  I've seen a few 8 valve 944s
that routinely eat Turbos for lunch at the track.  Plus, why would I want to
triple my repair costs?  Misinformed opinions like telling someone that 5
extra bhp is all that you can squeeze out of the 944 with those mods is a
bit ridiculous.  Most exhaust mods alone are enough to get that kind of
benefit, and YES I DO know the difference in engine horsepower and brake
horsepower, so don't even go there.  My point is, why down someone because
of the particular Porsche they drive?  In this case, it's Turbo vs.
Non-turbo.  Is that any more ridiculous than saying that a 944 Turbo S is
not a REAL Porsche because it's not air cooled?  Or, maybe that a 914 is
just a hopped up VW.  Tell that to the guy who just blew your doors of at
that last autocross race in one.  I had a guy in a brand new 911 Twin Turbo
pull along side my 944 in a Houston, TX parking lot and compliment my 944
because he liked the way my wheels looked.  I was somewhat in awe while
drooling over his new prize, but he exhibited no snobbish behavior at all.
This is the attitude that we should all strive to maintain.  The guy was
just a genuine Porsche fanatic.  I am a former Corvette owner and club
member.  After being used to the brotherly behavior of Corvette owners,
(i.e. waving at other 'Vettes on the road, friendly conversations at gas
stations, etc.) I was kind of taken by surprise at how snobbish a lot of
Porsche owners tend to be.  I'm not saying all of them are, but a lot of
them.  I have had more than one Porsche owner refuse to even speak to me
after my complimenting his car.  That's not just snobbish, it's damned rude!
It's easy to see why a lot of non-Porsche driving motorists view us as a
nuisance.  How can we possibly change this attitude if we can't even get
along with ourselves?  Who cares if it's a spotless 356 Speedster, a rusted
out 924, or a shiny new Twin Turbo?  It's still a Porsche.  I can't think of
anything more immature than two grown men bickering over whose car is
better.  I realize that there are a lot of you who do not have this attitude
and dedicate countless hours of your time promoting safety awareness, and
enjoyment of the marque.  This letter is not intended to insult you.  My
hat's off to you guys.  Just some food for though from a concerned
enthusiast.  I'll get off my soapbox now!

Thank you,
C. Patterson
