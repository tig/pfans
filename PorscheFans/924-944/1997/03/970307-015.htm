Surya,

I live in Seattle and prior to purchasing my car, I spoke to a lot of
the people in the PNWR of the PCA.  Everyone recommended the same shop
for working on 944's : Chris's German Automotive  462-9296.  They are
also in Bellevue and I have been extremely impressed with them (I can't
say the same about the dealer, or one of the other Porsche "specialists"
in Seattle).  You might want to give Chris a call.  They are very good,
very honest and really know their stuff.

Usual disclaimer: I have no affiliation with Chris, or his shop.  I am
just a very satisfied customer.
