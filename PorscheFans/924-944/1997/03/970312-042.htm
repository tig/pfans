> Hey Darren, how do I get in on this? Cost?
	It's pretty expensive. 300bux for the day with another 150$ for a 
room. I'm going since I get a free room with my uncle. This is the 
novice one... the more experienced one is on June 30th which is 350$. 

> Was this the parts guy or service rep? Sounds like they don't know
> anything.
	It was a dealer and a service rep. Service rep said he raced a whole 
bunch of cars and basically said to my face that I probably couldn't 
drive the car to its ability... which is true. But the part about 
putting in as little oil as possible really got me. 

> Pretty much stock means?
	Means I got a chip and that's it (that I know of... I'm the 3rd 
owner and Weissach has the records). Suspension is stock with the 
black struts meaning I got oem Boge shocks... I think. Anyhow, they 
ain't Koni Yellows. And it hasn't been lowered. Heard somewhere that 
usually lowered track cars have the problem with the control arm so 
I'm not too worried about that. As for checking them. MCL does a 
local check-up the week before you go down. If you want more info 
just drop by MCL and ask them... they'll give you their application 
form.
