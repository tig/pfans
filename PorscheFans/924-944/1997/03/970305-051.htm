The squeak may be coming from your AC or PS belts.  I have a new pump, and
they squeak for a few seconds when cold sometimes.  When my pump started
to fail, the bearing started making rattling sounds, but it wasn't
leaking.  I verified the sound was coming from the water pump by holding a
length of garden hose to my ear, then probed in the vicinity of the pump,
using it as a stethoscope.  When I examined the old pump, the bearing was
so shot the impeller was rubbing on the housing. Rotating the pulley, it
felt as if the thing were made of stone or something.  If you see coolant
leakage from behind the belt cover change it right away. 

How many miles since the last change?

I recommend to all to change the belts, rollers and all seals if you are
changing your water pump.. doesn't cost much more, and brings much peace
of mind.. since the labor has already been done to get that far in.
