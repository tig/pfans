Hi Chad (and everyone else gathering around the flames),

Hey, I answered the original post in about the same way, essentially
telling what turned out to be a rather young kid that he might not get
all the horsepower the advertising promised with all those aftermarket
add-ons.  

I think George's post was on the mark, at least in the sense that there
is no free bolt-on lunch in the NA 944 world.   The car is wonderfully
balanced right out of the box, and any relatively inexpensive yet
substantial improvements to the car come easier in the suspension
and the driver's seat.   

This kid was looking for horsepower, and asked our opinions about
some stuff that did not get the integrated development that the rest of
the car did.   Spend all that money, and hang all that stuff on the car and
who knows what you end up with?   Acme promises 4.3% for this, 
Bumstead claims 7 hp for that, Dogdrool thinks his whatzit can gitcha
another five.   Pretty soon you think you're buying a real tire burner,
so you spend the bucks and keep getting shut down by 4 cylinder 
Mustangs (please, for ridiculous example only) and wonder what 
gives.   

Ya wanna play with the big boys, buy the big iron.   You want to enjoy
the sweetest package Porsche ever put on the road, leave it alone
and enjoy what it gives you.   Shoot, I drive a noisy  928 and yet I still
think this of 944s.   But if a 944 guy wants to keep up with me, I don't
tell him to spend his money at a high class JC Whitney.

 . . . . now I'll step out of the way . . . .

Dave
