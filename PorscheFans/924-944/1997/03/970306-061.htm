I am traveling about 400 miles on Monday to look at a 1983 Porsche 944.  The
owner claims it is in "first class" condition, and has had the motor mounts
and timing belts replaced.  He reports no problems with shaking or leaks and
states there is no rust anywhere on the vehicle that he could find.
After doing about as much research as possible in two days, My question is
simple:
Are these cars reliable enough to drive daily without a great deal of worry?
I have owned 16v VW's in the past (GTI and Scirocco) and never experienced
any problems with them.  I wonder if the majority of the problems experienced
by the 944 owners are due to misuse and lack of maintenance, or are they the
"lemon" that one web-site proclaims them to be?
Please help.  I have always wanted a Porsche, but I cannot afford to pay for
it to be constantly repaired.
Thank you.
