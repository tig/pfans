No, that information is from a German Porsche mechanic who I used when I
lived in California.

The fact that an engine is high compression doesn't mean that the valves
have to share the same area as the cylinder.  Whether the valves intrude
into the cylinder area has to do with how far the valves open (which is, in
turn, based on the cam profile and rocker arm length), the actual angle the
valves are offset from vertical (more towards the 45 degree means it
requires less valve movement before the edge of the valve hits something),
and the physical size and shape of the combustion chamber.

The compression ratio is really that: a ratio.  If you know your bore and
stroke, you can calculate a volume.  If you add the combustion chamber's
size to this, you get total volume for the cylinder.  If you then divide by
that same combustion cylider size, you get a ratio, like 10:1, 11:1, etc.
In short, the compression ratio doesn't really tell you what's mechanically
going on inside the engine.  If you have a long enough stroke with a given
cylinder bore and combustion chamber, you can get diesel-like ratios!

I hope some of this makes sense.  I'll try to see if I can come up with
more convincing evidence later today or sometime...  Let me know if this
answers any of your questions.
