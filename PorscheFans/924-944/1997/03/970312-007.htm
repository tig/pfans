I have an 87 944 na with Koni reds all around.  With the front shocks set
to about 1/2 turn off full hard and the rear shocks set to almost full hard
the inside rear wheel would lift in a hard turn and I would smoke the tire
under acceleration.  Things improved when the rear was set to full soft
although improvements are still needed.  Hopefully I have solved the
problem with the addition of limited slip.  I'll find out this weekend.
