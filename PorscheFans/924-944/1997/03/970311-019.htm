     Hey Glenn,
        Check the rear tires.  I had a really bad rumble from the back 
     which had me convinced that I needed new rear wheel bearings.  I had 
     goodyear TA tires all round.  I acquired a set of 16" rims with 
     Pirelli 7000 tires and the problem had completely gone.
     
     Cheers,  Jan

I just bought an '84 944 with 47,000 original kilometers (29,257 miles). 
The car has been used as a sunday driver during the Canadian summer 
months.  Accordingly, it has been sitting for long periods during the 
winter months for the past 13 years.  
     
I noticed over the weekend a rear end "hum" that begins around 70 
kilometers per hour (about 45 mph).  The said "hum" is quite loud.  Is this 
normal road noise for a '84 944?  If not, does anybody have any idea
what could be causing the noise?  Any input would be appreciated. 
Thanks. 
     
Glenn
