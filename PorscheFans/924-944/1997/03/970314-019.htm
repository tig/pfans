	You know, when I read that lemon Porsche site (I think he
	must be referring to Caleb's Porsche site) the thing I 
	noticed about the stories was that they all had a few things
	in common:

	1. "I always took my car to the dealer for maintenance."
	This is almost *always* a bad thing to do. I know it 
	doesn't make sense but it's true. You need to find a good
	independent shop recommended by a ton of PCA'ers preferably
	to take your car to.

	2. "I put 40,000 miles on my car without ever having to take
	it to the dealership then one day it just quit!!"
	This one is self-explanatory to the regulars on this list.
	For the non-regulars, DO NOT IGNORE THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED
	MAINTENANCE ON THE 944 OR ANY PORSCHE. YOU WILL BE VERY
	SORRY IF YOU DO. I can't stress this enough...

	3. "When I bought my Porsche, I wanted to drive it like
	a bat out of hell 24 hours a day, so I did. After 50,000
	miles of this, it now runs like a piece of junk."
	Sorry, but if you drive the car like you're riding a roller
	coaster all the time, your maintenance is going to be
	that much more expensive. And if you're one to ignore
	maintenance, see number 2.	
 
	The rest of the stories kinda followed the same pattern.
	I felt sorry for the people because they just didn't know
	what they were getting into with a Porsche. Oh well...
