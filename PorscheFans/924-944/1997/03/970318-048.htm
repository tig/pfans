But then the air dam on your Porsche GT-1 will be ruined, and our pool of
perfect and original GT-1's on the market would be compromised!  Couldn't

right height to insure that he doesn't ever propagate, effectively removing
him from the gene pool without killing him and with no major sacrifice to
the car.
