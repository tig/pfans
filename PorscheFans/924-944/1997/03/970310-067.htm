My '84 944, with the sport package, came with Bilsteins. I confirmed this by 
calling PCNA -- the Bilsteins are on their records for my car's stock options.

A Bilstein shock has 2 valves rated for different pressures, within the chamber of 
each shock. The first valve closes on the down stroke in normal driving. When 
higher pressures are generated by the piston (such as hard cornering or braking) 
the 2nd valve closes and almost doubles the amount of pressure (shock) it can 
absorb. Konis are adjustable for rebound, _not_ for compression. Driving with Konis 
is like driving with Bilsteins with their 2nd valves permanently stuck closed, 
which is what you would want on a well-surfaced track at 130mph, but not 
necessarily on that pot-holed 30mph road to Kmart!
