Well, I'm not sure what the story is.  As I said, the CPU unit won't clear, and 
the original fault code read out by the dealer service tech indicated a bad 
sensor.  The individual sensor test (I think a simple resistance check) came 
out negative (i.e., no fault).

I've heard from a bunch of people about similar "stuck"  or faulty CPUs.  I 
heard from one guy that suggested that I check the connections again at the 
steering wheel, which I did last night.  There is a special "csssette" which I 
wasn't willing to take apart, even with the battery disconnected.  You refer to 
this below as the "contact plate."

My plan now is to disconnect the CPU and hope the light goes out.  I will drive 
for a while with this disconnected.

Then, I will canvas the list readership to see how many people have this 
ideopathic (i.e., of unknown origin) airbag warning light/CPU situation.  I 
think if we "threaten" PCNA with a class action, we may be able to negotiate a 
better price on the CPU, which is now over a grand.   I hate to do this, but...

 I already contacted PCNA and got a nice letter from the Customer Committment 
people in Laurel, MD.  I then got a message from the local rep who said "we 
can't do anything special for you, but you should get this fixed."

Mike,


Are you doing any of the airbag work yourself?  Since my passenger side airbag
has been deployed, I'm looking at the airbag system myself.  I've located the
sensors, and have looked at the control unit.  I unplugged the control unit
from the main passenger harness, then proceeded to locate the connections for
the sensors.  After deeming that the connections were behind some stuff I
wasn't willing to remove at that time, I plugged the control unit back in (too
scared to risk blowing my driver side airbag accidently).  Do you know if
unplugging the control unit from the main wire harness will hurt or harm
anything?

Could you have a bad control unit?

After the airbags are deployed the manual says to replace both sensors, both
airbags, the control unit, and the contact plate on the steering wheel.  I'm
not sure what happens to the control unit when the airbags are deployed that
requires a new one.  I'm not even sure what happens to the sensors or the
contact plate...

Good luck.

Thanks!
