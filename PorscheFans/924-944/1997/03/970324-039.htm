>Hello all:
>
>Early 1985 944 80K; from idle the car will hesitate strongly upon launching
>in first gear under full throttle.  If you let up on the accelerator the car
>can be brought up to above 2500 rpm and then all seems normal.  In addition,
>the car will stall if one does not let up on the gas during launch.  No
>symptoms under high speed or RPM. This problem came on gradually but only
>when the car was cold; now it presents itself at all times.

>Today I cleaned the entire air intake system up to the throttle plate from

>
>There was an improvement, the car was less hesitant to hesitate and it would
>not stall under full throttle, but things are still not right.
>
>I have checked all the vacuum conections and fuel and ignition seem fine.
>Fuel pressure checks out and there is no high speed miss.

That fuel pressure checks out is a good sign, but it's no guarantee that
the computer is telling the injectors to fire the correct length of time.
Translation: you could have a bad sensor.  Check out the engine temperature
sensor, the air-flow meter sensor, and the throttle-position sensor.  There
are books out there which show the acceptable ranges of values that these
sensors generate and mostly you can test them with an ohmmeter.  I would
start with the throttle-position sensor since what you describes sounds
like the experience I had many years ago with a stuck float in a carburetor
and not enough gas was available for acceleration-- just idle and low
speeds with no missing or other signs.  In other words, fuel starvation.
If you hit WOT (wide-open throttle for the uninitiated) and it bogs, the
engine isn't getting all the fuel it needs, either because of fuel pressure
(regulator, pump, or other) or because the computer isn't telling it to (a
bad sensor).

>Does this sound like an air flow meter problem and is the meter able to be
>serviced; or is it likely to be related to ignition or fuel directly?  In
>addition, waht other sensors in the air intake system could cause this?

Check out those things and let us know how it goes.
