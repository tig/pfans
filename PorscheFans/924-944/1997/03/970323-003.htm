Thanks again to all who provided advice on removing front struts on my 1983
944. While neither Haynes nor the Porsche manual mention it, I found it
easiest to remove the front calipers prior to removing the strut lower
mounting bolts. They are a 19mm bolt head just like the strut bolts, and
with the help of some Liquid Wrench and a good "heave ho," they came right
off. I'm learning as I go, so this counts as a success!

One minor question: While I had the front wheels/tires off, I decided to
give them a good bath to clear out months of brake dust and winter grime.
When I did I noted the cookie cutter wheels on the car are not marked
"Porsche" (unlike almost everything else in the car) but are instead marked
"ATS". Is this an aftermarket wheel or did Porsche use ATS wheels for some
cars? I'm pretty sure this is the same wheels that were on the car when my
wife bought it in 1987....
