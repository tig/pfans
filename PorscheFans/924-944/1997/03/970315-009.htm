I posted something to that effect several months back, but I may not have
been the only one.  It doesn't seem to have been totally successful, since
the heater is still not 100% consistent-- sometimes I have to cycle the
valve from full cold to full hot a few times before it finally stays off.
Unless the electrical signal to the valve is bad (haven't been able to
verify that, and I'd be tremendously afraid if it is), it's got to be the
solenoid.
