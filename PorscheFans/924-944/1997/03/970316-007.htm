From Ron Dibb   86-944 Turbo

Yourpost  below discussed the resetting of the air bag warning light on the 944.  Volume 3 of 
the workshop manual has the process in section 68.  When the system is disturbed, the memory of 
the diagnosic module picks up error codes which must be erased. You disconnected the lead to the  
air bag when you removed it from the steering column. This put an open circuit code in the 
control module which must be cleared after the air bag is reconnected. The manual describes a 
simple process which applies ground to pin two of the lead going to the control module in a 
timed sequence. Ground is applied for 5 seconds and released for five seconds and applied again 
for 5 seconds. The manual shows how to make a simple adapter to plug into the circuit.  The 
adapter is also used to input codes which query trouble codes from the diagnosis unit in the 
control unit. 

You must turn off the ignition,  apply the ground turn, on the ignition, leave the ground on 5 
secs, release 5 secs, apply 5 secs.  The fault memory should then be erased.  I would recommend 
you have the manual, and make sure you know what you are doing or have and expert do this.  Air 
bags are dangerous and there are numerous safety instructions to be followed before you mess 
with the circuitry.  A dealer should be able to reset the memory with no problem unless there is 
a fault which remains after the bag is reconnected.. .

I have the same problem, and took it to the dealership.
$120 later, they recommended that we replace the airbag,
and if that doesn't work, then replace the control module.
Right.  I have heard that the workshop manuals give somewhat
brief instructions for how to solve this problem, so I have
ordered a set.  Hopefully, the answer is in there somewhere.
