Kevin/Porschefans:

Here is what is in my '87 951 street/track car:

Front:

Sway Bar: Factory 30 mm hollow sway bar, which I've heard was used in the SCCA 
Escort Series and Turbo Cup series cars in Canada and Europe.   This bar was 
the M030 option on the 968, and can be had from a number of aftermarket 
suppliers like Windward, or from your local dealer (be sure to ask for a 
discount).  I got mine from Linda Grigsby at Carlsen in Palo Alto.

Shocks: Double adjustable (i.e., bump and rebound) Koni's sport units.  I 
bought these at a swap meet for $20 each.  I then had them revalved by 
Truechoice in Hilliard, Ohio.  According to the part numbers and some research 
I have done, these were used in some sort of 951 racing application as a part 
of a full Koni set up.  You may be able to buy them from Andial.  I've heard 
that they are $500-600 apiece!

Springs/perches: I use a good brand "X" 2 1/2 inch racing spring (height of 10 
inches and rate of 325 lbs.) on a standard coil-over perch.

Rear:

Sway Bar: Weltmeister.

Coil-over Shocks: Single adjustable (rebound only) Koni sport shocks which were 
used on the M030 968.  These actually have a 944 part number.  They have welded-
on lower perches.  I bough these, the 968 M030 "helper" springs and upper 
perches from Linda as well.  I don't use the factory helper springs since they 
seem to raise the ride height.  I use some shorter Carrera 2 1/4 inch springs 
instead.

Torsion Bars: Standard Turbo S 25.5 mm torsion bars.


The car handles okay-- it doesn't push on the track or in autocross.  It is not 
too stiff for the street.

As for the terms "Turbo Cup" and "Cup Car," I think a variety of suspensions 
were used.  In some series and in some years, an all Koni set-up was apparently 
used.  In others, there was an especially stiff Bilstein deal, which used rear 
coilovers instead of torsion bars.  I believe the Escort series cars had this 
set-up.  The people at Windward may be able to shed some light on this.  Also, 
I've heard that Jon Milledge owns one of these rare cars.  Recall that he drove 
them masterfully as part of the Carlsen Team when they first came out.  I 
believe that it is this Bilstein set-up that is most commonly referred to as 
the "Cup Car" suspension.

Some of different series had cars which used a 19, 20 or perhaps 21 mm rear 
sway bar.  I've gone through some dealer micro fiche on the 944/968 sereies, 
and you can actually find some part numbers for factory rear bars with several 
adjustment holes in these larger sizes.  You can also get one of these larger 
factory bars from Andial or Windward.  I prefer the Weltmeister because it has 
a sliding adjustment and fits just fine in the factory location.

As for the Bilstein set-up, I've heard that cars converted to this are very, 
very stiff and difficult to drive on the street.  I've also talked to a few 
people who say that it caused the car to hop through certain types of corners.  
The people at Windard, The Racer's Group or Kelly-Moss Racing could probably 
tell you more.  

With respect to $, I've seen people adverstise "Cup Car" supensions for as 
little as $1,500 in Pano.  I'm not sure whether they meant the Koni set up or 
the Bilstein set up, and what kind of condition the shocks would be in.


I hope that this information is helpful.

Mike,
Thanks for the info.  The chief instructor for Trackmasters told me he took 8
seconds off his Watkins Glen lap time after replacing his stock 89 Turbo
suspension with
the "cup car" suspension.  Is that the setup you're referring to?  Where'd
you 
get it and, if you don't mind sharing, about how much did it set you back?
I just bought an 88 Turbo S, which I plan to use for street and track.  
Thanks,
Kevin B
