For all Those Interested,

For the past year I have replaced several hoses on my '86 951. It seems 
that
once a new hose is installed the water/pressure finds the weakest link. 
All of the hoses that I have replaced have been very deterioated in 
condition.
I have now ordered all the hoses that I have not yet replaced. I assume 
that
another will go soon, so now I will have it "in stock" for a quick fix. I 
even
have them in my car (with the proper coolant) for those extended trips.
There are (12) hoses for the 1986 turbo (13) for the 944 Turbo S/1989 
Turbo, and this does not include water tubes, clamps (almost 2 dozen) 
reservoir tank, radiator, turbo pump, water pump and several misc. parts! 
Wow, thats alot of plumbing! The 944 normals are much simplified due to 
the missing turbo pump. I have listed the hoses below for your reference, 
which can be used as a replacement checklist. Pay attention when 
ordering, several part numbers are similiar. Do not subsitute with non 
Porsche parts. Most of them are custom tapered and angled for the proper 
application. Clean hose flanges before installing to ensure a good clean 
fit.
