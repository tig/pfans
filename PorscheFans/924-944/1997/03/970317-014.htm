where
my car fits, it has a strocked 2.8 liter engine (oh, I own an '89 951), plus
increased boost.  From reading the SCCA Solo I and II rule book I gather
increased boost is not allowed.  I'll probably swap out my KLR chip
(currently
Auto-authority) and put the original back in.  I'm not sure what the
increased
stroke does to the classification, the book only mentions that there is a
limit
on the bore of the engine (unless I missed something). <<

You can probably run in ASP until you start winning. The car is really
too modified for ASP (no internal engine mods) and not even legal
in Prepared class (engine size and turbo) so it's really an E MOD
car by SCCA rules. But hopefully your club will have an OSP
(Open Street Prepared) class that you can run in, which allows
any mods but the car should be street legal and usually must
run on street tires.
