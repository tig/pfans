Hey, I resemble that remark!

I put one of those dohickies on my car and I like it.  You are absolutely
right that wide open there is NO difference.  However, I confess that I do
not drive that car wide open all the time.

The throttle cam changes the personality of the car and it is much more
"satisfying" to drive that way.

Of all the mods that you can make to your car, this is one of the cheapest
and safest mods around.  After all, it's all just for fun.


As for the ruckus about modifications to the standard 944, well George is
right about the cost versus the amount of horsepower gain.  Chris is also
right on a number of points, but I think Chris might have taken George's
statement out of context.

I also agree that the normally aspirated car gets dumped on at times.  It
is true it is not as fast as a Turbo, or a fighter jet, but who can tell
another what makes them happy.  Horsepower is mathematical, happiness is
subjective.

Now that I own all three types of water cooled cars (Boxster excluded) in
my garage, my "personal" preference is the Turbo.  However, that is just my
opinion.  Although I have a right to express it, I do NOT have the right to
expect everyone to take it seriously.

Enjoy your driving,

Marv
