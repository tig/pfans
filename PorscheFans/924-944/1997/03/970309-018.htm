Even at idle, the engine is turning over near 1,000 RPM and that crankshaft
is much heavier than your camshaft.  Inertia being what it is, your
camshaft will tend to stop before the crankshaft, especially if your car is
in gear and you're moving down the road.  The result is bent valves.
Unfortunately, it seems all the 944 engines (somebody correct me here if
I'm wrong) are classified as the "interference" type, so you're out of
luck.  And it seems to me that there will always be at least one valve
partially open at any given position on the revolution.  Apparently 928
engines (some of them) weren't interference engines and the 968 is supposed
to be non-interference as well.

In short, the chances of the valves not getting crushed when the belt snaps
is about as likely as you winning the lottery-- sure, it could possibly
happen, but the chances are next to zero.  Sorry to disappoint you!
