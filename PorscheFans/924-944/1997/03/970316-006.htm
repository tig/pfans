>Then disaster struck. I *cannot* get the strut lower attachment bolts off

>Is this 18mm bolt on the lower nuts?

Hi Pete,

You really need to spray/soak these fasteners with a penatrant first, 
repeat spraying so penatrant is able to dislove rust etc. Let sit over 
night for really stubborn hardware.
Try Wurth Rost Off or PB Blaser, they really are effective.

This is a 19mm head bolt, make sure that you have the proper leverage 
when trying to break that bolt loose.

It is a real good idea to replace ther bolts to, considering the age and 
apparent condition.
One of them is a eccentric bolt (part # 171.407.265) for alignment and 
the other is a M-12 *1.5 * 50mm (part # 133.513.471). You will also need 
the eccentric washer (part # 171.407.267)
The nuts are 9VM-12 *1.5) part # N.022.141.4. Do not reuse the nuts! This 
hardware can be ordered through any Porsche dealer.

When assembling use anti-seize on the threads.
NOTE: Make sure that you scribe the strut bottom side in relation to the 
spindle assembly, so that you can adjust it to the original position upon 
assembly, This adjustment is made with the eccentric bolt! The proper 
torque setting for these nuts is 74 ft lbs. 

Good Luck,
