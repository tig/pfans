Porschefans:

When I bought my 92 968 in December, I dismounted the D40M2s and mounted
Pirelli Winter 210 snow tires.  The tire shop removed the old stick-on
weights and stuck on new ones.  This left adhesive material on the wheels
from the previous weights, which I carefully scraped off with a plastic
scraper.  Some stickum still remained, but even with a good organic solvent I
couldn't fully remove it.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt and I have black
rectangles on the wheels which shouldn't be there.

Does any of you know how to remove this stuff?  I have the "cup" (5-spoke)
wheels, 16 x 7 front and 16 x 8 rear.

By the way, it costs me about $100 per year to have the tires switched in the
spring and fall.  Even if a second set of wheels cost me half of new ones
($1000 rather than $2000) I could do this for 10 years before it would end up
being more expensive.  However, is there a significant risk that a good tire
shop will damage my wheels at some point?  Has this happened to anyone?

Thanks in advance.
