Hi all,

I've nearly got every little thing working on my car now (even the bulbs
under the hood and in the ash tray).  Just one thing bugging me.  My
girlfriend and I took a trip to Greensboro, NC from Annapolis, MD last
weekend; about 1000 miles all told.  Everything worked great on the way
down.  Got great gas mioleage with the cruise control (about 30-31 mpg).
Then, on day two we started back and the cruise was dead.  My right foot
can occasionally feel the pedal tremble as if the system were struggling
to maintain speed.  In fact, it is struggling to do this 'cuz speed only
falls off very gently.  As soon as I encounter an incline, even a very
slight one, speed falls off rapidly.  With cruise set, if I use the
stalk to switch it off, or if I get on the clutch, I can feel the
accelerator pedal rise sharply- this, despit the fact the system isn't
doing its job.  I've peeked and poked where the harness enters the
brain.  No looseness.  I've looked for loose or disconnected vacuum
hoses under the hood.  None that I could find.  Am I right that the
relavent hoses are the smallest sort which are hard plastic and black in
color?  I see these connected to items at the fuel rail, air
flow/throttle device, and so on.  Sound like the right hoses?  Any ideas
for how it might work so well one day and so half-assed the next?
TIA.

P.S. I read the cruise thread earlier this year as it happened and have
gone back to reread it in the archives.  No help there cuz I don't yet
suspect my brain.
