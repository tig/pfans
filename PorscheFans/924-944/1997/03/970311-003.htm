My Haynes manual says it covers all 1989 models. But the brake section
only describes the 2 piston calipers.

Not for pad replacement, maybe for a rebuild.

Correctamundo. A neat racing setup, lets you change pads much faster than
with pins. Brembo calipers you know.

BTDT, no special tool required. Open the bleed valves makes retraction
easier. If you're scrapping the existing pads like I did I just used a
large screwdriver wedged between the pad and the outside edge of the
rotor. Be gentle and put a rag on the rotor so you don't mar it. Some have
used C-clamps on the calipers but say it mars/scratches the nice black
painted finish. There is a special spreader tool if you wanna spend $.

I used vise-grips on the clip to compress it enough to remove. Pull the
pad wear sensor off. Rest is normal procedure in Haynes manual. Overall
real easy, even for a non-mechanical person like me.

I saw an advertisement in "auto motor und sport" (german car magazine) th=

Somebody sells a red 924 Carrera GT from 1981, 169000 km for 19000 DM.
(And this is NOT the first 924 Carrera GT i see for sale)

Yes. 924Ss were built from 1985-1988.

Hi Paul,

>My 1986 924S has very high oil consumption (1 liter every 300 km) and 
>I am still trying to find out whether it is caused by worn piston 
>rings or bad valve seals. The engine has done about 100.000 km (70k

Sounds like my car. (You know - i also drive a '85 924S). Mine also
has a very high oil consumption (4 litres oil / 1000 km). Replacing
the valve seals didn't change anything.
But in opposite to your car, my car ejects blue smoke if rpms are
going over ~5000 thus covering the back of it with tons of soot.

>I have done compression measurements and the results were 10.5 bar 

My cars compression also was ok - this was the main reason because
i had my valve seals changed. (I thought that this would indicate intact
piston rings.)

>The fuel consumption is very normal (10 l /100km ) and top speed is 
>230 km/h on the clock.

My 924S uses about 11.5 l/100km.

If you are in the need of specs (next available over-sizes for
pistons, etc.), i can send you copies of them by snail mail or fax.
German specs. Of course. As usual. ;-)


Groetjes,
