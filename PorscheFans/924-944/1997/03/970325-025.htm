I thought I should relay to the list my experience of last weekend with the
sunroof.
This will hopefully save frustration to the sunroof users and may also contain
the
answer to the question above.

I had retracted the rear "catches" of the sunroof so that I could remove it and
popped
up the rear of the sunroof, but not removed it.  Then in my infinite wisdom
;-), I started 
the car and moved it a foot.  Notice that Porsche has installed this little
trick that figures out when
the "catches" are not engaged to the roof and the roof is still in.  It knows
when the roof
is in by the micro-switch that gets depressed by the tongue on the front of the
sunroof.  
Thus, the "catches" re-engaged the sunroof when I released the transmission
clutch.  Thus I
had to turn the car off again and tried to remove the sunroof again by first
lowering it (key
position 2) and then retracting the "catches" (key position 1).  During the
lowering of the
roof I heard some funny sounds, as the roof was now out of adjustment.  I had
managed to
crack the heck out of the plastic gears that motivate the "catches".  

It makes no sense that trying to engage the sunroof while it was raised in the
back 
would throw the system out of adjustment and trick it, but it seems like it
did.  The morale
of the story is "Do not leave the sunroof partially in if you are going to move
the car".

Paul, take the mechanisms that contain the rear sunroof "catches" apart and
check the
state of the gears.  The part number is 944.564.430.00 if you need to replace
them, they
cost about $3/each.

1987 944S (In need of two 944.564.430.00)
