I have an '89 951 which I bought from its third owner in August of 1995.  The 
car had ~16,000 miles when I bought it in the Rockford, IL. area.  It now has 
28,000 miles. In the time since I have owned it it has won several concours 
events in the Bay  Area.  I go to these events from time to time to keep some 
records on file indicating the condition of the car, in case some goof hits me 
and I have to hassle with the insurance company.  I wouldn't let it go for less 
than the $23,000 I paid for it (it is NOT for sale).  The car still has "new 
car smell" for crying out loud.

I know the current owners of the two cars mentioned by Ted Smith (E.H. Smith) 
including the one that used to be his.  My car is in a different category.  My 
point is this: if you are the person searching for one of these things, there 
is a big difference in price for cars which are nearly perfect (like mine) with 
less than 30k miles.  If you, or a friend get a "bargain" on one of these 
vehicles, good for you.  Every time I hear about a supposed bargain, the car 
has 30-50k miles.  This is really a different car than the one I own.

Not to say that Bruce Anderson (author of Excellence article) is all wet, but 
to point out that there are clear exceptions.  There weren't that many of these 
things made, and I wrecked one of them back in 1995 (my original '89 951, 
wrecked at Laguna with 32k miles).
