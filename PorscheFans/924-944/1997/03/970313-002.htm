Well, I've developed a small problem with my car.  Recently,
I was driving at night in the rain and fog and was using
the fog lights.  I was being courteous and turning off the
fog lights for oncoming traffic, but about the fifth or 
sixth time I turned them off, they would not come back on.
I discovered the next day that the horn also had stopped
working.  I replaced the stock bulbs (which were burnt
out when I purchased the car) with 100W lamps.  I figured
that a fuse was burned and I would have to go back to
55W bulbs, but I checked every fuse (all good).  Also, 
I can hear the relays clicking for both the horn and the
fog lights.  I've verified the bulbs are not currently
burned out, and that no power is making it to the bulbs.
Any ideas or am I going to have to trace the wires?

Thanks,
Clark
