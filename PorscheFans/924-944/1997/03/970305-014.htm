Last week I posted a note about my transmission needing help, and
requested advice on what to do.  ie. rebuild, used, etc..  This was for
my 85.5 944, normally aspirated.  Thanks to everyone who sent me a
response!  With the number of miles on the transmission, 230,000 ,
everyone agreed that a rebuild would quickly add up to a lot. I
therefore had decided on purchasing a used transmission, preferably with
a limited slip.  Before I made the plunge and ordered one, I decided to
get a second opinion on how bad it really is.  I brought the vehicle to
a porsche repair shop (not a porsche dealer), and asked them to take it
for a spin.  I went along on the ride.  The mechanic, actually the owner
of the shop, did not think it was all that bad (he mostly works on
911's, I don't know if this influenced his decision one way or
another).  My questions is:

How easily should a 944 shift when warm??  Compared to other vehicles I
have owned and driven, my 944 does not shift as easily.  Shifting into
Second is the worst, and the faster I shift, the harder it is to shift
into gear (I would expect this).  I can live with it, and can double
de-clutch fairly well now.  However, if this transmission is on its way
out, I would rather start enjoying a newer one now. 

How do other 944's shift???????????????????????

Thanks!!
