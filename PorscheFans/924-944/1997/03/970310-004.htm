I've had good results with the P21S wheel cleaner.  It appears to be the same 
stuff that Porsche sells as their wheel cleaner.  Just spray it on, wait a few 
minutes, then spray it off with the hose.  If the deposits are as bad as it 
sounds, you might want to invest in one of a soft "wheel detailer's brush".  I 
got one at Pep Boys, and it really helps around the balancing weights.  Of 
course, a toothbrush would probably work as well, it's just smaller.  I etched 
the clear coat on my phone dials with Simple Green, so avoid that.  The P21S 
bottle advises that for heavily soiled wheels, you can leave it on for a 
couple of hours before you hose it off (just don't let it dry), so if it's a 
cool, cloudy day or you can put the car in the garage, a combination of that 
and some gentle brushing might be the way to go.

I've been having pretty good luck using Sonax hard wax.  It's a spray, so it 
goes on pretty easily.  I usually apply this in the spring when I first get 
the car out, and then again mid-summer.  It seems to make the cleaning easier.

Cheers!
