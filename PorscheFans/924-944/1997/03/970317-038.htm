The only thing that I can suggest is that maybe when you reinstalled 
the steering wheel originally that you reversed the Airbag connector. 
 As I recall it is not keyed in any way so you could accidentally 
reverse it.  If you do take it apart yourself make sure you disconnect 
the battery and ground yourself to the chassis, one static discharge 
and you eat airbag.  You might also call your P dealer and ask if this 
is a possibility.

Subject:	Air Bag Reset

I too have had an airbag computer problem in my '87 951.  The airbag 
warning
light does not go out after the prescribed 5 seconds once the car is 
started.

The trouble began several months ago when I took off the steering 
wheel  (I
can't even remember why I took it off).  Anyway, I took the car to a 
Dealer.  I
watched the tech carefully as he followed the diagnostic procedure. 
 The blink
code indicated a bad crash sensor on the passenger side.  Funny thing 
was that
the individual sensor electrical check (with an ohmeter) did not 
indicate a bad
sensor.

Well, I got a new one anyway, which I had the dealer install.  When 
the tech
tried to reset the computer, the warning light stayed on.  The tech 
made a
photocopy of the manual section which covers the reset procedure.  One 
of the
steps is to leave the car battery disconnected for 20 minutes prior to 
attempting the reset.  I have tried the procedure at home a few times, 
to no
avail.  So far I've spent more than $200 on this problem.

I believe that the computer is "stuck" in some mode.  The tech said he 
has seen
this in similar systems (e.g., Mercedes).  The "only" solution is to 
replace
the fault computer.  A good used one can be had for $250-400, about 
half the
price of a new unit.

I'm probably going to disconnect the computer just to get rid of the 
annoying
warning light, until I decide what to do next.  I have a call into 
PCNA because
I don't think I should have to buy a new computer for a problem like 
this...
we'll see how far I get.

I am happy to send a FAX copy of the reset procedure to anyone who 
needs it.
