I love my adjustable Koni's too.  Can shocks really reduce wear on the
corner blocks of tire treads?  My understanding is that shocks reduce the
effects of a weight transfer or transistion, and not continuous load
situations like when cornering.  If shocks don't contribute to reduction of
body roll in itself, why might the tires wear better?  Better control of
weight transfer should facilitate faster and tighter turn-in when
maneuvering and thus create more wear on the corner blocks, right?  Anybody
out there know exactly how shocks might affect tire wear?
