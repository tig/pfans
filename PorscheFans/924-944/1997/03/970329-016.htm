Spent some time looking at Porsches today since it was a nice day.  My
sons and I stopped in at Grand Prix Motors in Seattle...

Don't know if anyone might be looking for a super low mileage 1989 Turbo,
but if they are, Grand Prix Motors has one.  It is Black/Black, with just
a bit over 12,000 miles, and appears to be totally stock with the
exception of polished factory wheels.  The car looked essentially like a
new car, including the undercarriage... and was priced accordingly at
$29,995.  I'm sure they would dicker quite a bit on the price since these
cars are usually sold on consignment, but they'd have to go much lower to
make it worth a serious look unless this was just the car someone had in
mind.  Anyway, food for thought.
