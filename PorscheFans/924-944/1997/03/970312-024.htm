	Surya, you're taking a big risk here. There's no real way
	to predict when those belts will go. They may never go; they
	could be gone by the time you read this rendering this mail
	useless advice. I am extremely particular about my car; if I
	found oil on any belts, I would replace them right away. That's
	just me. Hope this helps....
