The next time you have the wheel off, follow the plate attached to the control
arm forward. You'll see where this spring plate is attached to a torsional
spring or torsion bar. A popular upgrade is to supplement or replace the
torsion bar with coil over springs, more like the setup you expected to find.

He probably means he replaced the front springs and re-indexed the torsion bars
to get a lower ride height. But the rear of the car can be height-adjusted to
some degree by an eccentric bolt on the spring plate. So he could just mean
that he has lowered the rear of the car to make it level.
