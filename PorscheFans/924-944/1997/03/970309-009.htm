My 1986 924S has very high oil consumption (1 liter every 300 km) and 
I am still trying to find out whether it is caused by worn piston 
rings or bad valve seals. The engine has done about 100.000 km (70k 
miles) and runs and starts very well. There are no blue fumes (which 
I would expect with such high oil consumption) when I drive the car 
however there is a lot of black soot (I don't know whether this is 
the right word) coming from the exhaust.

I have done compression measurements and the results were 10.5 bar 
(150 psi) for all cylinders (with very small variation). If I squirt some oil in 
the cylinder the compression rises to about 170 psi. It takes 4 
compression strokes to reach the end compression. The compression 
ratio is 9.7 for this engine (1987 and 1988 924S have 10.6 
compression ratio)

The Haynes manual specifies that the compression pressure must be 
greater than 10 bar, is this for 10.6 compression ratio engines or 
for 9.5 (early US) engines?

The fuel consumption is very normal (10 l /100km ) and top speed is 
230 km/h on the clock.

I am still hoping that someone is going to tell me that it's the 
valve seals but I am (very) afraid that it is caused by worn piston 
rings. If this is indeed the case I think I will tackle the job 
myself but what is the likelyhood that the cylinder walls are also 
out of spec? 

Thanks in advance.
