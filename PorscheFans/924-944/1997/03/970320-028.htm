Hi all,

First just wanted to thank everyone who responded with my first ever
message to this list about a waterpump problem on my 85.5 944 - the shop
had put the balance shaft in "upside down" - all is now well and she's
purring like a kitten.

Now although I love this car, I wonder what can be done to give it just
a little more oomph!  I don't expect it to outrun my Maser Biturbo, but
a few extra HP wouldn't hurt.  The car already has  a chip, and the
suspension has been totally upgraded to the turbo suspension (all
original and new parts!)  The former owner was a Ferrari mechanic that
wanted to, but never took it to the track.

Here's what I'm considering:

1. K&N air filter
2. Exhaust changes?? - is it worth it?
3. High performance ignition - doesn't seem too expensive, but don't
know if it'll do anything
4. Any other suggestions?  I realize that if I really wanted power I'd
could have bought the turbo

Also, has anyone had experiences with oil additives - I just want this
car to have the best care possible.
