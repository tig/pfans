Hi everybody, help!

I had my 2k mile belt retensioning done last Wednesday at the local
dealer. When I picked up the car, I immediately felt that the engine
was tighter and more responsive. So, I drove it home a little harder
than usual, lots of fun, no problems. About a half hour later my SO
and I were about to go to dinner and when I started the car the idle
was *real* bad. So I shut 'er down. The first thing I thought was
that the balance shaft belt had slipped a tooth. I figured I may as
well start it up again, If I broke a belt or something, the dealer
would pay. When I did I was suprised that everything was almost back
to normal. I drove real gingerly to the restaurant where I really
enjoyed (sarcasm) my meal. The whole time the girlfriend saying "it
wasn't that bad." Yes it was! Since then, no more problems... until
last night.

Last night was a similar scenario. Come home from work, wait a half-
hour for her to get home, go to dinner. This time the idle was even
worse. I got courageous and revved it a little, and it was awful.
It sounded like a plug was out or something. Shut down and restart
and it got better. When I checked my fluids, however, I had lost a
considerable amount of coolant. I hadn't checked since the weekend
before the dealer, so I can't pinpoint when it happened exactly.
Nevertheless, it went from normal to a good 3/4" below minimum in
a week and a half. That 'aint good. I'm assuming it's my oil cooler
for now. I'm using Mobil 1 and I'm not sure what coolant looks like
mixed with that. Anybody? It looks O.K. to me. The car never
overheated, at least the gauge never said so. I've been 3k miles on
this oil and was going to change it soon anyway. I put about a half
quart of fresh oil in the crankcase to dilute any water that might
be in there and I'm at max on the dipstick. I guess I'll let my
mechanic look at this oil, maybe he can figure out what the deal is.
Has anyone seen this or can anyone theorize what it may be? Does
this have to be temp. related? I can't stand the though of my
pistons and cylinders trying to weld together. Any help would be,
well, helpful.

Thanks,
