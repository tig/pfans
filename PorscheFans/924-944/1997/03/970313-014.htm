*****

Manufacterers will measure an engine's bhp at the flywheel, on a
dynamometer, under ideal conditions.  Remember, with brake horsepower (bhp)
there is no motion or momentum which can effect the engine's capability to
either produce more, or less, horsepower.  There are too many variables,
road condition, tire condition, etc., which affect rear wheel horsepower
figures.  If the NA 2.5 944 is rated at 143 bhp or thereabouts, then that's
from the flywheel.

Raw horsepower, though, is not important.  It's torque and power-to-weight
ratio.  Sure, a Rolls-Royce V-8 puts out 300+ hp, but because it weighs two
tons, it can't out-accelerate, say, an 90 hp VW Gti (okay, bad example, but
you get the picture).

'86 951 w 263 hp (from the flywheel, I hope)
