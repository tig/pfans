If you have oil on your belts, change them right away!  Oil acts as a 
solvent to rubber and will quickly deteriorate it.  The 944 engine is 
an interference design.  The valves must move out of the way in proper 
time, or the pistons will hit and bend them.  This can happen if the cam 
belt jumps one tooth on the camshaft sproket, or fails altogether.  Not 
worth the super-expensive bill of a valve job or a new/rebuilt head.

A tiny amount of coolant present at the 'weep hole' at the bottom of the
water pump bearing is ok.  The shop could be paranoid about seeing any
coolant at all, which is understandable.  They don't want to replace your
belts and seals, then have the water pump seize a few thousand k down the
road.  Being driven off the camshaft belt, you can imagine the
consequences.  Check your records to see how much time/distance you have
on your present pump in making a judgement on replacement.  The person
changing the belts can give the pulley a spin while the belts are off and
pretty much tell you the story.  The rollers last a long time.. they will
warn of failure by making interesting noises.  Replace for peace of mind. 

Definitely do the front reseal kit when you change belts.. cam, crankshaft, 
balance shaft seals, everything!

Worry takes the pleasure out of owning a 944.  Your car will punish you if
you take a shortcut, sorry to say.  These aren't your average VW Golfs
where a belt or pump failure will just strand you, not cause thousands of
dollars in damage.
