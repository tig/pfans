Hi                                      1984 944

Please advise me of the nature  of this symtom

I backed the car out of the garage into the road  yesterday  65 deg f
and saw  the red light of no oil pressure as I reached for the key the
gauge as I watched shot up to 5 bar  where it usually   goes at idle for
a minute until the oil warms up.

Well  mildly adrenalined proceeded on my way to work 3 miles away, the
oil pressure gauge never went  below  4.5 bar even at a stop light were
I usally see it at 2.75-3 bar.

I hadnt driven the car in 4 days before this occasion.

I changed the  oil and filter upon getting home figuring something must
have either plugged the pressure sender  or the  oil filter had
bypassed  ??

To no avail   the  meter is still 4.5 - 5 bar even at idle
after a half mile  drive and then sit in  the garage  at idle for 5
minutes to warm .

I use 10-50 oil and change it and filter religiously.
the oil I took out was clean and translucent dark brown  

What  is going on  is the   sender  plugged  or   what.

If so whats the cost of a new one  and  is it a pain to put in.

Please  help   as I am worried and dont want to drive  this thing after
this event.


                    Thank-you  very much    / Ed
