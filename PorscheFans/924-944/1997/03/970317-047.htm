I am a 8 month owner of 83 944 that to my knowledge is stock. I am not
impressed with engine at this point. Have experienced engine surge at
part thottle and real lack of power until approx 85% throttle. Then hang
on it screams. This has been a real challenge this winter in Idaho on
snowy roads. Problem occurs mostly at low engine temperatures, less than
half of operating temp. I don't seem to get good gas mileage with it
eithor. About 17 mpg city or highway. Once it warms up it seems to run
satisfactory. I have replaced spark plugs, distributor cap, and rotor.
Wires are too expensive to buy but I have checked for arcing at night
and found none. Just what does the fuel computer monitor? I feel it is a
fuel problem and may be as simple as a temp sender. I am open to
suggestions at this point. Thanks   Buck
