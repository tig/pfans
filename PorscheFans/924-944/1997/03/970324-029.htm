With Oscar fever already on us this story seems mildly appropriate.

My '86 951 has the license plate CR MOVIE (see our movie).  The PO said the
car used to be owned by Tom Cruise (yeah, right), but it's my initials and
I thought it was cool at the time so I wanted to keep it.  Of course, this
plate and a guards red 944 turbo can sometimes spell nothing but disaster.
I've had people drive up alongside and say "what movie?" and follow me on
the freeway or come up to me at the gas station asking about everything
from managing my stock portfolio to giving them pointers on show biz.  Oh
man, talk about trying to keep a straight face.  Sometimes I just say,
"It's my boss's car," but other times I can't resist the urge to play along
and say "give me your card."

On the other hand, when I'm in LA-LA Land I get choice parking whenever
there's a valet around.  I doesn't matter if it's a shopping mall or a
restaurant.  Since I no longer drive the car very often, the plate doesn't
bother me anymore.   The general motoring public doesn't pay too much
attention to 944s any more it seems, but sometimes I think the value of the
plate is several times that of the car.
