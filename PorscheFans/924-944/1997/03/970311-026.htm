Regarding Automotion Adjustable Boost:

My question seemed innocent enough.

I don't think adjustable boost or boost which is higher than stock are 
automatic head gasket killers.  On my '89 951, I have the Autothority set-up 
which runs just under one bar.  On my '87 951, the Milledge race chips use 
waste gate shims as opposed to the jetted banjo bolt of the Autothority.  I 
think this car has a drilled cycling valve and a higher pressure fuel regulator 
as well.

Jon Milledge told me that because the four shims are agressive and the 1- to 
1.1 bar of boost is pretty "high," and that I should avoid heavy use of full 
boost without race gas, or at least a 50-50 mix on the track.  He also advised 
colder-than-stock plugs.

Recall that I bought this car in the Fall of 1995 from the original owner, an 
ex-Indy Car driver and friend of Jon's.  The mods were performed in the "early 
days" of 951 street development (circa 1988/1989) and included the Turbo S K-26 
turbocharger.  It had 61k miles at that time.  I think the original owner drove 
it VERY hard.

Still, it took me 1 1/2 years to blow the head gasket.  That's 30-40 AX runs 
and ~6 track events (times two drivers) in the California summer heat.  The 
failure mode seemed to be "simple" old age.

Anyway, I remember an article on Curt Erikson's 951 in Excellence which had the 
Authority MFS and an HKS adjustable valve (boost) controller.  I think he is 
now going whole hog, and having a race motor built with Motec.  His is the only 
951 I know of which tried an extensive adjustable boost set-up.

Milledge sells an adjustable boost mod which doesn't use the HKS system, but 
requires changes to the wastegate, I think.

This Automotion thing sounds somewhat "compromised" in that it seems too 
simple.  The boost control system in these cars is electronic, and I can't 
imagine that you can simply put in a vaccuum/boost line valve to control the 
boost.

At any rate, as these cars are so popular, the will probably sell a bunch of 
those gizmos to street drivers who would like to turn a knob...

>had a variable boost system in it. The car (black) had only 30,000 miles
on it but it had been blown up so I passed on it.<

As the gas pedal goes down, one's brain power shrinks geometrically.  The
cockpit adjustable boost kits are called "dial a death" for good reason.  One
false twist and you will be joining our head gasket club.  Of course, once you
have it apart only money and good sense will stop you from making a few minor
modifications.  That certainly worked for me.
