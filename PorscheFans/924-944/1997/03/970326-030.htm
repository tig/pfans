 I've seen a few 8 valve 944s

FWIW, the turbo motor also has 8 valves.  The NA 944 is without question
one of the best handling cars of all time and is an ideal candidate for
autocross use, in many ways much better than the turbo.  There is
absolutely nothing wrong with the NA 944--it still deserves a lot of
respect almost 15 years after it was first introduced, but it doesn't
always get it.  The 951, like the 944S2 and the 968, takes the 924/944
platform to an extremely high level as a road car and track car, and it is
really THE ideal candidate for tweaking because you get the most bang for
your buck to start out with, as George B. correctly says.  One test-drive
will convince you.  I think most 951 owners would agree.  The two cars, in
stock form, may look alike, but performance is night and day--they are not
even in the same class.

If a new subscriber to PorscheFans is considering a 944, you just need to
educate yourself as much as possible and decide what it is you want.  I
would not spend the money making a NA 944 go faster by adding chips, but I
certainly would upgrade the wheels & tires, suspension, brakes, and
possibly the exhaust, and just keep the car in as fine a shape as you
can--they are still highly desirable and are not "dogs" by any stretch of
the imagination.  In general terms, the turbo IS more expensive, in parts,
in maintenance, in insurance, etc.  My 951 is for street use only, I don't
autocross it, and there are other 944s out there that would soundly trounce
it at the track.  On an open highway though, I could never get the top-end
power from a NA 944 to equal the turbo without serious damage to my
wallet--that's not what the NA 944 is all about.   We see "turbos" on cars
everywhere, but a Porsche turbo, no matter what kind, is still considered
exotic, and rightly so when you consider Porsche's history with
turbocharged road cars and their performance potential.

(insert Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance" music)

Most of us chose Porsche because of its history, and because it's reliable
enough to use as a daily driver while being solid enough for track
use--that's the very essence of a sports car that Porsche personifies so
well, and that's why we (on this list) all love the marque.  I will welcome
any Porsche, any engine size, any model, into my enthusiast's list.
