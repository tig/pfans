My '89 is a daily driver, and I depend on it.  It is just as dependable 
as my ex Golf GTI <snif> and I never worry about it.  However, I do 
attend to all maintenance before it is due (fluid changes, timing belts, 
water pump, filters, etc.

If you abuse it or neglect it, it will cost you, as Porsche parts are 
much more expensive than the norm.

I've had my car for 16 months, and all I've done to it so far (major work)
is replace the water pump, timing and balance shaft belts (seals and
rollers too).  Otherwise the maintenance is just as routine as most any
other modern car. 

Check the FAQ for weak points such as power steering leaks, sunroof 
malfunctions, and in some cases, the clutch (8 hrs+ on labor plus parts 
if replacement is needed, more labor for turbo cars.  The cooling system 
can be fussy if neglected or improperly bled.

Buy a car that is obviously cared for, with records.  Be sure everything 
is working, so you don't take on someone else's problems.  Be sure to 
have a shop inspect the car before you take it.

Take that 'lemon' web site with a grain of salt.  You will hear from over 
1000 folks on this list about problems.. and they are never that severe.
