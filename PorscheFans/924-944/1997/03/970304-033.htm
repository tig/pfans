This Winter, I installed some "oil protection" components in my '87 951.  I 
plan to use the car on the track for 6-8 weekends, plus about 20 AXs (times two 
drivers).  It is fully upgraded to Turbo S specs, plus has a set of Milledge 
race chips (which I really, really like!).

Before I began, I spoke to Lars Giersing at A. Bauer Porsche Repair in Oakland, 
Kevin Buckler at The Racer's Group at Sears Point, several people at Powerhaus, 
Mr. Jon Milledge, and a few other people.  Here is what I learned:

Several people sell oil cooler kits.  Cooler sizes vary.  Most use AN 12 (-12) 
lines and fittings.  Some call for an "in series" installation with the factory 
cooler, and some simply get rid of it.

Milledge and Giersing both sell an oil/air separator kit.  This runs in series 
in the oil lines on the way to the cooler, with a vent line that runs up to the 
camshaft housing.

There seems to be no strong consensus on how big a cooler needs to be.  The 
Powerhouse cooler is huge-- about 5-6 inches high and 20-25 inches wide, and 
comes with all of the ncessary bracketry, et cetera.

Here is what I did:

I combined buying power with a friend who needed a cooler for his early 911.  
We bought two very large Mocal coolers from BAT in Sarasota, and got good 
advice and great prices.  The coolers measure about 5 - 6 iches high by 20 
inches wide and 2 inches deep.  This is the size that fits in the nose of a lot 
of 911 race cars which you've all seen pictures of.

I used 12 AN hoses and fittings throughout.  Since the cooler mounts in front 
of the radiator and A/C condensor, I was concerned about higher water temps due 
to obstruction of flow.  Therefore, I kept the original cooler plumbed in 
series.  The warm air first goes the the original cooler, then to the big giant 
one, before going back into the motor.

I also purchased Milledge's air separator kit, and installed the canister 
underneath the windshield washer reservoir.  You have to use a later style 
reservoir for this to fit.

Finally, I installed a VDO gauge to measure oil temperature.  Made a nice gauge 
panel for my center HVAC vent area for this gauge plus a VDO boost gauge.

The whole thing took a couple of days to install, and a modicum of fabrication 
and cleverness.

I won't know until May/June how well the cooling system works.  It gets up to 
105-110 ambient when we run in the central CA valley in the summer...

Would be happy to discuss/describe details by telephone with interested parties.
