Ok I can't resist it - here is my .02:
I drive an NA944 and find this whole debate rather odd. If I wanted the fastest car in the world it wouldn't be a 944 either NA or Turbo. I have some of the same problems that the first poster does, namely I enjoy my car greatly and I also like to work on it a lot. Adding items to the car is a form of personalization and can give pride in the ownership of a vehicle. It's also nice to see some performance gains as it gives a little boost (no pun intended) to the ego allowing you to say "I improved my car". I think that all of us know that a NA will never approach the straight line speed and acceleration of a Turbo but that is no reason to think it inferior. I for one like the balance of the NA better. I live in the land of twisty roads and many, oh so many, blind country curves, hills and dales. Having driven many other cars in this terrain I have found that the combination of medium power and great brakes and handling is the best for street driving. Track driving is another matter altogether (for that I have a 1966 Shelby GT350 with many mods).
Anyway - I too get a little tired of the "yours is not the best model" attitude especially from fellow 944 people. If someone wants to improve their car more power to them (pun is intended). Lets give them good advise and steer them away from the mounds of false adds and just plain crap (keep away form the Jacobson ignition stuff)
In retrospect Georges advice is about right - don't expect much in the way of performance gains (5hp might be on the conservative side!!) but if you enjoy working on your car fine. If you want to drive faster try some driver ed events, club events and time trials put on by other clubs. also you can play around with the suspension. If you want the fastest car possible get a cutting torch out a put in a bigger motor - you know they get about 5000hp from a top fuel drag motor!! 0 to 300 in 5 seconds.
Ok now someone else can have the soapbox.
