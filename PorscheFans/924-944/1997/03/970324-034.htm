Ok, my two bits....

first of all, the plate that takes the most balls to have (that I have seen)

IH8COPS (I hate Cops. I saw this on a BMW M6 years ago)

My personal favorite plate was on a Porsche with a big no fear sticker in the
back window and the plate was FEARNOT

My second favorite plate was XXXXXXXXX (you can have up to 9 digits in NY)

as for me, I like unusual plates. My Porsche has BB8B88B, with the font on my
plates, they look almost exactly a like. I get a lot of second looks, and at
lights I can see people in my rear view trying to read it. I have even had
cops pull along side at lights and ask about it and complement it...oh yea,
and on my truck I have on order 2TOWRCR (to tow race car or racer which ever
you like) - Doug

1987 Jeep Grand wagoneer 
1997 Acura CL (daily driver)
