On my '89 944, the gauge is usually at the bottom slash mark, when on the
road with constant airflow through the radiator.  In stop and go traffic,
both fans come on at low speed when the gauge reads just a bit over the
middle of the two marks, and brings the temp down to just above the first
slash mark before shutting off.  With the AC turned on, both fans come on
at low speed.  If it is just a blistering summer day with the AC on, the
needle will continue to rise to the upper slash mark (with low speed fans
still running, but unable to cope with the cooling load), then both fans
kick into high speed mode until the gauge drops to halfway, then we are
back in slow mode.  I only saw my car do this once or twice last summer -
very rare unless the engine is under extreme load or you are sitting in a
traffic jam in 100 degree (F) weather with the AC on. 

I think the earlier cars run just one fan, then two if the AC is turned
on, or the thermoswitch calls for more cooling.  Correct me please if I am
wrong.  However, when I bought my car, only one fan operated at high
speed, AC on or off, hot day or mild.  Suspect, I checked the fuses and
found one fan fuse burned out.  I replaced it, and all was well.  The fan
relay is clever in that if it senses there is an open circuit, it will
switch the remaining good fan to high speed mode automatically, to
help compensate for the missing fan.

The low speed fans run almost silently as they work.. They can't be heard
from inside the car. If you hear a fan running on high speed right off the
bat, check to see if the other is operable.
