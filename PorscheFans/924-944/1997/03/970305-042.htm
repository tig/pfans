I too, bought a 1989 Turbo that needs work.  When I inspected the car I
estimated about $3,000 in updates required.  As I begin the process of
restoration, I am happy to say that estimate was about right, if not a
little high.  But I am not bummed, there is still a chance I can go over
budget!

Regardless, I can not put a real value to any of my Porsches.  All have had
to have some maintenance done to them, and I am very satisfied that I
posses enough resources to own them.

I feel the real value of these cars lies in the hearts of the owners.  They
are worth almost whatever it costs to have them.  For me, that return is in
both driving and maintaining them.  It's not your father's Oldsmobile.

Marv (and the Porsche farm)
