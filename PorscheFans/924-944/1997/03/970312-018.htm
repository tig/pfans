Be careful of higher PSI caps.  I tried this in my Talon and ended up
blowing two hoses and who knows how much added stress was put on the
water pump seals, etc.

This is the best way to think of it.  Out here in Canada, a Supra TT I
was looking at was going for $44,000.  It was the new body style with a 
6-speed transmission, one of the ultimate japanese cars.  When I drove it,
I actually told the salesman (I really shouldn't have done this, it was
pretty rude), "This thing is a piece of sh*t!"  It did absolutely everything
I could throw at it perfectly, it turned in exactly how much I turned the
steering, it moved as soon as I touched the throttle (twin sequential turbos
you know!), it braked quickly even though the pedal had no feel, but the
doors still closed like a japanese car, the car still had no soul, and
it was $7,000 more than the 930 Turbo I had a deposit on.  I never did
get to drive the 930, I was too pissed off at the dealership because they
jacked up the price when I came to finally test drive the 930 I had the
deposit on.  In my anger, I decided to stop by Weissach Performance to 
see what they had in and took the 1989 944 Turbo for a boot.  Even though
it had crap wheels on it that made it tramline like crazy, it's pads were
all worn out and the car had the wickedest lean surge you've ever felt,
everything felt so right and that's why I own it today.  The most important
thing about all this ramble is that until I spend $14,000 in maintenance,
I'm still way ahead of that Supra driver in the lane next to me.  And that
$14,000 doesn't take into account the fact that I actually like driving
this car whereas I couldn't stand driving a Supra everyday;  they already
look dated.

This was a mistake.  I don't think Hoosier gives any documentation with
their tires, but I was lucky enough to be closely in contact with the 
Western US Hoosier rep and the local Hoosier rep.  Both were interested
to see the progress we made with the AWD race car, apparently we were
their first customers with that type of setup.

To make them last, they must be heat cycled.  Put them on the car on a hot,
dry day and drive them around the city, not doing anything cruel to them.
Once warm, bring them home, take them off and let them cool.  That's it.
The way they described it, you've heat cycled them enough when the sticker
goo is completely worn out, which took about 25km for mine of a bit of
agressive driving.

I would never insult your driving without first seeing you drive :)  Seriously,
the tire pressure is also crucial for the Hoosier to work right.  In the
3290lb Talon, we ran 45psi front and 40psi rear and they lasted the entire
season.  I am using the rear tires from the Talon as my rear tires on the 
Porsche now and we ran two drivers last year on them.  The car took numerous
first, seconds and thirds.  There was a local guy that ran the same tire
pressure as his R1's and he corded the tire in two events!  On the Porsche,
I'm starting at 44psi front and rear.

I would never use these as a street/track tire.  The R1 and Yokos are good
for that, but the Hoosier is *not*.

Haha!  I think what's happened out here is that I like the car so much, I
keep convincing all my friends to buy them.  This artifically raises my car
value :)

Out of the $4200, about $1000 went to warranty deductables for the various
claims made (each time it goes in, it's a $200 deductable).  Of the remaining
costs, most were for routine maintenance like brake rotors, etc.  The biggest
single bill I've had so far was from the water damage, that was $1500 to
fix.

Here is a modified list from an Excel spreadsheet I keep:
