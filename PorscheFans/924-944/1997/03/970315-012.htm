I don't have to pass emissions any more, 'cause my car is too old, but it
always did when I had to.  By a *lot*.  This is, mind you, with an
estimated 300K miles on what's basically the original engine.  (The
odometer stuck at 140K, so I really have to guess.)

Just so you have another frame of reference, a friend of mine with an '88
Fiero -- with, apparently, *two* ECSs built in -- didn't do as well as
you.  I believe he got 20 PPM HC and 0.2% CO at idle.  Dunno if we even
have the 2500 rpm measurement here.

Porsche sure doesn't shortchange us in emissions control.
