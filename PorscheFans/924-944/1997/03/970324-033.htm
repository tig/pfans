The responses I received did not give instructions as to how the the cam
seal is replaced, so I am going to post my question again.  I am
specifically after information about how you keep everything in place, i.e.
TDC, because the cam sprocket has to be removed to get at the seal.  What
prevents the cam from turning? How do you get everything back to spec? etc.
etc. The balance shaft seals were not hard because even if you screwed up,
you can get it back to spec by making sure the woodruff key is facing up
for both rollers and the upper says "O", the lower says "U".  

I purchased the seal kit from "Whale Tail" in Ontario Canada. They sell the
kit for $102 CDN. (about $73 US). The dealer sells the kit for about $150
CDN (part # 000 043 065 00 for an 87 951).
Buying the seals individually at the dealer works out to about the same cost.

Looking for experienced cam seal experts.
