     I just picked up my car this morning, after four months of 
     anticipation and almost $7,000 Cdn. worth of parts and labour, I was 
     going to enjoy it today since it is a beautiful day here in Toronto.  
     Alas, it didn't last more than an hour because the oil pressure light 
     came on and right back to the shop it went.
     
     We discovered oil in the coolant so one of two things: blown head 
     gasket or blown oil cooler gasket.  Has anyone else had this 
     experience before??  I've been told that it does happen, every once in 
     awhile and there really isn't anything preventative that can be done 
     about it.  It's really a shame because the car drove beautifully, 
     albeit for only an hour.  BTW, the Autothority short shift kit is 
     beautiful, I'm still getting used to its throws, but it's a nice 
     addition.  Someone please let me know if they've experience this 
     before and what else can go wrong??  I'm beginning to wonder if I can 
     support this car!!
