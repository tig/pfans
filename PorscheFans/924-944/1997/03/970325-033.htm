Ezra -- please keep us up to date with how your work is going. I for one
am about to embark on a lot of the same fixes you're working on but am
still in the parts-and-tool collection mode. This weekend will be trying
to remove enough parts to get to the timing and balance belts for a
check... I definitely have a small oil leak under there somewhere.
Interested in learning from your experiences. Thanks in advance//Pete
Jones
