I needed to replace the hoses on my fuel lines, so I 
cut the fuel lines with a hacksaw just aft of the 
passenger side front wheel well.  Then, I took the 
short part with the hoses to a hose shop and had 
the hoses replaced.  Finally, I had to track down
a place that sold high quality compression fittings
and used those to reconnect the steel lines.  The
result looks very professional under the car, and
cost a total of US$52 and a little sweat.
