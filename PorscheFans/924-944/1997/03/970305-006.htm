Hi Mike.
Thanks for the reply - BTW I read your 951 clutch replacement 'novel' quite a while ago, in fact before I brought my 944. It's a great piece of automotive literature!! Thankfully the job on the 944 has been much easier. I was impressed when all the fasteners came loose on my 10 year old car - including the original exhaust nuts and bolts!! (only beheaded one bolt - a pressure plate bolt)

On to your sun roof question - when you say that you have to hold down the button and nothing happens - is there any noise or complete silence? Also look at your sun roof motor and see if  you have a early or late style sun roof. The entire system was changed some time in 86 including the motor, track, cables and latches. The later motor looks very similar to a window motor and is smaller than the early style. The early style does not have any connectors in between the motor and the relays - it's hard wired.
With this info I can give you the possible fixes.
Once Again - great 951 clutch 'novel'
