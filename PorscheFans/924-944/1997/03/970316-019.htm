<< I too would like to know about roof racks for 944s.  In working on the
 logistics of driving to distant (>400 miles) track events in the 944, I've
 figured out that I can carry a passenger, 3 track wheels/tires, a large
 jack and light luggage inside the car, but the fourth wheel has to go
 outside.  A roof rack would seem the solution.  Has anybody gone this
 route? If so, what are the options and prices?

Nick,
I often travel to events this way, especially when my kids come along.
I have THULE racks, and I use the basic rain gutter hooks that came with
them, though I had to bend them to change the angle a little so the door
would
close without pinching the rubber too badly. The rear hooks fit nicely in the

space over the rear quarter window.   Be sure to straddle the sunroof with
the 
towers so the weight rests on the strong part of the roof.  Have fun!
