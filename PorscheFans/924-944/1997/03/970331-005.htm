I just got back from a fantastic event.  What a hoot.  It was an auto-x
with only four cars attending!  Yahoo!

I got just under 20 runs in, and Paul got in well over 20 runs.  This
how it went:

The event started at 2:00pm with a short course that was really fun, lot's
of speed (safe of course) and lots of turning with a killer hairpin.
Everyone except Arnie and Jenny were running street tires.
In the morning session, I got FTD on my street tires with Paul
second, Arnie third, Cameron fourth and Jenny was having fun more than
anything.

Next session, we added another lap to the course to elongate our fun.  Arnie
was FTD for a while, then I took over FTD, then Paul, then back to Arnie,
then Paul again, then I blew the doors off Paul (2 seconds faster), then
Paul spent about 10 runs catching me and finally put close to a second
on me and then we called it a day because the wind was getting crazy and
blowing our cones over.  Times were Paul first, me second, Arnie third,
Cameron fourth.

A great event, thanks to Arnie and SWCC.  It's just what I needed after
watching the F1 race, except I didn't put it onto the marbles at the first
corner :)

Paul and I are finally coming to terms with the handling of this car,
although it feels sloppy inside the car, it looks smooth as silk from
outside so we're heading in the right direction.  We've finally figured
out how to keep the thing pointing straight instead of sliding back and
forth, we're keeping the throttle firmly planted in the carpet when it 
starts to walk sideways.  What a rush slithering through offset gates
with over a bar of boost with the steering wheel pointing in all sorts of
directions trying to keep the car going where you want it and somehow, it
all works out and the car goes exactly where you wanted faster than you
expected, what a car, WHAT A CAR!

For the people on the list that don't auto-x their cars or track them, you
really are missing out on another dimension of your car.  Take this event
for example, all you would have needed was a Snell 90 helmet and a good
working condition street car.  Both Paul and myself ran on street tires
and it was ridiculous fun.  The car is so good on tire wear too, almost none.
The only thing that took a beating were the brakes and even they worked
just fine after.  You really have no idea what this car is all made of
when you push it on a highway onramp with one eye over your shoulder and
the other at your destination, you have to put your mind focused on one
thing and it feels so good to move this car around where you want it.

Email me private if you want more info on how to get into this type of
racing, it's cheap (well, it can get expensive if you go crazy, Joe's
Phantom is rumoured to have cost close to C$100,000 to build!), fun and
safe fkassam@direct.ca

1989 Porsche 944 Turbo (the more boost, the better).
Ahhhh, Turbochargers, the ultimate replacement for displacement!
