I've spent some time over the last few weeks reading some of the 924/944 
archives, and boy are my eyes tired!  But really, what a wealth of info. 
Thanks for all the posts, everyone.  I'm looking to buy one soon, 
preferably an S2, and this has made for a good homework source.

Now, I'll be going to Florida (from Chicago) in a couple of weeks for a 
vacation, and it dawned on me to possibly get my dream car while I'm 
there, as the availability and price both seem to be better.  Two 
questions: does anybody who lives in the Tampa/Orlando area have a 
Porsche shop to recommend for prepurchase inspection and any preventitive 
maintenance I have done before making the 1000 mile trip home?  Also, are 
there any things I should worry about/check for in buying a sunshine 
state car?  I used to live there, and vaguely remember wires corroding 
like crazy (I ended up redoing the electrical system in my Ghia) and 
paint getting bleached/dryed.

TIA for any advice,

Jerry
