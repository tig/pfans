Having previously owned an '86 944 and currently an '86 951, I empathize
with Kevin.  It seems that I could push my old 944 a lot more often with
out attracting undue attention to myself.  With the 951, things happen
at a much higher level, so I constantly find myself holding back a bit,
hence dampening my fun.  Taking her (with stage II chip) up through the
first three gears means breaking 100mph (Seattle police *really* don't
like that).  Both cars are wonderful, they just have different strengths
-- heck, I wish I still owned both!

As for the start of this thread, I would like to add my $0.02:  This is
the only mailing list or newsgroup of its size that I know of, which is
comprised of genuinely nice people.  I think that experiences with other
groups whose members seem to enjoy flaming one another, can lead a new
person at PorscheFans to misread the intent behind a statement.  Someone
offered the sage advice that we should each take a moment to reread our
comments before we hit the send button.  I agree, but given the spirit
of this list, perhaps we should also do the same before we reach for the
reply button.

Okay, now I'm off *my* soapbox  BTW I am on the digest, so please send
all flames directly to me :-)
