Here's some info on the Stinger battery:

o  Comes in two sizes, 800 and 1000 (don't know what those numbers
actually mean though).
o  Package size (model SPB-800) of 17.6 cm x 16.7 cm x 12 cm, or for us
metrically challenged in the US, that's 6 15/16 x 6 9/16 x 4 5/8 inch.
o  Weight, 23.4 lbs and 32.4 lbs.
o  Construction is 99.994% pure lead plate with 100% maintenance-free
copper/alloy terminals and sealed case.
o  Can withstand 400 cycles of 100% total discharge.  500 at 80%.
o  Battery is UPS shippable by ground or air.
o  Price is about $230 and $280 US, which is about twice what I paid for
my Optima.
o  No mounting hardware is provided.  Looks like it will require a custom
installation for just about any car.

I saw one today and the SPB-800 is quite small and light compared to my
Optima.  It looks quite good.  However, I do not see anything on the spec
sheet that actually gives the Cold Cranking Amps of these batteries or =
the
rated reserve.  These are standard battery type ratings that may not =
apply
to this type of construction.  The main features of the Stinger seem to =
be
its small size, light weight and deep cycle capability for audio use with
the engine off.  I still think the Optima provides equal (or better?)
performance in a normal starting application.  The race shop where I
purchased my Optima sells a lot of them for drag car usage on big block
engines.

Hope this helps.
