     Rob,
     
     Reach under the lip of the fender wells.  The Turbo S had those wells 
     "rolled" to allow for a wider wheel/tire combination.  If you have a 
     944 now you will understand when you reach under and grab it.
>>>> Now that's right, but many trackees do this so it's not foolproof.
     
     Also the '88 should sport the "S" after the Turbo insignia on the 
     back.
>>>> Bullshit.     

     Front shocks should be Koni with the adjustable perch.
>>>>Too easy...many turbos had shocks upgraded.  The standard upgrade gets you
adjustable Konis - but not HEIGHT adjustable.
     
     Sound system should have the 6 speaker system with four of the 
     speakers in the doors.  Two speakers are located in the armrests.
>>>> Actually turboS has 10 speakers.  See pano 3/88
   
     Also get the VIN number and call PCNA.  They can tell you every 
     possible thing about the cars original specifications you would want 
     to know.
>>>>  WAY too much trouble.
