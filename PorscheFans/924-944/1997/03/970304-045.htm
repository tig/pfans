Hello all:

I recently bought a 1978 924 in hopes of fixing it up.  The previous owner
did some... interesting things to this poor car, including putting different
wheel bolts on it, but that's another problem.  As an aside, is it true that
the 1978 924's braking system is similar to that of the Rabbit of the era?
I've got to replace a wheel bolt on it, and the stock 924 ones won't fit...

Ever since I bought the car, I've noticed that before the engine is warmed
up, if I hit the gas, the revs drop - sometimes to the point of stalling.
Once the engine is warm, the problem goes away and it runs fine (except for
the idle, which is about 1-2K and the oil pressure, which appears to be 
2-4 kpa).  I think it's either fuel or air or both, but I'm stumped.

Any ideas?  I'd appreciate any help you can offer.
