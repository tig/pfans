Subject: Thinking of buying a 968

I subscribed to the service a few weeks ago hoping to get some
feedback on 968's. I don't see anyone talking about this model. I
have a 87 944s with 78k which runs great. Should I be thinking of a
968 as an upgrade. The specs look better. I have yet to find one to
test drive.

Any Feedback?

Richard, I am a former 87 944 turbo owner who purchased a 1992 968 Cab. 
last year. Both cars are great but I love the 968. I bought it because I 
have always loved the looks of the car and the prices are finally coming 
down now that the boxster is here. The 3 biggest differences between the 
2 cars are as far as I'm concerned are 1) torque, the 968's flat torque 
curve means that the car responds faster then the Turbo when asked. 
2)refinement, although Porsche wanted to call this a new model it was 
really the last 944, but it was the cleanest in design and built in 
Stuttgart. 3)Believe it or not, it's easier to work on! Take a look under 
the hood of a Turbo 944 vs a 968. I did basic maintenance on both and the 
968 is much easier. On the bad side, it is hard to get parts except at 
the dealer and there you have to pay. But it's a great car!!! Contact me 
if you need more details.
