In the last SCCA type of event I ran, we were classed in "B Prepared" which
is where I think we'll be throughout the year.  SCCA is not very turbo
friendly, usually outclassing them considerably when the boost is up.  In
stock form, you would run "A Stock", then you would move up to "A Street
Prepared" with certain mods (I think suspension related).

I would think that a stroker motor would but you immediately in B/P if not
D Mod or some other Mod class.  If Bill Buetow is reading this, he'd know
the classes off the top of his head, I'm sure.

My opinion on your KLR chip, leave it in there.  Run a higher class until
you get to terms with the car, enjoy the power you have, don't let a 
sanctioning body ruin your fun.  When it comes time that you are maxed out
in your car, then modify the car to suit the classing structure.  Until then,
let the slick-shod 600hp corvettes kick your butt.  If it's a two day 
combined time event, you'll probably beat them anyways, since they tend
to break quite frequently.

Farzaan.
