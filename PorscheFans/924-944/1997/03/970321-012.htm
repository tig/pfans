Someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I do NOT believe it
can be the fans. Notice that the temp is high even when the car
is driven on the highway. At highway speeds, the fans do nothing.

So, it could be the waterpump, the thermostat, the gauge, the head
gasket, a blockage somewhere, or maybe space aliens, but not (to the 
best of my knowledge) the fans. 

Personally, I would squeeze the radiator outlet hose while some one
revved the motor to try and feel if you have coolant flow. I'd also
check the head, hoses, and water pump area for signs of leaks.

Other than that, you're on your own.

good luck,
