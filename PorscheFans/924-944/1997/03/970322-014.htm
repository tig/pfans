Hello all:

Early 1985 944 80K; from idle the car will hesitate strongly upon launching
in first gear under full throttle.  If you let up on the accelerator the car
can be brought up to above 2500 rpm and then all seems normal.  In addition,
the car will stall if one does not let up on the gas during launch.  No
symptoms under high speed or RPM. This problem came on gradually but only
when the car was cold; now it presents itself at all times.

Today I cleaned the entire air intake system up to the throttle plate from
the air box, including the air flow meter and assorted hoses.

There was an improvement, the car was less hesitant to hesitate and it would
not stall under full throttle, but things are still not right.

I have checked all the vacuum conections and fuel and ignition seem fine.
Fuel pressure checks out and there is no high speed miss.

Does this sound like an air flow meter problem and is the meter able to be
serviced; or is it likely to be related to ignition or fuel directly?  In
addition, waht other sensors in the air intake system could cause this?

That is about all for now.

TIA

Paul
