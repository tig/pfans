Last November, I tried a set of Hoosier tires on my '87 951.  The car has a set 
of Milledge race chips and has been converted to Turbo S specs, except for not 
having an ABS system.  It is a pretty much full weight car.  I had experience 
with BFG R1s and Yoko A008s before I tried the Hoosiers. I bought the road race 
version.

Anyway, in the first AX where I used them at Candlestick Park (now "3 Com 
Park") I went through the front tires after about 16 runs.  That's 16 runs in 
the high RPM range in second gear (we can run pretty hard because we have a big 
space at the 'stick).  When I say "went through," here is what I mean:

(i) The tires were brand new and I put them on in the parking lot in the 
morning.

(ii) Both front tires were corded and flat spotted.  Both my wife and I have 
lots of AX seat time and know how to threshold brake.  I have since heard that 
Hoosiers are much easier to lock up because they are so much lighter (they have 
only a fiberglass belt package-- no steel).


(iii) During the 16th run, I was riding as my wife's instructor and we actually 
blew one of the front tires out.  Yup, went right through the belt package!  
Good thing I had my street tires along.

So, be careful with these tires.  They are quite fragile, and don't work great 
for a long time.  When they were sticky, they were great, but $300 for 16 runs 
is not, IMHO a good price to pay for 16 AX runs.  Back to R1s for now.
