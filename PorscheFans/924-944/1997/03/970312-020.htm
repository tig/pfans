There should be downside as far as wear is concerned.  I'm actually stunned
at how good the tires are lasting on the Porsche.  Since I don't have any
other experience with this car, I can only assume it's a function of
alignment settings, a good suspension and correct tire pressures.  I was
expecting to need a new set of tires this summer, but it looks like they'll
last right through it.

I wanted to know if anyone on the list has the TSB for tire pressures
for the recommended 17" wheel/tire combo from Porsche for the 944 Turbo
models.  I was on AllData yesterday and they had a TSB for this.  I
was curious as to what tire pressure they recommend with the 17"
tires.

Don't get the PZero, I've had nothing but problems with them.  They only
get the thump, thump, thump flat spot when sitting around for more than
a week, but I had two crack, another replacement was totally different
than the other three.  It was a nightmare.

Farzaan.
