1st off, I agree with the masses that this list is extremely useful and
helpful to the world of Porsches.  What makes it that way is the vast
diversity of the members; we have both ends of the spectrum and everything in
between.  You want help?  You got it.  You want to state an opinion, you may.
 Let's all remember that we have a wonderful resource available here.  Let's
keep it as such.

I, for one, have an '84 944 that suits me just fine. I wanted a fun car to
drive at an affordable price, which I got in spades.  I suppose a turbo would
be "fun", but as a previous poster pointed out, it's easier to let the NA 944
wind through the gears without much attention than it is a turbo.  Nothing
cures a bad day at the office as a pristine day, good tunes on the radio, the
windows down, and a Porsche cradling your body.  I fully support the position
that it's the driver's skill behind the wheel rather than the power under the
hood.  Join PCA; get involved in what your local region has available.  Do a
driver's ed.  You don't *have* to do everything.  Personally, at this point
in my life, I have no interest in autocross or time trials.  I enjoy them,
but with two sons aged 9 & 13, my priorities at this point in my life are
just different.  A few years from now, I'm sure my position will change.
 Ain't America great, that we can change our minds when we want, as
conditions change?  Anyway, we still participate in the local PCA events when
we have the opportunity.  The comraderie (sp?) is wonderful.

Now for the subject of my post (sorry for the bandwidth). A local chap was
advertising a '78 911S for $4900, so I went to take a look at it.  Regardless
of my love for my 944, I admit I've always longed for the "look" of a 911.
 It was in decent cosmetic shape; no concours winner by a long shot, but
given it's age, definitely not trashed.  Recent (2 yrs) paint job.  No $3000
job, but passable (i.e., "most" of the gaskets were not painted).  I'm
familiar with the 2.7 engine woes, but this engine was rebuilt in '88 with
the Dilavar (sp?) studs.  Other inherent problems, I know....

Once on the road, I must say I was disappointed.  Acceleration was not what I
would expect.  Handling was worse.  Not horrible; for some stupid reason, I
guess I just thought the 911 would handle better.  I know, I know, I've read
all the posts about a 944 being able to outperform a 911 in the curves, but I
guess I just succumbed to the 911 "mystique".  Another point:  the gearshift
lever felt so "noodly" compared to the 944 that I found myself having to
think through each shift, rather than concentrating on the road.  So I turned
it down.  Probably the last chance I'll find one so inexpensive.  Yes, I
realize that you get what you pay for, and I'm aware that this is probably
the least desirable of all the Porsches, but it was *so* close.....

Anyway, I climbed back in my comfortable 944, and just wound it out on the
way home.  Home *is* where the heart is.

'84 944
& other sundry transportation not nearly as much fun or worth mentioning....
