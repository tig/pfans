Hello fellow list members - 
Just thought I would let you know about an interesting phone conversation I had today. I was talking to Ron at Eurospeed about a couple of parts I have on order and I told him about PorscheFans and I then suggested that since we are approx. 1200 944 owners that he should consider giving a discount to us!! Guess what? Ron thought that this was a pretty good idea and said that anyone mentioning PorscheFans would be offered an additional discount!! (I found his prices pretty good already)
If you call Eurospeed make sure you talk to Ron - 1-800-352-9441.
Ron is also working with the Snap-on folks to offer a tool to replace the 'famous' belt tensioning tool at a much better price. (Not available yet - I want one already).
Usual disclaimer - I have no interest in Eurospeed other than a satisfied customer. I figure that if Eurospeed benefits from our list we should benefit also!! - I am also tired of talking to parts shops that know less than I do about 944's.
Boy I hope I don't sound like a commercial!
