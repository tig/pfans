I came across a deal on an 88 Turbo S that was too good to pass up, so now I
have to part with my 85.5.  I use it for street and track, and I'll sell it
in either trim.
If I sell it to someone who's only interested in street driving, I'll sell
off whatever
track parts aren't transferable to the Turbo S.  Let me know if you're
interested in 
either the car or the track goodies.
Here's some info:

--104,000 miles; mine since '91 and 26,000 miles (second owner)
--daily driver and quick track car 
--mechanically excellent (I'm obsessive about that); all systems work well;
runs great
     -cam and balance shaft belts at about 85,000 
     -Compression 165-170 in all cylinders
     -recent front rotors, caliper rebuild, braided stainless steel lines,
Cool Carbons
     -brake ducts
     -new rt side motor mount
     -new throttle switch
     -new battery
     -updated waterpump at 45,000 miles
     -new front wheel bearings
     -repacked CV's
     -recent Koni Yellows all around w/ 250 lb springs in front
     -frequent fluid changes
     -needs nothing but a couple of summer tires at this point
--cosmetically some blemishes (a few paint chips and scratches, some small
cracks           
   in dash) but overall very attractive in Burgundy and black leather
--hidden remote radar detector
--Have most, if not all, receipts

The car's a great blend of fun and practicality -- gets me to work everyday,
and hustles around the track pretty quickly as well (high 66" range at Lime
Rock).
That would be good enough to put you well up on the grid in I Stock at LRP.
I'm a member of the PCA Hudson Champlain Region; live in Albany area.
Instruct for PCA, BMWCCA and TrackMasters.
Price reasonable; negotiable depending on what's included.
I'm thinking an asking range of $6,000 - $7,500, negotiable, depending on
"options."
I'd include or exclude the following, based on buyer's desires and price
negotiation:
--Roll bar/harness
--Fuchs (2)7x15 and (2) 8x15 (all excellent)and/or
--Cookie Cutter (4)7x15 (rough looking but straight and true)
--(4) 60% worn Blizzaks
--(2) very good and (2) not as good Toyo Proxes RA-1 track tires
--Weltmeister Anti-Sway Bars (or Turbo S bars)
--CamberBall upper strut bearings
--Europroducts chip

Of course, inspection by mechanic of purchaser's choice would be welcome.
If interested, contact me via email or phone (day=518-457-4335;
eve=518-674-5391)

Thanks,
Kevin Belden
