Need some advice..

I just bought a 1985 1/2 944 with 60K miles on it  - two weeks after I
got it, the water pump developed a leak!  The place I bought it did pay
for a replacement, but complications have occurred..

The service shop couldn't find the original waterpump - the new one was
installed with "modifications"  - does anybody understand the mods
required?

As soon as I picked up the car, I noticed a severe vibration that
increases with revs.  I called back to the shop and was told that since
all belts were also replaced at the same time,  a vibration is normal
with new belts.  Anyone experienced this?

The vibration is severe enough to rattle the dash at 4000 rpm.  Also,
FYI, the engine mounts have already been updated, - that was the first
thing I though of .
