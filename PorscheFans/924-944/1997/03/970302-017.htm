As some of you already know, I have recently (last Wednesday) purchased a
1989 944 Turbo (Turbo S).  The car needs some work like the suspension,
brakes, and some creature comforts fixed, but still seems outstanding when
driven and compared to my 87 944 and 87 944S.

I would like to thank all of you on this list for helping me make this
possible.  I think each of you, in your own ways, have helped contribute
something to me either directly, or indirectly.  I wanted all of you to
know that.

For those of you that have never experienced the Turbo S, the car leaves
the gate like a projectile from a Navy rail gun; blindingly fast and
purposeful in its mission.  And it does it without losing its composure.
If any of you are considering upgrading to a Turbo, I can only offer these
humble words:

Just do it!

I was asked to submit to the list the following thoughts I recorded the
night I got the car.  I still feel the same about the car, if not more so.

*****  *****  *****

Impressions:

I just had to drive it to my evening class tonight.  Unfortunately it has
been raining moderately at times.  The road was slick and oily, but I still
had a blast.

I am most impressed with the civility of the car.  You can mope along with
traffic and it will not fuss or skip a beat.  If your on the highway it
cruses about 10 mph faster than you think.  Fourth gear at 70 mph seems
perfect.  You almost forget there is one more slot to go.  Even in fourth
gear at 3200 rpm you can put the pedal down and it picks up the pace like a
thoroughbred horse with the self assurance that this is his run today.  Not
brutal, nor reckless, but with poise and confidence.  Then the tach crosses
the ignition point and the afterburners kick in like a surge of adrenalin.
There was a sensation, a blur of speed, or something that feeds your senses
as traffic just falls back behind you.  The acceleration is liquid smooth,
almost electric.  The 180 mph speedo seems to, all at once, cry "catch me
if you can".  The needle on the speedo arcs over the numbers, crossing them
off methodically one by one.  There isn't even a hint of effort expelled in
the process for either the car or the driver.  It is all so matter of fact.
Even when shifting gears as merge from the on ramps and the tail gets a
touch loose, the car and driver do not loose composure.  The limited slip
keeps the nose pointed in the intended direction like a compass.

As always, the game must come to an end, and you pull your foot off the
pedal and stand down.  The momentum still carries you along for a bit, but
then you start to blend back into the traffic again, even though you are
going 10 mph faster than the average.  Still, do not want to excite the
occasional hot head motorist.  Once at parity with the crowd, you are still
not part of the group.  The car provides a sort of isolation from the
frustration most drivers endure when trying to get from point A to point B.
It is not the same as my other cars.  I suspect that to draw the same level
excitement and joy as the Turbo S delivers, requires you to drive them
harder.  You need to wring those feelings out of the 944.  It will pay back
nicely, but they must be driven.  The Turbo S, on the other hand, gives
freely without even breaking a sweat.  You are rewarded unconditionally.

The clutch is a bit heavier than my other cars, but not overly so.  After a
short while it feels quite natural and returning to the standard 944 feels
like something is broken down there.  Everything else is familiar.  The
wider tires (225 X 50 X 16" front and 245 X 45 X 16" rear) just seem to add
to the stability of the car.  They plant you into the pavement with deep
roots.  On some of the more worn roads that has had heavy truck traffic,
they wheels may tend to follow the grooves a bit more.  Then again, this
suspension is a bit worn and I am eager to refresh both front and rear.

What does not require refreshing is the wonderful power plant that is
tucked under the hood.  The Turbo has a unique note to the ears.
Particularly when it is exercised and the windows are down.  The 944 has a
nice snarl, and the 944S with the four valves hovering over each cylinder
makes its own delicious sound.  But the Turbo whine sings to you in such
seductive sweetness, like the mythical Sirens from across the shore.  Yet
rest assured that there are no nymphs lurking under this car luring you to
your peril.  The Turbo has graduated from charm school with a 4.0 average
cum laude.  There is always enough feedback to let the driver know exactly
what is happening at the boundary layer between the four tires and the road
without sensory overload.  The is no conflict between car and driver, but a
oneness that prevails.

And if the sights, sounds and sensory perceptions of the vehicle are not
enough, then there is the wonderful sound system to entertain your temporal
lobes.  The Reno Blaupunkt radio and equalizer feed a stream of sound into
speakers that are mounted everywhere.  Porsche stole the space that is used
for storage under the door armrests for a battery of speakers and then
mounted two more at the top front of the doors for additional high end
coverage.  It does not thump like some of the boom boxes that roll down my
street, but it is a far better improvement over the stock 944 sound system.

Finally, gone are those ugly rear seat belt retainers that break and crack.
Enter shoulder harnesses that have been added.  I guess they comply with
Federal regulations.

Oh well, I will not get much driving in tomorrow as I have a business trip
to attend, but I am looking forward to some dry roads.  Then again, this
car has not inspired me into reckless speed.  You don't have to prove
anything to anyone.  You feel that there is plenty of power held in reserve
at your beck and call.  I like sprinting once in a while down the on ramps,
but slicing and dicing through traffic is a hazard I avoid.  Besides, it
like having bad gas at a party as you thread your way through the crowd.
You don't see the faces behind you, but somehow you know you are not making
a favorable impression.  Worse yet, you may run into some of them again!
