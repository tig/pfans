 There as been some discussion last week on recommended anti-freeze for 
Porsche vehicles. I have a copy on a PCNA technical bulletin that may 
resolve the  anti-freeze debate. The text of the technical bulletin is 
as follows;


 PCNA Technical Bulletin
 Model: 4 Cyl & 8 Cyl
 Group: 1
 Part Identifier: 1901
 Number: 9408
 Date: August 30, 1994

 Subject: Approved Anti-Freeze


 Attention: Service Manager/Service Technician

 Models Affected: 924, 944, 968 and 928

 Concern: Use of approved phosphate free anti-freeze in Porsche all 
          aluminum engines.

          All full-aluminum water cooled Porsche engines should only use
          approved, phosphate free anti-freeze. This anti-freeze may be
          obtained from Audi/Volkwagen or Mercedes Benz dealers under
          the brand names "Autobahn" and "Mercedes Benz" respectively.
          Where available, "Zerex Extreme 450" may also be used.

 General Information: The anti-freeze in not only for freeze/boiling 
                      protection, but also protects the cooling system from
                      corrosion. To have a correct corrosion protection
                      level in the coolant system, anti-freeze must remain
                      in the coolant system year round. Therefore, the
                      concentration of anti-freeze to water should not be 
                      less than 30% by volume.

 Mixing: Different makes of anti-freeze usually mix; however, in some there
         are great differences in quality. Therefore, the concentration of
         anti-freeze to water should not be less than 30% by volume. A
         higher than 55% by volume anti-freeze concentration should be avoided,
         since the heat dissipation ability of the coolant will be reduced.

 Coolant Volume: Type 924      approx.  7.0 liters
                 Type 944/968  approx.  7.8 liters
                 Type 928      approx. 16.0 liters
        
 Topping-up of Coolant: The effectiveness of the anti-freeze in the coolant 
                        becomes less after a longer time period of operation.
                        If, due to coolant loss, coolant/anti-freeze must be 
                        added, an approved quality anti-freeze should be used.
                        In this case it need not be the same approved brand.

 Coolant Change: Every two (2) years, the coolant/anti-freeze should be
                 changed to assure the effectiveness of the coolant. If the
                 engine coolant has to be drained on car in service over one
                 (1) year, it is recommended to use new anti-freeze.

 Important Note: Anti-freeze with ethylene glycol or propylene glycol base is
                 available; however, anti-freeze with propylene glycol base is
                 not approved for Porsche vehicles.

                 The corrosion protection and anti-freeze characteristics of
                 propylene glycol and ethylene glycol are different, although
                 their physical characteristics are similar. A simple test is 
                 not possible to differentiate between the two. If propylene
                 glycol is used or added to a Porsche vehicle or if it is
                 not know what type of anti-freeze has been used, the anti-
                 freeze should be changed completely to an approved brand.
