Surya, the bearing is at the top of the strut. In one of th last 6-8 months
of "Excellence" mag there is a break down in the Tech Forum. The bearing is
pressed into the top housing (by hand). The bearing is in two pieces. The 
bearing itself is in the rubber and the race is on the strut. It iss very to
It is very very easy to check. Jack up the car. Hold the wheel one had at 
12 the other at 6. Rock like you are checking the wheel bearing and watch the
coiled spring. If the coiled spring moves there is too much movement in the
bearing. Another way is to grab the spring and move it back and forth. You 
do not need to pull and push too hard. Believe my I had the shimmy for over 
a year. I even purchased a small wheel balancer from JC Whitney. I went
to "Goodyear" and they gave me some stick on weights. I used to balance
my tires nightly it was so frustrating. I
ould never drive more then 55 or 60
mph because it vibrated so much. It just wasn't much fun to drive. I even 
turn in my "KYB'S" twice (life time warranty). I was able to remove the struts 
in 10 -15 each side. The only way I found this was when I was checking the bearings and focused on th spring behind the tire. The movement in the spring did
not look right. Another thing was that I broke one of the 4 studs holding the
top of the strut to the body because the "Haynes" manual had the wrong 
torque for the nut I think it said 52lbs. It is a #6 nut only needs 14lbs.
I spun it right off. This is how much I worked on it. Like I stated once
I changed the bearing I was up to 100mph no vibration. Good Luck.
