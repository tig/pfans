One of the components which helps prevent runon is the idle-speed
stabilizer.  They do tend to get filled with all sorts of grease and dirt.
When you shut off the key it's supposed to close, shutting off the normal
air passage to the engine and helping prevent runon.  If the car is running
fine otherwise, it is possible that the idle bypass (a 7mm bolt set in what
looks like wax on the throttle body) around the idle-speed stabilizer is
adjusted too far open and is defeating the idle-speed stabilizer.

As for fuel: No, the problem won't be high-octane fuel, since higher octane
is supposed to be less prone to preignition (which is the cause of
knocking).  Regardless, the 85.5 944 that we both have isn't nearly as
high-compression as later models.

Let us know how it turns out.
