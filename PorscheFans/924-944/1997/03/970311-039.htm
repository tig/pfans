I'm new to this list and I have a few things for sale:

1)  Autothority Stage II chips for an 86-87 944 Turbo for sale; bought
in January of 1996 and used in my 944 Turbo for a short time(I traded
the car in two months after I installed the chips).  Autothority claims
270bhp and max torque comes on 500 rpm earlier.  Quarter mile times are
13.5 vs. 14.4 stock.  My buisiness is computer hardware &software, so
the chips were/are handled with the utmost of care.  They are in the
original pacaging and I have the receipts from Windward Performance
where I bought them for $419. (The registration card is still in the
package too.)

2)  I also have the K&N panel filter(which is in excellent condition and
has been freshly cleaned and re-oiled) - paid $45.

3)  I also have a low-temp thermostat-switch to turn the fans on at a
lower temperature(never installed) - paid $19.

4)  The last items on the list are Bosch Platinum plugs and the Bosch
Triple-Electrode plugs for turbos each set has less than 500 miles -paid
$50.

Basically I took all the parts off of the car because the dealer said he
wouldn't give me any more or any less for my car with the parts listed
above.  These would be great for anyone with a stock 86-87 944 Turbo
looking for more power.

I'll take $295 for everything.  I can be reached at one of the following
places:
jason@media.stumedia.lsu.edu
psychodyne@aol.com

or call me at (504)343-9088 and leave a message.

Thanks!
