Hi Dave,

A repair bill of $3,500 for two accidents is extremely low which either means
it wasn't fully repaired, or the accidents were VERY minor.  Before buying the
car, have it inspected by a known Porsche experienced body shop.  Ask a local
PCA member for who is the recommended shop in your area.

I would look for two items:

1.  Does the rear glass fit the contours of the body correctly; both fore and
aft, and left and right?  The glass is never wrong, so if there is some
misfit, the body is wrong.

2.  Pay the body shop to remove the rear bumper cover and inspect the hidden
portion of the car exposed once the cover is removed.  A poor repair will be
evident once the bumper cover is removed.  Also have the rear control arm
mounts inspected for any damage.  In northern California, the
removal/replacement of the cover will cost about US$150, but your labor rate
may be cheaper.

Good luck!

...Gary
