When I got my 944 last year, I decided to do the hoses but
winter came too soon. I paid a good mechanic to do it and he
suggested replacing the heater hoses as well, which are often
ignored. I don't Performance puts them in their hose kits for
the 944. He said that they were a real pain and he complained
that he had estimated only 2 hours to do the job.

I've had no problems since then.
