I think that the Windward regulator is somewhat adjustable,
but even the stock regulator is variable based on manifold
pressure.  Otherwise, a stock 944T would have 2.5 bar fuel
pressure even at idle.

I was told someone had a race seat for sale for a 944 (~$250).  If it's
still for sale, please let me know.  I'm also looking for a window net.

Thanks in advance.
