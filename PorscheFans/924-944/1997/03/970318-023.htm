hey all,

I'm getting ready to replace my oil cooler seals, cam/balance shaft seals,
radiator, thermostat, and brake rotors and pads... blah blah

+ + +

I need to know what are the odd tools that help in this job...

I have a 3/8" socket and a 3/8" torque wrench... will I need a 1/2" of
either for anything?

also, any notes on odd pliers, extension bars, breaker bars, those
universal joints for the socket, allen head sockets, star sockets, anything
else strange appreciated...

yeah, luxurious and expensive, but I'll probably order the tensioner
spreader tool ($18) and balance shaft holder ($45) from Automotion, since
I'll be doing the belts from now on... any opinion on these tools?

anybody know of a good source for the belt tensioning tool? Automotion has
one for $550, but I know it can be cheaper than that...

Sears had a few snap ring pliers, any of these suitable for the thermostat
snap-ring?

+ + +

thanks in advance, I'm trying to have as much stuff ready as I can going
into this job so I won't have to suffer as many delays...

+ + +
