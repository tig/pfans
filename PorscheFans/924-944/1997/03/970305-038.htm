Subject: 1987 951 - Delete sunroof?

I just bought a 1987 951 US car with no sunroof.  It also has LSD,
trans cooler, Sport susp, sport seats, and I think a smaller diameter
steering wheel (with airbags) though the steering wheel size item may
be my imagination.  It does have A/C , a radio, all the usual power
options and dual-power seats in p-cloth.

Was there a "delete sunroof" option available in 1987?

Was there some option pack that included all this stuff?

I must say I am happy to have it.  The former owner thought
it was some "stripped down" model!

The only other cars I have seen liek this (turbo-no SR) were


**End of virtual snip **

I also have a 87 951 with no sunroof but with LSD, ABS, rear wiper, power 
door locks, factory alarm,  drivers sport seat, 928-style flat 
wheels, etc.

I had to order the car from the factory like this as the dealer told me 
I'd never be able to sell the car without a sunroof- thats why they never 
ordered one that way for sales from stock.

I ordered mine that way because I thought it might be lighter, would 
increase headroom (I'm over 6') and wanted to put my money where it 
mattered (like ABS, wheels, etc).

BTW I picked mine up at the factory and mine was the only 951 or 944 
there with no sunroof in the delivery salon.
