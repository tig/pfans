Hi, Arif,

Well, whoever did this waterpump replacement did not have the factory 
manual and/or did not understand how the balance shafts are timed.

Suffice it to say, either one of two things has happened:

1) One of the balance shaft sprockets is not properly aligned to its
balance shaft. The upper one must use the keyway marked O (for Ober);
the lower one must use the keyway marked U (for Uber).

2) The balance shaft belt is mis-timed in relation to TDC of #1 cylinder.

If they won't fix it, you need to find yourself another shop, and my 
guess is that they didn't have the belt tension gauge in the first place,
so you should take it to another shop to have it fixed anyway...


Good Luck!
