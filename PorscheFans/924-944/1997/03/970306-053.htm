I lost the keys for the glove box and the alarm on my '84 944. Asking a
locksmith to do a house call is pricey so I dismantled both locking
mechanisms and took them to a locksmith -- took about $15 to get keys made
for both.

The alarm key is basically a switch. Take the vent grille on the driver's
side inside qtr panel off, and also carefully pry up the plastic black
thingy around the alarm key hole. Be careful with the paint and with the
plastic itself - it is easy to crack. Next reach inside the vent hole
(minus the plastic grille now) and hold the alarm assembly while you
unscrew the nut on the outside of the key hole (under the black plastic
thingy). Once you have the nut off the switch slides into the qtr panel
and out of the vent hole. Now you can unplug it and take the switch to the
locksmith. Be careful with the leads -- if you short them the alarm will
go off and I couldn't make it go off even after I almost tore the little
plugs off -- had to pull a fuse.
