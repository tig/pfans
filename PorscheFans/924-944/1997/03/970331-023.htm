I don't remember who the original sender of the message was, but about a
month ago someone asked for a Blaupunkt radio manual.  I'm not sure if I
found what this person was was looking for, but I just discovered my manual
for the Monterey SQR 23 (was this the model in question?).  The stereo
(which I also kept after replacing it with an Alpine) came with my '86 951,
and the manual is in good shape.  The front/back cover is of course a little
wrinkled and dirtier than the rest of the pages, but all of the pages
between it are perfectly clean and wrinkle-free.  No yellowing of the pages
either.
        If this is the correct manual, and that individual or anyone else is
still interested in obtaining it, let me know.  It also came with a
"Blaupunkt Radio Service" fold-up chart that appears to describe all of the
centers qualified to service Blaupunkt products around the globe.
        I also have a piece of paper titled:  "Die Deutsche Bundespost
informiert."  Anyone know what this thing is is?
