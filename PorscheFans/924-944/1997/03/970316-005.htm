Hello fellow listees:
Just put the car back on the ground after the clutch replacement, repack of all CV's and replacement on the shifter lever. Job went well and was easier than expected due to the quality of original engineering and fasteners. Didn't need a sledge hammer once!!
I'm doing several other projects to prepare the car for spring and in doing so I have a new batch of questions. 
1) I'm adding a rear wiper. The wiper and switch are installed and I need to know how the wiring runs in the C pillar. The wiring that came with the wiper is long enough to run up the side of the match and into the body. At that point it is difficult to see what is going on. Anybody know??
2) Can anybody recite the secrets of cooling system bleeding? If I remember someone said that raising up the front of the car helps.
3) Part of the cooling system that does not make any sense to me is the pressurized 'overflow' tank. From past experience with other designs it is a bad thing to have any air trapped in the pressurized system but there it is in the tank??

Resources that I can offer - I have replaced the stereo and all speakers - If anyone needs to know procedures or what will fit I can offer suggestions and dimensions. I found some different methods for transmission and torque tube work that may be of assistance to 85.5 and later 944 NA owners.

Spring is almost here and I want to go out and play.
Chris White
