Depends on the oil type you're using (of course).  20W50 gets you about
5/2 at 3K/idle, other oils will (of course) change those numbers.

Yeah, the Porsche manual says that for 10W30 oil, the pressure should stay
around 6 or 7 bar at 3K, 4 or 5 idling.  I'd suggest that at 100K miles,
you switch to a heavier oil; no real reason to (unless you're noticing
problems), but it lasts a little longer.  If you're as anal as some of the
people on this list and change your oil every 50 miles, you won't notice
it, but...

I don't think it's an oil pump.  Don't think it's anything.  If this is a
recent thing, someone who serviced the car probably put in heavier oil.
Your camshaft wear could have been due to hundreds of things, like a worn
clip or something.

I think you're just worrying overmuch, but if it really bothers you, by
all means ask someone who knows something about cars.  I just sponge off
the list and occasionally offer random 924 advice. ;p
