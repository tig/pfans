a fellow named Ron at Eurospeed (517) 645 5555 is working on something like
this using a SnapOn tensioner tool which he will calibrate using a Porsche
Gauge and a spare 944 he has been working on... our conversation leads me
to believe he will follow a procedure close to the one below...

he hopes to have something "in the next few weeks" and hopes to sell these
around $150...

>1) Modify another gauge (any suggestions?) so that it can accurately
>measure tension in the same manner as the porsche gauge. (i.e. has the
>same contact points on the engine and belt) Then, tension the belt
>through the full range of the porsche gauge, taking readings with the
>modified gauge at each step along the way. Then, create a table with
>interpolated values so that readings from the modified gauge can be
>interpreted in terms of porsche gauge units. We must make sure the
>modified gauge can cover the full tension range, and that the
>measurements are repeatable. Since the porsche gauge can be calibrated
>with a single piece of metal (a calibration standard from porsche) I
>would guess the gauge is fairly linear. Even if the porsche gauge isn't
>linear, and the modified gauge isn't linear, the above will work with
>enough sample points.
