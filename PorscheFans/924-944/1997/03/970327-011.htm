Gary Windham suggests we work on a Repair Guide.  I think this is a
great idea!  I have found the information in the FAQ's and on this group
to be very usefull additions to the Haynes and Factory Workshop Manuals.

Perhaps the best way to do this is as follows:

When a topic is not covered, or is not adequately covered in any of the
FAQ's, and someone has a need for advice (ie. sends a note to the
PorscheFans group), the requestor should compile all of the info they
receive from list members.  This same person can then post their
compiled findings in a well written format. List members can then send
any suggestions for revisions to the requestor.  When at a satisfactory
level of completion, the info could then be added to the FAQ.  Being
responsible for compiling information received would be a small price to
pay for the valuable advice received from other list members. In
addition, this would reduce the number of postings asking for the same
general advice as additional topics are covered in the FAQ.  

What do you all think of this?

Gary, when you have a site to place what you have collected to date, let
us all know, and maybe we can start the above?
