I too have had an airbag computer problem in my '87 951.  The airbag warning 
light does not go out after the prescribed 5 seconds once the car is started.

The trouble began several months ago when I took off the steering wheel  (I 
can't even remember why I took it off).  Anyway, I took the car to a Dealer.  I 
watched the tech carefully as he followed the diagnostic procedure.  The blink 
code indicated a bad crash sensor on the passenger side.  Funny thing was that 
the individual sensor electrical check (with an ohmeter) did not indicate a bad 
sensor.

Well, I got a new one anyway, which I had the dealer install.  When the tech 
tried to reset the computer, the warning light stayed on.  The tech made a 
photocopy of the manual section which covers the reset procedure.  One of the 
steps is to leave the car battery disconnected for 20 minutes prior to 
attempting the reset.  I have tried the procedure at home a few times, to no 
avail.  So far I've spent more than $200 on this problem.

I believe that the computer is "stuck" in some mode.  The tech said he has seen 
this in similar systems (e.g., Mercedes).  The "only" solution is to replace 
the fault computer.  A good used one can be had for $250-400, about half the 
price of a new unit.

I'm probably going to disconnect the computer just to get rid of the annoying 
warning light, until I decide what to do next.  I have a call into PCNA because 
I don't think I should have to buy a new computer for a problem like this... 
we'll see how far I get.

I am happy to send a FAX copy of the reset procedure to anyone who needs it.
