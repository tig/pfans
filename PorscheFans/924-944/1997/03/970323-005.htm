Gregor, esteemed colleagues,

Thanks for the reply.

So the late 944s definitely have two-speed fans. Is the same true
of the early cars? To me, both fans look to be running the same
speed, but it's hard to tell. One thing is for sure, you KNOW it
when the fans come on! You can hear it plainly from inside the
car, and from outside it's like an F-16 fly-by. If you're behind
the car when they engage, you get quite a blast of air.

Here are my questions regarding cooling fan operation on the
early cars:

1. Should the fans operate independently?

2. Is/are one/both fan(s) two-speed?

3. What exactly causes each fan to engage?

4. How do the early/late cars differ if at all?

In other words, does anyone really understand how this system
operates? I'm mainly just curious (as the car isn't overheating)
but I'm pretty sure that my cooling system isn't right. People
ask me "what's wrong with your car?" when the fans kick on. It
literally has made people jump as if frightened. This car is
supposed to be somewhat refined. I'm not out to impress with
my "ultra powerful cooling fans." Thanks for any info you can
provide.

P.S.  Still looking for any thermostat advice you can give.

THANKS!
