Mark:

It sounds like a vacuum leak or false unmetered air.  Check all your vacuum 
hoses.  With the motor running, spray some carburetor cleaner on hoses. 
 When your idle stabilizes for a moment, the spray has temporarily stopped 
the hole and you've found your leak.  Due to high underhood heat, hoses may 
become brittle or porous over time.

BTW, you don't need to remove the O2 sensor to test it.  Use a digital VOM 
and a pin to probe the wire in the pigtail.   It should read 0.2V cold and 
 should oscillate quickly from 0.1 to 0.9V after the engine heats up and 
goes closed loop.  If it's dead, it'll probably be stuck at 0.2V.  If it 
changes slowly, it's 'lazy' and should be replaced.

The idle on my '89 951 is jumping from 700RPM to 1100 RPM like someone
is pumping the accelerator.  This just recently started and I
understand that it could be a bad O2 sensor.  I also understand that
the O2 sensor is connected to the wiring harness at the back of the
intake manifold.  I was going to disconnect the sensor as a test but
there are two electrical connections held by a stalk mounted to the
rear of the engine.  Which one is the O2 sensor, the rearmost or the
one closer to the front of the car?  Also, if the problem is not the
O2 sensor what could it be?  Throttle sensor???

Thanks
Mark
'89 951
