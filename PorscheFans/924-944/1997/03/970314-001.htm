I checked my Snap-On catalog and found a gauge listed for $113.00 (Snap-On
part number GA424A).  The gauge range is between 30 - 180 lbs. (130 - 800
N*m).

It would seem reasonable that you could "calibrate" this gauge to meet the
Porsche tension requirements using the method described by Ezra.  You only
need to calibrate reliably to the tensioning points required by Porsche.  I
would also be concerned that the repeatability is 100%

The only obstacle I can see is wether the Snap-On gauge will fit into the
space requirements.  If there is interference fit between the tool and the
engine you may not be able to make repeatable measurements.

I would be very interested in hearing the results!  The price difference
between 113 and 150 would be a worthwhile investment for his calibration
efforts.
