I weighed in with a lengthy diatribe about Cincinnati Microwave (Escort)
products several weeks ago after having to send my Solo detector back a month
after I bought it because of malfunctioning.  As a followup, they sent it
back to me by return mail with a letter saying that it had checked out fine
and just had low batteries.  This surprised me, since I had only had it a
month and had not driven more than normal (about 1000 miles, mainly highway).
 The batteries are supposed to last 2-3 months.  The upshot is that the funny
beeps I was getting were a low battery warning.  I had used the batteries
which come with the detector.  They sent 4 new batteries.  I installed 2 and
the detector has been superb since then, much better than any of the 4 or 5 I
have owned previously.  The best part is much less falsing and no power cord!
 So I am a fan of Escort once again, at least until the next service issue.
