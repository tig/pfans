There have been revisions on the water pump, to my (limited) knowledge
at least two major ones. When changing the old pump for one of these
newer units it may be necessary to modify it and this is covered in tech
notes from the factory. (But if those guys have *them* is hard to tell -
I'll guess not - see below)

A possible mistake, and a easy one to make, is to not understand how the
balance shafts should be aligned and make a mess out of that. A slight
misalignment will tell - a big one will tell even more. Why give these
guys a second chance to really foul things up?
