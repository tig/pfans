Believe it.....hate to rehash this but I sold an 89Turbo for 13.5 and a friend 
bought an 88 TurboS with 45K on it in mint cond. for 11.8K from a Chevy 
dealer. All within the last 2 months in car saturated California.  Both new 
owners are very happy.  Maintenance can be expensive if you have a shop do all 
the work.  That and the fact that to the non cognosenti, they look like an 83 
944 is why they're so cheap!!  You will see some pretty high asking prices but 
remember, these aren't SELLING prices.........and they'll outperform cars 
costing 3-4times as much....Ted, (climbing down from the soapbox.....)

Hah, looks like you bought one of those "excellent" condition cars that
Excellence says you can buy for under $15K :-)  Don't believe it!
