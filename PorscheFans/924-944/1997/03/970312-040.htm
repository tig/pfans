first, THANK YOU to: Ross Stites, Clark Archer, Douglas Holtsinger and
others...

last week I inquired about the quality of the "official" manuals, and
included a description of the problems with my 1987 944 and the situation
in general... I got lots of good advice and I'm preparing to move ahead
with trying this repair myself...

+ + +

I'm going to replace the cam/balance seals and belts, and the oil cooler
seals... I'm also probably going to install a new waterpump and radiator...
I will replace the cam cover gasket and head gasket... I will also replace
the thermostat...

this is a quick list, and there may be some additions as I examine the
process more carefully, but it's general enough to help me start ordering
things... does it seem like I'm missing anything major?

+ + +

the water pump is fine and the radiator is fine (except the threads where
the plug goes in is stripped- I have it in with hi-temp silicone)... I was
going to replace the water pump "while I was down there" and the radiator
has a stripped drain plug... I figure the radiator is filled with yucky
stuff anyway, and the pump has been pumping yucky stuff for a couple of
months...

faulty logic in replacing these two parts (especially the water pump-
should I leave it alone?)? I'm as fine as I can be with the $600 cost of
these two parts... I want some peace of mind...

+ + +

any opinion on thermostats that open earlier, turn the fans on sooner and
leave them on longer? it gets plenty hot here in Atlanta, Georgia duriong
the summer...

+ + +

I'm ordering parts right now... does anybody know of any bizzare tools
which I may need or would help certain procedures?

+ + +

I'm looking for sources on the infamous tensioning tool... Automotion has
one for $550 (steep) and EuroSpeed maybe able to fashion one out of a
SnapOn tool for $130, but it sounds pretty deviant from a standard tool...
anybody know of a good buy on a preferably new tension mechanism, lemme
know!

+ + +

as for the thermostat, the 944 FAQ says: "Ron Olsen has suggested a
particular tool:  SnapOn PR5645A Snap Ring Pliers (45 degree with .09
tips).  It runs approximately $20.

Automotion also carries 90 degree snap ring pliers (around $45). However,
in my experience the length of the pliers is too short to do the job (they
will not reach the ring once it is in place)."

does this sound accurate? how do you order SnapOn, from a parts place?

+ + +

do I need any of these strange tools?

Automotion tool TL-1210 (pg 180 new cat) looks like it does photo 8.12a/b
on page 58 of Haynes... essential or just nice?

Automotion TL-8640 (pg 180 new cat) looks useful enough... true?

Automotion TL-0850 (pg 180 new cat) claims to assist alignment of the "oil
pressure relief galley" is this thing needed?

+ + +

I'll be posting more later, but I wanted to get this part out... next I'll
plan as best I can the sequence I will follow and see what situations I
encounter at those new junctions...

thanks in advance

+ + +
