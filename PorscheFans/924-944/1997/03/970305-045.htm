I got a steal from PartsHeaven.  I was looking around for a couple of 
months because mine was cracked really badly.  I got out Pano one day 
and called every parts house and got lucky.  Leather dash complete for 
$595.  It was black so I got the name of the guy who does the 
dealerships color matching and paid him $100 to spray it dark blue.  I 
installed it myself.  It was pretty easy to install, just make sure 
that you unplug the battery and ground yourself to discharge any 
static electricity before unplugging the airbags.  I would make a week 
out of the project and spend some time once you get the old dash out 
checking all the vent and heater components.  Also plan on dropping 
$50 or so for new trim as the old stuff gets really brittle and will 
break easily when removing the old dash.

Hope this helps!

Good Advice Mark,
I think these cars all require constant influxes of cash. I bought my 
88
951 last summer for 12,500 with 44k miles and a complete history. Now 
I
figure I probably paid a thousand too much. Since the PO had done a 
water
pump clutch etc. in the last year or two I thought I would be fine. 
However
I have spent $700 on A/C $550 on a DME problem and now need to spend
another $600 on a water pump. I think that no matter how good a 
condition
the car is in, you can expect to spend a couple three grand the first 
year.
I beginning to suspect that every year will be that way. You know, an
endless cycle of water pump, radiator, oil cooler, CV joints, clutch,
steering pump, rack, A-arms, shocks, transmission overhauls. Makes it 
hard
to squeeze in an occasion upgrade. ;-( HOWEVER, these are such 
bargains
from a performance standpoint that the regular and expensive 
maintenance is
probably reasonable. ;-)
MC
PS Tell me about your new dash. Mine is cracked horribly and I would 
like
to replace it.
