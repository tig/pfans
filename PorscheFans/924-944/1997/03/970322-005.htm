I found

Neil,   

Depending on whether or not you do the water pump at the same time,
I would normally charge for about ten hours of labor for this job.   I guess
there are shops that could do it faster, but there are a lot of things to do,
and all of them take time.   There are seals and O rings on the cam, balance
shafts and crankshaft, and the entire timing mechanism has to be removed 
to get to them.   

Oil on the belts, especially the timing belt, is bad.   A soaked belt will
have a relatively short life, though I have seen some that looke like
they lived INSIDE the engine yet were still functioning.    I think the
important issue is that once the seals start to leak they will not stop.
I usually find all of the seals either bad, or on the verge of leaking.   
Even if you investigated and found that the belt was not contaminated,
you should still have the job done, as more serious leaks are just 
around the corner.

Figure in the neighborhood of a hundred dollars for a seal kit, another
25-75 for belts, plus the labor above.   The cost can still vary a lot,
depending on your location.   Labor is 50-100 per hour, and parts could
be double of what I just quoted.


>Also, any suggestions on spark plugs for a Calif. 87 944?? Time to change them 
>soon. I'm using the stock WR7DC's that Porsche recommends, but is there
anything 
>better ??

For MY money, all they do is light the fire.   If they don't do that, something 
else is wrong.   A healthy Porsche ignition system does just fine on stock
plugs.

Best of luck.

Dave
