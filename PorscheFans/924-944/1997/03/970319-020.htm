Everyone enjoys a little speculation: it keeps the list interesting.

I can't answer your question regarding 968's v. 911's, but I have an 87 951
with a chip and I run solo in drivers' ed at Sebring. Generally, my car is
faster than all 911's (except later 930's) up to the '95 993, and it is just
a little slower than that one. The 951S is a little faster than my car, and
appears to be equal with the 993's. Sebring is a pretty good test in that it
has a section that favors handling and it has some long straights. 951's do
well in the tight section and *love* long straights.
