DAVID, and all

Works pretty well from a audio point of wiew.

First, check the price on a replacement mat, before you cut any holes
into the one you have - it is expensive. Another problem is that the
speaker is vulnerable for moving objects that you may have in the
luggage compartment - so dont go this way if you plan to use the luggage
area a lot...  

In my 85.6 944 there was a (unsufficient) strenghtening for speaker
mounting in the mat, wich I complemented with a 1/2" chipwood filler,
formed exactly after the cavity. You may want to use a sabre saw for
this - it will take some time otherwise. It's ok to sandwich the mat
between the backup baffle and the loudspeaker - the screws will hold it
together.   It may be a benefit soundwise, if you stuff the cavitys with
some soft odds and ends, they are a little too big for the average car
audio speaker. Try to get as air tight as possible in the edge between
mat and fender. 

I was forced to go this way - speakers was installed and hence, the mat
was destroyed in my car. I would have preferred to build two speaker
enclosures and put on top of the cavitys instead.
