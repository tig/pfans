Hello everyone, I'm new to this list and thought I'd let myself be
known..I'm a 22yr old kid who loves cars (as you can see by my signature
below).  My latest addition is my '83 944 and I must say it is sooo much
fun; I love it! I got it in need of some TLC for next to nothing and am
now fixing it up. The driver side was hit and needs a new door and
fender (on their way). Here are my questions so far (I'm new to
Porsche's so bear with me):

1.When I depress the clutch I hear a loud rattling sound down by where
my feet are. The clutch hooks to the engine, then goes to the tranny in
back right? Does this sound like a clutch problem? Can the average guy
fix one in his garage?
2.There was no radio and I'm not getting any power from the hot leads
where the radio goes. I checked the fuses under the driver side dash and
all look okay (those are funny looking fuses). ANy other fuses maybe I
dont know about?
3.I currently have 225/60/15's on it and it looks funny (too high off
the ground). What are the stock tire sizes? Do they make lowering
springs? Does anyone recommend them/discourage them?
4. MOST IMPORTANT!!!!! What can I do to get more power? My Fiero, Stang
and bike all blow it away, but none match the handling.....
I appreciate any info....thanks....
