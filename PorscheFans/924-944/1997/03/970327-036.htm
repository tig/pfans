$400 for this? well, at least it is fairly heavy for it's size...

+ + +

some quick questions, as I'm still awaiting shop manuals and this thing has
not one piece of paper even mentioning its intended use...

1. is there anything I can do to screw it up royal?  there are screws and
dials all over the place... can I mess 'em up? no instructions, no
warranty? actually, it came in a box with a Porsche sticker on it, do I get
a two year warranty?

2. how do you set "zero" with it? of course the main dial rotates, so that
seems screwy for a gauge and all...

3. what is the purpose of the rotating dial in the center of the gauge that
rotates the stationary hand?

4. is it usefull for anything else? testing fresh baked muffins for
doneness? measuring the spring in my step- can I tell if I'm going to have
a good day?

5. yes, I got Porsche part 920 1/2... some kind of tensioning calibration
band... hints?

thanks...
