This is something that's been frustrating me for a couple of weeks.
Basically, my '79 924 tends to slide on fair-to-moderate corners.  From
everything I can tell, I'm not doing anything wrong -- no braking through
the corner, keeping even acceleration until halfway through, starting and
ending wide and (trying) to hit the inside of the corner at the sharpest
point -- but the damn tail of the car keeps sliding on me.  I've already
been in two situations where I almost went into a guardrail.  (One of them
was my fault, I hadn't put the spare tire and stuff in the back, so it was
about forty pounds lighter than the front, but the other was with the
factory weight distribution -- from what I can tell.)

I've tried fairly elementary stuff, like checking the tire pressure and
varying it a little to see how it affects handling, but it still hasn't
fixed the problem.  On review of the scene, I couldn't spot any gravel or
oil or anything.  This is just for street driving, so I can't expect
perfectly-banked corners, but still...

Is there any particular element of my suspension that could be causing
this, or have I just reached the limits of what my car can do?  I realize
there are a lot of factors, and I don't expect a magic cure-all, but short
of redoing my entire suspension, how can I prevent this from happening?
