Ladies and Gents, a couple of "low-end mechanic" questions on my '83 944
(108K, no mods, daily driver):

o       Car seems to have good steering responsiveness BUT doesn't hold
direction well when driven over bumps or seams in the highway. Wants to
take off for the "wild blue yonder" particularly when the seam is in the
same direction as the car is travelling. Alignment? Shocks?

o       Am going to replace the shocks on this car as I have no idea when
it was done last. OEM OK or should I go for the expensive ones? Plan to do
the work myself... recommendations?

o       Have a couple of dash gauges which appear flaky... as well as a
fuel gauge illumination light which works one day, doesn't the next.
Suspect wiring problems (ground). Is it tough to get to the gauges and
wiring harness behind the dash?

o       Need new tires this spring. Recommendations? I normally put
1000mi/month on this car in all kinds of traffic and weather.

o       Carpeting is worn. Noted Tweeks' has a replacement carpet kit for
the 944. Anyone have any experience? Good value?

o       Clutch will have to be replaced soon. Understand this is a tough
job... but can it be done in the garage with the car on jackstands or does
it have to be done on a full lift? Any special tools?

I have another car to drive while I'm working on this so I expect to do it
a stage at a time, in an orderly manner. I can afford the time to learn!
Please note I am neither building a racer nor a concours car... just want a
pleasant day to day driver. I am not a great/professional mechanic but I
can always fall back on my son, who is both ... but I have to endure his
smirking!

Thanks in advance
