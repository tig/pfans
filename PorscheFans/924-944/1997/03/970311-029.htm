I'd like to add my couple of cents to this thread...

Although I'm relatively inexperienced in this area, I'd like to make some
deductions.  Please make any remarks on the below.

Head gaskets probably blow because of running too lean of a mixture at high
boost levels, and advancing the timing.  This causes pre-detonation, or a
detonation while the piston is still traveling up the cylinder (while it is
compressing the fuel/air mixture).  The energy doesn't really have anywhere to
go, and it probably won't be able to press the piston back down the way it came
due to the momentum of the engine, so it transfers into heat (or breaks the
piston).  Depending on the conditions, we are talking lots of heat.

It's this heat that burns out the headgasket, or fuses the engine together, or
breaks pistons and cylinders. Or warps the head...

In order to prevent the gasket from going out, we can switch to a different
material gasket.  We can also change the torque ratings of the head bolts,
however since they are already really high, I doubt that's going to alleviate
the head gasket problem.

Either way, your still faced with the problem of seizing you engine, or blowing
your engine up.

There is also the issue of the compressability of the fuel air mixture, I'm
assuming (ah, that word again) if we get too much fuel and air, we are causing
enough heat by compressing, that the mixture ignites by itself.  Then we have a
diesel engine, running on gasoline.  However I doubt this comes up because of
the factory's lemans cars, which had something like 500hp.

Now if we get an adjustable boost knob, we can add more boost, and create more
power providing we get enough fuel.  However, I really don't think any of us
really knows how the computers react to increased boost.  I'm assuming a
non-linear function is used to determine the correct mixture.  For factory
chips, we can be assured this function works up to .75 or .8 bar.  Anymore
boost than that, who knows, the chips might not be able to compensate the
mixture properly.

Supposedly aftermarket chips can compensate for the increased boost.  I don't
know how well.  We are getting to the point where we are limitted by our fuel
pressure regulators and our fuel injectors.

So to wrap things up, we can probably have quite a bit of boost in our cars
without worring about blowing the head off the block.  The only problem is
timing and fuel delivery.  I don't remember what boost the le mans cars ran.
 Nor do I know the compression ratio they used either.  However they were
getting upwards toward 500hp.  During the late 80's people were campaigning the
944 turbos on the SCCA circuits.  I think someone (I don't remember the name)
had one that produced ~600hp.

I haven't really solved anything, just thought I'd give my deductions on this
subject.

Any opinions on the above?
