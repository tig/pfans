Hello All

I wanted to relate my experience with installing the Bosch Adjustable
Fuel Regulator on my '88 951, and ask if anyone has done this and/or any
opinions etc.  It's supposed to give you increased HP under hard
acceleration by increasing the fuel pressure proportionally.

After installation, in order to adjust the pressure you need a fuel
pressure gauge.  I purchased one of these from a JC-Whitney Catalog for
about $50.

I installed the pressure regulator and attached the gauge to the Fuel
Distributor.  My Haynes Manual states that fuel pressure at idle should
be at 29psi.  The instructions on the Adjustable Fuel Regulator say that
you can set it 4-6psi higher ( it has a bolt that you turn to adjust the
fuel pressure ).  I now have the pressure set at 35psi. ( and this was on
a cold engine )  Does that sound too high?

I've been driving around for a couple of days with it on there, and I
definitely notice more pickup when I floor it.  The engine even sounds a
little different.  The instructions say that you are also supposed to see
better acceleration right of idle.  This, I'm not experiencing.

Thanks for any feedback.

'88 951 - Soon to probably be set on fire during one of my mechanical
escapades.
