They are a must for any serious work on your car.  They're well written
and explain things well.  The only disadvantages are the price, and
they do assume you're a mechanic.

Agreed.  If you're going to tackle this job, invest in the manuals.  These 
all fit in the 'take it to your dealer' category in the Haynes manual
anyways, don't they.

You're not over your head if you are prepared to take your time with
this and ask questions.  If the car can sit until finished is the big
problem.  If you've got other transportation while it takes up garage
space, you're in good shape.  When you aren't sure what to do, ask 
questions.  That's what this list is for!

You can get a front seal kit to take care of most of these.  I've never worked
on a non-turbo, so I don't know what's involved with the oil cooler.
You might as well replace the camshaft cover gasket if it's leaking at
the same time.

Why replace the whole radiator, for a stripped plug?  Surely you can
find another plug!

They aren't that bad.  They just take time.  Replacing everything else won't
help since it all has to be back together before you start on the belts.
Replacing the rollers along with the front oil seals and belts is a logical
thing to do.  Don't even consider starting this until you've got a 
tensioning tool in hand!

If you really want to work on it, I'd say go ahead and start now.  Whenever
you start, it's going to be the same predicament.  The sooner you start,
the sooner the savings from skipping the mechanic will start.  The first
time to do most jobs seems to cost me the same as taking it to the 
mechanic.  It's the second, third, etc. times that my investment pays
off.

Like I said above, this list contains a lot of expertise.  Use it.  I doubt
the 'shop helper' idea would work.  Your time would probably be better spent
working on your car.  Btw, are you a PCA member.  You can probably find 
someone in your local region that has experience working on their car that
could give you some tips too.  That way if you do get stuck, he/she may
be able to stop by and give things a look...

You can do a lot of fixing for that much money.  Especially after you add
in tags, taxes, and insurance.  Plus everything you spend on that car will
be money you can't spend on your current car.

Only if you need another car to drive around while you work on your
Porsche:)
