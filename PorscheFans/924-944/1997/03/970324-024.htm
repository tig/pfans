he's also the fellow working on the SnapOn modified tension gauge, though
he may a reminder or two from the gallery... I ordered a Behr radiator from
him recently... he has returned all of my calls (once around 8pm my time,
which was 7pm his time), and most important, when I do get him on the
phone, he's ready to talk Porsche... that can't be said for a lot of other
places who don't want to talk about anything, they just want a
billing/shipping address... I give him the thumbs-up...

see: http://www.mindspring.com/~design/thefuture/parts

this site is under construction... I started last week... if anyone wants
to contribute a review... e-mail me at:

design@mindspring.com

I don't just take, so I'm building this website to detail the shadetree
work and resources I used for my 1987 944...

thank you... I will officially "launch" the site in a couple of weeks...
but I'll take reviews and photos now...


thanks...
