	Yep.

	As I said, this, I think is the problem. Hopefully, an engine
	backflush will take care of this.

	Maybe. See above. Though, those oil cooler seals were the
	original ones. The car had 94K on it at the time so it
	wouldn't have been that unusual for them to go bad...

	!!! I'm not even going to consider this one right now :) Not
	that it couldn't happen, but I just don't feel in the mood
	for a good cry today :(

	Don't think so. The replacement water pump was a new one
	bought direct from Porsche and is the proper spec for my
	car.

	Well, I'll keep everyone informed. Thanks, Matt!
