I outlined a few easily identifiable spots in a previous post.

These are difficult to copy but quick to identify.

I was under the impression he wanted something he could do AT the dealer.

If this is repetetive please ignore.

1) 928S4 style brakes.  If the front brake caliper is significantly larger
than the rear, it has TurboS style brakes.  That's an expensive upgrade
generally only done on SERIUOS track cars.  The calipers list for $500 each.
A nrmal turbo has calipers that are outwardly identical front to rear.
If (2) is in place, this is easy to spot.

2) Forged 7-spoke wheels.  These are NOT the same as design 90 wheels.
Design 90 wheels are 7-spoke CAST wheels, and have a lip that runs all the way
around about 1" from the outside edge of the wheel.  The forged wheels look similar but you can take your fiunger and run it from the wheel center all the way to the edge of the rim without encountering a lip of any sort, except for the last 1/8" or so.  Also - design 90 wheels are painted silver with clear coat, whereas forged "S" wheels are annodized aluminum.  These wheels coast about $1500 used and are rarely  found on anything but turboS

If you look carefully at
"http://warthog.us.udel.edu:80/porsches/boris951.gif" you will see a
set of DESIGN 90 wheels that have been polished to look like forged.
You will see a definate line where the spokes attach to the wheel rim -
the ataachement point is inset about 1/2" inch whereas on the forged
theel the spoke-to-rim atachremnt is flush.

3) If you can get a look at the front struts, you will see that the
lower perch is machined aluminum pair of adjusters, which reside on a
threaded sleeve which slides over the strut.  The struts should be
yellow in color.  If the lower spring perch is a welded sheet metal
affair, the car is not an "S".

4) The inner door pannel should not have the storage area int he lower
armrest. This should be a flush panel filled with spearkers.  I'm not
convinced this is limited to "S" models - there mauy have been an
option.

I believe those are the best outwardly visible clues to make the first
cut.  If any of them are off...the car is not an "S".  If thy are all
there, then the car is worth investigating further.  At that point it
would be worth calling PCNA.

My opinion.  Those are the cues I would use...and those suspension
parts I updated on my '86 to make it trackable....but I never
represented it as an "S" I have never seen the "S" script on the rear.
That's flat out wrong.

I do not understand why people post things that they "think" are right,
when there is almost always someone on line who KNOWS what's right.
