For some reason I found myself reading the 928 list and found this strange
bit of info about cruise control. Apparently the consensus there is that a
major reason for failure of the cruise brain is the brand of tail-lamp
bulb you use! The OEM German bulbs are supposed to have a precise
impedance, and when you are driving on cruise and tap the brakes to
disengage cruise, the cruise brain gets a jolt of juice through those
brake-light bulbs. And if they happen to be cheap and American, the Nazi
cruise brain doesn't like it and quits. The 928freak solution: to use the
thorough-bred bulbs, or to use the stalk-control off switch instead of
tapping the brakes. Now there's a stretch of ingenuity (imagination?)! And
the 928 way to fix the cruise brain is to solder _all_ the terminals in
the brain again. I'd estimate about 300 man-hours and 30 burnt fingers...!

And now the questions for the week: I've been trying to figure out the
exact purpose and functionality of the O2 sensor and am still at a loss. I
know roughly what it is supposed to do -- measure oxygen and tell the DME
to mix air accordingly -- what I don't understand is why it would measure
Oxygen _after_ combustion. And what does the DME do when the sensor is
disconnected/bad. Dave Cooley said something about a limp-home rich mode
-- exactly how does the DME substitute for it. And what about the myth
that a 944 runs meaner (not leaner) without an O2 sensor?

1. What does the O2 sensor do, what modes of operation does it affect
(emissions/cold starts/idle?), and what does the car do with a
bad/disconnected O2 sensor?

2. Read something about air getting in through the CO test pipe in the
engine compartment if it is not plugged, or if it has rusted off and
broken. Can't find this pipe -- can somebody let me know where to look in
the early 944?
