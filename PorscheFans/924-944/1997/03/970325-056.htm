I think that by some coincidence that your sunroof gear cracked when moving
the car.  Mine has engaged on several different occasions.  This happened
mostly due to tinkering with the air deflector with the roof out.  The gears
are quite fragile.  I even found a broken one under my seat where the
previous owner had replaced it.  I don't see any possible way that the
latches attempting to engage  without the roof in place could damage the
mechanism.
