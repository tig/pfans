I use AMSOIL Series 2000 20W50 Synthetic.  I change my oil every 10,000
miles.  The oil does not coke up my turbo, and the engine runs cooler. 
The oil also maintains its friction inhibiting properties at higher
engine temperatures, which helps my turbo last longer.  I've noticed
that since the switch from regular oil to AMSOIL synthetic that my turbo
spins up a lot faster (more initial kick).   I'm not just saying all
this because I'm an AMSOIL dealer, I'm sure a few of you have tried this
stuff with some positive feedback.

My little Rabbit diesel has 20,000 miles on its lube, another 5,000
miles until oil change.  The cam is clean, no varnish deposits, and if
you take off the oil filler cap snd smell the engine, you will not smell
the pollution that conventional oil makes.  It smells clean, really! 
Synthetic, as many of you know, does not build up acids and
contaminents.  And the AMSOIL oil filter I use blocks 8 micron
particles, while FRAM filters and MANN's block 20 micron particles.  

Cheers,

Wyatt
