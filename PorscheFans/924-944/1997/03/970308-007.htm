Yes.  You own one.  A '951' is the designation for a 944 Turbo.  A '931'
is a 924 Turbo.

It is a spiral wound gel cell.  The battery has 800 Cold Cranking Amps =
and
a 120 min reserve capacity.  It doesn't look like your normal ugly =
battery
as it has a molded gray plastic case divided into what look like 6 big
round cell areas.  The top is red plastic.

The Optima has two sets of terminals, the normal top mounted and also a
set of side mounted.  You can use either one, both, or combination of the
two.  It weighs just as much or more as a normal battery.

The main advantages of the Optima are its power capacity for normal auto
use and the fact that it is TOTALLY sealed and you never have to (or can)
add water.  It can be installed in ANY position, even upside down, and it
won't leak.  No leaks, means no corrosion.  It also has a very low
internal resistance and that gives it a very quick re-charge cycle.  The
Optima has a 72 month warranty with a two year full replacement if it
fails.

There are other batteries out there that claim to be better, such as the
Stinger.  The Stinger is designed for deep cycle use where it can be =
fully
discharged to 0 V again and again without damage.  If you have a big
stereo system and run it a lot with the engine off, the Stinger will
probably be better.  I think it is also quite a bit more expensive, in =
the
$160 range or higher.  Stinger does make more than one size and I've seen
a small one with 800 CCA that is smaller than the Optima.
