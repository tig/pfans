Did your mechanic agree that these inner seals are
sometimes missing, and that when missing can cause a
warmer running tempruture of 5 to 10 degrees.
I just appears that alot of people start having problems
when thermostats or waterpumps are replaced.

Mine started in OCT 95, I had the turbo thermostat,
Coolant and the Thottle position sensor replaced.
Before that the temp never rose above 80 degree cent.
Then witin 300 miles I started having erractic temps
and started attacking the problem.

I know that they started to come out with 83 degree
thermostats, instead of the 80 degree, to allow
the cars to run warmer. I guess they feel that is
being more environmental aware.

I believe I read in excellence, that the 4 vales engines (968's)
are most fuel burning efficient at 193 degrees, which is at 90
degree centrigrade. which is right in the middle of our normal
range on a 944's tempruture gauge. have they also changed the
turbo thermostats or waterpumps to cause a engines to run warmer?

thanks for your reply
