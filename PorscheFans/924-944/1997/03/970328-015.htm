Yes, the sunroof motor should stop when it hits the limit switch, either
the maximum or minimum excursion limit.

There are three micro switches associated with setting the limits for the
sunroof.  One is located inside the motor assembly (same side as the
plastic pie shaped cam).  That switch controls the fully extended limit
(sunroof up).  The other two are on the opposite side of the metal plate.
The one that is closest to the pivot point of the cam sets the latch arms
fully retracted (roof removal) position.  The third is sistered to the
second and is furthest away from the cam pivot point.  That switch controls
the roof locked down position.

There is also a fourth switch that sits in front of the sunroof and is
activated only when the roof is in place.  When the roof is removed, the
sunroof motor is deactivated by this switch.

I really think (my best educated guess) that the clutch is meant to save
the plastic gears in the event that the roof jams or something gets caught
between the roof and the sunroof.  It was not designed to keep running when
the latch arms reach their maximum excursions or when fully retracted.

If time permits, I will try to put together a complete workshop manual for
the sunroof and its operation.  I plan to do this using Microsoft Word
6.01, because this subject really needs illustrations to fully explain.
Also, there is a schematic associated with this system.  I will inform the
list when I get that ready for anyone that wants it.  For those that do not
Microsoft Word, you could send me a self addressed, stamped envelope that I
can mail you that manual upon completion.

In the mean time, I have three separate E-mail posts that anyone that want
I can send you.  They are text only and they are not well organized, but
contain a wealth of information that I have learned.

Post Script:

Due to the problems with the distribution of our list, it would be a good
idea to add your E-mail addresses to your signatures.  I can't always
respond to other members, because I have to use the archives on the Web to
get the list most of the time.
