	Dave, can't help much with the oil pan gasket cost (I'd fix
	it right away but that's just me) but something you said above
	set off alarm bells in my head. You need to keep the oil level
	at the full mark *all* the time in this car. I mean when it's
	warm, too. These cars are known to suffer from oil starvation
	problems. It's even more likely to happen when you have 1/3 of
	quart less then you should in the engine. Don't risk it! Which
	would you rather buy? A little more oil or a new engine. Keep
	that sucker full!
