Hey dudes,

Long time no write :)
I picked up a bumch of cool books that have been really enjoyable to
read.  They are factory Porsche books.  The first one is a 944 Turbo
DME and KRL manual.  It sort of explains the way it works and how
to test it.  They have a lot of the stuff we've discussed in the past
such as the high rpm idle, etc.  It gives solutions, etc. to common
problems and gives instructions on how to test the various sensors that
the DME uses.  It also comes with picture locations of the various
sensors.  Total cost was C$11.98

The next book and this is the one I really like is a 944 Turbo S
specification book.  It tells you all the differences between the
normal turbo and the "S" and 89+ models.  A couple of things that
really interested me were the turbocharger models and the turbocharger
boost pressure.  The "S" comes with a KKK K26-2670 GGA 8.11 and the
normal turbo comes with a KKK K26-2667 GGA 6.92  The last number seems
to represent the exhaust housing size which would mean that the
normal turbo has closer to a 7cm housing rather than a 6cm.  Does
anyone know how KKK models their numbers after?

The boost pressure according to this book is set to a max full load
of 1.82 bar absolute or 0.82 bar normal.  This equates to 12.0psi.
According to the book, this is 70mbar more than the normal turbo which
would put the normal turbo at 1.75 absolute or 0.75 normal which works
out to 11.0psi.  These are full load numbers taken at 3300rpm in third
gear.  These would be peak figures from what I can see.  In comparison,
my car does 17.5psi (1.2bar) peak and drops down to 14.5psi (0.98bar)
in the same test!  Paul's goes even higher to 19psi (1.29bar) and then
drops to ~13psi (~0.88bar).

The book also dispells the myth that the turbocharger vanes are different.
Nowhere did I see this, in fact this is what it says about the turbo:
"The engine is equipped witha turbine end modified turbocharger, a DME
control unit with different fuel and ignition curve families as well as
a knock and charge pressure (KLR) control unit modified to charge
pressure behaviour.  The charge pressure is 70mbar higher in full load
range (1.82bar absolute pressure)"

From what that reads, it's just the turbine side which is the exhaust
housing which is larger, that's all.

Did you know that the 6-small springs on the clutch are designed to allow
9 degrees of rotation on power and 12 degrees on coasting.  The four
big springs allow an additional 10 degrees of turning in both directions,
for a total of around 20 degrees both ways!

DId you also know that the standard adjustment for the front dampeners
is 3/4 turn to the left from full right lock, and the rear's are one
turn from the full left lock.

The third book I bought was the 944 Turbo/S2/S spec book which is
interesting, but only useful when I have to do something to the car.

Jay, your cooling problem is sounding more and more like a flaky
thermostat.  I can almost guarantee it's the thermostat.  Just
because they stuck a new one in doesn't mean that it's working or
that it is the temp range you like.  First, get yourself the 80C
thermostat and then have it swapped.  I can almost bet your current
thermostat is the 83C unit from the description you've given.  My
fans would be on all the time with the hotter thermostat too.  I'd
even get the loud, high speed motor kicking in when it got a bit warm.
Since I changed to the 80C unit, I've only had the high speed fan turn
on once and that was pulling off a highway after driving for 4 hours
straight and pulling into a parking lot and stopping.

Just to humour me, change the thermostat and look at the new unit yourself,
don't take anyone's word for it!

Farzaan.

Hi all,

I have a few questions that I'm sure this list has the answers.  After
developing a small coolant leak last week in my '86 944 (72k km), I bit the
bullet and took it in to have the water pump replaced.

The shop changed the following - water pump (new not rebuilt), timing and
balance shaft belt, and thermostat.  The guy said the rollers and tensioner
looked ok.

I got the car back this morning and now I have the following concerns.

1.  There is a high pitched whirring sound that increases with the engine
speed.  Is this normal with new belts and will it go away eventually ?

2.  There is now a slight vibration of the engine that was not there
before.  This vibration is there at all engine speeds.   Does this indicate
a problem with the balance shaft belt tension.

3.  The thermostat that was removed had 83 degrees stamped on it.  The new
one had 87.5 degrees on it.  Before now, the temperature gauge NEVER rose
above the first mark.  Now it settles at just below the second mark.
Considering that I don't drive in traffic often, and I live just 2 miles
from my office (the oil hardly has a chance to warm up), is it OK to use
this higher temperature thermostat.  What are the advantages /
disadvantages of this different thermostat.

I need some advice before I go back to the shop to complain.  Please e-mail
me directly because like everyone else, I have not been receiving the
digest regularly.

Thanks in Advance (TIA right?)
David.
