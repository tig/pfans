Hello PorscheFans,

This is my first post so please be patient with me.  I've just purchased an
85.5 944 with 80k original miles - totally immaculate.  The only problem is
the sunroof worked intermittantly but now it doesn't work at all.  The only
thing I could hear when I pressed the down button was a click from the
relay in the back - couldn't hear anything when I pressed the up button.

I bought a new switch and two new relays but that didn't work (i used to
restore MG's, I'm used to electrical problems).  Then I decided to make
sure the motor was operating properly so I used the two wires going to the
motor, grounded one and applied power to the other and the sunroof went up.
 Reverse the wires and the sunroof goes down - BUT the motor seems weak at
times.  Sometimes it wouldn't get all the way up or down - sometimes the
motor was very strong.  

Next I raised the sunroof, hooked all the wires back up and the switch
would close the sunroof perfectly but wouldn't raise it back up - like
power wasn't getting to the relays.  I noticed in the Haynes manual there
is a 3rd micro switch and I'm wondering if it's up by the lift assembly in
the headliner.

Anyway, at this point I'm ready to find a used motor assembly but if anyone
has any ideas I'd be happy to try them.

Thanks,

Michael Belfoure
