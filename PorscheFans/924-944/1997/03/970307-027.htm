A fellow PorscheFan remembered that a post around January 10 contained a
thread about the 968-style poiler I was interested in.  Since I joined the
list less than a month ago, I don't have access to that post.  If anyone
would be willing to look up and forward that thread for me, I'd greatly
appreciate it.

I also tried to buy Porsche crests for my phone dial center caps from
Automotion a few months ago.  But Automotion says that they no longer sell
them.  Does anyone know where or how I can get them?  The kind I'd like are
the crests that are supposed to be inserted in the 2 holes in my existing
center cap (not the ones that come already attached to a new set of caps).
Thanks for any and all help.
