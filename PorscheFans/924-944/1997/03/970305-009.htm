Thanks!  Yes, I have had them balanced and I had the dealer do an 
alignment.  I have no idea what the alignment settings are but will 
call the dealer and ask.  I would assume that if I have NTW balance 
the tire and then 4 weeks later I have the same place and same machine 
check the balance, an imbalance would mean that the tire is defective 
or the weights fell off?  I have heard that sometimes you just get a 
bad tire that wears wrong or has a defect that prevents it 
form"balancing".  Can your friend quantify how often NTW replaces 
Dunlop SP8000s as defective?

my friend works there and they are about the only tire he said he 
would put
on that car.  there are a milllion and one things that could cause it. 
have
you tried an alignment?? make sure the toe and camber are set 
corectly.
mine is set 2 deg. toe in and 3 deg -camber and at 65 it will shake 
you to death
however at 120+ it is rock solid.  have them balanced and if you still 
have the problem take it to a dealer!

----------
For the last several months I have had a dull rumble both in the seat 
and at the steering wheel.  The rumble seems to be worst in 2nd gear
at between 35 and 45MPH.  My clutch has rattling springs and I once
heard a suggestion that a bad clutch disk could cause this type of
vibration.

On the way home from the office tonight I had an opportunity to play a 
little.  At about 110MPH the steering wheel really started to shimmy
and at 120 I shut it down it was so bad.  I could not tell how much of 
the vibration was coming from the wheel and how much from the seat of 
the car but it was in both places.  The steering wheel shimmy was not 
severe in the distance from left to right but the force with which the 
wheel wanted to move was surprising.

The front tires are 225/50 16 SP8000s that are relatively new.  The
SP8000s replaced Pzeros.  With the Pzeros I had the car to 140 and I
do not recall it doing this but that was a while ago.  The rear tires 
are 245/45 16 P700s and were on the car when I bought it (they are
about to need replacing).  When they mounted the Dunlops they used the 
stick on weights as I did not want an unsightly piece of lead hanging 
on the outside of the rim.  I have been back to NTW once for
rebalances and three of the four tires need to be rebalanced (one rear 
was OK).

Has anyone had problems with Dunlops, specifically the SP8000?  I
suspect that the rear tires may be contributing to the problem but my 
gut tells me that I may have a bad pair of Dunlops.  NTW does have a
warranty of some sort but my faith that they will admit a tire is
faulty is nil.  I also need to replace the rear tires very soon and do 
not want to have the same problem.  I don't think it too much to ask
that there is some type of QC in tires that cost $200 each.  I do not 
track the car but am very particular about performance, especially in 
the rain, so I am less concerned about tread life.

Could I be looking in the wrong place?  What else might cause this
problem???

Thanks!
