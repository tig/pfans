Hello All,

I thought I might ask assistance from the list. 

A couple of days ago while driving my engine quit. No sputtering or warning.
It just quit. I had just shifted out of third at about 5000 RPM and shifted
to fourth when it happened. The engine turns over fine (no heartwrenching
sound of valves being crunched) but it won't even hint that it might start.
I did check to be sure that the camshaft belt was still in one piece...it is.

So far I've determined the following about the electrical system:
Working backwards.....Spark plugs have no fire (almost new
condition).....Cap and rotor are in good (almost new) condition and appear
to have no defects.....coil did not test for secondary resistance
specification.....replaced coil with new Bosch unit.....no change...voltage
to coil checks OK.

My next thought is the electronic control box. Does anyone know how to
determine if it is the culprit? I'm a little over an hour from a dealer and
have tried several local places for testing with no luck. Any other things
to check? Critical relays? Fuses? Wiring? Faulty alarm?

If sending return message to the list, please CC me at aclott@mci2000.com
because my digest subscription has been intermittant.

Thanks for the help

Alan Lott
