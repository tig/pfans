When I was looking for my 951S I came upon a turbo  S in Vancouver that
had a variable boost system in it. The car (black) had only 30,000 miles
on it but it had been blown up so I passed on it. I've since heard that
this car has been back on the market a few times so I suspect it does
very detrimental things to the engine.
