     Gentlemen,
     
        Having now rebuilt about four or five 944-951's, I am glad to say I 
     have never had to remove the crankshaft pulley.  I've only done 
     cylinder heads and timing/balance belts (rest of engine pretty well 
     bullet-proof) and even with the automatic tensioner you DO NOT need to 
     remove the crankshaft pulley.  
        When adjusting the tensioner to take the tension off the belt, I 
     used two 5 mm allen wrenches positioned in the holes in the tensioner 
     together with an aggro-bar as a lever to set the tensioner to a point 
     where the assembly will clear the pulleys but the tension is 
     sufficiently off the belt.  Aggro-bar needs to be 4 ft long to make 
     this easy...  Allen wrenches I used because they will bend rather than 
     snap when overloaded, steer away from rigid hardened pins for obvious 
     reasons. In all cases I have never bent an allen wrench...
        To remove/install the timing belt, practice (A LOT) with the old 
     belt to get it manouvered past the pulleys without twisting or 
     straining (and thus ruining) the belt.  Don't forget that the new one 
     will be slightly stiffer.
        
        These engines really are pretty basic (which makes them last so 
     well) so the home mechanic really shouldn't run into too many 
     problems.  Once all the air intake crap is moved out of the way there 
     is a remarkable amount of room in front of the motor to work.  The 
     tension on the timing belt IS crucial, but having used the gauge; the 
     tension is the same as Audi five cylinders, and most VW's.  I am not 
     endorsing doing the job without the tensioner; however I only used the 
     tool on one occasion...  ALL cars still run great, but then I've 
     rebuilt countless cylinder heads so I've seen and done a lot of these 
     rubber bands...
        
        DO re-check the tension on the timing belt after 2,500 miles, they 
     stretch and it's too easy to think: "Ah well there's no strange noises 
     coming from down there"  By the time you hear strange noises things 
     get expensive...
     
     Cheers,  Jan
