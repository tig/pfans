I just purchased a new Bel 845i.. very happy with it.  Replaced a 5 year
old X and K only Uniden RD-9XL.  This unit has a dot matrix LED text
display instead of just the little indicators.  In addition to the usual
radar and laser indications, it has the Safety Warning System with 60 or
so text messages, ranging from 'Emergency Vehicle in Transit' to 'High
Water ahead' or 'Construction Zone ahead.' It also cloaks to avoid VG-2
detector detectors, used in Canada and some US states, so the police don't
stop you and take away your detector, even if you aren't speeding. 

Check the major automotive magazines such as Automobile, Road and Track, 
etc. for their yearly ratings.

Escort has lost some of their exclusivity.. the current models seem to be
lower end now, and less expensive.  They seem to rate well, though.  The
Valentine is sickeningly expensive.. I would expect a dramatic performance
difference to justify buying it.  It is one of the top rated detectors,
however. 

I have a nifty way of connecting my detector, should anyone be interested. 
I hard-wired mine directly to the interior light between the sun visors. 
This dispenses with the annoying coily cord and lighter plug.  The ground
to the light is switched, so power is available at all times, even when
the light is off.  Even if you forget to turn your detector off.. no big
deal, as they draw virtually no power.  I forget to shut off mine on a
regular basis, and have never suffered a drained battery. 

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.
