The original question was how best to get POWER from a 944..actually it was
how much power could be gotten from a set of mods.

I dare anyone to tell me how to get an EXTRA 150 HP out of a normally
aspirated 944 for less than the difference in price from a 944 to 951
plus chips.

Nitrous doesn't count because it has to be replensihed, at significant cost, 
and has the side effect of going KABLOOIE!

For those who argue aginst the turbo due to high maintainance cost -
that cost is a DIRECT result of shoving power through those rod
bearings.  No matter how much power you make, it has to be transfered
to the crank...which is the same from 951 to 944, as are the rod
bearings.  Same holds for extra heat generated.

Edmonds shows the price gap from 944 to 951 at $2K.  Now add $200 for a 
set of used AutoThority chips.

Please tell me how best to get 287 HP from a normally aspirated 944 for
$2200 without SERIOUS reliability problems, and no turbo.  While you're at it 
make sure to include a brake upgrade.

I'd be willing to market that.
