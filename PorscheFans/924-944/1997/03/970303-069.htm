I recently (Three weeks ago), mailed this list for the first time for
some advice on my 924.  I was thrilled with the number of helpful
responses I received the next day, but my E-Mail crashed the next day
before I could write anyone back.  This problem was further compounded
by a suggestion I received from my local ISP -- re-apply for my E-Mail
account.  Only when I did, it erased my address book, and all of my
saved mail.  So, I can't reply to you directly, but you know who you
are.  To anyone who mailed a reply to my query about the Porsche
reflector on my 1979.

Travis Bowles
1979 Porsche 924, Two months older than its owner.
Feel free to mail me locally as well as on the list for parts and 924
