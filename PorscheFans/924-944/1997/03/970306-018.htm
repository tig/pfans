David,

The lock on the factory alarm is not complicated.  When I got my 951, it
also lacked the alarm key.  My mechanic gave me the number of an
experienced car locksmith who was nice enough to make a house call.  All
this guy needed to do was fit a blank in the keyhole, and based on that,
incredibly, he was able to cut a key within minutes.  That same key has
worked fine for years.  Maybe this was a special case, but the locksmith
said that he's done this with many other cars with factory alarms.  Any
competent locksmith should be able to cut you a key without having the
code.

Good luck,

Chris
'86 951
