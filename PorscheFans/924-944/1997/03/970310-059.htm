	Nick, I know you asked for advice from people who have
	done this and I am not one but, I'm gonna give it
	anyway :)

	Uhhh, maybe. I just put a set of Konis on my car and it
	was $1300. You might consider upping that figure somewhat
	but before you do...have you considered just buying a 944
	that's already set up for the track? Look in the back of
	Pano; you see *alot* of ads for track ready 944's that people
	are willing to sell fairly cheap. They'd most likely be
	in better shape this 944 seeing as how they were owned
	by people who really knew their stuff about 944s. That's
	the way I'd go if it were me. Just a thought...
