Could be any of a fairly large number of reasons. Easiest way to diagnose
 would be to take the car to a Les Schwab or other shop that has dealt
 with a 944 and ask for a front end suspension/steering diagnostic. At Les 
Schwab this is free, but you are unlikely to run into the most 
knowledgeable Porsche people; at a Porsche dealer this will run you 
about $70. If you do want to figure it out yourself jack the front up 
and waggle the wheels individually while somebody holds the other, and 
locate the source of the looseness. Here are a few possible sources: 
worn tie-rods (inner and/or outer ball-joints), bad wheel bearings, 
bad turnstyle bearings (whole strut+spring assembly will move), worn 
steering rack, loose steering column u-joints, skinny tires. I would 
not suspect alignment unless the car wanders on normal roads as well.

Depends on your requirements. OEM for your year was Boge/KYB and Bilsteins
 if you got the sport package. Most track-happy list members seem to love 
Konis, but personally I much prefer the Bilsteins. They have a multi-valve
 chamber and adjust to your driving/cornering speeds, unlike the Konis 
which want to give you back problems all the time. Of course I am assuming 
you are not planning to track your car. It is a 45 minute job max. but you
 will need to 4-way align afterwards. Would make sense to replace the 
turnstyle bearings while you are at it ($38) -- I am regretting not 
having done that.

Depends which gauges are flaky. If they are one of the main gauges (tach,
speedo) they are relatively simple to diagnose. If it is oil-pressure 
or water temp I would not mess with the gauges. To get behind the dash 
you need to remove the 2 screws on the underside of the top of the
cluster,
 remove the wheel (24mm socket), remove the plastic sleeves on the
ignition
switch (2 screws), and pull out the wiper/washer/blinkers/brights/cruise 
switch combo. The fuel gauge light is probably just a loose/bad lamp -- 
if the ground was bad all the lights on the fuel/temp gauge would be
intermittent -- they share a ground terminal. If you write details of your
problem gauges I can try to give you more specific help. 

o       Need new tires this spring. Recommendations? I normally put
1000mi/month on this car in all kinds of traffic and weather.

Depends on your expectations again. If you want a well-behaved, 
relatively quiet car, any Z-rated all-season tire will do. The Michelin
 XGTV, Pirelli UHP, Toyo Proxies are examples. If you want very sticky
performance, and are willing to accept the <10,000 mile wear, road noise, 
rough ride etc. that usually come with it, the Dunlop D40M2, Pirelli
PZero, Michelin XGTZ are tires you should look into.

>o       Carpeting is worn. Noted Tweeks' has a replacement carpet kit for

Almost any good brand-name carpet will do, unless you want custom colors,
 script etc. Tweeks is not the cheapest after-market for Porsche though,
 try Auto Atlanta, Zims etc.

Can be done on jackstands. Check out the 944 clutch FAQ at George B's 
page (I think): www.mhv.net/~georgeb.

Much easier on the soul and the wallet than some stuff the rest of us 
have to put up with to get our Porsches fixed! Have fun.
