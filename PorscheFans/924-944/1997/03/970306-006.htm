Sorry about the delay in answering your clutch question - I've been under the car to much!!
Eurospeed's number is 1-800-352-9441 - Talk to Ron, he has strange hours but if you have any questions about the products he is the person to speak with. the 944 clutch kit cost me $359 (Sachs not Euroselect - I've heard bad things about the Euroselect stuff) Other things you might want to consider 1) new hardware - Flywheel, pressure plate and CV joint bolts. I got higher strength CV bolts with hex heads (!) to replace the stock pain in the butt CV bolts. 2) new exhaust gaskets 3) if you are going to repack your CV joint heres a warning!! - Porsche and any of the part suppliers I contacted DO NOT sell the circlips that hold the CV joint on the shaft separately. You have to buy the CV joint kit which includes the boot and various hardware for twenty-sum bucks a piece. Over $100 for the whole job! I also found it impossible to remove the old circlips with out having them open up slightly and I do not wish to risk failure of a $1 part. I am searching for a parts source - any body got any ideas??
I would be happy to share any other wisdom gained through experience.
