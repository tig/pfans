Hi everyone,

Just wanted to let you guys know that I got what I think is a good deal
on my new radiator. There was a thread a while back about this and I
thought some of you might be interested. It was $178.00 (+ shipping, of
course) from P.A.R. in New York (1-800-367-7270). They have a new ad in
the new March Pano that flagrantly mimics the famous Vertex ad, only
almost every item is a little cheaper. Plus, you don't have the surcharge
to pay for credit card use. That always stuck in my craw. I'm not trying
to be anti-Vertex (I've bought alot from them and they've been good), but
the best deal is the best deal. I probably shouldn't talk yet, as it's
still just sitting in my foyer. It sure looks good, though.
