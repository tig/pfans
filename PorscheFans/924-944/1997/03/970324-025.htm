I am looking for advice on A-arm rebuilds. Both ball joints on my 85.5
NA 944 are shot, lots of slop, so it is definetely time to replace them.
The vehicle has ~230Kmiles, these may be the originals.  (The front
rubber on the vehicle was awful when I bought it last fall.  The new
D40M2's are starting to show a bit of uneven tread wear on the inside
pads of the tire.) 

  I am aware of several sources for A-Arm rebuilds, and will be calling
around to find the best price.  Any advice as to where to look? Should I
go for a more expensive but removable and replaceable ball joint
modification (I have heard of this, but don't know who does it)?

  This car is mostly used on the street, and is not lowered.  It will
see a few track events this year. 

  The car is up on Jack Stands in my garage.  I have removed the
following:

o Wheels, plastic engine guard, etc..  (duh)

o Front Faring (needs some work, cracks, scraps, nicks, etc.. will epoxy
fix this? and a new coat of paint of course)

o Sway Bar (Wow, its light!  There are a few spots where the thick
plastic coating is worn, any suggestions for re-coating these areas? The
PO must have driven into more than one high curve when parking..)

I will be replacing the following:

o Rotors (OEM)

o Bearings and seals (Local parts store, or OEM?  What kind of bearing
grease should I pack with? Synthetic?)

o Tie rod ends (sure had to pound these with a fork to remove, plus the
rubber was rotted, and I don't have one of those nifty tie rod end
removel tools)

o Brake Pads (Repco/Metal Masters seem to be suggested by most list
members)

o Yellow Konis to receive yellow touch up paint.  Where do I get the
tool to adjust these?

o All belts (Sure hope that Ron at Eurospeed gets that belt tensioner
calibrated, would rather spend $150 than $400

o Rollers if needed

o CrankShaft seal (Advice anyone?  two other people have posted about
this today)

I will also be checking the water pump.  Since I already have the front
end practically dissassembled, now seems the appropriate time to tackle
it.  The Air Compressor also doesn't work.  Are the rotary upgrades for
$300 worth it?  Or should I just get the rebuilt OEM compressor?  (This
is Vermont, it doesn't get too hot.  Maybe I answered my own question
here..)

Of course there are lots of other repairs that I am working on, but
there is already enough in this e-mail....


If anyone has read this far, and wishes to send me an e-mail, please
send to both the list, as well as to me.  That way we can all hear the
advice.  I suggest we all do that until the digest is fixed.  That way
the person seeking advice actually receives a response, and the rest of
us can view the correspondance for our own education.

TIA,
  
Ezra (ehall@btv.ibm.com)
