<<He thumbed his nose at my lowly 944 until I turned in a better time than
him
 at our next autocross event.  Seems that he needed to learn a few more
 things about driving his ultra tricked out custom bodied 911.  Also ahead of
 him were 3 more 944s and a pair of 928s.  The real clincher?  He even got
 beat out by a mustard yellow 924 with rusty rocker panels and one primered
 fender!  After that, he kept that old "All real Porsches are air-cooled"
 saying to himself.  It's HOW you drive not WHAT you drive, as long as it's a
 Porsche!  I'll shut up now.
