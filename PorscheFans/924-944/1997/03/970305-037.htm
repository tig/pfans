Hi, Porschefans,

I drove my first 944, an '83 model with 56k miles, as a daily driver for two years.  The 
only thing I did to the car was change the belts, front disks, and tires.  Total cost 
was less than $1000.  I sold it for the original price I paid for it.  However, I'm now 
making up for it with my '88 Turbo S. It's flying apart like a dollar watch, which isn't 
suprising since the previous owner treated it like a Yugo.  Maybe 20 years from now, 
these cars will have appreciated enough to make it worth the effort.
