The "other" conditions are very, very relevant.  For example, Paul and
Darren both run on street tires, but Paul has about three years more 
experience, as well as the fact he is a very talented driver (3 Regional
wins out of 4 entered in E/SP down here last year).  Darren is a completely
new driver and is improving very rapidly.

When comparing the two tires in auto-x, I would say the Dunlop is faster
in the wet and the Intermediate is faster in the dry.  The reason why it's
faster in the dry is not because of traction, but because of response,
I personally find the Dunlop a bit mushy on turn in, but it sticks, just
feels like it's not going to.  You can elleviate this a bit by turning up
the pressure to around 38-40psi instead of the factory recommended 36psi.

Personally, I'm a safety freak, not with airbags, but I like ABS, strong
structurs, engineering marvels like crush zones, etc. and one area of
great concern to me is proper tires and proper pressures.  I would never,
ever run two different tires front and rear, unless it was for a reason
(such as snow tires on the driving wheels).  My recommendation (for
whatever it's worth) would be to get another pair of Dunlops in the back
to match the front.

I would say at this point, it's driver ability.  You can't really compare
two tires unless the driver is the same and the conditions stay the same
and in both cases, the variables did not stay the same.  Bill Buetow runs
Yokohama A008RS-II tires 225/50R16 up front on a 16x7 rim and 245/45R16
in the rear on what looks like a 16x8 rim.  I hope he didn't mind me
looking :)
