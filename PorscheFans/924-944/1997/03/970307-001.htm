Hi Ezra I have a 1979 924 that simply won't go straight into second.  Like
you I'm becoming quite proficient at double shuffling into second.  There
is no way that I can change into second from 3rd without an almighty clash
of gears. 

I took my 924 to a Porsche specialist quite knowledgeable on 24/44 
transmissions he informed me that it was the synchro and it would cost me
$1200 AUS plus any other damaged parts to have the synchros replaced. ( 6
hours labour just to get the box out let alone look inside it)

My 24 is not too bad once the transmission is warm but when it's cold I
have no chance of getting it into second.

My problem became noticeable when I changed transmission oil.  Before
changing oil I had no problem changing into any gear.  I replaced the
transmission oil with Porsche specification oil (SAE 80) and since then can
not get into second without double shuffling.

The mechanic informed me that the previous owner more than likely thinned
the Trans oil down in order to get the damaged synchros spinning more
freely.  The Mech. informed that some car yards put a blend of 50% gear oil
50% auto Trans fluid into worn boxes to make them work more freely.  He
informed that this causes the box to work at greater temperatures and can
cause other parts to wear more quickly.  He also said that some times it
works wonders in freeing up tight boxes.

I'm on the look out for a reco'd or good condition five speed box myself, 
but they are pretty rare and expensive in my part of the world, I wish you
all the best with your 944.

By the way if you do find a cheap source for gearboxes or parts would you
mind sending me an email.

Thanks
