All this talk of SO and our toys... Sorry Jay I win. Barry can attest to the
fact that my wife has to be the most porsche understanding wife out there.
When I had my Mustang GT and was looking at Porsches SHE said we should sell
both our cars so I could buy a new 911 (I realized this would be a bad
idea). I then bought a 944, had fun with that, but was not happy with the
performance. SHE said well buy what Barry has (89 951). I found a set up '86
951 which I did buy. She also felt bad that I stopped racing motorcycles so
there I was buying a new Yamaha FZR600. She also suggested that I drive at
every track day Metro PCA has this year even though we have a 4 month old,
and are closing on a house (btw NOW BROKE!). Cheri also said I should go
club racing with Barry if I want to. She also encourages me to golf
w/friends, rock climb, and go on ski trips w/the boys.
No she isn't cheating on me, but if she was I would still have a pretty good
deal. Did I mention she wasn't pissed off when I spent the crib money on
last years new clutch and R1's. Hum maybe clonning humans isn't a bad idea,
think of the $$ I could make off her genes....
