Not far from here, there is a 1980 924S for sale. Or so they claim. This
can't be a real 924S, can it? I thought the 924S was introduced *after* the
944? It also has 4 lug wheels, which I found quite strange, and it was
remarkably cheap. It doesn't have a rear spoiler either, I thought these
were standard on the 924S. Is it just a regular 924?

My Porsche History records  and "up-fixin"show the 924S was re-introduced in
1986 with full production for 1987 and 1988.  Maybe it was a type for "88".
 They did have 5 hole wheels I think.
