when i first bought my car i bought it cuz it looked nice and being
in college that was important.  after a few weeks here i thought i really
should have put out a few more dollars and got a turbo.  insurance would
 have hated me but that is not the point.  since then i have spent close to
2000$ only to still get "raped" by 951s. i am a good driver but we are not
talking about racing im talking striaght line street style drag races.  I am in 
college and do that one in a while.  I have the headers, the exhuast, im 
working on a carbon fiber short shift with ferrari stlye gated shifter, have repalced
countless parts, water pump, power steering pump etc......  well as you can guess
it has made racing 5.0 mustangs fun and camaros who think they are bad ass.
the point being made was for all the aftermarket garbage, you can buy a 951
add mass air flow and a good computer chip and come out at the strip running
12.9's.  If i were to bore to 2.8 (and i might) get domed pistons and put another
2-3000 i might be somewhere near that quick!  the only IMHO way to make the
NA 944 run FAST is to supercharge it(turbo too but that gets expensive). for 3000
you can have about a 97% HP gain. however you scarifice reliabilty.  Corky Bell
of BEGI Co. can twin turbo a NA 944 for 10000$ and you will have 800HP. 
if you had that much money you probably would have bought the 951 in the
first place or a 911.
since it was kinda long i guess it is my .04!!
matt harrison
85.5 944
getting faster but willing to trade for a 951 if anyone is interested!
p.s. george b knows so much about these cars that it isnt even funny and
in this respect he was correct if you want the big numbers then you should
get a 951 OR check out the small block 400 conversion!!!!!!!! very cool
