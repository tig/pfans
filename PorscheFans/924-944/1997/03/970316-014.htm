The reason you don't see much 968 correspondence in our posts are two-fold:
1) there aren't many 968's and thus 968 owners out there, and 2) guys like
us with older cars probably have many more problems to discuss than 968
owners since 968's are relatively newer cars.
        I am a die-hard 944 turbo fan, and eagerly exploit any street
encounter with a 968 by flexing my turbocharger's muscle, but I have to
admit that 968's look nicer and are almost as fast.  Since they are newer,
I'm sure you'd enjoy some of the more modern conveniences and safety
features than what you're accustomed to in your '87 944S.  The engine is
much more tractable, and you're right, the specs are much better.  A
worthwhile upgrade indeed when you consider that most 968's have suspension
and handling packages identical to that offered on the Turbo.  They are
pretty rare, so I'm not surprised you haven't found one to test drive yet.
        Are you thinking of replacing your 944S with a 968, or adding this
car to the stable?  I don't think you'd be disappointed at all in either
case, unless you had a lot of memories associated with your current car and
it would be too painful to part with.  As you may have seen George B. say...
Good Luck!
