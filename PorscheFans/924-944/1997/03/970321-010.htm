	I think it's your fans. Since neither of them come on
	at all, and it's unlikely both motors went bad at once,
	I suspect your thermo-fan switch. I wouldn't suspect water
	pump at this juncture without reapiring the fans first.
	Get your fans working and I'll bet the temperature
	comes back down...good luck!
