	This isn't bad, just annoying. All 944's do this after
	awhile though I've forgotten exactly why now...

	That's pretty close to being the right tires. In fact, that
	may be exactly the right size (don't know about the 83). The
	car could've been raised somehow by someone...?

	Sell it and buy a turbo. That's really about it. Keep
	in mind that car is *very* fast...for 1983. Good luck!
