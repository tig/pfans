  Mark,

  I generally use Valvoline 20-50 in my '89 951.  I think that most
  people
  actually recommend Mobil 1 synthetic (Mobil 1 is also used in all
  new
  porsches).  Last time I put Mobil 1 in my car it costs about $28
  from
  k-mart,
  my car requires 7 quarts of oil to reach the fill mark when changing

  oil/filter.

  7 quarts of Valvoline 20-50 generally costs under $10 dollars.
  Since I
  usually
  change my oil quite often (every 1500 to 2000 miles) it is cheaper
  for
  me to
  use Valvoline.  I haven't had any ill affects with Valvoline.  I
  really
  didn't
  notice any difference between using the Mobil 1 and using the
  Valvoline.

  I generally try to stay away from oil additives.  I used a reslone
  additive
  this winter to supposedly free up a stuck lifter (I drove the car
  once
  this
  winter to free up the lifter).  I recently got my car out (a week
  ago)
  and I
  noticed that my oil was very dirty (I changed it).  Maybe the
  reslone
  additive
  does work at removing varnish and gunk from the engine...

  The rule of thumb seems to be, if the additive was good for the
  engine,
  the oil
  would have it.

  You must use phosphate free anti-freeze in your engine.  Other wise
  the
  aluminum engine will corrode.  I use the Sierra brand anti-freeze.
  I
  have
  about a 30 percent anti-freeze mix.  The more anti-freeze, the
  greater
  the
  protection from the cold.  However more anti-freeze reduces the
  ability
  of the
  coolant to cool your engine.

  Straight water would be the best coolant agent, however the
  anti-freeze
  contains lubricants for the water pump(s).  The anti-freeze also
  prevents the
  AC core from freezing up (during the summer).  If you run straight
  water, don't
  use the AC.

  There are additives you can add to your coolant called Water Wetters

  (redline).
   This breaks down the high surface tension of water to allow it to
  effectively
  cary heat away from the metal parts of the engine. (i.e. the metal
  has
  lots of
  pits and grooves which you probably can't see from looking at it,
  the
  surface
  tension of water prevents the water from entering these areas, the
  Water
  Wetter
  breaks down the surface tension, allowing the water into these
  areas,
  thus
  increasing the surface area that the water touches, so heat can be
  taken
  away
  from these areas).

  I don't know how well the water wetter works.  Anyone?

 Water Wetter works great, I run it here in Arizona in distilled water
and NO=A0antifreeze. Antifreeze LOWERS=A0the conductivity of your =
coolant,
ie lowers the efficiency of your cooling system. If you want to raise
the boiling point, go to a 22 psi cap. You only need antifreeze if you
are in a freeze risk area.

Also, if you are planning to run on a track, get rid of the antifreeze.
It is harder to get off the surface than oil and slicker too!=A0You will
be universally dissed if you put antifreeze on the track and everyone
sits around while they try to clean it off.
