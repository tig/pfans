Hi Pfans,

	I need the assistance of someone in Houston, Texas.  I located a 1988 94=
4
Turbo at an independent dealer in Houston and since I am in Puerto Rico I
need someone to do a pre-purchase inspection of the car for me.  I called
the Porsche dealers in Houston and was told that they do not do those
inspections anymore because of liability reasons.

	Could anyone in the list give me a hand and either (i) take a look at th=
e
car and tell me if the car is worth having a professional mechanic do a
pre-purchase inspection of the car or (ii) refer me to a professional
mechanic.  Anyone willing to help me please e-mail (either at
"lucero@icepr.com" or "TAndujar@pmalaw.com") his phone and the best time =
to
call.  I am several hours ahead of you guys in Houston so if you e-mail m=
e
the phone today I may be able to talk to you later on tonight.

	TIA.

	Nick And=FAajr
