Dan,

How are you?  I was in Aggieland for my first 2.5 years of college.  It
was a great place.  Is the "Chicken" still there?

To answer your question, I would absolutely recommend these autos!  And
YES, they are fun to drive!  I am considering the purchase of a 2nd 951,
one with very low mileage in very good shape.  I am also about to embark
on some research to find out how many, if any, 951 cabriolets are
running around Europe or Canada.  I know that there were non convertible
Turbos from 1990 and possibly 91 exported to Canada and would love to
have one of these as well.

If this is a daily driver that you will love and cherish like your wife
(or girlfriend), get an 88 S model or an 89.  If you want a daily driver
that will also be a track car (which I don't think is the case) get an
86 or 87 and do some suspension work and chip the car (the earlier non-S
models have a smaller Turbo that spins up faster and is a little more
responsive).  Others on this forum would be more knowledgeable than I
about this though.  

I would have to say that 1/2 of the money I have spent thus far could
have been avoided had I been aware of this forum or been "smarter" about
Porsche cars and parts prices.  I was also the victim of some real
idiots masquerading as Porsche repair shops.  I bought the car knowing
that it needed motor mounts, tires, a clutch, and a new dash.  I have
seen the thread about 951 value and I would be very willing to pay
$25-30K for a low mileage (30K or less) mint 951.  In my opinion, this
is a bargain because most of the big expenses are associated with use,
not age.

Recurring expenses that you can count on are:
Tires (every 10-15K miles if you use a nice sticky tire)
Brake pads
Oil and Filter changes every 3-5K miles
High Octane fuel
Insurance

Let me know how it goes!
