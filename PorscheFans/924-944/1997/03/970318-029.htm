I have a '86 944 - 83K.  The past day or two the tempature
guage has been staying right around the second mark on the
guage. This is fairly consistent, once the car warms up,
either on the highway or city driving. Outside air
tempature here is 60's - 70's.  

The cooling fans do not seem to be running after I stop
the car as they did previously. Previously the coolant
tempature stayed around the first guage mark - in town or
highway. If I open the hood I get a whiff of anti-freeze
but I can see no leaks and I am not loosing coolant. 

The car has been well maintained by previous owners and
records are available. However I don't have them here and I
don't know if the water pump has ever been replaced. I had
the drive belts replaced at 71K by a good shop and the
water pump, etc was good at that service. 

I think I may have a combination of problems. 

First either the fan thermostat(s) or a relay seems to
have failed. Is there a procedure to determine which one?
I have tools, power source to check relays out of the car. 
If I jumper the thermostat and fans start are the relays 
good? 

Second, Since the temperature does not come down at
highway speeds, a 5 mile freeway drive, I considering
either a bad thermostat or water pump. 

Any thoughts?
