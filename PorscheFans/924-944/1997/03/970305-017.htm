Here is a note for those asking what to buy.

I bought my '89 951 for about $14K thinking that I would do most of 
the repair/upgrade work myself.  The car is great but getting it there 
has been a chore.  I had a place that I thought was reputable check 
the car out and give it a clean bill of health.  Since then I have 
spent a small fortune fixing this and that (new dash, AC compressor, 
timing belt, motor mounts, broken exhaust studs, tires, it needs a 
clutch, my radiator is apparently leaking, and my turbo seems to be 
letting oil past the seals).  A word to the wise for those considering 
a toy like this - DO YOUR HOMEWORK.  This forum is full of great 
people who are very knowledgeable but spend the money to have someone 
with great references (and you better check the references rather than 
just getting a list) check out the car.  In hindsight I would have 
gladly spent $500 or more to avoid some of these expenses or at least 
get the sales price down to account for them.
