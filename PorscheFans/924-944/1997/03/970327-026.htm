Here are the details on "Airbag Reset."

As many know, I have been driving with an airbag warning ligfht for a couple of 
months.  I went to the dealer, and the tech ran through the diag procedure, which 
suggested a faulty crash sensor on the passenger side.  The individual diag result for the 
sensor was negative, in conflict with the computer diag result, but I bought a sensor 
anyway.

When we installed the sensor and tried to use the reset procedure to clear the indicator 
light, it would not clear.  The dealer said I probably needed a new computer, as the fault 
code was "stuck" (my words, not theirs).

A few nights ago, I carefully disconnected the battery, then the plug leading to the 
computer.  My goal was to shut off the irritating light until I could decide on further 
action (e.g., getting a used computer).  The car wouldn't start.  There is a circuit that 
won't let the car start without the computer plugged in (more specifically, certain pins 
must have contact within the connector).  This is clearly indicated on the schematic 
(within Turbo supplement), but I thought I'd try anyway.

Next, I cut the wires going to the instrument panel air bag warning and seat belt warning 
lights, but plugged back in the connector.  Bingo.  Car started and no warning lights.  
Good.

The next day, when speaking to a friend with an '88 Turbo S, I mentioned this problem, 
and he indicated that he had discovered a mistake in the reset procedure within the 944 
manual.

Here is the procedure (Section 68-23):

1)Turn off ignition.

2)Apply locally made tool on test plug.

 You don't relally need to have this tool.  What this means is that you connect a jumper 
  wire to pin 2 on the special test plug which is dangling under the glovebox near the 
  firewall.  The plug has three pins.

3)Press switch button (of locally made tool).  This really means that you touch the other 
  end of the jumper wire to a good ground.  They (and I) use the passenger door 
  hinge.

4)Turn on ignition.  Switch remains pressed for 5 seconds, is then released for 5 
  seconds, and pressed again for 5 seconds.

 This means hold the ground contact for 5 seconds, break contact for five seconds, then 
  ground again for 5 seconds.

 Note: the precision of a clock with a seconds needle is sufficient.

5)Turn off ignition.

6)Check whether fault memory is erased.  Turn on ignition for this purpose.  Airbag 
  sign light must go out after 5 seconds (indicating normal operation).

Here is the KEY MISSING STEP:

4a) Release the ground contact momentarily BEFORE step 5!!!!

Well when I tried the procedure with this key step, bingo.  Problem solved.  (Of course 
I had to splice the wires I had cut previously).

Anyway, I reconnected my supposedly faulty crash sensor and it was fine.  Now I have 
to have the new one yanked out so that I can return it ($80-90).  And I have to try to get 
some money back on the labor from the dealer, since the procedure was WRONG.

Anyway, thanks to Scott McKay of PCA GGR.  Scott drives his wife's '88 951 S on the 
track.  He is the fastest of our bunch.  The car is stock except for Weltmeister bars and a 
chip.  I am trying to gradually (over 2-3 years) get to his level.

Going to Laguna Seca tomorrow.
