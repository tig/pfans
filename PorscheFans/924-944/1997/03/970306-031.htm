When non-car people ask how much I paid for my car, they are always
shocked at my response.  They generally assume I spent about $25,000 -
$30,000 (to be fair, the car truly does look brand new, inside and out).
 I then have to explain that although entry price is cheap, it costs
money to maintain these vehicles.  

Prior to purchase, I had her thoroughly checked out by a mechanic
recommended by 5 different PCA members.  After the inspection, he
pronounced the car perfect, so I then told myself that I *only* needed
to budget about $2,000 for the first year's maintenance.  I have had the
car since May and have spent just about $1,000 thus far.  (1 CV joint, 1
halfshaft [much easier than replacing 2 more CV joints], and various
cooling related repairs that didn't *need* to be done just yet [ever
replace the metal pipe that feeds the water cooled bearings of the
turbo?  ouch!])  I expect that the clutch & water pump will happen
during year two.  None of this is cheap.

For me the bottom line is this:  I have yet to drive a car (new, or
used) for under $35,000 that I prefer to my car -- the M3 included.
Does this mean that I think the 944 turbo is the best car out there
under that price barrier?  No.  There are cars with better gearboxes,
higher limits, better low end response, etc., but the 951 is the one car
that always makes me smile whenever I drive it...and that's all I care
about.  My car is the best investment I have ever made and a decision I
know I will never regret.  Screw maintenance expense, the proof is in
the driving.
