I'll start the ball rolling for the 944 book and answer some pending questions at the same time. Due to time constraints I will tackle this one step at a time. the first subject will be:
"Reconditioning your sunroof cables and gears"
Here is the procedure to remove the drive cable, gearbox and latch assembly of your pre 1987 944.
To start this process you need to have the sunroof out and the latches fully retracted. 
Step one - Remove the panel that covers the sunroof gearbox and latches. To be found behind the sunroof and can be removed with 5 screws.
Step two - Unscrew the gearbox and the latches. (pretty obvious)
Step three - Unscrew the sunroof gear box cover (White plastic) and remove the main drive cable and it's tube. This is the cable that drives the 'big' gear and the first cable that you will see when you open the gearbox. Then set aside the gearbox and latches (we will look at these later).
Step four - Back to the left rear quarter and the sunroof motor assembly. remove all the attaching hardware (2 nuts in front and 1 screw in back). Carefully twist the motor so that you can see the 'other' side of the motor. You should see a white plastic cover plate (approx 1" x 3") that is held in by three phillips head screw. Remove this cover and this should allow you to pull the motor assembly away and towards the rear of the car (you have to pull backwards while pointing the rear of the motor assembly to the center of the car). Move the sunroof assembly enough so that you can see the side of the track that faces the fender. You will see a white plastic piece that slides inside the track. The cable is attached to this piece (you can't see that yet). This plastic piece is actually two pieces joined together about 1/3 of the way back (from the front). Use a small flat blade screw driver to separate these two pieces. 
Step five - Undo the electrical leads to the motor assembly. This is unplug located below the assembly.
Step six - Now you can remove the motor assembly.
Step seven - Measure the amount of the drive cable that is exposed. This will important later in the re assembly process. Pull out the drive cable. This may be fairly stiff!!
Step seven - Clean up the old grease and muck (!) on the cable. Use what ever obnoxious chemical you like the best!
Step eight - Cleaning the guide. This is a bit of a pain. I used some of the aerosol carb cleaner because it allowed me to use the little tube that goes into the spry nozzle, I inserted this tube into the cable housing at the sunroof and seal the tube with paper towels. At the same time I put a container below the end of the tube in the rear quarter. Then I sprayed like hell.
Step nine - Lube the cable with the grease of your choice. I had a hard time deciding if it should be a light grease for easy movement or a heavier grease because of the heavy loads that are encountered at the bends. I used some of the synthetic grease that I had for my CV joints, it works fine.
Step ten - Reinsert the cable housing. May require a little 'persuasion', if this hangs up try 'screwing' the cable in. There is a fair amount of friction when the cable goes around the bends.
Step eleven - Back to the rest of the 'guts'. All that is needed is a basic cleaning and re assembly. Inspect the gear to see if it needs replacement. This is a common failure and you don't want to do this again unless you are a masochist.
Step twelve - Re installing the upper assembly. The gear box has to be reassembled with the main drive cable.  Important - the latches must be at the same position relative to their bodies.
Step thirteen - Screw the gear box in place followed by the latches. (don't reattach the panel until we make sure this works!
Step fourteen - Back to the rear quarter. By screwing the drive cable in or out we need to adjust the cable back to the same position before it was removed. This does not have to be exact - just close.
Step fifteen - Insert the cable into the track and reconnect the two plastic pieces in the track.
Step sixteen - The end of the drive cable housing has a tab the needs to be in the correct position in order to sit flat in the white plastic housing. To do this the motor assembly needs to be near verticle. This makes it a pain to put the plastic cover with the three screws in place. Be careful the plastic does not respond well to force.
Step seventeen - Test roof operation. This can be done without reattaching the motor assembly - just make sure it's in approx. the same location.
Step eighteen A - Rejoice. Reattach the motor assembly and go dive somewhere while making the sunroof go up and down repeatedly
Step eighteen B - Get depressed. However there are still some other solutions - If the roof still binds it may be that your clutch needs adjusting (No, the sunroof clutch smart ass) This can be done with a pair of needle nose pliers in about two minutes.

Sunroof Clutch Adjustment Chapter
Step one - Remove the carpeting at the left rear quarter.
Step two - look at the motor! Find the manual operation screw / bolt. (Check your owner manual if you don't know where it is)
Step three - Where this screw (actually it is a bolt) enters the motor body you will see a nut that looks like a locking nut. This is the clutch adjustment nut.
Step three - Adjust the nut. Requires a needle nose pliers in most cases. Clock wise for tighter and counterclockwise for looser. BE CAREFUL - The plastic gear in the gear box by the sunroof cannot take the full force of the motor. Lucky for us most of the friction is between the motor and the plastic gear.
Step four - Make sure that the microswitches are adjusted so the the motor is not trying to push or pull the pour little plastic gear at the end of the range of sunroof motion.

Next chapter - sunroof limit switch adjustment - Coming soon!
