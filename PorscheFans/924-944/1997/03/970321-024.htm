To check your fans, jump the thermostat on the radiator.  Atleast one fan
should come on.  Also, when you switch your air conditioner on, atleast one fan
should come on.  Also check to make sure they are blowing air across the
engine.


To check coolant flow carefully feel the top and bottom of your radiator.  If
the top is cool and the bottom hot, then you are having flow problems.  If you
are having flow problems it is probably the thermostat in the water pump.  If
that checks fine, then there might be a blockage somewhere in the coolant line,
after that check the water pump.

To check the gauge, use the testing procedures in the haynes or service
manuals.  The temp sensor is on top of your engine.  My '84 944s gauge would
jump up a level when I turned on my headlights.  Does increased electrical
usage cause your gauge to go up and down?  If so you might have a short
somewhere.

One thing about these cars is that they run cooler at higher revs (I don't mean
red-line, simply between 3 and 4 thousand rpm) than at low revs (below 3000) At
low revs the pump is not pumping very fast, at higher rpms it has a higher
throughput.

My car runs warmer in fifth gear at 2800 rpms than it does in fourth at 3500
rpms.


good luck
