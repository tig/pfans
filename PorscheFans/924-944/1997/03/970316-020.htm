<< My windshield wipers on my '87 924S make a "scraping" noise when I use
them
 in the rain.  I just put new blades on and that didn't solve the problem.
  The blades seem to drag and skip on the windshield.  It seems like there's
 too much pressure on the blades (???).  Is there any way to adjust the
 tension, or does anyone have an idea of what else may be causing this
 disturbing noise?  Thanks for your help. >>

IWiper chatter can be caused, among other things, by the blade sweeping 
across the glass at the wrong angle.  This is most likely the case when they
chatter in one direction only. Check to be sure that the arm holds the 
blade at a right angle to the windshield.  If it's off a little, the blade
wont sweep
smoothly in one direction.  Carefully grab the flat surface of the arm with
pliers
(protect the arm) and twist it a little until the blade is perpendicular to
the glass.  The blade should then sweep at the same angle in both directions.
If the wipers chatter in both directions, or if the above fix doesn't work,
 try new
blades (assuming you haven't already) and clean the windshield thoroughly.
There was a lot written about this by Pfan members a couple of months ago.
I recall many posts citing RainX as the cause of wiper chatter, though I've
never experienced that myself.  Hope you find the problem -- that noise can
drive
you nuts!
