	Hehehehe...ask Barry Lenoble about this...

	You might try looking at the Platz Mall (www.platz.com). Most
	every mail order house has a link off that page to their own
	site or there phone number, etc.

	Ahhhh...now this is a good and complicated questions. There are
	extremely knowledgable people on both sides of this issue. There
	are actually three kinds of clutches you can get; the rubber
	center (the kind my car has), the multi-spring (the kind your car
	probably has), and the single spring (the kind the Cup cars have).
	The problems of the rubber center are known. What's less known is
	that the multi-spring clutchs have a tendency to fail because all
	those little springs come undone after awhile though you are more
	likely to get a bit more mileage out of your car with this kind
	than the rubber center kind. You will experience a bit more 
	drive line jerk, however, since the rubber center is now there.
	It's a bit of a harsher ride, in other words. The single-spring
	clutch doesn't suffer from the same failure mode as these other
	two since it's lacking the parts that fail. If I were replacing
	the clutch, this is probably the one I'd go with. Note that
	mechanics who know about this clutch are few and far between.
	I know that Andial has them along with a few other shops but
	most people have never heard of it. You might want to have your
	shop call Andial and talk to them.

	The rear oil seals. They're like $20 and if you don't do it,
	you'll kill yourself if they start leaking 3 days later...
	Good Luck!
