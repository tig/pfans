Has anyone noticed the the seatbelts seam to be backwards in this car?
(mine's an '84 944) I just replaced the drivers seatbelt and I always thought
my original was mounted incorrectly but the replacement is the same way. The
seatbelt always has to have a twist in it when in used. Does anyone know why
this was done and can it be fixed maybe by swapping the passenger and
driver's belts. I would just flip it around where the belt mounts to the body
the the metal clip attached to the belt is bent (by design) so that it really
only works one way.
