Roger -- sorry to bring potentially terrible news but it sounds like a
dying w/pump to me. If you had coolant in your oil you would know believe
me -- the oil filler cap would have the most interesting frothy deposits
and the coolant expansion tank would have chocolate milk in it.

The fact that you lost coolant also indicates the w/pump. It could sieze
sitting around, and when you first start the car it could just be tearing
up the cam belt or turning very sluggishly for a while, which would
explain your "2-cylinder" idle. This could be the result of too much
tension on the cam belt, so I would take it back to the dealer and demand
an explanation. Even if it is your w/pump dying a normal death they should
have checked the impeller rotor for free play and checked for leaks before
re-installing the belt covers. 

Bottom line -- you may be risking the ultimate 944-boogieman -- the broken
cam belt! If you decide to do the water pump yourself drop me a line -- I
might gather the courage to try this if I know I have a fellow masochist!
