Hello P-fans,

Well the first National Tour of the season is now history.  I had a great 
time at the event... driving to and from is another story.  Let's just 
say it was the worst drive I have ever made due to the weather, a blow 
out on the trailer, and a wiring problem in the RV.

Anyway, on to how I did;-)  This year my 90 944 S2 was moved up a class 
to A Stock forcing me to compete with M3s, 968s, MR2 Turbos, and 911s.  
There had been quite a debate about the competitiveness of my 944, but I 
am here to say.... IT IS COMPETITIVE!!  There were 12 entries in my class 
(one of the largest classes at the event) with Mark Sipe the favorite in 
his 95 M3 with Terry Baker expected to be a close 2nd in his M030 968. My 
goal was to beat Sipe in my first real event in the Porsche.

I can say I killed Sipe on the course both days.  Saturday was a wet with 
the track drying throughout the runs leaving everything up to your final 
run.  I had a decent final run with a couple of mistakes that put me into 
4th place less than a tenth from second (Terry Baker) but 7/10 behing 
Andy Bettencourt's M3.  Some of the drivers were going to protest Andy 
and Terry's runs because they were sent out onto a much dryer track 20 
minutes after the rest of us ran due to a mistake in the grid.

On Sunday we had a dry track and I managed to move from 4th to 3rd with 
the second fastest run of the day behing the same M3.  I was really 
pleased to see how competitive my times were considering the fact that 
this was my first non-local autox in the car and the fact that my driving 
was very rusty from the winter.  I made three costly mistakes on my 
fastest run on Sunday.  I truly beleive I could have won the race if my 
head was on straight.

The other complicating factor to my race was the fact that I was trying 
the Kumho tires for the first time.  They do act different than the BFGs 
and took some getting use to.  My first impressions are that the tire may 
have a bit less overall grip than the BFGs, but the usable grip is much 
greater.  These tires allow you to slide the car a lot better than the 
BFGs... they are not as sensitive once they start to slide.  With a 
little more practice, I think I can go faster on these tires than on the 
BFGs.  Also, the 265/45-16s will fit on the 9" rear rims, but it is 
tight.  I ran the 245/45-16s on the front.

The next big event will be the Pro Solo in Nashville the second week of 
April.
