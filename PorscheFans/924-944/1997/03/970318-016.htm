Just for the lists info the Koni warranty won't cover original equipment
shocks even if you are the original owner (except on the Mustang SVO).  That
would be up to Porsche and I don't think they'll warranty 944 shocks at this
point anyway, nice though though!  Koni warrants all new Koni shocks to the
original purchaser (purchased after 5/1/80) with the standard exclusions.

Juha - Your Koni adjustment is for rebound (extracting) hence your ability
to increase the force needed to extract the piston rod from the body of the
shock, but not the ability to change the compression (subtracting).  Sounds
like you've just got some worn out units in need of replacement.
