I overfill my 951 by about a 1/4" (i.e. about 1/2 qt.).  If your car is
not lowered, my understanding is that control arm failure is rare
indeed.  And since this sounds like it will be your first school, you're
unlikely to stress the car all that much -- you'll stress yourself, and
you'll feel like you're as fast as you possibly can (subjectively), but
it will take several schools before you start really going fast
(objectively).  Get your car inspected by a mechanic you trust and don't
worry too much about all the horror stories about the #2 rod bearing and
control arm failures (at least not until driving schools become more
habitual... And they probably will. :-)).

Have a great time.  PCA driver's schools are the very best reason for
owning a Porsche!  You'll love it.
