Now I see the problem. You are paying some one else to work on your car. 

People, if you want to own one of these cars you need 1 of 2 things,
either a lot of money, or a lot of time. 

This past weekend I helped a friend replace both motor mounts, a 
defective thermo fan switch, bad lower control arm bushings, new front
brakes (pads and rotors and fluid), and changed the oil and coolant.
Total parts cost was less than $500. Total time spent on the car
was close to 10 hours. If a shop had done the work, the cost would have
been well over $2000.

It's not that hard to work on the car yourself. True, you need some skill
(less than you think), tools, patience, and time. The benefits are in
knowing how the car works, and in insuring that the job gets done correctly.
The disadvantage is that it does take time (much more than a shop would
take), and that you have no one else to blame if you screw something up.
And after you've replace one clutch, you'll be a lot gentler on the new one!

Every car looks good from an ad in the paper. There's no warranty that
any car you buy is going to be problem free (unless you get a warrenty
:-) ).  The clutch could break 1000 miles after you get it home. Or the
water pump could sieze. Just because a car is low miles doesn't mean
it's perfect. In fact, I think that the more a car is driven, the
longer the water pump will last.

That's the important thing. You'll get over the money long before you
grow tired of the car. You could spend the same money on a new Honda
(well a new Honda would cost more to purchase but less to operate),
and nothing against Honda's, but which would you rather drive?

Probably good advice. However, a clean bill of health today doesn't mean
a trouble free car tomorrow. I agree that having a shop look a car over
is an excellent idea. Any problems discovered can be used in negotiation
or could cause you to pass on the car. Once you buy the car and start
driving it, that inspection no longer means too much. 

Personally, I bought my 89 turbo in April of 95. I knew it needed a water
pump, and replaced that promptly. I had to replace the clutch this winter.
Other than that, the car has been bulletproof for two years of track usage.
I've put over 20 days on at the track, and besides brakes, tires, and oil, 
I haven't had to change a thing. Let's see how many other cars you can
do that with!

Just my $.02 on the subject
