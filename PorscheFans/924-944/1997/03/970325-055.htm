The sunroof on my "86 944 did not work when I bought the car in January.
Since it wasn't exactly sunroof weather I didn't consider it a priority at
the time. I did do a little investigating, however, and I found that the
control module in the fuse box was unplugged, but again it was the middle
of winter and since the roof was closed and wasn't leaking I figured it was
better to leave well enough alone for the time being. Well, Spring is
coming so I decided to plug in the module and see what happened. Nothing. I
flicked the switch a few times and nothing happened, until the next time I
drove the car. I drove about a quarter of a mile down the road looked up
and the roof had mysteriously open on it's own. Now it had not only opened
without me touching the switch, but the switch wouldn't close it. When I
got home I hit the switch and the roof closed. Then while I sat and
watched, the roof opened again by itself a little bit at a time as if I
were flicking the switch. I pressed the switch and the roof closed. I
thought great, at least it's shut, so I quickly turned the car off and got
out to pull the module back out until I could investigate further. When I
shut the car door the back of the roof popped up. I opened the door reached
inside and pushed up on the back of the roof and it lifted up. The fingers
had retracted all the way into the car . This was quickly going from bad to
worse! I played with the switch and got the roof closed but stopped before
the fingers retracted all the way. I finally had gotten the roof closed and
secured, so I pulled the module back out. Unfortunately I'm right back
where I started,. With a sunroof that I can't use. Can someone please shed
some light on this for me.

Also, my oil pressure gauge does not function properly. As soon as I turn
on the ignition switch the gauge pegs and stays there. Should I just assume
that the sensor is faulty or should I investigate further before replacing
it.

Thanks,

Gary
