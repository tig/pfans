<Am I being a fool to think I could that all this car needs in some front 
suspension/steering work that I could do myself? My plans are to make it a 
good slow-track car - Konis, stiffer sway bars and shocks, and BFG R1s on 
the 15 inch cookie cutters. Hopefully the engine stutter will go away after> 
 
I think you're being overly optimistic....no one I've ever known has settled 
for a "slow" track car.  Yes, you can do some basic prep for 2K but I doubt 
you'll be competitive so you won't stop there.  Also, to run one of these cars 
and keep it together takes a bit of preventitive maint.  Let's go over the 
stuff I've done to track an 83 that's competitive.  I don't have current 
prices on this stuff but you can fill in the blanks. 
 
Suspension: 
-Konis 
-bigger springs 
-968 sway bar front 
-Weltmeister bar rear 
-bigger torsion bars 
-87 or later shock top mount 
or camber plate 
-positraction diff. 
-Competition brake pads 
-Weltmeister bushings 
 
Engine: 
-K&N free flow air filter 
-Bursch exhaust 
Preventitive care(necessary) 
-Turbo, external oil cooler 
-fresh belts, rollers, etc. 
-87 or later oil pan and baffle or Milledge mod. 
-fresh rod bearings 
 
Safety: 
-roll bar or cage 
-2 sets 5 point harnesses 
-better seat for driver 
-emergency shutoff switch 
-fire ext. 
 
Plus, another set of rims, race tires, numbers, etc. 
 
Don't want to discourage you but I think you can put $ into your S2 and still 
keep it comfortable enough for street use.  You can easily spend 5K on the 
necessary upgrades and you are starting with an unknown entity.  What if the 
clutch is tired?  If you're comfortable with putting your S2 at risk on the 
track it may be a much cheaper way to go.  Run it for a couple of years and 
get another street car and you'll have a track car too! 
 
I drove mine home 400+ miles when I bought it.  It was 90% prepped with 
stiffer springs, ect. and it was quite livable on the road.  Have fun.... 
 
My .02....
