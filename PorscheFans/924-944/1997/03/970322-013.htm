Decided to cover every question I had right here.  I have a '79 924.

First thing: I pulled the front speaker and found that the paper (stupid
'79 speakers!) was pretty well shredded, which accounts nicely for the
vibration.  So, I'm out to buy a new speaker.  But before I do, I wanted
to see if I could check out the rear speakers, thinking to save myself a
trip.

Well, I took out all the screws for that part of the fascia.  However, it
doesn't seem to want to come off readily.  My Haynes manual doesn't cover
this, so I'm being a little more careful than usual, as I'd really like to
get this back on without using duct tape (which the PO did to the inside
of the doors -- thanks!).  Seems like I have to get off that sort of
"wrapper" that's clipped at the top and the bottom back of the doors, but
*it* won't come off, either.  Plus, I noted with dread that I might have
to take out the windows -- not a procedure I'm looking forward to.

Next question.  I was looking through a Crutchfield catalog, so I could
buy the rear speakers even if I couldn't get them out yet.  (What can I
say, I'm impatient!)  It gave me the size and the location, but it also
said that I had front speakers in the doors.  Now, this is the 924/924
Turbo area (944s were right below), so I'd expect that they wouldn't have
to fudge it for the later models.  I know with near-certainty that the
body design of the 924 wasn't changed significantly, if at all, for later
models of the car (excluding the 924S); anyway, it didn't *say* 924S, it
said 924/924 Turbo.  I've had both doors apart before, and I didn't *see*
any speakers, but they might've been taken out.  I can see where there
might be room, especially if the armrest is removed, but no speaker holes.
Can anyone say definitively if the 924 has door speakers?

And finally, my wiring question.  Someone unplugged my fog lights from the
switch and now I can't find the right wire.  (At least I have a good
mechanic *now*.)  So I was thinking that my best bet, since the fog lights
themselves might not work, would be to pull the wire through, back into
the engine compartment, and then thread it back in.  However, there's this
plastic thing that I have to take out, and, again, I don't want to force
it because I gotta get it back in sometime.  Is there an easier way to do
this?  Even if I buy new fog lights, I'm going to have to go through this
procedure eventually.

Thanks!
