The only moderately time consuming thing to remove to retension the belts is the
timing cover, and that doesn't begin to get in the way of any of the coolant hoses.
Go ahead and replace the hoses yourself. Probably a good time to replace the
thermostat also if you haven't done that recently. Don't forget to wire brush any
accumulated corrosion or scale off the various pipe fittings before putting the new
hoses on. Replace any suspect hose clamps with OEM parts.
