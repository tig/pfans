PFans,

My son is thinking of having his '89 Turbo's  wheels polished and
(possibly) clearcoated.  We've seen several Turbo S and S2 cars in the
Seattle area with polished wheels and they look very nice... not as gaudy
as chrome, but a lot flashier looking.

I'm a bit concerned however about upkeep (for non-clearcoated) and =
whether
polishing reduces the value of the wheels.  Since the wheels on my son's
car are nick and curb-surf free, I think it might be better to keep them
as is and possibly just pick up a set of 17" wheels and tires when he can
afford them.

What do y'all think?
