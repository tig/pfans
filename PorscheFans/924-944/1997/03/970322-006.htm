Hey,

All this recent talk about thermostats and stuff has got me thinking. I'm 
about
to replace my radiator and coolant hoses. I figured I'd replace the 
thermostat
too, while the big hose is off. So which is the best to use? I live in the 
D.C.
area and we really get all kinds of weather. 100 deg+ is not uncommon in 
summer
nor are sub zero temps in winter. My daily trip to work is all highway (10 
mi.)
with about three or four stoplights at each end of the trip. I've pretty 
much
resigned myself to this being a purely street car. I've heard you guys 
talking
about 80, 83, and maybe 87 degree thermostats. Which is stock, and which 
would
be best for my application?

I'm also not sure whether my car (an '84) has an updated water pump or not. 
I
believe the thermostats are not interchangeable between the different 
pumps. Is
there an easy way to tell the pumps apart so I can tell what I have?

On a related note, I performed a "cooling fan operation experiment" today 
to
see how my car acts. Some of you were saying that you hardly ever noticed 
the
big fan coming on and I knew mine was on quite a bit. Here's what I found:

   1) When I turn on the A.C., both fans come on. I hardly ever use it,
      but I checked for completeness' sake

   2) At highway speeds, the gauge settles just under the first tick mark,
      no fans on. If you drive a little slower (35-40 mph), the temp rises
      somewhat, to the center mark or so (still no fans).

   3) At idle, starting with a cold engine, the gauge SLOWLY creeps up to
      just below the last (third) tick mark and both fans kick on until the
      gauge reaches the first mark again.

   4) Once the engine is hot, it will cycle through the above number three
      condition much more quickly (back and forth between the first and
      third tick marks) just sitting at idle. It takes about 4-5 minutes
      for the fans to kick in and they run for about a minute until the
      gauge hits that first mark again.

I can find no condition where only one fan runs. I think this is wrong. At
least the car never hits the "hot zone" on the gauge. How do you guys' cars
compare? If you don't mind, please e-mail me directly as the bugs don't 
seem


to have been worked out of the list yet. I've posted a few messages to the
list that I can't find in the web archives. Wierd.

Thanks,
