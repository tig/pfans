     I don't agree with this
     
     The correct jacking points at the front of the car are on the ends of 
     the box-section chassis rails, as shown in the workshop manual and the 
     drivers's handbook.  There ARE a couple of circular bosses behind the 
     wheels, slightly inboard, but these are intended for chassis alignment 
     purposes.  If you jack under these you will distort the floorpan.  I 
     say this with feeling.  In ignorance I used these points when I got my 
     first 944, and the distortion was enough to make the accelerator pedal 
     stick open!

Behind the front wheels, slightly inboard, are a couple of round 
supports about 2" in diameter. Pad the jackstand with a circle of 
1/2" thick plywood and use those.
     
Just ahead of the rear wheels, on the outside near the body, are a 
couple of square supports about 2" square. Pad the jackstand with 
a chunk of 2x4 and use those.
     
Also at the rear the alloy torsion-bar attachment to the chassis 
works well. Just be sure to use a wood block on top of the jackstand. 
That is a natural load point for the weight carried by the torsion 
bar assembly and would be a better choice than the torsion tube
or the bar ends, IMHO.
