When I ordered the Cup Car Head gasket,
Windward sent information on a new fuel pressure
regulator. ($195) It is not a steady 3 bar, it's variable
based on manifold pressure. This should improve
your MPG. you only get extra fuel when your
boost is high. for every pound of boost pressure
you get 1.5 pounds of fuel pressure increase.

At idle and part throttle fuel pressure same as stock.
At 15 psi boost fuel mixture is 9.9% richer.
My mechanic said he would check one out in his car
when he gets  his 944 turbo back together
He likes to try new things out.
