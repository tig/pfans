Hi all;  Looking for some simple advise.  Call me wierd, but where do you
have your tires changed?

I was thinking of getting some Dunlops through Tire Rack (most of you seem to
have had good experience with them), but I'm somewhat at a loss as to where
to have them mounted.  I guess I suffer from the "restaurant" syndrome - you
know, you don't take your own steak to the restaurant and ask them to cook it
for you.

While I have the lowly cookie cutters, they suit me (notably my wallet) just
fine.  While they aren't perfect, I'd like to keep them from being scraped up
any worse from a tire machine.

So.  Do you use some local gas station?  Tire store?  Porsche shop?  Speed
shop?
Suggestions, please, and Thanks....

Carl
