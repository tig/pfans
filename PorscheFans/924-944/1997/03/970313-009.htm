Well what I've always been told is to never use copper lines on a car as 
they are
too soft and will break due to vibration and such.  Some people I've 
heard do
use it and maybe there is one out there  who is still alive and can help 
you more.
Look for steel lines at your local auto parts place.

Well I'd have to disagree with you there, In the UK the most widely used lines 
are made of "Cunifer" which is an alloy made of Cupper, Nickel and Iron.  One of
the nice things is that it doesn't corrode, so you don't get nasty surprizes 
when driving older cars when approaching junctions where you need a footfull of 
brake and the corroded line perforates...
        CuNiFer is bendable by hand and is easily obtained in any autoparts 
store in the UK.  It is obtainable in fuel pipe size, get your local garage to 
flare the ends to the correct shape.  Use correct fittings for Cunifer, since if
you use the wrong material I am vaguely remebering something about galvanic 
cells and sacrificial cathode corrosion.
        Maybe one day this SUPERIOR material will make it by the American 
Standard Code Bureaucracy and get used so that the roads would be somewhat 
safer...  I have nothing against standards, although I do have something against
bureaucracies.  And if I spelled that wrong it's because this email system 
doesn't come with a spellchecker!
        Cheers,  Jan
