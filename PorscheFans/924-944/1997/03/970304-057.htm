For the last several months I have had a dull rumble both in the seat 
and at the steering wheel.  The rumble seems to be worst in 2nd gear 
at between 35 and 45MPH.  My clutch has rattling springs and I once 
heard a suggestion that a bad clutch disk could cause this type of 
vibration.

On the way home from the office tonight I had an opportunity to play a 
little.  At about 110MPH the steering wheel really started to shimmy 
and at 120 I shut it down it was so bad.  I could not tell how much of 
the vibration was coming from the wheel and how much from the seat of 
the car but it was in both places.  The steering wheel shimmy was not 
severe in the distance from left to right but the force with which the 
wheel wanted to move was surprising.

The front tires are 225/50 16 SP8000s that are relatively new.  The 
SP8000s replaced Pzeros.  With the Pzeros I had the car to 140 and I 
do not recall it doing this but that was a while ago.  The rear tires 
are 245/45 16 P700s and were on the car when I bought it (they are 
about to need replacing).  When they mounted the Dunlops they used the 
stick on weights as I did not want an unsightly piece of lead hanging 
on the outside of the rim.  I have been back to NTW once for 
rebalances and three of the four tires need to be rebalanced (one rear 
was OK).

Has anyone had problems with Dunlops, specifically the SP8000?  I 
suspect that the rear tires may be contributing to the problem but my 
gut tells me that I may have a bad pair of Dunlops.  NTW does have a 
warranty of some sort but my faith that they will admit a tire is 
faulty is nil.  I also need to replace the rear tires very soon and do 
not want to have the same problem.  I don't think it too much to ask 
that there is some type of QC in tires that cost $200 each.  I do not 
track the car but am very particular about performance, especially in 
the rain, so I am less concerned about tread life.

Could I be looking in the wrong place?  What else might cause this 
problem???

Thanks!
