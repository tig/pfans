While this thread is lasting, I have a few questions.

I changed my rear brake pads today.  In the process I checked out the underside
of my car (89 951).  I noticed that I don't have any rear springs.  On most
cars there are rear springs that support the vehicle and shocks that dampen any
rebound from the springs.  I'm assuming the rear shocks on my car serve a dual
purpose, to support the car, and to control rebound.

My car has been lowered, how is my car lowered when there are no rear springs?
 When I bought the car the PO said that the car was lowered and it was done
correctly...what does that mean?  Are there different methods to lower these
cars than new springs? (obviously)


Thanks!
