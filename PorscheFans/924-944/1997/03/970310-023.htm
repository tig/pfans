Uggh, this sucks.  You car is probably totalled.  From just what you've
mentioned the bill for your car is well over $3000.

However, I had an accident last year.  I let a friend drive my car.  He entered
a turn, hit the gas, lost it.  The car spun and went over the six inch median.
 (we were probably only going about 25-30 mph).

Odd thing is he didn't break anything.  The car needed an alignment, and the
rocker panel was bent, however everything else checked out fine.   Of course I
might have future problems...

Anyway, A-arms could be trashed, the ball-joints could be gone, steering
finished.  Who knows if any of the exhaust was damaged.  There are lots of
things that could be wrong...you'll just have to get it checked.
