You may want to mention that the Weltmeister chip upgrade on the 951 =
requires the addition of the wastegate shim.  THAT part of the =
installation was NOT easy, at least for me.  A nine year old exhaust =
system doesn't disassemble easily.  How hard was it for you?  I take it =
that some chips (Autothority) don't require the shim.  Can other list =
members verify this?  I also know that the Weltmeister chipset for the =
88 951S and 89 951 include a 'fuel enrichment' device, but who knows =
what it is? ( An adjustable fuel pressure regulator ?)

But, like you, I'd never go back to the stock chipset.  Before I =
couldn't drive the car slowly without thinking that I was bogging the =
motor.  The car has much better around town driveability and feels more =
like a big V-8.  The boost comes on immediately.  And it still has the =
big turbo rush when you floor it. Ahhhhh!

My 2 cents,
