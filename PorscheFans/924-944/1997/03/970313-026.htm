I agree 100% with what Dave Cooley has said above.  We just had a PCA
performance driving school in San Diego.  It was Friday evening, all day
Saturday and all day Sunday with food and drinks at a cost of $125 U.S..  It was
excellent! The instructors were great and the school was very well run. I have
never learned so much in such a short period of time or had so much fun
learning.  

One of the other old guys in the 944 group had attended the $1500 Bondurant
school in December.  He said the PCA course was equal in most respects, better
in some, but he preferred driving the Bondurant cars.  He had more fun at the
PCA school and felt less pressure (probably because he wasn't counting the
minutes with dollar signs).   I almost caught him in the auto-x at the end of
the course which I attribute to the superior PCA instruction.  

Attend the school you feel comfortable with, but never turn down a PCA school.
In fact, I would drive 500 miles if I could attend one of the same quality as
San Diego.  The worst thing that can happen is you will put some wear on your
tires and walk away with a huge smile on your face.  After you throttle steer
the skid pad with your arms crossed on your chest and your instructor holding
the wheel, you know that nothing can stop you from becoming a real driver.  You
will feel like spitting in the eye of the jerk that told you you would never be
able to drive your car to its full potential.  We may not be able to take our
cars to their full potential now, but we will with enough instruction and seat
time.

If you receive enough quality instruction, you will be able to tell your own war
stories.
