Me tagging along again.. I need to replace the whole cable from the 
antenna
to the tuner. How, oh how, do I do that? Does the cable run through a 
tube
or something, or do I have to take apart everything to stretch the new
cable?

I wired mine to turn on when I insert the key, without having to turn it
around. This way, the stereo quits immediately when I take the key out of
the ignition, and I don't have to turn on everything else just to listen 
to
some music. Maybe an idea?

Sounds like a great idea.  How would I go about doing this.  Where are 
the connections made in the car?  Should the red wire with the 10A fuse 
be connected directly to the battery?

Get larger wheels and wider tires. It does wonders for the looks! (and
handling, if you're that kind of guy..)  185/70-14 is what you would 
expect
to find on a family car, not a sports car.

To get the larger tires wil I need to purchase new rims, or can I put a 
larger tire on the same rims that I have now?  What size tire is 
considered a good upgrade from 14"?
