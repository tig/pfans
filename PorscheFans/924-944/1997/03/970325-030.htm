Matt,
     I have not obtained the adjustment tool yet, but Jason Burkett
posted the Koni phone number today, 606-727-5028  As I understand it,
the tool looks like a U with pins sticking down.  The pins fit into the
round plate on top of the shock body where the piston enters.  You
rotate the round plate in one direction or another.

  I use a floor jack under the jack point below the doors to raise one
side at a time, and place jack stands under the Front and Rear jack
points.  I use wood blocks to protect the vehicle.  The aforementioned
jack points are mentioned in the Owner's Manual, Haynes manual, etc..  
if you need to locate them.

Good Luck!

P.S. If an individual, such as Matt to whom I am responding, does not
include their E-Mail address, how do those of us looking at the Group on
the Web find the sender's e-mail address?  (Those of you who receive
each message via e-mail don't have this problem) I have looked through
the headers, but can't find the exact e-mail address..
