Have you guys tried adjusting the position of the switch at the rear of the motor assembly track? If this is too far back the latches will reach the end of their travel before the switch is tripped. This switch is tripped by a white plastic piece that slides along the track connected to the drive cable. The white plastic piece is approx 3" long and fulfills two purposes, with the key in position 2 the motor travel is stopped when the plastic piece first reaches the switch. (corresponds to closed roof) When the key is in position 1 the white plastic piece can travel further to the rear until the other end on the piece reaches the switch and stops the motor. The switch is held in place by one phillips head screw that is adjustable fore and aft without removing anything. If your motor is able to run with the arms fully retracted then I would suspect that this switch is either out of adjustment and should be moved forward or the switch is busted.
I set my switch by moving it fully back so that the motor would hit the stops (Like your situation) and then I moved the switch forward until it was stopped by the switch just before the end of the cable travel. BE CAREFUL - you could strip the gears if you run the motor against the end of the cable travel too much.
If none of this worked the first place I would look at is the Switch that I was just talking about. Take it out and check it's operation.

Good Luck and pray for sunshine!! (it's snowing here)
