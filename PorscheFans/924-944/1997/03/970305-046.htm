So Far:
Paid $14.6k
Dash 600 (this was a steal as they retail for 3K, I found a leather 
dash that Partsheaven was closing out) installed myself
Motor Mounts, Exhaust Stud, PS Pump, and AC Compressor 2300 (about 
$1000 of this was caused by a bad repair shop breaking the PS pump and 
AC compressor, I have to try and settle that in court)
Timing belt and 75000 mi service about 1200
Tires (front only) 450
Other misc stuff that I have not kept up with is probably 200 or so

Still need:
Rear tires
Clutch
Radiator
Turbo???
And there is a small oil leak according to the dealer in the front of 
the cam housing (or something like that) that they say is easy to fix 
but time consuming ($$$)

The car had 74k miles when I got it.  It drove well and the Turbo felt 
strong.  I had it inspected by a local Porsche/Acura specialty place 
that originally got me interested in P cars when they were working on 
my Honda.  The guy checked the car out for free anticipating that he 
would get all my business.  Long story but he turned out to be a real 
looser (funny how that stuff rolls downhill).

Since my purchase I have seen local ads for two 951s, one with 23k 
miles and one with 30 something.  Both cars were right at $20K. 
 Considering all the money I have in this and what is left to be done, 
I should have taken more time to look around.  The upside is that I 
now know what to look for.  I am really happy with the car overall, it 
was just more $$$ than I expected.  The car is very clean and straight 
which is important to me.  I hope to eventually get a low mileage 951 
for keeps and drive this one.  I am not as patient as those on this 
list who drive a 944 daily and save the 951 for special occasions, I 
want the power there all the time.

My advice: use this list to get three recommendations for mechanics 
where you live.  Pick two and take the car to each of them and the 
local dealer (don't let them in on the plan though) and compare the 
notes.  I have heard that the cost to check one of these out ranges 
from $75-$150 but even if you pay that two or three times you will 
probably be ahead of the game.  Even if you do shell out 6 or 7 
hundred, I bet the findings will allow you to negotiate that much off 
the price.

Hope this helps!

Mark,

I'm in the same boat with you... actually still at port waiting to
board... I'm looking for a 951... how much money have you spent to 
bring
the car up to par, how many miles on the car?

thanks in advance...
