Carl,

I would feel more comfortable at a Porsche dealer (assuming that they are a
good dealer).  Also, it makes a good "olive branch" if you offer them a
chance to compete with Tire Rack (don't forget to add shipping).

The dealer should know how to properly mount and balance those rims.

I had a flat last month (nail in the sidewall) and stopped in our local
Tire America for help.  They showed me that the tire was hopeless and
offered an exact replacement for considerably more money than Tire Rack.
When I explained that the same tire could be bought for less at Tire Rack,
they matched the price!  I will go back when I need tires (comparison price
in hand).  This shows that you can get your local dealer to play ball
sometimes.
