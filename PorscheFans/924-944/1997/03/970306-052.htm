The switch works fine, and the fuse has power because the other things
that work off it (power mirrors) work fine. My car is an '84 -- does
anybody know of any fuses/relays from the wiper switch to the motor?

I was told that the knock sensors and idle stabilizers did not come in
till the 85.5. If that is true how can I tell if the engine is running too
lean?

You're right about the enviro-worry Dave -- I live in eastern WA state and
there are no emissions tests, yet! Is that all the Oxygen sensor is good
for -- doesn't it affect cold-starting, the health of the cat converter,
gas mileage etc? Does the car run richer without the sensor?

Well to their credit they did claim to see some coolant on the w/pump
shaft and apparently one of the rollers is noisy. From my perspective
though I have not lost any coolant in six months, and I bought a
roller+belt kit in June 1996 so unless Vertex sold me something bad I
don't see the point of the extra expense. On the other hand a kit is only
about $120 if I remember right so if most of you think this is a
worthwhile expense I will replace the rollers. About the w/pump I have no
idea what to do.

Exactly my dilemna! What I do know is that I don't want to go through this
belt+roller nightmare again in six months, and the thought of a
precarious cam belt gave me a bad headache on the 400 mile trip back home.

The problem is I really don't have the time to deal with this now, and the
nearest mechanic who has ever touched a 944 in his life is 50 miles away
in Oregon. My question is: assuming I do have a small leak on the front
of the engine, how long do I have before that cam shaft throws up enough
oil to soak the belt and make it impossibly dangerous to drive? Please
remember that the belts have less than 6000 miles on them, and that I am
losing less than 0.5 qt. every 1000 miles. And I am talking about
tippy-toe driving, under 3k RPM when I do have to drive it. Would this
still be stupid? Anybody with oily-cam-belt experience? Any other advice
about diagnosing the w/pump?

> Is this Barrier?

Yes, it is Barrier. Thanks for the help Dave.
