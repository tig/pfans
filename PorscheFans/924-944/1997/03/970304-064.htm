Well, I'll take a shot at making a fool out of myself...  Like Sherlock
Holmes said, once you've eliminated all the possible options, what remains,
however unlikely, must be the answer.  You've replaced all the related
major accessories in the coolant system, so what about the NON-obvious?
For example:

* Are your electric fans actually spinning the right direction (the power
plug isn't in backwards, is it?)

* Is there some free-floating object in your coolant passages that is
getting lodged and then dislodged, perhaps even inside your passenger
heating core?  Power flushing with the thermostat removed would probably
eliminate this one.  You allude to something like this in your addendum
post.

* To me it seems more than coincidental that the oil cooler seals went bad
not too long after this all started.  In my 944, the oil/water combination
created a nasty, sticky sludge which clogged a vital moving part-- the oil
pressure relief valve.  Could a pocket of this sludge be trapped somewhere
in the head or block?

* Has the head gasket maybe slipped and partially block where the water
passages go through?  The fact that the cylinders have good leakdown just
means that the metal ring and surrounding area of the gasket are working
well, but doesn't necessarily tell you anything about the coolant passages.
Maybe someone can do a sort of leakdown test on the cooling system???
(this one's a reach, I know).

* Someone suggested running the car with no thermostat, but if there really
is something floating in your system, this would allow it to go straight to
your water pump, which might be good if it's weaker than the pump, but bad
news otherwise.

* Is it possible that the original water pump was somehow designed
differently than the replacement units?

Well, this is all just off-the-wall info, and a few days behind the rest of
the post-- Ron Clettenberg's info was pretty useful as well, and would seem
to fall in line with my shot-in-the-dark about oil/water sludge.

Hopefully you'll get this all worked out and enlighten the rest of us!
Best of luck!
