Hi All,

Today would have been a first. To drive the car three days in a row
and not fine anything to do on it. WRONG. I notice the steering wheel
vibrate and the back of the hood also. Looks like motor mounts. I was
looking at the 944 FAQ's on the R&R of the motor mounts and I have
one question. Item #11 said to remove the crossmenber or lower it.
Since it has the rack and pinion on it I don't think it will drop down
that far. Do I have to unbolt the Rack or disconnect it from the steering?
I am sure I will find out on my own, but maybe someone knows. 

Also, I was looking at replacing my rear speakers. I have done this 
before on my 85.5 944. My new car (new to me 1.5yrs old) had been 
repainted completely same color. I my opinion it is on OK job. No 
dents or dings. The problem is someone saved some money by not
R&R the rear windows and main windows. They just taped them off. 
Now the clear coat just goes to the window rubber edge. If I remove 
the window I will cause cracking on the clear coat and probably the paint.
The reason I mention this is that the insurance companies do not authorize
the extra $50 per window to do this. A friend of mine is dealing with them
now. You have to fight with them. If you have to, just pay it. It will save
you in the long run. Now I will have to build a box for the speakers and
place it behind the rear seat. Thx 

David 951 Burg.
