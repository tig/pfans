I used to jack to car up very night an investigate. This is what I 
found. My right front tire rocked like it had a loose wheel bearing. I
would tighten up where it was reasonable but had a litte movement that I
always thought was o.k. One night I had the car up and was looking at the
wheel with a shop light as I was moving the wheel to check the rocking I
notice that the whole spring and strut were moving. Actual what I thought
was the wheel bearing rocking was the strut moving. To make a long story

My '84 944 also has a mysterious wheel vibration at about 70 mph that no
amount of balancing and alignment seems to cure. I got new Bilsteins this
last summer but did not know of a strut bearing -- do you mean the shock
tower bearings under the hood where you mount Weltmeisters and such?
