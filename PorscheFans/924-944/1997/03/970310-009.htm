I have never seen a 944 (non turbo) break a timing belt without bending
valves, and I have been working on and racing 944's since 1983.  You can
go to the trouble and put on a new belt if you want to and try it, or be
smart and to check it out, align the cam up with the timing mark along
with the crank at T.D.C. and run a leak down or compression test.  On
any engine "only 1 bent valve" is too many.  The R&R of the cylinder
head is pretty straightforward, just be sure and have the proper work
done while the head is off, like having the head decked (shaving
..005"-0.10" off the sealing surface), checking and replacing valve
guides, refacing seats and unbent valves, replacing stem seals, etc.  Be
sure and check all oil seals (probably a good idea to just go ahead and
replace all of them) check all tension rollers and idlers.  Use the
turbo head gasket; goes right on and it is better.  On older 944's, it
is a good idea to go ahead and replace the oil cooler seals with the
head off, it is easier and if your car has a lot of miles, it is a good
idea.
Good Luck...Don Istook
