John, 

  As a few people on this list have already told me about my clunk, it is 
the clutch disk.  Since no one just replaces the disk, it will require an 
entire clutch job.  The lowest estimate I have gotten on this is $1040.  
If someone knows where to find a clutch kit cheap, please post it.  The 
cheapest I have found is over $500.  Throw in >10 hours labor and you get 
your $1000 price tag.  Or, find the kit and do it yourself.  I am not 
sure I am up to it.  If anyone in the Portland, Oregon area wants to to 
help, I wouldn't object ;)

Good Luck!!

Two answers to two questions - 
1) The clunking noise - If this clunk appear during gear shifts or any quick on and off the gas movements it's the clutch. The best test is to run the car in gear at approx 3000 rpm and apply the throttle and then abruptly let off on the accelerator .. wait a few seconds and get back on the gas, if you hear and feel the clunk it's about a 95% chance that you need a new clutch! From your description it's either just starting or you have a rear end problem. (I'd prefer the clutch!!)
2) Where to find the Clutch kits - Try Ron at Eurospeed(1-800-352-9441) I got my 944 NA kit (Sachs) for $359.99. Tell Ron that you got his number from me at this list - maybe we can negotiate a further discount for list members!! The usual disclaimer - I have no connection with Eurospeed other that a satisfied customer with a couple of saved bucks in his pocket!!
