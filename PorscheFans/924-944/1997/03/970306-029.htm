Hello,

I have an '86 951 with 91,500 miles on it.  I am preparing to take it in
for the 90,000 mile service.  The last time I visited the dealer for a
turbo problem they did an inspection of the car for me.  Apparently I have
an A-arm that is starting to go on the right side of the car.  There has
always been a shimmy at about 60-65 mph and again over 100.  My main
concern is that the car pulls to the right most of the time and to the left
some of the time.  I was told that a four wheel alignment would correct
this problem.   My question to you is: Should I replace the A-arm before
the alignment or dosen't it matter.  I would like to put off the
expenditure for the a-arm as long as I can.

Also, apparently three of my moter mounts are shot.  The service manager
told me that this would only result in a rough idle and not to worry about
it.  Do you agree with this?

Thanks for the help.

Jeff
