     Rob,
     
     Reach under the lip of the fender wells.  The Turbo S had those wells 
     "rolled" to allow for a wider wheel/tire combination.  If you have a 
     944 now you will understand when you reach under and grab it.
     
     Also the '88 should sport the "S" after the Turbo insignia on the 
     back.
     
     Front shocks should be Koni with the adjustable perch.
     
     Sound system should have the 6 speaker system with four of the 
     speakers in the doors.  Two speakers are located in the armrests.
     
     Also get the VIN number and call PCNA.  They can tell you every 
     possible thing about the cars original specifications you would want 
     to know.
     
     Marv (89 Turbo (same as the Turbo S))

     Received: from web (ppp05.b4futures.net [207.79.46.65]) by 
     In my quest for a 944 Turbo, I have come upon an ad in the Sunday 
     paper for
     an 88 944 Turbo...at a dealership.  Ugh.  But the evils (or goodness) 
     of
     dealers is not the issue right now.  Having never seen a 944 Turbo S, 
     I
     embarrassingly must ask if there is any way to tell the Turbo S from 
     the
     regular Turbo while the car is on the dealer's lot?  Like I said, I've 
     never
     seen a Turbo S, so I don't know if there's a big S on the back like 
     the S2s.
     Any help is appreciated and I apologize if the answer is:
     "There's a big S after the script 'turbo' on the back you idiot." ;)
     (Formatted for easy-quote replies)
     
     Thanks!
     
     - Rob
