Reading between the lines this sounds like it makes a lot of sense to 
do some PM (preventative maintenance) on the CV joints while replacing 
the clutch.  Is this the case?  If so, I wonder what this would add to 
the dealer price of $1200 to do the clutch job?  It sounds like there 
is a lot more you should do than a clutch on an 83K mile car while you 
are in there.  Do you have a list in your head of the logical 
repairs/PMs that should be made when doing a clutch job?

Thanks!

Sorry about the delay in answering your clutch question - I've been 
under the car to much!!
Eurospeed's number is 1-800-352-9441 - Talk to Ron, he has strange 
hours but if you have any questions about the products he is the 
person to speak with. the 944 clutch kit cost me $359 (Sachs not 
Euroselect - I've heard bad things about the Euroselect stuff) Other 
things you might want to consider 1) new hardware - Flywheel, pressure 
plate and CV joint bolts. I got higher strength CV bolts with hex 
heads (!) to replace the stock pain in the butt CV bolts. 2) new 
exhaust gaskets 3) if you are going to repack your CV joint heres a 
warning!! - Porsche and any of the part suppliers I contacted DO NOT 
sell the circlips that hold the CV joint on the shaft separately. You 
have to buy the CV joint kit which includes the boot and various 
hardware for twenty-sum bucks a piece. Over $100 for the whole job! I 
also found it impossible to remove the old circlips with out having 
them open up slightly and I do not wish to risk failure of a $1 part. 
I am searching for a parts source - any body got any ideas??
I would be happy to share any other wisdom gained through experience.
