Clean the terminals going into the float.  To do so, remove the rear carpet
over the gas tank, remove the rubberized mat underneath, then remove the
textile mat over the sender unit (its glued on).  Clean the contacts where the
wire plugs into it.

Sounds like a bad sender.  You might want to get a new one, or test the one you
have. Unless you actually have low/high oil pressure.

Don't know, could simply be shifter slop, bad shifter bushing, bad trany,
etc...

Probably is a CV joint.
