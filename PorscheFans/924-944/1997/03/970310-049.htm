Check the RPM/TDC sensors behind the engine in the top of the
bellhousing.  Make sure they haven't come lose, and follow their wires
to the connector at the back of the engine compartment to make sure it
hasn't come lose.

>A couple of days ago while driving my engine quit. No sputtering or warning.
>It just quit. I had just shifted out of third at about 5000 RPM and shifted

>sound of valves being crunched) but it won't even hint that it might start.
>I did check to be sure that the camshaft belt was still in one piece...it is.

>So far I've determined the following about the electrical system:
>Working backwards.....Spark plugs have no fire (almost new
>condition).....Cap and rotor are in good (almost new) condition and appear
>to have no defects.....coil did not test for secondary resistance
>specification.....replaced coil with new Bosch unit.....no change...voltage
>to coil checks OK.
