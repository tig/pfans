Hi all,

Lately I've noticed a sporadic clunk originating from the rear of my '86
951.  Generally it only occurs while backing up.  Sometimes it won't
happen until the brakes are applied, other times it happens immediately
after the clutch engages.  Occasionally I will also hear the noise while
moving forward from a dead stop, but *only* if it had just clunked from
reversing. This is definitely not a CV joint type click (3 of which are
brand new).  It is a deep clunk.  Kind of what I imagine a rear end
sounds like when it's going bad :(    

Any advice on how to proceed/determine exactly what is wrong, short of
taking things apart?  BTW  the car does not have a LSD.  If indeed I
need to replace/repair the rear end, I assume this is a good time to add
one.  Any ideas of cost?  Is the used route for such a part a really bad
idea?

Thanks,
John
