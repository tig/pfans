     The original engine compartment light contains a tilt switch, so it 
     should only come on when the bonnet (hood) is up.  If yours is on all 
     the time the headlights are on, it looks as though you either have a 
     faulty lampholder, or it's been swapped for a "normal" unit.

Folks,
     
Several insignificant electrical issues regarding 
944 Cabriolet:
     
i) Since the Cab. has no rear window defogger or switch, how (if ever) 
are the side mirror heaters activated?  The manual is silent about this.
     
ii) The windshield washer jets on the later 944s are heated -- when 
are the heating elements turned on?
     
iii) That cute little work light in the engine compartment -- it turns 
on when the headlights are on!  I would have thought it ought to
be switched by the hood opening.  I thought mine was dead (or not 
wired in), until I noticed a glow under the hood while driving 
last night.
     
and a more significant one:
     
Driving windy roads at night, the ideal lighting combination is  
high-beams
+ fog lights.  Tiring of holding the high beam switch back with my hand 
(compromises steering), it's time to re-wire the fog lights.  There's a 
proceedure in one of the recent Panorama's.  Has anyone done this?   
Do the
gendarmes take exception to the new lighting configuration?
