There has been a lot of conversation on the list the past few weeks about
the reliability of 951's and 944's generally. Most of you seem to be second
or third owners, so I'll give you a summary of my experience since I have
owned my 87 951 since it was new. I have transferred most of the service
history (the part I haven't lost, that is) to Q&A so its easier to keep
track of. I am not going to include the regularly scheduled items such as
timing belts, etc. but will only include the repairs that are not part of
routine service. This is not complete, but you should get the general idea:

Replace auxiliary cooling pump.
Replace clutch (1 under warranty, 2 at my expense)
Replace steering rack
Replace passenger side window switch
Replace clutch master cylinder (4)
Replace taillight (filled up with water)
Replace A/C switch
Replace dashboard & passenger air bag (warranty--I griped about premature
cracking)
Replace assist hose
Replace Motor mounts (3)
Replace bent intake valve (timing belt broke while at dealer's after it was
replaced)
Replace thermo switch
Replace fan relay
Replace turbo cooler pump
Replace alternator
Replace turn signal switch
Replace A/C suction hose
Replace A/C compressor
Replace lower control arms & ball joints
Replace coolant expansion tank
Replace intercooler pipe
Replace radiator
Replace water pump
Replace manifold gaskets
Replace shocks and front springs.
Replace front rotors
Repair sunroof
Re-glue hatch glass
Replace hatch seal

My life with the car started with a 6 year extended warranty. Nevertheless,
I have spent about $20,000.00 on the car (including many routine items which
are not listed above) since I have owned it. Most of the work was done by
either the dealer or independent shops. I do brake work and other minor
repairs only.

The interesting thing about this is that I have only tracked the car for the
past 3 years, and most of my expenses were incurred before I started driving
autocrosses and driver's ed events. In fact, the last clutch was installed
at 63,000 miles, before it ever saw a track, and the car now has 104,000 miles.

Yes, it is an expensive car to own. I still don't want to get rid of it
because it's so much fun to drive and it certainly holds its own at the track.

Sorry for taking so much space, but I thought you might be interested.

Mike
