	Dave, check the DME and the other items in the brain area for
	proper, no corroded connections. Check the DME itself; it may
	be going bad.

	As far as the power steering leak goes, you've got a couple
	of possiblities. Number 1, that horribly engineered canister
	and rubber hoses are giving way. Replacement of these is
	pretty straightforward. Number 2, the power steering pump is
	giving way and leaking. Not too expensive but a pain. Number
	3 (pray it isn't this), the steering rack is going out. That's
	expensive. try to determine where exactly it's leaking from.
	That should tell you what you have to replace. Good luck!
