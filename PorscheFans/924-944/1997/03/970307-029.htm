	I also like the 968 spoilers more. Unfortunately, you need a whole 
new set of molding for your hatch to install the spoiler and 
therefore I here quotes of up to 2 grand US. If you REALLY like that 
spoiler... by all means call AIR or something. Otherwise, just get 
the chin spoiler for the front. It definitely makes the car look 
meaner up front.
