The point was that it's hard (and expensive) to eek out more power from
the normally aspirated motor. For the same (or a little more) amount of
bucks, you can get a turbo with lots more power than you can hope to get
(reliably) out of a non-aspirated motor. The "if I had a nickel" comment
is simply a reflection of the fact that people asking about the latest

faster in your na-944, don't waste your bucks on HP upgrades: learn how

pretty sure George races an na-944, so he's surely not denegrating the
cars or their drivers!)
