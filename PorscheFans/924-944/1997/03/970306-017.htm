	Ron, he hasn't had a problem with it missing because they always
	install it when they put in a new pump so he hasn't had any
	experience with this problem. They didn't know it could cause
	the car to run warmer if it wasn't there and they thank you
	for passing that info along...

	I can't remember now whether I had the 80 or 83 degree
	t-stat. I remember that I knew back in August when it
	was done but I'll  have to check my records to know
	for sure now. If it is an 83, I may see about changing
	to an 80 and see what happens...thanks!
