Hi Ezra,

Get a bigger hammer!

Normal thread.

One usually helps.    

  A longer breaker bar?

That works, too.   Mine is four feet long, though I usually only use it for
computed torques beyond the range of my torque wrench.

  I

No way it ever would.

 How much torque

This question scares hell out of me, for it suggests you are about
to enter the dark tunnel of cam timing and belt tensioning without
a book to lean on.   If so, you should reconsider.


I'll leave the radiator to others.   Teflon might work, but that damn
plastic doesn't give you many options.

Good luck.

Dave
