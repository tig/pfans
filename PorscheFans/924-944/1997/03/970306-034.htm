No point in aligning the front end with a bad ball joint it is a waste of 
money.  Bite the bullet and get it fixed, You may not need an alignment if you 
replace it.  Same deal with the motor mounts.  Rough idle is not the only 
result.  You could damage other parts from the resultant vibrations.   
Spend the $ now or spend even more later....... 
 
PS:  Get another shop to check it out.  They should not have recommended an 
alignment if you need a ball joint in the a-arm.......If this is the same shop 
checking out the motor mounts I'd get a second opinion on both fronts. Telling 
you that it'll only cause a rough idle is accurate.  I'd be concerned about 
their competence.

Hello,

I have an '86 951 with 91,500 miles on it.  I am preparing to take it in
for the 90,000 mile service.  The last time I visited the dealer for a
turbo problem they did an inspection of the car for me.  Apparently I have
an A-arm that is starting to go on the right side of the car.  There has
always been a shimmy at about 60-65 mph and again over 100.  My main
concern is that the car pulls to the right most of the time and to the left
some of the time.  I was told that a four wheel alignment would correct
this problem.   My question to you is: Should I replace the A-arm before
the alignment or dosen't it matter.  I would like to put off the
expenditure for the a-arm as long as I can.

Also, apparently three of my moter mounts are shot.  The service manager
told me that this would only result in a rough idle and not to worry about
it.  Do you agree with this?

Thanks for the help.

Jeff
