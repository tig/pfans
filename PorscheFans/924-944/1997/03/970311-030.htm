I have a difficult time believing that anyone considering installation of
the standard red Koni's would find the ride quality objectionable.  Although
your car may be an exception (Porsche is a small company, anything is
possible) most sport suspension cars (M474, M030 and all Turbo S) came
original with sport yellow Koni's.  Since the standard red shock valving is
even less stiff than the sport yellow I would think they are a good choice
for someone looking for better handling while still maintaining a smooth
ride quality.  How stiff is stiff is always a subjective thing, but the
factory evidently was pleased with the sport yellow units for their street
cars. You are right that the Koni's are rebound only adjustable (except for
the double adjustable units now available for Turbo S).  Many owners like
this adjustment to fine tune the handling of their cars.  No shock, Bilstein
or Koni, can self adjust to all requirements, hence the need for different
valving.  My point in all of this is not to denegrate Bilstein, as I said
earlier, they are a fine unit, but to characterize Koni as a bone jarring
shock isn't correct.  Many things figure into the ride quality of a car,
shock valving, sway bar size, spring and or torison bar size, bushing
compositon etc.

I've got an '84 944 which I love to death and has treated me very well for
the most part, but recently, I've run into a very depressing problem.. I
can't get the sunroof to come all the way out!! That's a real tragedy with
spring coming so soon.. Here's the details, and if you can help me, I'll
thank you all summer long..
	The sunroof still operates with no problems when you're just going
up and down, but when I turn off the car, and kick it the quarter turn and
hit the sunroof button, nothing happens.. It won't make any attempt to
unlatch itself.. I was thinking it was either a problem with the ignition
switch,(but the radio still comes on) or the latches have just worn out up
top.  I'd like to try and fix this one my self if possible, so if you've
run into this and found a solution, please let me know..
	Here's another semi-related question: Where would you go to get a
new fiberglass sunroof piece?? At the end of the summer, I was taking the
roof off when a large gust blew the whole thing out of my hands, causing
it to flutter in the air like a drunken butterfly.  Like drunken
butterflies, my sunroof met with the asphault shortly after causing a
corner to chip away.. Not enough to let water in, but enough to make me
want to fix it before the paint job(hopefully this summer).  I've checked
performance, tweeks, and a few other catalogs, but haven't found one that
sells that piece.. Anyone know where to get it?? Thanks 
	-Fritz
