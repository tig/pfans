The '89 951's VIN number goes like this 95KN15xxxx, the '88 951s is 97JN5xxxx.
 The x is whatever production number it is.

I own an '89 951 (944 turbo)  my VIN is WPOAA2953KN150881 :

Here is what the eroneous VIN decoder makes of the number :

The VIN number is WPO AA295 3 KN 150881

The vehicle should be a 1989 Porsche
	The model: 944 turbo coupe.
	The assembly plant: Neckarsulm, Germany
The 2 passenger car had airbag and belts

The OEM engine was : In-line 4 cylinder with Dual Overhead Cam (wrong)
	Engine Displacement/Type = 2.5 L/151 cu.in., Turbo L4, DOHC
	Brake Horsepower (SAE) = 217 @ 5800 (wrong, and I don't understand it)
	Torque (SAE) = 243 lb-ft at 3500 rpm
	Engine Manufacturer = Porsche

The fuel distribution system:
	Turbocharged Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI)
	Fuel pump/ line pressure = 48-50 psi
	The ignition system was = electronic

This is a rear wheel drive vehicle

The first three characters {W,P,O} indicate the vehicles was a Porsche product
made in Germany.

The fourth character {A} indicates a 2 Door Coupe, Speedster, 4WD Coupe  (this
is somewhat screwy)

The fifth character {A} indicates the OEM engine :
	2.5 L/151 cu. in., Turbo L4, DOHC (wrong it's OHC)

The sixth character {2} indicates a Airbag and Belts

The seventh and eighth characters {95} indicates the Model was a 944 turbo

The twelveth character {1} indicates the Series:  944

The 9th character { the check digit } is 3
The calculated Check Digit Value is 3

Then tenth character {K} indicates the Model Year was 1989

The eleventh character {N} indicates it was made at the assembly plant in
Neckarsulm, Germany

The twelveth through the seventheenth characters {150881} is the serial number
unique to this vehicle.

Enjoy!

The hi-fi sound pkg was a 10 speaker setpu.  It probably was standard for the
turbos, however you can always remove options...
