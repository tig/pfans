I paid around $80-90 for the sensor.  The List price is quite a bit higher than 
that.  I bought the sensor from Carlsen in Palo Alto, although another dealer 
has been doing the servicing and troubleshooting on this problem.  This other 
dealer has a good service department, but their parts people sell everything at 
List!

I'm not sure that the original unit was bad, since the fault won't clear (i.e., 
the computer won't reset) with a new sensor in place.  Also, as I mentioned 
before, the individual sensor check did not indicate a bad unit, although the 
computer did.

I will try the "simple disconnection method" to try to get rid of the annoying 
light in the next few days.

Hi, thanks for contributing to the airbag thread.


How much do the airbag sensors cost?  Also, will disconnecting the airbag
computer turn off that damn warning light?


Thanks!
