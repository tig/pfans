Hi Jay,

Yeah, what great gals we have!  But I like to tell everybody that when I =
first (sort of) decided to sell my 951 my fiancee said "But you enjoy =
WORKING on it so much!".....Hmmm.  Do non-Porschephiles see something =
about these cars we don't?  Oh hell, half the fun of ownership is the =
maintainence anyway.  Just make sure you have a spare car (or two).

Regards,

J. Dean Roberson

	Hey, get this: My SO talked me out of a 93 Diamante and
	into the 944. Said I wouldn't have as much fun with the
	Diamante as I would the Porsche. She was right. Amazing,
	huh?
