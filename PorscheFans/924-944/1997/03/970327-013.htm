Here a few trouble shooting tips / questions:
1) If you raise the sunroof up manually  (just enough to crack it open) and then try to open it via switch does it work? This would indicate that you have a problem with the switches at the rear end of the motor assembly track.
2) How does the system work in key position 1? Do the arms retract to release the sunroof panel and vise a versa? 
3) When you say the motor was weak or strong could it be that the resistance of the sunroof assembly was different? Some times when the sunroof sounds weak it is actually meeting too much resistance. I pulled out the entire drive cable, latches and gear box and cleaned them up on my 86'. These cars are better than 10 years old after all - lots of junk and older dried grease was found. 
4) Yes there is a micro switch in the roof - it is in the center of the front edge of the opening (not by the lifting assembly)

I have a track with relays and switches if you are interested.

Try trouble shooting tip #1 - this will give some good info for further trouble shooting. let us know what happens.

In response to the '944 book' idea I will be glad to take some time and write up what I know about sunroofs, speakers and even a couple of 944NA clutch replacement tips.

Chris White - on the road to 944 Guruhood. Half the fun is getting there.
