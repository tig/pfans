First it won't start. I fixed it. Now it stalls!  I'll be driving along 5
minutes, or 40 minutes, and I'll be idling at a light, or coasting down a
hill and it just turns itself off.  And after that it takes about 2
minutes to start again.  The only consistent factor is that the car is
warm, and idling.  I can't reproduce it in front of a mechanic, of course :-)
It stalls about once a day.

I also have a minor power steering fluid leak.  The leak seems to be coming out of the 
canister or the two hoses under it.  Could that possibly be responsible???? Occasionally 
I see fumes rising from the front right corner of the hood, and the area around the coil 
is damp with the oil. I intend on getting this fixed but would like to get the stalling 
fixed first. (Have you ever stalled on the onramp to a freeway.  You get very unpopular, 
very fast. Plus its embarrasing sitting in a shiny black Porsche that won't start.)  

I have isolated the problem to be electrical. (I am not getting spark out of the oil.) 
In fighting my previous starting problem I replaced most of the gizmos between the spark 
plugs and the ignition switch except for the computer. Is there any way of telling if 
the computer is working correctly?

Finally, on a completely separate topic (almost).  My hazard lights aren't working. This 
wouldn't be too big a deal if my car didn't have a tendancy to stall in stupid places. 
:-)  

Anyway I can't decipher the wiring diagram in the manual. I'd like to bypass the switch 
to verify the switch is the problem before I shell out for a new one but I can't figure 
out how!


Any advice would be greatly appreciated,
Tx
