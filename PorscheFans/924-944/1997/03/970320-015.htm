	Eric, first is it an 85 or an 85.5? This is important. The two
	cars are very different. When you say "fan switch" which do you
	mean? The fan switch on the heater blower motor? Or the fan
	switch for the fans on the radiator? This is also important!
	From your post, it sorta seems like you're going about this on
	a spur of the moment deal. Let me caution you against this! 
	Bought improperly, these cars can come back to haunt you. What
	you should do first is contact your local Porsche Club of America
	region people and ask them the name of a couple of very reputable
	shops (probably where they take their cars) in your area. Visit
	those shops and talk with the people in there. If they're good
	shops, they'll be glad to talk to you. Ask them what they think
	about this model car. When you find a car you're interested in,
	take it back to them and have them do a pre-purchase inspection
	so you'll know everything is okay with it *before* you buy. No
	nasty surprises that way (hopefully). This is really the only
	intelligent method to use when buying Porsches. Good luck!
