If you want more power, sell your 944 and buy a 944 turbo.

This type of rotten attitude is what gives the standard 944 such a bad rap.
Sell my 944 to buy a Turbo?  Not a chance.  I've seen a few 8 valve 944s
that routinely eat Turbos for lunch at the track.  Plus, why would I want to

What it comes down to is "the driver."

George, I will speak for others when I say your advise and opinions have
saved people big bucks in the past so please keep giving both. There are too
many people who think they know what they are talking about, (no Chad I do
not mean you, please don't be offended.) and tell other members how to fix
"problems" only to be way off the mark. George knows what he is talking
about, his business depends on it. George also happens to be one of the
nicest guys in Porsche Land, so cut him some slack. The problem with
opinions is you sure to offend somebody as I'm sure I just have! Now how can
I get more HP out of my Turbo :)
