The PO polished the 928 style wheels on my machine, no clearcoat.  The 
effect is beautiful.. not as gaudy as chrome, but a nice soft, shiny 
finish that contrasts nicely with the black body, kind of like pewter.

The upkeep is minimal.  Just soap and water with the weekly car wash. Give
them a good rubbing out every six months with paste aluminum polish.  A
polishing pad on a drill makes the job easier (especially with my wheels,
which are just flat dishes, with little detail to fuss with). 

I wouldn't strip the clearcoat off the existing wheels unless it is 
starting to deteriorate, since I am a fan of originality, but it's yer 
choice..  ;-)

Gregor - N/A 89 944 2.7L black/burgundy/aluminum.
