Farzaan -- tried emailing you and got this message bounced back. What is
your address anyway, and why does your header in messages to the 944 list
lie about its address?!

Farzaan -- what is the stock fan switch temperature? In my '84 944 the
fans come on when the gauge reaches the first slash, which is barely
operating temp. As a result sometimes on the highway, at 60mph on a hot
summer day the fans will come on even when the engine is actually nice and
cool. The low temp fans are nice in the city in summer, but a pain in
winter when I drive through snowed up highways with both fans howling and
snow-blowers giving me right of way because I am more noisy! What is the
correct temp for both fans to come on and what is the cycle? Besides, what
is the advantage of an extra-cool motor (80 degrees instead of 83 degrees)
if your fuel efficiency is actually lower at 80 degrees?

Since it looks like major work in this category for my car, let me know a
little about these updates. Where did you get all engine seals from, was
it a kit? What kind of labor time does this take, and if you did it
yourself how long is the job? What are the updates to the oil cooler
seals, any other major updates? Was resealing the engine just
preventative or were you stopping real leaks? TIA.
