Ed, may I please have a copy of your CV FAQ in MSWord format?

BTW, I'm in the middle of a clutch job on my '88 Turbo S.  I pulled the
half-shafts and sent them out for the dirty work.  I don't have a parts
cleaner and was in a hurry.  Good thing I did.  Several of the bearing
cages were cracked, and two ball bearings were worn.  They will rebuild
them and bring them to my neighborhood for about $120 an axel.  Cleaning
and reassembly would have only been $40 if all had been well.

My CV boots are in OK shape, but I'm tempted to have them replace them
with the new ones I bought from Eurospeed.  Problem is Eurospeed only had
three of them, and I need the fourth one by tomorrow.  That means a
one-day UPS ground trip from Baltimore (Philly, or NY, maybe?) unless I
want to pay as much for the shipping as the part!  Do you know of a source
near me?  I don't have a copy of Excellence magazine as I never saw a
decent article on 944's in one. 

Thanks for the help!

Gary Windham

P.S.  I'm home today, working on clutch job!
