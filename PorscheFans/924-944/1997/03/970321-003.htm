Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for help diagnosing  a
noise originating (or so it sounds) from the rear of my '86 951.  I've
tried to personally respond to those of you who offered advice, but a
couple of those e-mails have bounced back, so I'll thank you all
together here.  

The popular diagnosis is that my clutch disc is going south, but the
noise has yet to occur when simply engaging/disengaging the clutch, or
roughly applying/getting off the throttle while at speed, so I am not
entirely convinced this is the problem -- yet.

About a month ago, I replaced one CV joint and a week later the entire
half-shaft on the other side.  Although I used my new torque wrench to
tighten the bolts to specification, perhaps the problem is here?  I will
thoroughly check the back of the car this weekend and report my findings
to the list.  BTW I will continue to try Chris White's suggestion of
abruptly getting on & off the gas while turning 3000rpm, but can anyone
think of any additional tests I should perform?

Lastly, I am on the digest which, as we all know, is not working very
well right now, so please cc me on any replies.

Thanks again,
John
