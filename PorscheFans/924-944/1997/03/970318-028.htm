You'll need a 24 mm socket to get the pulleys off the front of the crankshaft.
 10,13,17 mm wrenches are useful anywhere on the car.  Make sure you have those
sizes of sockets too. (there are other sizes used on the car, but these seem to
be the most common)

An adjustable wrench that will get bigger than 17mm.  Thats nice when you need
to adjust the balance shaft tensioner.  (I don't know what max size you need
though)

I had some funny bolts holding my starter on.  One was an 8mm allen head
socket, the other was a 8mm torx bit?  I think most people have standard bolts.
 The only way I could get the torx bit off was to use a small break bar.  The
ratchet head would not fit in the space available (I own an '89 951).

Oh, make sure you get a flywheel lock for the 924-944.  The lock bolts onto the
starter holes.

You'll need an 8mm triple square tool (bit) to remove the camshaft sprocket
(unless you have an older car, in which I think it is a hex-bolt).  I didn't
have any trouble removing the sprockets off any of the shafts, however you
might want to get a pulley puller anyway.

Mini-Mag lite, this is probably my most used tool.


The maximum torque you'll have to apply is 250 ft/lb (on the crankshaft bolt).
 My torque wrench doesn't go that high (only 75), so I ended up screwing the
bolt in as hard as I could.  A torque wrench with a low range is more useable
than one with a higher range.  (i.e. if your wrench runs from 10 ft/lb to 75 it
is more useful than one that goes from 50 to 250).  Some bolts use less torque
than 10 ft/lbs however (I think the lowest is 6).

I don't think you really need the spreader tool, but the balance shaft tool is
nice.  Funny, I ordered the spreader tool once and got the other tool by
mistake.

You can get them for a little over $400, you'll have to look around.

I've never done this, however I think any snap-ring pliers with exchangable
bits would do.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Good luck, and have fun!!
