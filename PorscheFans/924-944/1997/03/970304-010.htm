This is probably a FAQ.
Can the spring type tensioner (944 105 067 14) be fitted to engines
manufactured prior to 87?
If it can has anyone experience of a successful installation they would
share with those of us without a tension gauge?
Best wishes,

Richard

Hello PFans,

Yesterday evening on my way home from work, i recognized a very strange
idle behaviour of my car (85.5 924S)

#1  When lifting my foot off the accelerator pedal the engine reached
~1200 rpm - but then climbed up to ~1800 rpm and again went down to
~1200 rpm but only to climb up again...
This process of raising and lowering the rpms repeated itself in an
interval of about 1 second and lasted as long as i did not push the
accelerator pedal. (Needless to say that it was very difficult to drive
slowly in the 2nd gear through closing time traffic)

Does anybody have an idea what the reason for this behaviour could be?

Maybe this is just the continuation of three other problems i encounter
randomly for the last three weeks:

#2  When lifting the foot off the accelerator, rpms stay for about 2
    seconds at 1200 rpm and then constantly lower to ~850 rpm. The
    lowering from 1200 to 850 rpm takes about 3 seconds (i'm not very
    sure) - but in all events it takes longer than normally.

#3  While driving, the ignition sometimes fails *completely* for a
    period of about 0.5 secs. (Mostly when the engine is warm)

#4  When the engine is cold the ignition sometimes works rather rough
    and unreliable. (Many very short interrupts)

While problem #3 may be a defective DME relay - i have absolutely
no idea about #1, #2 and #4.

Does somebody has a "recipe" to track down and correct the error?
(Haynes manual available for reference)


Thanks in advance,
Günter
85.5 924S (daily driver)
