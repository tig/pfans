I LIKE this girl.    If you go your separate ways, give her my email address.

Now for the serious stuff . . .   You use the term "sounded".   Do you
mean LOUD?   Or an engine miss?

No need to assume.   The classic oil cooler failure puts oil into the
coolant.  Unusual to go the other way.   Your indicator is to look in the
cooland reservoir where you will see what looks like chocolate milk,
an evilly slimy mix of oil and coolant.   The absence of this does not
mean that you have NOT mixed coolant into the oil, but is certainly
a positive indicator of the opposite.   Also, while I have seen this
problem occur a number of times, I have never seen it result in
poor running.   Mostly, the engine doesn't care.

 I'm using Mobil 1 and I'm not sure what coolant looks like

Roger,   

I'm not sure I can resolve intermittant rough running with coolant 
loss, other than a head gasket.   I don't think they are related.   My
suspicions thus far are a failing spark plug insulator or something like
that.   I suggest you pull the plugs and see what there is to see.   
In my shop I would first confirm that the engine is safe by checking
the coolant/oil thing.   Then I would go after the rough running, looking
at ignition and fuel pressures.

Good luck.

Dave
