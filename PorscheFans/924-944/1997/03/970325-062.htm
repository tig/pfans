My point was not to argue that bolt on components work very well.  Most
don't.  Why the hell would you want to pay $40 for a round throttle cam?
Wide open is wide open.  You can't make any more power past that point.  It
just FEELS faster?  But, there are another 25 horses or so available from
the standard 944 engine.  Most of it being from restrictive plumbing.  The
point made about learning to drive the car made the most sense of all.  My
only point was the fact that a new Porsche owner is very easily influenced
by the people that they come in contact with.  Many of them consider ANY
current Porsche owner an expert.  Which you know as well as I, is NOT the
case.  If you instantly discourage that person, you can sour them on
Porsches all together.  Using that logic, I can go and buy a late model
Corvette, (Which will save about $4000 compared to the cost of a comparable
951) spend under $1000 in bolt on mods, and blow the doors off of most any
stock Porsche short of a new Twin Turbo.  It will also out handle most of
them, especially its direct competitor, the 928.  Let's not even discuss
repair costs.  So, you see, running with (and out-running) the big boys,
doesn't always cost big bucks.  However, I think you will agree that we are
all here because of our passion for the Porsche, and any Porsche is better
than no Porsche.  A lot of 944 owners an not afford to pay the price of
admission to buy a Turbo.  If they could, they probably would have bought
one to begin with.  So, rather than telling a new owner that his car is
hopeless and that he should sell it, offer some positive advice.  Maybe tell
him not to waste a lot of money on engine parts and concentrate on the cars
real strong point which is its nimble handling.  Each Porsche model has a
very distinct personality and it's our responsbility to help new owners
learn to enjoy their cars strong points.  What would you tell the same guy
if he had asked how to make his car handle better?  Buy a 914 and sink tons
of money into suspension mods?  I guess that the real point is the fact that
everyone knows that a Turbo is usually faster than a NA car.  So why go with
the "sell it, it's junk" attitude?  I'm sorry if I may have offended you,
but I feel very strongly about this issue.  I personally fell victim to this
type of attitude with a member of a PCA region that shall remain nameless.
He thumbed his nose at my lowly 944 until I turned in a better time than him
at our next autocross event.  Seems that he needed to learn a few more
things about driving his ultra tricked out custom bodied 911.  Also ahead of
him were 3 more 944s and a pair of 928s.  The real clincher?  He even got
beat out by a mustard yellow 924 with rusty rocker panels and one primered
fender!  After that, he kept that old "All real Porsches are air-cooled"
saying to himself.  It's HOW you drive not WHAT you drive, as long as it's a
Porsche!  I'll shut up now.
