Woo hoo. The winter is almost over and racing season will soon begin.

I plan to attend some drag racing contests.  The next door neighbor is going to
add a nitrous kit to his '71 (I think) firebird.  Supposedly the kit should add
about 250 hp to his engine in two stages (100 and 150).  I don't really know
how nitrous works, but I plan to be there when the engine blows.  (He said he
built the engine to withstand it?)

The nearest drag strip is 1/8 mile long.  What are good times for a 1/8 mile
strip?  I think he said his current times in the car are around 8 and 8.5
seconds.  Is there any advice on driving methods for drag racing, I currently
own an '89 951.  I don't really want to abuse my car, although the words "drag
racing" imply abuse to me.


Also, Solo II is coming up March 16 is the first race in my area.  The next
race will be my second autocross.  It is even in the same location (abandoned
airstrip, middle of nowhere).  It promises lots of twisty turns.

Do most people with 944 turbos keep their cars in 1st?  Everytime I shift into
second I end up redlining it at 60+ miles and hour in a slalom, way too fast to
make any quick turns.  The next turn after a slalom usually is pretty tight and
requires a down shift (into 1st), I'm wondering if it is better to avoid that
awkward downshift into 1st, and just leave it in 1st...of course I've only been
to one autocross, so I have little experience...


Any input is appreciated, thanks!
