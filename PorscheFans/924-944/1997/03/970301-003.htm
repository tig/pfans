Hi everybody,

To the gent who wondered if there was something wrong with him for being 
a perfectionist with his car, no.  There's nothing wrong with wanting 
everything to work.  I've probably spent 20 hours in the past 3 weeks 
chasing down problems with my remote hatch release, radio, windshield 
washers,...even the light bulb in the stupid ashtray.  Now everything 
works; well, almost.  George B., I'll still be in touch about that 
dashboard, warning buzzer relay, and end-caps for my rear luggage shade.

Anyway, I've a question for the more experienced list members.  I'm 
experiencing noticeable run-on when I shut down.  I had my T-belt and 
bal-belts, associated rollers, and tensioners changed only 2700 miles 
ago (and yes, I did have the "intial retensioning" performed 300 miles 
ago).  However, thee car ran-on a bit before the belt replacement, so 
I'm not persuaded these are related.  Last night, I shut down and the 
motor ran probably another half rev or full rev of the crank; to the 
extent that, despite my having removed the ing. key, the WHOLE damn dash 
lit up as though the car intended to continue running.  Talk about 
possession.  Was this car a '57 named Christine in a previous life or is 
there something I can look into?

Another piece of evidence for your consideration is that there is 
current 1.5 pints of Chevron Techron in the tank with a full 21.1 
gallons of 93 octane Shell fuel.  I've been planning on doing this for a 
while in an effort to improve fuel economy through cleanliness.  Since 
thee 0.75 pint bottle of Techron said it could treat 8-12 gallons of 
fuel, I figured I'd better use two bottles.  Might my problem be the 
octane of my fuel?  Long ago I think I remember telling list members of 
how high octane fuel caused engine knock and poor economy in my Nissan 
Sentra while 89 octane delivered 38 mpg with smooth running.  This 
hadn't occurred to me before because my Nissan is obviously not a 
high-compression engine.

Thanks for any light you can shed.
