I have been reading the postings on the jack points. From Automation
I purchased the "Jack Plates" for the 944. These plates are intended
to be placed on the floor jack and the plates fit in the sockets. Like
everyone else I jack up my car one a week to look around. What I do
is use a small jack on the socket behild the rear wheel and jack the
car up enough to place the main jack in the center and jack up one side.
Once the car is up I put a floor stand under the socket behind the
front tire. (This is for safety,hydraulics leak). I have not seen
any body flex or movement. I did investigate putting a floor stand under
what appears to be a rail, but I did not like what it looked like,as
pressure was put on the stand. I stay away from any front suspension
and any of the rear suspension. When I did my clutch on my 944na I 
place the car on ramps which was almost too high,but it did work
and was very safe. On my 951 my arm just fits under the front of the 
car, if the car fell it would ruin my day. (Especially is I was 
underneath.) Just my $.02. Everyone be SAFE.
