Hi Guys,

"What we have here is a failure to communicate", I have been following this
thread waiting for a chance to inject a bit of humor. 

As it has been pointed out in previous posts, when one rereads the original
posts, George B. was giving one of his usual matter of fact answers to a
question.  Chad made many good points although I believe he misconstrued
the true intent of George's answer.  Much as I might misconstrue Chad's
"bunch of jerks" comment.  The "bunch of jerks" certainly are not 
924/944/968 list members, the jerks are hiding on some other list
(Corvette?).

When I was asking a ton of questions a few months ago, George suggested
that I join my local PCA chapter and use it as a resource.  I had always
considered them to be a bunch of snobs, but figured if George was a PCA
member, I would give it a shot.  It turned out to be exactly what he said,
a great bunch of very helpful people.    

I make my comments with a bit of humor or wit and try not to offend (hand
me the Rightguard, Mr. Barkley).  If I inadvertently offend someone (usual
disclaimer), then may my water pump fall off.
