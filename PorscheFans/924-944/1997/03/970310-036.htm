I used the recommended high pressures in the Hoosiers which I tried.  These 
were the road race compound.

My guess is that the Hoosiers really only like to be driven on the track, not 
on the street or in AX.  We were out at Thunderhill Raceway Park last weekend 
and several of my friends ran them.  They love them and find that the wear just 
as long as the BFG's, but are 1-2 seconds faster. 

I tried an aggressive track-type heat cycling on my newest BFG's.  We'll see if 
they last longer than the last set.

Curious what tire pressures you were running? I hear they need 40's? but
you probably knew that. I'm a R1'er myself.
