Thanks for the reply.  Oddly enough I unplugged what I though was the 
O2 sensor with the car running and there was no change.  I plugged it 
back in and then touched the connector for the throttle position 
sensor and the problem went away.  Got some contact cleaner today and 
cleaned the flow meter and throttle sensor connections.  All seems 
fine.

Mark:

It sounds like a vacuum leak or false unmetered air.  Check all your 
vacuum
hoses.  With the motor running, spray some carburetor cleaner on 
hoses.
 When your idle stabilizes for a moment, the spray has temporarily 
stopped
the hole and you've found your leak.  Due to high underhood heat, 
hoses may
become brittle or porous over time.

BTW, you don't need to remove the O2 sensor to test it.  Use a digital 
VOM
and a pin to probe the wire in the pigtail.   It should read 0.2V cold 
and
 should oscillate quickly from 0.1 to 0.9V after the engine heats up 
and
goes closed loop.  If it's dead, it'll probably be stuck at 0.2V.  If 
it
changes slowly, it's 'lazy' and should be replaced.

The idle on my '89 951 is jumping from 700RPM to 1100 RPM like 
someone
is pumping the accelerator.  This just recently started and I
understand that it could be a bad O2 sensor.  I also understand that
the O2 sensor is connected to the wiring harness at the back of the
intake manifold.  I was going to disconnect the sensor as a test but
there are two electrical connections held by a stalk mounted to the
rear of the engine.  Which one is the O2 sensor, the rearmost or the
one closer to the front of the car?  Also, if the problem is not the
O2 sensor what could it be?  Throttle sensor???

Thanks
Mark
'89 951
