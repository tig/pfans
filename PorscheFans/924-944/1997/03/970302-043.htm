I am in the search for a porsche, and I recently saw an 83 944 in the
paper for $3800 the ad read along the lines of "looks good, runs good,
etc..." The question is- is this far to low for this car? granted, I
have not seen the car yet, as it it a bit of a trip to see. 
	If this is a fair price, what specific things should I look at in the
car? 
	 Also , is there a way to tell if a 944 has had the H20 pump upgraded
to the newer version? if not, are there ways to tell that the old one is
going bad, or does it go south all at once? 
	I am a good mechanic, and willing to do anything short of a complete
re-build myself.
	Is this car a total mistake? any comments would be appreciated.
Thanks!
