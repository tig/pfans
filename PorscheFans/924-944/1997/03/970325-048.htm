I think i have found a way around spending large $$$$ on buying new 
lifters.
It seems using common engineering practices the lifters can be repaired.
as long as the wear is not too deep as i have seen on neglected cars 
they are salvageable.
the process is basically refacing the surface and applying a few thou of 
hard chrome.
i faced mine on the side of a grinding wheel then spun in a lathe using 
sandpaper to finish.the finish should have a mirror like finish after 
sanding and be in a slight dome shape.Note measure lifter first to 
establish how much height you have removed.
Hard chroming is extremely hard (80 rockwell) and only a few thou is 
needed.too much chrome and you run the risk of flaking(hard chrome shops 
can best reccomend max layer for ensured safety).
Have the cam ground also if any wear is evident on it.you will most 
likely need new adjusting screws to compensate for the amount taken off 
the cam and lifter.Try if possible set it up so you still have 
adjustment left as parts settle in.
Remember if you have done work on the cam run it in correctly as 
reccomended by the shop who did the work.
I did my parts at $12 (Qty8)New Zealand each compared to $150 for a new 
part each..
and $50 for the cam grind compared to $350 for a new cam.I found a used 
car part supplier that let me borrow all his used adjusting screws and 
only take what i needed (why buy new they still work ok) giving me 
access to trying various sizes.
remember torque settings and careful with the oil feed tube.Replace the 
front camshaft seal while you have the shaft out,it's easy.
Any doubts follow the Haynes manual.


P.S 
Are any of you sick of those nagging screens that programs use.The ones 
where you have to click o.k before you even get to the real program.I 
have a freeware file which can do alot of things when windows pop up.You 
can set it to click any button automatically or start a batch file.Great 
for most programs, i suppose it will even work on those reminder windows 
for registration screens.Any one interested i can e-mail a Zip file 
attachment to you.To cover the cost of my download time could you mail 
me $1 U.S including your e-mail address and upon receipt i'll send the 
file.Note the file is free and the $1 is only to cover my download 
chrges.
