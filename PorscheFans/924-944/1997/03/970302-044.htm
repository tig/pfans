Very interesting! However, I tried this and the car still won't fire.
Although I have no way of really knowing how fast the the starter is
spinning the engine, it sounds about the same as it always does wher I
start it, so I assume it's turning at least 200 rpm.

Both sensors are definitly working. (I even swapped them and they made the
same readings when swapped).

My landlords happen to own a service garage and loaned me this wonderful
Snap-On hand held muti-meter / scope / diagnostic checker. It was very easy
to check both speed and tdc sensors, as well at the voltage to the coil
(none). After using it I told them I had to get one the next time the Snap
On guy came buy. They smiled and told me to be prepared to spend $1800.00!

The factory service manual says to make the measurement at the dme plug,
not at the sensor. In any case, by making the reading at the dme plug it
rules out the possibility of wiring being the culprit. Also, it's much
easier to crank the car and make the reading since the dme plug is sitting
on the passenger floor!

Matt, thanks for the advice, I'll let ytou know what happens!

regards,
trev.
