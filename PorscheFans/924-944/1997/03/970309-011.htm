  Dear Porsche Fans:                 '87 944 non turbo

  In process of tracking down eratic fuel injection problem. On acceleration
a slight stumbling occurs. Have tracked problem, hopefully, to the throttle
switch. Anyone out there have experience in bench testing throttle switch?
Here is situation, checking resistance  between middle pin (ground) and
outside pin #2  this test goes from Infinity to 0 as soon as throttle is
slightly open. The same test performed from middle pin #18 (ground) to #3 pin
goes from 0 to infinity at approx 3/4 throttle.
     I realize that there is slide adjustment for switch tuning, but I need
to know when the ohms are supposed to read Infinity and 0 and vica versa.
Even with the slide adjustment I cannot get both the pins to work at partial
throttle. Are they both supposed to actuate like the test on pin #2 at even
the slightest throttle pressure? Or do they acutate at 1/2  3/4 throttle etc?
At approximately $70 I would like to avoid replacing an electrical part that
cannot be returned.  
 
 Thanks guys.
