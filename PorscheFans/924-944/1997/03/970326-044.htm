The "Rodney King" thread prompted me to write this, but I
don't consider it a continuation.  Instead, I wanted to offer
a different perspective.  

Eight years ago I finally bought an example of the car I'd  lusted after
since I was a kid -- a 1973 911E Targa.  When I thought Porsche,
I pictured a 911.  I loved that car, but I couldn't 
practically afford it for long in this corrosive Northeast climate.
More acurately, I couldn't afford the other car I felt I had to have for
winter driving.  One had to go.  I had to get down to a single,
all purpose, year round car.  Two years after I bought it, I resolved to 
sell the '73 and wait until I could afford a newer,
more practical 911 (ie, galvanized shell and NO mechanical injection).  
The night before the new owner came to get it, I took it out for one last 
romp through the neighboring countryside.  The car never ran better.
With the top off on a cool, moonlit evening, and the magnificent sound
of that six howling off the hill and barnsides, I realized that this was 
what this car was perfectly suited for.  It's a glorious picture etched 
in my memory, punctuated by the understanding of my wife who, 
it turns out, sat on the window seat in our family room and listened 
as I wound that car out one last time through the hills of Poestenkill, NY.
Based purely on the sound of that sweet motor,  she recounted
every route I followed...
down Snakehill,  left on Plank Rd, 351 to Farm to Market Rd....

My resolve was short-lived.  A Nissan Kingcab was practical, but not
fun.  I got the itch, and decided to scratch it with an 85.5 944 I came
across with 26,000 miles on the odo.  "You won't be happy with
that" Chris said.  "I know it won't.  I'll just keep it for a year or so
while I look for another 911."  That was nearly six years ago.  
Yesterday,  I parked that 944 in its new owner's driveway.  
It had 105,000 miles on it.  Not just any 105,000 miles, mind you.
Many of them were on cool moonlit evenings in the hills of Poestenkill
with the sunroof out.   There were lumber runs to Tremont's when the 
sunroof served a different, unintended purpose.Others were through snow and
sleet,  chunks of salt from the passing plows bouncing off  the fenders.
But the best miles passed under me quickly, at historic places like
Lime Rock Park and Watkins Glen.  And I wasn't the only one who
enjoyed this car at these places.  I'd always have more requests by
students, and even other instructors, for rides than I could give in one 
day.  It was almost mystical to people who'd never been in a 944
how fast 150 hp could go.  A fellow instructor at Watkins Glen, who
drives a violently powerful Camaro Z-28, says it every time he sees
me..."take me out again in that thing."  You'd think he was a kid on
his first roller coaster ride as he laughs out load at the way the brakes
hang him against the harnesses.  He gets wild-eyed as I 
flick the car through the "busstop" chicane ... in 4th gear.  If the 
lack of acceleration and ultimate top speed bores him, he sure
doesn't let on. That car was set up beautifully, you see.  Get the balance
right
and there's nothing that handles sweeter than a 944...at least nothing
I've driven, and I've driven a few. 
I miss that car already.  It fit me like an old leather jacket. It was also
a dream come true -- just must have been a dream I didn't remember
until I actually owned it.  Then I knew. "Oh yeah, this is what I wanted 
all along."

I'm sure I'll eventually feel the same way about the 88 TurboS in the
driveway.
I figured it this way.  If a 150 hp 944 is this much fun,  a 250 hp 944 must
be even funner!  But I didn't figure on missing that old 85.5 as much as
I do.   Don't get me wrong -- I love the acceleration already.  But, to be
honest,
I kinda miss being able to dip my toe into the deep end of the throttle
without having to worry about drawing too much attention.  Half the thrill of
acceleration for me is hearing the revs climb, redline, snick-snick, revs
climb....
In a slower car, you get to enjoy that a little longer, after all.

They say it's at the track that the Turbo will shine.  Well let me tell you
something.  It damn well better, 'cause its got a tough act to follow.
I'll keep you posted.

Love 'em all,
Kevin
