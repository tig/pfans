For consistent track use (i.e., running an entire season), I'd would think
about a cylinder head stud upgrade.  For road use, the engine can easily
take the extra power the chip provides.  I've had the Weltmeister chips for
almost two years and have experienced no problems whatsoever.  The car has
suffered nothing in terms of reliability/drivabililty.  The chips (IMHO)
were worth every penny.
