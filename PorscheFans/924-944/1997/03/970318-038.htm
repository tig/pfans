The purpose of the CV - Constant Velocity -- joint is to transmit the torque from the transmission to the half shaft and the half shaft to the wheel at various angles without undue friction. This allows the transmission / transaxle to be mounted to the chassis / body and the half shafts (axles) to follow the motion of the suspension. It actually does a similar job as a universal joint. (If you look at the older corvette suspensions you will see that they utilize universal joints where Porsche has CV's). I just repacked my 109k mile CV's and they showed little or no ware. The one thing to watch out for is the condition of the rubber boot. Once you develop a crack or leak and the grease leaks out and the water leaks in the CV will not last long!

For anybody following the rear wiper thread - the connector for the wiper is located next to the sunroof motor and you have to feed the wiper wire down the C pillar. It's actually a fairly easy project - about 2 -3 hours if you have all the information!!!
