I thought I had an '85.5 944, well the story isn't that simple.  It was 
manufactured 10/95, so DMV considers it to be an '86.  The PO had the engine 
replaced with a used engine after a failed water pump replacement which 
toasted the engine.  It turns out that the engine in the vehicle is from an 
'87, since it has the automatic cam belt tensioner.  (Could it be newer?)  I 
am not complaining!

  I am about to send my A-Arms out for rebuild for $150 each.  Looking at the 
A-arms, it doesn't look to be too difficult to repair. What makes the ball 
joint replacement $150?  My brief inspection leads me to believe a clip needs 
to be removed from the bottom of the ball joint, the joint pressed out, and 
the rubber pressed out in the opposite direction, opposite to re-assemble.  
What's the deal here? Is $150 a deal?  The replacement ball joint for the 
steel arms is only ~$16...

TIA!
