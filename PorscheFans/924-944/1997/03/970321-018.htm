John -
From past experience you should feel a pretty vigorous thump when getting of and off the gas if you clutch center has gone. I belive that once the rubber center has let loose the free play is equal to approx 1/4 of a rotation. Another way of checking the clutch is to jack up the car and rotate one rear wheel while some one is keeping the other from rotating. if there is a significant movement then I would suspect the clutch. If you really want to confirm this get another friend and have them do the previous drill while you peak through the large port next to the torque tube - transaxle mating area. (remove the rubber cover first!!) If one wheel can be rotated while the other remains still and you see the drive shaft rotating then it's clutch replacement time. (all testing should be done while clutch pedal is NOT depressed.)

BTW - don't do the 3000rpm test too much or you could need a new clutch anyway!! This will put a good deal of stress on the clutch hub.
