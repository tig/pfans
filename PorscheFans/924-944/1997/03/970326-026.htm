I interpreted the original comment that the oil pressure gauge (meter)
pegs as soon as the ignition switch is turned on, but before the engine
is started. If so, it can only be a bad sender or a wiring problem. If
the gauge returns to zero when the switch is off, it's not the gauge
(meter) itself.

My troubleshooting technique would be to disconnect the wires from the
sender at the oil filter. If the gauge still pegs with the switch on
(and the motor off), it's a wiring problem. Assuming the gauge doesn't
peg, it's a sender problem.

Caveat: I'm doing this from memory so I may have the symptoms reversed.
But I don't think so. And of course if the issue is "pegs when the
engine is first started," like Menelaos said, then I will shut up and go
color.
