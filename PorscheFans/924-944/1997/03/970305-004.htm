Greetings:
To continue the sun roof thread - I have finally made my sun roof functional, thanks for the input Mike & Gary. The relubing of the cables followed by the adjustment of the clutch did the trick. (Hey! that means that I'm fixing two clutches at the same time! - This one is easier than the drive line clutch.) 
A strange thing did happen once I had fixed the cables & clutch (keep in mind that I had also installed a used sun roof motor). The sun roof operated in reverse. This is a lot stranger than it seemed at first, the limit switches still stopped the motor however at the limits of travel such as full open the limit switch would only allow the motor to try and open it further and not close!! The same when it was closed - the motor would only try to close the roof further and would not function the other way. The motion was also in reverse of the illustration on the switch ie - open was close and close was open. I examined the motor, switch, relays and limit switches and the connections all seemed to be 'stock'.
I opted for the 'quick' fix and reversed the wires to the motor (requires cutting and splicing) and the sun roof now does at it is told when the key is in the 'on position (2nd click). Just to make it more interesting when the key is in the 1st position I have to use the close switch to open the roof (just a crack - I'm told this is the sun roof release mode) and the open switch closes the roof and also overrides the closed limit switch allowing the motor to run against the clutch at the end of the travel.
I'm getting closer but still not quite right!! Can some one with a functioning roof tell how the roof is supposed to act while the key is in the 1st position.-How far does the sun roof open/move? Where is the limit switch that stops the opening travel?

Just seeking another path of enlightenment towards the title of 'Porsche Guru"
