I have 12,000 miles on a Tweeks rebuilt pump.  At $100 for the rebuild 
instead of $300+ for a new one, I was willing to take the gamble.  With 
Tweeks being around as long as they have, and a reputation to keep, I 
think the quality is good and it will be ok for quite a while.

There is no reason for it to have a shorter service life, as the wear
items (bearing and seals) are replaced.  However, I have heard that
quality varies between sources, due to the quality of the parts used. 
Some mechanics refuse to install them at all, most likely from being stung
by cheapo $15 rebuilds for VW, GM and other mass produced vehicles. 
Sometimes the impeller separates from the shaft and slips due to not being
reassembled correctly. 

From here, and the deceased Porschefiles list over the past year and a 
half, I don't recall hearing anyone mentioning anything about premature 
failures of rebuilt water pumps.
