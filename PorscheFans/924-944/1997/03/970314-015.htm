My 89 951 had a flaky sensor (mounted to the head) that caused erratic
fluctuation of the gauge, but most of the time it would just read
artificially high.  I noticed that when the car was cold the gauge would
read at the first mark.  I substituted a new one (actually, I just
connected the wires to the new one) to verify it was the sensor.

My cooling fans would not operate erratically, in fact I was concerned that
the car was overheating and the fans were not working.  The fact that you
see both erratic gauge operation and cooling fan operation would seem to
point to a common cause.  On the other hand, if slapping the dash does
change the temp. gauge reading, then you have a dirty wiring connection.

To fix the wiring problem, you must remove the gauge cluster.  There are
screws along the top of the gauge cluster that point into the top of the
dash.  There are more screws that hold the plastic (black) vent in place
(look into the vents, I think there are three).  I can't remember what
other screws hold the gauge cluster in, but once the black plastic vent
grill is removed, the gauge cluster screws should be plainly visible.  That
cluster can be pulled out and you will find several wiring connectors that
plug into the back.  If you get a can of electrical contact cleaner (Radio
Shack may have this, get plastic safe cleaner), gently remove each
connector and spray a sparing amount on both the connector halves.  Work
the connector on and off a few time to clean the connections.  Repeat with
all connectors.

Be careful with the electrical cleaner.  Many claim they are safe with
plastic, but there are so many types of plastic that some cleaners will
"eat" into the plastic and turn it into goo.

As for the cooling fans; there is a 3 wire connector that plugs into a
temperature sensor in the radiator.  It is located on the driver's side
about 3/4 of the way up the radiator (just below the hose connection).
Access is only from the underneath, as you will not even see it from the
top.  If the fans still misbehave, and turn on when you start the car cold,
pull the connector off the thermostat on the radiator.  The fans should
stop.  If not, maybe your relay is has a contact weld and is stuck on.  I
don't know of any other way the cooling fans should engage prematurely.  If
the fans cut off, that sensor in the radiator may be bad.  It screws into
the radiator and I think you will need to drain some of the coolant to
replace it.  If you have a multi meter you could check the sensor for
continuity.  When cold it should have no continuity to any other pin.

That's all I know.  I hope it helps.

>dear fellow members:

>The gauge still shows at the highest white notch on my 944 turbo.

>has anyone attempted to replace on and how much trouble is it going to be, I

>if i slap the dash the gauge goes down for a while, but in chgo it is ok for

>I also suspect the fan control is either pluged in backwards ( i dont know
>it this is possible) or maybe just that it went bad,, HELP!!!!!!!
