When I owned a 944na a few years back I had a simular problem with shimmy.
I never checked it at the high speeds you state,but it occured at about 45
and stayed until over 60. Itt used to puy my arms to sleep with the vibration.
I used to jack to car up very night an investigate. This is what I found.
My right front tire rocked like it had a loose wheel bearing. I would tighten
up where it was reasonable but had a litte movement that I always thought was
o.k. One night I had the car up and was looking at the wheel with a shop
light as I was moving the wheel to check the rocking I notice that the whole
spring and strut were moving. Actual what I thought was the wheel bearing
rocking was the strut moving. To make a long story short, I replace the upper
strut bearings and took the car to 100mph. No problems shimmy cured. The 
design it in that great even with new strut bearing it still had movement,
but very little. My new 951 (87) has a simular problem but not as bad. This
summer I will replace the struts and bearing. It turns out that my 951 has
a different strut bearing then the 944na. 944na= $37.00ea 951=$137.00ea. This
is also a dealer part as far as I know. Good Luck and be careful working under
the car.
