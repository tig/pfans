	Rob, it may just be me, but there is no way I'd buy a 951
	with a salvage title. There's just too many things that can
	go wrong. Remember, if the mechanic says there's nothing
	wrong with it, that's just his opinion. It's not the gospel.
	I'd wait and save my money for a car with a "clean" title.
	Good luck!
