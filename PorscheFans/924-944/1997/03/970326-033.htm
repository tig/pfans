Mark, I'm probably the last guy who should be giving advice but the fact
that you're getting backfires when you try to restart indicates to me an
ignition problem not a fuel delivery problem. I'd check for rainwater in
the coil, distributor, and associated wiring. Something is getting wet
and shorting out... and then when it dries enough to allow the car to
run, it isn't totally dried out and fails again in another few miles. My
'83 944 has rubber caps over the coil connections ... are yours there
too? It all seems to center around the distributor and electrical
system.

One more thought... is water getting into your DME? Either from a leak
in the floorpan or dripping down from the battery tray into the
passenger side floor under the carpet. (There was a whole thread about
this last winter.) Check and make sure the floor under the passenger
seat is dry under the carpet. That's about all this novice
car-fixer-upper can recommend. Good luck//Pete

PS My daughter-in-law is from Evesham... a lovely (pronounced "loovly")
town. I was there last year. Small world!
