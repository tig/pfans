	I'm considering going to a driver ed at SIR sometime in May. It's 
held by our local Porsche dealer, MCL motors. I went in today to ask 
them about some stuff and I got some pretty weird replies. Even 
though I will never hope to reach the speed of the PCA racers in the 
east I asked the technicians about lower control arms and oil 
starvation. The guys laughed at me and looked at me as if I didn't 
know a damn thing. The guy told me to run less than full oil to avoid 
splashing and they've never heard of oil starvation or lower control 
arms breaking. I know I'll never be using my 951 to the limit of 
those of you who regularly race but I figured prevention is cheap and 
thought I'd get people's opinion out there. From what I hear, filling 
oil over the full mark by 1/8th of an inch is procedure... is this 
after letting the oil settle? As for the control arms, my car isn't 
lowered and is pretty much stock so I figure I'm probably pretty safe 
there. Any other pointers?
