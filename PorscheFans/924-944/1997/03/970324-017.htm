Hey dudes,

I'm taking the car in for an alignment today and wanted some advice.  Paul
had his car aligned to what seems like a good compromise track/street
setup.  His alignment is:

		Camber		Caster		Toe
Front		-1.5d		(?)		0 total toe
Rear		-1.75d				0 total toe

Ever since that alignment, his car wanders like crazy on ruts and his
steering is very light.  Unfortunately, I don't have his caster specs,
but apparently it isn't adjustable enough to make a big difference,
is this true of the caster?  Does anyone know what the range is like?

I'm trying to figure out what causes his car to wander, since the toe
is zero, it can only lead to the negative camber, any experiences out
there?

Now, for mine, I want something a bit more streetable, so this is what
I'm likely to do:

		Camber		Caster		Toe
Front		-1.0 d		2.3 d		1/10" total toe-in
Rear		-1.75d				1/32" total toe-in

Now, the factory specifies zero toe, but I find a bit of toe-in helps
stability on the highway and loads the suspension up a bit for faster
responses.  Ideally, if it were a track car only, I would run toe-out
up front, but I don't want a tramlining monster.  Is there anyone out
there running zero toe that can give experience with tramlining?

I had my current alignment checked and it's pretty screwed up, there is
1/4" total toe-in up front! and only -0.75 camber up front with -1.75 in
the rear.  I think anything will be an improvement, but the steering 
feel great, nice and heavy.

Farzaan.
Send replies to me at fkassam@direct.ca also because I'm on the digest.
