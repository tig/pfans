I attended my second auto cross (SCCA SoloII) this weekend.  I'm currently a
Novice.  My car was placed in A stock.  When I exit the Novice status, I'm
going to re-classify my care as A stock prepared.  I'm not entirely sure where
my car fits, it has a strocked 2.8 liter engine (oh, I own an '89 951), plus
increased boost.  From reading the SCCA Solo I and II rule book I gather
increased boost is not allowed.  I'll probably swap out my KLR chip (currently
Auto-authority) and put the original back in.  I'm not sure what the increased
stroke does to the classification, the book only mentions that there is a limit
on the bore of the engine (unless I missed something).

I'm interested in what class Farzaan runs his car in.  It seems to me, in these
local events, everybody has some sort of hidden modification.


As last time I tried to run the course too fast.  I don't have racing tires
(sorry no comparos) I have Dunlop D40s2 (something like that), I think they are
the original tires on the car.  So they are getting a little dated.  If they
are the original tires, then they have about 45,000 miles on them.

I DNF'ed my first two runs (you get four).  The course started with a very
tight slalom.  I ran it in 1st gear, upon exit there was a sharp right turn.
 Upon *my* exit I shifted into second.  I experienced off the throttle
oversteer, which got exagerated when I put the pedal down.  I spun the car
around, ended up going backwards.  Amazingly the car didn't stall, I must have
put the clutch in just in time.  I continued on the course and just took my
time.

The second run was better, I didn't spin the car.  I DNF'ed though.  The course
was set up with a back loop.  You ran through the back loop twice.  In this
loop there was a diminishing slalom (where the distance between pylons gets
smaller as you go through them).  The two times I went through I *could* not
seem to see the last pylon and always missed it.  Rest of the run went well.

The last two runs I took slowly.  Trying to finish the course.  I quit putting
the clutch in when I braked, and left it in 2nd gear throughout the course.
 Seemed to work well.  I am still 6 seconds from being competitive though.  I
won Novice class (there were only two people), I guess I should enjoy these
first places while they last.  As soon as I leave Novice, all hope will end.

I need to work on being smooth, I am still a straight line driver, I don't
round out my trips between gates, I just zoom straight to the next gate, and
take a speed hit when I have to turn sharply (instead of rounding out the
turns).

Someday when I get some cash I'll be able to get a spare set of wheels and race
tires.  Guess I should improve my driving first though.

For anyone who is interested, Solo II is an excellent way to improve driving
skills (well, maybe not your daily driving skills)


Later! :)
