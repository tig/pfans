Yes Performance does sell a kit  for $80 to mount the Optima in the
trunk
of a 968/944 but I don't want it in the trunk with the long cables etc.
For
$80 I think I can build some kind of support for the battery to locate
it in
the original (front end) position.  To use the existing cables it looks
like
you must mount the battery on it's side which should be OK from the info
I have seen on that type battery but I was hoping someone had BTDT.  
Thanks again

PS. Luckily we have the web version as I've not gotten the 944 digest
for days
but have gotten two daily copies of the 911 one and some 928 ones?
