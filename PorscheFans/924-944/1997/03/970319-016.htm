	Clark, as I understand it, these lines require *constant* checking
	(as in every day or every time you drive more than 5 miles) to
	make sure you're not on the verge of catastrophic failure. This
	gets kind of old for people who drive on the street only so they
	might be likely to "forget" about checking this often.
	Apparently, when they go, they go all the way and you have *no*
	brakes at all. Can someone confirm this?


Back in my track days there were many warnings issued about the street use of Stainless Steel brake lines. I was told that the lines had a much greater bursting strength and would not 'swell' under great pressures, however the stainless braiding did not age well and that it did not cope well with many cycles of flexing or tension. The other problem is that abrasion from rocks, ect. could result in frayed braiding which makes a very efficient saw!! 
As a result of this info I never used these on track or street. I still have yet to see a 'stock' flexible brake line fail without being cut first.
