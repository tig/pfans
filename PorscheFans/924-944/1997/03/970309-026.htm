	Dave, they were only imported to North America through
	1989.

	Unfortunetly, just because it looks good, doesn't always mean
	everything is correct. Before you buy, have the entire suspension
	and body checked by an *independent*, high quality Porsche shop.
	If the dealer says no to this, walk away. Btw, is it a Porsche
	dealership? If it is, you get an automatic one year warranty on
	this car. Have they told you that? Good luck. Let us know what 
	happens.
