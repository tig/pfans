        Thnaks to all who replied re: replacement of digital clock on my
1987 944S.  I got six informative replies in 48 hours ("down with high
priced repairs!!").  Since I am fresh from the innards of my dash I will
reduce this procedure to writing as follows:

        1. Open passenger side door and remove the triangular piece of trim
that is on the side of the dash (one screw).

        2. Remove the screw(s) for the passenger air vent which are now
exposed. I removed all three which may have been too many. The "slider" for
the vent control can be pushed through the vent which should eliminate the
need to actually remove the whole vent.

        3. There is a plate to the left of the passenger vent which, when
pried off, reveals two screws (remove).

        4. Now the secret known only to a few german engineers (and everyone
who e-mailed me) - with your fingernails or a coin, turn the circular
climate control sensor cover counterclockwise (an eighth of a turn or so)
and remove which reveals another screw (remove).

        5. Remove all knobs for the climate control system (fan -
temperature - and the two sliders). Unscrew the nut on the temperature
control knob. Unscrew all four screws in order to loosen the climate control
aseembly (need not be removed). The two screws on th right hand side also
hold the trim piece for the clock.  

        6. The trim is now loose from the dash. I found it a little
difficult to get to the clock until I popped the hazard flasher switch out
of the trim.  The clock is held to the trim by two very small phillips head
screws and two tabs that fit into slots in the trim. The screws must be
removed.  There is a plug for the clock that comes off easily.

        7. Replace your clock.  Pop the hazard switch back into its slot.
Prepare to do battle with the air temperature sensor which connects into a
small black hose that is probably now hiding inside the dash. Find this hose
before you reattach the clock plug and the four way flasher switch.
Position the hose in the hole and push the trim piece in so that the sensor
tube goes into the hose (this is the way I did it - like the light in the
fridge, I assume its working when I close the door). Took me 45 minutes.

Thanks again!
