This torque figure is also incorrect.  My '86 951 has 243 lb-ft @ 3,500 RPM,
the "S" should have around 258 ft-lb @ 4,000 RPM right?  Anyone know where I
can get my hands on that DOHC model?  I wonder how much torque one of those
puppies would have!   :)
        I've noticed that some insurance agencies and state DMV's also
confuse 944 specifications.  They are pretty careless about the differences
among all of the 944 flavors and varieties.  Sometimes they even lump 951's
with base 944's when calculating state property taxes by only indicating
"944" instead of "944 Turbo" on vehicle registration cards and titles!
