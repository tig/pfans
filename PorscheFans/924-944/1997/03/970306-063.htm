Will someone (still sane) talk to Farz. I think this is what happen when =
you have too much turbo boost and ruined your brain. I don't think I =
will join the convoy, just asking for speeding ticket or even getting =
arrested. Watch out Farz, you still have an outstanding ticket somewhere =
in the States, right?

Subject: 	Kent event trip schedule.

Hey dudes,

Here is the schedule for those going down to the Kent, WA event at =
Boeing.
You can get exact details of how to get from I5 to the event from the
Western Washington Sports Car Council web site. =20

Anyone in B.C. or Western Washington is welcome to join us, I know that
the following people are attending for sure:

Paul     89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Lou      89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Darren   87 944 Turbo (chipped)
Me       89 944 Turbo (chipped)
Squamish 97 944S (I've lost this guys email so I hope he gets this =
email)
Tom Putz 89 944 Turbo (stock) I'm gonna try and convince Tom and his Son =
to
                              autocross their car :)

The Canadian contingent is meeting at the Peace Arch border at 6:00am.
There maybe others from our region coming down with us too (non p-cars).

Since there is only one person from WA coming that has never done this
before, I don't think we will stop at South Center this time.  We'll
just meet Tom at the event site.  Tom, if you need instructions, I can =
get
them off the web for you on how to get there.

As usual, ANY of the p-car Canadians are more than willing to take ANY
passenger for a ride (as long as they sign the waiver), so if you've =
never
done this before and are looking for a way to experience it, come up to =
ANY
one of us and we'll take you for a run.  It's quite something when 17=20
pounds of boost come on as the driver exits the tight bend on slicks in=20
the rain and you have ZERO control over your future destiny :)

Paul and I are also going to attempt to assist with Tech, with Bill =
Buetow's
assistance.

I hope to see more people out this time, we had 7 last time, I want to =
bring
more this time.

Any questions, let me know.

Farzaan.
89 951 - 14psi (hoping for a wet weekend, I need the practice!)
