Roger,

Don't take out the seats to run cables.  If you do, it is likely the end result
will look poor.  The lower rear seat is glued to the body of the car.  If you
want to run wires to the back use the stock wires as guides.  If you pull up
the plastic runner pieces (on the door sills) you'll see wires underneath, run
your wires through here.  The stock wires usually go into the rear panels, you
can loosen the lower half of the panels to run your wires inside these panels,
(once loosened you should be able to slip your wires behind them)   The panels
are held in by some trim screws and by clips.  Carefull when You pull the
panels from the car that you don't pull the clips out of the panel, if you do,
you should be able to screw the clips back into their holes in the panel.  You
only need to pull the lower half of the panel, don't worry about the dreaded
window trim removal.  You should be able to get enough room to run your wires
behind the trim and behind the rear side carpets.

Good luck!
