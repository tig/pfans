John, 

  As a few people on this list have already told me about my clunk, it is 
the clutch disk.  Since no one just replaces the disk, it will require an 
entire clutch job.  The lowest estimate I have gotten on this is $1040.  
If someone knows where to find a clutch kit cheap, please post it.  The 
cheapest I have found is over $500.  Throw in >10 hours labor and you get 
your $1000 price tag.  Or, find the kit and do it yourself.  I am not 
sure I am up to it.  If anyone in the Portland, Oregon area wants to to 
help, I wouldn't object ;)

Good Luck!!
