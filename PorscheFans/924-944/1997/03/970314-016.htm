The most weird car-stealing attempt I have ever seen (and that the local
PD has ever had to strain its collective intellectual skills over)
happened to my car the night before last. 

The car was parked in a college parking lot, with its back to a hedge.
These idiots broke in, must have set the alarm off, and strangely enough
located the siren real quick and ripped it out. Then they hot-wired it
from under the hood (ignition switch was not taken apart) and tried to
start it. The alarm disabled the fuel pump so they drained the battery
cranking it. Then they tried to tow it with the spoiler -- broke it. 
Next comes the best part.

I am guessing that they scratched their idiot heads for a long time 
looking for a tow-hook. When that train of thought didn't produce results, 
they put a tow strap through the front -- between the edge of the door and
the pillar, around the dash, below the steering column and out the other
end -- and tried to tow it! Bent the fender on the left and the right and
squeezed the dash at the 2 edges, but amazingly no switches, instruments
broken. Also took some paint off in a 2inch band from the fender all the
way through to the middle of the hood -- looks like it has a "V"
scratched on the hood now -- must have been some kind of a metallic
tow-strap. This was around when a security guard came by and they took
off. Somewhere in there they also managed to damage the right quarter
panel when they were maneuvering their car to get closer so now that has
deep scratches and has gone in a little bit.

When they called me at 4am I found the parking brake still engaged! And
they couldn't figure out why the car would not move. C'est la vie. 
Could have been worse. Use your alarms and parking brakes everybody --
don't get lazy.
