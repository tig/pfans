I'm shopping for my 1st Porsche and have decided on the 89-90 944 Turbo or
the '88 Turbo S.  Although Porsches are not common in Western Canada, I
found a Guards Red '89 Turbo with only 45,000 miles on it.  When I looked
into the history of the car, I found a problem with it I could use some
advice on.

This car has been in two accidents, but they were minor.  It was rear-ended
once, and hit in the driver's side door the second time.  The total
insurance claim for the two accidents combined was only about $3500, and
only body parts and painting were involved.  The most expensive part
replaced was the door skin.  As far as I can see, everything was fixed
right, looks straight and color matches.

Of course I would prefer a car with a totally clean history, but this car is
right in most ways, looks great and has been properly maintained with full
documentation, including a recent timing belt replacement.  It came from
California via Las Vegas (two owners before the dealership that has it now)
and there is no rust as far as I can see.

The dealership is asking a premium price based on the low mileage, expensive
stereo, and overall excellent shape of the car (it is very "clean", has new
rubber, immaculate interior, checks out mechanically, etc.).  The fact that
it is a red '89 Turbo makes it all the more valuable, at least in my eyes.  

The bottom line is, do you guys think an otherwise exceptional car should be
avoided because of the relatively minor body damage?  Could minor accidents
cause serious alignment problems?  

Thanks for your help.

Yours truly,
Dave
