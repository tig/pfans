I can only speak from autocrossing experience. The fastest stock car at
the PCA Parade last 2 years has been list member Bill Buetow in a 1989 S2.
In SCCA autocrosses the 968 and S2 and 993 are all about even with an
expert driver. 993 favours power courses (duhhh). S2 favours handling
courses and 968 is in the middle. Pre 993 911's and 951S don't have much
chance of beating any of these 3. On the race track is a different matter.

Oh its cool to beat 993' at PCA events (heh,heh,heh) in a S2 or 968. Heck
I can beat a 993 twin turbo if he's on street rubber and I'm on R tires.

Yep.

208hp (S2) vs. 236 and 207lb-ft vs. 225lb-ft. Basically the motors are the
same but 968 introduced Vario-Cam (kinda like Honda' V-tec). 968 is 88lbs.
heavier and has slight disadvantage in 2nd gear overall ratios. From 3rd
gear on the 968 will slowly pull away from a S2.
