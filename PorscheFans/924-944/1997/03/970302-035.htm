Hello all-
        I'm looking to buy a 944 Turbo in the very near future and I am
wondering if there is really that big of a difference between say, the 86 or
87 models and the 88 S & 89 models.  I'd like to race the car eventually,
but that might end up waiting a year or so, otherwise the car is just going
to be a semi-daily driver, but NOT a commuter car.  I used to drive my
fathers 86 944 Turbo regularly and really liked the car, but I haven't had
the oppurtunity to drive an S, which is why I'm asking for your much more
qualified opinions. ;)

The cost difference seems to be noticable in the "real world" whereas price
guides say that it is minimal.  Is the S option really worth what will
probably be over $3000 (American, for the international readers)?  Or is the
price wrong if there is that much of a difference?  How much should I expect
to spend on these cars?  86s seem to be around $7000 to $10,000, whereas
88S-89 are anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000, but all those $10k cars are on
the other coast! :(

Sorry for all the questions, I hope to get myself my car by the end of March
and any help is appreciated, as well as any pointers to 951s for sale near
Pittsburgh, PA!  Thanks!
