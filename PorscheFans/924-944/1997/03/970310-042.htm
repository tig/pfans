Well, well, well.  I don't know what to say, but all that spinning has made
me sick to my stomach.  It was an interesting day, actually a very fun day,
but an interesting one.

So, anyhow, we arrive at the site and get a nice and friendly welcome as
usual.  The track surface is wet, but it's very windy and it looks like
it might dry up so I decide to take off the streets and run the race tires.
Almost immediately after I changed the tires, a monsoon comes in.  It
felt like every piece of hail was trying it's best to break my satelite-
dish sized ears off, or that every gust of wind was trying to use my ears as
wings and launch my skinny bones body off the ground!  Finally, someone
was getting concerned that I might actually become airborne and protected
me by an umbrella.  This was at a time when I was trying to learn how to
do tech by Bill Buetow.  I even got to fail my first car (!) at this tech
session.

So, now the track is greasy as hell, the track has puddles all over it.  The
storm lasted for about 15 minutes.  Now, of course, no one likes to drive
3 hours to an event to drive in that kind of weather, but it's good
experience nonetheless.  At the driver's meeting, we found out that all
of us were in the first run group (and we thank BEAC for that) so we would
be able to leave pretty early and make our trip a little bit easier.

I was the first person up of the Canadian contingent.  I did this same
course last year, so I should do better than last year.  Yah right!  I ran
pretty conservative, but the car had zero traction.  Every time I got on
the throttle, the car would move sideways, I was literally driving a 
normally aspirated low-compression car.  In my first run, I spent more
time counter steering than real steering.  Not good!  My time was a 60.188
which wasn't all that bad.  Paul went up after me and spun his car in the
last 3rd of the course (the left hander over the hump).  Paul was the
first spin of the day.  Darren Foo went out next of our group and did what
we've all wanted to do at one time, spin in the first corner!  Yah, what a
way to start your day, first corner, a right hand sweeper, he turns the car
in and gets on the throttle, boost comes in and around he goes.  He comes
back with this "I did something wrong" look to his face.

In the next round of driving, I go out and turn into the first corner and
somehow found some traction so I stomped on the throttle, counter steered
and had way more speed coming into the hairpin.  Well, lots of speed coming
into a hairpin is a bad thing when you're running slicks in the rain,
I turn the car in to the hairpin, it starts to understeer, I get on the
throttle a bit (Bill Buetow said, steer with the rear, steer with the rear),
I spun really badly.  When watching it on the video, I actually almost saved
it, but the rear tires went into a puddle and that's when it almost accelerated
the spin.  Not good.  My time was a 78.803 with the spin and a missed gate.

Paul goes up and managed to run a good time, but I think he whacked a bunch
of cones.  Darren went up and I think he whacked a bunch of cones.

On the third runs for us, I went out and was flying through the course.  The
car seemed to just work that run.  I'm coming over the hump on the last
3rd of the course, I turn in, everything feels so good.  I spin.  How?  I
don't know, but a lot of people spun there (Paul included) so I'll just
blame it on something on the track :)  My time was a 66 with a spin.

Paul goes out and gets in a screamer run of 57.9 clean on street tires.
Cliff and Darren both whacked cones I think, with Cliff spinning (is that
right Cliff?).

Last run of the day, I took Glen (novice co-ordinator) for a boot.  I drove
very conservative and managed to come in with a clean 58.7 run on Hoosier
radials.  I didn't think that was bad at all considering the fastest car
of our group was a low 54 second (or was that high 53?) time in a 911
race car with Yokohama deep tread A032-R tires and I was literally driving
on slicks.  Paul went out and started to pendulum in the last slalom and
got a 59 second run.  Darren whacked a bunch of cones again I think
(correct me if I'm wrong Darren).

Anyhow, it was a fun event, a wet one at that.  I usually compare my times
to Bill, but the track was changing so much during the day.  With the
track a bit drier than when we ran in the first group, Bill ran a high
53, low 54 second time.  Later in the day, when it was close to 80%
dry, he ran a 51.?!!!  WOW!

Thanks to BEAC for allowing us to come out and thanks to Glen for assisting
me in my driving.

I should mention one thing about list members coming out to the events.  I'm
usually under a lot of pressure to drive so I may not be the most friendly
person you meet out there.  If you want to come for a ride, just grab a helmet
and ask.  Kerry came all the way out from Squamish to watch, so I made sure
that he got a ride, but another fellow whose name elludes me right now
came out to watch, but unfortunately, I don't know if he had a chance to
go for a ride.  It's unfortunate if he didn't, because I would have loved
to taken him for a boot or arranged for Paul or Darren to take him.  And Tom,
where were you???

My personal goal for the year is to come consistently within 3 seconds 
of Bill Buetow regardless of track setup or condition.  

Summary of times:
Paul Buchmann		~57.9	Yokohama AVS intermediate street
Farzaan Kassam	~58.7	Hoosier A3S02 race
Darren Foo		~66.0	Dunlop SP8000 street
Bill Buetow		~53.9 (about 70% the wetness as our run group)
Bill Buetow		~51.? (almost dry)

Bill, correct me if those times are wrong!

Also, a bunch of you guys asked specific questions in a digest a couple of
days ago, I will answer them when I get home.  The Hawk pads are working
quite well, really hard pedal, good feel, I'll give more details later.

Farzaan.
