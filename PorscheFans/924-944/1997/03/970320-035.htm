The oil cooler is located inside a water jacket, and is cooled by the
engine cooling water flow. This solution have two benefits and one
drawback. Oil is cooled, but not to much - and oil is (when driving with
low engine load) in fact heated by the water to working temperature. The
drawback is that it needs a more complicated setup, and if seals fail,
oil will usually enter the water from oil pressure being higher than
water pressure. Engine stopped, remaining water pressure may cause water
to enter the oil.
      
Water can enter the oil in at two ways on this car. One is the oil
cooler O-ring seals.   

However, this may not be the cause this time. I take it that 'winter
storage' means that there is 'winter' where you live. By running the
engine for a short time every 14 days there is a good chance that water
gets accumulated in the oil just by running the engine and not getting
it hot enough tto get rid of water buildup. 

Here's how: In a condensing athmosphere (winter, rain, damp, brrr...)
the inside of the engine will containg a fairly large amount of water
(from the air - naturally, and usually not a problem) and this water
gets mixed (sort of) into the oil. BTW, the ability to contain a little
water without harm is one of the design parameters for engine oil. On a
short run every 14 days the oil won't get hot enough to cook off the
water, instead it may accumulate. 10 minutes of idling will certainly
not be sufficient. Check this possibility before jumping to the other
(more expensive) theory - especially if you dont have oil in the cooling
fluid.

Things to look for is oil in the cooling water - brown froth in the
reservoir or just plain oil on the water  . Then, its almost certain
that the O-rings have failed. Another cause is a leak in the head gasket
- wich is not nearly as common.

When changing O-rings remember that a lot of measuring goes into the job
if the shimming is lost or confused. Those shims preload the o-rings -
and usually it's sufficient to keep them exactly the same. Loose them,
and you are in for tricky measurements.

Clean the groove for the outer gasket meticiously.     

This is really a job where the material is 10 bucks, and the work cost
100:s.
Haynes is a bit short on this issue - but really - it is not very
complicated.


Good luck.
