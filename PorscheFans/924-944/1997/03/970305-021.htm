Good Advice Mark,
I think these cars all require constant influxes of cash. I bought my 88
951 last summer for 12,500 with 44k miles and a complete history. Now I
figure I probably paid a thousand too much. Since the PO had done a water
pump clutch etc. in the last year or two I thought I would be fine. However
I have spent $700 on A/C $550 on a DME problem and now need to spend
another $600 on a water pump. I think that no matter how good a condition
the car is in, you can expect to spend a couple three grand the first year.
I beginning to suspect that every year will be that way. You know, an
endless cycle of water pump, radiator, oil cooler, CV joints, clutch,
steering pump, rack, A-arms, shocks, transmission overhauls. Makes it hard
to squeeze in an occasion upgrade. ;-( HOWEVER, these are such bargains
from a performance standpoint that the regular and expensive maintenance is
probably reasonable. ;-)

PS Tell me about your new dash. Mine is cracked horribly and I would like
to replace it.
