The easiest and cheapest way to improve your handling would be to put
on better tires. The stickier the tire, the faster you can take turns.
Simple as that. What tires do you currently have? What condition are
they in? How many miles are on them? If the tires are good, then I
suppose your shocks or some other suspension component could be the
culprit. However, before we start blaming the car, lets take a look at
the driver.

There are some techniques that will allow you to handle turns better.
You say you are keeing even acceleration until halfway through the
turn. Then what are you doing? If you're mashing the throttle down,
that's your problem. If you're lifting a little off the throttle
because you start running out of road, then that's probably the cause.
How about your line? You say you start and finish wide, and try to
hit the inside of the corner (apex). That's good. Are you really
doing that, or are you finding that as you reach the apex of the 
corner, you have to tighten the steering a little? If so, that would
definately cause the oversteer problem.

The proper technique for fast cornering is to slow down in a straight
line before the corner, slowing enough to allow you to accelerate
ALL THE WAY THROUGH the corner. As you start to turn in for the corner,
you release the brackes, and gently start to accelerate. The steering
wheel should be smoothly turned until you have car turned enough for
the corner. As you drive through the apex of the corner, and start to
unwind the steering wheel you should be able to apply more and more
throttle. If you find that you have to turn the car more after you 
have reached the apex, then your line was wrong, and you are going to
be in trouble.

Cornering is all about weight balance. If your rear wheels are sliding,
either there is too little weight on them, or too much load on them.
As you accelerate out of the corner, more weight is put on the rear
wheels, which allows them to handle higher loads, and you can drive
out of the corner faster. If you lift off the throttle in the middle 
of the corner because you find you are running out of road, the weight 
moves from the rear tires to the front tires, and the rear tires lose
traction, and slide. If you mash the throttle down in the middle of
the corner, you are putting too much load on the tires and they can't
handle the load without enough weight, so again they slide. 

I recommend heartily that you find the local PCA region and try
autocrossing. There will be nice people there who can explain this
stuff in person, and also check your car. This way you can find
out once and for all if there is a problem with you or the car.
Besides, you might like it!

There are a number of excellent books on the subject of driving. A few
of my favorites are "Secrets of Solo Racing" by PCA member Henry Watts,
and "Winning, a Race Car Drivers Handbook" by George Anderson.

Unlike me, those guys can actually write!

Good luck,

Usual Disclaimers - I might not know what I'm talking about.
If you try this stuff and kill yourself it's not my fault. I recommend
you learn about your car at an autocross or on the track. Don't
drive like a maniac on public roads.
