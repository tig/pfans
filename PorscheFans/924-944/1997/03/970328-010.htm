Hi,

I am very confused and hope you all can help me!
I am seriously considering to buy a 951 and trying to find a shop
for a complete checkup.  I already notice a few minor 
problems with the car. I then called Carlsen dealer and 
asked for a quote for a complete checkup.  However they 
told me I need to tell them what type of services had 
already been done with the car such as "when the car
had its timing belt changed, balance belt...etc" They also 
told me they don't know what to check unless I 
tell them exactly what to check???  After a long
conversation, he quoted me $160 dollars for checking
"brake, brake lines leak, compressions"   Sounds like
they can't tell me what's wrong with the car unless I tell
them what I think is wrong first.

I made a call to Bauer Porsche Repair and they quote me
~$100 for a complete checkup.  Sounds like they exactly
know what a complete checkup is.

Correct me if I am wrong, am I asking too much for
a complete checkup.  I just want some expert advice to
assess the car and find out if anything is wrong.  What
is the thing I need to look for?


Tom,
