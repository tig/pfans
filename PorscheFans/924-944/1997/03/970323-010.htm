Normally the 10A fuse should be connected to the battery, but as I didn't
find a way (didn't really look for it either :) to connect the stereo to
turn itself off automatically when removing the key from the ignition, *and*
be able to turn it on manually with the key out of the ignition (I think
this is the normal method of operation), I just connected the main power to
some wire on the ignition switch. Or did I? I'm not sure anymore (read
below, I'm starting to doubt my memory.) If you have a voltmeter, you can
measure the various wires coming from the ignition switch and see which one
is high when the key is in.

As for the CD changer, I connected this to the battery.  The way my stereo
works now is as follows: Without the key in the ignition, I can only change
CDs in the changer. If I stick the key in, the stereo immediately starts
playing from exactly where I left it, with the same settings for
balance/bass/treble etc. This means the stereo gets power even when the key
is out of the ignition, since the settings are not lost.. Hmm..  I obviously
must have wired the fused wire directly to the battery. Argh, I did this a
year ago, so my memory is fading..

I think you can use the same ones you have. If I'm not mistaken, 6" rims
(which I suppose you have?) can take tires as wide as 205. I have 15"/6.5"
with 185/45 in front and 195/50 rear. I don't think this combination is
legal though. (Don't blame me, I bought the car this way.. :) Anyway, the
owners manual has suggestions for alternative tire sizes. They list 205
tires as a possible upgrade, but I don't remember the height or wheel size
for these. If you don't have the manual I can find it out for you.

Does anyone know if my tire sizes will affect my speedometer readings much?
Is the speed measured at the rear or front wheels? If it is measured at the
rear wheels it shouldn't be too much, since the diameter is only about 5%
less than stock. (And the speedometer probably shows 5% less than the real
speed, so I should get a more _accurate_ reading.. :)

If it is measured at the front wheels though..  Hmm..
