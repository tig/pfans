requires the addition of the wastegate shim.  THAT part of the installation
was NOT easy, at least for me.  A nine year old exhaust system doesn't
disassemble easily.  How hard was it for you?  I take it that some chips
(Autothority) don't require the shim.  Can other list members verify this?
I also know that the Weltmeister chipset for the 88 951S and 89 951 include
a 'fuel enrichment' device, but who knows what it is? ( An adjustable fuel
pressure regulator ?)

That's right, the AutoThority chip does not require intallation of a
wastegate shim.  Rather they use a bleeder valve that can be installed in a
couple minutes.  The fuel enrichment Weltmeister uses is a different
non-adjustabel fuel pressure regulator.  AutoThority says their chips don't
need it.

drive the car slowly without thinking that I was bogging the motor.  The car
has much better around town driveability and feels more like a big V-8.  The
boost comes on immediately.  And it still has the big turbo rush when you
floor it. Ahhhhh!
