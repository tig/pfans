you should also check to see if the wires are still connected.  mine
came undone when i was working on something else the sender worked find but
the wires that go to the guage had come loose and one was not even
in the gauge at all

I think 944s run about ~3 when warm and 5 (near pegged) when cold... the
oil pressure sender has probably failed... ~$60 part right under the oil
filter with two wires sticking out... especially if it is blackish as if
covered in dirty oil sludge... I think I heard they develop internal leaks
and then fail...

I replaced mine, *poof* oil pressure gauge is flawless...
