     On my sunroof, with the ignition is position 1 and the button held 
     down, the 2 toothed arms withdraw from the sunroof, but the motor 
     doesn't stop.  What seems to happen is that when the toothed arms 
     "bottom",the slipping clutch on the motor operates and prevents the 
     gears stripping.  I don't know if this is the intended action.  If it 
     is, your problem may be that your slipping clutch is set too tight.
     
     Alternatively, I may have the same fault as you, and my lightly set 
     clutch is all that's saving my gears!
     
     It would be very interesting to know if other people's motors DO stop 
     when the arms withdraw.

Okay to keep this short:
     
The sunroof didn't work. Using the Workshop manual, the steps where followed. 
Everything works, the roof goes up and down. The problem: When you go to 
remove
the sunroof, the motor doesn't stop (while your holding the button), it keeps 
on going and strips the gears.
     
We tested the micrositches. Microswitch two works and switchs when it is 
supposed to. It just doesn't stop the motor. We replaced all the relays, even 
the one in the front and the switch with ones from a working 944. Still the 
motor wont stop when microswitch two triggers. Any ideas? We didn't have time 
to further test it. Does anybody know how microswitch two is supposed to stop 
the motor?
     
Thank you.
