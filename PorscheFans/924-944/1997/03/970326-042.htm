I think perhaps I should clear up a few things.  I'm not arguing the point
of whether or not a 944 or 951 is better.  I'm also not arguing the point of
which is harder to maintain.  It's a simple fact, the 951 is faster, but it
is a hell of a lot more expensive initially and in the long run due to high
maintainance costs.  That's all I said.  The reason that I blasted George
for his message was the fact that he was seriously lacking in tact when
dealing with someone new to Porsche.  A lot of true car enthusiasts are very
sensitive when it comes to other peoples reaction to their car, especially
when that person is considered an expert in their eyes.  If that person
tells you to sell the car if you want to go faster, that tends to make you
wonder if you ever should have bought it in the first place.  Point being,
all of these people turn to this list to attempt to learn from our
experience and possibly contribute some of their own.  These people take
another owners opinion very seriously.  Why discourage them to the point
that they will possibly sell their car and invest their money in another
marque?  I'm not just biching to hear myself talk.  We should all, myself
included, think about what we are saying and to whom it is being said before
we hit that "send" button.  I have seen some very poor behavior from a lot
of current owners that is very disturbing.  All I am trying to do is take an
active role in correcting this problem.  Someone has to.  I'm sorry if I may
have offended anyone, but facts are facts.  We have some jerks among us, and
if we don't try to change them, who will?
