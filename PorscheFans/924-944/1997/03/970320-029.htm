Dear PorscheFans,

My wife is the very proud owner of a very nice 1987 924S. She bought it in 
September 96 and drove it every day, rain or shine. It started fine and ran 
as smoothly as any car I've known. In mid November, she drove it to work and 
parked it in the parking lot. That afternoon, the temperature dropped below 
zero for the first time. In the evening the car turned over strongly, fired 
intermittently but would not start. My wife has had a long face ever since 
and I'm hoping one of you knowledgable people out there can answer a few 
questions for me.

First of all, I was told that this car has the same 2.5 liter engine as the 
944 and that I should be using the HAYNES 944 (83 thru 89) manual. Is this 
correct?

Secondly, I did all the standard checks; battery, cables, ignition system, 
fuel system and sensors. Everything checks out fine with one oddity. The 
manual says the air flow sensor should have 8 volts between terminal 9 and 
ground (earth) for a non-turbocharged engine. Now I'm pretty sure that this 
is a non-turbocharged engine but the air flow sensor has terminal markings 
of 1 2 3 4 and has 4.5 volts going to it. These are the specs of the 
turbocharged engine. The sensor looks relatively new (Bosch part# 0 280 202 
064). Could this be the wrong sensor for this vehicle? Could the manual have 
the specs backwards? 

Thirdly, the genleman from whom the vehicle was purchased said he had 
recently replaced the timing belts. I have read in PorscheFans emails that 
the belts need to be looked at again after a brief break-in period. Could 
this be contributing to the problem?

Lastly, I would appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have as my 
wife is getting spring driving fever and wants to get out on the road again.

Yours Truly,

Doug Bradshaw
