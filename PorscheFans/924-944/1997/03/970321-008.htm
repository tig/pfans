     Hi All,
        I have a question which would need to be answered by someone with 
     access to the wiring diagrams in the factory manuals...  This is for a 
     1986 944  last digits VIN GN459729.  
        When I turn the ignition to the on position, the warning lights are 
     supposed to come on, which most of them do.  The only ones that don't 
     are the low fuel and the overheating lights.  These are supposedly 
     supplied by a voltage in this "test" condition through some diodes, 
     and I would like to find out which diode(s) is/are powering these two 
     warning lights.  I have checked the bulbs, which are fine. I have 
     checked the print on the blue plastic, but find it difficult to trace 
     the tracks since there are so many connections, and because I know 
     that automotive electronics don't obey Ohm's law...  The Haynes really 
     isn't bad on the diagrams, but doesn't have the detail I need for the 
     instruments...
     
        Anybody with previous experience/answers??
     
     Cheers,  Jan
