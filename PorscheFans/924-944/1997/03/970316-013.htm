They probably do, to some extent.  My friends' Mazda 323 and Probe GT have
this problem too.  I guess it's dependent on how often you drive in rain.
(May also be dependent on regional climate and acid rain or UV exposure from
sunlight that would degrade the rubber blades.  Who really knows?)  Oh yeah,
a lot of Mercedes 300D's also do this.  So far, by mom's BMW 535i hasn't had
any wiper problems, though.  Could the chemical composition of the rubber
blade be a factor?  That might explain the vast difference between different
manufacturers' prices for wiper blades.
        Oh yeah, be careful about what kinds of cleaners you use on your
windshield (and be sure to wipe off all excess car wax and detailing
agents).  Overspray and residue might also be the culprit behind your
wiper's inability to sweep smoothly and maintain constant friction and
adhesion to the glass.
        Let me know what works if you are able to resolve this problem...
