I need some advice on chassis mods for my '86 951.  I recently took my
car to Santa Barbara and drove the heck out of it along the mountain
roads I used to terrorize when I called that city home.  The car was
amazing in that environment (much more fun than my friend's Kormann
modified '88 M3, which felt like a stiffly sprung front driver on those
same roads), however, I did sense some problems in the chassis balance.

The PO performed the following mods:  Eibach 250lb. front springs, 968
front anti-roll bar and Koni Sport shocks (the springs & bar have about
12,000 miles, the Koni's are of much older [and unknown] vintage).  The
car definitely needs added stiffness in the rear (although it
understeered much less than I suspected with so much done to the front
end), but I'm not sure which route to take -- springs, or a thicker bar?
 My concern really isn't a matter of too much understeer (although less
is definitely preferred), but rather a sensation when transitioning from
left to right that the rear is too soft and wallowy.  During this
transition, the front feels really tight and responsive, the rear
feels...slow.  I don't know if this makes sense, but I don't know how
else to describe it.

As a first step, I am going to check the rear shocks and see if they are
set at full stiff.  If they are not, I will adjust them in that
direction, but my question is what to do next.  I had originally planned
on replacing the factory rear bar with a Weltmeister this summer, but
now I'm not so sure.  Am I better off buying thicker torsion bars to
offset the stiffer front springs?  As a side note, when I push down on
either end of the car, the front feels STIFF, the rear, relatively soft.
 Oddly though, when I drive over a speed bump, the rear of the car feels
like the stiff end (even considering the fact that my butt is closer to
that axle).  Any opinions on what to do? 

Thanks,
John
