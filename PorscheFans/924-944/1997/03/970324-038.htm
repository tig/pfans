I really hope that you only mean "looked ok" in a figurative sense since it
is impossible to check the roller and tensioner bearings by sight.  In
fact, you must physically check for any play (radial or axial) or roughness
(or "clicking") in rotation.  There should be absolutely none.  This is
easiest to verify by removing the rollers and tensioners from the car.
Furthermore, the updated idler rollers have larger diameter ball bearings
(the gear still has the same size outside dimension) for improved
load-carrying capability.  Also, the seals on the original idlers and
rollers tend to let all the grease leak out and seal in all sorts of dirt
and grime as they age.  When I replaced my belts some months back, I ended
up replacing all the rollers and idlers for both belts-- they were *all*
bad and my car is approximately the same age as yours (although mine has
more miles).  The cost for all the rollers and idlers was something less
than $100, so it's definitely not worth ignoring.  Should one of those
bearings seize, well, it wouldn't be pretty.

Another note: if your car hasn't been updated to the newer-style pump (with
the larger diameter water pump pulley) and the belt deflector, now would be
the time.  This should be the case, but you never know.  Ask your
mechanic-- he should know without hardly thinking about it.

The timing belt does stretch as it wears, hence the need for a checkup
retension after about 3,000 miles or so.  But, it shouldn't squeal since
that's the sign of slippage.  The cause of the high-pitched squeal is much
more likely to be an under-tightened accessory belt (which are removed
during a belt change).  It's very easy to do and has nothing to do with
your timing belt.  Check that out first.  I find that my power steering
belt (being the narrowest) gave me the most trouble in terms of noise.  If,
for some reason, it really is your timing belt, the only place to slip
would be where it turns the water pump (everything else is gears).  If they
got grease on the belt or the water pump pulley, that would be enough.
Ditto for a leak (oil or water).

As a side note, last summer there was a seeming plague of broken bolts
which hold on the air conditioner and that would make the squealing noise
as well.

Could be just about anything, from motor mounts going bad, to the clutch
rubber center disintegrating, to something like a cylinder missing.  If it
wasn't there before, it might be related to the water pump change, but then
again, it might not.  If you're like me, you are probably more sensitive to
the car's performance right after something has been done, so you just
might not have noticed it before.

I've seen different opinions, but it would seem that this shouldn't affect
the car too noticeably, especially given your stated driving conditions.
Supposedly Porsche instigated the higher-temp thermostat to get better
emissions.  I have no idea whether this is factual or supposition.  As long
as the car isn't running into or near the red, I wouldn't sweat it (no pun
intended).

If your shop isn't understanding about your questions and concerns, you
might consider finding another shop.  After all, you're paying them a
substantial sum for their services and expertise.  Let us know what you
find out.
