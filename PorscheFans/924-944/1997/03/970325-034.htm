Answer to question posted by Andy Raye:

Andy - 
If the sunroof motor doesn't sound like it is really straining when the sunroof stops moving then you may have to adjust the motor clutch. Looking at the motor assembly you will see a hex bolt with a straight blade screw driver slot . This is also the 'manual' sunroof operator. on this bolt there is what looks like a lock nut that is only just accessible where it enters the motor assembly. This is the clutch adjustment nut tighten (clockwise) and you will tighten the clutch --DANGER!! Do not tighten more that a little at a time or will need to replace the plastic gear in the sunroof gearbox that is in between the latches. (not much fun) 
I am assuming that you have the usual 86 type motor, the 87 and later type sunroof system was actually added in late 86.

Since you can 'hand' assist the roof I don't think that your motor  or gear has a problem.
