Son's 1989 944 Turbo in my garage...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Can I borrow the keys dad?

Completely irrelevant aside:

I had a black '86 951 which I washed at least twice a week and waxed constantly.
At the time I was living home, working ull time, and going for my PhD.

My mother thought I was obsessive about the car, and couldn't
understand why I was always cleaning/washing/waxing.  Besides, I spent
WAY too much money on stuff like floor mats ($100+) and other
unnecessary items.  Can't you just get them at Pep Boys?"

In the last 13 years she has only put 52K miles on her S-10 Blazer.

She's about to retire, and has always wanted a Benz, having grown up
during the war in Germany, and always dreaming of buying "The only car
worth having". She looked at a few and then stated "A Benz should be
Black!"

In January, she said "Find me a nice car".  After a long search, we
narrowed it down to Black 190E 2.6, 93 model, of which we found SEVEN
on our first day looking in the DC area, about 2 hours away.

She ended up getting a 1993 with a camel interior.  38K miles, with 
factory chromed wheels...ABSOLUTELY mint.

She now drives places for no apparent reason, washes the car constantly
(or gets me to), buys silly things like $40 stainless steel fron
liscence plates, and for easter, she got som MB factory "all weather
mats" from Lyd and I ... about $70 for rubber.  She already had the
expensive logo carpet mats, they came with.

Yes, she has a MB Key-fob, and will no doubt get pens, hats,
sweat-shirts, etc. and is now almost persuated to join the MB club.

Living proof that parents learn from children.  I think we understand
each other now.

My wife drove a Probe when I met her.  Now the Audi V8 Quatto is an
absolute necessity, and she can barely stand it when it's in the shop
and she has to drive a loaner.  She can't seem to explain what she was
thinking when she bought that $17K (mazda) Probe new!
