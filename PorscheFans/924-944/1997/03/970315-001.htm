 I've been lurking around this list for a few months now, enjoying the great
wealth of information and stories that everyone shares. Finally, I've got two
quick problems to get input on...
 First, a little background. I've owned an early '85 944 for almost 3 years
now. The car has 58,000 miles on it, and the only money I've had to put into
it are new belts and motor mounts.
   I just put in the throttle response cam advertised in Performance
Products, and I'm having a little problem deciphering the instructions
included. While I managed to correct the cable "slack" so that the throttle
fully closes with the clicking sound they describe, they also mention
adjusting a plastic screw under the accelerator pedal that acts as a stop.
Their instructions state that "This stop must be screwed out until the
throttle pedal hits the screw just as the throttle fully closes." If
anything, shouldn't the pedal hit the screw when the throttle is fully open?
Are they basically just saying to extend the plastic screw coming out of the
floor until the pedal hits it when fully depressed? 
  The second problem concerns my windshield wipers. Basically, whenever I
turn on the car, the wipers activate themselves. No matter what position the
lever is in, the wipers turn on. Using the turn signal also seems to trigger
wiper movement.  Sometimes, the wipers aren't a problem at all, and even when
it does happen, it usually stops after a few minutes. Any ideas?

 Thanks in advance for any help  -  this list is great!
