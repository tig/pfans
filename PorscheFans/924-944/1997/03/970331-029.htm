The 944 belt should have a twist in it so the inside edge is not resting on
your neck and chaffing.  Many other manufactures have this reversed and the
edge cuts into your neck.

When the seat belt is fully retracted and you slide the buckle to the top
of the belt strap, the buckle should face the door pillar and there should
be a 1/2 twist in the belt between the buckle and the floor if all is right.

When you pull the belt across you, the lap portion should have no twists,
but the shoulder strap should have the twist I mentioned above.

Once you get used to it you will think anyone that does it different is
silly.  This way is far more comfortable.  In fact, I think that Porsche
makes the most comfortable belts I have ever worn.
