     I haven't heard much on the list about the importance of regular 
     inspections of ball joints on the aluminum control arm cars.  Ball 
     joint failure DOES HAPPEN ON STREET CARS WITH STOCK SUSPENSIONS. Ball 
     joints can degrade quickly and probably wont be noticed simply by 
     driving the car.   A complete failure could be catastrophic. 
     Especially since it would happen under a heavy load--exactly when you 
     do not want your suspension to become partially detached. 
     
     I was quite surprised this weekend to find that in the period of three 
     months my right ball joint had gone from 0.1" free play to over .25".  
     I thoroughly inspect put the car on a lift at least every three months 
     while doing oil changes or other maintenance so I consider myself a 
     very attentive owner. The car is an 86 951 with 80k miles and a stock 
     (until this weekend) suspension. The car has led a fairly easy life. 
     The left arm was replaced last year so I expected the right would 
     follow shortly. Still, the car handled nicely and there were no signs 
     of such a dangerously warn part.
     
     To read the FAQs it sounds as though failure is unlikely unless the 
     car is track driven and/or lowered. I wanted to reinforce the fact 
     that this is not necessarily the case. Also, ball joints must be 
     checked carefully. You cannot tell by hand that a ball joint is worn, 
     it takes a carefully positioned pry bar or large screwdriver will a 
     fair amount of force to overcome the tension of the sway bar.
     
     Anyway, I hope this helps someone prevent a serious accident.
