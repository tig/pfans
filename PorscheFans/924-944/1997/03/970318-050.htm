Both have the 3.0 liter engines, but the 968 has Variocam, which is some
sort of variable inlet-timing system that advanced timing of the inlet cam
to overlap inlet and exhaust valve opening to improve torque in the
midrange.  968's are also supposed to have better resonant inlet manifolds,
lighter pistons and forged con-rods, less restrictive catalyst and exhaust,
in addition to enhancements to the engine management system of course.
        The 944 S2 has around 208 hp @ 5,800 RPM, but the 968 makes 236 hp
at 6,200 RPM.  Torque rose from 207 lb-ft @ 4,100 RPM to around 221 lb-ft at
the same engine speed.  0-60 mph for the S2 was 6.7 seconds, and only 5.9
for the 968.  Tiptronic 968's did 0-60 in mph in 7 seconds.  The S2 ran the
1/4-mile in 15.2 seconds, while the 968 did it in 14.4; Tiptronic in 15.1
seconds.  Both top speeds are very similar (S2: 152 mph vs 968: 156 mph; 153
mph with Tip), and I guess the styling enhancements on the 968 didn't really
help as much as the extra power in this respect, since both are supposed to
have CD's of .34 anyway.
        A major difference between the 2 cars that can affect their
performance differences are the transmissions (transaxles, whatever) offered
with each.  I know the 968 got a 6-speed.
        I'm not too knowledgeable on the different handling/Sport packages
available on these 2 cars, but I remember that the 968 had some Sport
package that also included 17-inch wheels that I don't think was offered on
the S2.
        I may be mistaken in quoting some of these figures or in making my
comparisons, so I welcome any corrections from those of you with more
experience with these vehicles.  Hope this gives you an idea of how the
944S2 "stacked up."
