Hey Darren, how do I get in on this? Cost?

Was this the parts guy or service rep? Sounds like they don't know
anything.

I believe it's 1/8 of the total distance between low and full, above the
full mark. Which is 1/8 x 1.5L = approx. 200ml. The owner's manual


says to wait a few minutes after shutting off the engine before taking a
reading.

Pretty much stock means?
You should physically check the control arms before the event for cracks
and ball
joint condition and bushing slop. Preferably with enough lead time to get
them fixed if you find a problem.
