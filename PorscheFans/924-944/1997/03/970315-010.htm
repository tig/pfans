From: John Gifford
I recently purchased a 85.5 944 with several small (?) problems, not the
least of which is a non functioning heating-A/C control system. I've got
a copy of Hayne's 944 manual, but the wiring diagram leaves a lot to be
desired. The basic problem is the heater is on all the time, full force.
If I remove the vacuum check valve at the connection at the brake
booster, the recirc vanes in the fan close and the water valve in the
heater line closes, shutting off the heater. According to Hayne's, these
two items are controlled by the combination of vacuum and elecrical
controls sent from the interior thermostat to the solenoids, but it
appears that they don't know that. In addition, the slide controls for
the defroster and footwell dampers don't change the position of the
dampers. I've checked all the usuals, fuses, wires, grounds, etc., but
haven't had any luck isolating the problem. If anyone has had a similiar
problem and/or knows where I can get better info on the controls, I'd
appreciate a note.

Thanks, 
John
