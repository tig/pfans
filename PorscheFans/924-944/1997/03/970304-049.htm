<< 
 does anybody knows if there is a seal kit to rebuild the Front caliper
 on my Turbo 89. The pistons are fine but the dust seals are cracked. I
 find it very expensive to change the Pistons and the seal just for this
 small job. The car has 29K km on it. 
  >>
I chased this problem, literally all over the world. No one will sell you
just the dust seals, only the whole kit which includes seals, pistons and
dust caps. I checked with Brembo directly and their answer is that their
units, as sold to Porsche, are proprietary and they will not sell parts.
Neither will Porsche. I talked to people in England and Italy also and got
the same answer. Consensus seemed to be - Don't need to replace the dust
seals unless the calipers are leaking. I haven't had intact dust covers for
three years and nothing is leaking. Of course my car is used primarily for
track events so they are carefully inspected on a regular basis.
