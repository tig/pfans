Hello Porschefans,
I'm feeling a little like a carnival huckster, selling off pieces of my
ex-944 this 
way, but I promise -- this is the end of it!  If I can sell some of this,
I'll be looking to BUY some of YOUR stuff for the Turbo S!

I have a 14mm rear anti-sway bar, including all mounting hardware (droplinks,
bushings, mounting brackets, spring plate mounting bolts, etc) for sale for 
$60.
This would be a great setup for someone who's 944/924S came without a rear
anti-sway bar, since it includes everything you'd need to mount it up in
about 
a half  an hour.  It's hefty enough to noticeably reduce the inherent
understeer 
of the stock front-bar-only setup, but not so beefy that it makes the car
tail happy.  For comparison, the Turbo S has a 16mm rear bar; the Weltmeister
is 22mm.
Speaking of Weltmeister, you'll note in their ads that you need to buy an
adapter
kit for their rear bar if your 944 doesn't already have a rear bar.  That
adapter
kit, which sells for at least $75, contains the mounting components I'm
offering
here.  So, if you decide to go for even bigger bars in the future, you'll
still be ahead!
Let me know if you're interested -- I hate to see it just hanging around the
garage. 
Kevin B
