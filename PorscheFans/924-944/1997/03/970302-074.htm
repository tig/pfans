>A question to those who have driven both of the above mentioned or similar
models.  How would you compare them in terms of driving pleasure?<

I had the pleasure of being in both this weekend.  I drove the S2 for two days
at PCA driving school and rode with my instructor in his turbo.  I also own a 87
951 that is having a transplant. The cars are similar but different and it
depends what you want out of a car.  The S2 is more drivable on the street and
has a ton of mid-range torque.  The 951 has less mid-range power and has turbo
lag, but once you get the rpms up, it is a rocket.  If you are into power, get
the 951.  The S2 is a great car on the street and at the track but it will not
make you wet your pants like the turbo.  

Once Porsche owners get comfortable with their cars, the majority start
searching for the elusive and expensive, "more power".  My friend with the S2 is
constantly trying to wring a few more hp out of his with dollars.  The friend
with the turbo put in a set of chips and left the rest stock and is happy with
his.  Of course, he has a fast 914-6 track car to make the adrenalin flow.

I personally would have both if my kids were not being selfish by insisting on a
college education.  The S2 to drive to work and tool around town with.  The
turbo to light up those two lane highways with slow trucks and to cruise the
freeways with.

Tough choice, wish it was mine.
