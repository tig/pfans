dear fellow members:
I have done everthing possible to correct a overheating problem,
thermostadt, waterpump, all belts.
The gauge still shows at the highest white notch on my 944 turbo.
and the fans seem to be on all the time even when i turn on the ignition, I
wonder if the fan control is tied to the temp gauge??
Any way the temp gauge seems to bounce around, as it might indicate a bad gauge,
has anyone attempted to replace on and how much trouble is it going to be, I
just also put a alternator in the car and it wasnt easy but not to bad at
all,(it came out from the top) the book says to take it out from the bottom!!!
if i slap the dash the gauge goes down for a while, but in chgo it is ok for
now but it is going to be summer soon .
I also suspect the fan control is either pluged in backwards ( i dont know
it this is possible) or maybe just that it went bad,, HELP!!!!!!!
