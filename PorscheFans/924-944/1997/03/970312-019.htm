Part 2/2

This is what finally worked for me and was recommended by long time MM
users:

1. Drag brakes for 1 mile on highway, let brakes cool, drag again for 1 mile,
   let brakes cool, do it one more time.
2. Slowly slow down from highway and go down empty side street.  Get up to
   60mph and firmly slow down.  Repeat this 10 times.
3. Go up to 60mph and brake hard activating ABS, etc.  

If the ABS activates and the car stops fast, you've broken them in right,
if the pads just slide, you've done it wrong.

The Hawk pads I'm trying right now are really something else.  I can't seem
to brake as smoothly though so they may not work out for me for auto-x
use, but MAN DO THEY STOP.

It should be fkassam@direct.ca  I haven't heard of my ISP having any problems.

It doesn't matter which thermostat you have because it's faulty anyhow.
Get a new 80C thermostat and you'll have nice heat again and a proper
running car.  My car was just like yours when I first got it, it never
got warm when I got to work, I was freezing my butt off.  When they changed
the thermostat, all was nice then.

I used to do a lot of work on my previous car (maybe that's why it was
always breaking), so when I bought this car, I decided that I wouldn't
do anything but small work, the rest I'd pay someone to do.  It's 
unfortunate, but I just don't have time as you can see by the number
of emails I send out ;)

I was just doing preventative maintenance.  I don't tolerate leaks, period!
The oil cooler seals are actually for an oil/coolant manifold as someone
was nice to point out for me on the turbo models.  It just prevents that
oil/water mixing thing.  When my oil got frothy in the winter from driving
short trips, I took it as a message from the car gods to do the update :)

Ok, hope you haven't fallen asleep by now and I apologize for such a long
post, but I'm on the digest and thought I'd save the header space.

I installed pads by myself and was quite proud.  It's real easy on these
cars, really, really easy.  I installed the Hawk pads and found out some
interesting things about my old pads.  My rear's were Textar pads!  I love
these Hawk pads, they are hard as rocks when you stand on the brake, have
tons of feel, stop like crazy when hot, but I keep activating ABS even with
slight pedal pressure when hot.  I'm gonna give them some time to get
a better feel for them, but I can't seem to modulate them well enough to
make them work for me in auto-x.  On the street, these are stunning for
those panic stops.  If I can't get the hang of their all or nothing stopping
power, I will try a new, full set of Metal Masters again.

Also, I got an alarm installed in conjunction with the factory unit.  I'm
really happy with the install.  Ralph's Radio in Vancouver, B.C. did it.
The installer's name is Jim.  Total cost was C$580.  I wrote up a whole
sheet on what I was hoping they could do and they pretty much met all the
goals.  The car has no external sign of having this alarm (which is what
I wanted as wierd as it sounds).  The remote is a very nice unit with a good
tactile feel (yes, feel matters now that I have a Porsche).  It uses the factory
blinkers and will set off the factory alarm too when it goes off.  I'm using the
silent arm mode so it looks like a factory alarm.  The alarm is a VSE Raptor.

Hint of the week: when changing the side marker lights, turn the steering wheel
outwards to get into the flap (it took me about 1/2 hour to figure out how
to get the flap open with the tire in the way (I turned it inwards and squeezed
my hands in the flap and cursed like crazy before it dawned on me to turn
it the other way)).

Farzaan.
