Ladies and Gents, a couple of "low-end mechanic" questions on my '83 944
(108K, no mods, daily driver):

o       Car seems to have good steering responsiveness BUT doesn't hold
direction well when driven over bumps or seams in the highway. Wants to
take off for the "wild blue yonder" particularly when the seam is in the
same direction as the car is travelling. Alignment? Shocks?

>  A 4 wheel allignment won't hurt, but I had same problem with my '89 944S2, 
but not my '84 944.  Problem is the fat tires, once the road is uneven, it 
pulls.  Nothing to be done.  But if you have stock tires, I'de go for the 
allignment.   You can check the shocks by pushing down on each corner and get 
the car bouncing.  If it doen't stop bouncing real quick, then the shocks need 
to be looked at.

o       Am going to replace the shocks on this car as I have no idea when
it was done last. OEM OK or should I go for the expensive ones? Plan to do
the work myself... recommendations?

> The fronts area bit more difficult and expensive.  The rears, get stock, shop 
for price are cheap (about $100) for a set.  A real easy do-it-yourself job for 
the budding shade tree mechanic.   Should take under 2 hours.

o       Have a couple of dash gauges which appear flaky... as well as a
fuel gauge illumination light which works one day, doesn't the next.
Suspect wiring problems (ground). Is it tough to get to the gauges and
wiring harness behind the dash?

> Never had problem with my '84, and the '89 dash is very different.  But lots 
of 

o       Need new tires this spring. Recommendations? I normally put
1000mi/month on this car in all kinds of traffic and weather.

> Yokahama AVS intermediate.  or if you want to save a couple bucks the 
Yokahama 509s

o       Carpeting is worn. Noted Tweeks' has a replacement carpet kit for
the 944. Anyone have any experience? Good value?

> Never done it.  Try George B at (800) ALL-P944 and ask him about some used 
carpeting, might match better.

o       Clutch will have to be replaced soon. Understand this is a tough
job... but can it be done in the garage with the car on jackstands or does
it have to be done on a full lift? Any special tools?

> Many have done it on the floor.   A LOT easier without the Turbo that most 
guys have to go through.  There is lots on the site about doing it.  Not an 
easy job, not an impossible one either.

I have another car to drive while I'm working on this so I expect to do it
a stage at a time, in an orderly manner. I can afford the time to learn!
Please note I am neither building a racer nor a concours car... just want a
pleasant day to day driver. I am not a great/professional mechanic but I
can always fall back on my son, who is both ... but I have to endure his
smirking!

> Buy the factory manuals.  Buy the haynes manual.  The list will help!
