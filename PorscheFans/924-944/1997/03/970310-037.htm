Yes, you're correct.  The wastegate shim was part of the installation.  All
this happened when I had about $3,000 worth of work done to the car,
including a new exhaust manifold!  The chip installation, pricewise, seemed
like only a footnote to the rest of the work!

I had heard that some shops recommend "strengthening second gear" when
doing the chip, but I'm not clear exactly what this procedure entails.
Anyone know?  I never had it done.
