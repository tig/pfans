Briefly scanning the list, it looks like I spent about $5,000 the first six
years, (clutch & other non warranty items) with the balance over the last
four years. I must say that my car seems to have had every malady known to
944's in general, and some of them more than once. My son has an '89 944 and
has spent very little for repairs on it. Except for the clutch, most of the
problems I have had are not 951 specific problems, but seem to be typical
944 problems. I would also note that the '89 seems to be a better car
generally than the 87 was.
