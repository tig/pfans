I'm hoping someone can allay my fears.  I spent some quality time 
beneath my car today, intending to investigate my shop's claim that I 
need my clutch master & slave cyl.'s replaced.  I figured I'd at least 
find some moisture somewhere.  The master seems OK.  No wetness on the 
cabin side and dry as a bone around the master cylinder.  Next I put the 
car on jackstands & looked at the slave.  Interesting stuff.  The slave 
is COMPLETELY dry.  My starter, however, was soaked.  Hmmmmm.  I thought 
if the slave or one of its connections were leaking, it would be wet and 
would leak on the starter.  The wetness on the starter, though, turned 
out to be motor oil.  It leaks from the oil pan gasket right above the 
steering gear housing and, on the pass. side, right above the drain 
hole.  Question #1 is this; when ought one begin to consider a (very 
costly) new oil pan gasket installation?  I'm not losing an amount of 
oil that I can't keep up with; amount 1/2 quart per 1000 miles.  I keep 
my oil level at the full mark when ice cold.  This translates to a third 
between low and full when nice and warm.  Should I keep a watchful eye 
and bide my time?  I'm concerned because I'm fond of 1000 mile 
excursions and I don't want to get stranded away from my mechanic.

Secondly, I found something else.  I've started to hear my steering 
components workin the past couple weeks.  While poking around today I 
discovered a rubber hose on the steering rack which goes from one end, 
inboard of the boot, to the other, also inboard of the boot.  The 
connection on the driver's side is broken free and there was steering 
fluid wetness on the surrounding metal; enough to make a 3/4" spot on 
the driveway.  My hunch is that this hose conducts fluid from one side 
of the rack to the other as it is forced during turning.  The fluid 
level in the reservoir was just above the low mark; not out of control.  
However, if much hunch about the hose's function is corrrect, couldn't 
the break introduce air into the system?  Any experience?  Does anyone 
know if I could replace this hose all by itself?  And for how much?

Thanks for any help.
