I have recently put a set of the Dynamic European Technologies (713
661-2780) control arms on my 89 Turbo.  Since the Turbo has the M030
bushings I had to send the arms in first, but Eric repaired both arms with
a one day turn around at $149.00 each.

Eric guarantees his work on street or track for 3 years.  I am satisfied
with his work.  He also supplies Tweeks with their rebuilds.  Tweeks has
been very happy with his work with zero returns to date.
