who claims them to be a lemon, that guy who hit water and is mad that
Porsche won't replace his head? That's a lemon owner, not car... I did the
same thing to my Scirrocco- result: cracked head most every time...

the maintenance is pretty high and regular... the cars are all 8-14 years
old and as Joe Danvers says, "the Porsche 944 is not a Volkswagen, it is a
racing car."

tolerances and the design in general is not like a daily commuter...
however, you do get great traction around curves while winding out 3rd gear
and if you loose that traction, you still have a fighting chance... so fun!

basically, I can afford the maintenance, but I don't want to... I am not
wealthy or close to it (I'd be on the 911 list! not blasphemy, just first
love)... I'm starting to get into doing the work myself... I have access to
a beater to drive around while the 944 is on stands and I go buying tools
every few weeks or so to the dismay of my girlfriend who seems to think cut
and dying flowers have some kind of value on this planet...

I told somebody the other day, if a noise develops, you can't run to the
shop every time... you won't eat very well...

my story may be typical... I started by replacing hoses last summer, that
lead to bleeding the cooling system, kinda wierd process, which lead to my
getting ready to replace rotors/pads/lines on the brakes... I replaced the
oil pressure sender, and then, well, oil in the coolant refocused my
attention real quick, and now I'm getting ready to do the holy oil cooler
seals/balance-cam belt replacement...

a tip, spend a lot of time cleaning the car... I cleaned the wheels and
wells last week, got a good chance to examine the suspension and brake
parts... cleaning gives you a cleaner car to work on, but also gives you a
chance to spy on all the parts and think about how everything works in a
non-pressure setting...

I'll spend money on special tools, errant or destroyed parts, I destroyed a
distributor rotor ($30) and a pressure sender ($65) first time out... so I
won't save money- YET! but when armed with the tools/knowledge I figure I
can keep owning Porsche cars without screwing up the rest of my life...

final tidbit, if you're going into this for the first time, I'd but a
normally aspirated 8 valve 944... they are plentiful (almost common?) and
priced right... that's what I have, and though I really want a turbo or an
S2 or a 968, I'm gonna wait until I see if I can do any of this labor
before buying one, many parts are much more expensive on the hotter
models...
