13 years ago I moved to Florida from New York, people always ask Why? the
weather? the opportunity to get run down by a blue hair in their rush to be
at the food store as soon as it opens? business opportunity? NO NO NO  I
moved here for days like yesterday, day 1 at October Fest at Sebring. The
Porsche GT1 cars are rolling and to watch and here them is now added  to the
list as to why I moved to Florida, pretty high on the list. The factory cars
where there also a couple of private teams, Rohr for one, what a rush to see
the full force of Porsche factory involvement. In addition to the Porsche
cars there are works MER. Benz. cars, Panos which look like Vipers that had a
bad childhood in a rough neighborhood, and loads of 911s in all classes, GT1,
GT2, GT3, plus BMWs, mazda RX-7 in GT2, et al. Just a word on some changes to
the Sbring track and what seems like a new approch by SportsCar owner A.
Evans. New grand stands, bleachers, facing main straight, not bad but pit row
wall blocks sight view of cars when they are in pits, $10 to bring in your
own cooler, $10 to park your car, this new ownership is going to try and and
make some money at this, I have mixed feelings right now but will wait and
see if changes help racing which for me is the only way to judge if they are
for the good or not. Its 6AM and I am off to the track for day 2, if the list
is interested will keep you posted through the weekend, anyone else going ?,
 would like your opinion on event and changes. 
yours in Porsche
