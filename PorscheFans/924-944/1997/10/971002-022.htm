Hi all,
So often we hear about a bad experience from mail order houses (Tweaks, 
Vertex, etc) , I believe we also need to recognize any good experiences.

I was originally going to order a car cover from Tweaks (Thank Goodness 
I Didn't) when I came across an ad from don Mcgill in excellence. I 
ordered a 3 layer Porsche original car cover which includes a storage 
bag, cable and lock for $87.95, and because I spent over $50 get the 944 
Parts and Technical Reference catalog absolutely FREE  (the same one my 
local dealer wanted to charge me $25.00 for a used one). I also ordered 
a part I did not know the part number to ( you know...the black widget, 
at the end of the silver thingy) and the salesman (Keith) was not only 
courteous and friendly, but also knowledgeable and patient as well. 
Granted, I haven't received my shipment yet, and I do not now what their 
return policy is, but I certainly feel more confidence in a vendor and 
their product when spoken to in a courteous & professional manner.

Porschefans is not only a terrific resource, but a large and powerful 
purchasing agent as well. Think about this...at 1000 strong, if each one 
of us ordered a clutch kit at say, $400 (as if that's all we would need 
: )...you're talking $400,000. This list not only helps each and every 
one of us every day, but collectively can send a very powerful message 
to those that rely on OUR business.
