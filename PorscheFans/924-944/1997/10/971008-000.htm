***sorry for the repost but I didn't get the confirmation like I usually
do***

I got the new updated waterpump installed.  I bought new belts and all new
rollers.  I have the belts and rollers installed and the timing is perfect.
 I rotated the engine clockwise one revolution and reset the position to
TDC.  Then I rotated the engine couter clockwise about 10 degrees or 1.5
teeth on the cam sprocket.  I postioned the tension tool between the cam
sprocket and crank sprocket as close to the middle as I could.  I set the
tension on the cam belt to 4.  I rotated the engine clockwise one
revolution again to TDC, then backed it off 1.5 cam teeth ( ~10 degrees)
couterclockwise and check the tension.  It was about 3.9 - close enough.  

Then I set the balance shaft belt to 3.  I turned the engine one revolution
clockwise to TDC, then back it off couterclockwise 1.5 cam teeth and
rechecked - 2.8 - again, close enough.

Have I done this correctly?  Also, what position is the balance shaft idler
supposed to be in?  It is the one smooth one with the oval hole above the
lower balance shaft.  I set is about 2-3mm away from the balance belt
running above it.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  I probably won't actually start the
engine until I read some responses.

Thanks to all,

Regards,

Michael Belfoure  (belt tensioning virgin and scared as one too doing it
for the first time)   : )
