<< I am looking for advice from folks who use their 944 during the winter. Up

 here in Vermont, we have snow and ice on the roads in the winter. As such,
the 
 local road crews salt the roads, and occasionally spread sand on really icy 
 days.  Why do I ask about this? My wife and I own an '87 Jeep cherokee that
we 
 drive in the winter, we are considering selling the Jeep and trying to find
a 
 cosmetically challenged (ie. cheap) 944 for winter use. I really don't want
to 
 use our '85.5 944 in the winter since they salt the roads in this area and
it 
 is rust free top, bottom, inside and out. Any suggestions? What tires do you

 use?  >>

Ezra,
I drove my 85.5 daily for six years in upstate NY (Albany area).   I'd put
Blizzaks on the track wheels and the car was a joy to drive in the slippery
stuff.   Only problem I ever encountered was with ground clearance after a
heavy snow, before the plows came through.
Also, the galvanized shell stood up well to the tons of road salt they spread
around here -- no rust anywhere on the car.
If I were you, I'd use the 85.5, or get something else that's cheaper to
maintain as a winter beater.
