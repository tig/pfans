This is the first time that I have posted on this board, so I hope that
I am doing it right. Basically here is my situation. I have LOVED
Porsches from the first moment that I knew what they were, but have
never owned one for one reason or another. Now, I can afford an
inexpensive "project car" and found something in the local paper that
caught my eye. It is a 1980 924 Turbo(931) for $1000.00 obo. I haven't
had the chance to look at it yet, but according to the person on the
other end of the phone, it has a nice body with good paint and the
interior needs a little work, but is decent. It has a 5sp, and according
to him, needs a clutch slave cylinder(probably a master cylinder as
well) and there is also a problem with were the exhaust manifold
connects to the turbo that is extremely noisy(I would assume that this
problem is also causing a problem with back pressure). Basically. I just
want someone's opinion on whether or not this would be a worthwhile
project. I would be on a very limited budget, with minimal tools.
Although I could buy what I needed. Thanks very much in advance.
Justin.
