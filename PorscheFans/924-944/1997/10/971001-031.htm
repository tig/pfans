Hi P-fans,

Okay, I can't resist.  I've seen a few postings on 944 clutch 
replacements. . . here's my (horror) story:

I'm of average mechanical ability and have an "average" number of 
tools.  My 83 944 needed a new clutch, so I thought, "no problem."  The 
local garage quoted me 10 hours plus $1200.  So I figured 20 hours 
and $800.  

Everything was fine (per the Haynes manual) until I hit the speed 
sensors located on the top/back of the block.  The bell 
housing was loose and ready to come off, but it was hung up by the speed 
sensors.  I tried EVERYTHING to get them off.  I ended up dropping 
the engine enough to access the bracket that held the sensors, breaking a 
few minor parts along the way.  In the end the job cost me $1000 and 
six months!  That's six months of working a couple of hours on the weekends, 
not straight through :-).  If I had it to do over again, I would 
still do the clutch job myself anyway!!  I learned a lot about the 
car and myself.  Its great understanding how the mechanicals work.  
Just factor in some more time.  Oh by the way, it took a vice, 
hammer, and punch to finally get the sensors out of the bracket :-)
