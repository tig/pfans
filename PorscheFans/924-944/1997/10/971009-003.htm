Subject: WTB: 85.5 944 AC compressor

The bearing is going out and it probably wont be long before the rest
goes. Does anyone know if it's easy to rebuild a compressor or cheaper
to buy a used one?=20

Hi Douglas,
	I am having the same problems with the Compressor in my car.  While I =
was trying to make up my mind on what to do I had left the car in the =
Garage.  There is this nasty noise that was coming from the Compressor =
so I tried not to drive it.  One day in desperate need of transportation =
I took the car out only for the compressor to Seize on the trip... =
Really Dumb on my part.  So I Garaged it again and I have searched all =
over.  My compressor is not a rebuild possibility and not even a =
candidate for getting a core charge back.=20
	The local Porsche guy wanted $680 to put a "clutch" on the compressor  =
so the car would run, but the Ac would not work... Or $860 for a rebuild =
unit and installation.  Back to the garage.  Talked to allot of people =
selling used and rebuild units.  I should be getting the part in the =
next few days and will get it in the car this weekend.  If all works =
well I will tell you where I got it.  I paid $180 for this one... Big =
gamble, but lets see what happens.  Tell you about it Next Week.
