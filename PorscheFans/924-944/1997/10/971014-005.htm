Greg Dowd,

I doubt very seriously if the shop still has your original line sitting
around unless of course there was in fact nothing wrong with it.  But in
that case, you'll be told they already disposed of it because they plan on
using it again.

I would be very leary of taking my car to someone who tells me what's wrong
without even looking at it or doing some sort of diagnosis.  

Just my opinion.  Hope you get things settled to your satisfaction.



On the subject of my "Dying 944", I spoke with the mechanic last night and I
will have my baby back this weekend.  I was starting to have severe
withdrawal symptoms.  Turns out my alternator was fine, only problem was the
DME.  I'm getting that fixed as well as timing belt "maintenance" and I'm
coming away with some spare change left.  Not much, but some!!!

When will the list get back to normal?  Receiving it on a daily basis,
instead of having to read the archive.

Roxanne
