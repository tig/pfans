As far as aftermarket timing belts go - my first thought is that Porsche
doesn't manufacture them themselves.  They provide specifications to
manufacturers and I'd be willing to bet the mfg with the lowest bid wins.
I just bought new timing belts today and they're made by Goodyear.  I
bought them from Automobile Atlanta and these are the same belts they use
in their shop.  I may be hesitant if they were stamped Taiwan (no offense
to anyone from there), but Goodyear has a pretty good reputation in this
industry.  They OEM for lots of car mfgr's.

But you have to do what you feel comfortable doing.  I bought my belts from
AA because they're very close to me and I don't have to drive all the way
across town to the Porsche dealer.  

Good luck
