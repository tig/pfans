Two questions: What should I expect for normal vacuum reading with my
'77 924 (stock) engine out of gear (Park) at idle? I'll take datum points in
any reasonable units, the conversion's on the face of my gauge. I've got
a reading of 10 inches of Hg at idle, which currently happens to be
2000 rpm (automatic, not running properly). I know the idle speed and
vacuum are inter-related, I'm just having problems getting rid of the
problem. I know the spray technique for finding leaks, just have to use it
yet... The problem has started within the past 3-4 weeks, and it's only
affected at idle.

Second question, a poll actually:

How many people are there out there with early 924's? I'd like to compile
a list of what our distribution is: year, model (924 or 931),
possible unique factors about your car, especially Martini editions and
automatics, since I keep getting asked by newer people just how many
of us are out there, and I'd really like to know now. I won't be keeping a
list, just numbers (don't want that responsibility), and I'll repost the results
to the list at large (send your replies directly to me).

TIA...
