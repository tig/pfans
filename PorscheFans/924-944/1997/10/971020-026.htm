Wes,

I was talking about replacing all the bulbs in the
instrument cluster not just the 3, 2W bulbs, which
BTW, looked pretty good which makes me believe
that the lack of  brightness is just something we're
going to have to live with.

It is just another example of where Porsche didn't
spend a whole lot of effort designing.   You've got to
admit that the interior design, albeit on the surface
looks good, but when you dig into it (e.g., the plastic
cassette hinge, the thin plastic which covers the
climate controls, the infamous dash), realize how
cheap and overpriced they made it!  Don't get me
wrong, I enjoy the car very much.....
Sorry, got side tracked!

Bottom line, I believe we're screwed when it come to
night time driving!  If you're in the dark for awhile, the
dash does seem to be brighter -- only because you're
eyes have adjusted.  3, 5W bulbs would've been nice
which would have made the dimmer switch useable!

Happy Motoring
