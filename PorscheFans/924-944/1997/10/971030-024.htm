On the other hand, I've heard those curves referred to as aggressive and
muscular.  The 944 precusor, the 924 GT with the wide, tacked-on fenders,
has been termed the meanest looking of the evolutionary line -- not sure if
the owners would like their cars called feminine.  Like you said,
interesting psychological stuff here.

Did the book sat WHY women give their cars female names? Maybe some kind of
a same-sex partnership? Get me thru this traffic w/out overheating and I
promise to change your coolant and oil?
