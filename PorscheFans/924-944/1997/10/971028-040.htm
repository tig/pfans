Most likely the relay.  Be brave and remove the cover.. clean up the
contacts with a file or fine emery paper if they are not completely burned
away.  Replace with identical part only.  Unlike 924's, fewer 944 relays
interchange with a like VW part.  A clue is to look for the VW logo or a
VW style part number on the relay.

You will want to disassemble the rear wiper motor assembly and find out
why the cam-operated park switch is not not contacting properly.  I took
mine apart last year.. when I did so I was greeted with a splash of water
(!) and dry, horrible looking grease.  I cleaned up the whole lot, 
regreased and reassembled..  just like new.

No relation whatsoever.. just coincidence.
