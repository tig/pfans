Uh oh.

I recently mentioned that I had felt a "slight" vibration in the gearshift 
lever in the 3000-3200rpm range after having new belts, rollers, 
tensioners installed.  I received a couple of notes indicating that this may 
well be a balance shaft timing/belt problem.

I hadn't paid much attention to it as I only accelerate or decelerate through 
that range, don't seem to cruise there in any gears.  But, between the 
FAQ and the Pfans list info, I've become extremely anal any time I hear 
the words belt and problem together in a sentence.

So, my ?? is how much of a chance would I be taking to wait until at least 
1k miles and then having this checked out when the belts are 
retensioned?  On the other hand, if I get it checked soon (300 miles on 
belts) what tension should the belts be set to?  The new or broken in belt 
spec?  And, would the belts still need to be retensioned in the 1000-1500 
mile interval?
