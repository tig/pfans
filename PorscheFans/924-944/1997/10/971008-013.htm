Howdy,

Well, it looks like Mark (Paul's younger brother) will once again be driving
around in a 944T, this time a 1989 944 Turbo in the same beautiful charcoal
grey (Anthracite Grey I think it's called), only this time no sport seats,
but he does get the bigger turbo etc with the "S" models.

The price agreed upon was quite reasonable.  For data's sake, the car has
120,000km on it, quite clean, needs a few things detailed like the turbo
symbol on the back is broken, and little things like that, full documented
history, local B.C. Canadian car, it was Weltmeister chipped at 100,000km,
belts and all that were done before the chip was installed at 100,000km.
Body is straight, no major accidents (bumped a curb and needed to replace
a lower plastic panel).  He's agreed (subject to inspection) on a price
of C$19,000+7% tax = $20,330 or US$14,839.  This is significantly less than
what Paul and I paid for our cars a year go US$22,000, but it seems
that low mileage 944T's around here command a real premium.  Recent trends
out here are showing that low mileage 944T's are going for around C$31,000
(US$22677+7%tax!) for 89+ models!

I guess I will be able to dyno a Weltmeister car afterall!

Farzaan.
