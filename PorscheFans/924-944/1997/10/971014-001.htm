Hi Gang,

Hope someone can help.  My 90 S2 (58k mi) is still starting
hard (requires two tries after sitting overnight or longer).
New battery, replaced worn brushes and lubed the starter -- spins
real quick now!!  Thought the problem was gone, but it's not ...
Also been through 2 tankfulls of Chevron, one with additional Techron
(got to lay off the bottle for awhile ...)

Dave Cooley (and someone else, whose mail I lost -- sorry not to give
a proper citation here ...) kindly suggested checking the
temperature sensor -- OK so which is the temperature sensor?  Looking
under the intake manifold I see several items bolted to the block

a) frontmost, just below the coolant hose attachment from the radiator,
blue plastic plug body, which when removed reveals 2 wires.  Whatzit?

b) look back a bit, between the 1st and 2nd intake port, another 2 wire
gizmo with a metal hex body in the block.  Whatzit?

c) back another 2 inches, still between the 1st and 2nd intake port,
another device, rather flat black plastic with a bolt through its body
into the block.  Whatzit?  (This one must be the temperature sensor, 'cause
it's the least accesible.)

d) between the 1st and 2nd intake port, there's another electrical
gizmo - a 2 inch diameter aluminum cased cylinder bolted to the intake
manifold.  Whatzit?

Would love to know what these guys are.

Thanks in advance
