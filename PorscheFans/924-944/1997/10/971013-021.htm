Kevin B.,

I'm going to addres both the question referenced below and your other E-mail 
which essentially asked why I am switching from the Weltmeister to the 
Brey-Krause Strut Bar.

Good question. I wasn't sure so I called KMR and learned that the change in 
toe is negligable -- about .75 mm (notice this is LESS than ONE millimeter). 
There were factory adjusters for the 968 Cup Car and the 911 RSR which had a 
more significant effect on toe because the slots were curved. Because KMR's 
unit has straight slots, the effect is typically immeasureable on most 
alignment equipment. This assumes you stay within the normal -1 degree street 
camber and -2 to -3 degrees track camber. If you went to -4 or more track 
camber you might want to adjust toe as well, but -4+ probably means you are 
running racetires. For R1's, the recommended camber is -2.25 degrees and for 
Hoosiers about -3 degrees.

As to the Weltmeister bar, it does the job but blocks my access to the four 
allen bolts for adjusting camber. It seems quite strong and the "hat" which 
circles the strut would do a good job of distributing the loads more evenly. I 
also prefer the "slicker" look of the Brey-Krause bar. It is really a 
beautiful piece that is very well made. By the way, the new carbon fiber 
Brey-Krause camber bar looks like a steel bar painted flat black... just in 
case anyone was wondering about it. And it costs $525.

One other correction:  I mentioned earlier the KMR Strut Mounts were $650, but 
the correct price is $625. Sorry for the misinformation.

<< However, one other advantage to the KMR pieces is they provide a much 
larger range of camber adjustment, and it is easy to switch between street and 
track settings.  Just jack up the wheel, loosen four allen screws, slide the 
strut to the appropriate marked location in the slot, and clamp the allen 
screws back  down. Takes about 3 minutes a side while changing tires or just 
jack it up and  slide it over.  >>

Denny,
Good info -- thanks.   Regarding the front camber "quick-change,"  don't you
need to readjust toe after changing the camber?
