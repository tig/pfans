Alyn,
     I didn't have the tool when I re-assembled mine (yes I was care-full to 
align it by hand, and used the relief valve as the guide), no problems yet, 
~10kmiles. If you have the time to obtain the tool, I would certainly suggest 
using it. If you are going to turn one on a lath, you could easily take the 
measurements from your oil pressure relief valve, all you are trying to do is 
align the oil/coolant heat exchanger housing to the block, so it could be as 
simple as a metal rod with two diameters (one dia. for the hole in the 
housing, the other dia. for the hole in the block.)
Good Luck,
  Ezra
