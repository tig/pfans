Thought I would throw in my .02 on parts vendors.  I have recently ordere=
d
parts from Zims in Texas and have had good luck with them.  Kirk is the
order desk, he has a computer but has most of the part #s and inventory i=
n
his head.  He has shipped the orders complete and they have arrived just
when he said they would.  I told him about Porschefans and we talked abou=
t
Vertex and PAR.  He indicated the other two were advertising some parts a=
t
cost.  Like everyone, I want a good deal but being screwed once by Vertex=

was enough for me.  If you sell items at cost either service or quality h=
as
to suffer.  So if you give Kirk a call, tell him you are with Porschefans=
=2E =

The group should use its purchasing power to support the people that give=

good service.

Last January I purchased a set of Nology sparkplug wires from Automotion.=
 =

The wires did not fit correctly and I called Automotion who said no probl=
em
send them back.  Fool that I am, I decided to contact the Nology factory
here in San Diego.  After a minor nightmare with this bozo at Nology, the=

wires still were not satisfactory.  When I finally got around to calling
Automotion again, it was September. They apologized for the problem and
authorized a return with absolutely no argument.  =


Both Jason at Paragon Products and George B. at 944 Ecology are
contributing list members.  I have done business with both of them and wi=
ll
continue to do so. They are both very knowledgable, helpful and provide
good service.

I haven't had the opportunity to deal with Kevin Gross, Don Istook or Dav=
e
Cooly but certainly would.  I wonder if they make house calls?

The old saying, "The cheapest price isn't always the best deal" rings tru=
er
all the time.
