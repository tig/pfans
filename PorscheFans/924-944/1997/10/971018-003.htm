Once again I must ask for your help.  It seemed so simple.  My 1983 944 has
had the clock light bulb out for 3 months now.  I decided it was time, and
for the first time, visited the local dealer's parts dept. and left with a
bill under $20.  But for the life of me I can not figure out how to access
the back of the clock.  I have taken out the 4 screws that affix the aux.
instrument cluster (housing for clock and oil pressure guages) but it still
won't come out.  You can't access the clock from the side without dismanlting
the entire console.  Is there a way to remove just the aux. ibnstr. cluster?
 If so how?

I've tried praying, chanting and mild prying.  I give up.  Any help to get
thos 93 cents bulb in would be greatly appreciated.
