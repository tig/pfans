Please, God, tell me someone knows the answer...

I have an 82 931 with a bad fuel pump relay problem.  The system is 
the same as all 924's with the inclusion of a frequency valve for 
lambda sensor system and an extra fuel pump in the circuit, so any 
ideas are appreciated...

The power side wiring on my fuel pump relay heats very badly.  
Everything works fine at start up, but once the relay heats, the fuel 
pumps become intermittent (seems to be from relay turning on and off 
from heat).  Here's what I've eliminated:

fuel pumps- 7.5 amps current draw (should be ok)

rewired fuel pumps with chassis ground to rear of car

rewired relay ground, bypassing overboost cutoff switch for time being

rewired relay to ignition coil line

rewired battery power line

checked resistance of control pressure regulator and auxiliary air 
valve  (both OK)

No apparent short in engine harness part of wiring

Also, the fuse for the stuff on the auxiliary board gets really hot, 
too.  Note that I just rebuilt the engine and reinstalled it.  The car 
worked before I took it out (well, with lots of smoke, but everything 
worked...)

Sorry for bandwidth.  Thanks for any help.

Dave
