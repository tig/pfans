The 944 had as a standard size the 215/60/15 tires, ahem I mean tyres :-)
(like my old 944S) which required 29/36.  The T and the S2 were heavier
cars than yours and though you probably need to increase pressure due to
the lower profiles, 37 is probably on the high side for your car.  36/36
was applicable for the 87 T, compare weights (I would list them but my
technical specs book is at home) and go from there.

I will go out on a limb here, but are your accesory belts tight?  I
would guess that when the car is warm the belts might be somewhat
looser than when cold and given you said it happens at low rpm the
steering pump may simply be turning too slowly.

Also, check the fluid level on your power steering reservoir. If it is low
add some fluid and see if your car is leaking around the top of where the
power steering hoses meet the reservoir.  You may need to replace the hose
clamps w/ the updated zebra-style clamps.  If you want the Porsche P/Ns,
they are 999.512.346.02 and 999.512.450.02.  BTW, the fluid loves to eat
the rubber on the ball joints, so if there are leaks, fix them.  The ball
joints are not individually replacable, they are part of the control
arms.
