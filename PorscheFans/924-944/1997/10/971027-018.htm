Every year, we go through this feeling of terror :)  My first year of ownership,
I even left the car parked for one day because I thought I had blown something.
By asking this list, I was able to find out that it is likely condensation build-
up from the cold weather and short driving distances.  Check your dipstick, if
it is all "poo brown", then you have a serious problem.  If it's just the cap,
take the car out for a boot through the mountains and enjoy yourself, get the
car nice and hot and then check the cap, if it's gone, you aren't driving far
enough to burn the condensation out of the oil.
