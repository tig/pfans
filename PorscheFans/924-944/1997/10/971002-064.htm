Up here in the frozen north (Edmonton Alberta) the road crews use sand and
gravel because the temps are below minus 16C almost all winter and salt is
only good above this temp. I have used in order of preference. 
1) Blizzaks (very good for ice and snow but terrible for handling) 
2) Pirelli 210s (good for snow,- So, so, on ice. good handling and comes in
Pcar sizes- 205-55-and 225-50-16s)
4) Toyo Studded (cannot remember the series - would not recommend them)
I have also used Dunlops and Yokohamas previous generation and therefore
old technology - I was not impressed with either.  Perhaps their new
iterations are better. 
I have been told that the new Michelin Alpins are pretty good and so are
the Toyo Observes - similar compound to the Blizzaks, I believe. 

Since the 944 has a close to 50/50 weight balance, does it handles fairly

Yes. It handles well - with the following caveat - You can lose it very
easily if you approach the traction limits of your tires.  The back will
come to visit very quickly. A four wheel drive like a quattro (Audi) or
even a front wheel drive is superior.

I read your shimmy problems/woes with interest.  I had similar problems
with Goodyear NCTs on my Audi Quattro. The dealer replaced wheel bearings,
control arm bushings and even repacked the front CVs.  A smart independent
mechanic swapped all four wheels and tires from another customer's car and
solved the problem.  You did get advice along these lines from another
listmember but as was the case with me, this kind of problem is solved with
anecdotal, rather than empirical information. BTW the NCTs exhibited shimmy
only when hot - slow speeds did not elicit the problem making it that much
more difficult to solve.
