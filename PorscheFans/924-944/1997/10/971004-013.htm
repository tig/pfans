Well, it looks like my sister's 87 924s is mine for free plus the cost of
getting it running again. Too good to pass up. It well require the
replacement of the flex coupling in the drive train, which I'm told is where
the clutch would be in a manual. I've called a few places and it seems this
rather overpriced piece is in the $750. to $850. price range. I gather that
is because it is a unique to porsche part and they figure they can get away
with it. If, however there is an oem source I would love to know about it.
Also, any wisdom on the replacement which might not be obvious from manuals
etc. is greatly appreciated.  Furthermore, this a truly great group. -thanks
