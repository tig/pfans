Does anybody had problems with 944S and S2 camshafts. Two friends of
mine are experiencing very costly repairs because, I think, the design
is not very good. 

The first has an 88 944S and he changed the two cams (with oem parts)
and the tensionner one year ago. He drove less than 10k miles since and
when we lifted the cam cover last week we found that the intake cam is
about to let go. The sprocket teeth show about 50% wear. 

The other one bought his 89 S2 less than a month ago and the two cams
are gone (no more teeth), the chain broke and was trapped between the
exhaust cam and the tensionner and broke one of the ears that support it
to the head, of course he bent a couple of valves. VERY EXPENSIVE
proposition.;-( 

If I had one of those cars I would do a routine (yearly) check of the
condition of those parts. 

Questions, 

are all the 16 valves engines so prone to wear the cams that fast?      

Is there a cure or a preventive maintenance to prevent this to
happen(Besides changing the cams every other year)?
