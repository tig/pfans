I have no qualms with most of your statement.  However, I would suggest
using a large "breaker bar" for <underline>removal</underline> of the
wheel lug nuts instead of using the torque wrench.  Once the nuts have
been "cracked", use either a speed wrench or "X"-type lug wrench (I
have both types, and have put colored tape around the proper end of the
"X" type for easier identification) for quick removal - and also use
the same tools in reverse order to re-install, with the torque wrench
being the last to be used once the lug nuts are snug and the tire is
back to partial contact with the ground.  I always make two complete
circuits around the car with the torque wrench.  Also, if you get one
of the "click" type torque wrenches, be sure to reset it to "zero" for
storage.  And, you might want to keep a couple of extra lug nuts on
hand for peace of mind.  And, also, I keep some brush-on high temp
anti-sieze compound in my toolbox for the studs - I've never had one
freeze up on me yet.
