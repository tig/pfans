|I'm posting this for a friend with an '86 951.  Here's his description =
of
|what's happening with the car:
|
|     I had trouble starting it the first=20
|     time. The first time I tried to crank it, the starter did not =
engage=20
|     (I think), because there was no sound from the starter ??!! The =
next=20
|     time I tried it, the starter engaged, but the electrical current =
was=20
|     too low to get it started. Instead of messing with it right then, =
I=20
|     just charged it for 4 hours, after which it started OK. When I =
drove=20
|     it this time, I watched VERY CAREFULLY what was reading on the =
ampere=20
|     gauge. Usually, the engine alternator charge to the battery is=20
|     "higher" (I might expect to see 14 volts ++) than normal right =
after=20
|     the battery has run down, because the charger rarely fully =
restores=20
|     the battery charge as well as the car. I did not see this in the =
car=20
|     even though I drove for over 30 minutes.
|    =20
|     This is what I noticed: the ampere gauge has a line at 12 volts, =
14=20
|     volts, and 16 volts. The spacing between the 12-to-14, and the=20
|     14-to-16 is approximately 1/4 inch for each section of the gauge; =
the=20
|     needle rose to 12.2 volts and never fluctuated off that the whole =
time=20
|     I drove the car. To me, this is wrong. Usually, the ampere gauge
|follows        the RPMs to a limited extent; idle might be 10-to-12 =
volts,
|2000 RPM might      be 13 volts, and 4000 RPM and above might be 14 =
volts +;
|even when I revved      the engine at rest, or in gear, the ampere =
gauge
|needle never budged.
|    =20
|     I really wonder if the engine alternator is functioning correctly.
|
|So, anyone have any ideas or experienced similar problems?  Feel free =
to
|reply privately or to the list.  Thanks!
