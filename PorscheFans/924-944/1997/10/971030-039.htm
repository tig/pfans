I just went through a similar episode and although I thought my TPS and air
sensor connections were clean - they were not. (Thanks Farzaan) Boost would
hang up at 1.2 with  consequent loss of performance.  The best way to clean
the connections is to use a Dremel at low, low rpms with a straight narrow
carbon steel brush and gently clean all of the flat spades in the
connector/s until they are shiny new. I used dielectric grease to prevent a
repeat episode.  Do one connector at a time and go for a drive - this way
you can be sure which one caused the problem. In my case it was the airflow
sensor.

The tricky vacuum line is the one under the intake manifold at the firewall
- the cycling valve I believe - two lines going into a small plastic gizmo
- well enough hidden to be overlooked.  Mine was loose and just sitting
there, pretending to be connected. I probably pulled it loose when I was
fiddling with the 02 connector which is nearby.  
The other one is the rubber connector under the throttle - again very hard
to see because its well covered by the intake boot.

When it runs properly there should be NO performance degradation - it
should have good response to pedal input and should rocket after boost
builds up beyond 1.2.
