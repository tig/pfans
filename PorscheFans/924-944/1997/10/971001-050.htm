When my boyfriend got his 944, we had to drive it "everywhere".  Never mind
that his AC wasn't working at the time and it was 90 degrees out.  Not only
that, he never let me drive it.  So what did I do?  I went and bought my own
944 and now I understand what his fascination is.

Let your wife drive it some and she'll understand.  Of course, you might not
get to drive it too much after her first time!!!
