Hi,

I just recently purchased a 92 Porsche 968 coupe.  This is my first Porsche, so 
I have a few ignorant questions.  I was wondering if anyone could give me some 
suggestions regarding the following:

1.  Is it possible to make a copy of the wheel-lock keys?  I received two with 
the car, but considering how it's a big pain in the butt if you lose them, I 
wouldn't mind storing away a third just in case.

2.  I plan on driving the car during the winter.  Any suggestions regarding 
"Winterization" aside from snow tires and rust treatment?  I was only going to 
put snows on the rear wheels.  Is this OK?

3.  With regards to snow tires, I was planning on picking up a spare set of 
rims and just using those during the winter.  Are the wheels unique for the 968 
or can I use any 924/944 rims?

4.  Should I go to Porsche for all my maintenance?  Obviously for stuff like an 
oil change, tune up or major repair, its probably my safest course of action.  
However, what about for straight forward stuff like fixing a tire, changing a 
light bulb, new battery, change of fluids, etc...  Its seems to me that anybody 
could do this as well as Porsche????  I have a mechanic whom I've used for many 
years and trust.  He says he can do the work, but doesn't see too many Porsches 
(especially 968s).  But from what I've read, there's a lot of potential 
pitfalls in working on these cars.  Any suggestions here??

5.  One time, I came back to the car and the alarm was going off.  I didn't see 
any signs of forcible entry or anyone around the car.  Will the alarm go off by 
itself or are there thing that can happen which will trigger the alarm even 
though its not being broken into.

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I'd also luv to hear from anyone else who has 
a 968 to hear about his/her experiences.  Thanks,

Alex Lee
