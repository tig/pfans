I am gathering opinions on what to look for with my car.

Symptoms:

Boost intermittent.  Some times I get 1.6 bar, sometimes 1.2 maximum.  It 
seems to be one or the other no middle ground.

If I stop for a few minutes with the engine off, it may return to 1.6.

What things should I check for?

Recently I had the intake manifold off to service the oil pan gasket.  A 
cursory look at the vacuum lines and wires seems all right, but a 
detailed review is in order.

I understand that the boost gauge is not absolute in accuracy, but it 
seems to me that I should get 1.7 bar from my 89 Turbo.  Am I right?  I 
thought that is what I used to get.

Also, either I am just getting used to this car, or there is a 
performance degradation from what I remember.  It just seems ho-hum any 
more.  Again, when I first got it last February, it seemed to be 
"quicker".  Today I did a short run while I had 1.6 bar.  It pulled 140 
mph without much of a fuss, but that isn't very scientific and I was 
running out of road.   Good thing, too, a State Trooper was perched at 
the end of the road where this section of road mates with the main 
highway.

Thanks in advance,

There is a significant performance difference to be felt between 1.2 and 
1.6.
