I replaced the factory speakers with some MB Quarts that I'm quite happy
with.  I think they're 100.8s in the rear, and 100.3s in front.  I had to
fabricate a plate for the front speakers, though, since they're 5.25"
2-ways.  At first I installed some 4" Alpine 2-ways, but they just sounded
too "tinny", so I swapped them out for the MBs.  I've also heard nice
things about the a/d/s speakers, but at the sizes I was looking at, I liked
the MBs better.  I'd strongly urge you to shop around and listen to as many
different speakers as you can, and try to find a dealer who's open to
letting you trade speakers a couple of times until you find the ones that
are right.

Speakers I'd recommend listening to would be: a/d/s, MB Quart, Alpine, Polk
Audio, and Altec Lansing.  I'd also recommend getting a copy of Telarc's
_Spies_ CD -- it's a good "test" disc to take along.  Listen to it at home
a few times first, then hit the dealers!

Cheers!
