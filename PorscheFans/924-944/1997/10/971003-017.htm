P-fans:

Seeing as people are sharing their parts suppliers experiences, I thought
that I'd share a couple of mine:

1)  Automotion - A little pricey, but the order arrived on time and
correctly.  No complaints from me - customer service seemed to be 
competent and knowledgeable.

2)  Automobile Atlanta - Excellent catalogue.  Unfortunately, the ordering
fell a little short, as I ordered a set of factory service manuals for my
924 and was charged a higher price than that in the catalog.  When I asked
about it, I was told that I'd be given a credit for the difference.  When
I ordered parts the next time, they forgot to send one part (wasn't
charged for it, though) and my credit seemed to be disregarded.  I came
away unimpressed.

3)  Clair Parts International - Excellent bunch to deal with.  Service
people seem to know what they're talking about, and when a part arrived
that I thought was incorrect, they called Porsche AG and found out that
the part I wanted was no longer available, which I found odd.  However,
they were helpful.

For reference, I'm (slowly) rebuilding a 1978 924 that I probably
shouldn't have bought.  I've always wanted to rebuild a car and own a
Porsche, so I thought I'd combine the 2.

Oops.  ;)
