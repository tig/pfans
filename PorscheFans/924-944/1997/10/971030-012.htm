OK, this is very superficial response and no help to Isaac, but I think
this is the first time I've noted a gender applied to a 944.  I never
thought of a 944 as a "she", but I've also never applied the masculine
pronoun to any of my 944s.  Is this indicative of a emotional detachment
from life in general and should I be worried about it? Even in my tenderest
moments, I've only referred to 944s as "the fun car" or "road buddy".  In
less tender moments, I've applied "slow" or "fat understeering cow".  Guess
"cow" implies gender.  Not sure where this is leading -- does anyone
reflexively assign a gender to their 944? Had an Alfa Guilietta Spyder once
that was a "she", and a Chevy van that definitely wasn't a "she"....

Regarding the stalling/no start problem, I won't go there, except to ask if
the pre-85s have the solenoid-activated intake bypass used to control
air/fuel mixture during cold startup. 

Sorry about the digression, Isaac.
