The PO installed these cupholders (Automotion) on my car, and I hate them.
Personally I think they look like warts on the door panel, but objectively
speaking, they don't look too bad--quality appearance, etc. However, the
internal plastic pieces squeak and rattle when closed. I took the driver's
side off--haven't yet had the holes repaired--but will probably leave the
passenger side on because damage is already done to the door panel.

My SO likes to use cupholder when she's in the car, but anything taller
than a 12oz aluminum can partially blocks my view of the mirror. And
besides, my car rides so rough that if a cup of coffee is more than 3/4
full then it splashes out of the small hole in the lid anyway.
