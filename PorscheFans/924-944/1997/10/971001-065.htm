I hate to rake a business over the coals, but here is my experience with 
Tweeks, to protect the folks here on the list:

I purchased a rebuilt water pump from them which lasted one year (15,000
miles).  It had a two year guarantee, but that is only good for a
replacement pump from them, and _I_ had to pay shipping and handling to
send the old pump back and for the replacement rebuild to be returned. 
They refused to refund my money (I wanted to get a factory pump), and
refused to re-imburse me for the labor I was required to pay to replace
the defective pump. 

I sent a letter to customer service (along with photocopies of several
repair orders) politely outlining the situation, and a request to be
re-imbursed for 60% of the labor charge (to compensate for time on the
pump, and I had some rollers and the belts replaced since the car was
already apart).  I reminded them that I would expect the pump to have a
serviceable life of at least 40 - 60,000 miles, not 15,000 and yearly
replacement. 

I noted at the bottom of my letter about the Porschefiles list, and that I
anticipated giving a favorable report re: Tweeks to over 1100 944 owners. 
If I do not get a favorable response from them I will consider further
action.  Not only to recover money, but to prod Tweeks in the future to
buy rebuilt water pumps from a rebuilder that will use a quality $10.00
bearing instead of a cheesy $6.00 one. 

The people I spoke to at Tweeks were reasonably polite, I just couldn't 
get any satisfaction.

The ultimate lesson: Never, ever, EVER! use a rebuilt pump, unless you
have money and time to burn.  I saved $300 initially, over buying a
factory pump and just paid out $600 in labor last month to replace the 
rebuild. Great economy.  :-(
