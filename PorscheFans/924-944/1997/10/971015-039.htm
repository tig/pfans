150 milliamps is rather on the high side.  I think that 20 to 50 
milliamps is a more normal engine-off draw.  However, this may or may 
not be your problem.

What to do?  First check the battery.  Make sure the cells are topped 
off, adding distilled water as needed.  Make sure each cell has decent 
specific gravity by using a hygrometer (hope I spelled that right!).

Next, try to locate the source of the higher draw.  The easiest way to 
do this is to remove one fuse after another from the fusebox, while you 
have an ammeter in-line with the battery.  If someone has hacked an 
aftermarket piece of equipment into the harness, it may be drawing 
straight from the battery, and this test won't bring the draw down.

Happy hunting,

Kevin
