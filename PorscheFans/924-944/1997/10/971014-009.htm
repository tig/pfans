Howdy,

In the first session, Paul, myself and Wes were put into the advanced group
or fast group as some call it.  Our group consisted of a few race 510's,
three 944TS's, Wes's 944S2, two Player's Ltd. Camaros, and a few other
slow 510's driven by fast drivers, and a 1993 Tri-rotor RX-7 race car.

In our first run group, the track was damp from morning rain.  I had my
S-02's on, Paul had the Kuhmos, Wes had his R1's and Patrick (89 944T)
had Yoko RSII's on.  Pretty much every car in that run group had race tires
except for me.  I completely dominated this sessions.  I started second car
from the back and passed each and every car in that run group and ended up
about 1/2 lap ahead by the end to the 2nd place guy.  It was fun picking
people off one by one.

In our second session, the track had dry patches forming.  I was able to
stay with the race tires guys, matching their laps.  I ended that session
about three cars ahead from where I started (mainly passing the slower 510s).

In my third and last session, it was completely dry and it was "R" tire time.
I just could not hang with Paul.  I tried and tried and tried, but I just
couldn't hang on.  He'd slowly, but surely put a few tenths on me in every
corner and I just couldn't stay.  Then one of the PLayer's Camaros came up
behind me and I had to let him by because I was holding him up through the
corners.  Paul managed to put a 1/2 straight lead on me by about 8-10 laps
and Wes had moved to the medium group so that he could pass a few cars too.
The only cars I could keep behind me in the dry were Patrick's 944T (I was
putting about 3/10ths a lap on him) and a few 510's.

In this session, I really wanted to catch Paul since I could still see him
down the straight.  I went for an all-or-nothing lap.  I came into turn 1
at 210km/h,  braked at the 3 marker, barely made the turn-in point.  Drifted
to the wall, full throttle, shift to third, tap the brakes, start to drift
into 2B, whooah, oversteer!  Get the car settled, brake, downshift to 2nd,
turn into 3, ack, a little late, but ok, I can still get it through 4 without too much lost if I use up all the track.  I pointed my nose at the wall and
went WIDE OPEN.  Unfortunately, the back end started to come out and here I
am with my passenger window almost pressed against the wall and the back end
decides to come around!  I managed to ride out the slide and kept going
without much lost in time.  Brake like hell at the 3 marker and downshift
to 2nd to turn into 5, a little bit of a rear end wobble as I brake and
turn-in.  Then, floor it into the Carousel, tap the brakes to turn it in
and go for a shot across the straight and use it all up.  When I hit the 
bump I started a BIG slide onto the straight and almost tapped a tire wall.
Where was Paul???  Had I overdriven?  I couldn't see him anymore, oh no!
I felt so discouraged, after all that work, and he had just pulled away.
My next lap, each and every turn worker was giving me the naughty boy finger,
so I calmed down.  The 3 cars behind me and the two in front had pulled into
the pits, so I spent the next 5-7 laps all by myself, bored.  When Paul had
disapeared ahead of me, he had actually pulled off the lap before because of
boiled brake fluid, so I was doing all that crazy driving for nothing!

When I pulled in, a corner worker said they were expecting to see some sparks
from my sideview mirror down the backstraight!  

Paul went out for his last session (I was bleeding my brakes and didn't
make the roll call) and had an awesome dice with one of the Player's Camaros.
They were circling the track at very good laps times (59's).  Paul
was eventually catching this Camaro, but I don't believe he was able to
make the pass, but it was intense none-the-less, and they had a great battle.

The 944T is an awsesome track car, it doesn't heat up at all, it's just
happy, happy, happy out there.  I was shifting smoothly and calmly, no
hard shifts.  My car drifts all four wheels perfectly with a hint of
oversteer, which is just how I like it, the power is very good.  Another
30hp and 30ft-lbs of torque and a reduction of weight by 200lbs would make
this a very hard combination to beat.

Paul and I were both very happy with the Porterfield pads, but we weren't
happy with our fluid.  We were always boiling our fluid.  Next time,
I will try some of the fluids Barry recommended.

Anyhow, it was a fun event.  Darren and Wes did very well in the medium
group and as funny as it sounds, by the end of most sessions, the only
cars still running were usually the 944T's.  All the others had brake
problems, or overheating, or various other problems.

The course workers said that when Paul was battling with the Camaro,
his front rotors were glowing (he has black wheels so it's easier to see
the glowing).

I love this car! I love this car! I love this car! I love this car!
