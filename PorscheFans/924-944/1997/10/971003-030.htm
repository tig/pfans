Hello, and I promise this will be the last time I ask any questions until I
can answer one!!!  Thank you everyone for the suggestions concerning my shift
lever problems!
I agree with the reply's, I do not think it is the transmission, I could be
wrong, but it seems to me that I have heard that they are pretty bulletproof.
It seems that all the problems are with the shift lever itself. I listened to
the advise and attempted to check the shift lever adjustment point. BUT, I
cannot find it!!! On an 87 944s, where is the adjustment bolt located? I
checked the retaining clip under the shift boot, it is in place. So where do
I go from here? I drove the car a few miles today, and it really doesnt seem
to be the transmission, so if anyone has anymore suggestions I would forever
be endebted to you all !!! And please if anyone knows where the adjustment
bolt is, please let me know!!

Thanks in advance,

Terry
