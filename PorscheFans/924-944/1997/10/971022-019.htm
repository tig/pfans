<<Several 944 people that
I have talked with insisted that the chain tensioner had problems only when
belts were not service and replaced properly. Who to believe?

        On the subject of chipping, what do you recommend for an S2. What
will it do and how much does it cost? Thanks for your advice.

Hello David
	I'm not a mechanic - just mechanically inclined. I am a service advisor for
a Bosh independent repair shop. But I do most of the work ( including the
last clutch job!) on my 1986 951! I also have a few friends that who work in
a Porsche dealer. I have seen a few failures of the chain tensioner (about
four in the last year!), repairs range from $1000- $4000. Some of the techs
believe that because of infrequent oil changes, the tensioner gets gummed up
and fails. I'm not sure on the why - but If it was my car I know I would
replace the tensioner - esp if it has never been replaced! The tensioner is
located under the valve cover, there is a chain the connects the two
camshafts together. The chain is in the center of the cylinder head, and the
tensioner keeps that chain slacked tight and tensioned! 
	As for recommended chips, I have AutoThority chips in my car. AutoThority
has a 30 day money back garrantee, and they are a honest bunch of guys to
deal with. They tune their chips for the best power on the dyno and for the
smoothest feel in your seat of the pants while driving!  You can Talk to
"Chris" @AutoThority 703-323-0707.
