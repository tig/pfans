Todd,

Every time I see aposting like this (i.e. take the car to a mechanic
for a service and afterwards a couple of things are wrong) I do not
know if I should laugh or cry. 

>Need some diagnostic help.  Car is 90 944 S2 with 58k mi.
>Recently had 60k service - at which time the mechanic also
>"adjusted the mixture".  The next day the car took two tries
>to start.  Starting problem exists only after car sits overnight -
>i.e. DEAD COLD.

ADJUSTED THE MIXTURE, this is BS. A 944 never needs 
adjusting the mixture, the DME controls everything (and much
better than a mechanic).

>Took it back to the shop, and the mechanic said the starter
>was drawing excessive current.  I pulled the starter, took

>replaced brushes and relubed for me.  Re-mounted the starter

Wait a minute, he adjusted the mixture, then the car was hard 
to start and then he had you take the starter apart. If he adjusted
something I would bet that there is a 99.999999% chance that
whatever your mechanic did caused the hard starting.

>Electrical:  I'd like to check the ground straps.  Where are they?

Highly unlikely that they have something to do with this. If you
can do things like pull the starter why don't you do the service 
yourself.

>Fuel system:  I'm suspicious since the problem first appeared after
>the mechanic reset the fuel mixture.  Where is the adjustment -- I'd
>like to return it to stock setting.  Also, since the 60k mi service

This is probably what you should have done in the first place.

Good luck.

Paul
