What year Rabbit ball joint are you referring to, what brand.
I tried the joint for the '85 and earlier on my '86 944 but had to machine
a sleeve since the Rabbit ball was approx' 1/8 inch smaller in diameter.
You mention the advantage of relocating the A-arm to it's original spot
but I think if you could get the right ball and socket you could do it
without removing the arm at all.

Yours in motorsport,
Kory Krofft
'86 944

>The fact of the matter is that the ball joint parts look identical to
