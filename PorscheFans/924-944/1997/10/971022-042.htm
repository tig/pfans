Dear P-fans,

I'm sure you've all heard it before, but please try to limit copying text
when replying to a message to only the relevant information. It is usually
not necessary to copy the whole darn thing. This is especially true when
you receive the list in digest form.

Just a friendly reminder,

Thanks,

GR

Just another solution that works for me. 

I bought one of those cheap cupholders that you've seen around for years. I
think they are designed to hook over the top of door panel with a little piece
that fits where the glass is. They kind of look like an upside down "L" with a
basket that can hold sodas at what would normally be the top of the "L." 

Anyway, what I did was cut off the flat part of the "L" and make a shorter
version of it that fits over the lip that seperates the gear shift area from
the passenger compartment (this was done by cutting the plastic and then
boiling it so that it got soft and could be remolded.) I also use a large lag
bolt to hold the cage out so that the new "L" area would remain vertical. The
cup holder is immediately to the right of the gear shift (but where the
passenger might put his/her knees)

This type of hold holds every type of drink from big gulps to 12 oz cans and
can be removed in an instant.

BTW, has anyone else notice that the ashtray area (when the ashtray is
removed) is the perfect size for 12 oz cans?
