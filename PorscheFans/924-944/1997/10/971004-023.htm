Look for a balance shaft that is out of time... If you have had the water
pump replaced recently,
there is a high likelihood that the mechanic did not time the balance shaft
sprockets on the
balance shafts properly.

As far as the door locks go, check that the driver side door is latched
properly before trying
to lock the system. There is a check mechanism which is designed to keep you
from locking
yourself out (without the key)...

Good Luck!

    Subject: Door Locks & Shifter Shake


        I have a 90 S2 Cab that I absolutely love.  I've had the car about a
year now, and have found this list to be a great source of information and
entertainment.  I drive the car daily, except for winter, and have
experienced only two minor problems.  There is a significant vibration
through the shifter at about 3200 rpm.  But it only seems to occur for maybe
100 rpm, then goes away.  Any ideas?  The other problem is in the door
locks.  Occasionally, the car refuses to be locked.  Whether I use the key
outside the car, or the button on the console, the locks engage, then
immediately disengage.  I've found that I can force the lock to stay engaged
by holding the key in the lock position a few extra seconds.  The locks
attempt to unlock, but holding the key down seems to overpower them.  By the
way, my brother is a priest if an exorcism is the recommended cure.

    Thanks,
    Steve Stroupe
