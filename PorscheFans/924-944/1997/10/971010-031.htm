Michael I have to agree with you. As an engineer and a marketing
consultant my job is determine how to convince/educate  people on the
merits of a particular product or service. Building a brand or image
arond a product makes it easier to convince people to buy your product
because of what it represents. As a marketer I give Porsche full credit
for building a brand image around the 911. As an engineer I am amazed
that they have been able to sell an essentially inferior design layout
so successfully. Yes, I know the 911 is a very successful race car but
the reality is that race cars and street cars are not a fair comparison(
the GT-1 is mid engined and water cooled - hardly even remotely related
to a 911).
Any engineer will tell you that an air cooled engine has inherent
limitations that have finally forced Porsche to go to water cooling. I
suspect they would have done so long ago if their marketing department
would have let them. 
The 911 is a fine automobile despite its limitations, primarily because
of the dedication and expertise of Porsche's engineers. Anyone that
would look down on another Porsche because it isn't air cooled is either
someone who prfers a vehicle for its historical roots, or is simply
ignorant of the engineering realities.
