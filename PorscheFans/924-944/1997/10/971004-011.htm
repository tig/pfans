I drove a 924 Turbo and 944 for over a decade in the winters in Summit
County, Colorado and in Michigan.  My favorite tire was the Comp T/A
M+S.  Beacaue of the nice balance of weight between front and rear, the
car got around just fine in the winter.  I am not saying that it is as
good as 4WD, but the ONLY time I ever got stuck was when I was
practicing (some called it playing) with the car in skids.  If driven
with common sense, the car was fine (and predictable) in the winter. 
There were times that I had snow coming over the front of the hood and
still had good enough traction to get where I wanted to go in the high
country.  Blizzacks are one of the best tires for snow and ice that I
have ever used, but I never did use them on my 944.
