I have noticed that everyone seems to be talking about their 944's 
whining

after having the belts re-done. I had to have mine replaced about 5 
months ago

My balance shaft belt broke while driving (luckily it didn't rip off 
the camshaft belt

so much for the PO's assurance he had the belts done)Plus we 
discovered my

camshaft belt was missing a two inch section of teeth!!!

Anyways, after getting new belts and replacing all the pulleys (they 
supposedly

last 100k miles and my car is at 110k) I noticed that I had a whine. I 
took the

car back to my mechanic and he told me that it is a characteristic of 
the  944

to whine. So my comment is don't worry, its normal and the only reason 
our previous

belts didn't whine is because they were old. (I trust the 
mechanic--he's my neighbor too!)



anyway, hope this puts some worries to rest.
