I'm sending this again since I was bumped from the list and the first
attempt was rejected.

     I experienced the same thing in Houston until switching to
Interstate 
     Batteries.  They are a bit more expensive but do go the distance.
It 
     is necessary to check the electrolyte level from time to time and
top 
     off with distilled water if needed.  I also have more than 4 years
on 
     a replacement Porsche battery in my 944.

Man...  I can't believe I've been driving my car for a year and I just
found you guys.  Damn friendliest bunch of high tech gear heads I've
ever encountered (I mean that with the greatest admiration).  Great
information and entertaining.  

Thought I'd chime in and give my thumbs up to Interstate batteries.  It
seems that every car I have ever owned has required a replacement
battery.  As long as I always replace them with Interstate batteries, I
have never bought more than one battery per car.
