Hi, P-Fans,
I´m new (2 days) in this forum, but I´m loving it.
I own a 83 924 and I have a question that I hope someone of you can answer.
I have already some opinions, and I think that all are reasonable, but I´d
like to know other ideas.
When I go fast with the car, usualy more than 180 Km/h (100 miles/h ?) or
in sharp bend, and turning right, I can notice a faillure in the oil
pressure, and it becames normal again. If I have the oil level on the max
mark, or a litlle more, this problem is not so obvious. Someone have
sugested me that it can be a wrong deepstick, or a problem in the oil
pickup. Another opinion was that was only a electrical fault of the gauge
(once the red warning light in the dashboard have even lighted - so I´m
afraid that the problem is not only in the gauge).
I´m not an experienced mechanic, and in the region I live there are any
experienced person in Porsche. So, in order to avoid too much costs with
experiences, taking off the sump and so on, I would like to hear some of
you who experienced the same or have any sugestion.
