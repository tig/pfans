First I'd like to thank all who emailed me with suggestions on my stuck =
spark plug. To be honest I tried everyones suggestions, even some I =
heard as "home remedies" but none worked and I found out why. It appears =
that some hack shop did a tune-up on it about 18 months ago and they =
cross threaded the # 4 spark plug in the head so its scheduled next week =
to go in and get a heli-coil put in the head. Now on to new buisness.... =
has anyone ever put in the thermo time switch in a 924 turbo. This =
appears to be my starting problem so Im going to try to take care of =
this before it goes into the shop. One last thing...does anyone know of =
any companies which still produce preformance parts for the 924 Turbo. =
Ive had little luck in finding any information from anyone in my area =
and as for catalogues, I'm still waiting for most of them to come in. =
Again thanks to all for the help and keep the shiny side up...Kevin
