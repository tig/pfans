I recently got my new '87 944S to replace the one I wrecked this summer.  It
looks great and seems to run, shift and drive very smoothly, however I have
another week or so to get it inspected.  The problems I see are:

1) The odometer is not turning nor is the tripodometer.... does anyone here
know how to fix this or what costs may be involved.  I could send it to VDO
in California but I don't want to wait that long for the shipping.  Does
anyone know anyone in the Baltimore/Washington area (or closer than
Calfornia) that could fix this problem?

2) When I push down over the right, front wheel the shock seems to compress
rather easily for the first few inches and there is also a bit of a "clunk". 

Any help or insight would be much appreciated!!!....... thank's in advance
