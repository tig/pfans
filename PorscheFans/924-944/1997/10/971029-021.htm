Porsche tribe:

Need help from a tribal elder. 

 Recently bought new hood shocks/struts and can't seem to get them
installed.  Apparently you need to be Hercules to push these things in 
in order to line them up to mount them.  Even the old ones are hard to
get back in.  Can't raise the hood sufficiently to line them up either
and it doesn't matter which angle of attack I try (installing top or
bottom first) there's no way these things are going in. 

So what gives?  There's gotta be a trick that I'm missing 'cause
something's not right here.  Now I know what you guys are
thinking,..geez is this guy stupid or what..can't even install some hood
shocks.  Well frankly that's true, but I don't seem to have any problems
on the bigger maintenance items by myself like master cylinders, or A/C
compressor problems...  So can anybody tell me what the trick is on this
round hole square peg problem?  LOTIA! (Lots of thanks in advance) 
Yeah, really enjoyed the Brits post too.  ;)
