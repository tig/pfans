Looks like I'm hosed.  I had about 1/4" of waterpump bolt sticking out and
soaked it most of the day with penetrating oil - even went by and tapped it
once in a while with a hammer.  No luck.  ViceGrips would not budge it.

I got the die grinder out with the cut-off wheel.  I cut the bolt off about
1/16" from the block, being very careful not to even nick the surface the
waterpump mates to.  I popped the bolt dead center with a punch and drilled
it using a 7/64" bit - being extremely careful not to go deeper than a 1/4"
- 5/16" as I didn't want to drill past the end of the bolt and into the
cylinder.  From the indentation of the water jacket I figured it is about
5/8" or more to the cylinder.  I used two different types of easy outs but
it wouldn't budge and I didn't want to snap off an easy-out in the bolt.  

I figured I'm at the point where I'm going to have to use a heli-coil so I
kept upping the drill size in 1/64" increments.  I went to 9/64" and was
right at the point where there shouldn't have been much of the bolt left,
just a thin barrel with threads.  I used a slightly bigger easy out and it
still won't come out.  Has Porsche ever heard of NEVER-SIEZE, sheesh.

I shot some more penetrating oil in the hole and shut the hood.  I'll get
back to it tomorrow.  If it won't come out I'll just drill the 1/4" hole,
tap it, and use an M6 heli-coil with some lock-tite.  I have lots of
experience with them so it shouldn't be too bad.  Then when I install the
new waterpump I'll make sure I don't go nuts torquing that bolt (btw, does
anyone know the torque specs for the waterpump bolts?).  I'll even mark the
head so I'll remember which one it is.

Murphy's Law sure is kicking my ass on this job!
