Ed. -
    There are a few things bothering me about C & D.

1) After reading Brock Yates column this month (Nov. 97) I can safely
say he is an idiot.

2) The ed. who responds to the letters is an obnoxious twerp whose
mother did not spank him enough when he was a child.

3) Is there any way you could come up with a less interesting test than
one involving a Porsche, Viper, Corvette, NSX, 3000GT, and Supra Turbo.
Half of these cars arent even in the same class...I guess if the
insurance companies insure them as sports cars that is good enough for
you, right??

4) This has been bugging me for a while (see also #3)  why in the world
would anyone want an NSX?? I mean for 80 grand you get a f***ing Honda.
It is not that fast, doesn't stop that well, doesn't look that great,
the top squeaks over bumps, and sure as hell doesn't make MY heart race
the way a Viper does (and surely not the way a Ferrari or Porsche
does).  Do you have any idea how fast your Z-28 could be for $50,000 in
modifications.  While we are at it, why would anyone want any sort of
tuner mustang or camaro??

5) Is there any way C&D could write another editorial about air bags?? I
mean 5 straight months just isn't enough.  I bet when seatbelts became
mandatory you guys had about a year's worth of editorials about them.

6) Finally, I am just absolutely pleased as can be that my subscription
is almost over and I NEVER have to look at another C&D again.  I have
never read a magazine as whiny as yours and I never will again. Thank
God for Road and Track!!!

p.s. I realize that instead of listening to this letter (if published)
you will try to make me look like an idiot but it doesn't even matter.
