Hi all,

Well just ordered a replacement cylinder head for my 931, should arrive
tomorrow, touch wood! Anyway the guy's a 930 MotorSport where I am buying
it from also offered my some replacement head studs. There comment to me
was that the originals have a tendency to stretch! Is this true? should I 
change them as well? Comments anyone.

On a side note, Rather liked talking to the guys at 930. The have several
mods for the 931's and are developing a charge cooler for them. Sounds like
something Ill investigate when my bank balance has recovered. :) However
looks like the next item to be upgraded will be the cooling system, as 
all indications of cause for the cracked head are pointing to heat stress.
(Too many horses, not enough water!)

Cheers

Richard.  (931 Dead with a cracked head!)
