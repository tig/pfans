I would guess oil cooler seals. Your mechanic can help you eliminate or
isolate head and/or head gasket via a CO sniffer in your overflow tank...

Good Luck!

    Subject: Head gasket, cooler seals, cracked head?


    Ok, well here's my newest concern.  First thing in the morning, when I
start the car I get a really rough idle for about 3 seconds and white smoke
from the exhaust for about 15 seconds.  If I rev it up it belches it out
quicker, but looks like a cloud.  It stops when the engine is warm and
doesn't seem to smoke at all except on a cold startup.  If I put my hand
near the exhaust when it's doing this, my hand gets the sooty residue on it
(none when the engine is warm), which doesn't feel oily at all.  It seems
more like water.    Also have brown residue floating in the coolant tank
(loses coolant at a rate of about a quart per week).  It also seems to be
losing oil.  So here are the things I think it could be and would like input
from other, more knowledgable P-fans.
    1)  A blown head gasket which allows coolant into one of the combustion
chambers when the engine is cool, but seals when the engine is warm.
    2)  Bad seals in the oil cooler, which allows water in the oil that
burns off when the engine is run (not sure this one makes sense to me,
because wouldn't it smoke all the time?)
    3)  Cracked (ohgod dare I say it?) head, that seals when the heat
expands the metal.

    Ok, none of that would be good news, but are there any other
possibilities?  How can I narrow it down to what is actually wrong?

    Thanks Pfans, and what ever happened to our shirts?
