	haha... so true, but worst yet, its the insurance companys scape
goat.  I bought a car for 8500 (9100 or so after tax and all that other
stuff), and some guy totaled my car by rear-ending me while I was at a
complete stop at a stop light.  I had the car for less than a month (~29
days actually).  The insurance comp. told me their books said it was
worth only 7400.  I called the car dealer I bought the car from, and he
told me I paid under the going value for the car (it was a trade-in)...

But loosing $1100 or so is less than the cost of taking them to court...
so ripped off yet again.
