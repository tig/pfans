Sure, we did a modification which reminds one of the river-fording Range
Rovers. On the right side of the vehicle we had an exhaust pipe going
straight up right behind the front wheel.  On the top of the pipe we had
that flap you see on farming equipment to keep water out when the vehicle
was parked.  On the left side we had the air filter canister.  The car
looked like an 18-wheeler with the two pipes being symmetric to the long
axis of the car.  While we were at it, we threw out the catalytic
converter so it sounded good, too. 

With such a conversion and a good LSD (like a Quaiffe) one should be able
to cross water or rivers deep enough to reach the top of the wheels with
no problems.

(I ought to save this post for April Fool's Day :-) Mr Koch, this message
is not meant to be dis-respectful to you, I just felt the need to be
humorous.)
