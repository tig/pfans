    Well spank me with the sorry stick.  After my recent flame of Tweeks
over my flex dam I checked my records only to discover that the part had
actually been ordered through a different company (in my repentance I have
decided to not flame anymore suppliers)  I also discovered that Tweeks was
the company I bought a dash cap from.  When it cracked shortly after
installing it I called them and they asked if the temp had fallen below
Zero (f) for any length of time.  I thought here we go but admitted that it
had.  The reply was OK we have had problems with that.  They shipped me a
replacement the next day and apologized for my inconvenience.

    In regards to the recent comments over snobby 911 owners I have found
here in the heartland they seem to be a rare breed indeed.  I have yet to
be snubbed by one and have had them approach me honking and waving as they
came along side.  I am sure my day will come but around here people do not
seem to have the "possession worship" I have seen elsewhere.
