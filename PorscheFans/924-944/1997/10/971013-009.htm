In searching for the engine black coolant drain plug I accidentally removed a
large bolt with some type of sensor/valve attached to the end.  It is on the
right side (from the driver's perspective) of the engine block in front of
and above the centerline of the right wheel.  It's just above what looks like
an oil pressure sending unit.  It is a large brass bolt (about 19 mm head)
that tapers into what looks like a pneumatic coupling with an "O" ring at the
end.  I couldn't find it in the Haynes manual.  Any ideas about what it is ?

Naturally, when I tried to replace it the the threads were crossed and
damaged... so I drained the oil from the crankcase and removed it.  How
critical is it to get the threads re-tapped before I replace it ?
