I have to agree with Farzaan. I drive this highway 2 or 3 times a week.
Several close friends have been killed, only one by his own driving. I
talked to someone who witnessed the above and it was as Farzaan described.
This highway sees traffic volumes of about 5 - 7 cars per minute at the
time this happened. It was a disgrace to the PCA that it happened. The
executive of the local chapter is aware of the incident and has expressed
their concerns. I am as guilty as the next person of speeding, but on this
highway never more than 10 - 20 klicks over the limit unless it's 4:00 AM
on a nice summer morning.

BTW Farzaan I have met some nice members of PCA Canada West. It's a small
minority who are 911 snobs. They would be that way no matter what they
drove. I like to think that while they may be jerks at least they have a
nice car. Once they're tired of it it may have come done in value to where
I can afford it. It certainly won't be driven hard and they can obviously
afford to maintain it.
