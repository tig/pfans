I had similar problems as a previous writer was having trouble with
apparent octane related fuel.  It was not the octane but the fuel
make-up.  It was the alcohol content added in these states.  The tanks
are so marked but it`s kind of like finding the tread wear factor on
tires, you know it`s there but you have to really hunt for it.

When I got to Colorado, I had an experience with the 1979 924.  The No.
1 plug fouled at low speeds with fuel.  I adjusted the valves and remade
the ends of the sparkplug wires. The problem seemed to go away for about
100 highway miles but returned when the car was at low speeds.  

I changed the plugs and ran a compression check.  Everything seemed ok.

Same song, 3rd verse.  I bought a bottle of fuel injector cleaner and
put the injectors in it.

Same song, 4th verse.  The car started to burn oil.  I pulled the no. 1
injector and cranked it up.  There was a steady deluge of fuel.  Being
in the desert with minimum tools, I whittled a woodedn stick and plugged
the line and started it up with the injector in hand.  The spray looked
normal for running.

I drove into Conifer, Colorado ok but elected to return to Atlanta via
rental car at $89/day.  It only takes a day at hard driving. After
changing the oil, (no metal chips), the beast continued to burn oil and
there is a trace of piston slap.  I left the car at my daughters.   

I checked into retrieving the car by transport and got prices from $510
to $1400 from the net.
