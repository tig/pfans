     Subject: More Power?
     
     What's the story here?  Is there any reasonably inexpensive way to
     get more power out of a garden variety 944 (Non-S and Non-Turbo)?
     I've been looking around for easy upgrades and haven't found any.
     The only thing that seems to be available is a new chip, but that
     is only 10-15 HP.  Surely the plain 944 is capable of 200+ HP!
     Any thoughts?

     The cheapest way(s) to get more horses outta your engine is to buy a 
     K&N air filter, this will increase the C.F.M. (some measurement of air 
     flow) into the engine by 59% (they have a website or you can order it 
     from performance products). Also, you can buy a throttle response cam 
     (under $25) which increases...ta da! your throttle respone. Those are 
     the cheapest and easiest methods I know of increasing power. If you 
     want the whole sha-bang you might want to consider buying the package 
     offered by performance products which includes the chip, air filter 
     and throttle response cam for around $450. Hope this helps.
