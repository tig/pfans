Barry,

>very big issue, as I must leave myself with funds for tires,
>entry fees, gas, etc.

And then were asking about springs vs sway bars or both. Although others may 
provide more detailed information, I am going to ask if you have had your car 
lowered?  After all, with your ride-height adjustable suspension this may 
provide the least expensive way to decrease body roll by lowering the center 
of gravity. I had mine done last fall and feel it really helped at the track. 
If you do go this route, try to find someone who can also do a chassis balance 
-- this puts equal weight on each wheel and can also be very beneficial.

Does a tubular sway bar mean the bar isn't solid?  If so your bar is 
definately not stock. I believe an "S" model should have 30mm in front as part 
of the M030 sport suspension, but I'm sure someone else will know for sure. At 
any rate, when it comes to bang for the buck, sway bar changes would 
definately be your next step. 

One other problems area to address, even if you keep your stock bar, is to 
beef up the mounting points where the sway bar attaches to the body. The guys 
at Kelly Moss Racing have found a significant about of flex at this flimsy 
mount and offer a diagonally reinforced "L" bracket to make this mount much 
stronger and stop the flexing. This is another change I have found to be 
effective.

>Anything else? What about suspension bushings? Do the 'camberball'
>type devices do anything? 

The "S" does have stiffer suspension bushing than other 944's to begin with, 
but changing to solid mounts offers HUGE improvements in steering 
responsiveness, precision and overall tracking. I have KMR's adjustable camber 
strut mounts at the top and have also changed to solid spherical joints at the 
A-arm mounts as well. It is one of the best changes I've made in my car. 

Initially, I was very skeptical of this revision because I felt it would 
render my car unuseable for the street. But after driving my friend Gary's 
951S with these changes cross-country, those concerns evaporated. As a matter 
of fact, I feel the car was MORE pleasureable to drive on the street because 
of the precision of the response and amazing tracking down the highway. 
Although the ride is a bit more harsh on large, sharp obstacles the ride is 
still quite comfortable in my estimation.

On the track, everyone who has tried our cars agrees... the difference from 
stock is awesome. The car feels very solid and every steering input produces 
and immediate result. Both cars also have Brey-Krause strut braces. (Anyone 
like a Weltmeister brace for $75.)

Will the camberball do anything?  I'm sure it will. That's a big chunk of 
rubber sitting at the top of your strut tower and it's bound to help. However, 
one other advantage to the KMR pieces is they provide a much larger range of 
camber adjustment, and it is easy to switch between street and track settings. 
Just jack up the wheel, loosen four allen screws, slide the strut to the 
appropriate marked location in the slot, and clamp the allen screws back down. 
Takes about 3 minutes a side while changing tires or just jack it up and slide 
it over. 

The KMR Strut Mount is a very well engineered piece and worth the $650 they 
cost. The total cost for the complete front suspension was about $2200 
installed. The A-arms must be machined to accept the spherical joints, so that 
is included in the cost. Plus, KMR's labor rate ($90/hour) is a bit higher 
than most ordinary shops, I believe. But I consider it money well spent and I 
would definately recommend this change to anyone who either drives on the 
track or wants their car to be the best it can be.
