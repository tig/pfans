Bill, you wrote in earlier about the white smoke on startup.  If there
is moisture in your exhaust when you shut the car off, this would be
normal, *but* since you are losing coolant at a high rate *and* since
you have a rough idle on startup, I am almost 100% certain you have a 
leaking head gasket.  Note, it is not blown *yet*, but it will be very
soon.  Tim Stark's 951 with 80,000 miles blew his head gasket the same
way.  Starts car up, runs rough, puffs some white smoke, coolant level
goes down a little bit every day.   All of a sudden, he fires the car
up, it does its usual thing, then moves out of the garage and poof,
tons of white smoke everywhere, head gasket finally blown.  Tim's 951
is APE chipped, not particularly well maintained (as you can see by
him driving the damn thing around with the head gasket leaking for
so long!) and driven at about 6-8 track events with no added race
fuel, *and* he drives the car around on CHEAP gas (like 91 octane
Husky brand!).

Please note that I am not saying that you have not kept up on your car
or anything like that, just wanted to give a profile as to why the
above 951 blew its head gasket.  Complete repair cost the owner C$1400
for the new head gasket.
