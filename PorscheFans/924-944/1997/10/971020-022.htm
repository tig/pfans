I drove a 1991 S2 on Saturday and I also noticed that it had a high
frequency buzz in the shift lever at about 3200 rpm.  I didn't feel the
vibration anywhere else except the shift lever, but I only drove it for
less than 10 miles.  The car I drove had 118,000 miles.  Sounds like this
buzz at 3200 rpm must be inherent to the car.

Before the test drive (courtesy of a local PFans listmember) I thought I
was in the market for an S2.  However, after the drive I'm not sure.
While the S2 did seem to have better torque below 3000 rpm compared to my
son's chipped '89 Turbo, it really felt pretty anemic elsewhere in the
upper rev band.  I was expecting a free revving motor, especially
considering the 4-valve DOHC layout.  So, either the car I drove was a =
bit
on the tired side, or I'm just spoiled with my son's car, my high revving
daily driver Civic VTEC, my highly modified German Capri V6, or maybe all
of above.  In any event, I'd take a solid '89 Turbo any day compared to =
an
S2.

BTW, this new digest mode SUCKS!  It is completely unworkable, especially
when people send the whole darn thing back to the list, or include
imbedded attachments which don't decode properly.  If the existing server
can't handle the traffic I'd gladly volunteer a few dollars for an
upgrade.  With as many members as there are on this list, $5 each would
pay for a nice system.  If we continue to be forced into Digest mode I'm
afraid the list will die.
