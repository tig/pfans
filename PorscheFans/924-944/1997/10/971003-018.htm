I have bought parts and accessories from all of these sources:

Imparts (best source for metal master brake pads and some tools)

Griot's (a few nifty garage items)

Automotion (Owners are local PCA members.  I usually will only buy when they
have a sale, but they've lowered a lot of prices recently)

Performance Products (Good source for Pagid pads when they have their 20% off
sale)

Europroducts

Vertex

Paragon Products (best prices on Koni's, and Jason Burkett is an excellent
person to deal with)

944 Ecology  (George B., another excellent fellow)

Partsheaven (Right up the street, I visit them twice a month)

Easy (rock bottom prices)

All have been pretty good.

My favorite place tp buy most parts is Carlsen in Palo Alto.  I buy from
Linda Grigsby, who I believe is the number 1 sales person for PCNA
nationwide.  You can also get great help from Marty or Mike.  They will beat
anyone else's prices on most everything, and in a pinch, they get
oem-equivalent aftermarket parts when the factory ones are unavailable or too
expensive.

I have 2 or 3 924/944 parts booklets which I got at no charge from Carlsen.
