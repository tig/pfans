Today I took off from a stop sign rather fast. Then when I go to shift into
second, VROOOMMMM!!!! RPM's go WAY up. I let the clutch out and the car
continued to accelerate.. I turned off the ignition, turned on the hazards
and pulled over. The pedal was stuck to the floor, I can pull it up with my
foot, but as soon as i push the pedal more than half way it goes to the
floor and sticks there. I got home by tying my radar detector cord to the
pedal and pulling on it to release the gas pedal. Has anybody had this
problem before and how did you fix it??? I have to drive my truck until I
fix it, so TIA if you know!
