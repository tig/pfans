My competition car is a much-modified 951.  It has a pretty aggressive
suspension, and is a full weight car @ 3,000 lbs.  I run 245/45 16 in all
four corners for track and AX.  Here is my experience with tires:

Hoosier Road Race Compound:

Bought one set of these last year.  Went through the fronts in ONE DAY of AX.
 Went through the cord and actually blew a tire.  Several friends have had
catastrophic failures on the track.  AThe tires are very fragile, and should
not be driven on the road.  As you may know, they do not have steel belts--
only fiberglass.  Talked to Bruce Foss at Hoosier.  He admits that the tires
are fragile and take some getting used to.  They are very easy to flat spot
until you get used to them, and if you do flat spot them, they are done for.

Grip-wise, they are the best, outside of the Goodyear GSCS, which are very
expensive.  About 1-2 seconds per lap better than the BFGs.  Set-up wise,
they like a lot of negative camber: 2-4 degrees.

Toyo Proxes:

Last forever.  I scored six of these FREE!!! at the IMSA races at Sears
Point, taken off some BMW race cars.  They had 1-2 heat cycles on them, and
had been shaved when new.  I have put maybe 8-10 more cycles on them and they
still look the same as when I got them.  They too like a lot of negative
camber: 2-4 degrees.  They are a bit brutish on the track and not very good
for AX, but track lap times are only a bit slower than the BFGs.  Since I got
these rascals free, I want to use them up, so I run 'em for the first 2-3
sessions of a track day, before I put on the BFGs.  A reasonable compromise
if you do a lot of laps, and can drive better than your friends on BFGs or
Hoosiers.

BFG Comp T/A R1

I have purchased about 5 sets of these this year.  They are very consistent,
but can wear prematurely if you flat spot them or run the pressures too low.
 They are the best tires with modest camber: 1.5 - 2.5 degrees, and are thus
not as sensitive to set-up.  I recommend these for most people with these
cars as they are a good compromise between grip and wear.  I have had to toss
a few tires prematurely ruined by flat spotting, et cetera, but that is not
the tire's fault.  I wish they would last longer, but I am glad that they are
gripier than the Toyos and not as touchy as the Hoosiers.  Incidentally, you
can run 245/45 16 BFG R1s on 7 inch rims on '87 and later 951's (for example
Club Sport rims).  They just barely fit, as they are narrower than most 245
tires.  They are hard to mount, but they fit and help with understeer.

I have ten different competition wheels I use when the street tires are not
on the car, and change frequently for AX and track events.  I pay close
attention to wear vs. performance, because I am not rich, and for safety
reasons.  I have a few times (unfortunately) sent my wife out on corded
tires, by not staying on top of things at the track, and since the R1s have
steel belts, she has come out of it okay (albeit with slower lap times).
 With the Hoosiers, she would have gone off, as several of my friends have.
