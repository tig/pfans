I will find the MS Word document on it and forward it to you.  I do not
remember if it was a simple as a relay swap.  This came up a few months
ago and a list member had a great writeup on it.  I feel it would be
inappropriate to send it to the list due to BW concerns, etc., so if
others are interested, please let me know.

Are you talking about the programmable "relay" that can be found on VWs
and Volvos or just the one with the constant amount of delay?  Either way,
I have not done the conversion, but if one was planning to, it might be
worth the trouble to check out the programmable relay (available at least
on some of the A3 (1994-current) VWs).
