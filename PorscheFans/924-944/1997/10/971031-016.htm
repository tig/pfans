Hi Bob, 

I've been using the Halmeter for the last season ( I bought this chipped
89 951 last fall with a blown gasket) and did not see any problems by
using the sensor's signal. I can only tell you that I feel more secure
at looking at the meter and being sure that the fuel is going in the
engine at the proper ratio. 

On the other end, if you're not doing any modification to your engine,
then I would say that buying that meter is money in the garbage. 

Hope it helps

Ciao.
