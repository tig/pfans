	I know there has been some discussion regarding
boost control on the 951's ,so I thought I would add my 
question.
    Is it possible to use an electronic boost controler such as
an HKS EVC ,or a GREDDY PROFEC on the 951???   These work very well on
Japanese car and pretty much eliminate
the "boost spike" you get with the stock 951 set up.  My '89
951s with Autothority stage 2 would "spike" at 16-17psi and them drop back
to about 14.5 psi.  Without the "spike" it would probably be possible to
run 16psi all the time.  I am
pretty sure it is this "spike" overboost that killed 2 head gaskets!!!!!
  Also ,how about an upgraded blow off valve (compressor by-pass) ???? 
They sound great ,but will they help keep the turbo spooled up on the
951's???

Thanks

<x-fontsize><param>9</param>Dear Bill Shook et al:


	Worked in places that have made me quite bitter, so I=20

can relate positively to Bill venting his spleen. And, to prevent being

sent to my room, I'll keep my pro-Union sentiments to=20

myself. (Other than letting you know I have them ;>) )


AFA Porsche clutch prices: BMW clutches come

=46rom Germany and must suffer the same indignity of

US tarrifs (which I think are 6%) on Euro goods as does Porsche.

635 CSi clutches run around =24250. Go figure.


Too, the dollar is up about 15% against the Mark, so

even if the harsh, mercantilist, self-serving policies

(Argh=21 Stop me before I become Liberal again=21)...Like

I was saying, the dollar's up, so tarrifs are precious

little advantage to any American worker. Which is

why 1998 Japanese cars all have prices lower than

last year and VW can sell the new Passat for =2421k.


And, in the larger scheme of things: one industry's=20

protectionism is another's defense against predatory

pricing. Ask Cray computer...


All this macroeconomic drivel aside, Porsche charges

a lot more for parts than many other manufacturers,

IMHO.=20


Not a flame, merely another point of view, worth=20

not much more than =24.02 (If that...;>) )


Regards,

Gary
