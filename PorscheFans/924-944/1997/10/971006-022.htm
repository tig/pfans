Subject: Erratic 944T idle

I am new to the digest so hopefully someone can help me out...

I have an 87 944T(951) that experiences an increase in idle speed up
to around 1900rpm.  When the idle increases, the rpm rises but the
boost gage does not move.  The car will also want to lurch forward
under compression while driving occasionally (very annoying).  The
lurch feels similar to the acceleration of the cruise control, but is
jerky.  The car is stock except for an Autoauthority Stage 2 chip and
conical K&N air filter.

Two events seem to precipitate the condition, especially both in
combination:
1.	If the car is has been shut off and re-started or
2.	In hot weather

I live in the Seattle area so the weather really doesn't get above 90
more than a few days a year.  The dealer has tuned the car to take the
upgrades into account and says everything checks out.  I have never
been able to get the car to perform the condition while at or being
driven by a mechanic.

I have researched this and can't find reasonable explanation and the
dealer cannot explain it either.  Is it simply a bad chip?  Any
comment(s) or help would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I am looking for a set of C2 7.5 & 9x17" wheels in
excellent/good condition with or without tires.  Would be willing to
trade my 7 & 8x16" polished flat dish wheels with center caps in good
conditions.  My tires are toast.

Mike,
It doesn't sound to us like it's the chip.  Why don't you give us a call, 
though, and we'll see if we can't help you to diagnose your problem.  Tech 
support is extremely difficult over the phone, but it is even worse over 
the internet.
