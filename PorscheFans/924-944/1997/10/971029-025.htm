In a perfect world this might exist, but most regions don't know what
events they are going to put on or when until mid/late January maybe later
for more relaxed regions.  I know in the local area, San Francisco bay
area, that we usually have a swap meet in April, one in May or June and
another in August.  But until those that are going to put on the events
step forward at the various regions activities days, the dates are not
quite set until then.  And even then, various dates are moved around 
when the race tracks/autocross sites availability comes to light.

PCA doesn't coordinate individual regions events or dates.  With over 126
regions that would be more than a full time job.  Some regions have their
multi-region events listed in Panorama under Upcoming Events but that
usually only covers a period of about two or three months from the date of
the issue of Pano. 

The best advice I can give you is to periodically ask the list for dates
various memebrs might know about.  You might want to subscribe to the
other various lists (for a week or so) so as to give the broadest coverage
when asking your question. 

Good luck,
