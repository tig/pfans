I installed the same gizmo and the instructions are extremely vague and misleading. The instruction make it sound like a complicated adjustment. After I looked at the 85.5 and later system it was so simple to adjust that I thought I must be missing something. Don't pick on a guy for being careful!

As to the 'not doing anything' statement the cam has made heel toeing much better. Unless you have no sense of touch there is no loss of precision. I found that I can regulate the throttle as well or actually better than before. Previously there was too much of a range of movement from full throttle position to braking position to be precise. now the brake pedal and accelerator pedal can be operated by ankle movement only with out moving your heal.

It doesn't make more power (Obviously) but it does improve the driver vehicle interface. It's pretty cheap too!

Hmmm, waxing doesn't increase hp maybe I should stop spending money on that too! 

Chris White....just couldn't resist

PS 85.5 and later cars do not need to 'pry' anything. Just make sure the plastic pedal stop under the accelerator pedal is adjusted so that you don't stress the cable and the throttle assembly. The white plastic stop has to be adjusted quite a bit.
