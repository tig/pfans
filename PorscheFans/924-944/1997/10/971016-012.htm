And, as I posted some time ago, there is yet another alternative.
Dave Turner (long time national autocrosser) makes and sells what he calls
a "Harness Holding Strap", to work in conjunction with the Porsche
high-back sport seats.  It is designed to help keep the shoulder harnesses
from slipping off your shoulders.  It is best used with some type of
harness bar.  Cost is about $25.  For more information, you can request his
catalog by contacting:
	Performance World
	San Diego, Ca
	800-854-6640
	619-571-3811	(current a/c in '92-might have changed)
	619-571-2859 (fax)
I have no financial interest in either the product or the supplier, but
have happily used this particular product for the last 11-12 years in my
'83 944NA and '88 944 Turbo S.
