Just an update.  I got a few emails from folks wanting to know how
difficult the waterpump replacement is.

I'm happy to report there is nothing to sweat.  It is very straight
forward.  The way some of you guys out there talked about getting the
crankshaft bolt off had me worried.  But I locked down the flywheel, put a
12" breaker bar on it, gave it a tug and there was a small pop and it
unscrewed without any problems.  

I didn't get it finished today.  I got interupted a zillion times by wife
and neighbors.  Then I took off the old pump and went to install the new
one - WRONG PUMP.  They gave me a 951 pump.  It has a couple extra brackets
and another hole.  I guess for the cooler.  So I'll have to return it to
Automobile Atlanta on Monday.  Its going to be interesting trying to find a
944 waterpump on a Sunday tomorrow.  I'll probably have to wait until
Monday.  So much for getting it back together this weekend.

I checked the tension on my belts before I pulled them off.  Both were set
to 2.5.  They are only 25k miles old and they looked in great condition. 
But they're getting replaced and all the rollers too.  My crankshaft seal
is leaking a bit but I got a new seal kit.  Decided to go ahead and replace
all the hoses too.    

Hopefully I can get this thing back together tomorrow.  I miss driving it
already!
