'Mornin,

On the thread of "Loving the Porsche more than my wife", I must just add
insult to injury.  I also race dirtbikes, drag bikes and sportbikes.  I
spend an easy 20-30 hours a week in the garage tweeking, washing, repairing
and pampering my "kids".  Then I am at one race or another on weekends.  I
am fortunate to have a very independant wife, and we have been friends for
12 years before getting married, so she knows exactly what I am like (why
she married me, who knows..=/ ).  But any way, whenever she wants my time, I
give it to her, willingly.  She lets me do so much with my hobbies that if I
need to miss an event once in a while to do something that she wants, so be it.

Next, people have been sure hard on those looking at automatic porsches.
Isn't Porsche ownership about the love of our cars?  That love includes more
than just shaving 1/10 off our track time.  I love my 924.  With the money I
have invested, I could have bought a considerbly faster 944 S2, but thats
not the point.  I am building my car, it is taking on a personality of its
own.  If someone wants to own an automatic porsche and love and care for it,
GREAT!  Maybe that person is not a racer, or even one that drives it hard.
That does not mean that he/she won't love that car just as much as us "racer
boys".  Our advice to them should be in making them aware of this fact, but
if they choose that it is fine for them, lets support them.  Anything behind
a Porsche crest, is a REAL Porsche.

Jay
