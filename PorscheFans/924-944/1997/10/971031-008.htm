Hello Everyone,
I'm new to the list so I apologize if this question has been asked
before.  I have been looking through the archives, but have not come
across anything about the S2 chip.  I own a 1990 944S2 and was wondering
if anyone with an S2 has added an AutoThority performance chip.  I've
heard that their chips are the better ones.  AutoThority is saying that
their chip will add about 38hp.  Does this chip really add more hp, or
just move it from the top end down to the lower and middle rpm range. 
I've changed my stock air cleaner with one for K&N.  The stock air
cleaner box was removed ( K&N doesn't make an air filter for the S2 stock
box ) and a new K&N filter was added to the air intake tube under the
front valance panel.  Big difference in acceleration at low and
especially at higher rpms (4000 - 6000).  There is more noise up front (
i.e. air being sucked in ), but what a difference.  Highly recommended
change for the S2s.
Also my thanks to Gregor for the info. on the fog light mod.  I had no
trouble with his instructions on my 944S2.  Will mod. the fog lights on
my 85.5 944 N/A this weekend.
Thanks in advance.
