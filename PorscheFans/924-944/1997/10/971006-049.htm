I agree with Chris that the throttle response cam is a worthwhile
improvement.  Rather than spending the bucks, I modified my stock cam by
cutting off the arm, filing out the groove with a small circular file, and
redrilling the hole for the cable end pin.  It worked like a charm.

I don't know if any of you all have experienced this problem (I'm somewhat
new to the list), but one day the cruise control on my 85.5 stopped working.
After much anxiety and testing, I discovered that a brake light bulb was out.
 Evidently, the break in the light circuit made the computer think the brakes
were on, thus cutting out the cruise control. I was amused a few months later
to see that a long article on diagnosing cruise control probelms in one of
the Porsche mags didn't mention this.  I learned long ago (about the time I
had kids!) that with P cars it's best to start with the cheapest solutions
and work your way up.
