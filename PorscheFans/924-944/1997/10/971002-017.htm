Hi All,

I recently joined the list and first of all I'd like to say that I am
totally blown away by how technically knowledgeable you guys are.  The
typical e-mail message reads like this:

"Hi, Last night I had five minutes to kill before dinner so I decided to
change my 944S2's water pump.  In order to utilize my time most
efficiently, I decided to also remove and replace my 951's entire turbo
installation simultaneously with my feet, being careful to of course use
the 1/16th millimeter gold-plated screws which I ordered from
Zuffenhausen etc.   Needless to say, I was done before supper was on the
table."

If you have no mechanical skills whatsoever, how do you get to the point
where you can tinker with your baby without fear of blowing something
(including yourself) up?  Is formal training necessary or do you just
need a good manual and some tools?  I was under the impression that
Porsches were difficult to work on, especially for novices, but is that
kind of a fallacy?

Anyway, I own a 1987 924S which I bought second-hand in 95.  It's one
sweet machine (No, I would NOT rather have a 911, but I'd love to own a
951 one day).  However, at speeds over around 45 mph the sunroof
flutters opens a crack if the windows are closed and starts whistling a
Neil Diamond tune.  This can be remedied by opening the window a little
bit.  I was just wondering, is this a commonplace problem with the
924S/944 sunroof?  Any ideas for an easy fix? 

Thanks,

Nicolas
