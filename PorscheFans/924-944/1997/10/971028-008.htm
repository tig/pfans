PFans,

        I finally screwed up my courage and read the lemon files. I suspect
that this hits close to home for many of us. While we love to look at and
drive our cars, Porsche clearly has done some things better than others.
Having just purchased a 1990 S2 and being in the process of selling a 1987
911 Targa, the lemon files do provide much food for thought. Can all these
problems be laid to faulty owner maintenance? I don't think so. I was
surprised and upset to find out about the chain tensioner problem in 16V
944s. My car has 80,000 miles and I'm sure it has never been done. Am I
upset that a part can wear out after 80,000 miles, absolutely not. I am
upset that when it wears out it can cause a catastrophic repair and that no
official arm of Porsche's organization warns us about it. I thank the powers
that be that I receive this digest and learned of the problem and my car
will receive a new tensioner this week.

        What the people on the lemon files appear to ignore is the fact that
owning a Porsche is a special experience. I enjoy getting up and driving to
work in my S2 and I just plain enjoy looking at it. I expect it to be a
bigger maintenance car than my old Acura Legend which never had any problems
but was boring to drive. I suspect that many people who cannot afford this
type of car are buying 944s because of the low prices they are being sold
for. I live in Florida and you can buy 944's cheap!!! I paid $9500 for an S2
and the first thing I did when I got it home was have a full maintenance
with belts and all. I expect that a lot of these inexpensive 944's have not
had proper maintenance.

        Finally a problem that many people on both the lemon files and the
digest have in common is the exceptionally high cost of maintenance. I have
never gone to dealers of any kind with my cars but I suspect that going to a
Porsche dealership for repairs or maintenance is a rare treat indeed. Many
independent Porsche repair shops seem to think that they are doing brain
surgery. While it's true that 944s and 911s have some areas that require
special knowledge, changing brakepads is just not that tough. Many of the
people working on Porsche's have a special disdain for Porsche owners taking
the attitude "If you can't afford unlimited expenses you shouldn't own a
Porsche". They rarely make any efforts to buy parts at reasonable prices.
Porsche prices for parts on the other hand are a disgrace. I was quoted $800
for the infamous glov box door and $375 for a shift knob and boot. What's
the answer? I have found one that works for me. After much searching I have
found an excellent maechanic who charges $50.00 per hour and allows me to
buy my own parts. I buy the parts through Vertex with whom I have done
several thousand dollars worth of business with no problems whatsoever. You
can buy a set of OEM rotors and pads for a 911 for $268.00 and with about 3
hours of labor for $150 you have a total of $410.00 which is about what it
costs to do brakes on an Acura Legend.

        Owning a Porsche should be fun, not a misery. The issues are clearly
complicated with no clearcut answers. My hopes for my own ownership are to
have some fun while not having to take out a second mortgage. This probably
takes a little more effort with Pcars than with others, but I think it's
worth it.
