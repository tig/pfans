I have a similar vibration problem, I was planning on attacking it when I 
replace the rear main seal (the one and only oil leak left on my engine as I 
have replaced all of the other seals). I plan to have the flywheel 
re-surfaced, and was hoping that would solve it. It is independent of vehicle 
motion, clutch position, etc.. so I know it is coming from the engine and/or 
clutch assemblies. Has anyone had and solved a similar vibration problem? I 
can also feel the vibration through the clutch pedal while depressing it. I 
have checked the drive shaft for rotational play, which would be an indication 
that the clutch center is going, no play. An unrelated symptom, when the 
transmission is in neutral, and the clutch is engaged spinning the drive shaft 
in the torque tube, I can hear bearing noise. I have been dismissing this as 
5th gear idler noise as described in the FAQ, but will also be checking it 
out. Hopefully my drive shaft bearings are ok, but with >235,000 miles on it, 
I wouldn't be to surprised if the bearings are a bit worn.....

Thanks,
       Ezra
