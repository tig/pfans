Mike,
	Sounds like you are on the right track.  The cross member is what I use to
support the car for this job.  I don't remember what I used for the gasket
sealer.  A couple of other things though.

	Consider removing the radiator since it is easily done.  Although not
required, the extra 6 inches of room will be appreciated while doing your
work.  You can flush the radiator with a hose while it is out.  Maybe even
replace the thermo-switch ($15) while you at it since they fail at the
worst times.

	I don't know what A.A. includes in their seal kit but you should have 4
seals, 2 O-rings and 2 paper thin clear seals.

	Make sure you have the twelve point triple square tool for the cam bolt.

Good Luck,




Stu
