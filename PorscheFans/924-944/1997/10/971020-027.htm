One man's trash is . . .

I find this dash refreshingly simple and efficient.  Compared to the jet-
fighter dashes of most japanese cars, I much prefer the small dash
of the 944 and 911 cars than the techo-wonder head's up display
dashes.

I don't know why everyone is complaining about dash darkness.  I have
mine set on full bright and it is more than adequate.  I have noticed that
Paul's is darker than mine, which leads me to believe he has a bulb burnt
out or a low battery or something, but his is still fine.

And, anyways, to me the only gauge I need so see at night is the boost
gauge, and it's the closest one to the bulb :)

In most japanese cars, I feel like I'm sitting in a bathtub (being only
5'5", in the 944 or 911's, I feel like I'm actually in control of this
damn thing :)

>cheap and overpriced they made it!  Don't get me
>wrong, I enjoy the car very much.....

That's what I like to hear!!!
