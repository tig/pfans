I have a few questions regarding my 86 951.  Maybe the group can help me =
out.

1)  Would anyone care to recommend jack stands that work well with the =
"jack points" listed in the owners manual?  Are there other suitable =
places to support the car on jack stands?

2) What are the best workshop manuals to get for this car?  Who has the =
best price?

3)  What is the skinny on timing belts.  How often do you guys replace =
them?  I know that they should be re-tensioned once a year or ever 15k =
miles.

4)  This car was raced by the previous owner.  It has several mods; KKK =
29 turbo, lowered,  konis etc.  He also used neoprene  bushings when he =
replaced the rear torsion bar.  The things squeak like crazy.  Anyone =
experienced this problem before and is there a simple solution?  How =
difficult is it to replace the rear bushings?

Thanks!

-Tom
