951 CV Joints

As many of you may know, Porsche used at least two different types of CV
joints and half shafts in the 951 cars we got here in the U.S.  As far as I
can tell, the cut-off occurred sometime in the 1987 model year.  My '87 car
was built in late 1986 and has the older style, while my '89 car was built in
the Spring of 1989 and has the newer style.  You cannot mix the CV joints and
the half shafts-- the spline patterns are different.

I frequently autocross the '87 car which has a suspension system that
includes some Club Sport and Turbo S parts.  I also drive it on the track
about 15-20 days a year.  Lateley I have been having trouble keeping the CV
joints from coming loose (actually the bolts back off).  I have also had a
major catastrophic failure during an AX run. At Candlestick Park we have a
lot of CV problems because the parking lot is so bumpy.  I have resorted to
medium strength Loctite.  So far, so good.

Anyway, I recently "upgraded" my CV joints and half shafts with the later
style.  I bought new CV joints and half shafts from wrecked '89 cars at
Partsheaven (anyone looking for Turbo S parts-- they have two cars with lots
of items left).

Anyway, I would think twice about using the VW CV joints, unless they are
exactly the same Lobro brand parts as the Porsche units.  As far as I know,
Lobro is the oem supplier for the joints.  The part numbers may be the same,
and if so, why not save a few bucks?  But, be careful if they are not, even
if they fit.  Personally, I would not like my wife to have a catastrophic
failure at one of our local track events.
