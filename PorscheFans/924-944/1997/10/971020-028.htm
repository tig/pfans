I've had a 85.5 944 and now have a 952. In both I drive with the dash
brightness as low as it will go. Many people have, I believe, the
instrument lighting far too bright.

In-car illumination levels in front of the driver should be no more (and
preferably much lower) than the levels outside. Eyes adjust to the
brightest light, so if the dash is brighter than what you're seeing through
the windscreen then you're not seeing everything you could/should outside
the car.

If you need to see the instruments (I rarely do anyway) just flick the
level up for a look. With dash brightness down, you'll be surprised at how
quickly your eyes will adjust and how bright the dim dash will appear to
become... try it sometime. In fact, there have been many times, on un-lit
country roads, where the minimum illumination has been too bright.

The good thing about the Porsche is that the level does go right down. Many
other cars don't and it's like trying to drive while looking past a
Christmas tree.

Just my thoughts,

gb
