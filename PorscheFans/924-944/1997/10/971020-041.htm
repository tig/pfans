Greetings,

I have ended my first season of drivers ed with my '89 951 and the shiny
side is still shiny so I have to consider it a huge success. This car is
simply amazing.

On October 4-7, I attended what may be the last Bridge event, at least
for me. There is still one 'guaranteed' shot left since NNJR will be
having an event in November assuming they can come up with enough
interested people. So give Arlene Novack a call and sign up! 

The "last weekend" at The Bridge was wonderful. It started out a bit
chilly on Friday, but by Saturday the sun had come out and things were
swell. There was one incident early Friday involving the infamous last
left in the valley of the lefts (Station 8 but Turn 9 by my counting).
It has destroyed two cars this year on the tire wall/berm on the
opposite side (drivers left) of the course from the exit. It is sad to
see this kind of incident, but at least nobody was hurt.

On Friday, I had an extremely unusual unusual camera mount. I wanted to
get some incar footage of the possibly historic event, but I didn't have
the opportunity to get a 'real' mount so I talked Barry Lenoble into
doing 'the honors'. The tape is actually pretty good if you don't mind
some really jumpy footage due to the bumpiness of the track and the fact
that Barry was wearing the standard 3-point seat belt. I passed a bunch
of 911s (most of them Turbos) during the filming. Barry turned the video
off just prior to us getting black flagged. But he turned it on again
for a moment after I had resumed driving while he was still standing in
pit lane. It ends at the start of what must have been a classic Don
Coburn speech on the dangers of holding an albeit small video camera to
your eye in an open faced helmet while navigating a track at speed...
Too bad Barry turned it off. It would have been a great highlight. 

On Saturday, red and black run groups were combined for the last group.
I gridded behind my very first instructor, Skip Brown. He drives a 944
Turbo that hasn't been chipped, but it has 8s in the front and some
suspension mods so he's a bit faster in the corners and I'm faster down
the straights. When I started drivers ed we really hit it off to the
point that he was my sole instructor for my first three events. It
really helped me to progress faster because he already knew exactly
where I was in the learning curve, sort of like having a personal ski
instructor for a week of instruction! We had a really fun dice the
entire run group with hardly an interruption from 'backmarkers'. There
were two really close calls with the local population (deer), but they
decided not to intervene. My extra 70 horsepower or so allowed me to
keep right up with him. About half way through the session, he braked
too deeply for turn 5 so he let me by just like it would have happened
if we were racing. I managed to keep it clean the rest of the session so
I finished 'ahead'. It was great. 

On Sunday, the day started with a novelty. Dale Smith and Sue Marsh got
married by a judge who stood on the starters stand while they stood on
the winner's podium. The judge was quite a comedian who took the whole
thing in stride. It was quite a ceremony that will be remembered by
those who attended for a long time capped off with a good luck backwards
lap in Sue's 914. Later in the day I managed to chop a second off my
personal best to a 1:55. But at the same time, Barry Lenoble improved to
a 1:54 so I still have some catching up to do since he drives an
unchipped and totally stock '89 951.

All in all it was a wonderful event. The Metro NY events are
consistently a great combination of safety and fun while being very laid
back with virtually no power trips or control freaks.

Last weekend I attended my first Watkins Glen event with Northern New
Jersey Region (NNJR). Unfortunately, statistics decided to get even and
three cars ended up with body damage. More on that later.

I drove up on Thursday afternoon from Manhattan. My mechanic suggested
I80-I380-I81-17 to minimize the amount of time subjected to local
revenue collectors on 17 using the more traditional NY Throughway. There
were some traffic delays due to construction (and the PA highway patrol
invariably had a radar trap at the slowdown since fines are doubled in
construction zones), but it is probably a better approach, particularly
since there are some 65 MPH stretches in PA. 

As I was getting out of my car at the (in)famous Seneca Lodge (same
mattress that Jackie Stewart used) a fellow and his SO walked up to say
hello. The turned out to be the vanguard of a big contingency of
Torontoans (???) from Upper Canada Region (UCR). I ended up spending
virtually the whole weekend with this extended family since I knew
virtually nobody at the event. I am definitely going to have to visit
Mark Plouth, Linda Bell, Geoff Davies, Jeff Davis (from Michigan), Tom
Brown, Frank DelCogliano, Craig Harrison, Godfrey Cheng and the rest of
the group in their natural surroundings at Mosport. I have to thank them
for showing me so much hospitality and welcoming me into their group.

Since I had never seen the boot of Watkins Glen incar, I was a bit
apprehensive being in the black run group. When I went through tech
Friday, I suggested it may be in everybody's interest to be put into
white. But since they were combinind white and blue , Arlene Novack
wisely decided to leave me in black. It turned out to be a great
decision since red and black are allowed to pass everywhere except the
esses and between 10 and 11. With 180 or so drivers overall, it was a
bit crowded, particularly in white/blue, with long trains forming behind
the slower members and with only three passing zones. I heard more than
one frustrated black driver that had decided to run in white due to
unfamiliarity with the track. By Saturday, most were back in Black where
they belonged.

I asked Arlene to assign me an instructor and she told me to stand
outside my car at the first session and a volunteer would help me out. I
decided to take matters into my own hands and begged George Beuselinck
to provide me with the necessary introduction to the track. He
graciously agreed to help me out by first taking me with him as a
passenger in the red group, the first group out. It turns out that if
taken at a moderate pace, Watkins Glen is like a trip in the country
down some incredibly well paved hilly roads. It is so incredibly scenic
that I had some trouble remembering I was supposed to be learning the
line insted of taking it all in. It is like a country club more than a
race track. It could not be more different from Bridgehampton. The Armco
is immaculate with absolutely no dents or even scrapes. The reason is
that if you damage the track you personally own that much bent Armco to
decorate your previously full garage while your P-car is put back
together (if you are lucky).

But back to learning the track. George had already sent me a great
write-up of all the corners by a gentleman I met but I cannot remember
his name right now - this gentleman even took the clutch hose off his
spare 944 Turbo Saturday night after being at the track all day so that
one of the Canadians could run on Sunday! George convinced me that if I
took my time that everything would be fine. So my first session out was
solo. I did take my time and got passed a lot. But halfway through the
second session, I had the basic line all worked out albeit with extended
braking into some of the more daunting corners (such as Turn 6 at the
bottom of the hill and turn 10 - the turn that always gobbles up the
NASCAR guys - and a big lift before knowing I was set to get a good line
through turn 3 at the start of the esses. In the third session, I was
getting to the point where I could get through the esses with a
momentary confidence lift at turn 2.

Early in the day, a 944 Turbo in the red run group broke a balljoint and
the car went into the Armco in the esses. But thankfully, it was minor
body damage and the driver was fine.

Everything was going great so I decided to scout out another ride. I was
visiting Dale Smith (still on his honeymoon?) who was graciously yet
again running control just as he does for MNY at most of their events.
He hasn't driven since a bad incident in a 356 that rolled while he was
instructing but he still comes out with Sue to nearly every event and
volunteers to do the most important job at the track.

Sitting there next to the control van was a 944 Turbo with slits in the
front nose similar to the 924 GTR. It turns out that is exactly what it
is and the car is owned and operated by Bob Michaelson, who happens to
be the chief driving instructor for NNJR. After asking him about the
nose, I ask him if I can get a ride with him next red session. He says
sure, so I gather my helmet and go for an E-ticket ride. The car is
chipped and the suspension is obviously setup quite well, but I get the
impression the car would still be comfortable on the street. Bob's line
is immaculate and totally consistent. I was having some problems with
the line through the esses at speed but I saw immediately what I was
doing wrong after the ride with him, the road is a bit crowned between 3
and 4 so if you approach 4 late, you have to transition across the rise.
Aha! But I get the nagging impression he has dropped it back a notch to
assure that I don't get too carried away too fast.

As we approached the chicane for the fourth lap, we were passing two
more slower cars. As we approach the braking zone, a silver 993 came
flying out of the chicane exit and smacked the tires and Armco at the
exit of the corner nearly head on and at nearly 100 mph. The car flew 4
or 5 feet into the air and it was shoved back halfway across the track
from the impact before coming to rest. I think my words were "Holy Shit!
Did you see that?" Bob responded, "Yes." Bob slowed the car down and
came alongside. I thought we were going to stop so I was about to
unlatch my belts. There were two people in the car and it appeared they
both had already somehow taken off their helmets and it was clear that
the airbags had deployed. Besides being white as ghosts, they appeared
to be in good shape. We left the scene and came back into the pits
leaving it up to the professional flaggers, medical, and support trucks
to deal with the incident. (Watkins Glen always requires professional
flaggers at their track.)

It turned out the driver was Botho von Bose, the Enthusiast of the Year
at the last Parade. I later found that this was his second very serious
incident in this car. The carbon kevlar drivers seat was bent at a 20
degree angle from the forces exerted on the 3-point lap belt. Twenty or
thirty minutes later, Arlene called a drivers meeting where we found out
that both of the helmets ahd come off (apparently from the airbags), and
one flew out of the window and was found on the other side of the Armco
50 feet from the track. Both were transported to the hospital, but they
were fine with the exception from some head abrasions from the airbags.

That ended day one for me as Black and Blue/White lost their driving
sessions from the cleanup.

On Saturday at the drivers meeting it was stressed again that Watkins
Glen demands full respect from the drivers. The day went well and I was
getting faster and faster as I became more comfortable with the esses
and as I whittled down my braking points. The track is as smooth as a
billiard table. During the very last session of the day (yellow/green),
a 911 went off at Turn 1 right into the Armco. The instructor was one of
the Canadian contingent. I told him that he was very brave to get into
cars of people he didn't know. He told me he used to do that sort of
thing, but not anymore. But the next day he was back at it again...

Funny thing but my helmet bag disappeared while it was sitting with the
rest of my stuff. I keep hoping someone accidently thought it was theirs
instead of the other possibility. But then again, Watkins Glen is open
to anybody who signs the waiver. A tour bus went down the staging line
in the afternoon and I was told to announce that the souvenir stand was
open until 5 PM...

On Sunday, I started the day on the late side since there was a power
failure and the alarm clock was two hours later than usual. I awakened
to a pounding on the door from the maid wondering when I was going to
vacate. Oops! I put my ass into gear and got to the track after a very
quick shower and gas stop at the Sunoco for some 94 octane. NNJR likes
to work with clock like precision so I was expecting some flack when I
confessed to missing the tech and drivers meeting. But they took it in
stride and graciously got me ready for my first session, which was the
very first group. So without even a bit of coffee or even a moment to
catch my breath, I was circulating the track. The morning was magical.
It was quite a bit warmer than it had been on Friday and Saturday (which
was at least somewhat to blame for the incidents), and the dew was
glistening off the well trimmed grass and the session was almost
spiritual.

I worked my work assignment in staging next. It was evident from the
radio traffic that NNJR had taken proactive measures to quell the bent
metal. The big joke was that Arlene would be wearing the testicles of
anybody who stepped out of line. They had instructors around the track
as spotters and they even had some instructors out in cars in the
session behind suspected trouble spots to keep an eye out. All this went
right over my head as I thought I was immune from the long arm of the
safety nazis. During my second session, I got a bit early into 10 and I
got on the sloped part of the curb on the exit of 10. Apparently, that
was where one of the instructors was watching... At least I didn't get
black flagged, but I was pulled over when I entered the paddock area. I
was pretty well stunned by the whole thing so I guess I showed less than
total commitment to mend my evil ways. Ten minutes later, I hear my name
over the PA system to report to the control van. Doh! Bob Michaelson
wanted to have a personal word with me... I had already heard about what
happens when you get on his wrong side, so it was with great trepidation
that I approached the van. He explained quite mildly and methodically
why I should show Turn 10 a big measure of respect. I agreed with
everything he said and I told him that I would show more caution in the
future.

The third session I decided to get a jump on things and go out first
thing thinking I wouldn't get into any trouble that way. As I turned
onto pit out from staging, Arlene Novack pulled out right in front of me
to be the first on teh track. Better to have the cops in front than
behind you, right? I figured how much trouble could I get into mimicking
everything the track chair did? As the session went along, we felt more
and more comfortable in each other's presence so we got going faster and
faster. Then Arlene got into Turn 10 a bit early and got up onto the
curb just as I had in the previous session! I wondered if that
instructor was still there looking on...

She let me by on the front straight just as I would probably have gotten
by her after a bobble if we had been racing. She followed me for a few
laps keeping reasonably close, close enough for some of the flaggers to
give me the blue. Obviously, I immediately gave her the signal and she
signaled she was fine following me for a while. Cool! After a couple of
laps I let her by on the front straight. I followed her for the rest of
the session.

Afterwards, I dropped by and told her I was the other car. We exchanged
some kind words that always make such encounters that much better.

I didn't drive the last session since it was pushed to the end of the
day to shorten the day - most of the people left after the second or
third session. So after standing there vacillating for ten minutes
whether or not to hang out another hour, I decided to bag it and head
for the Big Apple with the shiny side still shiny.
