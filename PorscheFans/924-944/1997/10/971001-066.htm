ok, now where can i get those little plastic thingys?? i ordered some "emblem
fasteners" from performance auto, but they arent any good for the "PORSCHE"
emblem on the back of my 924, i think having the stock type would help on the
hood badge as well, im not looking forward to trying to get a hand in there
to hold the fastener while i press in the badge (my plastic thingys, as well
as the mounting holes fell victim to the bodywork i did before painting,
oops)
thanks,
eric
78-924 no hood badge or little plastic mounting thingys :(
