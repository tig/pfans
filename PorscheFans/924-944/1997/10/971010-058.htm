Hi List,
Well the intermittent boost/power loss problem appears to be solved thanks
to Dean Roberson's post.  I picked up a new valve - the dealer calls it a
cutoff valve - part #993-110-337-50 @$40.83 CDN.  This is now the new part
# since the old one has been superseded by the improved 993 version.  Well!
the car feels like its back on steriods.  The vacuum system on the car
appears to be exceptionally sensitive - a slight leak/malfunction and the
DME shuts down the fun.

>Hi Dean, 
>Mine definitely does not hold vacuum - using a spare vac line. it will not
allow me to blow into the valve, but it will allow me to suck (old exhaust
fumes?) out.  Is this normal?  You did say oral diagnosis was permitted.
BTW The car was not running when I performed this delicate procedure (thank
God).
