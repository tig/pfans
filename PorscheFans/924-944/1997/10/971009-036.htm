<< Toyo Proxes:
 
 Last forever.  I scored six of these FREE!!! at the IMSA races at Sears
 Point, taken off some BMW race cars.  They had 1-2 heat cycles on them, and
 had been shaved when new.  I have put maybe 8-10 more cycles on them and
they
 still look the same as when I got them.  They too like a lot of negative
 camber: 2-4 degrees.  They are a bit brutish on the track and not very good
 for AX, but track lap times are only a bit slower than the BFGs. >>

This mirrors my experience with these tires as well, although I was thinking
I was giving away a bit more to the BFG guys --- dammit!
