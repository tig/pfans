Fans,

Wife versus Porsche? A wife and a Porsche should not be competing but 
complementing each other! It takes two to truly enjoy the pleasures of a 
Porsche. Let me explain.
  My wife had re-entered the work force and was looking for a car when I 
found a pampered 1987 924S. One look and a quick test drive was all it took 
for her to fall in love with it. Laura bought the car and insisted on paying 
for the insurance and any future maintenance. It was a pleasure to oblige.
  Laura doesn't mind how long I spend in the garage keeping her car looking 
good and running smooth. She often asks me to show her different things 
under the hood and explain how they work. It's a pleasure to oblige.
  Laura uses it as a daily driver but on long trips and on major highways 
she asks me to drive because she likes to sit back and enjoy the scenery. 
It's a pleasure to oblige.
   When Laura returns from a road trip on her own --- an out of town 
shopping trip with the girls or whatever---- she is more than eager to show 
her appreciation for the time I spend with her car. It's a pleasure to oblige.
  It takes two to truly enjoy the pleasures of a Porsche.

Doug Bradshaw

PS: complement: to complete or make perfect.
