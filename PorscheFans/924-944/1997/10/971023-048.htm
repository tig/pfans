	Well I just finished a Month and a half long dance with a parts =
supplier in California.  I had ordered an A/C compressor from them and =
they promptly credited my card and then decided that the part they were =
going to send me was defective... (I suppose that should make me feel =
better)  All the while telling me that the part only needed to be =
shipped.  Never once did they tell me the part was not available, just =
yeah yeah yeah it shipped yesterday.   To make this story as short it's =
beginning to look allot like Christmas and I need and A/C Compressor.  =
How stupid does that sound. =20
	I would appreciate any more advice any of you have about Vendors and =
what to do.  Mike M recommended getting a Sandan Compressor...  I'm open =
to suggestions. 
.
