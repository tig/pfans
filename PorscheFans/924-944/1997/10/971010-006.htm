|PFans!
|
|        Some small questions:
|
|        1. Anything to be done about the broken glove box door short of
|buying a new one (which I probably            wouldn't do)?


Buy a used one!!!  :-)

|
|        2. The plastic covering the instrument panel appears to be =
dirty
|from the inside? Is there an easy way            to remove this for =
cleaning?
|

Yes, remove the steering wheel, remove the center air outlet and the =
gauge surround, remove
the instruments cluster and disassemble it, clean the plastic, replace =
all the parts...

|        3. My turn signals while all functioning appear to blink very =
fast.
|Is this normal?

No, not normal... might be a relay or the wrong bulb installed in one of =
the blinker lights.

|
|        4. Has anybody purchased the shifter repair kit for $47 =
advertised
|in the mags? If so is it worthwhile?

Yes, best way to repair a torn or worn shift boot.

|
|        5. Does anybody make a sunshade specifically for the 944?       =
=20
|

Don't know...

|        6. I have looked at seven or eight Turbos and S2's. None of =
them had
|the front spoiler? My guess is            you can't keep one of them =
due to
|the low clearance. Am I right?       =20
|

Yep, made of unobtainium.

|        7. My dash night lighting appears to be very dim when turned up =
as
|high is it can be. Is this typical?

Yes, but you might have burned out bulbs.

Good Luck!
