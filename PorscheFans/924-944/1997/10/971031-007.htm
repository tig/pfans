The cold idle is controlled by two things.  The warm up regulator (
which =
regulates the fuel) and the auxillary air valve (which regulated the =
air).  You can either replace them both, replace one and hope you =
guessed right or get the necessary set up for testing the injection =
system.  Good luck and let me know what you find.  I'm having the same 
=
problem.  BTW, the normal idle should be 925 (+/- 75)

======================================================================

I don't think replacement would be very cost effective; they're 
both easy to test.  First, ensure they are both receiving power by 
measuring voltage across terminal ends on harness.  It might help 
to warm engine first.  You should get charging voltage (13-14 V).

Check your Haynes for the exact test specs, but I think you should 
measure 20 ohms resistance across terminals on warm-up regulator, and 
30 ohms on the aux air valve.  Your problem sounds like an aux air 
valve stuck closed, especially if your car seems to be running OK at 
300 rpm!  

The aux air valve is on top of your engine; it's not too hard to get 
off, and you can test it by heating hooking it up to a 12V source and 
seeing if it closes.  

Good luck.

Greetings, P-Fans:

..02 to add to Ike Moola's Winter Storage
FAQ: 

1. Beware of dessicant. Too much is not
a good thing. Put a huge amount in a 
stored 914 once. Came back a year later
to find 3 inches of water in
the cockpit.

2. Many people use a piece of wood to
hold the clutch pedal in to keep it 
from sticking to the flywheel.

Regards,
gP
