Hi PFans,

I'm looking to upgrade my stock sealed beams headlights to something
of a higher quality. When I had my BMW 320i, I put in Euro spec
lights that used plug-in halogens and had an optic pattern that was
razor sharp flat with a rise to the right. They were great, the sharp
edge allowed me to throw more light down the road without blinding
folks. 

Perusing the major catalogs, the only one that had possibilities was
a Hella unit from Performance Products. I called them up they were
nice but totally clueless. When I asked them about what the beam 
pattern looked like, the woman retrieved the light from stock and 
started telling me how many lines there were on the glass lens.  When
I explained that I was more interested in how they performed, she
told me that they have never installed them or seen them installed
and therefore don't have any idea. And yes, electrical parts are
non-returnable. So much for the "30 day satisfaction guarantee".

So, does anybody have any suggestions? Another vendor? Anybody
tried the Hella's from Performance Products?

Thanks in advance!
