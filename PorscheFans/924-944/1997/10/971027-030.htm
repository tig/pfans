Friends:
   
    For those of you who are not doing the "track" thing, but would like a
beautiful, smooth ride with tons of curves and great roadside views...have I
got the ride for you!

    I shined up the 44, belted the wife (in the seat, come on
guys...jeeze!)...and we went from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Up-State
to Rhinbeck, NY, last weekend.

   We stayed off the Thru-Way and took the Saw Mill to the Taconic, North.
I'm telling you folks..."THE RIDE OF LIFE"!  The roads are completely
smooth...So many curves...few police radar points...unreal views!  

  If anyone lives anywhere near this area, I highly suggest this ride.
Rhinebeck is roughly 100 miles from Manhattan.

  I've driven many, many highways...this was really a fun drive!
