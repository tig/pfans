Just thought I'd let everyone know that I've added the PorscheFans page
as a link to my page in case wandering Porschites stumble across it. 
That way they'll know to talk to you guys to get the real scoop on the
wasserpumper knowledge.  Plus the extra advertising for our list never
hurts.  Considerably more important than the "Speed Racer" link I had on
before, though did leave the image at the bottom for grins.

By the way, never did get any takers on the Mach 5 for a 968 trade. ;)

P.S.  Thanks to everybody that gave advice on my power loss problem. 
Think it was merely dirty and loose battery terminals and cables.  She
held a charge all day without incident.  Will know for sure when I try
to start her tomorrow.
