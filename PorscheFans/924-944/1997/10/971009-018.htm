Lee,

I was looking through some past posting on the digest and found your response 
to the question about how to differentiate between an S and a normal 951 most 
complete!   Nice job. 

I've owned both and '89 and now an '88 S that is one of the later ones and is 
Stone Grey Metallic. The original owner, George LaCasio, had requested info 
from PCNA on August 17, 1988 about the colors and received the following 
information in an Interoffice Memoradum from Porsche. I would like to pass it 
on to you and everyone else on the digest.

	Code			# built		Percentage
	A1A1 (black)		63		8.8%
	F1F1 (silver rose)	339		47.3%
	G1G1			110		15.5%
	L1L1			36		5.0%
	P1P1			63		8.8%
	Q2Q2			1		.1%
	Q4Q4			51		7.1%
	Q5Q5			2		.2%
	U8U8 (Stone Grey)	51		7.1%

	Total Cars US		716

I don't know what most of these color codes mean, but I find Q2Q2 with 1 car 
and Q5Q5 with 2 cars quite intriguing because they are so rare. Does anyone 
know what colors these codes represent?

A previous owner also obtained a Certificate of Authenticity from PCNA for the 
'88 951S and under Optional Equipment the following was listed as assembly 
specifications:

	R36		944 Turbo "S" Option Package
	158		Radio, Reno
	454		Cruise Control
	600		Electric Sunroof
	758		944 Turbo "S"
	946		Partial Leather Front Seats

I was wondering if the R36 Package included the 5 options listed below it? 
Otherwise R36 almost seems the same as 758.

Now a few questions specifically for Lee... when State Farm totaled your car, 
how did things come out on the settlement?  I also had an S totaled by State 
Farm and fought a month long battle to get a reasonable $ from them. Just 
curious as to your experience. Are you actively looking for another S?

Hi all,

In the past I've been annoyed by messages of the "Hey! Anyone out there?"
variety, but now that I've been Digestless for a couple of days, I need to know
if my server is toast. The Computer Coordinator says  "No." Can somebody clue
me in?
Regards,
Gary
