Well, the list of people w/ 924's or 931's is growing as we speak. Please
continue to send me your info for compilation. I'm looking for:

your name
your location (city and state or city and country)
your car(s) (year, model (924/931), transmission (automatics???) )
your car(s) name(s) if applicable ;)
anything special about your car you'd like to show off - not interested in
listing factory options (aside from trim levels or special editions), but
rather aftermarket modifications that you or PO's have done. Weber's,
uprated turbos, suspensions, etc., a general overview.

I'm also investigating making this available on the web for lookup
capability, accessible by password only. Please let me know with your
entry if you'd find this acceptable. 

Eventually I'll be posting a summary of how many 924/931 owners are
out there on the list, with some statistics, so now's your time to stand up
and be counted, even if you don't want to supply all the above personal
information...
