The car's computers and chips are located in the passenger-side footwell
(look under carpet and you'll see a plywood board and other stuff under
there).  And if you do have the Autothority chips (APE), I'd suggest you use
Premium gasoline, or the max octane you can obtain.  That's a big part of
their whole secret formula.  By law, all car manufacturers have to make
their vehicles capable of running on the cheapest, lowest rated cough syrup
when they import them to the U.S.  So while Porsche can recommend using
Premium, they cannot really require it, and the factory computer chips are
designed to accomodate driving with the low-grade stuff in your tank.  APE,
since they're not an OEM car manufacturer anyway, has the freedom to
reprogram their chips with mapping that does take advantage and make full
use of the highest-octane gasoline we can buy here.  This is really the way
our chips should have been designed to be begin with.
