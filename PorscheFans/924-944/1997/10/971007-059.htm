ROTATE CV JOINTS Left TO Right - counter direction! 

Dear P-Fans
	I've experienced the same vibration problem under hard acceleration from the
rear of the car in my 951. I would suspect that the CV-Joints have pitting
inside of them.  I would remove one axle side:  for a closer inspection,
clean them and dissemble. You might try and repack the CV's with new grease.
 If they are pitted you will need to replace the worn CV's.  
	One thing you could also try is to swap the drive shafts "Left to Right" and
"Flip Them" so that the drive shafts spin in the other direction! This will
slove the vibration for a short time! The CV's will devellop a wear pattern
grove where the CV balls ride in. When you rotate the CV-Joints it will take
some time/maileage for new groves to devellop. 
					Good Luck, David Jalali
