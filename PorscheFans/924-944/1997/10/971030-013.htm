I have owned my 944 for over a year now and just recently started calling
it "my baby".  I don't necessarily think of it as she or he, just "my
baby".  Of course I'm female so that may have something to do with it.
What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter if you refer to your car as a he
or a she, your attachment to it still comes out regardless.  For instance
"road buddy" or "fat understeering cow", depending on how it's running.  My
father always referred to his 55 Ford as a she, maybe it's a guy thing.  I
wouldn't be too concerned about not having a specific gender for your car.
To each his own.
