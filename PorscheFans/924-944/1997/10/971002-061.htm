<< Subj:	 2 cents. start switch
=20
 the power to the cold start injecter comes from the starter-through a
 temp sensor for COLD starting.What someone might have done is
 wire a switch in to a power source to compensate for another hot start
 problem. maybe the problem is a bad fuel accumilater
 or weak fuel pump.(spelling?) <grin>

Another attempt at a foolish workaround when a component fails.   If you
have trouble starting warm in a CIS system, you have vapor lock, caused
by a loss of fuel pressure when the engine is turned off.   Replace the f=
uel
accumulator and fuel pump check valve and you will be back on the road.
