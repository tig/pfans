The cold idle is controlled by two things.  The warm up regulator (which =
regulates the fuel) and the auxillary air valve (which regulated the =
air).  You can either replace them both, replace one and hope you =

How do I get on the registry?

I use a wide bottom mug set on the floor.  Never slow down!
