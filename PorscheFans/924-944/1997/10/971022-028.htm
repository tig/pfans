There was a recent post on this topic seeking advice.  I think that the car
has a cylinder problem and was/is sometime driven on the track.  Ata minimum,
I would put in a wide fire ring head gasket.  The best price I've found on
these is from Engine Builder's Supply in Reno.  You also (of course) have to
replace all of the various other gaskets (intake and exhaust manifolds,
etc.).

If you are taking the motor out or going into the bottom end, I'd replace the
rod bearings and modify/have some else modify the oil pan.  I recently did
the rod bearings on my car and it was pretty easy.

I can think of two persons whom might comment on the topic of stroker kits.
 One is Dale Fazekas, who runs a company in Indianapolis called Terbatronics
(I think that is it's name)  Dale has recently offered a stroker kit for sale
(see Pano) that he was going to put into his race car.  He is very
knowledgable and used to race 951's in IMSA.

If you really want a consultant, the number one 944/951 engine builder in
North America is Jon Milledge in Marshfield, Mass.  He is a multiple IMSA
champion in these cars.  Jon built the modified oil pan and air/foam
eliminator device that I have in my car.

Of course, many others can provide advice on engine parts and stroker kits
(e.g., David Raines at Powerhouse, Arnold at Andial), but I'd stick to
Milledge for the ultimate advice.
