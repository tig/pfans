Hi Justin,
I can앖 resist to tell you my history. My situation was exactly the same as
yours, some months ago. I was in the market for a Porsche (with preference
for the 924, because of the price), for daily driving. Once, I go to a
stand of ocasion cars, and see a beautifull 924, model 1984, Alpine White,
imported from Germany. I took it for a ride, and a week late, it was on my
garage. The price was aprox. 10 000 USD (don앖 laught :-) ) with a good
value for my old car. Of course, I know that with this money I could get a
mint 944, but not in Portugal, and I can앖 go to the States to buy a car.
But even in Portugal, you can have a 924 of early 80압 for 8 000 USD, but
I았e prefered to pay a litle more for a very good one. I앐 very happy with
my car, it is very reliable (except the exaust system, that is always
breaking), and not expensive to maintain. The fuel consuption is between
the 8.5 to 10 l/100 Km, in travel. In city I don앖 know, but I can guess
that is no more than 12 - 13 l/100 Km. I don앖 think is too much, but the
fact is that I would like some more power. But, for your information, in
the highway, I can go always at more than 200 Km/h, and I reach 230 Km/h,
near the redline, easily. By the way, I would like to post here the
question to the list about this, because I think that is a very high speed
for a stock (?) 924. Is it possible that my speedometer is not working
properly? I know other stock (?) 924 with that performances.

My advice for you is:
-Unless you are a experienced mechanic, get a mint Porsche.
-If you don앖 mind to have the "poor man Porsche" (the price I았e payed is
not so poor), and sometimes feel that you should have some more power, why
not the 924 NA? It압 unexpensive to maintain, and, as you can see by my
description, it don앖 ashames me in front of some other sport cars. As you
have a lot of Audi parts in it, you can get them easily.

P-fans, sorry for the bandwidth.
