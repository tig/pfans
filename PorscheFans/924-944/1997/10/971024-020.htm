Howdy,

Can you guys in the North West area of the US and our friendly members
in other areas of Canada besides B.C. look around in the local papers or
at the local reputable dealers for a car for me.  We've been searching
high and low for a low mileage, CLEAN, 89 944 Turbo around here for
months and have turned up nothing.  We are now willing to expand that
search to include areas of the NW USA and provinces such as Alberta,
etc.

I'm basically looking for two variations, one a very clean one for
Paul's younger brother to buy, price range of C$21,000 - C$28,000
(US$15,000 - US$20,000) and the other a high mileage car with a decent
history for my future race car, price range C$14,000 - C$16,000
(US$10,000 - US$12,000).  The race car can have an accident on record
as long as it's been fixed well.

Thanks guys!

Farzaan.
