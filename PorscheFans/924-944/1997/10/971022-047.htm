P-fans:

I have read the comments about willingness of the 944S2 to rev compared to
the 951S.  Menelaos asked about the 968.  I have found that both my 968s are
very eager to rev (assuming the balance shafts are aligned right!).  It feels
like I zoom to redline without even trying, very similar to my old 91 MR2
turbo.  There is a noticeable kick at 4500 rpm, which is from the Variocam.
 I suspect that this enhancement is the reason for the easy revving.  I think
that this is just another reason that the 968 is a significantly improved car
compared to earlier models, a point I make only because it seems to get
ignored most of the time by both the list and the public.  It really does
seem to have the best qualities of both the 951 and S2.

I'm only grousing because my local exoticar dealer hurt my vanity by telling
me the other day that a 968 would be worth less than a 951S, all other things
being equal.  Then again, I have never driven a Turbo S...
