They were advertised at $219.  I was initially charged $231.?? and that was 
supposed to be with Fed Ex 3 Day shipping.  I got the books 7 days late and 
then I saw the second charge of 10.35 on my AMX bill.  I called them 
yesterday and they said the extra 10.35 was due to their error in 
estimating the shipping charge.  So I politely told them they were nuts. 
 They are currently "investigating" the shipping issue, now admitting that 
maybe they didn't go out as promised or as I was told on the fifth day 
after I ordered the manuals when I called to check on the status.  I will 
stick to Vertex, Zims, and Stoddard for future stuff unless I get a call 
refunding all shipping charges as Fed Ex will refund them to By Design if 
the manuals were indeed late.
