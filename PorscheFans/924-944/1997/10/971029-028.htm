I wrote a mini article distilled from a Panorama piece back in June.  I 
dug through my pile of diskettes and recovered the post. See below.

Subject: Fog light modification.  Kind of long, but easy.
 
There is an article in the February 1997 issue of Panorama article re: 
Porsche electrical systems, and in particular, how to modify the fog 
lights to operate independently of the headlights.  I decided to tackle
this and I took notes as I went along.  
 
I just walked in from the garage after completing the modification.  Very
easy.  It took less than an hour and I didn't have to take apart the
central electric board!  I will post my little mini procedure below,
distilled from the Panorama article.  Take a look at it if you have a
copy.. however these instructions should be thorough. See the article
should your car not conform to what I have described. 
 
There are many reasons to perform this modification.  In the US (and
possibly other countries as well) the fog lights are disabled when the
headlights are off or on high beam.  First, I want to run the fog lights
as 'daytime running lights' without having the parking lights and the dash
illumination on all the time.  Second, on a deserted highway at night, I
want to run the fog lights with the high beams for added lighting. 
 
Here is the procedure.  I did this on my '89 NA 944.  This should apply 
to most '85/2 and on cars.  Please take the usual precautions - 
disconnect battery negative cable, etc.
 
1.  Unclip and remove the central electric panel cover.
 
2.  Unplug and remove the G6 bridge adaptor (it looks like a really short 
    relay, only about 1/2 inch tall).  The part number stamped on mine is
    944.610.183.06.  The label inside of the central electric panel cover 
    labels it as 'G6 spare links' although the Panorama article refers to 
    it as a 'bridge adaptor.'  Do not confuse it with G19, which is called
    an 'alarm bridge adaptor' according to the label.
 
3.  Open the G6 adapter.  Mine has a plastic cover.  I just spread the
    base enough with my fingernails to allow the bakelite base with the
    contacts sticking out to come free.  If yours has a metal cover or
    otherwise differs from my description, well, use your ingenuity to
    open it. ;-) Be careful when you remove the cover, or all of the
    connectors will fall out, and you will have created a puzzle.  Guess
    who did that :-)  Stick bits of tape on the connector spades to keep 
    them in place, if desired.
  
The insides of the G6 adaptor are very simple.  Just a few links between
spades, and two diodes.  Draw yourself a diagram of the interior so you can
put things back to stock should you get cold feet during the procedure or
want to restore the car to original.  Or you can buy a new G6 adapter.
 
4.  Here is the actual modification.  The spade on the G6 adapter you are 
    interested in is #9.  It is soldered at the junction between the two 
    diodes.  You need to desolder and remove the spade.  Be sure to leave 
    the two diodes connected. Or, if you do not solder, you can just cut 
    or bend off the spade.  If you cut off the spade, put a piece of 
    black electrical tape over the vacated spot to prevent shorts.
 
Briefly, what you are actually doing (should you be wondering) is
disconnecting the relay coil voltage source (from the headlight low beam
power) to the fog light switch, and replacing it with a terminal 15
source, so your foglights operate independently of the lights, and switch
off with the ignition. 
 
5.  Almost done.  Look where G6 used to be plugged in.  You will see each
    slot that accepts the spades are numbered.  Strip a 4 inch piece of wire
    on each end, and insert one end into <slot #9> on the central electric
    board.  This corresponds to the #9 spade you removed from the G6
    module.  You will want to stick a short spade in with the wire so it 
    makes firm contact, but leave the top of the socket as flush as
    possible.  You will be plugging G6 back in over the top of the wire you
    just inserted.  The other end goes under a fuse leg (nearest the
    center of the fuse panel, so the wire is actually fused).  This should
    be terminal 15 or X, so your foglights will shut off with the key.  I
    chose fuse 25, which is heated seats (which does not exist on my car -
    unused circuit).  I would not pick a sensitive circuit, like anything for
    the DME, instruments, radio, etc., just to be on the safe side.  
    However, the draw needed by the coil in the fog light relay is very 
    tiny, just a fraction of an ampere, so don't worry.
 
Please be sure there is no exposed bare wire when you are done, and that 
there are no stray strands that could potentially cause a short!
 
6.  Carefully plug the G6 adapter back into the central electric panel
    (over the wire you inserted into slot 9).  Reconnect the battery 
    negative, and get your keys!
 
Testing:
 
A.  With the key in the RUN position (dash lights on) you should be able 
to flash the fog lights with the high beam stalk (original flash to pass 
function with headlights retracted, parking lights OFF).
 
B.  [New function] The fog lights should turn on with the switch, with 
the headlights and parking lights OFF (daytime running light mode, if 
desired).
 
C.  Fog lights should work with the low (dipped) beams on, like usual.
 
D.  [New function] Fog lights should work with the high beams on.
 
E.  With fog lights ON, they should switch OFF with the key.
 
That's it!  The procedure is really easier than it looks.  E-mail me if 
you note an error, or with any questions should you get stuck.  
 
Disclaimer:  I am not liable for potential damage caused to your car 
if you use this procedure.  The procedure worked for me.
