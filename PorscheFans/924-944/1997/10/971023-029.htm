I have called Turbo & Hi-Tech Performance Magazine regarding re-printing their
1995 article on turbo's.  They are very busy at the time and stated that they
do not usually grant permission to re-type articles to be posted on the
internet.

They do have information available on the net, their web page is
http://www.turbomagazine.com/  (sorry, I do not know how to make this a hotlink
using Lotus Notes)

The issue that I am referring to has information on inducers, exducers,
performance improvements, backpressures, A/R dilemma's, high flow vs. quick
spool, compressors, turbines etc...  This info can be found in their 10th
Anniversary Issue, page 98-102.  These guys also have a great deal of other
information on turbos, suppliers, remanufacturer's etc...

The gentleman that I spoke to told me all kinds of reasons for not having too
much information on the web; the biggest being that you can't make money off a
web site and that it takes money to maintain a web site.  I told him that
people who belong to the Porschefans list are the exact type of people that he
should be targeting for increased circulation and increased profits for his
advertisers.

Check out their web site and leave a message that you heard about them from the
porschefans list.  Maybe this would get his attention.  Hope this is helpful.
Back issues cost $5.00 and that includes shipping
