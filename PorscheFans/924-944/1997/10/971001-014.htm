Well I've finally discovered what ails my half-hearted clutch pedal. I
can honestly tell you it's not air in the hydraulics. I went through a
quart of brake fluid just to be sure. It's also not the master or slave
cylinder. No leaks. 'So what's the problem?' you ask... It's the
firewall. Apparently there is a hole placed in the firewall to locate
the master cylinder. Welded to this hole is an oval bracket with a hole
in its center and two studs for mounting the master cylinder. When
depressing the clutch there is some deflection of the firewall from the
force placed upon it by the clutch  system. Over time the firewall on my
car must have fatiged from the deflection causing the wall to tear. The
area below and to the left (drivers side) of the mounting bracket have
completely torn away. This tearing allowed the cylinder to move toward
the front of the car a good quater inch. Which explains why the
adjustment rod was not helping much. I guess I'll have to break out the
tools and welder...

I'd like to thank everyone from the list for there help. It's nice being
able to look for answers from people that are on the same 'boat.' It
would probably be safe to assume that this problem was unique to my car.
Only because I've never heard of this situation before. If any of you
would like to check your car; there is one tell tale sign to look for.
With the hood up on the car have someone depress the clutch pedal while
you watch the master cylinder. If it moves a little while the clutch is
being depressed, then you may have detected a problem.

Thanks again.
Michael
