I've got 150-410 lb Turbo Cup progressive springs, 968 sports option sway
bars, and 29 mm torsion bars on my S2 and it's still OK on the street and
great for the track.  You might consider progressive heavy-duty springs --
they give an easier ride on the street, but still lock the body roll in
quickly on a turn.  The 29mm torsion bars really stiffen things up. You
don't need that much on a lighter late '85. You might consider 26-27 mm
bars.  The sway bars (I've got 30 front/19 rear) don't affect the road ride
much, so you can max out there.

Just be careful not to beef up the front end w/ heavy springs w/out
compensating in the rear.

?? subject = a few good questions?? "I eat breakfast 300 yds from 4000
Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't think you can come down here,
flash as badge, and make me nervous. Roll the dice and take your chances." 


"Say hi to Castro for me."

"Well don't I feel like the f*****g a**hole.

"If you handle everything in the slick-ass, fast-food, Persian-bazaar
manner with which you've handled everything in this case, then something's
gonna get missed ......"

"And the hits just keep on going."

"The truth! You can't handle the truth!"
