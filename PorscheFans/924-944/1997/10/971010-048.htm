John, by all means I do give credit to Porsche for refining the 911 concept
to a fine edge, although as you stated, it is clearly not the best layout
for a street driven car (by non-professional race driver-type people).  I
guess you can't blame the marketers for pushing the historical roots and
pedigree of the car, particularly when the strong German currency was
making Porsche a harder sell value-wise.  You might say they were able to
turn an engineering anachronism (as of the mid 80's anyway) into a
prestigious, sought after sports car.  Oh well - race on Sunday, sell on
Monday.....
