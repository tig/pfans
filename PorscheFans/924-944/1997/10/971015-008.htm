	I had the same problem, and have had similar situtations on other
cars that I had prior, that the bumper is mounted on springs, and should
return upon compression.  But when some _____ bumped into me, the front
bumper did not return.  But I knew that it sould return, and just figured
that the tube-within-a tube was dirty and stiff.  So I loosened the
mounting bolts, and a little tap on the tube directly and pop, out it
came, as good as new.  Now this is on a 85.5 944 NA, but I am naively
going to assume that the 951 has a similar design.  Although this might be
my downfall..  Just my 0.02
