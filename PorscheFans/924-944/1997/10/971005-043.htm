Subject: replacement catalytic converters
To: 924-944@porschefans.COM

this is just a question and someone with more dealer exp. than i may have
the answer.

it is my understanding that with all new cars the emissions systems are to
be replaced under warranty for the life of the car (idea being these parts
should last the life of the car anyway)  this would include Catalytic
converters (which it is illegal to remove unless being replaced with a new
one; texas law states), all O2 sensors and any other emission related
equipment.  


Dear Matt & P-Fans
	The Federal Goverment mandates that the car manufacture guaranties the
emissions equipment last a certain amount of time, miles & years. On cars
built up to Model Year (MY) 1995, the federal emission warranty is 5/50 -
five years (from the cars in service date, not sold date, say if it was a
demo) or 50K miles, which ever comes first. For 1996 MY - cars and up I think
it is (?) - 7 years or 80K miles. 
	This warranty covers anything that can make a car fail the emission test
(tail pipe or the IM240 - dyno test). They will cover things like spark plug
wires, cap & rotor, spark plugs, catalytic convertor, egr system, ect....
