Here is what I run on my car, which is basically a Turbo S:

Front

Shocks: Koni double adjustable Club Sport units.  Bought at swap meet for $20
(!!!!!!!!!), custom valved by Truechoice.

Perches: Generic perches to accept 2 1/2 inch racing springs.  These are
easier to deal with than the Turbo S perches, because they accept a common
type of racing spring.  $100/pr from Ground Control.

Springs: 325lbs (Winter and AX).  450 lbs Eibach (track).  The latter is a
recent change, and works fine so far.  No need for specially-shaped springs.

Sway Bar: 30 mm 968 M030 which is the same as the so-called Club Sport.
 Bought from Carlsen (dealer) .  Cheaper than Weltmeister, but not
adjustable.  Much, much cheaper from dealer than aftermarket parts houses
claiming that they sell some special racing part.

(Misc.) Kelly Moss Racing camber plates, and Brey Kraus brace.

Alignment: - 2.2 camber, 2.6 caster and 1/16 inch toe out on each side.

Rear

Shocks: Koni sport units for 968 M030.  Allows simple coil-over set-up for
"helper" springs.  Bought at the dealer.

Torsion bars: Turbo S 25.5 mm.

Helper springs: Carrera brand 3 inch free length, 2 1/4 inch diameter, 200
lbs rate.

Sway bar:  Weltmeister.

Alignment: Angstroms, (okay maybe a few mm) of toe in on each side.  -1.5
camber.

This set-up works fine.  I have a spare set of 944 Turbo S front and rear
shocks, front springs, perches, and strut bearings, which I can easily
install if I'm not racing for awhile.
