Since this is a NA 944 you will do fine so long as you do not have a
heavy right foot. Snow tires really help, and I would even go for
studded tires if you plan to drive in Aspen. Understand that you should
not use studded tires on your 944 on dry pavement or even light snow,
for the health of your 944 and the road. I have driven two winters in WA
state through the worst storms in a few decades, and my 944 never missed
a beat. In fact other people--blondes incidentally--kept losing control
of their vehicles and slamming into my 944! Look at your factory manual
for recommended snow tire sizes/profiles. Normally the skinnier the
better, and look for the most aggressive tread pattern you can find.
Remember these are not performance speed-rated tires, don't use them on
your next road-race to New Mexico. Rear snows are adequate for traction,
but all four snows make for acceptable handling also.

Not sure where the "blonde stuff" fits, but get Bosch OEM spec plugs for
your car. As Dave Cooley would say, if factory plugs don't light your
fire your 944 has other problems. Splitfires did nothing for my 944. In
any case increased performance is the last thing I would look for
driving in Aspen this winter -- you have heard about El Nino?!

Not sure what these "2 speed sensors" you refer to are. Your 944 has
only one. The DME relay can cause problems so maybe that is what you
replaced.

> whatta car!!!

I don't know about a 944 called "Baby" (this is a German high
performance automobile you are driving, how about "Wunder Kinder"!) but
agreed, whatta car!

Any number of things you will need to check come summer. Radiator could
be plugged (don't use ordinary coolant, this is an aluminum engine), the
temp gauge could be off (use a pyrometer to check real temp), the hoses
could be bad, thermostat could be rated high or stuck, washer around
thermostat could be missing. Your car is hot-running by nature, and if
you almost overheat in October in Aspen, you will need to fix this
problem before you have to drive with the A/C on through New Mexico next
summer!

Wiring short somewhere, either in the steering column assy. or a zillion
other places! Welcome to the joys of vintage 924 electricals -- good
luck!

Classic symptoms. You are losing fuel pressure and getting vapour lock.
Bad fuel pump check valve, fuel pressure
regulator, fuel pressure dampener, and/or leaky injector(s). You drive a
NA 944 with lower compression than some Saturns and Fords. No need to
use premium fuel unless you notice a difference in performance.
Recommended fuel for your car is 87 octane.

This will be my (and the 944's) first winter in Denver. Let me know what
sort of weather you think we will see.
