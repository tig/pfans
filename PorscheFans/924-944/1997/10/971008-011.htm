WOW, The bucks must be going into Rut. If you guys keep smacking heads at
least put on a lid. Anyway if your life is so mundane that you actually care
if somebody waves back to you maybe, you need some help.

The real reason I write is this: I've gotten bored with the 951. I know I
can do lots of stuff to it, but its not the performance, its the same car
for 2 years. I will probably keep it but am thinking of getting one of those
slow ,ugly, NSX's that matt harrison loves so much. I like the car, and it
looks (IMHO) better then the 911 and lets face it there aren't a whole lot
out there so it's not as common.

O.K. folks what do you think? E-Mail me direct so I don't waste width on the
list. I'll post the pros and cons that I hear later. As for the cost; I've
seen several 91 NSX's with low miles in the low 30's in NY City and Long Island.
