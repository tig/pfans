Hey guys:

Think I may have zeroed in on the power loss problem on my 924S. 
Apparently the battery is dying, because the fans run all the time
regardless of the engine temperature.  So this means that it is probably
a good idea to check the fan circuit, fuse, and relay.

The reason I figured this out, is that when I went to start the other
car tonight I heard a soft whirring coming from the Porsche.   I
thought, what the heck is that?  Upon investigation, sure enough the
fans where whirring away and the car hadn't been driven for at least
five hours and had to be cold.  I also noticed that right after I jumped
started her this morning the fans came on while she was still cold, but
I didn't make the mental connection then.  Knew something was amiss
right off though this time.  The fans are killing the battery!

So what do you think?  Bad relay switch or something else related to the
fans that could be making this happen.  What should I do now, replace
the relay?  Suggestions for how to proceed from here appreciated.  TIA!
