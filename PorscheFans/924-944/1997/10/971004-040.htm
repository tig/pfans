Well while we are on the subject,

My family has a small VW shop and I've always ordered new parts through
our wholesalers.
( In fact what would you think about an online Porsche parts site. All internet 
based, online catalogs, sales, customer service, etc.  Might not be good
for everyone but the guy who knows what he wants might get some 
great prices.)

I digress...

Used parts have been another story.

I needed a head for my 931 when I bought it.

Poor Boys in California had one for about $500. Cash COD!
Great! ship it!  when it arrived I noticed it had been milled at some time.  
The combustion chamber on the 931 is almost entirely in the piston and 
the mill job had just barely exposed the first thread or the spark plug. 
Further investigation revealed that it was over milled by almost a full mm.  
When asked about it the response was "it was running on the car I 
removed it from it must be ok" when I tried to return it, it was returned 
to sender (ME!) Ate that one!

Parts Werks of Chicago had a complete head (with cam) for about $900
(Mastercard this time, I am trainable)
They had to remove it from the car and after about a week my $900+ head 
and cam arrived.  Seems they shipped a NA head instead of a turbo head. 
Called them back and they were happy to send out the correct unit (sorry.)  
Well after the third week and numerous calls with no head.  I was sure they
never had the head in hand and were delaying while they found one.

Now I'm POed.  It's been a month waiting for a head to get my car back 
together.

NPR has head without cam for $400.
Ordered it and three days later...

 two heavy boxes via UPS.
One from Parts Werks one from NPR. 
 As I needed the cam I took them both.

The one from Parts Werks looked like it had seen service as an anchor. 
Had worn guides etc. and the seats were worn to the limits.  (cutting 
them further would have sub leveled the valves)

The one from NPR...
very nice. clean unmilled, good guides, valves, etc.


As a result of this whole experience I will only deal with Mastercard 
so I can stop payment. And I'll never do business with Poor Boys 
and Part Werks again! Deal with them if you like but you've been warned!

On a more positive note... 
NPR was great!  
Active Auto in Memphis has been great! (a/c evap for the 951)
(and I have a spare rebuilt 931 head (But I paid for it!))

BTW
I was really sick when 10 months later I ran across a 931 whole 
for $100 not running, but with a good head.  I held off knowing 
where it was I could get it later. and three years later I've 
needed nothing from it!  Drove by the other day and it and the 
owner were no longer at the house.
