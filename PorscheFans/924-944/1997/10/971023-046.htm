Water leaks & wind noise - finding those leaks!

Friends,
	Everytime it rains, my 968 top - leaks water onto my lap. The water seems to
be leaking from where the roof meets the windshield. My mechanic says I need
to replace the entire gasket, $$$ but I'm not convinced. Any sugestions? 


Thanks very much for your help.

Regards,
Saleem


Dear Saleem & P-Fans

	First your water leak. 3M makes  a product called "Leak Detection Powder"
part#051135-08951 or 3M.I.D.#60-9800-1749-9,  it is a spray spowder for
checking leaks. Spray down the top of the roof area where it meets the
top/roof. Spray down only one side, then close the roof and re-open the roof.
 Inspect the roof gasket for the white tail-tail mark of the powder.  If the
white contact trace point has a gap or gets faint, that is the area the
gasket is not sealing in.
	 You can also use a dollar bill, put in between the suspected area, close
the roof, and slide the dollar bill in a "sawing" motion. If "sawing" motion
of the dollar bill becomes easier to move back and fourth, that area is not
sealing properly! 
	 Fixing the leaking gasket. In some cases you might need to replace the
gasket itself. First try some simple repairs. The top gaskets and seals,
usualy are hollow. You can try to reinforce the inner part  (the hollow part)
with a rubber vacum hose (small 2-3 mm vacum hose works well) or the hard
type plastic vacum tubing used under the hood, sold at most dealer by the
meter. In some cases -  the top latch mechanism there is some adjustments,
and for the side windows the glass window height can also be adjusted up or
down, there is a hole in the bottom of the door, usualy a "Torx Socket",
T-27, looks like a reverse of a "Torx" bit.   Hope this helps you out.

	

					Good Luck, DJ
