In response to some questions regarding cupholders, I may be able to help.

I have the perfect solution in my car.  I removed the cassette inserts so that
my cassette holder was one empty tray.  I found a cupholder at a convention
that was a promotional item that is very nice.  It is flat enough to fit inside
the cassette holder and opens by pushing a button to rasie the cupholder to
hold your beverage.  The whole assembly is a scissors mechanism.  (I know this
is an awful description)  You can actually place two of these holders in the
cassette area.

There are potentially a couple of drawbacks.  To mount the cupholder properly
(it comes with double sided tape that really doesn't work great), you have to
remove the cassette holder which is very simple, drill one hole in the bottom
so that you can screw the cupholder in place.  I would also recommend using a
little adhesive for further stability.

You also need to have the cassette holder open to use the cupholder.  This
means that you will need to have the seat far enough forward so that the cover
doesn't flap over 180 degrees.  (this isn't very much but the seat cannot be
all the way back)  The last point is that this particular cupholder does not
hold the "Big Gulp" type cups.

I looked for a very very long time to find a cupholder that was acceptable and
this one really works nice.  I am just pointing out the pitfalls so that you
all have the facts.  These pitfalls are not a big deal however.

I have those cupholders that are aftermarket items for Mecedes in my wife's car
and they keep breaking (they are replaced for free but it is a pain to keep
having to go the dealer).

If anyone is interested in this cupholder, I can maybe find out who makes it.
