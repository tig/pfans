Yes it seems to me those people would probably be happier in 928's since
they can have the automatic and the extra power needed to go along with it.
 To me, looking for a car with an automatic 'automatically' puts one more
into the personal luxury car market segment.  There are certainly many
other cars that do this type of thing better than a 944.
