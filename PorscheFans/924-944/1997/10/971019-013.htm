Hey fans!

        The blonde is back! "Bringing Up Baby" has been most
challenging.  I'm
happy to say Baby is up and running great, finally.  The overheat was a
bad fan motor (replaced thermostat and thermofan switch too), and the
hard start problem turned out to be the speed sensor which I have since
found out there are two of in the '83 944 (replaced the DME switch,
ignition switch, ground straps too,).  Baby & me drove like mad to New
Mexico last weekend (first road trip since I bought it in August, didn't
trust the overheat problem for a long trip in summer).  From Aspen to
Albuquerque (over Indepdence Pass) made it in 6 hours 30 minutes! I ummm
put Baby to the ultimate test and I'm happy to say I'm in love... 
whatta car!!!

Just a few annoying little things still to fix:

1.      Temperature gauge still shows overheat, it's looks to be about a
quarter or 1 bar off.  The fans work and come on when the line is at the
edge of the red zone instead of at 3/4's or 3 bar as it should do under
normal operation, and it is not overheating.  Should I replace the gauge
or is there a sending unit I should test first, and where exactly would
the SU be?  (Side bar, the fuel gauge never registers FULL after a
fill-up either).

2.      Here's a strange one, when the turn signal switch is activated,
left
or right turn doesn't matter, the Fasten Seat Belt alarm and light come
on for about 5 seconds and then go off until the next signal
activation.  What is up with that?

3.      Turns over just like that (one turn of the key) when cold but
takes
two, sometimes three when warm (ambient or engine).  Have used two tank
loads of techron, use premium fuel and still have the multiple keying
problem.

Any help you can offer is always appreciated.  I'm blonde, you
understand.

P.S.  In my case, I'm the "wife" who owns the Porsche, a blonde driving
a German car! It's my husband who is extremely supportive emotionally
(and sometimes financially) of my habit... (He likes to pretend it's his
car [we're separated since May but still the best of friends,
thankfully] this should come as no surprize, no surprize 'tall). We
would both prefer to work on Baby ourselves than to have someone else do
it.  However, Lynn Hough at Mid Valley Imports in Basalt has proven
himself to be most trustworthy with Baby.  Thanks Lynn!
