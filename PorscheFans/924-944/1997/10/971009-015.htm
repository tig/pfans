There is this nasty noise that was coming from the Compressor so I tried
not to drive it.  One day in desperate need of transportation I took the
car out only for the compressor to Seize on the trip... Really Dumb on my
part.  So I Garaged it again and I have searched all over.  My compressor
is not a rebuild possibility and not even a candidate for getting a core
charge back.

the car would run, but the Ac would not work... Or $860 for a rebuild unit
and installation.  Back to the garage.  Talked to allot of people selling
used and rebuild units.  I should be getting the part in the next few days
and will get it in the car this weekend.  If all works well I will tell you
where I got it.  I paid $180 for this one... Big gamble, but lets see what
happens.  Tell you about it Next Week.

When mine went out, my mechanic advised that the compressor on the 944's
was not a very good unit, was very expensive and he suggested replacing it
with a Sandan. It was cheaper for me to buy a new Sandan unit and have it
installed than a rebuilt Porsche compressor would have been. It has been in
for about 3 years with no problems at all.
