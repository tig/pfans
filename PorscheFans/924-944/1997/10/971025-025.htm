All,

OK, this is for you guys who are familiar with fuel mapping and how the
vacuum system effects the ignitions system, etc.  If I modify the air flow
meter to turbocharger boot so that the air flow meter is about 3 or 4 inches
from the turbocharger, what potential effects could it have on the operation
of the engine management system (or anything else, for that matter)??
 Realize that the vacume lines connecting to the boot will be moved closer
together.  It shouldn't have any effect on the air bypass valve.  One of them
is the PCV valve if I'm not mistaken, so that shouldn't be a problem.  The
two small ones, I'm uncertain of, but the won't be moved to far from thier
original positions, however, the vacuum pressure seen by these lines may be
different due to potential changes in the flow patterns around them.

I realize this will be wasted bandwidth to most of you, but I plan on trying
this when I get back to the states in a couple of months, and it could prove
to be a cheap mod which will allow the use of a cone filter, allow the system
to use cold air from outside the engine compartment, allow striaght
intercooler pipes to be used, and clear up the front of the engine
compartment.  This will result in a great reduction in intake head loss (not
as much as a MFS, but for a $100 or so instead of $2000).
