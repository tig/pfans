I'm new to the group, having just received delivery of my sister's 87 924s,
which she gave me for the cost of transport from the bay area to seattle,
since the cost of replacing the shattered automatic flex coupling was beyond
what she was willing to pay. I have been lurking and looking on the net for
all the info I can find, and have been delighted with the wealth of it. The
car has 93k on the clock, and the belts were done at 60k. I have already
decided to do the rear main seal, belts, water pump, and front seals while
I'm at it in order to make this  a reliable car. I have been hearing about
rusty hinges on the hatch possibly contributing to glass separation from the
frame. I took a look to see if it looked like some wd40 might be in order and
discoverd that one of the hinge PINS was almost completely out, and the other
was about halfway out. I'm sure that when one of these finally gets out, the
twisting strain caused by the force of the struts could help bring on a
big-hassle repair. I plan to lube these pins up except for the knurled end
which is supposed to hold the thing in place, which will be getting some
locktite. I suggest y'all get out there and check those things, since they
are easy to overlook tucked behing the seals as they are. Sorry to take up so
much space on such a menial item, but it could save a weekend of work better
spent on more important maintenance.
