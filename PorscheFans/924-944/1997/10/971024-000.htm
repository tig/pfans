I have to agree that the page is ridiculous, but our beloved cars do/did
have several built in design flaws, as witnessed by the FAQ (which doesn't
include the 16v chain tensioner nightmare).  Of course other vehicle
manufacturers have their share of design flaws, but some of Porsche's
cause severe engine damage (oil cooler seals, water pump, timing belt
breakage, chain tensioner failure on 16v cars). 

The annoying thing about Porsche is it took years for them to correct 
these flaws, instead of researching warranty claims and correcting next 
years production.  Example.. the oil cooler seal failure was not 
corrected from 1983 to 1990, if I'm not mistaken.  The collapsing 911 
tensioner disease was not corrected for over a decade.

PCNA could further the Porsche cause and increase sales and customer
loyalty by taking responsibility on some 'out of warranty' warranty claims
on these known, repetitive failures instead of ignoring the customer. 
Granted, maintenance, neglect and mileage should be taken into account.  A
simple admission of, "yea, the rubber clutch center is a common failure on
these cars.  We will pay for the part, how about if you pay the labor,
since it is out of warranty" would go a long way towards mitigating
customer unhappiness and possibly sway the customer to buy another Porsche
in the future. 

I suspect many of the whiners on the caleb page neglected their cars, 
abused them, or treated them like American or Asian cars, expecting to 
replace $30 water pumps and $100 clutches.

I also purchased my 944 expecting it to be a fussy, unreliable sports 
car.  Pre-purchase inspection and a study of the FAQ made me aware of the 
potential pitfalls before purchasing, so I knew I could potentially be 
affected by any of these problems, and take the lumps if they came.

The car has been entirely reliable, as reliable as any of the popular
family cars that sell in mass quantity.  The only snafu have been a
defective rebuilt water pump, the labor of which I was forced to absorb. 
That was my error in judgement.  Talk to some of the track/autox folks.. 
those cars have been amazingly reliable serving what I would consider 
stressful or severe service.  Regular attention and maintenance goes a 
long way in keeping these cars alive. People with a Toyota Camry 
mentality were never meant to own these cars.
