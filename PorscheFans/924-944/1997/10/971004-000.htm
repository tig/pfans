I just had the car in to have the new belts retensioned at the requested
1000 mile interval.  Apparently, the latest updates from PCNA state the
'used' specification is 2.0 +/-.3 (microfiche workshop manual says 2.7
+/-.3).  Since that horrible whine from the balance belt is still there, I
asked him to tension to the slack end of the range. The mechanic set it to
1.8.  However, the whine is still present. 

So, are larger numbers on the gauge tighter, or looser?  Kevin Gross' FAQ 
states higher numbers are looser, contrary to what my mechanic says.

I am tempted, at the risk of being sentenced to Porsche hell, to remove 
the cover and slacken the balance shaft belt a bit more to see if the 
whine goes away.  When I brought the car in for the water pump change, 
the balance belt was very loose, but quiet.  After being tensioned with 
the gauge, it was dramatically tighter (by observation and feel).

Comments, public or private, would be appreciated on this subject.  I 
want the belt whine _gone_ as it was before the water pump change.. there 
is no arguing with the holy tension gauge, so I have no grounds to argue 
with my shop, although I made my displeasure about the whine very clear.

Again, comments welcome.  Thanks!

 -Gregor  944 2.7.
