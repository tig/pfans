Finally got my new MetalMaster pads in (thanks Jason!). I recall that there
was a discussion about slotting these pads in for gas venting; definitely
necessary, but is there a concensus as to how deep the slot should be?
I'm guessing about 2/3rds of the way through? I know the width should
be about 2 hacksaw blades...

Thanks to the list for all the discussion about idle screws (924) falling out
- I found out last night mine was very close to falling out, and the engine
made sucking sounds like a Hoover! Runs much better now, and my
brake boost is back from the grave.

How is the cold idle bumped up in the 924? I don't seem to have any such
functioning, and although it starts right up, it'll idle at around 250-300 rpm
until I start driving! My normal (warm) idle is currently about 800 rpm.

The 924 registry is currently numbers around 20 924's (including 2
Martini Edition 924's), 7 931's, and there are a few entries to add yet...

Time for a reader's poll, if you're still reading by this point:
  My coffee is climbing up the side of my cup and out the little hole on my  
travel mug on my way top work in the AM. Should I:
    A) Design and install a gyroscopically-stabilized cupholder?
    B) Slow down?
    C) Use more water and less coffee when brewing? ;)
