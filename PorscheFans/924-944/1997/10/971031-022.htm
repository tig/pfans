Folks,

The gender thing is very tough with the 944.
If you've ever looked at the thing from a couple
of stories up, it's definitely a "she" - the door
and rear fender lines are definitely waist and hips.  On
the other hand, the car is not petite, and the rather
heavy-handed Germanic interior appointments might
preclude a feminine endearment.

My own 944 S2 has been referred to largely in
gender-neutral terms, though a big-haired girl friend
remarked that "she looks like she's in bondage" when
first fitted with a bra (perhaps the use of the bra renders
it female?).

This fall I started calling it "sweetie" --  for
example in tight auto-x turns with the understeer
threatening I found myself coaxing "c'mon sweetie,
stick ..."

I'm sure that this winter, as various upkeep projects begin
stripping the skin off my knuckles, other names will emerge.
