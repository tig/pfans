Just a note about Turbo Magazine and Mike Ferrera in particular.  While
Turbo Magazine does do a good job on explaining its products that it 
features and does a reasonable job of explaining their feature cars, you
should NEVER use them as your only source for factual information.  A
number of their featured cars have been friends of mine and in most cases,
the information is false.  In some cases, the car owner provides false 
information because he doesn't want everyone to be as fast as him and in
other cases, Mike doesn't do his homework and ask for proof of the
capabilities.

Mike has been building his Talon project for a while now and has barely got
the car into the 11's.  Buschur Racing can take a car off the street and in
one weekend, put it deep into the low 11's.  Yet, Mike seems oblivious to
Buschur's help and refuses to accept it.  As far as I'm concerned, that's
an Editor putting his Ego ahead of his readers!

But, not to sound all bad, the magazine has been improving, although Mike's
last editorial was a bit ridiculous.  Personally, I'm letting my
subscription run out and am instead subscribing to Racecar Engineering
and this other European magazine about race car technology.  Both feature
adequate turbo technology (like the recent article on the Lancer's anti-lag
system) and also feature great information on high tech suspension tuning.
