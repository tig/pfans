I just wanted to pass this along in case anybody has a similar problem.

My right low beam in my '88 924S stopped working.  It would come on when the
lights first came up, but would go out after they came up fully.  After
switching lamps, and checking the fuses, I discovered it was a problem with
the right side wiring - not the bulb.  So I shut off the engine with the
lights up and then moved the key to the position where they would work, and
found a short in the wiring because it would come on whenever I pulled it a
certain way.  I traced the wiring as far as I could with the lights on and
found the short was down where the wires disappear into the body structure,
never again to be seen by human eyes.  I felt it the best I could, stood on
my head, practiced more contortions, and finally felt reasonably sure that it
joined into another harness behind the air dam, going over to the left side
of the car.  I cut into it, and sure enough, there was a yellow wire there
that looked like the one I was looking for (consult the Haines manual - the
colors for the wiring diagrams really work!).  I cut into it and ran a wire
from it up behind the light and attached it, and it actually works now!  A
miracle.

Two things are of note here.
1.  This is a multi-strand wire, but they still break because of the tight
turns built into the route they take to the fuse box.
2.  When replacing the trim pieces on the headlight assembly, make absolutely
sure that the black plastic parts fit together perfectly before you try to
close the lights.  They are a little touchy, and if they are not perfect, the
lights will not close because there is less than 1/4" of clearance when it is
all assembled perfectly.
