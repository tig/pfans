That's the first time I've heard that.  The "S" models have always been
documented as having more turbo lag than the normal models.  Driving a 
normal 944 Turbo after the "S" is a bit bizarre, you can hear the boost
build almost off idle.

It doesn't really drag it's butt, but if you look at the dyno charts
http://www.buschurracing.com/dyno you will see that it does lag to the
normal turbo until 3500rpm, then it rockets past the normal turbo.  Even
when you compare APE chips from the 87 to the 89, it is the same story,
lag behind until 3500rpm, then rocket past.  I feel that an 87 Turbo with
LSD would be easier to drive in an auto-x than my 89 because of the less
lag.  I would, however, not give up my "S"'s top end power to be a few
tenths faster at an auto-x :)

If you compare the APE 87 to APE 89 torque charts, you will see that 
the 87's "fun range" is from 2700-5000rpm where it's torque is above
200ft-lbs.  For the APE 89, that fun range is bumped up to 3250-6250rpm
where it's torque is above 200ft-lbs.  Now, if you want to compare
apples to oranges, the same 89 with Cup Car Andial computers stays over
200ft-lbs from 3000-6250rpm making the "fun range" even larger.  The
downfall of that larger fun range is an abrupt increase of torque rather
then the more controllable, smoother rise of the APE units.

The biggest difference comes from the factory use of higher boost on the
"8" exhaust housing turbo cars (the "S" models) and of course the fact
that the housing is bigger, which reduces back pressure.  Fuel is also
increased.  I don't know if they played with the timing on the factory "S"
model's computers.  In the above examples, we are talking about cars with
chips, in one example, both have APE chips, in the other one has Cup Car
computers, and in all above examples, this is real wheel torque.

>This is not intended as a flame, I am just very curious.

No flame taken, I like talking about this stuff.

If you want to see the difference chips makes, take a look at the charts
under my name on the web site.  Those were all made with the same
configuration, just different chips.  You can actually move the entire torque
curves up and down with fuel delivery alone and you can introduce dips,
rises, etc, etc.  On our Talon we could tune the fuel to any RPM, so we
could make the car slower than a dump truck to 4000rpm and then set the
fuel to come on full charge which would then provide the turbocharger
with much needed exhaust pressure and heat which would then allow the turbo
to compress air.  The exponential increase in power was stunning, but it
doesn't make for a driveable car, so we fattened the mixture in the 2000-
4000rpm range and had a very driveable car, much like what APE does with
fuel and timing.
