Not yet inducted into the tribal elder portion of the list, but here goes.
No tricks except being ultra careful not to lift the hood too far and
putting stress on the windshield with the pointy ends of the hood.   Have a
suitable piece of wood etc. handy to keep the hood up while you are doing
the work.   Also imperative to have an assistant to carefully lift the hood
the last 1/4 inch to get the shock on. (while you watch that the pointy end
of the hood does not hit the windshield- very important)
The socket end snaps off if you pry the metal latch slightly with a small
screwdriver.   I did mine securing the socket end first, then the other
end.  I suspect that it may be easier to do it the other way since it's a
lot easier to snap the socket onto the ball.  If you have an assistant you
can also (with superhuman effort) just barely compress the hood shock and
snap it in position.
