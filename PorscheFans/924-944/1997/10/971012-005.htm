Firstly what is your idea of 'reasonably inexpensive'?
Secondly how long do you want your engine to last?
Thirdly are you living somewhere where the green police will hunt you
down and burn your house to the ground if you mod your engine?
If all of those questions can be answered satisfactorily then.
Get some extractors made by someone who knows what they are doing.
Get the head ported and polished, skimmed too if you can get good gas.
Fit a lumpy cam to make use of that aerated head.
Now either fit a pair of big Weber carbs or have a set of throttle
bodies with injectors made. Important point, tuned intake runners make
the world of difference.
This might be more expensive than, oh dear, supercharging though. I
believe that a list member has had one at one time.
Fit a real oil cooler and change your oil at more frequent intervals.
If everything is done properly expect 80-90 hp/liter.
If any or all of this sounds like a foreign language then you should
consider this.
The cheapest way to go faster is to buy a faster car.

Have fun.
Richard.

What's the story here?  Is there any reasonably inexpensive way to get
more
power out of a garden variety 944 (Non-S and Non-Turbo)?  I've been
looking
around for easy upgrades and haven't found any.  The only thing that
seems to
be available is a new chip, but that is only 10-15 HP.  Surely the plain
944
is capable of 200+ HP!  Any thoughts?
