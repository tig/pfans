Well, I just had to see what the poop was all about and quite frankly, if 
I were in the same position as this fellow, I might be equally enraged.  
For that matter I have seen some pretty angry PorscheFans here from time 
to time.

However, let's not loose perspective here.  We have only one side of the 
story, and that was from a disgruntled owner.  It is a bit difficult to 
defend any position without good facts and a unbiased mind.  If I were 
wearing his wallet, and had to draw that kind of money out of it, I would 
be biased myself.

Still, we have become a society bent on shedding responsibility.  Lawyers 
are busier than ever resolving conflicts of fault.  We expect society to 
protect us from ourselves and to provide compensation when we don't.

Let's take an true example.  A certain farmer, I'll call him Delaney, 
buys a ladder.  Delaney decides to do a little roof work on his family 
barn and comes to the conclusion that he can better reach the roof if he 
places the bottom of the ladder on this pile of manure he has been 
collecting on one side of the barn.  While ascending the the ladder, 
certain elements of mechanical physics come into play diverting Delaney 
from his intended goal of reaching the roof.  At some time during his 
rapid descent, Delaney realizes that a gross error in judgment has been 
rendered. 

In Delaney's mind the fault lies clearly with the ladder.  Delaney's 
bruised body and ego were delighted to find out that a particular legal 
firm, called Delaney and Delaney, also feels the same way.  Delaney's 
legal arm immediately contacts the Delaney Ladder company (who else?) and 
explains in great detail to the president of the company that their firm 
will take legal action against the ladder company for damages incurred by 
farmer Delaney.  The president of the ladder company also enlists a legal 
firm who believes that farmer Delaney's case will stand up no better in 
court than their ladder did on a pile of hot manure.

The court date arrives, and to avoid a big stink, I'll just tell you that 
the judge decided against the manufacture of the ladder, citing that the 
ladder should contain a warning label advising users NOT to set the base 
of ladders on piles of manure.  The judge's final words trailed off with, 
"We hold these truths to be self evident..."

To this day, the Delaney Ladder company now sports a manure warning label 
with every ladder they sell.  The Delaney ladder company is also a good 
bit poorer, and one local farmer and his hired legal firm are a good bit 
richer thanks to our judicial system.

Meanwhile, on the other side of our great country, a high roller 
executive, who also goes by the name of Delaney, is finishing a three 
martini power lunch.  After fumbling with his credit card he then fumbles 
with his keys to his 911 Turbo.  Delaney fails to realize the unique mix 
of physics that exist between martinis and 911 Turbos.  A short time 
later, Delaney's Turbo fails to realize a turn in the road and steers 
Delaney for a turn for the worse.  Delaney's lawyer argues that Delaney's 
911 Turbo left the road tail first.  Obviously this was Delaney's first 
encounter with the laws Porschean physics, however, this was not 
Delaney's attorney's first encounter with the legal system and soon after 
Porsche was found liable for a "flaw" in the design in their cars. 

It seems that the law regards any vehicle that leaves the road "nose" 
first, is the fault of the driver.  However, any vehicle leaving in the 
other direction, is a manufacture flaw.  Since Porsche was negligent in 
providing a warning label about martinis, 911 Turbos, and Porschean 
physics in bold red letters on the sun visor of their car, Porsche paid 
Delaney's lunch ticket.  Delaney went on to be an excellent example 
proving that while a 911 Turbo has its limits, stupidity knows no such 
bounds.

The question that comes to mind with stories like these is, have we lost 
are proverbial marbles?  It seems that our diets must contain some food 
additives that, over the scores of years, have eroded our common sense, 
which in the eyes of the animal kingdom was not very well stocked from 
the start.

We refuse to take responsibilities for our actions.  Farmer Delaney saw 
no reason why he had to take the mechanical properties of manure into 
account when he planted his ladder and good fortune into black gold that 
warm day.  Executive Delaney found nothing incompatible with martinis and 
911 Turbos until he took a turn for the worse and swapped ends.  

These stories are excellent examples of poop happening.  I may be going 
well out on an artificial limb here, but after nine years of driving 944s 
around the country in all sorts of weather, I have yet to encounter the 
problem that our beloved 1983 944 owner, I'll call him Mr. Delaney, has 
had.  Teetering further on this artificial limb, I might find myself 
saying that the alleged design flaw outlined by Mr. Delaney was really 
not a flaw with the car at all.

Curious about this "design flaw", I inspected both of my own cars and 
found the air intake pipe safely tucked behind a wall of plastic which 
surrounds the inner wheel well.  I will creep still further on this 
artificial limb and say that either Mr. Delaney was traveling in perhaps 
a bit more water than he claimed (say 1 to 2 feet), or that a material 
flaw (ie., a big gaping hole in that plastic inner fender well) allowed a 
judicious amount of road juices to enter the air intake.

Either scenario points to the responsibility of the owner to, first drive 
your car in a safe manor, exercise prudence in where and what you drive 
into, and maintain the integrity of your vehicle.  If Mr. Delaney expects 
Porsche to pay for this, Delaney is probably a bit wet behind the ears 
too.

This does not say that there is not a remote possibility that by some 
freak accident a copious amount of water was inadvertently splashed into 
that intake and the engine just lapped it up like a blood thirsty puppy.  
Remember, poop happens, and if you dare to plant a flag in it, you just 
might end up wallowing in it.  Not everyone is as fortunate as Farmer 
Delaney, and sometimes you just have to take your lumps.

Porsche, or any other company for that matter, has no signed pact with 
the public at large that they can protect the would be owner from their 
own stupidity or lack of vehicle maintenance.  We all have to do our 
part, and if we slip up, we must be willing to accept the responsibility.

We own Porsches because we want to.  On occasion, things go bad, just 
like a marriage.  If we run away crying sour grapes each time we get our 
nose bloodied, then we have no business putting it inside the cockpit.

Now I am getting off this limb before I slip into a pile of artificial 
manure.
