	  I want to thank everyone very much for your responses, especially Terry
and George.

I need some more advice, however.  I have done the following.  I have good
ground (#3 position on switch) on both left and right door switches for
right power window.  No other switch connection positions are grounded, and
never blew fuse, so I don't think a short is the cause.

I have power to the #5 (up) switch  position and #4 (down) switch position
on the left door switch to the right window (but left door switch does not
operate window in either direction).

I have power to the #4 (down) position of the right switch (window works in
down direction from right switch) but have no power to the #5 (up) position
in the right switch.

Where does power to the #5 (up) position of the right door switch come
from?  The left switch?  I want to track the wires continuity to find the
break.

When I used a jumper cable to put power from the #5 (up) left switch
position to the #5 right switch position, and pushed the right switch up,
the right window went up.  So the problem is not the right motor or wiring
from the switch to the motor.

Since I have both power and ground at the left switch for the right window,
why doesn't the left switch work the window in either direction?

Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!
