In answer to the question about the turbo S turbo and what is the difference,
all 951's come with K 26 turbo's, the 217hp cars have a number 6 hot housing,
the 247hp cars have a Number 8 hot housing. You cannot tell the difference
visually unless you have the turbo in your hand. Only then are you able to
read the small 6 or 8 cast into the exhaust housing.

The boost mapping on the 247hp cars (and all chipped 217hp cars) make about
10 more hp with the larger number 8 hot housing. the rest of the difference
is strictly the boost, timing and fuel mapping. Its really a backpressure
issue.

Stripping 2nd gear off of the mainshaft on early cars is quite common. Clutch
dumping autoXer's beware!!  All late turbo's and S2's have a hardened
mainshaft.  The turbo S cars have the late shaft that is further strenghtened
by shot peening.

The early era Al Holbert 951 racers  were prone to suspension failures...not
just control arm/ball joint failure, but actual spindle breakage between the
bearings, and common inner C/V joint failure. That's not even counting the
engine problems (mostly oiling). If anyone wants the whole damage list email
me. Most of these areas were addressed in the 87-88 cars. If you doubt
this....check front wheel bearing part numbers and sizes.

We take the air bags off (Legal in PCA as long as you make weight) and junk
the primitive ABS (anyone out there need some ABS parts?) . What you are left
with is a superior track car with better suspension bushings and a stiffer
chassis, better oiling, marginally stronger transaxle and a better wheel
offset which allows us to run VERY WIDE tires under the stock turbo S body
work.

As with most German cars and Porsches in particular, newer is better. Don't
let a few pounds prevent you from getting the newest 951 you can find. With
the exception   of the '89 944 turbo connecting rods, newer is ALWAYS better.
The improvements made on these cars since inception is significant.  


968 Turbo ?  Are we talking about the Powerhaus in Arizona?  While they have
done many 951 2.8's, they have never done a 3.0 16 valve turbo.  The factory
968 turbo IS a 3.0 turbo, and still uses a 8 valve head.  This is the car the
would have secured a future for the 968 as is it flat out AWSOME! Too bad the
bean counters won that battle.

Nice mail list,
