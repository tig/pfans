Hello Gregor

I don't agree with this. I had a rebuilt pump installed in my car, it
it's been fine so far. I've heard stories of NEW pumps failing within
a year too. Sometimes you just get a bad one.

FYI, NO parts place will pay your labor to replace a defective part.
Not Tweeks, not your local dealer, not IMPARTS, not any place I've
ever heard of. Sometimes, the belt is installed too tight, and that
destroys the bearings in the pump. So, while the pump does go bad
while still under warrentee, it was really your (or the shop) fault
that it didn't last.
