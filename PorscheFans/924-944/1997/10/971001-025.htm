Hi all,

Thank you very much everybody answering my question about the differences
of Turbo and Turbo S. Now I have the following question again!

1. My friend told the Turbo S is a kind of ZERO suspension. Is that right?
If I want to lowering the car, will it be very hard to do so?

2. I got a very good condition Sliver Rose 944 turbo for sale at $29000
Canadian with 30000 miles.
and another Sliver Rose 944 turbo for sale at $18000 Canadian with 62500
miles (100000 km) the condition is so so..... 
and one more red in color 89 turbo S for sale at $29000 Canadian with 43750
miles (60000 km) the condition is very good also
which one should I buy? (HARD QUESTION)

3. Is Turbo S a trouble car? if so how trouble? How much I should prepare
if I want to put money for modification anyway?

By the way I would like to say thank you to the Porsche Fans who answered
my question and sent e-mail to me before. 

Yours Truly,

Barry Tam ( Toronto, Canada )
91 MR2 Turbo <----- good car? well if so,I would not concerning to buy a
944 Turbo S
88/89 944 Turbo S ( in the future )
.
