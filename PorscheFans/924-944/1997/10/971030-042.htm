Hello everyone,

       Well, after much hard work and way too much money, I have come to the
conclusion I cannot keep my 944s. For those of you have read and replied to
my past posts, Thank you. But I think the end is here!! 
       I have put every last penny I have into a car my P-mechanic said was
worth putting the money into, and now I find myself with another major
problem and I have no money left to spend!!
      Yesterday on the way home, I was stopping at a light, and I blew right
through it !
I aplied the same pressure I always would to the brake, it went down app. 1
inch, and had very, very little stopping power. I had the pads replaced about
1500 miles ago, so they are practically new. There was also a new noise
coming from under the hood that sounded like a pressure hose had broken.
After a few minutes, I found that the two way plug that goes into the power
brake booster had broken, and that the smaller of the two vacuum hoses had
come off. I went to the dealership this morning, replaced the part, and no
change. The dealer says it is most likely the booster. The part is $375 and
labor is $200. Is there any chance it is something more simple, they also
told me at the dealer that they very, very, rarely have replaced this part.
That it almost always lasts indefinately. But that the vacuum leak could have
damaged it.
      I was thinking maybe (or praying) that it was simply air in the lines,
and that if the system was bled, the brakes would work again. Does this sound
possible ? Or could it be the master cylinder? The symptoms are: Peddle only
depresses app. 1-2 in. It actually feels alot like my 66 Mustang w/out power
brakes. Which makes me think the dealer is right. Any help would be much
appreciated. Unless a miracle happens here, I will have to sell it as is. I
have already spent around $5000 on the car in the last six months. I know it
isnt going to sell for that.

Thanks in advance,

Terry
1987 944s (sick at this time)
