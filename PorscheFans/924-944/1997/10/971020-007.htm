Ok Folks, it has been two months since I replaced my O2 sensor with the Bosche 
13913 Ford Mustang Sensor. I have waited on posting my results as I wanted 
some time to make sure everything was working well.

Vehicle:  '86 NA 944 236,000 miles, '87 engine, K&N, Aftermarket Chip

Gas Mileage: 
  o Bought the car last fall, the O2 sensor was clogged or otherwise not 
    working and was disconnected. ~17mpg with it disconnected, no better
    with it connected (and the car didn't run well either).
  o With the new 13913 sensor I now get ~26mpg with similar driving (recent 
trip
    through Maine on back roads with lots of passing at WOT)

Power: 
  I can't say there is any power loss as WOT, but at partial throttle 
positions, I feel a stepping as engine power increases. This stepping behavior 
is not present with the O2 sensor disconnected. I have yet to try the stock 
chip, could be an artifact of poor mapping with the aftermarket chip 
(installed by the PO, I wouldn't have wasted my money).

Overall, I would have to say it was a successful replacement. I do not have 
the equipment to test emissions or Lambda ratio, so the engine may not be 
operating in closed loop mode at the correct Lambda ratio. In Russ McMullen's 
post at the end of August, he stated that various Lambda sensors have 
different outputs at a given Lambda ratio. I believe Russ included a table for 
the stock unit, but not for the Mustang unit. If I knew how far off the curves 
were,  I could possibly tweek the mixture bias to compensate.
  
  I would recommend using the Mustang unit as a replacement to save some 
money. It only requires some minor soldering to connect the stock wiring to 
the new unit. If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to send me a note.

Good Luck,
   Ezra
