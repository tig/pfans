Alright, I just gotta check.  Maybe some people have taken a trip to the
twilight zone, or maybe I'm lost in sapce and don't realize what all the
complaining is actually about.  So, here's the question.  If a clutch lasts for
100K miles and then the rubber center breaks, does that mean it's a Porsche
manufacturing defect?  I'm just checking because I only got 120K from a Honda
clutch a few years back and that car had less power on tap for the clutch to
handle.  Of course, it completely failed and left me stranded, but at least the
center of the disk (once removed) was intact.  If the rubber centers are failing
at say 50K then I completely understand the complaints.  This is my first
Porsche and so far the clutch is on borrowed time in my eyes (98K) so I'm
smiling bigger at each mile is survives.  Now the COST of such parts IS
completely rediculous.  I just wonder how much of that cost is Porsche doing and
how much is the whining, spoiled, mob-driven, lazy, overpaid, underworked,
United Auto Workers Union's influencing the taxes charged on imported parts to
save their pathetic, noncompetitive jobs.  (Two years working for Chrysler
haven't made me bitter at all, right?).  Sorry for subjecting the list to my
Union opinions (Now Bill go to your room until you can be nice to the
mobsters).  The point actually was to find out if there is more to the clutch
issue than I've managed to grasp.  100K miles is about all I expect from mine,
and I suspect the parts are quite heavily taxed to insure that the UAW stays
employed.
