I just bought an S2 and there's already 5" of wet snow on the ground.
Highly annoying.

Here's my 0.02CDN:

I've come to the fairly-annoying-to-vendors conclusion that it is awfully
hard to beat the factory if you want to drive the car on the street - and
you said almost all your driving would be there.

After new tires, your suggestion of shocks is exactly what I'd do if my
shocks needed replacing. Sport Koni's are now double-adjustable and seem to
be the popular choice. (Everyone runs them on the soft side on the street,
anyway.) After the struts are put on get a good alignment and adjust ride
height if necessary. I wouldn't do anything else (except maybe rims) on a
street car that sees very little track.

OTOH, you may want to get rid of some of that body roll. The M030 option
did that by lowering ride height and using stiffer progressive rate springs
in the front (28 N/mm vs. 23.8 N/mm) and a slightly larger torsion bar in
the back.(25.5mm vs 24mm). Surprisingly (to me, anyway), the stock
anti-roll bars were not changed (Stock is pretty decently sized at 26.8 x
4mm at the front and 16 mm in the back).

Given that's how the factory did it, I'd change springs before the
anti-roll bars. (The reverse of the usual.) If you want to go further, all
kinds of bigger bars and stiffer springs (including coil-overs) are
available from the aftermarket. IMHO street ride will suffer unless
progressive-rate springs are used. The only aftermarket components I've
experienced are Automotion's and their autocross setup (I think it was 250
lb springs, 28mm torsion bars, and 28mm f / 22mm r sway bars) is very nice
while being streetable. I prefer the M030, though :-)

An excellent article on suspension setup was written by Jim Pasha and
published in May '94 Excellence magazine - well worth whatever they charge
for back issues.
