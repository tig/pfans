Hello All,

I know this topic was posted earlier, but I still have several questions 
about the actual number of Turbo S models that were produced.

I have a copy of a letter from Ludwigsburg dated 11-10-1991 signed: O. 
Lang and K. Resch.
"The total number of 944 Turbos built for the model year 1988 was 4087. 
Of this number 1006 were 944 Turbo S models of which 399 were sent to the 
U.S.."

A recent post states:

>On Wed, Feb 26, Gary Windham asked how many 1988 944 Turbo S cars were

        >Total USA:  718
        >Total Rest of World Markets:  917
        >Total run of 247hp engines for '88 model year:  1830

Someone must have the "exact" number?

The reason for the inaccuracies is the way the numbers are stated and the 
confusion when the "limited edition" and the Turbo S are stated. Also the 
"model year" for the US and other markets is different than the actual 
month/year the car rolled off the assembly line..

Here you"ll see what I mean.

How many 1988 limited edition(silver Rose Metallic) models Worldwide?
How many 1988 limited edition(silver rose metallic) models PCNA? Remember 
that "PCNA" also includes Canada!
How many 1988 limited edition(silver rose metallic) models USA?
How many, and what "different" color variations were there of the Turbo S 
(non silver rose metallic) produced in 1988? (this was not really 
publicised by Porsche because of the risk of affecting the limited 
edition status of the original production run.)
How many 1989 Turbo models worldwide? (this was the Turbo S, without the 
"S")
How many 1989 Turbo models PCNA? How many PCNA/USA?

The production information in "The Porsche 924/944 Book"p.167, by Peter 
Morgan conflicts with the letter I have and the "Porsche Buyers Guide" 
p.148, by Dean Batchelor.

The 944 Turbo S Sales Brochure states: "Only 1000 944 Turbo S models will 
be produced. Less than 500 will be made available in North America"

The Information Technik 944 Turbo S # WKD 495.021 states that the 
production run was limited to 1000 cars for the 1988 model year

I have also heard "rumors" that due to customer critism the 
plaid/burgundy interior was not the only interior available for 1988, 
even though the silver rose metallic was not changed during this 1988 
model year. I have "heard" a total of 376, which tranlates to 715 for the 
US market (see Porsche AG letter quote above)

HERE IS WHAT I COME UP WITH after reviewing all the Information I have.

1635 1988 Turbo S for the world market (not all Limited Edition)
1006 1988 Turbo S "Limited Edition" for world market
 718 1988 Turbo S and "Limited Edition" Turbo S for the U.S. market
 399 1988 Turbo S "Limited Edition" for the U.S. market
 379 1988 Turbo S "non-silver rose metallic/plaid/burgundy interior

How did I do?


I really would like to know the real numbers. Is any body interested in 
writing a letter to Porsche AG? How can we clear up this confusion.
