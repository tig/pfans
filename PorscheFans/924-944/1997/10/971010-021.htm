Gary,

I also have a strange brake light problem.  When the oil light comes on,
the brake light comes on too.  I believe it is a short in the wiring
harness.  My horn doesn't work unless the wiring harness is positioned a
small distance from the bracket.  I put a spacer underneath the bolt that
attaches the harness to the bracket.  I gave up on the brake light problem
once I got the horn and the clock to work.  It looked like a major job to
replace the wiring harness as there are over 100 wires attached to it.

Good luck,
Robb...

Hi again,
 
Thanks to everyone who has helped in the past. Here's another one:
 
I have a 1991 951 with a strange problem. A while back I posted that the
brake lights stayed on every once in a while. Checked everything out and
couldn't find the problem. THEN I realised something else about the
problem... the brake lights are actually coming on when I depress the
clutch! Yep, brake lights when braking and when gear changing!
 
I've bent over backwards (the only way to get a good look) to examine the
linkages in the drivers footwell and can't find any wires close to the
clutch pedal or linkages that could do this. Any clues?
 
The car is ex-UK via Japan (a Brit who was transferred to Japan took the
car with him, it was bought by a New Zealand dealer, and I bought it). A
cat was added in Japan... could the electrics (just temperature sensors, I
assume) for this be interfering?
 
Thanks for any input!
 
Cheers, Gary
