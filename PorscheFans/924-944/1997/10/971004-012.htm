Yes it seems to me those people would probably be happier in 928's since
they can have the automatic and the extra power needed to go along with it.
 To me, looking for a car with an automatic 'automatically' puts one more
into the personal luxury car market segment.  There are certainly many
other cars that do this type of thing better than a 944.

Well.. I had an 85.5 stick, and yes, it was quicker off the line. I now
have an 87 automatic and don't mind it a bit. I live in LA and automatics
have it beat over sticks all day long when you're stuck in traffic. You buy
these cars for the handling anyway, and the "fun factor" certainly exists
in my car. I didn't go looking for an automatic, but I was pleasantly
surprised after I bought it.

Preconceptions die hard.....
