Hi all

Been while since i posted but I always enjoy reading the digest 
every morning.  Wondered if anyone could help on the following 
problems on my 1992 968 coupe.

1. I have what sounds like a dry bearing noise from the steering 
column.  I know that the PAS system on the 944 variants have a noise 
at full lock and I don't think this is the problem.  I a kind of 
groany whiney noise as I am turning the wheel.  Its very loud and it 
stops when I stop turning.  It is not constant (which is why the 
repair shop can't help as it never does it when they check).  It 
seems to mostly occur when I am turning the wheel from lock to lock 
with the car stationary (parking etc.). any help would be appreciated.

2.  I also have a question about radio reception.  I have been 
finding that when I enter a city all radio reception seems to 
disappear.  I will eventually get the radio checked but as I 
installed it myself I was wondering if anyone knew what the second 
separate wire that runs from the antenna was for.  I actually checked 
the connections to the antenna in the roof when I was installing the 
radio and discovered that this second lead was connected via a push 
in plug.  However this plug was disconnected and looked like it had 
been that way since manufacture.  I reconnected it and this seemed to 
make reception worse.  Although I had to connect the other end of the 
wire to a corresponding connection on the radios wiring harness to get 
it to work (even though the other end was disconnected). All very 
confusing!  Once again any help etc etc...

On the discussion about the design flaw of the rubber centred 
clutch.  I head the clutch replaced on the 968 just after purchase.  
The mechanic then found that the dual mass flywheel (which performs 
the same task as the rubber donut) was heading towards failure. ( I 
have since discovered that he was being rather more alarmist than he 
really needed to be.).  Anyway I had the thing replaced at a cost of 
approx =A31100 (about $1800).  Give me a rubber clutch anyday!  at 
least these are replaced every time the clutch goes and they don't 
cost as much.  I had a 944 before with a very old clutch in it, never 
gave me any problems.

As for the Caleb page..I think the guy is a whiner who just owned a 
car that was way too good for him, without first learning enough 
about it and the responsibilities (servicing, maintenance etc) that 
come with it.  IMHO of course :)

Thanks to every one in advance
