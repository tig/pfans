Howdy,

A few comments about the brake pad choice email I sent out a few days back.
When I said I like the Metal Masters for the street, I forgot to mention one
critical aspect of those pads, YOU MUST SLOT THEM.  Without the slot, I was
never happy with the pad, they always felt like they had new pad green fade.
I feel that it was the gases being trapped between the pad and rotor not
giving good feel and stopping power.  Ever since slotting them down the middle
(as most pads come), they have become quite a bit better, without that green
fade feel and with much better high temp stopping ability.  The Metal Master
still transfers too much heat to the rotor, but if you are getting up to
those temps, you should be running something with carbon anyways like
the Porterfield or Performance Friction or something.

Paul and I drilled his cycling valve last night, so Paul's car is now at
265hp and 273ft-lbs of torque at the wheels compared to 250hp and 289ft-lbs.
His HP and Torque curves will be much smoother without dips and flat spots.
We have actually reduced the boost level as can be seen by the torque figure,
but we hold the boost for a longer period of time.  I do not recommend this
mod to those who are new to boost as you are bypassing the factory control
of boost and as Larry had mentioned in the past, the factory system is very
good.  Drilling the cycling valve also eliminates the factory part throttle
0.2bar limit which helps modulating the throttle in corners so Paul can now
spin all the time like I do :)

Taking out the valve was HELL, I can't even imagine what a clutch job is
like.  I had to squeeze my hands between cylinders 3 and 4 under the intake
manifold and it was not fun.  It took like 3 hours to get that bugger out
and the hoses are incredibly hard to put back on.  I guess this is why these
things stay together so well!

Paul feels it was well worth my effort :)

Farzaan.
