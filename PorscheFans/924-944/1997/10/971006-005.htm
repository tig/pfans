Ok, I think I did a bad thing.  I posted yesterday morning about a smell while
the A/C is on.  So in my infinite wisdom, I decided to wash/degrease the engine
compartment so that if there is a leak onto the manifolds or anything like that
it would be more easily spotted.  Made sense at the time.  So warm the engine,
spray degreaser, rinse....no problem.  Driving the car (85.5 944) later and the
engine coolant guage drops to nothing..hmmm  not good, maybe water on the
sensor.  Shortly, overheat sensor and (!) light come on.  Pulled off quickly.
Engine doesn't seem overly hot.  Alright, I'm thinking, 97,000 miles and I have
all the records, and I don't think the waterpump has ever been changed.  If the
pump died, the coolant wouldn't be too hot, the guage would read low and the
overheat idiot light (provided they are seperate sensors) would register
overheat.  Ok, so the pump must be dead and the belt didn't break...I'm a lucky
guy (amazing how quickly my mind works eh?).  So I decided to check this idea
for validity.  Open the cooling system bleeder, start engine, before engine
heats up, rev it with bleeder open.  With each rev water squirts out.  Now I
think I know that the waterpump is pumping and there isn't any strange noises
from under the covers so I'm relatively sure the pump isn't seized up  (Alright
the first idea was faulty, but I'm still in the hunt).  As the car heats the fan
kicks on then back off a little later.  Ok, now I know the fan switch doesn't
think the car is overheating so it must be the sending unit for the guage.
Looking around to find it I locate what looks to be it hiding under the intake
manifold with some pretty hideously corroded contacts.  A wiggle and a jiggle
later on the wires and not only does that guage not work, but the oil pressure
is now reading zero.  While pulling my hair out I saw that the idiot light for
the oil pressure was not on, and I'm pretty sure there must be two seperate
sensors for guage and idiot light, so I'm somewhat assured that there actually
is oil pressure.  Ok, I drive it home where it now is sitting.  Anyone have any
input?  Washing engine is a bad thing?  Are there seperate idiot light & guage
sending units?  Where is the oil pressure sending unit?  Below the exhaust
manifold and forward?  What is the other sensor in front of the coolant one
under the intake manifold.  I'll be digging through Haynes tonight, but thought
I'd get some input from anyone who might know as well.
