The consensus among many of us AX/track drivers is:

OEM aftermarket rotors are fine for street and AX for all 944/951 cars.
 There is no major downside, unless you live in San Fransisco (hard on
brakes!!!).  Go ahead, save some money.

These same rotors may be okay for N/A 944 cars which go on the track,
 Depends on the car/set-up.  May also apply to normal 951 cars,which are
pretty stock.

Cars with chips, full weight and or Turbo S cars should not use oem
aftermarket rotors on the track.  They will warp/overheat, and after you've
had them turned, they won't last.  This includes the now defunct Euroselect
brand.  Buy only Porsche rotors from the Dealer.  Make sure they come in a
Porsche box.  Have them gas slotted if you are doing a lot of track events.
 If you must have drilled rotors, buy the 968 M030 parts from the dealer.  Do
not have any other rotors drilled.  The 968 parts actually have the holes
cast in during manufacture.

I pay less than $100 each for Genuine Porsche Turbo S rotors from my dealer. 
If your dealer won't sell them to you at this price, call Carlsen Motor Cars
in Palo Alto, CA.
