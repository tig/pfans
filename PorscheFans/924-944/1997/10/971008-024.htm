    My spouse doesn't really my my little red toy.  It keeps me out of
trouble and properly maintained a 924 can be an excellent and economical
daily driver.  Well....

    One day I needed to do some maintenance on the wife's car.  I took it
with me and she drove my Porsche to work.  I finished the work on her car
and drove out to where she works to retrieve my baby.  After I explained all
I had accomplished on her car (and she praised the fun of driving mine) I
went out to retrieve my car and drive home.  I returned in a minute to ask
her where she had parked my car.  She said it was in the Wherehouse parking
lot and walked me out to show me where it was.  When we arrived it wasn't
there and she started to panic.  Hoping it may have been towed instead of
stolen I went to the Wherehouse to ask.  My wife swore that they no longer
could tow from the lot but I went in anyway.  They knew right away what I
was asking about.  Apparently she didn't set the brake or leave it in gear
so, it rolled out into the middle of the lot and they had it towed.
FORTUNATELY, it was towed by a company that my ex-brother-in-law worked for.
I was able to retrieve it without having to pay for the towing and impound
fee.  Needless to say, my wife hasn't driven it since.  I'd let her but she
is too afraid she might hurt my baby.
