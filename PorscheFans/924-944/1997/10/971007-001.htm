Well after much see sawing back and forth I decided that the oil oozing 
out the back of the engine must be from the rear main seal.  I replaced 
this seal a few months back along with the clutch.

For those of you who do not recall, I had started this project to 
eliminate all of my oil leaks on my car.  I replaced the oil pan gasket 
(no small feat on a Turbo!) and the oil cooler housing gaskets and seals. 
 After replacement, I noticed a steady stream of oil leaking from behind 
the engine.

I stuffed tissues up around the main seal and either side of the oil pan 
behind the flywheel to try to tell where the oil was sourced.  Always the 
middle tissue was soaked.  Sigh.

Last Wednesday I prepped the car for the tear down, and a few nights and 
about six hours of labor later I had the rascal in my hands.  Oil was 
seeping past the lower edge of the seal between the crank case and outer 
seal edge.  Upon removal, further inspection revealed small sections of 
the old oil seal had caked to the lower edge of the crankcase.  I removed 
these contaminants, but they were not easily visible as the viewing angle 
required a mirror to see them.  I applied a thin coating of Wurth Orange 
Flange sealant and by Saturday, 1:15 PM and a total of 13 hours of labor 
later I had the job done!

I finished other details with the car by that evening and had my first 
drive with the Turbo in over a month!  The ride was very reaffirming.

The car seems oil drip free, but I am almost afraid to look.

One other note.  In a previous ownership someone had used what I suspect 
was antifreeze with phosphates.  I found some serious amounts of 
gray/silver past that had settled in the system at all of the low flow 
points.  I disconnected one of the heater hoses and did a complete flush 
of the system as best as I could.  Yes Kevin, I ran a cup of shout in the 
cat for about 5 minutes, too.

Moral of this story.  Change your antifreeze often and use only phosphate 
free coolant as recommended.
