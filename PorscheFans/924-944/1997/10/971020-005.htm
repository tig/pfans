     I would appreciate some comments on this one.  I recently had a dealer
     change all my belts (timing, balance shaft and accessory belts) on my
     1989 951.  After the belts were done I noticed a vibration (buzzing
     sound) around 3000-3200 RPMs.  The dealer corrected this problem and
     adjusted the belts after around 1700 miles on the new belts.
     Immediately, there was a high pitch sound.   Like a jet engine.  I was
     told that is normal and that the belts needed to stretch a little.
     After 2000 miles I brought the car back as the sound was still there.
     Based on another dealers diagnostics of the belts being too tight and
     the pulley bearings shot, the four pulley bearings were replaced.
     That did not resolve the problem.  The dealer then replaced the belt
     tensioner (this I had to pay for).  The sound was lessen by the new
     pulleys -- not sure if the belt automatic tensioner was required as
     this may give the dealer a way out of saying they screwed up when they
     adjusted the belts.  They checked the waterpump and claimed it did not
     need replacement.

     Any advice here, has anyone experience this before, should I worry
     about the sound (I just hope it's not the bearings on the water pump,
     even though the dealer said it appears good.)
