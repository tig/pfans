Hi,

I bought a 944S2 two months ago, and we are trying to figure out a
vibration problem.

Description:
The entire car vibrates in fourth and fifth gears, starting at about
2500rpm.
It is most noticeable at highway speeds, starting at 60mph, and worse when
it reaches 3250rpm in 5th gear.
The vibration appears to come from the back of the car.
You can feel it on your body (thgough the seat); through the gearshift
knob, and through the steering wheel.  Particularly if you try to change
lanes left or right.
The vibration is constant.  You can also hear it.
The amplitude is not very high, it is a high frequency mode that annoys you
to no end.

The car has,
New clutch
New tires (Dunlop)
Wheel alignment
Wheels balanced twice (at least)
Other new things such as front rotors, brake pads, etc.

Ideas that were suggested to me: 
Still a wheel and tire problem
CV joint
Drive shaft
Clutch (center rubber piece); but it is in fact new.

Any suggestions or advice that will make this car driveable will be greatly
appreciated.  I don't believe it was involved in any serious accident.  At
most, a dent on the right rear in front of the rear bumper which was pulled
out.

Thanks for your help,

Eduardo
