I have just bought a 1979 model 924. I am told that this is a 'Euro'
model and it has a plate on the left doorsill which says that it was
converted in Germany for export to the US. First question, what does
this mean to me? Second question, I had the CV joints out this weekend
(no grease in one) and what the hell kind of wrench do these bolts take.
I thought they were metric allen so that's what I used but a couple of
them seemed to strip out. When I washed them out I found what looks like
a 12 or 16 point star pattern-so where do I get such a wrench, and what
do I ask for.
Also, when I bought this car the speedo didn't work-got a cable from the
dealer and put it in. Noe the speedo makes sort of a scritching noise.
Do these cables need to be lubricated when they are installed?
Lastly (not to monopolize the bandwidth) where can I get an owner's
manual? The one which came with the car is in German and watersoaked so
that it can't be read. TIA for any help.
