I had a silent engine, but after having the water pump/ belts replaced, I 
now have the whine (not from a bearing, but from the actual teeth of the 
balance shaft belt).  The balance belt was floppy loose before the 
replacement, but now seems very tight (by feel, not by gauge).  This is 
after having my mechanic double check the tension.  He claims the noise 
is normal.

In any event, I hate the noise.  It drones into the cockpit and spoils the
atmosphere.  I am tempted to go back in under the cover and loosen the
balance shaft belt a bit.  A very slight bit.  I am sure I will be sent
straight to Porsche hell for doing that, but the worst damage that can
occur is a jumped tooth on a balance shaft cog.  There must be a
reasonable compromise between belt tension and noise reduction (don't do
this to the cam belt, folks).
