Snap On makes the tool, it's an 8 mm Triple Square, costs $20.00.

Clean the heads of the bolts with carb cleaner so they are surgically 
clean!  Tap the tool into place and slowly turn them out with constant 
pressure on the back of the ratchet.

>I have just bought a 1979 model 924. I am told that this is a 'Euro'
>model and it has a plate on the left doorsill which says that it was
>converted in Germany for export to the US. First question, what does
>this mean to me? Second question, I had the CV joints out this weekend
>(no grease in one) and what the hell kind of wrench do these bolts take.
>I thought they were metric allen so that's what I used but a couple of
>them seemed to strip out. When I washed them out I found what looks like
>a 12 or 16 point star pattern-so where do I get such a wrench, and what
>do I ask for.
>Also, when I bought this car the speedo didn't work-got a cable from the
>dealer and put it in. Noe the speedo makes sort of a scritching noise.
>Do these cables need to be lubricated when they are installed?
>Lastly (not to monopolize the bandwidth) where can I get an owner's
>manual? The one which came with the car is in German and watersoaked so
>that it can't be read. TIA for any help.
