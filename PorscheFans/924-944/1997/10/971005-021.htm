i think nothing makes us as a whole look better than being courteous and i
also think that if we (p-car owners) act like that A**hole on 48 hours (or
whatever is was on road rage i was watching)  then we should expect to be
treated poorly by others and looked upon as snobs and jerks with money.  it
is interesting though, i spoke to local authorities about different car type
owners and they seemed very favorable to P-car owners stating they were
usually most polite and in general were a better group of drivers: this is
something we should all be proud of.  nothing is better than earned respect.
