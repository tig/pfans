Hi all..Just thought I would add my vibration experience.
After fixing all the 'problems' that the previous owner (actually a friend of mine) had - clutch center, missing muffler baffles, wimpy shocks, ect. the engine still was rougher that I expected at (you guessed it) 3000 rpm. I was lucky enough to get George B. to give it a quick test drive. I think it took about 100 yds before he said "balance belt". So I drove home and took it apart to see. The lower pulley had been put in upside down....15,000 miles ago! Anyway- fixed it nine months ago and its smooth as silk. 
The vibration I had was center almost exactly at 3000 with a very narrow Q (band width).. maybe 150 rpm either way.
Beware of non Porsche educated mechanics! Any one attempting a belt job with out the factory manuals will find the markings on the pulleys odd!
