Hi fellow P-Fans,

I've got some info. This was something that i have experienced. For a
long time my car pulled strongly to the left side when i stepped on the
gas (in every gear). I had looked up every possible sollution that could
cause this. A few days ago my girl bought me 17" turbo cup wheels
(255-40/215,45)lucky me. When i had my first test ride, i noticed that
the very irritating pulling wasn't there anymore. The problem was broken
canvas in the back tyre. However, you can't see this from the outside.
If you fill it up to 5 bar or more (carefull) you might see a bump on
the outside. I was told that this can happen because of explosife acc.
It can also be a fabrick fault. It was a dunlop tyre (D40, 225/50). I
didn't knew this was possible. Hope it might help one of you.

Will (love this list very much) Bonestroo
