Hello all,
              I have a real problem that I hope someone can help me =
with. Recently I bought a 1981 924 turbo, I love the car! It has only =
21,000 miles on it and the prior two owners took reasonable car of it. =
Here's my major problem. I started doing a tune-up on the car today. =
Everything was going great, typical simple tune up excluding the fact =
that the plugs were the regular Bosch. It appeared as they might even =
have been the origional ones. Well 1,2,3 plugs no problem then WHAM!!! =
number 4 plug, tight as a drum, it budges a tad then no more...ok no =
prob a little WD-40 let it sit, try again....nope. I tightened it back, =
about an 1/8 of a turn then retried to losen...same problem. Ive had a =
similar problem in the past with my BMW 2002 and guess what happened =
when I forced it... Yes you know.the plug came out along with the =
aluminum threads..of course the only thing to do was Helicoil new ones =
in. Anyone with any idea please help, any suggestion, experiences ect =
would be greatly appreciated... the last thing I want to do is have the =
head removed to put new threads in it.
                                                            Thanks
