Hi (again) all!

Ok, for those that have been watching the saga of my 951's belt valve
and subsequent repair experience unfold:

1) The vibration was indeed the Balance shaft belt not being installed
properly.
Problem solved, car is smooth one again. Thanks to all who responded
especially George B. , George is da man!

2) Now! I cant get more than 12psi boost, car was doing 14.5 -15+ easy.
I know it's a vacuum line somewhere...does anyone have the factory
manual with a schematic? Perhaps someone would  be kind enough to fax
it? 201.674.5405 attn.: Marc

3) I know this has been beaten to death on the list so feel free to
respond privately.
What's the best place to purchase a 951 clutch package (i.e.:
cheapest)?, prefer the Club sport clutch.

Thanks in advance!
