I had a similiar leak on my 84 944 and it was from the cam cover rear
gasket.  You will need to get an inspection mirror in there to confirm if
your problem is the same.  I believe there were four bolts holding a plate
(engine lift point) and the gasket itself.  The gasket was a few dollars
but it was a bitch to get at, because there is very little room between the
cam cover and the firewall. (also the wiring harness for the DME is
jammed-in there as well as the o2 test pipe)  The oil travelled along the
head gasket and spilled down at a protrusion on the block onto the exhaust
manifold causing lots of smoke (and consternation). I also thought at
first, that the head gasket was leaking, but the Gods were smiling.  In my
case one of the bolts had spun lose, hence the leak but I replaced the
gasket while I was in there. (Part # 928 105 189 102) 
Hope the Gods are smiling on you too.
