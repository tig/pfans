   I believe anyone can have a good or bad experience with any company, so 
please everyone keep that in mind when reading all of these personal accounts. 
A while back someone posted about having their head re-built at Vertex, and 
the work was terrible. My question is, has anyone had a good experience with 
Vertex???? We usually hear from people that have bad experiences, and not so 
many that have good experiences (GPR nightmare, etc..). I have called Vertex 
for quotes, but have never ordered due to the nature in which I have been 
treated on the phone.

  I order primarily from Zimms. Their customer service is very good, most of 
their salepeople know many part numbers by heart, and know enough that I would 
suspect they double as mechanics. They will also come down in price, I usually 
call with the list of parts that I am looking for, they quote me, and I 
bargain with them on anything that is listed in Excellence or Pano adds. They 
will not come down to Vertex prices, but will come down, Since I am a repeat 
customer having done a bit of business with them, maybe that has something to 
do with their willingness to bargain. They have also gone out of their way to 
get items they don't have in stock and ship them separately.

I have attempted to order parts through my local Porsche dealer, but they have 
never heard of PPR, and have no desire to inquire about it with PCNA. They 
also have a VERY limited stock of 944 parts..If I call PCNA, can they do 
anything?
