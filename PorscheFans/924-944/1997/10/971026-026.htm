You can get a film on the oil filler cap if you take short trips (under 
two miles or so).  If the engine does not heat to operating temp for a 
period of time, natural moisture condensation in the oil will collect on 
the high points in the engine, including the inside of the filler cap, 
until engine heat evaporates it away.  The yellow film is protective oil 
additives emulsifying the water.

If this is the case, you must make an effort to drive your car for 5-10
miles occasionally to burn off the moisture.  Periodic condensation isn't
bad, but gradual moisture collection in the oil can cause premature wear. 
Regular inspection of the oil on the dipstick will tell you the story. 

The way to see if your oil cooler seals have failed is to remove the 
coolant reservoir cap to see if you have brown goo floating on top of the 
coolant.  If you have this, park the car until you can make the repair, 
lest you damage bearings within the engine.
