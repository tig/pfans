I'm no expert here, but I would not be too quick to condemn the booster unit.
Start by following the vaccum lines to their sources, the big and little one
coming from the booster. Also look for any other vacuum leaks. You should be
able to feel the vacuum on the larger hose when it is disconnected and the
engine is idling, though it may run badly when it is unplugged (put a finger
over it to check) Also, it possible that in the break some crud got sucked
into the check valve or one of the hoses. The check valve is the fitting on
the booster to which the hoses connect. Also look to see that it is seated
properly in the booster and that there are no leaks when the engine is
running (may sound like a hiss). Bleeding brakes etc. is likely not needed as
this sounds like a booster/vacuum related issue. When the boost is not
working the brakes will still work but with way more effort and it will feel
much different. This is assuming that the pedal does not fade to the floor
etc, which would be a hydraulic problem. Good luck, and don't pony up for
that booster until you've really checked it out good, if you have them
replace it they will surely find the loose vacuum fitting that is causing it
as part of the job, and charge you anyway.
