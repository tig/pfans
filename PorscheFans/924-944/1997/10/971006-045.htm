You've only been on for a short time.  Wait till some of the regulars
post like Barry, Kevin, Don, Jason, etc, etc.  These guys can change
a clutch with their eyes shut and one hand tied behind their back.
While we mere mortals contemplate how we are going to jack the car up,
these master mechanics have already changed all the pads, rotors and
bled the calipers.  Then, there's Jim Richmond, you will come to love
this man.  He is like the tip of an arrow, with us being the stem,
he cuts through all the crap for us to just slide in easily.  He's
currently building a stroker motor and has kept us well informed on
the progress.  I am also hoping that he will market a finished product
when he's done the R&D on his current setup :)

Yes, yes, yes :)  This is something that is easily seen on the dyno charts.
Forget about the boost control method and look at the two charts, both
are under my name.  One has the APE 2.7 chips with the drilled cycling valve
and the other is the Cup chips with the drilled cycling valve.  Both are at
the same boost level and use the same boost control (drilled valve).  You
will notice that the APE chips actually move the torque curve up and also
smoothen out the power increase (torque) to better manage the power
at the wheels.  This is noticeable when you drive as the Cup chips feel
stronger because it builds the boost in a 930 Turbo fashion, no power,
then too much power.  The APE builds it up gradually making it feel slower,
but it's the same in the end.  Of course, I stuck with the Cup computers :)

Absolutely.  My car is really difficult to drive in an auto-x because of
the boost lag, whereas I find Paul's chips much easier to drive even
though we have the same turbos, just different chips.

Your very welcome.  What I would like someone to do is to run their
Weltmeister car on a DynoJet somewhere so we can compare the results.
Be sure to get them to save the file on a disk so I can do comparisons
more easily using the PEPVIEW software.

>Does anyone else have other dyno comparisons available to contribute?

There are tons of dyno runs on the net for other cars such as Supras,
several V-8 things, and lots and lots of Civics!  Most of them actually
do quite poorly against the results we got with just chips, but almost
every curve I've seen has MUCH more low end torque than we do, even
other turbo cars.

>Glad to have found the Digest!!!

Glad to have you here.  Now, let's here about these suspension upgrades,
their costs, and most importantly, let's hear your good track stories as
well as your bad ones.

Farzaan.
1989 944 Turbo.
