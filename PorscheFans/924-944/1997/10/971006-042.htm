WOW!!! The digest is OUTSTANDING.

I'm new to the digest, but not new to 944's... they've been the only Porsche 
I've wanted (short of a twin turbo, maybe) and owned for the last 3 years. My 
first was a pristine white "86 951 w/white center Fuchs wheels and biege 
leather. The next a Cobalt blue '89 951 w/biege interior. And the latest an 
'88 951S that is Stone Grey Metalic with light grey leather. The '88 has 
received KMR's solid front suspension treatment w/adjustable camber (more on 
that later), Weltmeister strut brace, chassis balance and max stock lowering, 
968 Cup Car drilled rotors w/Pagid carbon/ceramic pads (also more later), R1's 
on the stock wheels for drivers ed and SO-2's on 17" 3-piece C-2 Turbo wheels 
for the street, 6-point belts w/C-pillar harness bar, and an AutoAuthority 
Stage II chip... so far.

So much for the background info. Now, to my question for the digest but 
particularly to Farzaan:  DO AFTERMARKET CHIPS ACTUALLY SMOTH OUT THE POWER 
DELIVERY ON 951's?

Although I didn't chip my '86, the power curve seemed to come on very strong 
around 3500 rpm. I would say this car experienced noticeable turbo lag but 
nothing as outrageous as a 930 for example. Now with both the '89 and '88 I 
have experienced both cars with and without AutoAuthority's Stage II chips. 
Before the chip, both cars demonstrated a bit more turbo lag than the '86 and 
did also pull VERY strongly to 6,000. However, it was my definate impression 
that the chip change smoothed out the power delivery by providing more power 
and, most importantly, more torque at lower RPM than the stock chip. You 
really noticed the difference on the track where smooth power delivery matters 
most.

I looked at Farzaan's dyno comparisons and the Farzaan.002 vs Paul.005 seems 
to support my observations. Not only does a chip produce greater peak power, 
but it also appears to provide more torque and power sooner than stock. I also 
noticed the horsepower curve is smoother and the torque curve flatter which 
also seems consistent with my observations. I also found it interesting to 
note the differences between different chip makers and the big differences 
they make in a DME turbo's performance. I also want to thank Farzaan for the 
dyno charts... they are OUTSTANDING information!!  If you haven't seen them, 
you can check it out at: http://buschurracing.com/dyno/

Does anyone else have other dyno comparisons available to contribute?

What have others noticed regarding chip changes and power delivery?

Glad to have found the Digest!!!
