I agree with Rick, $2300 for ANY running Porsche is pretty pathetic.  In fact,
it's insulting.  The 924S will be a little lower valued than the 944.  It's
based on aesthetics more than performance, but that's life.  As far as accuracy
of Blue book.  I got mine for a bit under book, and it's mint.  Yesterday, while
test driving a 968 the Porsche dealer said I should easily get $12000 from it.
I kinda laughed, (I paid $5700), but it does show that the book value isn't as
important as what a potential buyer would pay.  There was a crowd of people
around my car when we returned from the drive.  I wasn't impressed with their
968 much, so I guess I won't know how serious he was.
