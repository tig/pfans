Thanks to those who commented on my question to replace two tires at a
time.  To those who offered their tires for sale, thanks, but I prefer to
buy the tires new just in case there are any warranty problems.  Another
disadvantage of having the same tires on your car for six years is that
when the prices go up, it takes you by surprise.  Well, AVS prices
certainly are a lot higher than they were six years ago, and I figure my
options are basically two new AVSi's (225/50ZR-16), plus tax, mounting and
balancing, which will run me just over $400 and some change.  However, I
just found out I can get an entire set of Bridgestone Potenza RE-71s (stock
size) for about $150 more.  I love the Yokohamas and would buy them again
in a second, but has anyone had experience with the RE-71s?

Lastly, does anyone have a Momo steering wheel hub adaptor to fit an '86
951.  I'm also looking for a Momo "Daytona" wheel--sort of looks like
what's in the 911 GT-2.  Don't know if it will fit in terms of thigh
clearance, but am willing to give it a try.

Thanks again,

Chris Robyn
'86 951
