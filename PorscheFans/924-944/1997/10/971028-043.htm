Hey everyone!

1.  I just got a good used set of Flofit seats for my 944...I tried the 
mounting rails that came with them, but the seats were too high.  So I 
took the rails off of the old seats, spaced them on the new ones with 
1/4" washers, and they are now the same height as the original seats I 
had in the car.

2.  If you need leather for your car, Alan Gunn Leather Accessories 
(AGLA) is the place to get your stuff!  I got a new shifter cover and 
wheel cover, and the leather is top quality, just about the quality of 
the Porsche stuff.  They advertise in Excellence and Panorama.

3.  I am lookin for a set of either 5-spoke Fuchs or the 944S2 8-spoke 
wheels to put on my car, in 16".  Anyone got any for sale?

4.  I am planning on replacing the o-rings on my fuel injectors...I 
might get a some from AutoZone...I'll let you know.

5.  I need to to replace my front bushings...what should I use?  
Original equipment?

Life is short...corner hard!
