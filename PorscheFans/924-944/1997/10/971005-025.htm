It's not about how much money you spent, but rather that you made a
decision to buy a Porsche instead of another car. I mean, _we_ know there's
something special about this marque, but to most people it's just another
sports car, and one which doesn't particularly appeal to the sensibilities
of most car buyers. Few people understand why we would spend (x) dollars on
a six- to ten-year-old car when we could buy a new(er) car for the same
money. Your 993TT friend very well might have owned a 944 or other Porsche
previously--that's certainly my intended upgrade path. :-)

Group hug, everyone?

Seriously, though, I think the era of Porsche as a statusmobile is over.
For one, the sports car craze is over; SUVs are the trendy vehicle now.
Furthermore, the guys who want to drive their checkbook have more choices
than ever: Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, Range Rover--all of which are fine
vehicles, by the way--my point is that the "expensive car" market is much
larger than it was five or ten years ago. The net result: Auto market
evolution has turned the species of Porsche owners into a leaner, meaner
group of enthusiasts. Fine by me...adios, gold-chainers.

On the waving issue: I've noticed that the propensity of P-drivers to wave
varies by geographical region, and in particular, the number of Porsches
per capita. Here in the SF Bay Area there are so many Porsches that hardly
anyone takes notice, including other P-drivers, who usually don't offer or
return waves. Where Matthew lives, in Central Texas (I've also lived in
Austin and Dallas), there are far fewer Porsches on the road and therefore
when you see one, it's more likely to be an enthusiast owner/driver.

My $0.02.
