My 924 has bad valve guides (I think.) Symptom is large puff of oil
smoke on startup. It uses about a quart of oil a week . I don't know if
that's bad or not.
My actual questions are;
1. Can these valve guides be replaced without removing the head? I have
done this in the past on other cars.
2. Since I also see other problems (i.e. broken exh. manifold studs)
would it be possible to find a used head, have all the work done on it
and then do a quick changeover? Or am I dreaming? How much would a valve
job cost in this scenario?
BTW, I notice there are not very many posts re:924 models in this digest
and on the alt.porsche newsgroup. Are they not popular? Or, were not
very many of them made? I have also looked through some copies of
'Excellence' and it's the same deal. Can someone enlighten me?
