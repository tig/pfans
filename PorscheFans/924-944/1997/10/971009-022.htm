Hey you "R" tire guys, don't forget about the newcomer, Kuhmo!  They make
a tire called the Victororacer or something stupid like that, but they
stick well and are almost as fast as the R1.  In AX, they seem to be as
fast as teh R1, but on the track, they are slightly slower.  Scotty White
has been running Kuhmos on his 944S2 and has kicked butt out in the NorthWest
Region in PCA.  Paul recently switched to Kuhmos on his 944T.  You can run
a 245/45R16 on the front 7" rim and a 265/45R16 on the rear 9's with no
problems.  They are HEAVY tires, but they work well and last forever.

Personally, I am buying a set of R1's next year in 235/45R17 for the front
and 255/40R17 for the rear on 17" rims.  I want to upgrade the brakes to
the red calipers and they require 17" rims for that.

If Kuhmo has something in 17", I will consider them for my next tire.

Farzaan.
