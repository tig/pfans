P-fans,

I am contemplating a road trip at the end of the month (assuming El Nino
stays out of the way) along the California Coast from San Francisco to Los
Angeles.  I plan to stop overnight somewhere along the way (San Luis Obispo
or Santa Barbara) and basically take it easy the whole trip.  This is not a
Cannonball Run or Gumball Rally type of deal.  Anway, my question
specifically concerns tires.  I probably hold a record for the length of
time I've had tires on a car(?)  I have an '86 951 with stock phone dials
running stock tire-size, i.e., 205/55-16, 225/50-16.  The tires are
Yokohama AVS Intermediates which have been sitting on the car since
1991--and this represents approximately 30k miles of use.  The fronts,
incredibly, still show a considerable amount of tread and no uneven wear,
but the rears are nearly gone by comparison, and the thought of taking them
400+ miles along a winding coastal road is not appealing.

Has anyone (with the exception of NSX owners) ever changed only two tires
at a time, rather than all four?  It's an economy issue, but the situation
with uneven wear is baffling--the fronts are good for at least another
10-15k miles, I'd say.  Can I get away with replacing only the rears?  The
car is chipped, which may account somehow for the seemingly
faster-than-normal wear on the rears, but 30k miles from AVS's seems well
within the ballpark.  Since there is already a pattern of uneven wear
between front and rear, should I just go ahead and replace the rears, and
then prepare to replace the fronts a few months' (or possibly a year)
hence?  The car is driven only occasionally, so when I say long-term wear I
really mean it within the context of three to four years down the road.
Are there specific concerns re: handling that I should be aware of with new
rears and older fronts?  I'm basically trying to save myself a few hundred
bucks if possible, but it's not worth it if safety/performance is
compromised, so any advice is appreciated.

TIA
