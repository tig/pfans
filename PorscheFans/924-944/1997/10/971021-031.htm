How tough is it to replacement the cam chain and tensioner? I'm hoping
there's a way that will not involve removing the timing belt.  Having at
least looked at the chain, it seems that loosening the cam bearings and
removing the rear bearings might let you slide the chain down the cams.
Another option I've heard is to use a universal chain of the same length,
and lock the links after installation around the new tensioner.

On the latter point, I would like to hear from anyone with an S2 that
bought an aftermarket chip and thought that it perked up performance
sufficiently to justify the cost.
