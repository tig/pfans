Consider having your car insured for replacement value.  You should have 
the ability to have your car insured for a higher value than book price 
if you want it to be.  Obviously, this will reflect in your premiums, but 
I seen this done before and both parties, insured and carrier, have made 
a commitment that they will have to keep.  You can also cover additional 
items added to your car.  Always take pictures and have it appraised.

Also, shop around for your next carrier.  Even in New Jersey you have the 
right to choose who provides your coverage.  The cheapest plan does not 
always have your best interest in mind.

Court, and attorney costs will be born by the looser at settlement.  In 
most cases claims never get to trial and are settled out of court.  My 
experiences have made it well worth the investment when legal assistance 
was brought to bare on problems.  You should be able to consult with an 
attorney for free.  I would consult with a few just as you would get 
multiple estimates for collision damage.  Despite their reputation, when 
the chips are down, attorneys can provide invaluable services.
