Howdy dudes,

In yesterday's digest, there was a mention of someone using EBS to buy
their Wide Fire Ring Head Gasket.  Just thought I'd drop a note about Jason
at Paragon for some of the newer guys on the list.  When I buy a part,
and I usually buy a lot of parts during car ownership :), I prefer to buy
from someone who contributes something to me, usually in the form of 
their knowledge.  I have not dealt with EBS so I am not in any way putting
them down, I'm just bringing to the list's attention the great amount of
help people like Jason and George have provided.

In my opinion, supporting them, even if it may be for a few more dollars,
saves us 10X that much in the future when we turn to them for their 
knowledge.  BTW - I'm sure Jason would match EBS's price if he was higher.

Behind the scenes, these guys ALWAYS answer private email questions quickly
and completely IN-DEPTH.  My vote goes for people who support this list!
Companies that contribute which come to mind, Don Istook, Jason Burkett,
George B, and I'm sure there are more that I've forgotten.

Farzaan.
