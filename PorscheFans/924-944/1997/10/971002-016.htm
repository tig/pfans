Hey,

I would like to add my experience with Vertex to the list discussion.  =
They seem to have good prices, but there service is horrible and the =
guys on the other end of the phone seem unknowledgeable and =
disorganized, in my experience.

I only ordered two things from them - a water hose and a K&N cone filter =
kit.  They had trouble finding the part number for the water hose (it's =
the one going to the main goosneck into the head).  And the K&N kit I =
recieved had to be missing some hardware because there was no way to =
mount the filter or it's baseplate to anything.  It had been obviously =
used before too.  I sent it back, but they did credit my card promptly =
though.  I wouldn't order from them again.

I've had good luck/prices from Don McGill and Zims.  Automotion is =
great, but there prices are sometimes lofty.  Also, don't forget you =
friendly Porsche Dealer!  A lot of parts have come down quite a bit with =
PPE, especially the more common items.

BTW, does anybody know of a K&N cone filter kit for 951's that *fits* =
and comes with mounting hardware?  I don't want the airflow meter and =
filter just sliding around like the one I tried before.

Wasn't complete until I got married,
Now I'm finished.
