PFans:
I've only had my '88 944 NA (73k) for about a month but I think its great
and the Fans subscription is very interesting. Can anyone advise on the
following queries I have:

1	My car has no cat. and I run it on leaded (Low lead?) but under heavy
acceleration tends to knock (pink). Is this normal or a problem with the fuel?

2	The PO fitted non standard wheels and tyres, 225/50ZR16 front and
245/45ZR16 rear. I noticed when fitting new tyres that the later T and S2
had this combination but the tyre pressures were changed from F/R 29/36 to
37/37. Which should I use?

3	When the car is warm and running at low speed there is some times a
grumbling noise as the steering is moved. Is this a problem with the PS?

4	I'm having trouble getting a manual for the 944 in the UK. Which is the
best one to go for and what is it's ISBN number?
