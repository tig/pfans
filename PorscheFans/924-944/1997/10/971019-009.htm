Hi Craig, yes this is normal. I was also concerned when I tested my
factory LSD as you did. I asked 2 Porsche mechanics ( 1 at the dealer)
both confirmed
that the design uses a cone? setup and because of that the car has to be
in gear with torque from the engine applied to it, for it to work/be
tested. Not easy to do. Easiest test is to auto-x and try tight turns in
1st gear. Helps if someone videotapes your run. I don't get any
inside wheelspin. As compared to my buddy with a non-LSD 968 who can't lay
down the power in 2nd gear in a tight turn in the dry on the street 
without inside wheelspin. The mechanics also said it was rare for them to
see a worn out LSD (mind you I don't think they work on a lot of cars that
are raced). Also if you drive on a loose gravel surface (like my back
lane) and turn, I hear this "chuddering" sound (hard to describe) from the
LSD I assume. Same sound Camaros with LSD make when they turn a sharp
corner (Detroit Locker?).

In my research and talks with Porsche experts they say Swepco, Mobil 1,
Amsoil and Redline work well. Some have added GM or Ford? LSD friction
modifier successfully. Regarding Redline, it seems 75W90 Gear oil GL-5 is
the one. MTL is 75W80 GL-4. Specifically told not to use NS because of
wear on a street driven car. Don't remember why "shockproof" was not
recommended.

I haven't seen any posts WRT non-oil cooled transmissions failing from
over heating. Would'nt hurt anything but your wallet though. All this
drivel is IMHO.
