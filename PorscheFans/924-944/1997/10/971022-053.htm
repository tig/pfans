well i looked at the site and what we have is some obviously pissed off
people who have not got a clue about how to fix their car, no clue about
buying a used vehicle, and NO clue about porsche's...."This may be what
happens when a car that started as a vw is pumped up with steroids and
labeled "porsche"......"i've driven faster volkswagen's at half the
price"....."Japanese manufacturers give better customer service and 
support and their cars are less expensive (perhaps even better...can you
say NSX?)"......"The 924 & 944's are for the most part junk!"......i swear
i could kill each and every one of these people, who know who you
are......it almost makes my head hurt how badly i want to injure these
people.....maybe i am growing to attached to my little waterpumper, but i
tell you my roomies vette has been in the shop like 1000 times and cost 30
times more.....just some food for thought....
