Hi Dean, 
Mine definitely does not hold vacuum - using a spare vac line. it will not
allow me to blow into the valve, but it will allow me to suck (old exhaust
fumes?) out.  Is this normal?  You did say oral diagnosis was permitted.
BTW The car was not running when I performed this delicate procedure (thank
God).

The valve does not show up on my parts book (Euroselect), so I had a tough
time conveying this info on the phone to the dealer. Anybody have a part #
for this gizmo or it's 993 equivalent?
Thanks.
