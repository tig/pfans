While taking a little cutie on her first Porsche ride last night, we rolled the
windows up, closed the sunroof, hit the A/C and.....uggg what the hell is that
stench?  Ok, I know I've read about this on this list before, and I've tried to
find the threads on it, but I can't.  So, sorry for making someone repeat
themselves, but WHAT is causing that smell?  It's not a fuel smell, and doesn't
really smell like burning oil either.  You know that smell when you drain the
ten year old tranny fluid?  That is exactly what it smells like.  Only happens
with the fans blowing, so I assume it's in the engine compartment somewhere.
Charcoal cannister?  Today I took the car out again and left  the A/C on with
the windows open for a half hour.  The smell doesn't go away.

Needless to say the A/C went off and the windows/sunroof back open.  Thanks for
the help Pfans.
