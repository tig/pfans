Dear Fans:

I recently bought a 944 and plan restoration.  

I do have a problem with the electrical system however, known when I bought
it. 

I was told that relay Part No. 944.615.104.02 (the largest relay in the
relay/fuse box)      was faulty.  This relay I was told has something to do
with the control of heater/AC blower(s)  Problem manafests itself thus:

With the old (and new, since I bought a new one) relay in place, with the key
off, the a/c fan (as you look into the engine compartment, the fan on the
left) stays on.  This causes the battery to go dead quickly.  In fact, it is
almost like a dead short, as in a few minutes, the battery is dead.  

When I pull the relay out, the fan stops and all is OK relative to the
battery, however when the car is running, I have no control over the heat,
and in idle, the car tends to overheat.  While driving the operating temp is
ok

Has anyone had this problem or heard of it before?

Thanks for your help in advance

Richard Brakenwagen
