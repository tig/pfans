Tom,
    This topic came up last time the list had serious problems (GPR fiasco), 
for some reason, which I don't recall, the idea was shot down. I personally 
would be more than willing to contribute $5 to the cause if I knew it would 
help. In the interim, I am on Digest mode, and use the web page to keep 
updated with the latest e-mails. I simply goto the digest section on 
http://www.porschefans.com for today's date. When I want to check for new 
mail, I hit the reload button. Netscape keeps me at the current position in 
the digest for today and I scroll down to new messages. It is a pain to reply 
to messages, I cut and paste to e-mail program, and sometimes an e-mail 
address is not in the message to reply to, but it works most of the time..

I find this list to be a great resource, and a lot of fun. Lets see what we 
can do to keep it going! Perhaps we could petition PCA to host our e-mail list 
on their new VISTA web site?

Ezra
