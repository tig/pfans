Hello,

> find.  I planned to go back on my next oil change and swap out the bolts with the proper bolts and washers - just to make me feel good.  It isn't that hard to do with the mounts in place and I like working in small places.  Must use the proper Porsche parts, you know.

You have WAY too much free time :-)

> Well I ask the parts guy for some motor mount bolts for a '87 951.  He comes back with two.  I say "No, I need four for both mounts'.  He responds, suprised - "You replaced BOTH mounts ?".
> 
> Now I start thinking, who in the hell would go through the trouble of supporting the motor, unbolting the a-arms, unbolting BOTH motor mounts, unbolting the rack&pinion assembly, dropping the cross member, and then fineagling the mounts in and out for a couple of hours to remove only ONE of the mounts.  I guess from his response this is a common occurance.  I also assume even some shops would do this, if the customer wanted to save the price of a mount.   Talk about false economy.  If I didn't have the $80 for the second mount, then I don't think I'd be driving - anything.  

Yeah, some people do that. Then when the OTHER mount goes bad, they get to do it again.
When I helped a friend replace the mounts in his 86 951, we did both. Surprisingly,
the passenger mount was good! The PO replaced that one, now the driver side was collapsed.

I don't recall which bolts we used. I do know that it was a real PITA to get the new
bolts started into the new mounts. Then you get to turn them about 1/20" of an inch
each time. Great fun!
