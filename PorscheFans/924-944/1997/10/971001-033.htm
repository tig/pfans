Wait a minute!  500-1000rpm later?  I thought the 951S was supposed to
have more low-end torque and be less stricken by the turbo lag syndrome as
compared to the 951.  I was always curious as how these claims were made
given the turbo was supposed to be bigger. So then what does this car do,
drag its rear end until 3500rpm then light up its rear tires to the
redline?  I thought that the redline and the compression ratio for the two
cars was the same, which would make the usable (ok fun) rpm range of the
car even less.  I find it hard to believe that the chips make the
difference by themselves, is the fuel delivery system or something so
different that it makes up for the bigger turbo?  What am I missing here?
 
This is not intended as a flame, I am just very curious.
