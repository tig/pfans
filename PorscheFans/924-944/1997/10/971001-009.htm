I have been reading with great interest all the mail about belt
replacement and adjustment - I have been changing mine for years without
the tool and as long as none of the reference marks on any of the
pulleys ( idlers, etc ) are moved it is a fairly simple matter to
tension the belts with a straight edge on the longest run between
rollers.  The gauge doesn't measure tension, it measures the amount of
play in mm. If they are tensioned too tight they will whine - just back
the tensioners off a little. Another cause of belt whine can be the
idler pulley for the balance shaft belt being in contact with the belt.
They shouldn't be - the belt should not be touching the idler. It is
there to prevent the belt slapping around when they stretch (as they all
do). The new idler pulleys also don't have a plastic sheath around the
outer edge of the roller and can be slightly noisier. Basically the tool
costs about AUD$1000 in Australia so maybe we have had to learn to do
without it. Also note that the camshaft belts tend to split
horizontally  and this is hard to see with just a casual check. I always
remove mine to check. The upshot of this is don't be afraid to get in
there and try yourself.
