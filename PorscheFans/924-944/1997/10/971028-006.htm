     Greetings,
     I'm a first time owner of great 87 944S, well maintained,clean,
etc.. 
     45000miles.  I've had the car about a month (and loving it)but,I 
     starting to notice a couple of things that I haven't seen in the
FAQ 
     or in the list.
     
     1) The clutch, which was replaced less than 2000 miles ago by a 
     P-mech. with a great reputation, is "sticking".  Actually, the
clutch 
     pedal is remaining engaged on occasion.  I can wedge my toe under
the 
     pedal and ease it out, but this is not my optimal solution. Anyone 
     with any ideas?
     
     2) The heater works for the first 15minutes of driving time, but
then 
     only blows cold air.  The defroster will work for a brief time
also, 
     but then nothing but chills. I believe the heater valve was
replaced 
     the week before I took ownership, could this be the problem?
     
     Any help is deeply appreciated,
     
     Will Wright
.
