	I was 18 when I got my 944... but its intresting so many
people expect a person who owns a porsche to 'be a certian way',
its just another purchace, you don't have to be black, white, asian
to get one.  You don't have to be frendly, kind, mean, snotty...

You just have to shell out some cash, and not even a lot of cash...
one can find a used 944 around for less than a used Neon.

Putting people into general groups based on skin color, age, 
religion or wealth is something that should be kept to a 
minimum :)  We aren't any better because we own a specific
type of car... nor should be made to act any way other than
ourselves.
