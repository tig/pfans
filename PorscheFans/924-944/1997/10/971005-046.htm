turbo were designed wrong and that I needed to have them reroute it.  Well
I instantly knew this was BS and they were trying to screw me.   >>
Not necessarily true. There was a factory recall on 86 Turbos to replace a
defective fuel rail. When teching cars for track events we found quite a few
with leaks. Check with a dealer to make sure that your system has been
upgraded.

Dear P-Fans
	I thought that the factory recall on 86 Turbos & up - was to replace a
defective fuel line - NOT THE RAIL!  If the recall was done - the fuel line
going to the fuel damper (on the front part of the fuel rail, toward the
front of the car ) has a double crimp where the hose fitting screws onto the
damper. 
           I would also inspect the fuel "return hose" from the fuel
regulator on the rail and to the body of the car (right front fender). It
seems that these two fuel hoses are exposed to a lot of heat from the
headers. I think it would be prudent to replace these two hoses if they are
starting to age and crack - before they leak fuel! 
	A special note: if you have been driving with a bad vibrations due to a
balance shaft belt off a few teeth, I would also inspect the fuel rail for
cracks! I have seen where a balance shaft belt will be off a few teeth and
cause the fuel rail or any accessory (ie: alternator/PS pump/ac) to develop
cracks. 

						Good Luck, David Jalali
