Just a thought, maybe the reason that some people don't regard us as true
Porsche owners is similar to the affinity some guys have for blondes,
brunettes, or red heads.  It could be just a cosmetic thing.  After all,
anyone who has ever driven or talked to someone who has driven them both
would understand that both are truely superior machines, put out by one of
the most superior engineering teams in the world.  But for the novice or
even the seasoned racer, the 944 is a much easier car to drive fast.
Marketing is everything, change is frightful but openmindedness divine.
