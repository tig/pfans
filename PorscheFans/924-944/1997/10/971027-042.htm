I would try to locate the crossover boxes within the door, provided they
are waterproof(ed) and don't interfere with the action of the window lift. 
With this done, just use the single factory speaker wire pair to feed the
crossover, and the two pairs to the woofer and tweeter will already be
within the door.  The tweeter level control should be a 'set once and 
forget' operation.  Once you are satisifed with the levels you can 
replace the door panel.

I am sure the quality will be worth it.  Please send a progress report, 
as I am interested in upgrading my speakers as well.
