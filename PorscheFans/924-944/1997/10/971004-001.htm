Terry,
Remove the leather boot (it should snap out).
Remove the retaining clip.
Pull the shifter boot off of the shifter rod.
By now you should see the shifter lever it is attached to the drive tube
by two bolts. These two bolts can be loosened and you can make an
adjustment here.
On the lever you will see a rod coming from the back it connects to the
shifter lever and has a c clip remove this. Inspect this point. It
should not be worn if it is replace the shift lever (about $33). While
you are here remove the 2 bolts & lift the entire mechanism out and flip
it over. Replace the white plastic piece also. These 2 parts can be had
for about $60 from autoatlanta. 770-427-2844.
If these parts check out you need to check your clutch.
