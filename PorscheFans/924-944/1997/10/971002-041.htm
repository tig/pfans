        I took my 86 951 to Midas today to see if they could weld a new t=
ip
on my factory exhaust(because the old one rusted out) and he said that if=

the pipe is bad the neck on the muffler was bad. (I think it had a leak
anaway) =

        So now I am looking for an aftermarket exhaust system(cat-back)
Would it be cheaper to have one custom fabricated using a borla muffler?
If so, who could do that....Or does anyone know of any decently priced
exhaust systems cheaper than $500.00...any help appreciated...

P.S. while I was about to hand over the keys, I saw a camaro get lodged o=
n =

the ramp that may car was about to go on, and seeing that the 951 sits
lower
I got in my car and left!!!!
