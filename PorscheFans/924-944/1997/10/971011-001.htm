The banjo bolt creates restriction in the line going to the cycling valve
and to the wastegate.  Air travels the path with least resistance so less
pressure gets to the cycling valve which means less gets to the wastegate
which means less boost shows up at the wastegate, therefore it opens
later than the factory settings.

The cycling valve does this same trick a different way.  It allows the
proper amount of pressure to come to the cycling valve, but rather than
allow it all to go to the wastegate or the portion the factory specifies,
it bleeds off a certain amount so that the wastegate no longer sees
all the pressure and stays shut longer.

The cycling valve is essentially the same method as Hansmen's bleeder,
whereas the banjo bolt is a different method.  The wastegate shim is
something I am still hazy on.  It increases spring pressure, but that
would only raise the wastegate default opening pressure from 0.2bar
to maybe 0.4bar.  Since the factory cycling valve is designed to allow
0.82bar, I am assuming that the range basically gets bumped up and now
you can get up to 0.82 + 0.2bar = 1.02bar instead of the 0.82bar because
of the extra "spring rate" the wastegate now has.  I don't know if that
is correct, but that is what I have come up with so far.

Farzaan.
Going to the track on Monday, will give report.
