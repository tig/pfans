Panorama recently had an article on the 968, but I do not have that issue
with me so I cannot check for sure.  Indeed, after some point(993?), the
911 should have both VarioCam and VarioRam.  However, I _believe_ (all of
this is from memory, I do not have the posts from the fellow P-fans on
these any more and I own neither of these two cars) that starting with the
S2, Porsche started playing with variable length runners.  An improved
version of the system was installed on the 968.  On the S2 at
approximately 4500 rpm (do not know when in the 968) a "flap"  switches
positions and allows the induction system to use a different route for
the air intake.  If I remember well, the S2/968 systems are quite
different in the methods they use, with the 968 using induction resonance
tuning and such tricks heavily.  

For another example, check out the intake system on the Audi 2.8l V6.  An
old European Car issue talked all about the different induction tuning
tricks, I will try to locate it and reference it.
