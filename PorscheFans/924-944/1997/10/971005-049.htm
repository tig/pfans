Subject: Optional steering wheel for the 924S

According to Craig Seko at
http://livewire.newforce.ca/rsr/rsrcar/924/cstart.htm, "An early option on
the 924S was a one-inch steering column extension that worked wonders
provided one's fingers were long enough to reach the control stocks. This
$50 CND option also gave a slightly smaller three-spoke leather steering
wheel, a bargain in Porsche terms as the steering wheel on its own was a
multi-hundred dollar option (stock was plastic)."

Is anyone familiar with this option? Is this the one listed as option code
018 on the FAQ at http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html? Is the
steering wheel provided truly smaller than stock (and if so, how much
smaller?) Is this option available as a part from Porsche, and if so, does
anyone know the part number?

I'm trying to keep my car legal under the SCCA Solo II autocross rules for
C stock, which state "For cars designated model year 1990 and earlier
alternate steering wheels are allowed provided the outside diameter is not
changed by more than one inch from standard size..." If I can prove that a
smaller wheel was offered as an option by Porsche (and show exactly what
size it was) I can install a wheel of the same size in my car and remain in
the "stock" class. Such proof can take the form of "...owner's manual,
manufacturer's shop manual, manufacturer's catalogs or other official
manufacturer's documentation..." Does anyone have any official Porsche
goodies that describe this optional steering wheel that they'd be willing
to photocopy for me at my expense?

Thanks in advance for your responses.

James
'87 924S


Dear James & P-Fans
	
	Have you seen the September (Tech Q&A, page 30) issue of Pano? In the tech
letters Kim Crumb describes a factory extended hub steering wheel (four spoke
type) for the 928. It was an option with the M018 on 928's (and other models)
up to '89. The steering wheel part #928-347-084-04-(plus color code). The
steering wheel is 30 mm closer to the driver. There was no price but I would
bet it is in the $500 range? 


						Good Luck, David Jalali
