Hi Kevin,
All the reasons mentioned by you make perfect sense. Would you consider =
the following however. Wouldn't calipers placed behind the frontaxle and =
in front of the rearaxle reduce the tendany to nose-dive during braking? =
Upon braking when the car is moving at a given velocity, the mass in =
motion will resist the change in speed causing a change in the current =
equilibrium of forces acting upon the mass. As the mass reduces speed a =
new equilibrium is constantly set, transferring forces in the direction of =
the motion. At this particular instant, the caliper will be the natural =
pivotpoint of the mass as this is the place the braking force is exerted. =
Because the car can only pivot over its axes, it will be harder to pivot (=
read: dive) over the frontaxle if the caliper is behind it. Why? Well =
because the length of the lever (read: length of the car IN FRONT OF the =
pivotpoint) is reduced with the difference in cms/inches caused by placing =
the calipers behind or in front of the axle. =
The opposite is true for the rearaxle. Bly placing the caliper in front of =
the axle, the pivotpoint is brought forward, reducing the leverage forces. =
Physics classes are way back when, so I'm open for corrections.

Kind regards,
Maurice
