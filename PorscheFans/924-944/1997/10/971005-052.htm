Hello all,

I recently purchased one of those redesigned throttle response cams for my
1995/2 944 and I have a small question regarding installation. I am hoping
that someone out there has done this before and can answer my question.

Steps one and three of the directions I received from Performance Products
were simple enough--basically I just replace the old cam and adjust the
stop under the gas pedal. However, step two as it was stated left me a
little confused. It reads...

"STEP TWO: Pry the section of the throttle cable that goes through the
firewall so that the two 13mm jam nuts can be broken loose. Force that
section of throttle cable back into the firewall and screw out untill the
slack in the throttle cable is almost completely removed. Just enough slack
must be left to allow the throttle to fully close with a "clicking" sound.
On the 1985/2 and later models, the adjustment is on the end of the cable
sheath near the throttle cam. If the throttle does not fully close, the
idle will hang at a high idle of around 2000 RPM."

Does this mean that on my 1985/2 Porsche 944 I can skip prying the cable
from the firewall and simply adjust the slack "on the end of the sheath
near the throttle cam?" If so, how exactly do I make this adjustment? It is
not obvious to me when looking at it.

I would greatly appreciate it if someone who has done this before could
e-mail me some more detailed instructions on how to adjust the cable slack.

Also: Are there any major drawbacks to this "improved" design that I should
be aware of?

-NEIL
