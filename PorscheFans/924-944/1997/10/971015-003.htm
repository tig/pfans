Those lines are not bulletproof, and I seem to remember having the same 
thing happen to me once when I replaced a master and/or slave cylinder.  
When you start disconnecting things and moving that line around you 
always risk a chance of it leaking.  That is probably what happened to 
mine.

I agree with Ezra that you should always get your dead parts back.  It is 
a good education and it helps keep your shop honest.

Also, any service shop is between a rock and a hard place when it comes 
to situations like this.  How do you call it when your little voice 
inside says that it is prudent to replace something that is currently 
working, but looks like it is about to fail?  If you don't replace it and 
it breaks, your an incompetent fool.  Replace it, and the customer cries 
rape!

The only recourse is to do what I do, D.I.Y.
