Regarding Wes Shew's post about C-V joint wear, swapping the driveshaft
assemblies to the opposite sides of the car is the way to transfer the wear
pattern of the inner and outer races from one side of their ball grooves to
the other. Just reversing each shaft on the same side continues the same wear
pattern. Alternatively, you could just drive the car in reverse most of the
time...just a thought....

About Joe Mitchell's question about the use of Weltmeister poly bushings: I
don't recommend them for a street-only car. I especially do NOT advise the
use of their poly bushing on the front pivot of the front control arm under
any conditions-it will destroy itself, a potentially dangerous situation.
I've had much experience with this particular part-all bad. The bushings for
the rear pivot of the front C-A, front and rear anti-sway bars and torsion
tube mounting work ok. For the front C-A pivot, a spherical bearing is the
only way to go for track use. For those who already have these bushings, you m
ust use Automotion's plastic bushing grease-it works, no squeaks.
