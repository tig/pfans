Subject: re: gear shift looseness

Terry,

I have the same looseness in mine(2-3 in. in any gear), except only
horizontal. My mechanic that replaced my clutch last year said I was
missing a bushing on the shift linkage at the trans. I didn't have him
repair it because the clutch job was an unexpected expense and he didn't
seem too concerned but it's not very expensive(~75+labor). I don't know for
sure if this will fix it since I haven't done it yet. I have simply lived
with mine for a year, the only problem is that it is difficult to get into
2nd. Next time I have any rear end or clutch work I'll have it fixed.
I'd like to hear other ideas if anyone has any(as if that needed to be
said...ha,ha)

Yours in motorsports,

Dear Joe & P-Fans
	
	Regarding your looseness (2-3 in. in any gear), in your gear shift linkage.
At the base of the gear shifter - there is a round shifter bushing where the
lever sits and pivots from, it is bolted onto to torque tube. This bushing is
held in place by two 10 mm bolts. Pull off your shifter boot, remove the two
bolts and replace the bushing, part #944-424-231-01, cost $2.00> use a little
grease for the "ball" (on the bottom of the shifter) to pop into the plastic
bushing socket. 
	There is also some adjustment on top of the transmission. The gear shifter
sits bolted on top of the torque tube a in a up right position (canted back
about 15' degrees), the shifter is connected by a rod that goes back to the
top of the transmission. On the top of the transmission (drivers - left side)
there also are a few bushing that hold the rod centered. You can loosen a set
screw here to make any adjustments so that the shift lever sits at the proper
angle - back at about 15' degrees. You might need two people to do this. The
set screw/bolt hold the "rod" to the little "L" bracket where it goes into
the transmission. 
	
						Good Luck, David Jalali
