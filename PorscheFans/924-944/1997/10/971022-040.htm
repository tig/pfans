Unfortunately I can tell you the difference.  The WET is exploded pictures 
of parts and each different part is numbered but there is no cross 
reference for the part number.  So, it is good if you just need an exploded 
view of individual parts but is bad if you are trying to order parts with 
it.  The PNA 000 147 A appears to have all the part numbers and is 
accompanied by a price list.  I say "appears" because I ordered this 
thinking that is covered 1989 models and it stops at 88 so I have not 
opened the shrink wrap.  It appears to be 5 identical books so that part 
number may reference a 5 pack (I also got 5 parts price lists).  If my 
local dealer will not take it back I will open it and let you know what I 
find.  If it is indeed a 5 pack I will be selling at least 4 of them.
