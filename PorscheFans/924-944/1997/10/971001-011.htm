A while back, I had a problem with my 944 starting up
in the morning.  The car would start up only to search
for idle and then die.  Start it up again, but this time, I
kept my foot on the gas to maintain the idle.  Once the
engine was warm, I had idle.

The cause --- my CO was way way off!  The CO
should be 0.6  +/- 0.2 (something like that) and mine
was setting at 2.5!  Way too rich for the idle speed
controller to maintain idle.  The reason why it was fine
when warm was because the O2 sensor was
warmed up and kicked in, which adjusted for the high
CO.

Check into the CO adjustment.  You can get a lot of
info from your emission readings.  Also, your Porsche
mechanic can make a few quick checks to see if your
ISC and O2 are working properly (10 minutes)!  It may
be as simple as that.  It cured my problem!

Good Luck
