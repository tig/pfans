Even though this is about a 911, it could apply to some of the members of
this list:

>The Porsche and the Moped
>
>A self-important young man goes out and buys the best car  available, a
>1997 Porsche 911 Turbo.  It is one of the fastest  and most expensive cars in
>the world.  He takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops at a red
>light.  An old man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next
>to him.
>
>The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, "What
>kind of car ya' got there, sonny?"
>
>The young man replies, "A 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo.  They cost $100,000."
>
>"That's a lot of money," replies the old man.  "Why does it cost so much?"
>
>"Because this car can do up to 180 miles an hour!" states the young man
>proudly.
>
>The moped driver asks, "Can I take a look inside?"
>
>"Sure," replies the owner.
>
>So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning back
>on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right!"
>
>Just then the light changes, so the young guy decides to show the old
>man what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 10  seconds  the
>speedometer reads 120 MPH.  Suddenly, he notices a dot in  his rear view
>mirror that seems to be getting closer!  He slows down to see what it could
>be and suddenly,  whhhoooossshhh! Something whips by him, going much faster!
>
>"What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche 911Turbo?" the young
>man asks himself.  Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him.
>Whoooooosh!  It goes by again, heading the opposite direction!  And, it
>almost looked like the old man on the moped!  "Couldn't be" thinks the guy.
>"How could a moped outrun  a Porsche 911 Turbo?"
>
>Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh-BLAMMM!  It plows
>into the back of his car.  The young man jumps out.  It  is the old man!!!
>Of course, the moped and the old man are hurting for certain.
>
>He runs up to the old man and says, "You're hurt bad!  Is there anything
>I can do for you?"
>
>The old man groans and replies, "Yes.  Unhook my suspenders from your side
>view mirror."
