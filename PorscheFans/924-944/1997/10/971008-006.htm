Hi,

Looks like I will be heading into the pre-purchase inspection phase soon
so I thought I'd querry the list for items that you think should be
specifically checked.  I am willing to pay for them (Porsche dealer) to
check the car thoroughly as I don't want any surprises from this =
potential
long distance purchase.

The car in question is a 1990 944 S2 with about 72K miles and not much =
(if
any) history.  I'd really like to hear from S2 owners too regarding any
problems they might have had with their cars.

Thanks, I hope this works out.  I already have my PCA app filled out :-)
