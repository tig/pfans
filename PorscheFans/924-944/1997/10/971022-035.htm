Well, the votes are coming in heavily in favor of replacement of my 87 924S
water pump as a preventive measure since it has 93K on it. I've been hearing
that there is no good reason why a rebuilt pump should not be adequate. Any
recommendations? Automotion has one for $99. which compared to most of their
stuff is not overpriced and has a 30 month warranty. Anybody out there used
one of these, and more importantly, anyone had any lemons, and from where.
There is a lot of price variation out there, which leads me to believe that
they are rebuilt by multiple source. I would gladly have an extra 5 pounds in
the engine bay for an external pump driven off the alternator belt and
available for 30 bucks, but I guess the porsche mystique has its price. (at
least I don't have the aluminum A-arms to worry about) One more thing. I've
seen some not-so-good press re Vertex, which unfortunately has the best
prices more or less. Any other thoughts on them? Any strong recommendations
for very aggresive pricing and adequate service? Thanks
