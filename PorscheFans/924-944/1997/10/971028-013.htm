To fellow 944 owners,

I've been doing a few studies about the bearings in the clutch and
flywheel area. What I've found is this:

The factory lubrication on the pilot and throwout bearings was probably
insufficient and of the wrong type. Typically, a moly-type grease works
best. The original throwout bearings for the 951 did not have enough
grease. This was complicated by the additional power being transmitted
and some owners doing clutch dumps.

The second issue is a little more serious. This concerns water or dirt
getting into the clutch area. On 924 and the 944s up to the 86-87 time
frame, the valve for the heater is in close proximity of the opening
where the timing mark is found. If the heater valve leaks, which does
occur, the hot water and coolant go right on in and "clean" all the
areas it touches. Pilot bearing, clutch release arm bushings and
bearings and throw-out bearing. The coolant will aid in disintigrating
the rubber in the rubber-centered clutches.

If you have some clutch chatter, have the clutch inspected and get it
repaired. If you have a problem with coolant level, be sure to inspect
the heater valve (near the firewall on the early cars, near the front of
the intake on the later) for leakage. Also note that the moulded rubber
hoses can get pin-hole leaks. 

If the clutch gets water soaked or oil soaked, for that matter, bite the
bullet and take it apart. Especially if the clutch becomes harder to
depress or these is grinding like it isn't disengaging.
