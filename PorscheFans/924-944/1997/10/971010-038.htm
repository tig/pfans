Jeff Fortenbery asks if 3 drivers ed and 3 autocrosses should cord BFG
R1s:

Jeff,

It is not clear how many days the drivers ed events consisted of or how
much time you got each day. My last set of full tread depth R1s lasted 8
track days with over an hour per day and 2 autocrsses as well as 1200 or
so highway miles. I started out at 27 cold, went up to 30 cold for a
while, and ended up at 26 cold. There was no EGOD. I was very pleased.

You car needs a lot more camber than 1 degree front. I'd recommend max.
possible in the front and 1 degree less in the back to help compensate
for pushing. Use a pyrometer to determine the actual amount you need. I
would guess your fronts corded due to overinflation.

Barry Lenoble asks about car setup:

Barry,

You are still a second a lap faster than me at The Bridge, so no advice
for you. ;-)

Sway bars are a comprimise way to lessen body roll - you need to get
bigger springs and torsion bars. Then you can use the sway bars for
their intended purpose - tuning the suspension to your own tastes. To
accomplish this, I'd recommend the Weltmeister rear bar. I would NOT
recommend the Weltmeisteer front bar as it has a habit of destroying
stock control arms - stick with the OEM bars in front.

Regards,

Paul Foster
