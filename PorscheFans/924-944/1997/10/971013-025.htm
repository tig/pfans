Depends if you have a pre-85.5 or not. Your signature indicates you
drive an '84 so I am confused about your reference to "a few clicks"
since the '84 has a rheostat in the headlight switch, no clicks there.
Anyway, asuming this question applies to a pre-85.5 here goes:

1. DON'T try higher wattage bulbs. I did this and while it worked great
with the instruments, a number of mysterious ailments appeared such as a
temperamental alarm system, spooked cruise control, and a headlight
switch melt-down. The pre-85.5 electrical system is a distributed model
and does not carry all the safety checks of extra relays to isolate
components within the system. As a result a brighter brake lamp bulb can
actually contribute to frying your cruise control computer, strange as
that sounds. Use exact specs and OEM when possible.

2. The headlamp switch itself is a relic. It builds deposits in the
dimmer rheostat arm, the resistor pack and switch contacts. If you feel
like playing with a tweezer and magnifying glass open it up and clean
it, otherwise buy a new switch and you will see an immediate improvement
in all lights if your switch is the original 13 yr old unit.

3. The bulbs get dimmer after 13 years and deposits accumulate in the
bulbs, outside, on the contacts and inside the instrument cluster
plastic facia. The best solution is to buy a pack of sixteen bulbs (you
will be surprised to see how many Porsche fitted into that cluster) and
replace them all. The pre-85.5 uses two bulb types which are not
interchangeable. Use a factory manual wiring diagram to locate all the
bulbs, there are some you are bound to miss (e.g. the one inside the
headlight switch and the one behind the heater controls that points down
so you can see the sunroof switch and stereo controls!).

With a new switch and bulbs and a clean facia you will need to dim your
instrument cluster when driving at night on highways and you should get
marginally brighter headlights and tail-lamps. If you drive an '85.5 or
later, you should get the '84 dash because it looks much cooler, has a
more logical arrangement, and puts up with none of that Japanese-car
look and feel -- instrument backlighting was still a crazy idea when
these Star Wars style units were made (in 1977) and air-bags were easily
confused with hot-air balloons! Good luck.
