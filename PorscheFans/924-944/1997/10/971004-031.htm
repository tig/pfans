Hello fellow Porschefans...

Seeing as there seems to be a thread going on mail order companies...

Last year I had a throttle cable going bad on my 1978 924 (Yes it's an =
Automatic ). I called Auto Atlanta to check on prices. They quoted me a =
price of $190.00 U.S. I almost thought it was a joke. So I politely decli=
ned to order at that time. The next day I called them again thinking ther=
e might have been a mistake. The guy was rude this time and said that the=
 price had gone up to $210.00 U.S. did I want one or not! The answer was =
NO! 

I called around to a couple of other companies. Tweeks and Automotion wer=
e very freindly and professional, but they didn't carry the throttle cabl=
e for 1978 automatics...

Part Werks of Chicago had one in stock and charged me $23.00 plus shippin=
g. The part was the right one, and it only took a couple of days to arriv=
e. A little better than the %210.00 that Auto Atlanta wanted.. 

I've ordered from Part Werks a couple of times, and they've even called =
me back a couple of times, when I had a question they couldn't answer rig=
ht away. That's a sign of a business that cares about their customers...

Well just my two cents worth. They say that one bad experience is told =
to hundereds, good ones are usually left unpraised.

Thanks for the band width...
