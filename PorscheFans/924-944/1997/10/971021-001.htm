>Anyone out there put a hitch on their 944?  Ok, no flaming, I'm only towing 

I have one on my 944. I don't know the brand because it was put on by the
previous owner, but it appears to be a Reese universal design with a 1 1/4"
square receiver (class II).

It is bolted to the underside of the bumper (two bolts), and is also
connected to the spare tire well with a T-shaped piece. The inside of the
well has a matching piece of bar stock (about 2" by 10") and a bolt at each
end secures that assembly. Note that this design eliminates the
"energy-absorbing" nature of the rear bumper.

I know a few people who have hitches on their 944's that they use to tow
small utility trailers (4' square) for tires, etc.

The factory makes a hitch but as far as I know it isn't available in North
America as it is designed to work with the Euro bumper and has a metric
ball (at least, that's what I've been told).

Factory rated towing capacity of the 944 is 500kg/1103lb without brakes,
1200kg/2646lb with trailer brakes. Maximum "drawbar load" is 50kg/110lbs.
