Dear P-Fans
	I will be replacing my front brake rotors soon and was wondering if there is
a inexpensive way to upgrade my brakes (other than drilled or slotted rotors
or pad composition)?  Can I install Turbo S rotors and brake calipers with
out changing my front spindles?  I would like to upgrade to a larger diameter
front rotor (my car has the std. 304 mm rotors) set up.  My front brake
calipers are making that dreaded "crunch" noise when the brake pedal is push
in. I do not think this is anything to worry about since Porsche has had a
bulletin on this noise. Since my car is a 1986 MY the front brake calipers
have the small pistons (36 mm/38 mm) I though I could swap in a latter
calipers with larger pistons. Will I need to change to the latter & larger
diameter brake master cylinder? Any information would be appreciated. 

						Sincerely, David Jalali
