To All:

Does anyone have a local non-dealer shop around Boise, ID or even
Pocatello.
Just cruised across from NYC in about 36 hours of driving and would
appreciate any recommendations.

A few thoughts about the trip:

1.  80 mph in a 65 is a still a ticket at 2 a.m. in a red 944. - 
$130.00 PA
2.  87 octane in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska is not the same
as 87
octane in NY. - Major knocking, problems didn't clear up till Wyoming.
3.  A NA 944 with 100K can still do 125mph in Wyoming.
4.  People still hog the left lane in Nebraska, Wyoming, etc. even if
the
are     the only car on the road for 20 miles and a red car is fast
approaching with     its' brights on.  
5.  Only saw two Porsches on the whole trip, both 944's a white one
around
Omaha, NE and a another outside of Rock Springs, WY.
6.  Needless to say, this kind of trip is recommended for both car and
driver.

Overall, aside from the bad gas/octane the car ran fine.  I'm still
trying
to determine if it was just low octane or my car has a major carbon
buildup,
or the knock sensor is out of specs.  All through western WY and ID the
car
was fine, so I hope it was just bad gas.  It never knocked or had fuel
problems before.

As a note, my SO and I ran the car for over 24 hours straight, just
stopping
for gas and the restroom. We averaged 82 mph, car did not signal any
problems and at 110mph the car seemed to be in a nice state.


TIA
