Khalil, I think you have really identified the crux of the matter in 944
vs. 951:  learning the skills to fully exploit the turbo is critical to
making the extra expense worth it.  I have driven a few 951's and sure, the
turbo is quite a kick, but as far as which car is better 'handling' has as
much to do with the driver as the car (witness what professional racers
have done with older 911 turbos that are aptly described as 'finicky'
handling).  I think for many non-track junkies, the potential of driving
the 944 to a high level of confidence is more likely than the turbo
precisely for the reason you describe.  I would venture to say that unless
you do the driver's school frequently, it will be harder to maintain that
confidence (unless of course you have a great road nearby that can be
driven at one's limits regularly).
