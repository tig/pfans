   Hi Pfans –

I've been following the list since I acquired my  '87 951 about August 1.  I 
got it cheap because it has a seized engine.  I've found the list very 
interesting and often entertaining.  Haven't had a reason to post until now.  
Thanks to all for the valuable information provided every day

The current status of my project is – The seized engine is out of the car and 
on a stand.  A used 951 engine is  on another stand next to it.  I'm in the 
process of  moving external parts form the seized engine to the used one.  

My question -  could someone supply me with the part number for the HD 951 
clutch ?( the one without the small springs in the hub)  It was  mentioned  in 
the last week or so, but I didn't note the number for reference.  When I 
finished drilling the last 3 clutch bolts (Stripped heads) and removed the 
pressure plate, I found that the disk was worn out and 2 of the  little hub 
springs were missing.

Thanks!
