     Just bought a 83 944 with a blown engine. He said it got load, and 
     stopped - he found part of a rod under the hole in the oil pan. the 
     car only has ~63k on it {if the odometer is working}.
     
     some questions:
     
     *  Is it conceivable to think I can rebuild this engine {if in fact 
     the
        rod only damaged the pan}?
     
     *  what could have made the rod snap - what should I look for?
     
     *  I know the engine has to drop from under the car - how bad a job is 
        it? are we talking 2 hours or 24 hours {for a good amateur}
     
     *  anyone have a good/fair rebuildable engine around they want to
        sell?
     
     *  will a newer engine like from 85.5 up work in this car?
     
     
     I pick the car up tonight, haven't even looked under the engine yet...
     
     
     Thanks for any help you can throw my way.
     
     
     Lou
     
     
     {I also have a good running 87 944}
