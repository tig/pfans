PFans!

        Some small questions:

        1. Anything to be done about the broken glove box door short of
buying a new one (which I probably            wouldn't do)?

        2. The plastic covering the instrument panel appears to be dirty
from the inside? Is there an easy way            to remove this for cleaning?

        3. My turn signals while all functioning appear to blink very fast.
Is this normal?

        4. Has anybody purchased the shifter repair kit for $47 advertised
in the mags? If so is it worthwhile?

        5. Does anybody make a sunshade specifically for the 944?        

        6. I have looked at seven or eight Turbos and S2's. None of them had
the front spoiler? My guess is            you can't keep one of them due to
the low clearance. Am I right?        

        7. My dash night lighting appears to be very dim when turned up as
high is it can be. Is this typical?


Enough already!! TIA

David Greenberg  

I love my S2
