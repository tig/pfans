Ah, this could be a problem and it is not something that I remember on my 
84 944.  Nevertheless, when you get down to it, traveling through 2 to 3 
inches of water at 30 mph is not a good thing to do with any car.  
Besides the risk of drowning the engine, the risk of hydroplaning is a 
far more serious threat.

To add insult to injury, I have learned an expensive lesson with a much 
loved British car I owned many a year ago when I struck a submerged 
pothole with my right front wheel (which was a 15" rim!).  Fortunately, 
the suspension did not collapse until I arrived at my destination a short 
distance later.  

When there is water on the road you can't tell what lives beneath.   And 
so fools gush in where others fear to tread.
