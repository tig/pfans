     I just last week attempted to convert my '89 951 airbag equipped car 
     to a Momo wheel.  I ordered the hub and an extender from OG Racing, 
     and grabbed a few tools.  Of course the task wasn't as simple as I 
     expected...
     
     After removing the airbag wheel, I found the plastic doohickey with 
     the coil spring that is the contact for the horn for airbag cars...
     I removed that plastic part (with the copper coil spring), and stuck 
     on my new hub adaptor and steering wheel.  Everything seemed fine, but 
     I had no horn, and the steering wheel seemed to bind.  So off to the 
     junkyard to study the non-airbag car assembly.
     
     The non-airbag cars don't have the plastic doohickey, but have a small 
     plastic part with a copper contact apparently riveted to the metal 
     plate.  The metal plate is the exact same as the airbag cars, but I 
     couldn't get the small plastic contact off.  I also realized the 
     plastic cover (that you see all the time) had a larger opening than 
     those on airbag cars.
     
     Of course the guys at the junkyard wouldn't sell any of the parts 
     separately, but wanted to sell the entire steering column as a single 
     unit.  So a wasted trip to the junkyard.
     
     The final resolution was to grind away on the plastic cover to allow 
     the new hub to fit 'inside' the cover.  Perfect, and the wheel no 
     longer binds.
     
     I don't yet have a horn, I'm still working on how to adapt a contact.  
     But the steering wheel works great, and is 1 1/8 inches closer to me.  
     All in all a good thing, and I drove the car in a driving school last 
     weekend and the wheel didn't fall off.  Not that I was paranoid!!! 
     Bonus.
     
     Any advice on getting a normal horn via a contact would be 
     appreciated.
