I wanted to reply to this thread.  I had to get an auto as I damaged
both my knees in a health club! on a step machine.

Anyone successfully sued a health club please email me!

I of course recognise there is performance loss BUT it does have a =
bearing where you live.  When I used to live in London I counted 94 gear =
changes going down a high street in under a mile.  Now can that really =
make sense?

If you have traffic free roads then - its a no brainer, but the auto is =
not to be disregarded.  Why do auto drivers stick with auto?

The alternative for me was an extra $60,000 for a 968 tiptronic - =
probably the ideal, but for me the extra cost was not possible (you =
lucky 968 owners), so as with many hopefully logical solutions a =
compromise, and the 50:50 weighting and balance on the 944 auto is a =
joy. =20
