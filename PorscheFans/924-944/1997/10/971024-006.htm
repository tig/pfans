Hello Nick,

Funny you should ask. I've had both tires. I had RE71's back in 1990 on
my Buick Grand National, and SP8000 were on my 89 951 when I bought it
in the spring of 94.

Unfortunately, I can't answer the wear question. The RE 71's did last
about 40K on the Buick, but I used the SP8000 for track events, so I
wore them out in 4K miles (chunked the LF due to insufficient chamber).

For sidewall stiffness, the two tires are comparable. The RE 71 is better
in the rain, the SP8000 better in the dry. Note that the RE71 is now old
technology, it was originally designed for use on the Porsche 959! 

If you are only going to have one set of tires, Get the SP8000. If you
are going to have track wheels, and street wheels, and you drive the
car every day, get the RE71.

Either way, you can't lose, both tires are great.
