Are you talking about only 6 days of hard use? I loved the R1's at first,
probably because I got what I would call a good batch. They lasted
reasonably well on the track...Then it happened. I corded a front real quick
about 2 days. The cord was at the surface(no kidding!) but was above the
grooves. Then I heard others had similar problems. A friend went through a
set after a couple of days, ect.. We were also very good about heat cycling
them, tire presures, rotation ect. I did get a FREE replacement from BFG
after a year of bitching but the only reason they gave it to me was they
lost the tire so they couldn't argue with me about why it happened.
I am not sure what I'm going to do about driving next year but I do know
R1's will not be a part of it. I think they made a bad batch, molds were
changed, and or compounds changed...Who cares they won't be on my car
anymore and I know a lot of people feel the same way I do.
