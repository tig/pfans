Hi John & P-Fans
	Sounds like the idle stabalizer (IAC)is going bad or slow to adjust the
idle. The idle stabalizer is a motor that pumps air around the throttle plate
and into the intake manifold: to increase or decrease the base idle speed.
This valve gets built up with oily grime and also wears out and is slow to
react and sometimes sticks. This can cause what feels like the revs hanging
up w/driving or can cause the engine to stall out when the engine RPM's
return to idle.
	You should also check the Fuel pressure regulator. The regulator is located
on the rear of the fuel rail. When it starts to fail they can cause some
funny problems. Pull the vacum line off check for raw gas. you canb also
check your fuel pressure with a gauge. The regulator is $65 part and if it is
orginal part you might just take a chance and replace it as a preventative
measure.  
	I would also check for vacum leak or leaks. Look at the black rubber intake
boot. This boot will flex and move as the engine rocks back and fourth. Tale t
he boot off and check for cracks with a flash light from the inside. Also
check the intake manifold nuts for proper torque - they loosen up over time.
Take some brake cleaner and with the engine running spray around the injector
seals and any where there is a gasket along the manifold. 

					Good Luck, David Jalali

Subject: Strange problem

Had a strange problem yesterday. Got off the freeway after blasting by a
couple of orange cones(minivans) and when I pulled to the stoplight, the
car started running really rough and seemed about to die. I gave it some
gas and it was smoother, so my first thought about the balance shaft belts
went away. after a couple more lights, it seemed to smooth out and the
problem went away after a few minutes. My mechanic has no real suggestions
except to start testing things. I wrote earlier about a problem where I got
intermitent throttle surges while decelerating and the rpm's taking a long
while to fall back to idle in neutral. This only happens if the car is
restarted after being fully warmed.
Any help would be appreciated as this kept me from my autox this weekend.
