I just got around to removing the timing belt cover on my new 87 924S. I was
pleased to see that both the updated water pump and belt tensioning device
are present. The timing belt tension feels appropriate, the balance belt
tension feels too loose, but it has not slipped yet. I have some time to
figure out a few things while I replace the transmission damper before firing
up again, so I have these questions: I have read that the built in device
should not be trusted, but I am a bit skeptical of that, as I suspect that
frequent adjusting with this thing to take up any slack would be better than
no attention, which is what this one has had for the last 30k miles (I have
receipts). I have heard that one can use the device to set tension, then
approximate that tension on the balance belt by hand. This seems reasonable
since the balance belt is very loose now and still working. So, does anybody
with both the expensive tool and the built in device know what tension the
device alone applies? That would help me know how much relative tension to
put on the balance belt, and if the device should be used only for initial
setup of new belt or for regular retensioning. I also have 93k on the
original water pump which appears to be fine (though I will check the
bearings when I get the belt off) Should I replace it as preventive, or not
bother. How suddenly/severly do they fail?
