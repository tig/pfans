Now that it's getting cold and I've had the climate control worked on I'm 
wondering how the passenger compartment thermostat controls the 
temperature.  Turning the thermostat to about halfway and holding my 
hand in front of the vent, it seems like the system is "cycling".  If I turn the 
thermostat down, cool air constantly appears, all the way up, hot air 
constantly appears.   In the middle, warm air for about 5 seconds, not so 
warm air for about 5 seconds, etc.  All tests performed with the fan set to 
4, no defrost, a/c or recirculate engaged.

I was assuming that it would regulate the flow through the heater core or 
mixing box  in a linear as opposed to the binary manner.  Or does it just 
work like a house furnace?
