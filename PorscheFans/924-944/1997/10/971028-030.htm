For Bob and others whom may be interested:

There are a lot of places to get information on this topic.  Most of them
would prefer to sell you some or all of the necessary parts.  Here is some
basic info:

Truechoice (Hilliard, OH):

These folks are in the racing business, selling parts, accessories and safety
gear.  If you call Koni's racing department, they tell you to contact
Truechoice for the best technical info.  Truechoice is also their recommended
racing shock rebuilder.  

Truechoice has a nice catalog.  They sell Eibach springs, and a
coilover/perch set-up that has somewhat fine threads.  Their prices are
medium to high, and they have some knowledge about these cars.

Kelly-Moss Racing (Madison, WI)

These folks are world renowned.  David and Jeff Stone sell a lot of racing
parts to professional teams and club racers.  They were just out here at
Laguna, supporting the GT1s under contract with PMNA and Alwin Springer.  I
always talk to Jeff about suspension.  I bought their bolt-in camber plates,
upper perches and a Brey-Kraus brace for my car.  These items are somewhat
expensive.  The fellows at KMR are price leaders, but they are extremely
friendly and knowledgable.  When they use Konis, KMR has Truechoice build
'em.  They right now sell their own brand of struts, which use rebuildable
Penske shocks.  They could probably sell you springs and perches, and give
you advice.

Roger Kraus Racing (Castro Valley, CA)

Roger's son Brandon ran a successful SCCA ITS 944 car that was written up in
Excellence some time ago.  They sold the car this summer.

Roger sets up a lot of street/race, race and street cars in th Bay Area.  His
son does my alignment and corner balancing.  Anyway, Roger has about every
cataolog out there, and can sell you the required parts while advising you on
settings and fitment.  Remember, he is selling parts from catalogs, and thus
has to have some mark-up.

Bauer Porsche Repair (Oakland, CA; Lars Giersing)

Lars does a lot of set-ups for Club Racing and races 951s.  He likes to set
cars up with Carrera shocks, coil overs and springs.  He is knowledgable and
friendly.  The Carrera products are made in Georgia.  They have a nice
catalog.  Their coil over set-up is a little fancier than the typical generic
race versions sold by Ground Control (see below).  You can also orderdirectly
from Carerra.

Ground Control (Sacramento, CA)

I bought generic perches from these guys for $100.  They probably have a
variety of sizes to fit the outside diameter of your shocks.  They do a lot
of SCCA stuff, but should have experience setting up struts with pre-existent
perches.  In this case the coil over would simply rest on the bottom of the
pre-existing perch.  Then you would need to also buy standard diameter (2.5
inch) springs of a chosen rate and free length (i.e., height).  I use springs
with a free length of 10 inches.  Plus, you would need an upper perch, since
the one you have is for a much larger diameter spring.

Spring Rates:

Here is my expeience:

944 normal stock rate: 140 lbs
951 stock/M030 rate: 150 lbs.
Turbo S rate: 150-175 progressive rate
Cup car springs: 375-410 progressive rate

Recommended club racing rates (400-600; must also change rear rate!!!)

It is very important to choose spring rates wisely.  If I were going to
increase the front rate only for a street/race/AX car, I'd go no higher than
250-275.  I believe that you can decrease the resulting understeer
cost-effectively with a stiffer sway bar.  Beyond this point, I think you
have to increase the rear spring rate.  I run 450 lb front springs, with the
Turbo S (25.5 mm ) torsion bars and 200 lb helper springs on Koni/968 M030
rear coilover shocks.

Remember, all of these folks are in business and would appreciate your
patronage.

Good luck,

- MM

Mike,

Regarding your recent suspension post, I'm interested in converthing my front
Koni's to the 2-1/2 inch coil over setup.  I believe we discussed this a
number of weeks ago.  However, I don't know who to contact regarding
purchasing the required parts and/or services.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

TIA,

Bob
