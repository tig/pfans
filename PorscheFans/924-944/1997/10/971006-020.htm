First, try this to get rid of the smell in your A/C.  Buy a can of 
aerosol Lysol, make sure you like the smell.  Then, open the hood, turn 
the A/C on with the interior fan on high, then spray the can to empty 
into the air intake under the windshield.  I saw this procedure on Motor 
Week, an automotive TV program from Maryland Public Television.

The smell is caused by bacteria forming from standing water that has 
condensed from the evaporator, and the disinfectant in the Lysol will 
kill it.  You will also want to check the condensate drain tube to insure 
it is draining properly and not causing a puddle of nasty, smelly water 
to remain in your A/C.  You might have to repeat this procedure.

As far as all the problems resulting from washing your engine
compartment.. it happens whenever I wash my engine. (different symptoms,
though).  Let the car idle for a period of time until things get good and
dry.. the problems should clear up.  Moisture causes current to flow where
it is not supposed to and will give false voltages to various senders.  If
the car runs poorly, remove the distributor cap and wipe out the moisture
that may be inside.  Cover this carefully before you wash.
