Quote from the PF-FAQ on belt tensioning

"Because the cam turns at a 2/1 ratio with the crank, you must check the
flywheel for the stamped "OT". At the rear of the engine from the drivers
side just before the firewall, you can peek down and see at least one
opening atop the clutch bell housing. Inside is the flywheel which you will
see moving if you turn the engine with your left hand. Atop and through
that hole will be the letters "OT" when TDC is reached. It will be one of
the two times the cam marks align. There is also a mark at the bottom of
the flywheel under the car, that will point straight down when TDC is
reached. From TDC, turn the crank anticlockwise 1-1.5 cam teeth."

Last night when I was aligning the engine at TDC, I aligned the cam mark in
the distributor house, then looked inside the bellhousing windows for the
mark on the flywheel.  I aligned both up perfectly - BUT - my flywheel
doesn't have the letters "OT" on it.  There is just a line on the flywheel
that lines up perfectly with the bellhousing mark.  Am I 180 degrees out of
time?  Do all 944 flywheels have the letters "OT"?  I have everything torn
down but haven't pulled the belts off yet.  I want to be sure before I pull
the belts off.

TIA
