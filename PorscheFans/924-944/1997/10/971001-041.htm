Apart from a "laptop from hell" and 2 new ones in 2 weeks with no email, =
I have been able to sort all the technical problems Sept threw at me! =
For those following the sunroof issue, I have some commentary.

1. The problem I had was damaged gears for the elements that lift the =
roof.
The gears were replaced but movement sounded and looked wrong.

The answer was to pull out completely the drive cable, and re-grease =
with  a
low temperature grease.  Also there is a barrel connector that links the =
outer sleeve with the motor assembly.  Thankfully, despite a main dealer =
saying no ;  the part IS available on its own - well, Porsche never let =
us down.

The old barrel connector had been under pressure due to resistance in =
the drive cable and this was letting drive cable spill out.

The tricky bit is getting the gears in sync, if not the motor sheers one =
or both of the replacement gears very easily.  IF anyone has found a =
better way or THE way please let me know.   I  fully raised the roof, =
manually and then inserted the elements checking that the motor and =
drive is at its end stop.  IT is a very precise measure as one notch on =
the gears "off" is enough to damage the gears that have to be 100% in =
sync as the one drive cable powers them both.

The roof lining is easy and the gears low cost - replacing with the =
motor at one end of its travel seems the way - please let me know any =
better ways!
