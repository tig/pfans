Left my office tonight and had a no-start occurance ..  When starting the engine, it 
turned over a couple of times, then NOTHING !!!!  Everything worked, but no 
starter.Voltage was 12+ on the meter.. The interior light, ect, didn't dim when I 
hit the starter-- so I guess there was no current getting to it. After trying 
everthing I could think of, wiggled relays, connections, said a few kind words to 
the car, ect-- nothing... Had one of my son come get me, and tried to jump it-- 
still no starter. Gave up , went home, went to a school function, then decided to 
give it one more try !! Took my tools and floor jack so I could look at the 
connections underneath. When I got back to the office, I decided to try it one more 
time. Guess what--- it started right up. I remember having a slight problem earlier 
this summer with the same senerio, but I blamed that on leaving the key in the 
ignition ( don't really know why-- seemed logical at the time ???) 

Has ANYONE experianced this type of problem before. With these new-fangled cars 
there are SO many inter-connected circuits that I really don't know where to start. 
I guess (hope !!!) it is a corroded connection (89 S2), so I guess I'll just start 
cleaning them from the starter back.

I NEED any help I can get... Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks for any info !!!
