        I think the Lemon Files should be suggested reading for anyone who
wants to purchase a 944 and has not done any homework. The low market price
of many of these cars (4-5 K for a nice, early 944) belies the initial
price (20-25 K for an early one and 50K for later models) and the higher
than average yearly maintenance costs.  Don't compare maintanence on a
Porsche with that on a rolling home appliance like my wife's Corolla wagon.
        When I was shopping for my car, I called numerous people who were
selling 944's. Most said their car was in very good condition; many also
admitted they could not remember when they had done a major service. One
guy was proud that he took the car to Jiffy Lube for its "regular service",
but did not have any records of major service interval work. One could not
remember ever replacing belts, and said the engine "runs real rough"--read
blown balance shaft belt??  A clueless newbie could easily purchase  a
$5,000 "status" car and $5K in repair bills in short order, and piss and
moan about it to the World-Wide-Web.
        As far as the dreaded air-intake problem, I looked under my '83 NA
after reading Caleb's Porsche Page and noted that the air intake on my car
was separated from the wheel well by a large dam. I don't know how water
could breach the dam without some serious help--possibly from a broken or
damaged dam or LOTS of water.  But I henceforth worried about it.
        One of the first things that I did with my '83, prior to reading
about the watersucking problem, was drive it through a driving rainsquall
at up to 75 mph (on a deserted six-lane divided freeway, mind you) to see
how the car and the 225-50-16 Michelin XGT-V4's handled heavy rain. There
was a layer of water on the freeway and the car performed nicely up to high
speed, and did not gulp any water, from what I could tell.
        The only thing about my '83 that really frustrated me was the
infamous battery compartment corrosion problem. Seems like this should have
been designed better in the first place.  I recommend a sealed battery.
All the other problems I had to fix were reasonable things to wear out on a
high performance auto that was 13 years and 103K miles old.
