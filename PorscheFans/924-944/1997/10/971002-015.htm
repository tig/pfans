Hi Mark,

Now I don't like to speak ill of anyone, except maybe the crazy women
that ran me off the road wrecking my 951, but *some* performance shops
lie. Yes its true, where horsepower and money are concerned that the
bigger either figure the bigger the lie can be. I made enquiries at a
local turbo shop here in Auckland that has a good reputation. I was told
that I would need a new intercooler and a Motec ($$$$$$$) computer. This
would guarantee me 300 flywheel hp I was told. Neither of these mods are
necessary for anything this side of a 500hp racer. I moved on from
there. Find a shop that specializes in modifying Porsche engines and has
a lot of experience with 951s. In America it is not so hard, here in New
Zealand I found the Holy Grail and Noahs Ark before I found someone who
had real world experience modifying the 951 engine. But I digress.
The software that most of the reputable tuners in USA use is Autothority
stuff. Autothority have software for almost any configuration you wish
to run, K27, MFS, 2.8. etc. Check them out at www.autothority.com .
Their site is much better than it was a couple of months ago.
Whatever course you take get written quotes before anyone picks up a
wrench and have rear wheel dyno tests made before and after any
modifications. It is cheap insurance.
I hope this doesn't just add to the confusion.

Richard.

Has anyone done business with Turbo Performance Center in Maryland?
They are
discusing some "interesting" claims regarding a new turbo upcoming for
the 951
(within the next 6-8 weeks for dyno data).  I believe it is a modified
K-36
that will flow up to 450 horses with just the turbo and new chips (and
upgrade
to a #8 housing) needing to be installed.

How about Turbo Engineering Corporation in Golden Colorado?  I believe
that
this is the place that Chris Hanlon sent his K-27 to be re-worked.

What can be believed from these people?  Are they reputable?

I found them in Turbo and Hi-Tech Performance magazine.

Mark
