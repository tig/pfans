Having been exposed to both early and late pumps, and having seen a whole 
lot of stripped belts, I am not sure I would ever blame the pump design, though
I am sure Mrs Porsche's son did it for a reason.    Most belt death is the
result
of stripping rather than breakage, and the stripping is on the opposite side
from
where any collision might occur.   In virtually every case, there was every
reason
to believe that the car had been undermaintained.   Either the belt was
clearly set
at the wrong tension, or was contaminated with oil.   

With regard to tension breakage, I have seen several set above 10 p9201 units,
as opposed to the 2.7 that is correct.   These belts whine and are pretty
tight, but
I doubt if the tensioner is capable of breaking them by itself.    Proper
tension is 
that which just gets the slack out of the belt.   As soon as the belt starts
to stretch
it is too tight.   While Porsche makes a big deal of the p9201 tool, Porsche
belt 
tightness is not inconsistent with the rest of the industry.   You would not
believe
the procedure for setting belt tension on a Nissan, for example.   Porsche
at least
went to the trouble of making a pretty bulletproof tool, expensive though it
may be.
