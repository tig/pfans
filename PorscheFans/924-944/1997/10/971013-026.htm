Jim: this ghost has a brother who is a resident of my sunroof for 2
years now. While he still lives there, I have gone through several
painful steps that did not persuade him to evict, so here is what you
can skip:

1. New sunroof switch -- did nothing except look new.
2. New relays (2) at the motor (in left luggage compartment) -- did
nothing.
3. Adjusting motor triggers set by plastic worm gear -- this changes the
cutoff for on/off, which may save your sunroof gears but does not fix
said problem. These microswitches are under the twin relays mentioned in
2.
4. New roof microswitch actuated by sunroof tongue -- does nothing.
5. Reversing switch polarity, tracing wiring -- nothing.

The only thing I have not done yet, is replace the sunroof relay (on a
clip in the driver-side footwell next to the stereo). I will do this
next week, will let you know what happens. My temporary solution has
been to take the plastic cover off the roof microswitch (extremely
delicate operation -- easy to break) so the sunroof tongue does not hit
the switch. Since the motor thinks the roof is not on the car, it does
not do anything. When I want to operate the roof I stick a finger
skyward and depress the roof microswitch and simultaneously use the
sunroof switch to lower/raise. While this means the sunroof ghost does
not send the roof up as soon as I start moving the car, it also means
lowering the roof unlocks it. I have to lock the roof by pressing the
roof microswitch, craning my neck 180 degrees to look at the arms and
hitting the sunroof switch up and down for milliseconds at a time until
the roof is locked but not raised.

One popular misconception that I did unlearn was the notion that the
roof microswitch controls safety functions. Whatever clues the sunroof
motor in about the car's speed, it is not the roof microswitch (at least
on an '84 roof). Safety functions are being controlled elsewhere and
that is the component that has gone south on my car and yours. Needless
to say it is extremely dangerous to risk driving with an unlocked roof
so you may not want to try my temporary fix, and after 85.5 both the
sunroof motor and relays/switches changed, so you may be better advised
to take your 944 to a dealer. Just make sure none of the components I
listed above are blamed because they are unlikely to cause the problem.
Good luck.
