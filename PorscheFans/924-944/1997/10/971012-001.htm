From what I have seen and experienced in the wonderful world of Porsche
is the only people you are likely to meet who are snobs or otherwise
undesirable are those people who pull up in something with a prancing
horse on the front. ALL of the Porsche people I have meet have been
nothing but friendly open and honest. It doesn't matter if your car is
old or new. One guy even handed me the keys to his 951 and said to take
it round the block to see if I liked the suspension setup he was running
after talking to him about it. He was running 250 lb springs, 2 way
konis with a 30mm bar and M030 bushes if anyone was wondering. It made a
nice fast road car.
