Hey,

Last week I got to drive my 951 up to Atlanta for business, so I decided =
to drop by my friendly Porsche dealer for some nit-noid parts - oil =
filters, etc.  One thing I wanted to get was the 'proper' motor mount =
bolts.  For those of you who haven't done the motor mount update, the =
new (turbo) mounts require a slightly longer bolt because the shoulders =
of the mounts are a little thicker.  I ended up using a thinner washer =
than stock to make the length right with the only bolts I could find.  I =
planned to go back on my next oil change and swap out the bolts with the =
proper bolts and washers - just to make me feel good.  It isn't that =
hard to do with the mounts in place and I like working in small places.  =
Must use the proper Porsche parts, you know.

Well I ask the parts guy for some motor mount bolts for a '87 951.  He =
comes back with two.  I say "No, I need four for both mounts'.  He =
responds, suprised - "You replaced BOTH mounts ?".

Now I start thinking, who in the hell would go through the trouble of =
supporting the motor, unbolting the a-arms, unbolting BOTH motor mounts, =
unbolting the rack&pinion assembly, dropping the cross member, and then =
fineagling the mounts in and out for a couple of hours to remove only =
ONE of the mounts.  I guess from his response this is a common =
occurance.  I also assume even some shops would do this, if the customer =
wanted to save the price of a mount.   Talk about false economy.  If I =
didn't have the $80 for the second mount, then I don't think I'd be =
driving - anything. =20

Oh, BTW, the new motor mount bolts use a heavy, shouldered bolt head =
with no washer unlike the originals with the *thick* washer.

But this kind of insanity happens all the time.  Example - I take my =
Honda CRX in for it's timing belt service at 75K.  Honda shop does a =
good job (apparently).  At about 80K I decide it's time for new plugs.  =
I pull out first spark plug connector.  Motor oil slings off of =
connector.  Every spark plug hole is full of motor oil.  Quickly remove =
valve cover.  Dealer had installed new perimeter gasket, but not the =
spark plug hole gaskets.  Go to dealer.  "Why would anybody replace part =
of a gasket set?".  Response "Those spark plug donut gasket don't =
usually go bad until 90K miles".  I get 4 donut gaskets at a total cost =
of $8.00.  (This same dealer's parts department just informed me that =
Honda struts never go bad - geeze!)

I guess I'll just replace only one of my shocks when it start =
leaking....

Some things I just don't understand.

Done with my flame for the year.  I feel better now.
