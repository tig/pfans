In a message dated 97-10-07 02:30:49 EDT, you write:

<< Sorry to flame; I just couldn't help myself :-/
  a fool to anyone. 
 
 Uh-oh... funny how it worked out that way.  And you didn't even have the
 sense to quit when you had the chance.  Oh well...
 
 What on earth are you trying to do?
 
  This is no surprise at all - the string "porschephiles@tta.com" isn't
 quite the right format for a hostname - is it?  Since when has nslookup
 been any way to fully verify an email address?  *sheesh*
 
 Yes, no kidding.  The name server has an address too.  We knew that from
 your first "techno" extravaganza.
 
 
 Erm... hello?  It does nothing of the sort.  You should learn how to use
 whois/nslookup/dig correctly.  I mean, do you even know what an MX record
 is?  Incidentally, I tried the below using ns1.starnet.net initially but
 it was dead - a pretty good sign I'd say.
 
 So there you go.  porschephiles@tta.com is still a valid email address.
 There is no way to confirm that the list still operates without writing
 email to that address.  I think if I were attempting to write an
 informative and helpful article for the Porsche community with a strict
 deadline, that would be all the verification I would do - and all the
 information points to a high probability that the list still exists.
 
 
 And what an impressive company it is too - I presume you work there as an
 accountant or something equally technical in nature?  Oh no - wait, I see
 you call yourself a "Network Engineer".  Qualifications required to gain
 employment with that title must be free in cereal boxes these days.

Excuse me, but I find this type of exchange extremely unprofessional and
offensive.  I thought the purpose of this list was to exchange information
regarding our common ground . . . . . (ie. Porsche automobiles).  If the
purpose is to see how much we can insult one another then maybe we're on the
wrong list.

There are lots of acceptable ways to correct someone without resorting to
this type of verbal abuse.  And, yes, you could've helped yourself!

Sorry for the BW.
