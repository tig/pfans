Hey all 
I've read the digest and enjoyed thouroughly for three months now and
this is my first post.   I'm 17 and I've owned an early 85' for a year,
or at least I think it's an 85 .  The VIN checks out at an 85 but the
title says 84'.  And yes I paid for the car.  I believe I am at least
the 4th owner so I have no previous maintenance records on the car.  The
car was a nightmare when I bought it but I got it cheap.  I've since
replaced the compressor, installed a turbo look nose/spoiler on the
front, put on one of those throttle response cams, and the little light
that says porsche on the back (which answers many people who ask what
kind of car is that). 
	
Questions
1.	I've got a problem whenever I put the car in gear it jerks and shakes
violently.
I moves but barely.  I bought a clutch kit that I have yet to put on,
but after reading some posts I wounder if it could be the differential. 
I haven't moved it for a week.
2.  Can those dashboard be recoveded? I hate those plasticcoverlays
3   How do I find about my local PCA chapter?
4.  Who do you call to get a copy of the original window sticker?
