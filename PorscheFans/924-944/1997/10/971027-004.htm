From: "Joe  Mitchell " <eyecare1@datastar.net>

I am getting ready to replace all the front suspension bushings, front
shocks, and all the rubber. My question is Do I need to replace the
springs? Let me give you a little more info. I was listening in on the 
928
channel and someone posted the following in response to a 928 question
:

"(Tom wrote:)
My car's an '83 and I need to replace my front shocks soon.  I'm gonna 
go
with the Konis.

'Do not use the Konis with your existing springs if the old ones have 
been
leaking for a while or have leaked out. Because you have been riding 
on the

springs and you will be in the market for new Konis sooner if you 
leave in
the old springs.'"

Joe,

Tom's mechanic is a moron.  He is telling him wive's tales.  Spring 
rate has absolutely NOTHING to do with age or load placed on it at 
some point in its life, unless it is affected by physical damage or 
deformation.

Poorly designed springs can sag from loading after many years.  If 
you'll notice, one usually sees this happening on old stationwagons 
and Ford Granadas.  I don't think I've seen any P cars dragging their 
bumpers lately.

If you think about it, the shock is just a damper.  As such, it 
doesn't do anything to help support the car or prevent spring wear.  

HTH
Dave
