Daer P-Fans
	Just my 0.02 cents worths on car storage.  When putting your car into
storage - NEVER wash it and then put a car cover over the car! The moister
from washing the car will be trapped by the cover. If you wash the car wait a
week or so before installing the car cover - let the moister evaporate! If
you will storing your car outside, spead out a layer or two of plastic on the
ground and then park the car over the plastic. This will prevent the ,
moister in the ground from eating the floor & body of the car. Disconnect the
battery, or use a trickle charger if you will be driving the car every few
weeks.
	 If the car will be parked for months on end. Support the car with four jack
stands, so that the tires do not touch the ground. Remove the spark plugs and
fill the cylinders 3/4's with ATF or a light grade engine oil. Remove the
car's battery from the car. Use a gasoline stabalizer so that the gas does
not break down into a gummy residue. Keep the car out of direct sunlight and
in a low humidity. 

						Good Luck, David jalali

The best thing you can do for any car during the winter is drive it if 
possible.  Keeping things moving and heated keeps rubber supple, metal 
coated with oil where it needs to be, grease distributed, and moisture away.

Changing all fluids, clean and dry car inside and out, then driving the
car once a week should keep it healthy.  Do it for 15 minutes or at least
5 miles to burn off any accumulated moisture in the crankcase.  Don't
forget to run the A/C once a month for 5 minutes to keep the compressor's
seals from drying out.  Otherwise they will shrink and allow your precious
freon to leak.  If the car is located outside, get a good quality car
cover to keep it clean and dry.  Wash car well before putting the cover
on.
