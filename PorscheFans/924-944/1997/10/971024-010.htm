<<As a proud owner of a I.G. 'Timmins' red toweye, I must warn 
everybody; that at the track, everyone will leave the Boxsters, 
911 turbos and other mundane vehicles and gather around admiring 
your car and it's toweye. So if being the center of attention is a 
bit much, don't have yours painted.>>

Wow, people in your region must not get out too often. Around here it
takes a 993TT or a 911 GT2 car or a brand new Caterham Super 7 to evoke
much notice.

As a downside to these tow eyes that are left in place all the time, I
wonder what kind of damage it would cause to the lucky car in front in
the event of a 5-10 mph collision?

I also wonder how many people have their bumpers pulled off or bent when
it is used improperly?
