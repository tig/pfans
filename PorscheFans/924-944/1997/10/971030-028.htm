	Came out of the office today to find the shifter on my 87 944S had
separated from the linkage.  It has been exhibiting a bit of side to side
play lately, but I do not recall subjecting it to any trauma when I pulled
in.  In any case, I pulled up the shifter outer boot assembly from the
console and could feel (could not see) that the shifter has a rod which
apparently was meant to fit in a hole in the linkage. I was able to pull up
the linkage and insert the shifter (working by feel through the inner
leather boot) and everything seems fine.  I don't believe in poltergeists,
so I assume this will re-occur unless a more thorough repair is
accomplished.  Suggestions and comments?
