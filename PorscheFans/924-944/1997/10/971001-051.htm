P-fans:

I posted a couple of days ago about new engine vibration in my 92 968 coupe
and my suspicion that I again had a problem with the balance shafts/belts.  I
had had a previous problem in June when my belt had 4 teeth sheared off,
causing substantial roughness at 4k rpm and up.  The belt was replaced at the
dealer at that time.

I brought the car back in today.  The mechanic found the balance belt to be
loose, and one of the sprockets had shifted on the belt by 2 teeth.  The belt
itself (a $100 part) was in good shape.  He reset the shafts and tightened
the belt.  There were no problems with the shafts or rollers.  The car is now
smooth at all rpms.

Moral:  even though the mechanic and service writer never mentioned it, the
balance belt on a 968 needs to be retensioned at about 1500 miles, just like
the cam belt.  And if the motor develops a new vibration at 4k rpm and above,
even if the belt has been checked or changed recently, it would be worthwhile
checking it again.
