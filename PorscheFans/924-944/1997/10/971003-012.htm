The 10 speaker system as comes standard on the '89 944 turbo S consists of
the following:

2 tweeters with flush mounted grills located in the front door panels just
above the window switch bezel.

2 midranges, 2 mid-woofers located in the area that normally is the area
behind the door pocket.  The grills for these speakers fill in the space
between the arm rest and the bottom of the door pockets.  Mounted in these
speakers is a crossover that controls the above mentioned tweeter.

2 midranges, 2 woofers located in the traditional speaker area under the rear
quarter window. There is a special grill that covers these speakers similar
to the door panel grills. 

The amp for this system is actually a graphic equalizer that is mounted in
the console pocket under the radio. The radio is a Blau Reno w/cassette. 

All the '88 turbo S' I have seen do not have the equalizer/amp and are just
powered by the Blau Reno. (very lame sounding due to lack of power)

The connection between the Reno and the EQ is a weird DIN plug. Most Reno's I
have seen have the correct output recepticle for this amp. Maybe it was an
option in '88.

By the way, I have two complete systems with door panels for sale. One is the
correct Burgundy with plaid from my 88 S racecar (Seats also avalible) the
other is from a 89 S and is black.
