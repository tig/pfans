        Having recently owned a 944 and now driving a 951, I have to agree
with Dan Webb that the 944 is a very nice around-town car.  The 951 never
seems happy in town.  I also found the 944 was a more drivable car on the
twisties (this is where I peg the Porsche fun-meter) because of the more
linear acceleration. But is that because I have yet to learn how to drive
the 951, or do others besides Dan and I think this is the case?
        Having said that, the 951 is a hell of a lot of fun to drive, and I
have been experimenting with how to drive the twisties and how best to kick
in the afterburners as I drive hard though the apex of the turns. The car
is rock-steady though the turns but I have not yet gotten it up to the
maximum speed that I had taken my old 944 in my "lab", which is a very
twisty stretch of ocean road along Oahu's eastern coast (hopefully no one
from the H.P.D. is on this list). I am still worried on what to do with the
sudden boost as I take the sharp curves. Any comments from those who
actually know how to drive the 951?  Practice, practice, practice??

Aloha,
