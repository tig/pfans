Subject: rear ride height


I heard somewhere that the rear ride height is adjustable on a 944.  
Anyone
have any ideas on how to adjust it, my 944 seems to ride a little 
higher in
the rear than some of the others I have seen around my town.  as 
always, any
help will be appreciated.
==========================================================

When you take the wheel off, you'll see two big bolts on the 
positioning arm that extends from the front of the wheelwell to the 
trailing arm and hub.  The front one just tightens to hold the whole 
thing together, and the rear one is an eccentric that can be turned to 
adjust ride height within about a 1" range.  Loosen the front one, 
then turn the rear once loosened.  The torsion bar will force the arm 
to extend; just turn it down with a big 1/2" drive socket and 
extension.

The inside nut is hard to get at.  I got a flat Park hex wrench from 
my local bike shop to get to it.  I can't remember the size, someone 
on list probably knows.  I think it's 32 mm.

If you are not able to adjust as far as you want, but don't want to go 
the torsion bar adjustment route (have to drop whole rear end), you 
can grind some of metal away on bottom of eccentric bolt hole to get 
another 1/2 to 1 inch of adjustment.  I know it sounds like bad 
practice, but I've seen a factory mechanic do it.  It's lots cheaper
 than pulling the torsion bars...
