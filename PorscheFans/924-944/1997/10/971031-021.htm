Subject: air/fuel ratio meter

All,

I've seen air/fuel ratio meters that operate using the signal from the Oxygen
sensor.  Has anyone ever had any experience w/ such a gauge??  My mechanic
(and good friend of mine) were discussing this, and his concern was that it
may corrupt the signal to the DME due to a change in the circuits resistance.
It would be really great to be able to monitor fuel/air ratio to assure the
mixture is not running to lean.  My engine has 145k miles on it now, and
paranoia is mounting.

Hello Bob
	I have used a air/fuel ratio meter on my 951 with no problems encountered!
The DME works fine with meter hooked up. I used a "RSR Meter" from "RB
Racing". I looked around for their phone number but I can not find it. The
meter hooks up to the O2 sensor. The meter is purely a volt meter with LED's.
We're talking minute voltages - less than 1.5 Volts. What you have to realize
is that the info that the meter is giving you, is a rough guide to the real
air/fuel ratio. You can not use this info to - say program your new "tech II"
or "motec" systems. These meters give you a "rough" idea of the mixture. For
a more precise "meter" you need a more expensive meter (AutoThority has one
they paid $10K! A Horoba - spelling?) to fine tune a special chips on the
dyno. The "RSR" Meter works well. 
	Lots of places recommend a adjustable fuel pressure regulator. So a friend
of mine told me that the BMW f-reg off a E-30, '86-'92 325i's would give me
more HP. I put the regulator on, it felt like more HP at full throttle, but
part throttle - was terrible! I was able to tell that the 3 Bar fuel pressure
regulator that I installed on my 951, really did provide too much fuel all
the time! At part throttle AND at WOT. So I took the regulator off. 
	RB Racing is located in CA, Irvine I think? It cost about $140. The Meter is
called a "RSR" air/fuel ratio meter. RB Racing makes turbo kits for motor
cycles and programable fuel injection systems. They specialize in land speed
bike stuff. 

									
PS: An Exhaust Pyrometer is also a good idea if you want to know how close to
'melt down" your engine is. 

									Good Luck, David Jalali
