I am looking for advice from folks who use their 944 during the winter. Up 
here in Vermont, we have snow and ice on the roads in the winter. As such, the 
local road crews salt the roads, and occasionally spread sand on really icy 
days.  Why do I ask about this? My wife and I own an '87 Jeep cherokee that we 
drive in the winter, we are considering selling the Jeep and trying to find a 
cosmetically challenged (ie. cheap) 944 for winter use. I really don't want to 
use our '85.5 944 in the winter since they salt the roads in this area and it 
is rust free top, bottom, inside and out. Any suggestions? What tires do you 
use? Since the 944 has a close to 50/50 weight balance, does it handles fairly 
well in the snow with the correct tires? My wife and I got hit by a snow storm 
last fall with 225/50-15 summer tires on the vehicle while driving on the 
highway. I was able to control it fairly well, thought it was kind of fun, 
sure did get some funny looks though.

  I have almost solved my front end shimmy problem, new tires are on the way 
to replace the defective Pirelli P700Z's I currently have on the front. I 
suspected they were defective, the Porsche dealer confirmed this on Monday 
when they re-balanced the wheels for free as their first balance job was not 
done correctly. I will be writing a piece on Front End shimmy sometime soon, 
with input from folks on this list, I hope we can turn it into something that 
can be added to the FAQ.

TIA,
    Ezra
