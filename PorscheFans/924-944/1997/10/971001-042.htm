Dear P fans

A cry for heeellp.

Not sure if this made the list on Tues so I'll try a repost: I looked at
the hatch problem I reported to the list last night (will not stay closed)
and have a few questions.

Is the center swivel mechanism by the key lock fairly loose, no real
tension and easily turnable by hand?

Do the two holes in the long oval shaped plate that turns with the key,
supposed to locate anything?

Is my lack of latching ability maybe due to minor alignment problems in the
box that received the male post or is due to some failure?

What tool fits the star shaped screws that hold the cover to the male post
on the hatch lid ('87 944)?  While trying to adjust a frozen one I have
just snapped on off. Now it definitely will not latch! Does not have the
simple Philips head that appears in the Haynes illustration.

Thanks for any help coming
maurice
