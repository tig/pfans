------------------------------

Yeah, the later turbo is a K26-2660 G4.10 as opposed to a G6.10, if I 
remember correctly.  Like Russ said, the turbine is smaller.  The 
bypass and compressor side are supposed to be the same.

I'm almost positive the bellhousing are the same dimensionally, but if 
not you could get a spacer machined for it.  I was thinking though, 
what about the hydraulic clutch?  Does it utilize a different throw 
out fork or attachment method?  I haven't looked, but I think the fork 
for hydraulic is on the bottom, not the top, and the slave goes 
through this hole on the bottom of housing with an inspection hole 
next to it. 

If the 80's don't have hydraulic clutches (I thought they didn't), you 
would also need a master, slave, that weird spring on the back of the 
clutch pedal, and a brake master cylinder reservoir with fluid feed 
for the clutch.

Oh, also if you don't have the flywheel sensor and cable, I have an 
extra one that is good.  Don't ask why...
