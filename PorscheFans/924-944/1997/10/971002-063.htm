Hello All,

I've been experiencing a relatively infrequent problem with shifting
into 2nd gear on my 85.5 944 which has me a little concerned.

Every so often--maybe once every week or two--when shifting from first
gear into second and depressing the clutch all the way to the floor, the
gears will sputter/grind as if I did not have the clutch fully engaged.
The problem was more frequent before I changed the transmission fluid
and added some Slick 50, but it still happens occastionally--mostly when
the car is relatively cool. When I have been doing a lot of driving and
the car is warm, shifting is smoother and the problem does not occur.

Does it sound to you mechanically knowledgable folks that I need a new
clutch? I am afraid that it might be worse--like 2nd gear has some
broken teeth or something. Could a shaking engine that needs new mounts
cause this?

Also: I've been experiencing a little engine knock  every so often when
I turn off the car. This weekend, I am planning on replacing the spark
plugs (I was recommended NGKs), ignition wires (Magnecor--very durable
and comparatively inexpensive), distributor cap and rotor (both Bosch).
Should I expect this to take care of the knocking, or is there something
else I should look for? Bad idle valve maybe?

I would appreciate any advice.

-NEIL
