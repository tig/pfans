I bought a 1987 924S a week or two ago. I've been happily driving around
and filling it up with 87 octane (R+M/2) gasoline in accordance with the
owner's manual. Then I noticed a little sticker on the dashboard which
reads:

"Warning: Use 92 or higher octane fuel only. A.P.E. Chip Equipped!"

Hmmmm... this is not something I bargained for. How can I tell if this car
has had a non-OEM chip installed? Where exactly do I look, and what am I
looking for? If it has been chipped, does the A.P.E. sticker refer to 92
octane measured by the R+M/2 method, or one of the European methods (which
would equate to 87 octane R+M/2)? And finally, where can I find information
about the A.P.E. chip(s) and get an idea what effect this particular chip
might have on my car (I'm familiar with the more general discussion of
chips in the FAQ).

Thanks in advance for your responses.

- James
