Since people are relating their experiences...

Zims -- I've ordered about two dozen times from this place, with two
small problems.  They sent me the wrong temperature thermostat (it
was marked 87, the order indicated 80), and they sent a package to
my old address after I had given them my new address during a previous
order.  They offered to re-send the package if I couldn't recover it.
They seem knowledgeable and friendly, are willing to look up part numbers
for you, and don't rush you.  During the UPS strike, they sent my package
through the USPS with no delays.  There have only been one or two times
when I didn't get the package on the next day after my order.  Currently
my favorite place to get parts.

Carlsen -- Ordered about four times from this place with mixed results.
They seem to want to rush your order when you're on the phone.  They
gave me a good price on the P9201 belt tension tool about two years
ago -- $389.  When I asked the salesman about the parts that come with
the updated water pump, he muffled the phone and yelled to someone else,
"hey, what are the damn parts for the updated pump". I waited two weeks
for a re-built water pump, called several times and got the run-around,
and then I finally cancelled the order.  They promptly credited my credit
card order with no hassles.  I once received a package with a note inside
that had someone else's credit card information scribbled on it.  Another
time I ordered a flywheel lock for the pre 85.5 car and I didn't know the
part number, and they sent me two different kinds of flywheel locks, and
told me to send them back the wrong one (one of them did fit).

Automotion -- Ordered three or four times.  Have always received excellent
service and delivery.  Prices seem a little higher compared to most other
places.  I ordered an ill-fitting engine service cover that doesn't seem to
want to stay on the car (it looked like it fit a lot better in their picture).

Stoddards -- Ordered once, gave them a lengthy list of small parts with no
problems getting them.  They seem friendly on the phone, and don't rush you.

Local Porsche dealer in Austin, TX -- I stay away unless I have to get parts
fast and they have them in stock.  I ordered hood shocks that turned out to
be almost four times as expensive as what I later found at some mail-order
places.  Prices are outrageously high, even for filters.  I once bought an
oil filter that had some surface rust on the inside.  I haven't visited them
since they went under new management.
