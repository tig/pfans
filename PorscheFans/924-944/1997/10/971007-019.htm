Allllrighty then.  I have horns again.  Thanks to everyone who provided 
input on figuring out my problem.  In the end, it was trivial.  It turns out 
that the grease on the end of the horn contact from my new (used) OEM 
steering wheel was NOT dielectric.  Last time I pulled the wheel for 
something else, I just scraped it with my fingernail.  A couple days later, 
when someone was drifting into my lane, I thumbed the button out of 
reflex and what do you know, sound came out.  Everyone must have 
thought I just got married as I drove down the road tooting the horn 
repeatedly to hear how it sounds.  

Now I can pull the twin air horns mounted under the windshield washer 
reservoir.  Although, I can almost understand why PO mounted them.  
The OEM seem pretty weak compared to the "bright" note put out by the 
air horns.
