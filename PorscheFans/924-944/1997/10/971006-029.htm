Dana,
     Have you ever been shopping in a grocery store and seen a parent being 
incredibly mean to their child? Well, you don't have to be someone special, 
friendly, or nice to be a parent, nor do you need to be in order to buy a 
Porsche. We are fortunate on this group to have a great bunch of Porsche 
fanatics to help each other out and share experiences. I have found most 
Porsche drivers I pass on the road or meet to be friendly, and usually 
exchange a toot of the horn or a friendly wave. I attend local PCA events on 
every occasion possible. As part of these events, we often go on a drive 
through the countryside of Vermont, an instant way to gain a 911 driver's 
respect as you gain a lead on them in curvey sections (ok, driving skills 
vary, but it sure is nice to have owners of newer 911's making comments such 
as: "WOW, your car really moves"..)   If you haven't already, join your local 
PCA chapter, go to some events, meet some other folks with Porsches, you will 
find many friendly 911, 924,944,356,etc.. owners out there... Yes there are 
some snobs, but for the most part, I have found other Porsche owners to be 
very friendly. Perhaps you will even enlighten a few 911 owners as to how well 
944&951's perform.

Good Luck, don't give up on waving to other Porsche drivers..
 Ezra

P.S. I also had a chance to meet a couple that just bought their first 
Porsche, a silver Boxster, sure does look better in person than in the 
photos...
