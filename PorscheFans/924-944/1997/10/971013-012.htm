Greetings, P-fans.
        Yesterday, some *&^%$$#@ backed into my car while we were shopping.
I only later discovered the damage after I got home and noticed the
right-rear plastic wrap-around piece on the bumper was bowed out. On
inspection, I also noticed that the collapsible tube-within-a-tube mount on
the right side was pushed in about 1-2 cm relative to the left mount,
causing the plastic trim to hit the rear panel and bowing it.
        Can these tube mounts be pulled out or must they be replaced? If
they must be replaced, is it straightforward to remove it and replace it,
and does anyone know who (besides PCNA) sells the parts? I looked in the
Haynes repair book last night but it was rather tearse as far as info is
concerned.
