Subject: WTB 924 LSD

Anyone know if there is/was a limited slip differential (oem or aftermarket)
available for the 5 speed normally aspirated 924(not 924S) and where I can
get one? I've heard there might be one for the 924 Turbo, anyone know if
it'll fit? 
TIA

Hello Craig & P-Fans
	The LSD has friction disc's that do wear - I been told ( by Mark a tech
@AutoThority) if you like spinning the rear wheels in a turn  - it is not
unusal for the disc's to only last a few years! If you are looking for a LSD
with zero maintanece go for a "QUAIFE" available from AutoTech $1600,
800-553-1055. I had a Porsche ZF Limited slip installed in my '86 951 when my
second gear/main shaft - develloped a chip and exploded! I understand that
this is common for the early 951's. The Turbo S's & S-2's have a hardend 2nd
gear/mainshaft. The LDS friction disc's cost around $35 each, you will need
two. 
	The first thing I would do to your S-2 would be to replace the hydro-chain
tensioner inside of the cylinder head. The tensioner has a trend to not keep
tension and then all the valves will be bent! The tensioner cost around $300
and will save you thousands of dollars in the long run. I have seen the
tensioner fail as low as 40K miles (but most failures are around 50K
Mileage). To be safe I would always replace the tensioner every 45K miles
when replacing the belts (cam & t-belts)!
	As far as a revy engine - get a chip! A chip will definitly perk up
performance! 

						Good Luck, David Jalali
