Hi Maurice and Kevin,
Your arguments sound plausible, but I think there is one fatal error: the
pivot point is not the caliper since that is fixed to the axle and
counteracted by that, it is, I believe in fact, the point of contact of the
tire with the road surface.  Think of it this way: if the caliper were
replaced by a bolt (i.e. the axle locked and unable to turn) if you tried
to push the car the point of resistance (pivot point) would be the contact
of the tire with the road.  It wouldn't matter whether you bolted the
caliper or put a pin through the axle.  It is the same with the rear
wheels. Thus it really makes no difference where you put the calipers, or
even if you use drum brakes, the car dives because the rear is raised up,
transferring weight forward to compress the front springs because the
center of mass is above the tire patch.  By your argument, if you put the
caliper as high as possible and lowered the center of mass of the car below
it, the rear of the car would move down, not up.  This is clearly not going
to happen.  There may be some other reasons for placement of the calipers,
but is should have very little effect on the nose dive.
