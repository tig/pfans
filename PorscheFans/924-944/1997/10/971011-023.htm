Greetings Cabriolet Owners,

I picked up a useful publication at a recent swap meet; Porsche's
Service Information Technik (WKD 495 721) for the 944 S2 Cabriolet for
89/90.  It's 65 pages and includes information on the body
construction, convertible top adjustment and drive mechanism, and
electrical controls (including a legible wiring diagram!)

There's a cool set of diagrams showing the coupe and cabriolet
body with a description of the cabriolet production procedure,
and diagrams showing where the cabriolet received additional
bracing: an added brace in the ouside of the wheel house corner,
additional braces between the the hinge pillars and sides, a
reinforcement plate on the inside of the windshield frame sides.
The second floorpan has an x-shaped brace in its center, and there
is an additional brace near the control arm pickup.  Another reinforcement
plat is welded at the rear of the door sill.

The famous vibration damper - that long black cylinder suspended on
rubber mounts in the right rear wheel well - "considerably reduces
body vibration occurring while driving the car with a lowered
convertible top on rough roads."

Awhile back, someone asked:

Q: DO I REALLY HAVE TO PUT ON THE TOP COVER WHENEVER I DROP THE TOP?

"Driving the car with a lowered top, but without the top cover, is approved.
However, to avoid dirt and other damaging environmental influence on the
inside of the convertible top, the top cover should always be used
at least then when the top is not left open for only a short time."
(Sorry - the last sentence IS as printed - you figure it out.)

I've seen a race-prepped 90 Cabrio running with the top down and no
cover - so it's apparently ok even at high speed.

The booklet has instruction for adjusting the operation of the top,
and of the door windows, as well as informative diagrams on the top
and its various bows and cables.  Detailed descriptions of the drive
mechanism, location of motors and relays and it's adjustment are included.

All-told, very informative.

Todd Leen, 90 944S2 Cab.
