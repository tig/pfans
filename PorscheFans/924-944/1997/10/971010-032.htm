I'm at the point where I need to replace the exhaust (cat-back, it's all
pretty shot) on my wife's '77 924. I'd like to have a system built from a
street/track muffler (probably Walker Super Turbo) and custom-bent
tubing for budget performance. Now, a list member mentioned to me that
the hot setup was to have a header leading back to a 2.25" dia pipe, with
only one perf. muffler/resonator at the tip. However, I have a couple
of questions about applying this to my setup, due to some deviations
from the ideal setup at my end.

I have a stock setup, and I'd be replacing only the exhaust behind the cat.
Would switching to the larger 2.25"  pipe cause me to lose a substantial
amount of torque due to drop of backpressure? Would I only be able to
see gains at high engine speeds? The car is an automatic, so it'd be
pretty useless in this case. Also, what about changing the length of the
exhaust to tune to the engine (increasing HP through scavenging)?  Is
this something I need to worry about?

Any advice and explanations about exhausts would be appreciated - I
know just enough to cause myself concern/get myself in trouble ;)

TIA
