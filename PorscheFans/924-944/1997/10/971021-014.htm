Greg --

Couldn't figure out your e-mail address, so I'll be offensive on the server
too. I'd like a cupholder to replace the stupid cassette holder between the
seats. Don't like leaving my tapes out of the boxes. And a cupholder would
beat getting coffee on the floormats.  But I don't think a cupholder on the
door would be cool at the track. Let me know if you find any alternatives.
