Speedvision will air stuff, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 1:30 to 6:00 and
re-air/play at starting at 7:00.  All times are eastern and PM. What
class is he running? If it is not between 1:30 and 6:00 it won't make it
to air. For those with their own dish, it is on Satcom C4 transponder 11,
audio on 6.2 and 6.8.

if he does run during that time. E-mail me back at gwns as well as this
one. I go in at 12:30 to assist in master control. Back in on Sunday for
the same just in at 7:00 am,
