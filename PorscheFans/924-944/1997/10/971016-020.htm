Some interesting problems on my 85.5 944:

Periodic low idle speed, to the point of engine stalling.
Seems to be worst in hot weather.  Occasionaly a problem on cold 
start, more often on hot start in hot weather.

When idle speed is low, economy gauge (the MPG gadget that I'm 
guessing is an indicator of mixture) pulses up and down.

Failed emission inspection (CO too high).

(Really intersting thing) -- In testing the car, I discovered that 
the DME is from a Turbo!

I've had the car for three years, and it has passed the emission 
inspection before.

Following the Chilton manual, I've:

Checked ground and sensor plugs for connections.
Checked DME for power.
Checked resistance on air flow sensor (in spec -- for a Turbo!)
for both mass sensor and air temperature sensor.
Checked  Engine temp sensor for cold resistance (haven't checked 
sensor while hot.)
Checked throttle switch.

Any ideas about what to check next?  I will probably replace the DME 
as I can, but since I've passed emissions before, and since the rough 
idle is new (about four months old), I'm not sure that this is the 
only problem.

Thanks in advance for suggestions!
