Oh oh. Better get ready to defend myself :-)

I have the option, just looked at the wheel with the trusty tape measure,
and indeed it is 380mm outside diameter as Kevin's FAQ states. The only
reference to size of the regular wheel I've been able to find is in the
Christophorus issue that "tested" the 924S and it states the stock diameter
is 380mm, with the sport option being 363mm. I'm not sure if the 363mm
option (small 4-spoke design) was available in the U.S.

I used the term "slightly smaller" in the web site because that's what the
dealer told me when I purchased my car. I also had the opportunity to sit
in 924S' with and without the option before purchasing and the wheel
certainly felt slightly smaller in diameter, though thicker.

Neither wheel is small enough to let you use a 13" wheel in any case, and I
doubt anyone will question you about a 14" one.
