As a current owner of a 88 944 turbo, I've dropped more than a few 
dollars into repairing some of the failure modes indicative of this car but 
consider it money well-spent.  It seems to me that we sometimes forget 
that every car is a compromise.  

If you buy a Yugo, you want an engine that goes a 1,000,000 miles w/out 
major failures.  If you buy a dragster, you want an engine that survives 1 
run.  

Since I have a car with 8 inch alloy wheels and 45 series tires, I expect to 
spend more money and frustration on getting them balanced. Same thing 
when I have an electrical problem with 8-way power seats.  Even better, I 
can't drive down the street without hanging onto the steering wheel 
because tramlining will put me in the next lane on a bumpy road.

When I think about the hassles I have with this car, I think back to my 
brother's "built" 351W.  It was great stock but when once built, became a 
tinker toy.  Drive, tinker, drive, tinker.  We just had someone build it first 
:-).

Anyway, while I don't feel the same way about my watercooler, I think 
your site here is an important source of information for potential buyers.  
I'd be the first one to agree that this is not a beater car.  One misleading 
factor is the undervalued nature of this product line which makes people 
compare it to other <$10k used cars($5k for early NAs)  when I think it 
would be better to compare to a higher class of performance automobiles.  
Ever price work on a rotary engine RX-7 :-(  I had a shop who wouldn't 
replace a damaged rear axle half-shaft because it had a ROTARY engine.  
Ever tried to get cold a/c out of a 911.  Oops, that's a Porsche, too :-)  I 
think I represent a common picture of a 944 daily driver.  I've got $400 
worth of shop manuals, $1000 worth of tools and the NUMBER 1 
PORSCHE REPAIR TOOL (a checkbook).

Note that this isn't really directed at your concern.  This is more a 
counterpoint for all the postings from people who won't buy this type of 
car because they aren't listening to what you're saying about a specific 
type of problem and applying to the car as a whole.

And, if a future buyer goes with a Vette instead, I have a piece of advice:
Only race a Porsche in a straight line!!
