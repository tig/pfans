When I had someone "fix" my car (a '79 924), he said that I was missing
the idle adjustment screw.  I thought this was pretty strange since he was
then able to adjust the idle by turning a screw in a projection out from
the throttle body.  What's this other screw do?  It looks like it can be
moved to keep the gas pedal depressed a certain distance all the time.  I
would've thought it would be for picking up slack in the throttle cable.

Other question, possibly related: the idle on my car seems to wander quite
a bit.  When I start the car, it comes on at about 500 rpm (this is a cold
start).  After driving for a few minutes, it gets up to about 900-1000. 
After driving for half an hour or more, it goes up further, sometimes as
high as 1500 rpm.  This is sort of good - starts in first are smoother
'cause I barely have to step on the gas - but I wonder if it's indicative
of some deeper problem.

Oh, and even though nobody replied to my earlier lament about leaking
engines: it's not leaking oil now.  I took it up to 4500, 5000, 5500, and
6000 in rapid succession (different times) and the oil is still there. 
There is a somewhat alarming transformer-ish smell when the engine gets up
to 5500, though.  Also, doing this in 5th makes the "gas pedal" stick
(that's what it feels like, but the pedal moves normally) unless I jump
off the gas.

Well, that's it.  Thanks for any replies I'll hopefully get this time.
