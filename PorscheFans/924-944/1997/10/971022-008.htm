Justin,

As an owner of a 1980 931, I can tell you that although the price sounds
nice, you should be aware of the potential money pit these cars can be (and
it sounds like this one might be)  The exhaust manifolds were/are prone to
cracking, particularly if the turbo was installed incorrectly.  These are
VERY expensive with new ones in the 700 - 1000 dollar range, and used ones
being difficult to locate in good condition.  The turbo units themselves
are problematic, since their positioning on the engine does not lend itself
to proper oil drainage, and their basic design is aged a bit.  They do last
decently if installed properly and you observe proper cool off and warm up
procedures.

Electrical problems exist with all the 924 series, and the turbo is no
exception.  I'm sure you can find numerous people with solutions...

IMHO, if you are on a limited budget, this is not the car for you.  The
little parts are rediculously expensive, and although vw/audi part
equivalents do exist for some things, the 924 turbo had enough special
Porsche-only parts to make them insignificant.

The 80 transmission is unique to the 79 and 80 turbo, and was Porsche-built
(different than other 924/944s, which were audi built) and as a result, the
parts are difficult and expensive to find.  I was successful at having some
parts custom machined for mine, although I would not want to repeat the
process.

Best Regards
