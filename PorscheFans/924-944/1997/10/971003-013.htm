Qassim, I read your post with great interest. Living in Calgary and
having moved to an acreage in the spring snow tires will be a necessity.
I'm not planning on driving my P-cars this winter as the snow is too
deep where I live and I just purchased an Isuzu Impulse AWD turbo (I
can't stand driving, sitting in, paying for or putting gas into any fuel
sucking SUVs or trucks - personal prefernece). I'ld like to get feedback
from the list on snow tires preferences and performance. I was planning
on buying Blizzaks for my Impulse but apparently they don't come in
205/50/15s. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

I have used in order of preference.
> 1) Blizzaks (very good for ice and snow but terrible for handling)
> 2) Pirelli 210s (good for snow,- So, so, on ice. good handling and comes in
> Pcar sizes- 205-55-and 225-50-16s)
> 4) Toyo Studded (cannot remember the series - would not recommend them)
> I have also used Dunlops and Yokohamas previous generation and therefore
> old technology - I was not impressed with either.  Perhaps their new
> iterations are better.
> I have been told that the new Michelin Alpins are pretty good and so are
> the Toyo Observes - similar compound to the Blizzaks, I believe.
