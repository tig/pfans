I have a set of 16 X 7 gold BBS mesh rims in good condition.  The only thing 
they need is center caps which cost about $8 a piece from BBS.  The original 
came off a 944 and the asking price is $500 plus shipping.  Please mail me 
direct with any responses.

Thank you,
Robert Zimmerman

<x-fontsize><param>9</param>Hello P-philes:


I read with interest Gregor Diseth <<gsdiseth=40efn.org>'s posting on the

Octiber 24th Digest. Waxing both philosophic and nostalgic, my two cents ab=
out Gregor's remarks:


Gregor makes three good points with which I totally agree:


1) > our beloved cars do/did have several built in design flaws, as witness=
ed by the FAQ


2) >The annoying thing about Porsche is it took years for them to correct=20

>these flaws, instead of researching warranty claims and correcting next=20

>years production.=20


3) >PCNA could further the Porsche cause and increase sales and customer

>loyalty by taking responsibility on some 'out of warranty' warranty claims=


>on these known, repetitive failures instead of ignoring the customer.=20



I have a different perspective about a fourth point he makes:


>People with a Toyota Camry mentality were never meant to own these cars.


In the early 70's, I was a service advisor/warranty geek for a P-A dealer. =
I can speak with some knowledge about this time period. For subsequent year=
s I have anecdotal information based on my continued friendship with servic=
e technicians and managers at various P-A dealerships.


I think it is the ability of Porsche to market the =22mystique=22 of their =
cars which allows them to treat the issue of quality control with less than=
 their utmost scrutiny. I will not get into the issue of drivetrain parts. =
Certainly there is merit in the claim that because the engines are complex =
and sophisticated, they should require more maintenance and repair. But I t=
hink this arguement lacks merit when talking about switchgear, clutches, HV=
AC, suspension, etc.=20


Ultimately the stick in the throat for many people are the prices charged b=
y Porsche for common  parts. Those on the list with memories spanning to th=
e 50's can well-document VW parts with Porsche numbers affixed. The =22extr=
a charge=22 for 944 CV joints which are from a VW van is a present case. I =
also fail to understand why waterpumps, for example, are so expensive and s=
o short-lived and ball joints are non-repairable.


If I understand Gregor's point about =22Camry mentality=22 correctly, he me=
ans =22people who buy a car and expect it to perform flawlessly without mai=
ntenance for 150,000 miles.=22 If that's the case, I agree that Porsche own=
ership is not compatible with that attitude.  However, I think it's reasona=
ble to assume that it is well within any modern automobile manufacturer's a=
bility to produce a car (even in limited numbers as Porsches are) where the=
 niggly little bits that function virtually forever on, yes=21 Toyota Camry=
s, could be trouble free on their cars, too.


Trust that this is not a flame or a bitch. I think that Porsches are wonder=
ful cars, warts (that may be too strong a word) and all. But there are many=
 people who buy and have bought them unprepared for their, uh, idiocyncraci=
es, that have bitter memories.


Like the woman who, on delivery of her 71 914, couldn't find reverse to bac=
k away from the showroom. =22Not a problem=21=22 says the salesman, who hop=
s in, shuts the car off and deftly locates reverse. =22It's easy, once you =
get the hang of it=21 Take it to a large parking lot and practice.=22 The n=
ew owner, with the bliss of future Porsche driving in her eyes and the beam=
ing salesman next to the car, starts her new toy up, zings it to about 3500=
 rpm, dumps the clutch...and stuffs it right into the side of the building.=
 Inside the showroom, two salesmen who were watching exchange glances, whil=
e one hands a ten dollar bill to the other.


Regards,


Gary
