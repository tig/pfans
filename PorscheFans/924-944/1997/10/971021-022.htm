   1.   An update on my gear shift looseness:

         I replaced the gear shift bushing but unfortunately the looseness

is still there. I think the bushing at the trans is going to be the

solution. Can anyone give me the part #(s) for the shift rod bushing(s) at

the top of the trans. BTW what do I ask for to get the parts catalog from

the dealer, the one that Don McGill gives away with a $50 order? Is it

called a parts catalog?



    2.   Can anyone give me advice on the pros and cons of the

poly-graphite plastic front suspension bushings(Weltmeister, World

Champion). I do primarily highway driving and no competition driving

however I like to drive fairly hard on winding country roads. I am also

replacing the front strut cartridges with Boge gas.



   Thanks in advance,

Hi Joe & P-Fans
	The parts book that you are looking for is called the: "Parts and Technical
Refference Catalog" Porsche part#PNA-000-147-A,  list price of $10.  
	Boge gas shocks are "OK" but I would highly reccomend Bilstein shocks! They
will last forever, ride ride is firm, but not harsh. When you go over major
bumps the shock has a special piston that opens to soften the ride over
severe "pot holes"! If Bilstien made shocks for my car ('86 951) I would have
a set on my car instead I have Koni's which are "Ok" but I have already blown
one in less than a year after installing them! I think I saw AJ-USA selling
Bilstien's at [retty good prices if only I could find their catalog! 
	I'm not a big fan of "poly-graphite plastic" bushings unless you are
building a track car! The "poly-graphite plastic" bushing will squeak and
groan forever! They realy do firm up they steering input and handling but at
the loss of ride comfort. I would just replace the "tired and worn out"
suspension bushings with OEM Porsche ones. If you are looking for a "crisper"
handling I would first replace your tires - you will notice a "Huge"
improvement, more so than with "poly-graphite plastic" bushings! 

						Good Luck, David Jalali
