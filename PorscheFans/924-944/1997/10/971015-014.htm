I have a similar problem. I have a vibration in the shift lever at 3100
(smaller harmonic at 2100) whether I'm in motion or not. It is felt with
clutch in or out, in gear or out. Do you have the same symptoms ?

I have had the clutch, belts (checked orientation), and mounts replaced.
Since the vibration occurs with clutch in, I think the problem must be
forward of the clutch. Maybe the flywheel (it was machined when clutch
was replaced, vibration amplitude decreased marginally) or something is
unbalanced in the engine. I've had since I bought the car 2 yrs ago. Any
advice would be appreciated.
