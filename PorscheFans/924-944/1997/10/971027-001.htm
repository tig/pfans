Recent article in Porsche Club magazine suggested that 1980 and later
924 NA run on 98 Octane Super Green, 924 pre-80 and all Turbos are
leaded-only through.
Running on regular 95 Octane lead-free may be possible using the Broquet
fuel catalyst - anyone tried this ?

any

Try Peart Associates 01539 730666

>And thirdly does anyone know any Upholstery co's round the Oxford area
as the

Can't help here
