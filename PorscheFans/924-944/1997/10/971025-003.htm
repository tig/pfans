Subject: Aux. Water pump

I try sending my answer again, the last one seemed to get garbled!

Hi All,
Has anyone changed their auxillary water pump on a 951? What is
involved, and does anyone have any recommendations for a procedure? I
haven't got the shop manuals and the haynes manual is no help.   Thanks in
advance.

Hey Paul & P-Fans
	Changing your auxillary water pump on a 951 isn't very difficult. The
hardest part will be bledding the cooling system. But before you replace the
pump - try these steps first. 
	Sometimes the clamp holding auxillary water pump causes the motor shaft to
bind. Simply loosen the clamp - securing the body of the auxillary water pump
to the bracket, and let the housing settle in place. I've seen this fix some
cars. The pump is located to the right of the throttle body, next to the
black intake pipe and the coolant expansion tank, it is a round cylinder
shaped, gold in color. 
	 Check to make sure that the auxillary water pump is getting power. If you
touch the electric turbo coolant sensor wire to ground, for a second or two -
the pump should come on for 30 sec's (if this does not happen check the
"turbo water pump relay" part#951-618-149-00 or the fuse). The ignition key
does not have to be on for the pump to opperate. Also if you connect the
sensor wire to ground - the pump will run untill the ground source is
released. The coolant temp sensor is located to the left of the throttle
body, a single wire sensor. 

					Good Luck, DJ
