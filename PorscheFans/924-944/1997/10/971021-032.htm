Subject: 944 Places in So. Cal?

I'll be in the Los Angeles area early next week, and am free to wander a
short while for personal business.  I'd like to know if there are any
interesting P-car places to visit.  Any exceptional businesses or museums?


Hello John & P-Fans
	There is a realy cool museum in Downtown LA called the "Peterson Museum", it
cronicles the Automobile through its life. I heard it is a must see! Be sure
to stop into a "In & Out" fast-food burger joint (all over southern Ca)  - a
1960's type hambuger joint - they also have neat T-Shirts and Great Food! 
	You did not say when you will be there but Porsche will be racing their FIA
GT-1 race car at Luguna Friday & Saturday October 24th & 25th, at Luguna
Secca Raceway in Monteray, north of LA! Porsche will have their factory works
car their - I know because I was just at Sebring, FL this past weekend! The
Rorh Racing Porsche GTS-1 car clitched the seasons manufacturing points
championship  battle for Porsche! There were five Porche FAI GT-1 cars, seven
BMW McClaren GT cars, three Panoz and three Mercedes SLK-GTR's -what a race
that was! 

					Good Luck, David Jalali
