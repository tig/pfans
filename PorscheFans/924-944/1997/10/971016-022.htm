Hi All,

I thought this may interest the group.

 And thanks you for the interest in this small invention.

I made 50 of these pads and only have 16 left! Last chance, for a little 
while anyway) for a simple, safe and fairly cheap Porsche "helper" tool. 
I have contacted and sent samples to: Automotion, Performance Products, 
Tweeks, Griots Garage and several other mail order companies. I will also 
advertise the in Excellence and Panorama. They have expressed interest 
and I hope will add this item to their catalogs. Unfortunately the price 
will be a little more (about $ 3.00-$4.00). I will continue to sell them 
to PorscheFans list members as long as there is a demand. 




Great News!!!

I have fabricated a jack pad for lifting the 924S, 944(1985 1/2-91) 968, 
Carrera 2/4 and 993 series. When a pad is not used you could be damaging 
the SKS undercoating and the underside of the car! The pad which is 
fabricated from a hard rubber material will not damage the jack point 
areas or unnecessarily remove the protective SKS. It is very similar to 
the factory pad that was used on the assembly line during production.
It is also designed to mate to the reccomended lifting points, avoiding 
any slipping that may occur during the lifting process. I have tested it 
several times and it insures a stable mount between the car and jack. It 
is much better then anything I have ever seen from any of the mail order 
companies. It will also work with the 951 model, not causing any damage 
to the lower plastic trim.

"THE JACK PAD" FACTS: 

 The pad thickness is 1" and is 3.0" in diameter. It has an 2" cut out in 
the center 1/4" deep. A rubber center piece is fitted to the center of 
this 2" cutout for alignment to holes in the center of the jack points.  
I remove the jack dish plate and place the pad directly on the jack. This 
eliminates the need for wood blocks etc. The price is $9.75 (includes 
shipping and handling). If for any reason you are not satisified with the 
"Jack Pad" you can it for a full refund. I am also working on some jack 
stands that will be custom made for Porsche underbodies. I will keep you 
posted.
