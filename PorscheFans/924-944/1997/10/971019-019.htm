Hi Pfans

Got a chance to spend most of the day on my 951 engine replacement project.    
 Got everything of f the original engine ('87) that I'm going to use - 
headers, filter/cooler housing, turbo,  motor mount brackets, and oil pan.    
Only now has the amount of damage done by the PO become apparent. (Ran the 
engine with no oil)  The block had a hole about 2" square under the left 
(turbo) side motor mount.  One of the mount bosses was knocked off the block.  
A lumpy protrusion on the outside of the pan , when cleaned up, proved ro be a 
rod bolt sticking through.  The #2  rod big end was broken off about even with 
the bottom of the piston.  The big end and cap were shattered into numerous 
pieces.  The amount of damage was quite amazing.

My expert mechanic friend and I decided to replace the head gasket and rod 
bearings in the replacement engine (good advice, Jim Richmond) and we are 
ordering gaskets, bolts, clutch package, hoses, water pump, belts, etc. etc.

Next step is to remove the head and pan from the replacement engine.  Have to 
check to see whether the '87 baffle will fit the '86 pan.  ('87 said to be 
better than '86)  If not, the '87 pan goes to the welder's.  Flywheel to be 
machined.  Clutch to be ordered.  This is getting expensive, but progress is 
being made.

Comments, questions, and advice welcome.

(I like reading these kinds of posts from others so thought I'd do some myself 
 - If  anyone minds, will stop)
