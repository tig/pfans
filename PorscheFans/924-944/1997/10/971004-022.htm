Larger numbers on the gauge are tighter on the belt...

I would not suggest loosening the belt further. It would increase the =
chance of jumping a tooth,
with dire consequences...

Good Luck!

Subject: Belt tension.


|I just had the car in to have the new belts retensioned at the =
requested
|1000 mile interval.  Apparently, the latest updates from PCNA state the
|'used' specification is 2.0 +/-.3 (microfiche workshop manual says 2.7
|+/-.3).  Since that horrible whine from the balance belt is still =
there, I
|asked him to tension to the slack end of the range. The mechanic set it =
to
|1.8.  However, the whine is still present.=20
|
|So, are larger numbers on the gauge tighter, or looser?  Kevin Gross' =
FAQ=20
|states higher numbers are looser, contrary to what my mechanic says.
|
|I am tempted, at the risk of being sentenced to Porsche hell, to remove =

|the cover and slacken the balance shaft belt a bit more to see if the=20
|whine goes away.  When I brought the car in for the water pump change,=20
|the balance belt was very loose, but quiet.  After being tensioned with =

|the gauge, it was dramatically tighter (by observation and feel).
|
|Comments, public or private, would be appreciated on this subject.  I=20
|want the belt whine _gone_ as it was before the water pump change.. =
there=20
|is no arguing with the holy tension gauge, so I have no grounds to =
argue=20
|with my shop, although I made my displeasure about the whine very =
clear.
|
|Again, comments welcome.  Thanks!
