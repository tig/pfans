Hi, Paul,

I leave mine on my track car for two reasons:

1a) If I need to be towed in, I don't have to crawl out and install it.
There is no other place to attach
a tow rope to a 951.

1b) In the spring, I have seen drivers in six inches of water at the
entrance to the esses at Lime Rock.
I figure that if the tow eye is already there, I might get lucky and not
have to get too wet to get the rope
attached.

2a) If someone else needs to be towed in, I know exactly where the tow eye
is... e.g. at our last LRP event
(you were there) and the 951 lost the coolant hose, he didn't have a tow
attach point, and was holding
up the event while I sprinted with the tow eye in hand.

2b) If it is attached to the front of the car, it is not rattling around in
the cabin of the car, could be pretty
lethal in the case of a sudden change in momentum (i.e. crash).
"In the land of the blind, the one (tow) eyed man is king!"

Lastly, the eye screws directly into the bumper support, and will take at
least one ton of force, if used
properly, without damage to the car, or the tow eye...


Good Luck!

|Wow, people in your region must not get out too often. Around here it

|
|As a downside to these tow eyes that are left in place all the time, I
|wonder what kind of damage it would cause to the lucky car in front in
|the event of a 5-10 mph collision?
|
|I also wonder how many people have their bumpers pulled off or bent when
|it is used improperly?
