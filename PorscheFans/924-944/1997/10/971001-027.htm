I hope this hasn't been answered yet.  The stock turbo of the normal model
is a K26-6.  The "6" represents the exhaust housing size and I believe that
is a volume number as in 6cm^3 of area in the exhaust housing.  The larger
the housing, the less restriction once under boost, but it takes longer
to build boost with the larger area.  The "S" models come with a K26-8
with the 8cm^3 housing.  My Turbo S book says that the vanes are different
on the turbine wheel, but I haven't seen my turbo out of the car yet (thank
God).  If you look at the dyno results we did that compare the "S" and
normal models, you can see the effects of the turbo easily.  The normal
model's boost comes in 500-1000rpm earlier than the "S" model, but it's
curve dies off fairly quickly, whereas the "S" model holds over 250ft-lbs
of torque at the wheels from 3500-5500rpm and then dies off.  The normal
model can only hold that level from 3000-4000rpm and then it dies off
rapidly.  Both cars are chipped in the above examples.

The compressor side of both turbos are the same.  A K27 is basically a
K27 compressor with a K26 turbine wheel in a K27/K26 compress/exhaust housing.
