 '87  924S >>

Sorry to disagree Chipper old buddy, but I must.  I was wrong about it
requiring 91 octane, but it does require 90 (had not read the manual in a
while).  90 or 91 equals the same problem, as midgrade is only 89.  

To quote from my manual, page 44:

"Minumum octane rating is is 95 RON (90 CLC or AKI rating on U.S. fuel
pumps)."

The last time I actually looked at the pump, I believe it still had the
formula R+M/2. With RON being 95 and 95 RON converting to 90 CLC or AKI on
the US pumps as per that method, I feel that I am correct in stating that it
needs 90 octane as we know it here in the states.  Perhaps there was a
difference in the 1987 and 1988 models due to the higher compression, but I
tell you the truth - that is what the manual says as well as the filler cap
door.
