For all of you that have replied to attend the White-Allen tech session 
this Saturday, I would like to say thank you.

If there is anyone else that would like to attend, well, the doors will 
be wide open.  This will be a golden opportunity to learn how to install 
your own timing belts, increase your working knowledge of your cars, or 
just take advantage of this as a social event.   Any way you do is great.

The event is located on Rout 741, just North of Route 725, in South 
Dayton, Ohio at White-Allen.  For directions you can call them at 937 
291-6000.

For your interest, I have no association with White-Allen, just a 
satisfied customer.

See everyone at 11:00 AM this Saturday, October 11th!

Marv
937 237-9711

Post Script:

So far the number of RSVPs lean heavily in favor of PorscheFans list 
members.  Way to go!
