<<  The cheapest way(s) to get more horses outta your engine is to buy a 
      K&N air filter, this will increase the C.F.M. (some measurement of air 
      flow) into the engine by 59% (they have a website or you can order it 
      from performance products). Also, you can buy a throttle response cam 
      (under $25) which increases...ta da! your throttle respone. Those are 
      the cheapest and easiest methods I know of increasing power. If you 
      want the whole sha-bang you might want to consider buying the package 
      offered by performance products which includes the chip, air filter 
      and throttle response cam for around $450. Hope this helps.

Sorry -- I have to disagree with this advice.
  
1- While the K&N may allow greater airflow, I haven't seen any evidence that
the stock engine can use any more than the stock paper filter allows.
 (Farzaan -- did you ever have a chance to check out the K&N on the dyno?)

2- As noted many times on this list, the throttle response cam has NO impact
on power output.  It simply makes it FEEL like you have more power by opening
the throttle more with less pedal input.  I believe that this is packaged
with the chip and K&N to give the illusion of more power.

3- On a non-turbo 944, a well-engineered aftermarket chip can add a small
amount of horsepower and torque, arguably not enough to make them worth the
cost.

Bottom Line -- Based on my experience and having followed this list for quite
a while now,  there is NO inexpensive way to obtain any more than a very
small increase in output from an n/a 944.  Focus on handling (and, of course,
driving skills).  That where you get bang for the buck and big smiles out of
a 944.
