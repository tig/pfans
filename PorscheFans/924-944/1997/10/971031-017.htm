Hi everyone , 

Since I change jobs and lost emial at work I haven't been able to keep up with you 
all much lately so I hope this isn't something that has been raised before.

I bought a 968 back in Feb of this year and since then it has been though 3 
crankshaft rear main oil seals . Thankfully the first one was done by Porsche before 
I bought the car , so the rest have also been done by them under warranty.

Has anyone else come across similiar problems ? Any ideas as to what is causing the 
problem ?

Apart from this the car is as far as I can tell perfectly OK.

Hope someone can help.


Cheers
Richard
