If the plastic stops are broken, you can make a replacement as posted by a 
fellow in Australia, or you can make a wire/cable replacement:

>        2. The plastic covering the instrument panel appears to be dirty
>from the inside? Is there an easy way            to remove this for cleaning?
I have no experience with this, anyone else?

>        3. My turn signals while all functioning appear to blink very fast.
>Is this normal?
One or more of your blinker bulbs is probably the incorrect replacement, 
drawing too much current or your relay is in need of replacement. Also, make 
sure you check your blinker fluid, if you have questions about that, ask Ben.

>        4. Has anybody purchased the shifter repair kit for $47 advertised
>in the mags? If so is it worthwhile?
You need to pull your shift boot up and check to see if the joint is worn to 
determine if you need a new one.

>        5. Does anybody make a sunshade specifically for the 944?        
I use the wire hoop type with silver on one side, bought it at Walmart. The 
package is labeled that it fits 944's. The rear view mirror gets in the way a 
bit, but it works.

>the front spoiler? My guess is            you can't keep one of them due to
>the low clearance. Am I right?        
Can't help you with this one..

>        7. My dash night lighting appears to be very dim when turned up as
>high is it can be. Is this typical?
Mine is dim as well at full brightness, but who needs to see that speedo 
anyway, too busy maneuvering around corners...

>Enough already!! TIA

Good Luck,
