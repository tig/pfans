    I have a 90 S2 Cab that I absolutely love.  I've had the car about a =
year now, and have found this list to be a great source of information =
and entertainment.  I drive the car daily, except for winter, and have =
experienced only two minor problems.  There is a significant vibration =
through the shifter at about 3200 rpm.  But it only seems to occur for =
maybe 100 rpm, then goes away.  Any ideas?  The other problem is in the =
door locks.  Occasionally, the car refuses to be locked.  Whether I use =
the key outside the car, or the button on the console, the locks engage, =
then immediately disengage.  I've found that I can force the lock to =
stay engaged by holding the key in the lock position a few extra =
seconds.  The locks attempt to unlock, but holding the key down seems to =
overpower them.  By the way, my brother is a priest if an exorcism is =
the recommended cure.=20

Thanks,
Steve Stroupe  =20
