I would be suspicious about one of the cogs.  Look at the belt for wear 
marks on the teeth.  You should not loose teeth on your belt, unless... 
your water pump is not the updated variety.

There should be a steel plate that separates the timing belt as it passes 
over the water pump.  If you don't have that plate, a loose belt can 
contact itself at that point and sheer teeth off just as you described.
