Hi All,

My 2 cents worth on the matter of changing only one end of the car
regarding sway bars; I did this once on my 74 Capri, which I loved; but
that is another story.

Changing either the spring rate or the sway bar on one end will affect
the balance of the car, definitely. Think of the springs as supporting
the car's weight, while the sway bars resist the tendency of the body to
roll about it's own center (or fore aft axis). 

By increasing the spring rate and / or increasing the sway bar thickness
at one axle only, you force that outboard tire to support more weight or
load. In the case of a static situation, ie parked, the springs will
control ride height, but the sway bar will do nothing; again assuming
the car is parked on level pavement. BUT, when cornering, the body roll
caused by inertia puts additional loads on the suspension, ultimately
transferred to the road by the tires. By increasing the spring rate and
/ or sway bar size you cause more of the load imposed by inertia from
cornering to transfer to the more stiffly sprung end of the car and / or
the axle with the higher roll resistance caused by the combination of
spring rate and sway bar size. Remember, the inertia load from cornering
must be in equilibrium, so both ends of the car absorb these forces. 

The final result is by putting more force on one end of the car, that
one tire has to "work" harder, getting more traction ( traction = force
x coefficient of friction). So, that end will have more "bite" while the
other end will have less "bite"; take this too far and you will lose
control because there will be insufficient traction at the unmodified
end to keep control, skids, twitchy behaviour etc. will result.

I know, I did this, and luckily I guessed right, the car went from a
mushy rear end with no rear sway bar ( a 74 short coming for Capri's )
to nicely balanced in corners. Originally the car had no rear sway bar,
so, all the loading in cornering was taken up by the front tires, which
would let me spin it out easily. After the car was balanced it was much
faster, but, there was no margin for error. If you went in to a corner
too fast it was white knuckle time until you scrubbed enough speed to
get under control again. 

Hope that helps you decide, and I apologize in advance if I confused
anyone out there. Not being an expert, I hope I explained it well
enough. You may want to check these thoughts out with some of the more
knowledgeable guys on the group who race. I 'm pretty sure that they
will agree with me; but then, they own a 944, I don't.
