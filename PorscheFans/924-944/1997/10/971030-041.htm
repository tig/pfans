OK, this is going to brand me as a complete novice but WTF that's 
what I am. I just discovered the torque wrench. No, not the one that 
bends. I've been using that one. I mean the big, hurkin', two hander 
that looks like a penis on steroids(sorry, ladies). This thing makes 
getting the wheels on and off a joy! I may be the last one to get 
this thing but just in case there are some other novices out there. 
If you're using the other kind...forget it. Go to Autozone and get 
the good one($25)...worth every penny of it on the first use. And to 
boot, it made a tremendous improvement in front wheel shimmy and I 
have bad, out of balance tires, and its out of alignment too... all 
getting fixed next week.
My turn to get gushy. I LOVE this list and I LOVE my Porsche.
And to Mr. WOT while I'm rambling...You _are_ da Porsche Man. I think 
you were one of the first posts that I read and while I'll never 
experience 1% of what you do in these machines I appreciate your 
dedication and love of the marque. Keep writing.
