Thanks for the feedback, but I have one question. You mention having seen
belts tensioned to 10 p9201 units, can I assume that this is just the
overtensioning whith which they came to you and NOT the tension imposed by
the built in device (I would hope not). If the device was capable of
overtensioning to that degree I would not be inclined to use it. My
assumption is that it tensions to the "maintenance tension of around 2.7
p9201 units" and not the "new belt setting" which is considerably higher. I
would like to think that the built in device is adequately accurate for
frequent checking (say every oil change). I am talking about a non-raced
street car. It might also be helpful to know the released lenght of the
spring in the device as means of checking it., but perhaps at that point the
$375. investment would be worth it.
