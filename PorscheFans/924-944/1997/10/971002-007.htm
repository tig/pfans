I remember this incident.  I don't remember who was involved, however I
remember that the dealership had the car towed to the auto-body shop.  On the
way the driver lost the car through an intersection (it was on one of those
front wheel trolleys).  The tow company only had $10,000 coverage, and the
dealer wouldn't foot the remaining bill.

Does anyone know what exactly happened after the accident?
