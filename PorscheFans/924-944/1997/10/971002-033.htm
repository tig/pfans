Some other experiences:

I bought a single 16" phone dial wheel several months ago from Sonnen
Porsche in San Rafael, CA.  The wheels were all housed in a "bunker" at the
end of the lot, and the guy from the parts counter came out with me.  The
wheels were new but some had very slight cosmetic flaws.  I ended up
opening every single box of phone dials--at least a dozen wheels or so, and
the guy was moving and stacking all sorts of C2, Fuchs, 993, wheels,
etc.--just so I could look at a phone dials.  I know, this is the worst
thing I could probably do, but he never complained, and even lined up bunch
of wheels together so I could see how the finish differed slightly from
wheel to wheel.  I did end up buying one, so I guess that helped, but I
thought that was pretty cool service.

I also bought a shock tower stress bar from Automotion way back in 1993.
Paid about $180 for it back then.  I never liked the way it fit--the right
front corner of the hood never closed all the way because one end of the
bar was pushing it up.  I was living overseas at the time and the 951 sat
for months on end.  When I finally got around to calling Automotion, in
1995(!) they acknowledged that there was a manufacturing defect in the bars
and the newer design did not have this problem.  I asked if I could upgrade
to the new bar.  They said yes, if I had the receipt, which I still did.
So, one Friday afternoon I take a leisurely drive, receipt in hand, and
proceed to swap bars.  I did the removal right in their parking lot, and
they even lent me a can of spray lubricant when one of the old bolts seized
and I couldn't get it off with my wrench.  I gave them the old bar and they
gave me a brand new one--two years later, can you believe that?!  To top it
off, I asked if they had any Automotion stickers, and they threw in one of
those huge $8.00 "AUTOMOTION" winshield decals, totally free.

I had a slightly less positive experience with the folks at Wheel
Enhancement (what's the deal anyway with the Wheel Enhancement-Robert Wood
relationship, etc?).  Before I bought the replacement phone dial, I asked
for a quote to refinish my existing set.  They said I would be better off
in just moving up to a 17" wheel and tire upgrade, and quoted me a price of
about $1,700 for replica C2s and Dunlop SP8000s.  Not bad, I thought, and I
fell for the sales pitch.  They were very clear in telling me that the
wheels were not in stock but would be shipped early the following week.
Overnight I thought about it and I decided to cancel the order the next
day--it sounded like a good deal but it was way more than what I was
prepared to pay at the time, and my 16" AVSs were still in fine shape, but
they didn't care about this.  I called them the next day, and, although the
wheels had not shipped, I was told that my credit card had already been run
through.  I told them I was genuinely sorry and asked them to cancel the
order.  They tried one final very aggressive sales pitch but my mind was
made up.  They were never openly hostile, but I was told that I was "making
life hard" for them and I got the impression that they now viewed me as a
bottom-feeder, whereas only 24 hours before they were going out of their
way to sell me on these wheels.  It was just a mess, frankly, and I'm sorry
it happened.  In the end, I found out that the credit card was not charged
at all.  I suppose I'm equally to blame for not being able to make up my
mind, but any company that takes out full-page ads in excellence and
Panorama would, one assumes, have the professionalism to just say," OK,
just call us back when you're ready," rather than alienating a potential
future customer for good.
