Hello, after much heated debate I won the war of a lifetime. I conceded to
buy a new four door vehicle of my choice, and a new vw VR6 Jetta for my wife.
And then I get to keep my 87 944s for weekends!!!!!! It is a wonderful
world!!!
The problem is, I think I may have another problem with the car. While
driving home today, I took off at a light and the gear shift lever seemed to
pop. All of the gears work as they should, and I dont hear any strange noises
coming from the transmission. But I do not remember there being any "play" in
the lever like there is now. When in a gear (any gear) there is a full 2-3
inches of play both left and right and forward and back. Am I not remembering
correctly, or is there a problem here?
It doesnt seem to shift any different. If anyone could please reply, I would
really appreciate it.
And I promise, siome day I will have some type of help for one of you!!!!
