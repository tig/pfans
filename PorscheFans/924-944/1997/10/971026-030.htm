 I just wish the clutch in my 951S would last as long. The small springs
 in the 951S clutch, now that I would consider a design flaw.

I too got 110,000 miles on an 85.5 clutch (actually, I sold the car but it's
still going on the original clutch).  By contrast, I just had to replace the
clutch on my 88 951S with 42,000 miles.  I'm only responsible for the last
10,000 miles, and it was the TO bearing that croaked first.  It had been
making noise for quite a while, especially when cold, and then got really bad
all of a sudden.  I got an excellent price on a "Cup Car" package and equally
good advice from Jason Burkett at Paragon Products -- he knew all the right
ancillary parts to replace, and then called me back the next day when he had
trouble locating some bolts, to let me know I should source them locally!
 Everything else arrived exactly when he said it would.

The problem with the throwout bearing, as well as all the other bearings in
the assembly (pilot, release shaft needle bearings, etc) was age and bad
grease.  It had dried to a white powder and disintegrated.  Mike Kehr's FAQ
highlights this as a problem and points out that Porsche now recommends a
different grease (MoS2?).  Thanks, Mike.  The needle bearings had dried out
so much that I had to also replace the release arm shaft that rides in them. 

The other thing I noticed was that, while the little springs in the driven
disk hadn't broken, a couple of them were about to fall out of their
"housings."  I apologize if this has been noted before, but it was
enlightening to me to see what causes this problem (or at least appeared to
be about to cause it on mine).  As the clutch center twists against the
little springs, the springs wear against the slots they're seated in.
Eventually, the slots wear enough for the springs to fall out. 

The new "Cup Car" clutch works great!  Smooth, positive takeup -- and with
working bearings it's as light as a feather!
