     Porsche-fans,
     
     I just joined - thanks for all the insight, this is a great group.
     
     This may have been addressed previously, please point me in the right 
     direction if so.
     
     I have and love an '84 944.
     
     The sunroof goes up whenever it likes. When I press the switch, it 
     moves down an inch and moves back up as soon as I release. This occurs 
     often and I have to keep trying the switch to see if it will let me 
     close up. Then I have to quickly remove the fuse before it moves back 
     up again.
     
     A 'reputable; mechanic informed me this is a common problem and that 
     replacing the switch would not solve it - that he could spend hour$ of 
     labor tracing the short and still not locate the problem. 
     
     If it is in fact a common problem, it seems there is a common 
     solution...Could this be an issue with a relay?
     
     I guess I should be happy this trivial issue is my only problem (knock 
     on wood), but very frustrating none-the-less. I fear if left 
     unresolved, it may get worse.
