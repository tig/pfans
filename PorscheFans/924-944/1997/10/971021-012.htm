Hmm, I think that the comparison between the S2 and the TS is unfair. 
Especially if the TS is chipped, check out Farzaan's dyno graphs w/ the
APE and Turbo Cup chips.  The stock TS will kick the @#$%@# out of most
other Porsches, including non-turbo 964s or whatever variant of Detroit
iron may come its way.  The S2 has not been demonstrated to do that but it
has the low-end grunt to rule on many autocross courses over a non-S
turbo.  You put the pedal down and it goes, no turbo lag.  Take your pick,
immediate gratification or ...eventual bliss :-)

However, it should be said that the 3.0l 4-cylinder S2 compared to the
Civic VTECs (1.6 or 1.8l?), your Capri V6 (engine size?) or the Alfa 2.5l
V6s does seem to rev slowly (the S2 I had test driven had 62k miles). Most
other 944 variants (except the very late 944s) have a 2.5l engine with
less reciprocating mass and seem to like to rev better.  My old 944S had
the overall shorter gearing of the 944 NA rather than the long gearing of
the T and with the clutch in or out had no problems seeking the rev
limiter with alacrity (though only once did it find it).  I have not had a
chance to explore the upper rpm range of the 968, so I do not know if the
VarioCam and the improved induction system made the engine more rev happy. 

Of course, none of this is meant as a flame, the cars are simply different
beasts.
