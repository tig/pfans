I have seen a few comments about young people owning 944's and also about
some 911 owners being a-holes..well here is my .02......I am 18, own a 83
944, worked 2 jobs over the summer to pay for it, my shop knows I pay for all
of my own stuff, yet everyone I talk to ask's how long my father has owned
the car, when I tell them that it is mine the next question from they're
mouths are, "oh when did your parents buy it for you?"  i just kinda say
whatever and go about my business.  OK now on to the 911 thing, in my small
neighborhood there are 2 911 owners, as far as I can tell from seeing them
and attempting to talk to them, they are the biggest snobs I've ever met,
I've seen it in other 911 owners also, actually now that I think of it, only
1 911 owner that I can think of ever even waived back at me, it was an
elderly gentleman in a black 92 or so 911 turbo here in Fort Wayne Indiana,
ok that was just my .02 thank you.
