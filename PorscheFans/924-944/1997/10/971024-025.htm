Hi George,

As usual, you speak with non-forked tongue. 

I was really questioning the (mis)use of the tow eye outside of racing
venues where the tow operators might not undertand it's function. The
bumper attachments may be able to withstand a decent amount of force,
but I certainly wouldn't want to see it used for much besides a
straightforward tow back to the paddock after being stranded on a race
track. I know at least one sanctioning group (the one formerly know as
IMSA) that requires a tow eye to be present on all race cars for the
reasons you specified.

If it is left in place on a street car it could cause some significant
damage in a fender bender where the bumpers would usually protect the
cars. Or it may be used in an attempt to pull the car out of a ditch. 

However, I did see a street 951 in the paddock at Watkins Glen last
weekend equipped with a tow eye and the bumper was about 1/2 inch longer
in the middle than it should be. I didn't ask the owner how it had
happened. 

Regards,

Paul Foster

BTW, thanks again for the instruction at Watkins Glen!
