Hi,

Just wanted to share a bit of info.  I could always smell fuel when turning
and even worse when accelerating up hills and turning.  It turns out that
the gas cap just wasn't sealing tight enough due to the locking cap design.
 It just doesn't allow you to turn it tight enough before it's clutch or
whatever it is that snaps loose kicks in.  (hmm maybe it's broken)  Anyway,
I put in a new o-ring and I now turn the gas cap by turning the cap from
the metal lip on the inside of the gas cap.  No more gas smell, anyway I
just thought I'd mention this since I noticed a few people had similar
problems and maybe it's the same cause.
