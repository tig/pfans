Well, it's raining, and my passenger side wading pool is back!  I just
bought
this car two weeks ago, so I'm new at this.  I read in the 944 FAQ that a
solution is to weld a new piece of metal into the battery tray at a cost of
about $500.  Is it possible to just use a replacement battery tray, or is
there some reason this won't work?  $15 looks a lot better than $500!
 Thanks!    ~~~~Lynn


I have had the same problem and here is how I repaired it. 

Battery Compartment Repair

Materials and Tools

Baking Soda
Galvanized sheet steel 
2 cans Plastic-Dip or similar liquid latex tool coating
drill
tin snips
pop rivet gun and rivets (preferred) or short sheet metal screws and
screwdriver
battery mat (most automotive parts stores carry these)

1.  Remove battery
2.  Clean battery compartment area thoroughly, neutralize acid remaining in
area with a solution of baking soda and water.
3.  Reclean area with clear water and dry thoroughly.
4.  Cut a piece of galvanized sheet steel to fit the bottom of the
compartment.
5.  Brush the bottom of the battery compartment with Plastic-Dip.
6.  Put galvanized steel into position and rivet or screw into place.  Be
careful when drilling holes that you do not drill into any components below
the battery compartment.  Especially if the car has air conditioning.  If
you use screws you must place them as far out as possible and in a position
where the battery will not rest on them.
7.  Pour remaining Plastic-Dip into compartment and brush up on the sides. 
Allow to dry for at least 12 hours, longer if possible.
8.  Pour in second can of plastic dip and repeat step 7.
9.  Make sure drain opening in the compartment is open so water can flow
out of the compartment.
10. Cut to fit and place battery mat into compartment.
11.  Replace battery and secure into position.

       This repair should last for a long time yet is inexpensive enough
that you can repeat it for as long as you own the car and never come close
to the $500.00 a body shop would charge.
