        Re - your questions:

        1. Anything to be done about the broken glove box door short of
buying a new one (which I probably            wouldn't do)?  What's broken
- hinges/straps ?
        If straps, lots of earlier postings detailing options for repairs -
 let me know
        and I'll dig them out for you.

        2. The plastic covering the instrument panel appears to be dirty
from the inside? Is there an easy way            to remove this for
cleaning?
        If you find out, let me know - I want to replace mine.

        3. My turn signals while all functioning appear to blink very fast.
Is this normal?
        Shouldn't be - look for blown bulb or replace flasher unit (cheap
common part)

        4. Has anybody purchased the shifter repair kit for $47 advertised
in the mags? If so is it worthwhile?
        Let me know (I'd like one too)

        5. Does anybody make a sunshade specifically for the 944?
        Can't answer

        6. I have looked at seven or eight Turbos and S2's. None of them
had
the front spoiler? My guess is            you can't keep one of them due to
the low clearance. Am I right?
        My S2 has full front (factory) air dam with black plastic tray
leading back which slides over any obstructions
        (i.e. parking stops etc) - what do you mean by spoiler ??

        7. My dash night lighting appears to be very dim when turned up as
high is it can be. Is this typical?
        Yep, absolutely - dim light from below means shadows etc from dial
needles - I live with it, but wouldn't
        mind a cheap easy fix if anyone has one.

        Great car, sorry to hear about the towing incident - I would guess
you're going to have to wear it, but a
        letter of demand tying the damage to the drop (quote a mechanic)
might get you something - but I doubt
        it.

        Maybe it's time for an S2 list - most of this one seems to be about
the 951's !!
