Okay folks,

        Here's one that I would like to hear some commentary on, because
firstly I didn't know this was a real "problem."  I have experienced the
same phenomenon and always dismissed it as wheel-hop (or axle-hop).  Aren't
these vibrations from the rear just oscillations of the axle as the tires
fight for traction under hard accleration?  I get them in 3rd gear over
bridge seams if I'm gunning the car too, and as soon as the tires hook up or
I lift off of the gas slightly, the vibrations disappear.  I can understand
why changing the shocks would affect the frequency of the oscillations, but
is there really anything that can be done to completely remedy this?
        On trucks, especially lifted pick-up trucks, I've seen shocks placed
on opposing sides of the rear axle to counter the powerful torquing of the
entire axle by the driveshaft at the differential.  I bet our cars' torque
can force one side (depending on which way our driveshafts spin) to raise,
which puts the tires at different levels of traction (and wheel-spin rates)
that will continue to oscillate as the axle corrects itself and exchanges
its bias to the other side and back again.  Perhaps the old-fashioned
"traction bars" used on muscle-car dragsters can help here.  I live with the
occasional vibration, but if it really bothers someone, I guess they could
try some other things to stiffen up the rear besides changing out the shocks:

        1) Stiffer torsion bars to limit amplitude of any hop
        2) Larger sway bars to counter any movement of axle

        Or maybe I am completely screwy and there is another, simpler fix to
this "problem?"  Like different tires?  I hope it's not because I'm pointing
my center caps toward my valve stems...  :)
