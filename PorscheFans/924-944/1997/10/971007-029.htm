I just got (1 month ago) a 1987 924S which has recently gained a little problem:

I was driving home today, and shortly before I arrived, my trans started making
grinding noises as I shifted into 2nd gear.  I ignored it and thought I just missed
pushing down the clutch far enough or something.  I got home, and noticed that my gas
was down near gone.  I did something, then since I was bored, decided to go get gas
(hey, it's always fun driving a porsche).  It was fine, until about the same strech
(funny coincidence) as before, it started grinding again.  I made the second to last
turn, and the trasmission just went wacky.  Now, if I try hard, I can get it into the
top three gears (1, 3, 5), but not really into the bottom three (2, 4, R).  The shift
knob moves very erratically, and I need to drive the thing!  Does anyone have any
idea what is wrong?
Please help me, I need it!
