Hello P-Fans
    Thought I'd tap into some thoughts about AutoThority's (APE)  Mass Air
Flow Sensor. I have an '86 951 with APE's stage II kit 275 HP and a test
pipe.  I heard that the APE mass air flow sensor has a poor idle, and
sometimes does not perform as well (from day to day) as stage II chips. I've
also heard that a mass airflow meter needs some calm/dead space between the
air intake K&N cone - and the high turbuant air pressure zone. The APE kit
mounts the K&N cone right behind the left headlight, and there just is not
enough phisical space to smooth out the air flow/pressure.
    Any sugestions on what is my next step for a power upgrade? 

    I also have been thinking about replacing the header pannel between the
two headlights. Mine has been damaged and AIR makes a neat ram air induction
pannel. Has any one installed one. Does it cool the inter cooler any better?
 In Up-Fixin Vol 7, page 20, there is a chart measuring the temperture drop
accross the iner cooler from 50 MPH - 175 MPH. The charged temperture drop
stayed steady (about 20' C drop) untill 150 MPH!  So how much better can two
slots along the leading edge of the bumper - cool the inter cooler any
better?  What do you guys think? 

   										Thanks,  David Jalali
