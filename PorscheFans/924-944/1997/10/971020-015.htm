Hello Fans,

Plug Wires:
I downloaded the Magnecor catalog onto my
computer.  There is a lot of info.  The question I have
for those who bought wire from Magnecor is,  am I
going to have to supply them with the type, style,
length, etc... of the plug wires or is it as simple as
giving them the year and make of the car and they will
supply the perfect match?

Dash Covers:
Has anybody tried the standard cloth dash covers that
just lay over and velcro to the dash?  I've also heard
that the plastic caps are rather dissatisfying.

Instrument Cluster Illumination:
I removed the instrument cluster this weekend and
inspected all the bulbs for cleanliness and use.  They
were all pretty dirty but not one of them need to be
changed due to "burnt" glass.  If I were to replace
every bulb in the cluster, the bill would have been over
$50 which I decided wasn't worth since they were just
dirty

I  noticed a slight difference in intensity
but my no means did I see the change that some list
members found (I believe somebody said they
actually had to use the dimmer switch to reduce the
brightness!)  The three 2W bulbs which are
responsible for illuminating the cluster, in my opinion
are not cut for it -- to small wattage for what it has to
do.    I'm used to the instrument cluster in my Ford
Explorer but Ford, unlike Porsche, place bulbs behind
the gauges which shine THROUGH the gauges. 
Porsche has 3, 2W bulbs that shine ON the gauges --
big difference.  

What I got out of removing the instrument cluster was
(1) now I know how to replace a bad bulb and (2) it
exposes a lot  of stuff under the dash which is good
information for future troubleshooting.

Happy motoring!
