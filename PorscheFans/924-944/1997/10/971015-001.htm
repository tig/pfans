Yes, this is the famous oil pressure relief valve.

I would replace the relief valve and the oil cooler housing if I were
you,
also when reinstalling everything make sure everything is exactly
ligned up. This will probably cost you a couple of $100. Maybe 
George B. can help you with a used oil cooler housing.

Get the Porsche 924-944-928 parts and technical reference catalog
(PNA 000-147A) it has a technical bulletin in it which deals with 
the oil cooler housing and pressure relief valve.

Good luck,
