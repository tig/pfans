hey all,

just some assorted stuff  i've been brewing while my 924 is out of service
receiving a new head, a little suspension tuning , and alot of wallet
draining...

after removing the head from my donor car i found that the gasket was blown
out between the third and fourth cylinders, out to machine shop it went to be
rebuilt and straightened , and now, welded. i've seen this done on other
cars, do the p-cars usually hold?? im told a hairline crack was found, and
that its not uncommon, is this true?
as a result of the above, ive decided to employ the same crew to replace the
head on my "good" 924, i figure if something goes wrong, i can ligitimately
hold them accountable and the "you did it when you put it in" excuse wont
hold water (like my passenger side floors do...)
so , next topic is the ole battery tray problem that most of us have. i used
a plastic bag and two cans of rubber undercoating (a bargin at 99 cents each)
which held for about three months, but i still need to fix it "right".  as
i've seen lately many have covered it up , but wont it continue to decay?
does the battery acid simply make the metal brittle, or is this a rust
problem? im thinking its rust, and i want it out of my car, so maybe cut it
out and use a fibreglass patch will do the trick?? idea's anyone??
i'm replacing my endlinks with porsche factory replacement parts, with the
bump, clunk, clunk, gone tires will be my next improvement. ive seen many
debates on the list, but none seem to apply to my needs, daily driver, all
year around and able to take the twisties well when i get the urge to brave
the city traffic and venture off to the mountains of the catskills once in a
while.  whats the opinion on size/brand of tires to go on stock 924 rims for
these purposes? im also considering summer/winter sets of tires.
true porsche loyalist skip this section, my flame suit is on, the question is
on seats, what other auto brand seats will fit nicely, p-seats are hard to
find and ive got 2 sets of poor ones. will (here it comes) conquest tsi seats
fit well? maybe (again) mustang seats?  as i roll away smothering flames.....

thanks in advance for the help,

but oh what fun. :)
