Greg,
     Don't put up with that #$%^ from the shop. If they didn't work on the 
line going from the clutch master cylinder to the slave cylinder, than they 
didn't replace the master or slave which they already charged you for. I would 
highly suspect they damaged the said hydraulic line while they were doing the 
work. It would have been very easy for them to damage the line when they were 
replacing the master cylinder as it is not easy to access (speaking from 
experience). Demand to see the broken line, if they can't produce it, insist 
that they replace it free of charge. It also sounds like they are over 
charging you for the work. The master and slave cylinder can be bought for < 
$100 (OEM parts). It shouldn't have taken them more than 2-3 hours, (took me 
about two for the master cylinder if you don't count the time I was trying to 
bleed the damn thing). don't put up with their crap..
Good Luck,
   Ezra
