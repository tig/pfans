Hello P-fans.  Thought I'd contribute a bit instead of always asking.  A genius
on this list (you know who you are) suggested putting 8" subs in the cubby holes
in the back, instead of the Bazooka's.  More so for the challenge and the 'I did
it myself' fame and fortune, I decided to do just that.  I made a template out
of cardboard, then cut plates out of 3/4 paraply that fit in the cubby's quite
nicely.  For the amplifier placement, I struggled a bit, but finally located it
under the plate in the drivers side cubby.  This puts it completely out of the
way, hidden and secure.  Air flow isn't great, but I did a heat check yesterday,
and it's not getting hot (Alpine 80x2).  I initially installed two MTX brand 8"
subs, which made the system sound pretty decent, but a friend talked me into
trying the Fosgate Punches.  WHAT a difference.  The Fosgates throw SO much more
bass I had to turn down the bass on the head unit, which had another nice side
effect.  It cleared the bass off the 4x6's which made them sound much better
too.  Now the system sounds great, and I'm enjoying the car even more.  A
curious thief can only see the the stock components and I've lost no cargo
space.  Oh, and 'I did it myself'   :)
