I just purchased the 6 piece roller & belt kit from PAR for $119, but 
with the recent thread about Porsche revising the part to a wider belt 
(???), I decided for $16 it couldn't hurt to purchase the camshaft belt 
from my local dealer. Well, the Porsche (Gates OEM) camshaft belt is no 
wider than the Goodyear aftermarket belt found in the kit. However, the 
Gates belt those feel slightly beefier and looks to be of better 
construction. The aftermarket 6 piece kit is a good value, but the $16 
OEM camshaft belt is cheap insurance.
