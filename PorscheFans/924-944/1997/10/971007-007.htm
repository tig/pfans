I bought my first P-car ('83 944) new, even ordered it from the factory
equipped the way I wanted it.  Kept it for over 9 years, 65k miles, and I
didn't put more than approximately $2000 into it outside of normal
maintenance and/or slight safety mods.  I would say that considering all of
the autocrosses and drivers ed events I participated in over that time,
$225/year indicates a high degree of reliability.  You should understand,
however, that my normal maintenance included oil changes and brake
pad/fluid changes at a more frequent pace than the factory maintenance
schedule called for.  There will always be "trade-offs" between what is
considered "normal" and what you feel is right for you and your car.
BTW, that car is still around our region, but is finally getting some
"high-priced" repairs (thank goodness it isn't me paying for them).  All
cars get old, but those kept up from the beginning just do it at a slower
pace.
