(My apologies if you see multiple copies of this post. I keep getting error
messages.)

I've just bought a 944S2 with the factory LSD. I'm going to do Solo I and
II, lapping days, driver's education events, and maybe some club races. So...

When I jack up the rear end and spin one wheel by hand, the other follows
in the same direction as expected. However, with a bit of effort I can also
turn one wheel and hold the other wheel still.

Is this normal? The manual indicates 10-35Nm is the additional force on a
bench (page 39-122f). My "bit of effort" above is around 10Nm, I'm
guessing. I'm not sure if the bench figure applies, in any case.

My only experience with LSD's is with Detroit Lockers, and when they
engaged, both wheels were tied together. Period. :-)

Secondly, any recommendations as to transaxle lube? On my 924S (non-LSD),
changing the lube to the unobtanium-ultra-expensive-european-Shell lube
imported by the factory for use in the Rothman's 944 Turbo Cup series made
quite a bit of difference in shifting and noise levels. However that series
and that lube are both long gone from Canada. So... the factory says 75W90
GL-5 or 80 GL-4. The mail-order places like Swepco 201 or Redline... and
which Redline? There's "shockproof" (light, heavy, superlight), 75w90, MTL,
75w90NS (which sounds interesting for racing because it increases lockup,
but with what side effects on wear/reliability?) Ack! I'm not a boy-racer,
I don't want to sacrifice reliability for less friction. 
 
Finally, the 924/944 transaxle seems to run hot, and the S2 doesn't have
the trans oil cooler that the 944 turbo has. Is this an easy/worthwhile
mod? (No doubt with my luck it is worthwhile and not easy or cheap, or easy
and not worth it :-) I see from the spec books the factory put them on S2's
destined for Switzerland, but the 944 manual doesn't show the setup...

Thanks in advance for any response,
Craig.

Looking for a cheap tow vehicle/winter beater... Hmmm. Maybe the 924S...
