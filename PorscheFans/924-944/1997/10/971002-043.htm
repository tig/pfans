Subject: Waterpump / belts

Hi All,

I checked out my anti-freeze leak and it wasn't a hose like I'd hoped.  It
seems to be coming from the timing belt case (or from behind it) so it
looks as though I have to replace the waterpump.  

Can anyone think of anything else I should be looking at or replacing while
I have that much of the car apart?

What type of gasket sealer is best to use for the waterpump?

When I lift the car to put it on jack stands, can I put a floor jack under
the aluminum cross member to raise the front of the car?

Is the Prestone anti-freeze in the silver bottle the right stuff - it says
phosphate and silcant free?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

TIA

Dear Tia & P-fans
    What type of gasket sealer is best to use for the waterpump? 
	I like using Permatex products, I think its called "aviation gasket
sealent".  I would use it only on one side of the gasket surface to "hold it
in place" durring assembly. I also believe that you could install the gasket
"dry" with out a sealant - as long as there are two machined surfaces. 
	As long as you have the cooling system "open" - I would also take the time
to replace any "weak" hoses. I would also replace the heater control valve &
rear heater core hoses - located above the clutch bell housing, rear of
engine.  AJ-USA also sells complete coolant hose kits: $73-119 (NA-951),
1-800-877-1911. 
	Any coolant that says "Phosphate-Free" is OK to use. I use
Volkswagen/Audi-Coolant part#ZVW-237-105, $18/gal. Also "Seirra" or
"Quaker-State" anti-freeze is also OK to use.
	I would lift/support the car from the jack spots - just behind the front
wheels.  The bottom of the floor pan has a reinforced area - it kind of has a
inverted ramp, just behind the engine belly pan about 12 inches from the
sides of the car. Also there is a round reinforced area just behind each
front wheel about 6 inches back near the out side rocker edge. The aluminum
cross member i think would also be OK to support the car. 
				
				 Good Luck, David Jalali. '86 951
