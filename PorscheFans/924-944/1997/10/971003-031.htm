Hi Chuck
I replaced my waterpump and thermostat a few months ago (87 951 also) The
old thermostat said 80C but the dealer only had 83C and 87C stats.  I
elected to use the 83C, which has bumped the gauge reading up -  just pass
the first hash mark.  The old stat kept the needle just below this first
hash mark.  That is the only discernible difference, other than it opening
3 degrees later, I imagine.  You should however make sure they give you the
correct stat and spacer for the new waterpump, since the later pumps have
the groove for the retaining ring at 7mm from the shoulder as opposed to
the old which was 4.5mm from said shoulder. I personally have not come
across a 71C stat.  Perhaps George B. can enlighten us.
