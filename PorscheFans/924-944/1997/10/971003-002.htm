I have been reading all the comments on Vertex and I like to
add my experiences. I have ordered twice from them (I am in
the Netherlands, Europe) so if anything would have gone
wrong I would have had much trouble. I spent about $1500
with them and I found their service very good and the parts
were excellent. Original Bosch electrical parts, original
Porsche motor mounts, german brand water pump,
original german Elring gasket sets, original Sachs clutch
parts etc. etc.

I do not order nickel and dime stuff from them (that doesn't 
make sense from the Netherlands) and I always save up
so that I order a large number of parts at the same time,
this reduces shipping costs.

All in all my experiences with them have been very good.
They sell the 924-944-928 parts and technical reference manual 
for about $10 which is also quite good.
