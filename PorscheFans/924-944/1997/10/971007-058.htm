Subject: hard starting S2


Folks,

Need some diagnostic help.  Car is 90 944 S2 with 58k mi.
Recently had 60k service - at which time the mechanic also
"adjusted the mixture".  The next day the car took two tries
to start.  Starting problem exists only after car sits overnight -
i.e. DEAD COLD.

Took it back to the shop, and the mechanic said the starter
was drawing excessive current.  I pulled the starter, took
it to an auto electricals place who pronounced it fine, but
replaced brushes and relubed for me.  Re-mounted the starter
and car turned over very sluggishly -- had to jump it to get
it started.

Went to Sears, old battery tested low voltage under high current
drain (simulated starting).  Replaced the battery.  Starter
cranks quicker.  This morning, after sitting overnight, again
took two cranks to get it started, though the starter/battery
sounds quick and healthy.

Any ideas?

Electrical:  I'd like to check the ground straps.  Where are they?

Fuel system:  I'm suspicious since the problem first appeared after
the mechanic reset the fuel mixture.  Where is the adjustment -- I'd
like to return it to stock setting.  Also, since the 60k mi service
included a fuel filter, I'm wondering if there's some problem resulting
from opening the fuel system.

Thanks in advance

Dear Todd
	I would take you car back to the repair shop that did the service on the
car. Have the CO% checked AND Adjusted! The CO% should be in the 0.5-1.5% CO.
The higher the % number the richer the fuel mixture. You need to have the
fuel mixture adjusted with and emission machine - you can not adjust it
"blind" ei by your self. If you are disgusted with the shop that did the 60K,
go to a dealer or independent, they should only charge 1hr's of labor aprox
$65. If you realy want to try your hand the mixture set screw is located on
the air flow meter box, 3 mm alen screw. Make the adjustment when the engine
is fully warmed up, idling, turn the screw clock wise aprox 1/2 to1 turn.
Turn the car off and retest the cold start 5 hours latter.
	I doubt the fuel filter is causing your cold start problem. either the fuel
filter is clogged or it flows fuel! 

						Good Luck, David Jalali
