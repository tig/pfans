VAUGHAN, I make sure my wife takes the Porsche when she goes out for
coffee with her girlfriends. It seems inevitable that the guys want to
see who the blonds are that are driving a black turbo S. She loves the
attention, its makes her feel single or something like that. She also
loves the fact that there is a button (gas pedal actually) that makes
them all disappear whenever she wants.
