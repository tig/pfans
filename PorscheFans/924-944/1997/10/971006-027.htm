All 951's I've driven or been passenger in have done that and as you
know, there are a lot of 951's I've been in :)  The lower the car is,
the more pronounced the vibration and the softer the rear shocks,
the more pronounced the vibration.  My gut feeling is that it is
the rear shocks getting on the bump stops under hard acceleration
and transmitting the road vibrations through the bump stop and into
the cabin area.  If you're car squats a lot, then that is likely
the cause.  Getting on the bump stops BTW is not a bad thing on this
car as it is quite long and soft (probably designed to be like an
adjustable progressive rate spring).  The reason why it goes away
after you've had the car in the air is because the shocks haven't settled
back down yet.
