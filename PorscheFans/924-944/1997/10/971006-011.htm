Hey,

Well I finally put my 951 in the paper Sunday.  First guy that called =
came and saw it and in 30 minutes bought it on the spot.  I was a little =
teary eyed watching him drive it away.  My wife was sadder than I was.

Just writing to thank everyone on the list who has given me advice and =
has put up with my rambling writings.  This list is the best friend a =
Porsche owner could have.  I would like to thank in particular:

George B. - The best parts/technical guy around.  And a very nice =
gentleman.

Jim Richmond - The biggest 944/951 fan ever.  Jim, you ain't right.  =
Thanks for all the writings and advice.

Doug Donsbach - Thanks for all the tire and suspension info you've given =
in the past.  You are a *very* helpful list member.

And last but not least -

Farzaan Kassam - The crazed speed demon of the list.  Your stories of =
you 951 exploits have me convinced that the 951 is one tough and =
reliable car!  Good luck on your future racing endevours!

And one other non-list member -

Chris Cervelli - He races POC/PCA 951s and is now racing GTS-2 ( I think =
).  Heard he just had a bad wreck at Pikes Peak, but is OK.  A great 951 =
advice giver and a super person.  If you're thinking about modifying =
your 951 for racing or maximum performance, give Chris a call at =
AutoHaus.  Thanks Chris for you help and advice. And good luck in the =
future! =20

I'l still be hanging around, interjecting my advice/opinion for what =
it's worth.  Once I get this house built, I'm on the prowl for another =
951.

A PorscheFan forever,

J. Dean Roberson
Wasn't complete until I got married, now I'm finished.
