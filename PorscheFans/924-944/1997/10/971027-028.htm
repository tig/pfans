Front suspension:

The '88 944 Turbo S and the '89 944 Turbo had special single-adjustable
(rebound) Koni sport shocks.  These differed from the standard Turbo's sport
shocks in two important ways: they were valved more aggressively (i.e,
"stiffer"), and they did not have a welded-on lower spring perch.  Instead,
the cars came with racing-style adjustable perches.

Porsche built some of the special racing cars (e.g., Rothmans Cup cars,
Escort Series cars) with a similar set-up, but instead used double-adjustable
Koni shocks (bump and rebound adjustment).

Some of the racing cars used Bilstein coil-overs instead of Konis.

Anyway, I have some original '89 Turbo front struts that I use in the
off-season, while using a set of the racing double-adjustable parts for AX
and track events.  I bought the latter at a swap meet for $20@, and had them
rebuilt by Truechoice in Hilliard, OH.  They are available as brand new
parts, but I've heard that they are $300-400 or more, each.  You can have
Truechoice convert single-adjustable Koni sport shocks to double-adjustable
units and have the valving changed if you so desire.  This applies to either
the Turbo S-style struts or the standard Turbo-style.  You can also use an
adjustable spring perch and 2 1/2 diameter standard sized racing springs on
the standard Turbo-style Konis.

The Turbo S struts which I have are not for sale at this time--  I like
having a spare set.

Those intested in the parts referred to in my previous posts (brakes, wheels,
etc.), must contact the parts owner, Mark at (415) 491-4843 for prices.  (Bay
Area).
