	I think I also have to add a few more things... this was
my first car, and also my first accident (as I said ~29 days after I bought
it).  I never did get the guy who hit me's insurance comp.  My insurance
comp. was the one I was dealing with.  I was also at zero fault in the 
accident. I tried calling my insurance adjuster a few times, even threatened
taking him to court (he called my bluff) and said some mumbo-jumbo crap about
how his book value was what all insurance people were using and so forth,
i can't even remember half the BS he told me.  So I went to my car dealer and
had him give me the book value for the car I just bought.  Book value was more
than what I had paid for it.  So I went back to the insurance guy --and you
guessed it, same thing.  He pretty much said that it didn't matter I had the
car for only 29 days - and even when questioning him about how a car could
go down in value of over $1000 in less than a month, he said nothing he 
could do.

	I didn't have this mailing list, and really didn't have any source
to turn to for help.  I had already been having my friend drive me to
work for over a half month, and my friend wasn't going to be happy to do so
indefinately.  With no end in sight, I signed their forms so I could get
my $6,900 check for my car I paid $9100 on.
