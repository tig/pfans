First of all let me say that I have found this list to be very helpful!  I
purchased an '87 944 earlier this year and have had a fantastic time with it
this spring/summer.  I am an avid road race fan and have admired Porsche's
(especially 944's) for years.  I had to replace the A/C compressor but other
than that my 944 didn't have any hidden gotchas.  I'm getting ready to put
it away for the winter (I live in Ohio where salt encrusted roads dominate
the winter months) and need to straighten out a few things:

1) One of the arms that raises the sun roof is no longer working.  One side
works, one doesn't.  Is this something I can handle myself or is it a major
job to "get in there"?  If anyone has fought this battle I would appreciate
any advice.

2) The rear deck lid occasionally spontaneously opens by itself.

3) The A/C switch on the dash is going bad in that I have to depress it
several times, hold it down, etc. before it will shut off.  Turning the A/C
on doesn't seem to be a problem.

4) The dash indicator for the gear selector doesn't light up (yes believe it
or not my 944 is an automatic!)  This is a minor annoyance at night.

TIA.......
