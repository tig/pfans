Well hell I'm a banker so here's a favor:

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXCEPT THEIR OFFER!!! Most people I know who have totaled
a car or their car was stolen were happy with the settlement. THEY provided
what the value of the car was, not what the blue book value is. You had a
record of sale, they need to honor that. THEY had adds showing what the real
prices are. If you provided back up ie: pano/excellence adds, you will get
paid. You are also going to get the sales tax on the settlement amount. A
friend of mine suck his '88 951 in the woods at a DE and he got over 20K for
the car, his car was nice but it wasn't perfect, and it wasn't an S model.
Also if you settle for 10K and the sales tax is 8% you get $10,800.00. Now
about the cost of going to court...everyone knows it's the lawyers who .......
