Ok, well here's my newest concern.  First thing in the morning, when I start the
car I get a really rough idle for about 3 seconds and white smoke from the
exhaust for about 15 seconds.  If I rev it up it belches it out quicker, but
looks like a cloud.  It stops when the engine is warm and doesn't seem to smoke
at all except on a cold startup.  If I put my hand near the exhaust when it's
doing this, my hand gets the sooty residue on it (none when the engine is warm),
which doesn't feel oily at all.  It seems more like water.    Also have brown
residue floating in the coolant tank (loses coolant at a rate of about a quart
per week).  It also seems to be losing oil.  So here are the things I think it
could be and would like input from other, more knowledgable P-fans.

1)  A blown head gasket which allows coolant into one of the combustion chambers
when the engine is cool, but seals when the engine is warm.
2)  Bad seals in the oil cooler, which allows water in the oil that burns off
when the engine is run (not sure this one makes sense to me, because wouldn't it
smoke all the time?)
3)  Cracked (ohgod dare I say it?) head, that seals when the heat expands the
metal.

Ok, none of that would be good news, but are there any other possibilities?  How
can I narrow it down to what is actually wrong?

Thanks Pfans, and what ever happened to our shirts?
