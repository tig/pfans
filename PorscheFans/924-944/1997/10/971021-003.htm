With regards to brightness, I suppose it is just what you're used to having.  
Most dash lighting seems a bit dim to me.  Most of my driving is urban 
with a lot of light pollution and a lot of oncoming traffic.  So, for me, 
brighter lights would be nice.

I did pull the dash and clean all the bulbs on my 88 951.  I don't know if 
you have to pull the steering wheel but I did anyway.  It definitely makes 
things easier.  Disconnect the battery first and wait 1/2 hour to "safe" the 
air bags.  Takes a T45 Torx I think, to pull the airbag. 24mm nut for the 
steering wheel, no puller.   Having done it a couple of times, I can pull the 
whole thing in less than 10 minutes.  3 positive locking connectors for the 
wiring.  Just undo them.  They are keyed so they can't be installed wrong 
and it's easier to pull and clean bulbs if you can take it in the house.  It did 
brighten up the dash a bit but only a bit.  Can't say that it's really 
worthwhile but it's not hard.  Watch out for the tripmeter reset, mine 
keeps popping out when I reinstall the dash.  Next time I'll REALLY put 
a dab of silicon behind it like I said I was going to do last time.

With all the back and forth about problems associated with higher wattage 
bulbs, I didn't even look for any.  It's probably worth browsing the 
schematic to see who sources the bulbs.  I'd be a little leery of changing 
some of the telltales but it seems like stepping the 3 main bulbs from 2 to 
3 watt "shouldn't" be a problem (250 milliamps more draw).
