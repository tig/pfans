AHHHHHHH!!!!! Im so frustrated, I dont know what to do.
Surely someone out there has gone through what Im going =

through!! My 86 944T is still in the shop waiting on a #2-3 exst.-
manifold..Ive bought 2 so far, and they both leaked. I cant and
wont pay $800-1000 for a new piece of metal 1-foot long, its
absurd. AutomobileAtlanta doesnt even have any, hardly
anyone ever has the part in stock, and they always leak...
Does anyone have any suggestions? As of right now Im going
to have to remove the heat shield and have the part welded, knowing
that it will leak again in a couple of months....
        Also, There is a scraping/grinding noise coming from the =

left side of the engine compartment when someone gets out of the =

passenger side door, or going around a corner, steering, or suspension??
        Thanks Everyone for listening to me gripe,
Sam Grant
86-951- all new brakes, fuel pump, and still waiting on fuel lines and
an answer to the manifold...2000 miles and counting on an engine rbld.
ps..Extremely Sorry for the long message!!!
On what other car would a person spend so much money on????
