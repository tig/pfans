David,

Check the three NTC-resistors that measure the outside, inside and mixed
air temperatures.
The outside NTC is located under the hood under the plastic cover at the
right side of the car just in front of the fresh air inlet. Should
measure 22 Kohm at 20 degrees Celsius.
The inside NTC is a little more difficult to get to.
It is located behind the glovebox. There is a small motor/fan unit that
sucks air from the passenger compartiment. (Next to the cigarette
lighter is the intake) Should measure 10Kohm. The NTC easily becomes
dirty with dust, cleaning might help.
The mixed air NTC is located behind the fresh air outlet in the middle
of the dash. Remove the plastic part (around the instruments and the
air-vents) and you see the NTC. This one also should measure 10Kohms.
The NTC's can be tested by holding one between your fingers, the
resistance should drop.
With some patience they can be replaced by one you can buy at an
electronics-store. I did, and the NTC's work just fine for over a year
now.

On my car (model '88 944NA) the servo for the hot/cold air mixture was
also faulty. The @&%$#* thing is hard to reach, but once you take it
apart, look at the solderingjoints. The may be cracked. Desolder the and
resolder the joints. It took away the intermittend fault on my car.

Feel free to mail direct in case of questions.

See ya, Rudy Koskamp.
