I have copied a previous listmembers storage procedure for your
information.  I have stored my cars using the procedure without any ill
effects.  I store my cars in an unheated garage and the temps go down to
minus 40C (minus 40F, since the two scales meet at this point)  I always
remove the battery and store it in my heated basement in a clear (open)
plastic bag and in a visible location so I can keep an eye on it.  It has
always retained almost full charge even though I charge it before
re-installation.  I also drive, and park the car on a sheet of 4 or 6 mil
plastic in case there are leaks and also if the floor sends up moisture to
the underside of my car. My tire pressures are increased to about 40lbs.  I
change the oil (use fresh cheap dino, quality oil) just prior to storing to
prevent acid attack and I drain prior to putting car back on the road - for
which I use synthetic. I also disconnect the coil from the distributor and
crank the engine to prime up the oil pressure before actually starting the
car.  Hope this helps.  

Winter Storage

From: fredschw@execpc.com (Fred Schwierske)

Peter,  Local, well respected P mechanic passed on the following winter
instruction list. He recommended NOT starting the car (i.e.: in the garage)
unless you drive it long enough (20 miles) to insure complete warm-up.
Not sure of the list origin, perhaps the local chapter of PCA?  Items seem
to make good sense.  I'm sure others will have additional comments.

1)	Wash & wax the car prior to the day you intend to store it, then drive
the car a little in order to help evacuate water from brakes, nooks, &
crannies.
2)	Apply leather treatment to all leather to prevent drying and cracking.
3)	Fluids:
a.)	change the oil and filter.
b.)	check windshield washer fluid - be sure it is winterized with antifreeze.
c.)	add StaBil to fuel tank (run engine afterwards) & top off fuel tank.
d.)	if water cooled - check antifreeze strength.
4)	For annual storage suspension on blocks is NOT recommended as the shock
absorber pistons are fully extended and can corrode & stick.
5)	Inflate tires to 8 psi. above the maximum rating on the tire to avoid
flat spotting.
6)	Lube electric antenna mast with thin oil and retract.
7)	Disconnect and remove battery or pull fuse of clock and burglar alarm to
prevent battery drainage; pulled batteries should be stored in a cool, dry
place OFF of the floor, preferably on a piece of wool ... slow charge in
mid-winter every several months (Personally I've had good luck with small
Schumacher 1 Amp smart charger which charges only when battery voltage
begins to fall - about $25.).
8)	Lube door, hood, trunk and targa rubber seals with silicone spray.
Close doors, hood, and trunk to FIRST LOCK position so that seals are
relaxed.  Be sure hood and interior door lights are not on.
9)	Place small wood blocks under wiper arms so blades are off glass.
10)	If high humidity conditions are expected, leave a desiccant bag in the
car.
11)	Close the heater flaps on rear engine cars to prevent rodent entry.
12)	Seal intakes and exhaust pipe with tape or towels.
13)	Relax targa tops.
14)	If exposed to direct sunlight, cover glass to protect interior.
15)	Park vehicle on large sheet of plastic to prevent ground moisture from
attacking underbody.
16)	Cover with a QUALITY car cover which will allow humidity & moisture
passage.
17)	Do NOT set handbrake.
18)	Say Goodbye ....
