Well, this has taken a lot of time to get right, the front wheel shimmy is 
finally gone! Here is a brief history of what I did. I plan to write up a 
section suitable for the FAQ on wheel shimmy after some time enjoying the new 
smooth ride....

Vehicle: '85.5 (DMV calls it an '86) Guards red 944, 235Kmiles, '87 engine

Oct. 96 
  - Bought car, very bad front end shimmy, M+S 225/50R15's front and rear
Nov. 96 
  - replaced front tires with Dunlop D40M2's, 225/50R15, wheel shimmy better
Winter/Spring '97 
  - replaced bearings, tie rod ends, rebuilt A-Arms, replaced rotors/pads,
    4wheel alignment, wheel shimmy better but D40M2's unevenly worn from 
driving
    before replacing the above.
June '97
  - Swapped D40M2's to rear, replaced front tires with Pirelli P700z's, 
205/50R15
    Wheel shimmy worst, wheels damaged from Tire Shop, suspect defective 
P700z's, Wheels
    shipped to Rennsport for repairs at tire shops expense (Vermont Tire)
Late July '97
  - Receive wheels back from Rennsport, look perfect. Place P700z's on front, 
    new Bridgstone Potenza RE71's on rear 225/50R15 at Porsche Dealer, still 
have shimmy
August '97
  - Have wheels re-balanced at Porsche Dealer free of charge, all 4 were out 
of balance,
    they re-balance, shimmy is better but front tires are finally deemed to be 
defective,
    order replacement RE71's for front, 205/55R15 to match rear tire radius
Late Sept '97
  - Have Porsche dealer install new RE71's on front, wheel shimmy finally 
fixed, but damage
    done to front wheels. Porsche dealer takes wheels for 2 days to fix 
damage, not as good
    as from Rennsport, but marginally acceptable. (PCNA notified of damage to 
wheels). Wheel
    shimmy back, suspect balance again. 
Today, Oct 16th
  - Porsche dealer re-balances front wheels free of charge, right wheel was 
off by 20grams,
    wheel shimmy gone again. Still awaiting UPS pickup of P700z's for return 
to TireRack.

What a pain! I still do all service on the car that I possibly can, no one 
else cares as much about a car than its owner, even those fancy Porsche 
Dealers (Yes, the one here in Vt. called AutoMaster has plush leather couches, 
fancy memorabilia, etc..) don't seem to give Porsche's correct treatment. 
Perhaps they spend too much money on their customer service representatives 
and fancy buildings and not enough on their mechanics... They do have the 
correct equipment ($15,000 non-contact tire changer, etc..), but service BMW, 
Mercedes, Honda, etc. Maybe they are not specialized enough?

Now that these tires are properly mounted, I would like them to last. I drive 
the car fairly hard, so when I say last I want them to wear evenly. What 
should the tire pressures be? I guess I need a pyrometer to properly determine 
that, but what about some general guidelines? Instructions for the car say 
29PSI front, 34PSI rear. However, the tires have markings saying 44PSI max, 
should the tire pressures be higher than recommended by Porsche? In various 
high performance driving books, I have read recommendations to inflate to max 
allowed pressure for the tires (even a couple of PSI higher) to reduce 
rollover. Is that really necessary with lower profile tires? I will mark the 
sidewalls and corner at the max to determine rollover, anything else I can do 
without a pyrometer?

Thanks,
       Ezra
