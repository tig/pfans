Well written!  In our PCA region here in Canada West, we recently had
a terrible blow to our Porsche ownership pride.  I DO NOT participate in
local PCA events after a horrible first time impression both Paul and
I received at a local PCA Karting event.  We were basically excluded from
the championship even though Paul and I were in first and second place
of the semi's.  The decent members were very apologetic, but cleaning
our wheels with toothbrushes is not our thing.  We fully respect the
people for which it is their thing, it's just not ours and our region
seems to spend more time brushing their wheels than their teeth (ouch!)

Anyhow, we have this beautiful stretch of road from Vancouver to Whistler
(the ski resort area).  It's a twisty section of road with elevation changes,
mid corner camber changes, just the stuff that makes 911 drivers cringe
and 944 drivers smile broadley.  The road, I feel is one of the best
designed and best speed limited stretches of road in B.C.  The engineers
who set the speed limits did so in such a way that driving at speed limit
is still invigorating(sp?).  Well, every year, the local PCA guys have
a dinner/concours/auto-x up at Whistler.

Now, a little more background on this road.  The local residents along
the highway have had it with drunk drivers returning from Whistler
or heading up, crashing into and killing their children and families
who use this road for daily transportation, rather than thrill seeking.
The local police of course have tried to crack down on these drivers
of death.  Personally, I enjoy driving the road at the speed limit
and sometimes even UNDER it when it's raining, etc.  The view is
stunning when clear (water on one side, mountains on the other).
The roar of the 951 exhaust in 2nd gear exiting a 100km/h corner under
WOT is awesome when heard next to a thick mountain wall.

On the way up to the PCA event, several drivers of Porsches were seen
by a local resident tailgating, excessively speeding (one guy was
estimated at 190km/h up the long stretch), passing on the left over
a double yellow line and the worst one possible (drivers should be
shot for this one as you have no idea what to do when someone does
this to you) passing on the right outside of the lane!  This lady
took the time to write to the local papers about this and it was
published in at least one paper.  The best point she made was that
she expected this from young sports car drivers, not greying old
guys driving their Porsches!

It was, and still is, an embarrassment and should serve notice to all
p-car drivers to be courteous, calm, and respectful of the other
drivers on the road.

The coolest thing I've ever done in my p-car was to stop and help a family
stranded on the side of the road in a beater pulling a motorhome
trailer thing.  I used my cell phone to call for a tow truck.  Later on,
the guy called me to say thanks, he was from out of town, heading to
a hockey game, they had driven 14 hours and their radiator hose had 
split.  He had been sitting there hoping someone would pull over for
over 1/2 hour.  The funny thing, they had the car towed to the hockey
rink to watch the Canucks game and made it just as the game was starting.
They stayed over night at the rink parking lot and fixed the hose in
the morning and headed back home.

His most memorable comment was how this shiny red Porsche pulled up,
the least likely car he expected to help them.  Perhaps we should
all learn from that comment.

Farzaan.
1989 Porsche 944 Turbo, age 22 (only 1 white hair and it's been pulled!).
