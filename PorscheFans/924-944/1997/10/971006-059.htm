 Porsche. >>

Doug,

Hear, hear!  It couldn't be said better!  I've wanted a 944 for a long time
and when my wife and I spotted this car one day she was all for getting it.
 We'd looked at others but had never seen one in this condition (for an older
model . . . . . it's a 1984).  When I started to object by saying that we
really didn't need the added expense of another car, she said "I can do extra
work to make the monthly payment"!  Well, how could I turn down an offer like
that?

Our cars are just like people . . . . . the better you respect and take care
of them, the better they respect and take care of you. 

Worth thinking about.
