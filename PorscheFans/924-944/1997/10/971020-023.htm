Since I own an S2, I hate to admit that they are pretty slow getting thru
the top end of the revs. They're sort of the inverse of the Turbo. But the
S2s will climb to 145 mph eventually. And while they are a bit slow at
higher revs, you'll find that you can do almost anything (passing, climbing
steep grades) in 5th w/out a downshift.

Regarding the narrow-band vibration, sounds like balance shaft timing. At
least that's the first thing to check. (Seem to be a lot of vibration
problems on the list these days).
