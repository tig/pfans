Michael, I know some people on the list have stated that the water pump can
be changed without removing the crankshaft pulley.  This may be true if you
bend the plastic rear belt cover down enough to gain access to the water
pump bolts.  I once made an attempt at doing it this way and then decided
against it.  (I think even changing the cam belt without removing the crank
pulley is poor practice since there is very little clearance between the
cam belt on the crank cog and the plastic cover and it would have taken
some real twisting and pushing to get the new one in there).  The plastic
cover makes access to the pump more difficult and it would require undue
risk of breaking the plastic in my opinion.  If you have access to a
flywheel lock then removing the crank pulley is an easy one man job
(provided you have a large breaker bar).  This does require removal of the
starter but that is a simple job on the 944.  What is more difficult, in my
opinion, is getting those balance shaft cogs off using the Haynes 2 punch
w/screwdriver method of holding the cog while you loosen bolt.  I would
highly recommend the proper tool for this job which is available from a few
Panorama suppliers.  Don't despair.....
