*** CAUTION *** Severe whining follows.

A little history.  When I took my car in for a tuneup, I mentioned that I had 
seen what looked like a little shiny wet spot on the rubber boot for the 
clutch master cylinder.  Without looking at anything, they say I need a 
new master cylinder.  Then he says, if you're replacing the master 
cylinder, you should replace the slave cylinder at the same time.  After 
consulting with the list, I say okay, go ahead.

When I got the car back, a grand later with tuneup :-( shop guy mentioned 
that they had to replace the line from the brake fluid reservoir to the 
master cylinder as it had been leaking.  Of course, at that point I start 
wondering if that $2 line had been the cause of the shiny wet spot but Oh 
well, at least now I have confidence in my clutch hydraulics.

That is, until I stepped on the clutch a couple weeks later and it went 
straight to the floor and stayed there.  After crawling around under the car 
and attempting to remove the starter bolts (which I firmly believe were 
torqued by an orangutang on PCP) I gave up and had it towed back to the 
shop before I broke something.

Of course, the shop now reports that the only piece which hasn't been 
replaced, the $100+ line between the master and slave cylinders has 
broken apart.  And they say that since they didn't work on that part, 
they're not responsible.  Now, from my point of view, IT WAS JUST A 
LITTLE SHINY SPOT!!!!  And, it was working fine.  And, I've already 
dropped close to $500 bucks and I'm not a happy camper.

So, finally, my question.  Am I just whining like a baby?  No, don't 
answer that.  Yes, I am but that's not my question.  What I'd like to have 
are some other opinions as I'm definitely biased.  While everything has 
been friendly, I'm wondering how far I have a right to push this.  I don't 
feel like these guys are out to screw me but I do feel like they are 
responsible for the damage.  

The only thing I can think of at this point is to ask them to see the original 
line tomorrow.  If I can clearly identify a twist or crimp, I'm going to push 
them to pay for most, if not all, of the cost.  On the other hand, if it's weak 
or corroded at the failure point, I'll take my lumps.  Any other input?

p.s.  I think I spend more days reading the list from the web archive 
interface than my mailbox lately :-)
