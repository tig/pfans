Great News!!!

I have fabricated a rubber jack pad for lifting the 924/944/968 series. 
When a pad is not used you could be damaging the SKS undercoating and the 
underside of the car! The pad which is fabricated from a hard rubber 
material will not damage the jack point areas or unnecessarily remove the 
protective SKS. It is very similiar to the factory pad that was used on 
the assembly line during production.
It is also designed to mate to the reccomended lifting points, avoiding 
any slipping that may occur during the lifting process. I have tested it 
several times and it insures a stable mount between the car and jack. It 
is much better then anything I have ever seen from any of the mail order 
companies. It will also work with the 951 model, not causing any damage 
to the lower plastic trim.

If anyone is interested I can be reached @ 609.645.8167  e-mail:
