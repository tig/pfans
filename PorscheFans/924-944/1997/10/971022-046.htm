I would never consider touching the timing belt.  The balance belt is the 
culprit in this case.

The balance shaft has no mechanical interaction with the timing drive
whatsoever, so if it does slip a tooth, the worse damage is a vibrating
engine and a ruined belt.  I do agree that a _broken_ balance shaft belt
could conceivably get caught between the timing belt and a roller/cog and
cause severe damage.

The current factory spec for a used belt is 2.0 +/- .3, so I had him set 
it to the loose side of the spec (1.8).  That change is so slight it made 
no difference in the noise, and after 3000 miles, it is not getting any 
better.

<Sigh>.

I can't believe these cars rolled out of the factory sounding like this.
