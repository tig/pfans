I have an 89 951 that was recently acquired with 90k miles...car is stock 
except for autothority s-2 chip...I want to autox this car and would like to 
get 8" rims all the way around and mount some sticky 245-45 16s.. A friend 
told me that this would allow me to rotate the frontand back tires as they 
tend to wear out on opposite sides of the tire. Has anyone done this? Can you 
recomend a light wgt forged wheel that is reasonably priced? Forgeline has 
some great looking lightweight wheels for under $400 each, but they come in 
7&9" widths, which blows my rotation  scheme.
Also is anyone using the shortshift kit as listed by Performance products, are 
they any good?

I just recently subscribed to porschefans and this is my first posting-what a 
great way to stay current. TIA.....Steve Strand ,  ex 914 and carrera cab ownr 
who has discovered the 951
