Hi Paul,

That was my 951 (though you didn't say if the toweye was red). 
Actually the bumper is the right size, but the PO must have been
in a accident and the nose piece was replaced with a 944 one, not
the 951 one. They (the 944's) are actually about an inch shorter and
don't quite follow the curve of the 951 bumper. Most people when
they look at the nose of the car get the feeling something is wrong
but can't quite put their finger on it. Maybe one day I'll replace it.
