The "Parts And Technical Reference Catalog" is a three ringed soft cover 
172 page book, which usually comes with an order over say $50.00 from a 
P-dealer. I think it is $7.50 if you purchase it alone. It is NOT a 
complete parts manual, it only contains maintainence items and several 
hundred parts w/numbers and several dozen drawings taken from the 
fiche.(it comes with a seperate price sheet). It is a real nice book, 
containing several tech tips and other useful information.

The "Illustrated Parts Catalog" is a picture book of MOST of the parts 
fiche drawings. It does not contain any parts decriptions or part 
numbers, just the reference numbers. It is contained in a grey 4 ring 
binder and is divided into the standard Porsche parts numbering system. 
Their is the other catalog in the same format: WET 614.900 which is for 
944 1989-91 ( I don't remember the price on this, but it is still 
available through PCNA.)


Note: The only way to get a complete parts list with drawings is to 
reference to the parts fiche for your particular model year. I copied the 
entire fiche and have the hard copy in (3) three ring binder notebooks in 
protective sleeves. 

Microfiche 944, 1983-85       WET 614.921
Microfiche 944, 1885-88       WET 614.321
Microfiche 944, 1989-91       WET 614.921
Microfiche 968, 1992-         WET 615.021

I hope that this clears things up.
Any questions? e-mail mikehr@earthlink.net
