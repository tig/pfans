The countinuing thread about rebuilt waterpumps is really not accurate.

No one, no matter how experienced, will ever treat a 944 or 951 water pump
R&R lightly.  Reputation, customer satisfaction, and good business practice
dictate that this repair goes the distance.  

I have installed both PCNA new pumps and quality rebuilt water pumps. After
many years and miles, I can state the my expericence with both has been good.
 When a customer insists on paying extra money for a new Porsche waterpump, I
offer my opinion and usually convince them to spend the money more wisely -
and go with a quality rebuilt. 

PCNA has a USA rebulider that rebuilds their pumps. This rebuilder and one
other do most of all the 944/951/928 water pumps.  In europe, the repair
parts for the water pumps are available as a kit for the garage to make the
repair. The shaft is pressed out, and new seal and bearing installed, pressed
back together, and that is that.  Rebuilding a starter or alternator is far
more complicated and more prone to failure. 

I believe there might have been some poor quality rebulilt water pumps out
there.  What is far more likely, is that some of us are doing this repair
without the belt gauge (see thread about belt noise, straight edge method,
and the wonderfull drill bit method of belt tensioning) , and putting too
much tension on the timing belt. In the past, when against my better
judgement, I have done belt/seal replacements without the obligatory water
pump replacement, within a 1000 miles, a weeping water pump was often the
result  (new belt putting correct tension on a old water pump). Belt tension
WILL effect waterpump life. 


J. Dean Roberston,  your are correct about Chris Cervelli, he has a very fast
400hp  951 racecar, races a 911 RSR in SportsCar (IMSA) and has recovered
from a severe wreck at Pikes Peak. However, Chris' shop is called Technodyne,
not Autohaus. 

Technodyne is Porsche shop located in Tempe AZ, which specializing in 951
performance.  Chris is a all around great guy, and very capable. If anyone on
the list would like to contact Chris for some service work, please email me
for his number. 

Best regards to my list buddies,
