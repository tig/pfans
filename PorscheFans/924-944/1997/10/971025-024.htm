Malcolm,

I also have an '87 944 auto. that had same messy leak problem that =
seemed impossible to nail down source. I discovered that the accelerator =
cable was too tight and the switch that sets all idling parameters for =
the car was not being activated (not sure if it's turning switch on or =
off). When cable was loosened, car ran smoother and the leak =
disappeared!!! In that I was getting my cheque book out for costly =
gasket replace game, I couldn't believe it!!!=20

Hope your leak is as easily solved.
