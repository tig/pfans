Darryl hi,

Intercooler for a 931, now there's a subject close to any 931 owners heart.

Here is what Ive found out so far,

i) Fit a 951 intercooler. You need to drop the radiator a few inch's and then
fit the 951 intercooler in the nose section infront of the rad. Lots of pipe
work is needed. On the down side with that much pipe work and a large 
intercooler you will have a longer time waiting for that boost.

ii) Find/buy/beg or steel a 924 Carrera intercooler which fits ontop of the
engine. Ive found a couple of places that will make one from a standard 
intercooler core. Good points. Less Pipes = less lag. Bad points you have to
do some body work and add a scoop to your bonnet to force the air over the
intercooler.

iii) Fit a charge cooler. Ive found a company over here in the UK who are
developing a charge cooler for the 931. Very much like a intercooler but it
uses a coolant to chill the intercooler. Adv. You can fit this anywher there
is space. Bad points it takes a small amount of Engine power to pump the
coolant.

If your thinking of one of these, you should consider some of the follow

O-ring your head allows your to run increased boost.
fit a better rad - lack of cooling kills ( It happend to me! :( ).
Replace your shells, the bottom end of the engine can take quite a beating. 

Im trying to compile a list of performance upgrades for the 931 so if you
know of any could you email me and let me know.

Best regards

        Richard.
