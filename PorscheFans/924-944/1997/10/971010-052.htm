Dear P-Fans
	Has anyone heard of, or used a product called: "No-Rosion"?  I first read
about it in "Circle Track Magazine" (I'm not into Nascar racing but this
magazine has - the best tech articles I've seen in print).   "No-Rosion" is a
product that you add to your coolant to stabilize the coolant: it also
neutralizes existing acids, prevents deposits and sludges from building up,
extends coolant life up to five years. "No-Rosion"  also has a PH indicator
that turns red when your coolant is to acidic! I've been using it for 1 year
now with no ill effects. 
	"No-Rosion" is made by ACS (Applied Chemical Specialties, Inc), their phone
number is 708-797-1699, they have a neat detailed information packet that
will explain everything you ever want to know about antifreeze/coolant. The
cost is $24 for 64 FL OZ that will treat 4 cars. I'm not affiliated with this
company - I just thought anyone with a water pumper would find this product
of interest. They even had a booth at Carlisle, Pa this year! 

						Sincerely, David Jalali
