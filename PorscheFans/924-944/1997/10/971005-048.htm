Subject: small power problem

Hey Porsche Pals,

Need some help/advice to diagnose the cause of my power loss problem.

Last night when I tried to start her there was no power at all.  Dead
battery.  So I had a friend give me a jump and I took a 35 minute drive
to recharge the battery before I went to the store.  Before I did my
errand I took her back home and shut her off to see if she would restart
(no sense trying that out in the middle of nowhere).  Sure enough she
fired right up just like normal.  I figured the battery wasn't getting
recharged because the hot cable was loose, which I tightened up before
the jump start.  OK, so I figured end of problem.  Wrong.

This morning I tried to start her and again she was dead.  No power at
all, not even enough to turn on an interior light.  Now I'm not so sure
that the problem was just a loose cable.  So I cleaned the terminals and
retighten the cable again and am charging her right now.

It can only be one of a couple of things.  Since she recharged herself
during the drive, the alternator has to be OK.  Otherwise, I would have
went nowhere.  Also, the battery is a 72 month type and its only been in
the car since July '95.  It's supposed to have another 4 years worth of
life.  (still it could be the battery).

Anybody have a similar problem or know of another cause for this total
loss of electrical power?  Oh, an important side note.  When I came home
last night and parked her, I remember looking at the clock in the car
and it read 9:35 pm.  The clock in the car this morning at 9:00 am read
11:40 pm (clock with hands not digital).  So that means that the battery
drained itself with no systems on in about two hours while parked. 
Weird huh?  (Maybe the "Visitors" took it for a spin and forgot to turn
the stereo off)  ;)   Anyway, I figure it has to be either the battery
simply won't hold a charge anymore or some kind of short is causing the
power drain.  Can't figure out how if that is the case, cause I made
sure everything was off.

Last clue, I just had her in on Wednesday to the mechanic to have the
cam belt retensioned.  Is it possible he accidently screwed something
up?

HELP.  TIA

Dear Rick & P-Fans

	I would probably suspect a bad battery. If you have a maint. free type
battery (sealed - no screw caps) this type of battery can only be discharge
once or twice before it is toast! The maint. type battery (with screw caps)
can be discharged many times 4-6 times with out killing the battery's ability
to hold a charge. If you battery is still covered by a warranty - get it
replaced! 
	I would also check for any electrical drains on the system. An easy way to
do so is to use a test lamp (12 Volts). Remove the battery's ground wire and
attach the test lamp between the negative post and the battery's  negative
wire. The test lamp should only be dimly lit - not bright! If it is bright
you have something in the electrical systems staying on! Make sure everything
is switch off, and start pulling fuses - one by one, to see which circuit the
short on! 
						Good Luck, David Jalali
