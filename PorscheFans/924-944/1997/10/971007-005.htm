	my roomate questioned p-car reliability and i have to say that i
am REALLY
	glad i have another car because mine is always broken or i am
fiddling with
	something. has anyone owned theirs since it was new?? if so how
reliable has
	it been??

	Matt,

		I have owned 2 944's the 1st was an '83 which went
90,000 miles, got a new water pump and rear wheel bearings and then
broke its seat when it hit the wall at Watkin Glenn in the mid 90's.
This brought in a new '87 which now has 113k, has had a new water pump,
and I have lost the belts twice (You would think I would have learned to
have them checked). I have replaced a motor mount, and am on my third
set of tires, second radio, and floor mats. Other than that it has been
flawless.

	Dan
