I had this problem and ithad to dowith two problems. FIrst of all there
are drains around the battery box and and around the fuse box that needs
to be cleaned of leaves and other debries frequently--like every six
months. If theses do not get cleaned then when it rains water gets
dirverted  to the heater/air conditionser box. When this happens it
needs to drain out of the air conditioner drain which is directly behind
the radio . THere is a tube from the airconditoiner drain to the
outside. In my case this tube was clogged and then water collected in
this chamber and when I made a left turn it would drain out of the the
tube that heats the clove box. and then drain onto the floor.

I have a 85.5 and I would think it is made the same way.
