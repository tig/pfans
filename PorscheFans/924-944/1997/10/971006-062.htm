i think it is great that all of your wives get involved with your porsches.
i hope my future wife is as enthusiastic (i am only 19 and my girlfriend of
2 years likes to work on it occasionally but i think i can really make her
get into it once she sees how much fun it can be.  not to mention she says
all of her friends cant help but be a little bit jealous!!).  what i really
wanted to say though is i think it is great how much credit so many of you
give your wives. i have seen some really nice comments (beautiful...just
like her, etc.)  at the risk of sounding like an idiot (actually happens
pretty frequently but, hell, who cares) i kinda wanted to commend all of you
for recognizing your wives contributions. and to the wives i know that the
men really enjoy your support, we get a kick out of women who are into cars
:)  If we support each other half as much then we will go strong for a long
time.
