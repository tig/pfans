any coolant labeled phosphate free and SAFE FOR ALUMINUM engines is okay to
use (i believe this applies to Dex-cool and whatever they are using in Vipers)

Drove a 95 Z-28 today and while it sounded REALLY GOOD (almost wished i had
a sloppy V-8) it wasnt very fun to drive the acceleration was okay but not
OH MY GOD and well it was an automatic and WOULD NOT once again WOULD NOT
even slip the tires. not to mention the fact that it had no first gear just
D, OD, and 2; what the hell is that?????  all in all pretty uninspiring and
nothing that makes me want to trade my car in.  i do have to say though that
the aftermarket exhaust and the racing stripes looked and sounded just
absolutely wonderful.

finally a question,
my roomate is a corvette owner (96 LT-4) not that we should hold that
against him, he is still cool and into porsches, any way he wants someone to
define in laymans terms what a CV joint is, i.e. where is it connected what
does it do etc.  his question stems from the haynes manual picture and not
understanding how it stays at a constant velocity (other than 0 )
