I noticed in Shaun Gray's post that he found a 2 inch section of timing belt
teeth were missing on his 85 944. I have read similar posts before, and
wonder if he has the updated water pump, which includes a shield betweent the
parts of the belt which pass very close to each other moving in the opposite
direction as the belt passes over the waterpump pulley. It seems like this is
the logical cause of missing teeth, the collision of them as the belts slap
together due to slight loosening with age or even normal vibration. Has
anyone lost teeth with the late type pump with shield. Also, I will be doing
some for fun tests on my belts when I remove them after 30k miles. I want to
know under what tension they will snap, etc, and compare this to the tension
they are set to. In fact for the cost of a second new one (about 9 bucks) I
think I will experiment on a new one too, just to compare the results. I will
post the details when I have them. Also, since I have the tensioner device
built in, I do not plan to splurge on the tool, but I would be very
interested to know what the built in device applies in the units of the
guage, for any of you experimentally inclined folks who have both to play
with.
