Howdy dudes,

First off, the car is in one piece and I kept the shiny side up (just barely!).
No one crashed except for one 510 (but it was already banged up before so
no big deal).

I'll take you through the course turn by turn so that you know what I'm
talking about later on.  Mission Raceway Park is a club racing circuit
by any definition.  It is not a world class racing facility, it is not
an SIR or PIR type of course, it is a good club circuit that has relatively
low speeds with a decent straight.

I'll start at the hot pits.  You come on the straight from the hot pits
and accelerate like hell until the 5 brake marker, jam on the brakes,
downshift until you are in 2nd gear and turn in to apex the wall and do
the hairpin (Turn 1).  You let the car drift out wide towards the wall
and stay full throttle, shift into 3rd gear as the track straightens out.
(this is called Turn 2A).  

You are now coming into the funnest corners on the track, Turn 2B and 3.
Turn 2B is a hard left hander taken in 3rd gear.  You jam on the brakes
and then turn in and let the car 4-wheel drift a bit, then tuck it in
to the left hand side, floor the brake pedal, downshift to 2nd and start
the turn-in to Turn 3 (a hard right).

If you've done all of this well, you are now on the curbing on the right
side getting ready to turn in to a very important corner, the one leading
to the back straight.  The long smears of paint on the concrete wall are
very intimidating.  You accelerate flat out through 2nd and then into
3rd.  Once you've completed the Turn 4/Straight combo, you are coming to
a critical area, Turn 5 which leads onto the Carousel.  Turn 5, is a hard
left taken in 2nd gear.  The crowd can watch you here from the grid area,
so this is where you do your big slides for your pit crew :)  Paul laid
2 black patches when he was dicing with a Player's Camaro in this corner.

The hard left then leads onto the most important corner of the track,
the Carousel is a long sweeping hairpin (if you can imagine that).  It
is slightly banked.  If you get it right, you rocket onto the straight,
if you get it wrong, 2-3 cars will pass you immediately!  Coming onto
the straight is one of the most intimidating things you will encounter
on a slippery surface, a large bump that you go over at 45 degrees
with full throttle!  Last year, a 944T spun around and bounced between
the straight's walls.

In my next post, I'll talk about how we did.

Farzaan.
