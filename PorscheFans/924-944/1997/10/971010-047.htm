Hi! I'm new to this (Porsche stuff) so please excuse some basic
questions.
First, what weight of oil would my 1979 924 like best? Would a
multigrade (like 20W-50) work better than a straight 30 weight? I'm not
racing this car, just pleasure driving.
Second, my oil dipstick has a round section at the end about 12-15mm
long, then there's an oval cross section the rest of the way. About
another 12-15mm up there is a line embossed into it. Since I have no
owners manual I don't know just what levels these things would be
indicating. Can anyone help?
Thirdly, my oil pressure gauge goes immediately to the 10 bar mark when
I turn on the ignition. Is this a bad sensor? Where (other that the
dealer) could I get one, if so?
Oh, by the way, I read a post from Lee Lichtenstein about the turn
signal fluid, so I checked mine. Would you believe that someone had
cross-connected the high pressure hydraulic line to the brake light
spoiler servo valve and the brake light grease had contaminated the turn
signal fluid all to hell? Now my turn signals stick on and the brake
light grease is so thin I skid right through the lights! I'm going to
have to flush all those lines this weekend.
I think I'm really going to enjoy this car.
