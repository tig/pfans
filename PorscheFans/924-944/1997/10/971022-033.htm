For those who have not been following, I have been doing a project with a
1982 924.  Never satasfied with any car that is "stock" I pulled the
injection system and installed a set of Weber 40 DCOE side draft carburators.

They have been running rather well up to last weekend when I finally bent
over and bought a set of jet drills to fine tune the jetting.  Upon
inspecting the plugs, I deemed that I was VERY rich everywhere.  I went to
a 125 main, and a 44 pilot.  It's a whole new car again.  I got it as close
as I can with the "plug reading" method, and I know I am close, but I
really need to get it on an infra red scope.

Any way, if someone would have told me about the amount of power that a
simple (not really) induction change would have made, I would call them a
liar.  It is flat impressive now.  Much more power everywhere.  No longer a
need to downshift to pass at speeds above 60mph.  

If anyone has questions, please feel to contact me.  I do need to note that
as far as emmissions are concerned it is way illegal for anywhere but
Idaho, Montana, wyoming, and maybe Egypt =).  Most other states would have
my registration revoked.

Jay
