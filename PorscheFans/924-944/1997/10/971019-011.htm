Hi Alex, You Wrote,
>1.  Is it possible to make a copy of the wheel-lock keys?  

Yes the dealer has blanks and will cut them for you.  (Porsche keys are
generally made of hard steel and many independant kay places will not cut
them for fear of ruining their cutting wheels) If they don't fit, the
dealer will recut at no cost - at least they did for me.

going to 
>put snows on the rear wheels.  Is this OK?

Just do the normal stuff - check coolant strength, Battery, oil, plugs etc.
 I run snows on all four corners, it does make a difference on my car and IMO.

>3.  With regards to snow tires, I was planning on picking up a spare set of

the 968 
>or can I use any 924/944 rims?

 A spare set is a good idea. You can only use minimum 16" rims in order to
clear the brake calipers.  Your offsets are: Fronts 55mm, Rears 52,3mm.
Any 87 and later 944 with 16" wheels will fit. Also later 911 and 928
should fit but I would call "Wheel Enhancement" and speak to Robert Wood to
get the full story.

>4.  Should I go to Porsche for all my maintenance?  Obviously for stuff
like an

action.  
>However, what about for straight forward stuff like fixing a tire,
changing a

anybody

many

Porsches 
>(especially 968s).  But from what I've read, there's a lot of potential 
>pitfalls in working on these cars.  Any suggestions here??

I would only let a knowledgeable Pcar mechanic touch my car for stuff I
cannot be bothered to do.  I however, use independant shops, not the
dealer.  There are just too many little things that a generic mechanic,
however skilled, needs to know to work on these cars.  I would not like to
be the customer on whose car he learns from his mistakes.

>5.  One time, I came back to the car and the alarm was going off.  I
didn't see 
>any signs of forcible entry or anyone around the car.  Will the alarm go
off by 
>itself or are there thing that can happen which will trigger the alarm even 
>though its not being broken into.

Cannot help on this one.

>Any help is greatly appreciated.  I'd also luv to hear from anyone else
who has 
>a 968 to hear about his/her experiences.  Thanks,
>
Cannot help on this one either.
