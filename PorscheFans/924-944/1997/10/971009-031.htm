Don't let it bother you.  I think there are a lot of  911 owners that still
cling to the notion of "it's not a real Porsche with the engine in front
(or with water pumping)".  These are the same people who are no doubt bad
mouthing the new water cooled models.  There are probably more than a few
911 owners who begrudge the fact that a 944 is easier to learn to drive
fast.  At several drivers ed's I had participated in it was not uncommon
for a 911 guy to come over and ask "what do you have in there?" as if I had
hopped up my engine or something.  They just couldn't believe that for the
average boy racer, a 944 can be driven faster; it is a better balanced car.
