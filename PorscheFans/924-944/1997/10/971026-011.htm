Hey Pfans,
	Had a tough time with a Parts place Last month. I posted a note the =
other day about the problems I ran into and some of you wanted to know =
the name of the place.   The place was Volkspares in Westminster, CA. I =
cannot say that they are a terrible place to order parts, I think the =
experience was poor for both of us.   I was just looking for a used A/C =
compressor and they came up with the best price for a part in "Good =
Condition."  I ordered the part about September 15th.  After they =
received the payment I waited a week.  Nothing,  tried calling and they =
told me that part they had originally offered was defective and they had =
just found another one and it would be shipping today.   After about 6 =
more calls of "it will ship today" I finally made a complaint to WBA =
(Web Business Assoc.)  I got a reply right away and they are returning =
my payment.  I think the Owners are stand-up people, just had a tough =
time getting to the truth on this one.  Would have been nice to know he =
part was bad and they were looking for a replacement instead of them =
telling me it would be shipping today. I don't think that was really =
fair to me, the customer, who had taken care of my end of the bargain.
	Anyway if I say I had a bad experience w/Volkspares, maybe 10 of you =
will say you had a great experience.  Anyway that is the rest of the =
story.
