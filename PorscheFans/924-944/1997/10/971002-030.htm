I'm looking to get recommendations on front brake pads for my wife's '77
924. I wanted to get Metal Masters after all of the good press I've heard
about them, but it doesn't sound like Axxis (formerly Repco) makes them
for this early a car (4-lug suspension). Can anyone out there tell me:

1) Is there another application, such as early Rabbit, that they are made
for which I can specify so I can use Metal Masters? Axxis part#?

2) Alternatively, can you recommend other types of pads for uprated
street/track use that will fit it? I don't want a warm-blooded-only pad,
since this is my wife's car, but I can't stand the way the stock pads fade
to nothing after a couple hundred feet on these wonderful twisty back
roads I live on...

I can get the Semi-Metallics locally, for a decent price (even more decent
without shipping and added convenience), are they good? More fade
resistant? I can deal with a little more dust if it's worth it, but I can't wait
forever, since I'm almost out of pad!

TIA
