Hi  Marv & P-fans
	Regarding your intermittent 951's boost problem.  Two things to check. Boost
dump valve -  on the intake boot, to the right of the throttle body with a
vacum line going to th etop of the valve. Remove the boost valve -  and
pressure check to see if it holds boost pressure. Or. The ignition KLR box
could be going bad. When the ECU detects ignition knock, the ECU sets the
maximum boost to 1.2-1.3 Bar. If you turn the engine off, then restart it,
the ECU will reset to normal max boost 1.7 Bar stock (2.0 bar w/chips) the
ECU has no "hard" memory. Your ECU could be going bad? Can you swap out the
ECU with a freinds car? 
						Good Luck, David Jalali

I am gathering opinions on what to look for with my car.

Symptoms:

Boost intermittent.  Some times I get 1.6 bar, sometimes 1.2 maximum.  It 
seems to be one or the other no middle ground.

If I stop for a few minutes with the engine off, it may return to 1.6.

What things should I check for?

Recently I had the intake manifold off to service the oil pan gasket.  A 
cursory look at the vacuum lines and wires seems all right, but a 
detailed review is in order.

I understand that the boost gauge is not absolute in accuracy, but it 
seems to me that I should get 1.7 bar from my 89 Turbo.  Am I right?  I 
thought that is what I used to get.

Also, either I am just getting used to this car, or there is a 
performance degradation from what I remember.  It just seems ho-hum any 
more.  Again, when I first got it last February, it seemed to be 
"quicker".  Today I did a short run while I had 1.6 bar.  It pulled 140 
mph without much of a fuss, but that isn't very scientific and I was 
running out of road.   Good thing, too, a State Trooper was perched at 
the end of the road where this section of road mates with the main 
highway.

Thanks in advance,

There is a significant performance difference to be felt between 1.2 and 
1.6.
