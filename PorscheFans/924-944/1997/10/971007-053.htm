Bob,
I used Camberballs in my 85.5 944 and I'd highly recommend them.  They make a
noticeable improvement in turn-in and stability, and I think you'll find
you'll need less static negative camber because you'll hold camber better in
the turns (at least that's what my pyrometer readings told me).  I was able
to get all the negative camber I needed with the stock adjustment.  There's a
surprising amount of flex in the rubber strut turnstyles, which allows the
outside strut top to move toward positive camber under cornering loads.

They're also very well made, easy to install (no drilling or other mods
required) and reasonably priced, even compared to the original-equipment
rubber turbo units.  I plan to buy a pair for my new (to me) 88 Turbo S in
the near future.  Anybody else interested?  I was one of the first 944
Camberball customers so I got to know the owner a little -- he was looking
for feedback from the first 20 buyers.  If we could assemble a volume order
(maybe ten or so?) as was done with the SmartCamber gauge, I bet he'd offer a
discount.  
Let me know if anyone's interested and I'll pursue it on behalf of the group.
