A followup to my posting whining about a broken master to slave clutch 
line after replacing both cylinders.  

I ended up paying for the line and 1 hr of shop time.  The shop ate 1 hr of 
time.  For me, the key was that I went home satisfied.  It turns out that the 
leak came from the joint where the rubber part of the hose fit into the 
metal sleeve.  The shop returned my old line, showed me where the leak 
was, showed me the difference between the old part and the updated part 
(longer metal collars) and it was plain that the rubber had shrunk and was 
loose on the collar.  As they had just worked on it, they just charged an 
hour.

With the new line in, the slight drag I felt shifting (esp. reverse) is almost 
completely gone.  This makes me feel like that line must have had a small 
leak before failing completely.  Now, at least I can feel a difference for 
the $750 I've dropped into the clutch.  

What are the odds that my clutch is going to go out now :-)
