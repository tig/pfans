     Hi,
     
     As some of you might remember from my earlier postings a couple of 
     months ago I've been looking for new seat covers for my limited 
     edition 944 Turbo S.
     
     Well I've been offered complete seats from a couple of sources in the 
     US but shipping complete seats over to the UK is going to cost too 
     much. 
     
     Would anyone in the US be willing to have the seats delivered to their 
     location, take off the covers and ship then to me and then dispose of 
     the seat frames that remain ?
     
     The seats are located in Arlington VA and  Southern California.
     
     If any of you are willing to help out please reply to me direct and I 
     will contact the sellers and arrange it.
     
     Thanks for your help.
     
     Regards,
     
     Steve Cox.
