>Subject: Throttle Response Cam

>Hello all,

>I recently purchased one of those redesigned throttle response cams for
my
>1995/2 944 and I have a small question regarding installation. I am
hoping
>that someone out there has done this before and can answer my question.

>Steps one and three of the directions I received from Performance
Products
>were simple enough--basically I just replace the old cam and adjust the
>stop under the gas pedal. However, step two as it was stated left me a
>little confused. It reads...

>"STEP TWO: Pry the section of the throttle cable that goes through the
>firewall so that the two 13mm jam nuts can be broken loose. Force that
>section of throttle cable back into the firewall and screw out untill
the
>slack in the throttle cable is almost completely removed. Just enough
slack
>must be left to allow the throttle to fully close with a "clicking"
sound.
>On the 1985/2 and later models, the adjustment is on the end of the
cable
>sheath near the throttle cam. If the throttle does not fully close, the
>idle will hang at a high idle of around 2000 RPM."

>Does this mean that on my 1985/2 Porsche 944 I can skip prying the
cable
>from the firewall and simply adjust the slack "on the end of the sheath
>near the throttle cam?" If so, how exactly do I make this adjustment?
It is
>not obvious to me when looking at it.

Have you ever adjusted a cable on your bicycle? This is extremely
simple.
I do not mean to offend but if you have problems with these kinds of
procedures
I think you should not try to attempt them.

>I would greatly appreciate it if someone who has done this before could
>e-mail me some more detailed instructions on how to adjust the cable
slack.

Loosen both the nuts (13 mm) which hold the cable to the throttle body,
by 
turning both nuts in the same direction you will adjust the cable slack.

>Also: Are there any major drawbacks to this "improved" design that I
should
>be aware of?

Why spend money on things which do not do anything for your car? It
might make
driving in traffic jams or town more difficult because you can not
regulate the 
throttle as precisely as with the original design.
