With all the talk lately about shifter/engine vibration and balance belt 
whine, I decided to check my balance shaft alignment and belt tension. In the 
process of doing this, I did a couple of experiments and also discovered that 
an oil leak I thought was coming from the rear main seal was actually coming 
from a leak in the oil pan gasket due to a stripped bolt (heli-coiled it to 
fix)..

First, some info about the work I have done on the car. This spring I replaced 
all the engine seals (except for the rear main), the races for the 
balance-cam&crank shafts, belts, and rollers, etc... I do not own the belt 
tensioning tool, but do have an >'87 engine in the vehicle as it has the auto 
tensioner for the cam belt. As such, I have never measured balance belt 
tension, but instead set it by hand. When I first installed the belts this 
spring, the balance shaft belt did whine a bit. After ~1000miles, I 
re-tensioned the belts again setting the balance shaft tension by hand. I do 
not recall when the whine decreased, but as of lately it was not noticeable.

So the other night I put the car up on jack stands to check the alignment of 
the balance shafts, perfect! (phew, I did it correctly the first time) 
However, the balance belt felt a bit loose, I could twist it more than 90 
degrees without difficulty. Just to get a feel for the magnitude of the 
vibration I was experiencing, I removed the balance belt and ran the engine 
through its RPMS, More vibration than I would care to live with on a daily 
basis... I then re-installed the belt, and tensioned to what felt by feel to 
be the same as the cam belt. Engine vibration was definitely better, but now 
there was considerable belt whine. I then tried a few relaxed tension settings 
(by feel again), running the engine in-between to get a feel for the magnitude 
of vibration. What I found is that a loose belt contributes to vibration. The 
amount of tension required to reduce engine vibration seems to be at the same 
amount of tension required to do the following: When pressing the span of the 
balance belt nearest the water pump until it touches the water pump pulley, if 
the upper balance shaft rotates, it is too loose. The belt tension failed the 
above criteria when I first checked it prior to experimenting. Of course, this 
is a VERY subjective guideline, but without the gauge, I can't do much 
better.. The engine is not free of vibrations, I still feel a little in the 
shifter, but it does not exhibit the same peak around 3k rpms that I was 
experiencing. The vibration that remains does exhibit some peaks, but is lower 
in magnitude throughout. Since I have little experience with other 944's, I 
can't say if the amount of vibration remaining is normal or not.

On another note,
Anyone on this list going this weekend to the "Get Acquainted with Vermont Fun 
Rally" hosted by the Hudson-Champlain Porsche Club of America? It is being 
held in Manchester Vt. My wife and I will be there assuming I can still make 
the reservations..

Thanks for reading my ramblings..
   Ezra
