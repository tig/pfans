Anyone interested in the differences of a Turbo "S" versus non "S"
should call their dealer and order the '88 944 Turbo S INFORMATION
Technik book.  PN. is WKD 495 021.  It lists for $9.41.  You will then
find all of the factory differences between the cars, as well as how to
tell the difference.  The book states...

944 Turbo S (Special Model M 758)

"Production of this special 944 Turbo mosdel is limited to 1,000 cars
for the model year.  This model differs from the standard 944 Turbo in
the following points.

*  Engine power 184 kW (247SAE-HP)
*  Sport running gear (M 030)
*  Stronger front wheel brakes (similar to 928 S 4)
*  Manual transmission with stronger limited slip differential
*  Clutch disc cemented additionally, two-stage steel spring dampner
*  Body paint finish in "silver rose metallic"
*  Interior equipment in burgundy multicolor

Turbo S cars are fitted with certain optional extra equipment items (see
scope of equipment on next page).

The brochure contains information up-to-date as of November 19, 1987"

I hope this clears up some of the thoughts.  All Turbo S cars will have
the M 44/52 engine versus the M 44/51 non "S" engine.

Thanks to all...Don Istook
