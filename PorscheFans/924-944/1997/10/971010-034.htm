Ah Insurance companies.....

There are some very heavy laws that cover this area, with REAL heavy
penalties. 

The common practice in the payoff side is to delay payment and offer
lowball deals, after all the customer is at there mercy, and needs to
repair or replace the car. (be a day late on a payment in and they will
kill you)

# 1. If you are damaged by their client, they are responsible for
providing you transportation until it is settled.
# 2. You can request actual replacement "Tell them you want either the
money to replace the vehicle or an equal vehicle. (Normally they will go
with an offer from a dealer as $'s). 
# 3. They are responsible for taxes and fees for replacement.
# 4. If they try and "drag their feet" in an attempt to avoid paying the
claim mention your Lawyer and "the Great Western case" ($10k claim that
resulted in $1+M punitive damages)
# 5. BTW: If they lose in court they have to pay legal fees

		haha... so true, but worst yet, its the insurance
companys scape
	goat.  I bought a car for 8500 (9100 or so after tax and all
that other
	stuff), and some guy totaled my car by rear-ending me while I
was at a
	complete stop at a stop light.  I had the car for less than a
month (~29
	days actually).  The insurance comp. told me their books said it
was
	worth only 7400.  I called the car dealer I bought the car from,
and he
	told me I paid under the going value for the car (it was a
trade-in)...

	But loosing $1100 or so is less than the cost of taking them to
court...
	so ripped off yet again.
