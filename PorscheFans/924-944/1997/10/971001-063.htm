i have bought from a lot of them and i can say these are the ones i liked,
and some i didnt (there is no interest here for me other than letting people
know)

1) george b. - great service and genuinely nice guy. really enjoyed talking
to him and he nows WAY too much stuff!!

2) paragon prod. - never bought from them but i did speak to Jason and he
led me to a place a needed to go, i.e. someone who had what i needed. will
definetly go back and it has NOTHING to do with his nephew that happens to
go to the same college

3) perf products - seemed less than knowledgeable  but i was only ordering a
lighted key maybe i hit an odd point of the selling guy. the stuff was
shipped on time and the only objection i have is the ommision of the
shipping charge which was like 8$ for a key!

4) vertex - talked to them on the phone and decided not to buy from them
just because of a rude salesperson.

5) zims auto - they are close to me so i decided to try them. the guy was
pretty knowledgable however the shipping just happened to be during the UPS
deal so i cannot comment about shipping but you all know about how long it
took to get stuff during that fiasco.

6) dynamic euro tech - great shop very impressed with service. i live about
3 hours from houston so i thought what the heck, i ll try them.  once again
during the UPS thing but i happened to go out of town on business no further
than 5 blocks away.  the shop was clean they even had a nice looking 73ish
911 with all the RS stuff, kinda nice i thought.

i can safely say that sometimes the price savings just arent worth the hassle!

now the dealerships:

1) porsche-audi center in San Antonio - pretty nice shop only actually have
about 3 porsches in stock but the service area is always full of them.
prices are kinda high at 69$pr/hr (or 79 i forget).  the service guys are
good and were more than willing to let me in the back to speak to the tech,
he even clocked in and out so i could see how much time i should have been
billed for as opposed to the flat rate i paid.  all in all if i had to i
would go back but they didnt clean the interior or steam the engine bay as
they had promised and they missed quite a bit on the 40pt.

2) the dealer in Austin - stay away very far away!  after the last dealer
lost a 911 off of a tow truck and ran into legal trouble (as well they
should have) it has not been the same, i believe the dealership even has new
ownership since that incident.

3) the dealer in arlington - I WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THE DOOR AGAIN.  after
i asked a few questions about the RS america they had the dealer responded
"real porsche owners know what they want and they oreder it that way!"  well
he didnt have a clue when i asked about the turbo tech. rims (he didnt even
know they were hollow spoked).  on top of that the window sticker in two of
their other cars were WRONG (actually they were on the wrong car but he
didnt want to listen to that (they had a C2 listed at 74,000$, when the C2
cab was listed at 61,000$) not to mention the obvious i.e. the conv top on
the wrong car, the color on the sticker wasnt correct (one was polar white
one way grand prix)  at any rate when he basically called me an idiot
teenager i walked out an vowed to never go near there again.  on a funny
note when i was walking out they had a 356 for sale supposed to be pristine
and the year wasnt even correct to match the letter i.e. 356C 195X. i
thought, " i wonder if he knows who the real idiot is?" the real shame was
my friend was with me and now he thinks all (p-car) dealers are like this.
(to the guy in Cali. who had so much problem, i know how you feel, just wish
i had the boxter to curb my frustration!! :-) )

matt
