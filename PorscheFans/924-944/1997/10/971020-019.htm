A couple of people had requested I post this information to the list for
general info:

I had bounced the idea of recovering my dash in leather myself  off of
the list last week, to see if anyone had done it or anything similar. I have
the early (77 924) dash. 

I've found that a hide of "lining" leather costs about US$50-60 from
Tandy Leather. This should be enough to recover a dash, w/ glovebox,
and possibly extra left over.  Since it would be ordered, it would seem
reasonable that you can select any reasonable desired cover. If you
wished to have something fancier, say a higher (softer) grade of leather,
or perhaps suede, expect the price to go up. I also found out through one
of the employees at the store that they had known of someone doing this
previously, though to what type of car remains unknown.

The concensus from the response that I got was that this should be
straightforward enough, just cut to fit as the leather is glued on with a
spray adhesive like 3M General Purpose Spray Adhesive (used it before,
easy to apply, good sticky power). There may be some stitching
necessary at the ends to accomodate complex features for the early
dash (I'm not familiar with the later one), otherwise it seems pretty
simple. Naturally, you'd want to remove the dash prior to application. In
my case, due to the extreme cracking present, I'll use some filler
('member those vinyl repair kits?) beforehand to get a good surface.

So that's as far as it goes for now; estimated cost US$75 or less,
I'd estimate to set a weekend aside to be sure of having enough time to
do things right. I'd expect this to cost much less than having it recovered
professionally (who wants more cracking vinyl, anyway?), look much
better, and last longer. However, I haven't done it yet, since I still have to
fix my brakes, replace my struts, and get my dirver's side door welded
back on! Maybe a good winter project - waittaminit - I don't have another
car - gues I'll have to do it in a quick afternoon, 'fore my wife gets
pissed...
