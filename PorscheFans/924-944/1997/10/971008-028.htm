Subject: Headlights for a 951

Hi PFans,

I'm looking to upgrade my stock sealed beams headlights to something
of a higher quality. When I had my BMW 320i, I put in Euro spec
lights that used plug-in halogens and had an optic pattern that was
razor sharp flat with a rise to the right. They were great, the sharp
edge allowed me to throw more light down the road without blinding
folks. 


Dear Cris,

I have used the Hella's in my last two 951S's and would definately recommend 
them. One thing to expect, though, is they are a European light and have very 
sharp cut-offs and throw a distict triangle of light to the right side of the 
road. They also require careful maintenance on alignment or they can be very 
blinding to on-coming traffic. Properly aimed, I feel they offer less glare 
than normal lights. I would also suggest a 55/100W H-4 bulbs.

One other suggestion... also change your fog light to the European combination 
fog/driving light. You will also find them in the Performance Products catalog 
on p.160 and they sell for $169.50 each. All you do is remove the existing 
lenses and screw the new units right in the old housing. I use these as well 
and they are fantastic.. daylight everywhere. Almost as good as the aircraft 
landing lights I used to use! And they look a helluva lot better than the 
reflectors that currently grace the unused part of your fogs.

If you do install both sets, you will also need to wire a relay into the 
system that is switched by the high-beams and conects the
driving lights and the high-beams directly to the battery.

Deposit on an M-class today -- ought to be a very nice tow vehicle for the

I know, it's an SUV!!!  But you've got to drive it before you trash it too bad.
