Listmembers,

I've been searching through the Porsche Classifieds Digest and a few =
other
places for a 944 S2 or 951.  I've located a couple of potential nice
sounding cars but both of them are of the "no receipts" variety.

One car down in Phoenix sounds really nice.  It's a 1987 951 in midnight
blue with tan leather (I would love that combo).  It has ABS and the =
usual
options and supposedly 65,000 miles.  It was originally a Calif car.
Asking price is $11,400.  The title is clean but is marked as TMU for
Total Miles Unknown.  According to the present owner of 5 months (he also
has a 911/Chevy V8 and a BMW) this car was a bank repo and it was picked
up at auction by a local independent Porsche repair shop, from whom he
purchased the car.  They have no records on the car other than Powerhaus
remembers doing a clutch on it two years ago.  The owner has a copy of
this receipt, but the mileage was not documented at that time.  The owner
did find a set of used timing and balance belts in one of the rear =
storage
areas, so he's pretty certain the belts were done recently.  Again, this
is not documented.  I suppose if I were the cynical type I could assume
this was a "plant" by the independent shop in order to sell him the car.

The owner says the car is in great shape inside and out but there are a
couple of problems.  The A/C does not blow cold, both fog light lens are
cracked, there is a small scrape or crease down low just in front of the
RR fender, and one of the C-2 wheels the present owner put on has a small
curb surf mark.  These don't seem like major items to me.  The owner
doesn't know if the car is chipped, but he will check.  He says he only
bought the car to drive while his 911 was being redone.  Now he has the
BMW to drive as a daily driver.  The only items he has replaced are what
he called the "turbo boost valve," I think he meant the cycling valve, =
and
he changed the fuel and oil filters and put 20W50 Valvoline in it (not
synthetic).

The other car is an S2 with 71,000 miles for $12,900.  This car also has
no records.  Anyway, the prices on these cars seem good, but the no
records bothers me.  What do you all think?  Walk  (or run) away, or
investigate further?

Cheers,
