it would be appreciated.

John,

I recently put on a pair of 250 lb springs I bought from Jason at Paragon=

Products on my '87 turbo.  The front end braking dive went away with the
body roll.  I should of changed the springs years ago, but like you I did=

not want to scrape on every ripple on the road.  The front is lower but I=

do not scrap any more than before due to the stiffness of the springs.  T=
he
ride is very firm but not harsh.  The factory should of supplied all the
944s with stiffer front springs.  My only problem is that my floor jack
will not fit under the car unless I lift the body up a bit.  If you have
the bucks, the ride height adjustable Konis can be cranked up or you may
get lucky and find a pair of M30 springs which I believe are standard
height.  =


When we get a few bucks ahead, we plan to install a set of stiffer spring=
s
on the S2.  Stiffer springs will not harm the a-arms or ball joints.  Als=
o
a set of Konis and aftermarket sway bars will help body roll but not as
much as the springs.
