Bob,
All these methods actually do one thing: They keep the wastegate closed
longer. This in turn allows more boost to build. There are several ways
to keep the wastegate closed longer. 1 is by shimming the wastegate this
is a fixed method and allows 1 setting only shim it and forget about it.
Another method is the bleeder valve method. This method is my favorite
because you can control your boost settings. Example when I go on long
highway cruises I usually set it at the stock level(11 lbs.)This keeps
the boost off when at cruising speeds (70-80mph.)
If the boost is constantly on at 4 or 6 lbs. when cruising this can
shorten the life of the turbo & the engine.
For cruising the streets I set it at max (17lbs.) This level of boost
wakes the car up. It is responsive yet civilized. With this setting you
must be careful of letting other unsuspecting people drive the car
(wives etc.)
The banjo bolt method also is  a fixed setting. This method I don't know
much about except the fact that it involves drilling the cycling valve.
