Folks,

Need some diagnostic help.  Car is 90 944 S2 with 58k mi.
Recently had 60k service - at which time the mechanic also
"adjusted the mixture".  The next day the car took two tries
to start.  Starting problem exists only after car sits overnight -
i.e. DEAD COLD.

Took it back to the shop, and the mechanic said the starter
was drawing excessive current.  I pulled the starter, took
it to an auto electricals place who pronounced it fine, but
replaced brushes and relubed for me.  Re-mounted the starter
and car turned over very sluggishly -- had to jump it to get
it started.

Went to Sears, old battery tested low voltage under high current
drain (simulated starting).  Replaced the battery.  Starter
cranks quicker.  This morning, after sitting overnight, again
took two cranks to get it started, though the starter/battery
sounds quick and healthy.

Any ideas?

Electrical:  I'd like to check the ground straps.  Where are they?

Fuel system:  I'm suspicious since the problem first appeared after
the mechanic reset the fuel mixture.  Where is the adjustment -- I'd
like to return it to stock setting.  Also, since the 60k mi service
included a fuel filter, I'm wondering if there's some problem resulting
from opening the fuel system.

Thanks in advance
