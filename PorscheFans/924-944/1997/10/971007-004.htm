[J. Dean Roberson]  Christopher Hanlon replied:
The vacuum line connecting the bypass valve to the three way connector
connecting to the fuel damper can come loose at either end.  This line =
is
probably the easiest to check and see.  Also check the lines from the =

 valve to : intake boot, wastegate, intercooler tube.

The bypass valve is located on top of the intake boot.  It should have a =
vacuum
line coming out of top of it.

[J. Dean Roberson]  I had the same problem with my original compressor =
bypass valve on my '87.  To check it, use a vacuum pump ( or you may =
perform it orally) to apply a vacuum to the valve diaphram at the vacuum =
hose connection and see if it leaks.  It should hold a vacuum.  If it =
leaks, replace it.  The cost for me was about $35 for the part.  It's =
about the easiest part installation you'll ever do on a 951.  Someone =
posted a message recently about using a 993 valve instead of the 951 =
part since it looks the same but has a metal diaphram and should last =
longer.  You may want to look into that since the 951 bypass valves have =
a very high failure rate.

BTW, my 951 also had low boost when I got it and I assume the leaking =
compressor bypass valve (busted diaphram) was the culprit.  I never knew =
for sure since I also did a computer chip change at the same time.

Good Luck,
