Dear Mark
	No, that sounds like the A-Arm bushing. The alloy control arms have a
bushing in the rear and in the front inner part of the A-Arm, allow the arm
to pivot up/down. The tie rod connects to the foward part of the
wheel/tire/hub. I believe that the bushing is only available with the A-Arm?
The A-Arms are EXPENSIVE! New, $600 each side!  I've seen a company sell
rebuilt control arms in Texas - I've heard they do a good job, Dynamic
European Technologies Inc 713-661-2780, $149 + core. I do not think Porsche
sells the bushings seperately.

 Is this a tie rod?  It felt almost like there was a spring holding the 
wheel in place that would allow it to twist toward the rear of the car when 
enough pressure was applied.
