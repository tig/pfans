<<According to Craig Seko at
http://livewire.newforce.ca/rsr/rsrcar/924/cstart.htm, "An early option on
the 924S was a one-inch steering column extension that worked wonders
provided one's fingers were long enough to reach the control stocks. This
$50 CND option also gave a slightly smaller three-spoke leather steering
wheel, a bargain in Porsche terms as the steering wheel on its own was a
multi-hundred dollar option (stock was plastic).">>

I have also read about this - I read the same exact words somewhere - but I
can't remember where.  However, I know several people with these cars
(including myself), and nobody has ever really seen the factory option
smaller wheel.  

I just can't let this go without putting in my 2 cents about the wheel
position on this car.  I have tried several sizes and variations and without
a doubt, the best one for me is a 14" Grant wheel with a 3" extention (yes
3"!).  I know that sounds like a huge amount of extension, but it really,
really, really makes the car much more comfortable to drive, and provides a
ton more thigh clearance.  And since the wheel is only 14", it is only 1"
smaller than the stock 15" wheel that came on my car, and might work for you.
 You might want to check this out.  E-mail me if you need more information.
