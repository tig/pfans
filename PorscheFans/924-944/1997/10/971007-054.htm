Hello,

> find.  I planned to go back on my next oil change and swap out the bolts
with the proper bolts and washers - just to make me feel good.  It isn't that
hard to do with the mounts in place and I like working in small places.  Must
use the proper Porsche parts, you know.

You have WAY too much free time :-)

> Well I ask the parts guy for some motor mount bolts for a '87 951.  He
comes back with two.  I say "No, I need four for both mounts'.  He responds,
suprised - "You replaced BOTH mounts ?".
> 
> Now I start thinking, who in the hell would go through the trouble of
supporting the motor, unbolting the a-arms, unbolting BOTH motor mounts,
unbolting the rack&pinion assembly, dropping the cross member, and then
fineagling the mounts in and out for a couple of hours to remove only ONE of
the mounts.  I guess from his response this is a common occurance.  I also
assume even some shops would do this, if the customer wanted to save the
price of a mount.   Talk about false economy.  If I didn't have the $80 for
the second mount, then I don't think I'd be driving - anything.  

Yeah, some people do that. Then when the OTHER mount goes bad, they get to do
it again.
When I helped a friend replace the mounts in his 86 951, we did both.
Surprisingly,
the passenger mount was good! The PO replaced that one, now the driver side
was collapsed.

I don't recall which bolts we used. I do know that it was a real PITA to get
the new
bolts started into the new mounts. Then you get to turn them about 1/20" of
an inch
each time. Great fun!

Dear P-Fans & Barry
	When replacing the motor mounts in a 924S/944/951 with the updated ones
(part #951-375-042-04) there are longer bolts - to go with the updated
mounts. I believe there are three different lenghts of bolts available, but I
could only find part numbers for two sizes! 
	The bolts come in two sizes/lengths (8mm X 38mm - prt#900-378-024-02 and 8mm
X 42mm - prt#900-378-034-02) each motor mount uses two bolts (you have to
measure to see witch size you will need) and two washers (part#N-015-401-3).
	The bolts "drop-in from above the mount - which makes them a real pain in
butt to tighten! I found out that using a 13mm distributor ("L-shaped, bought
at SEARS) wrench up-side down works perfectly to tighten these damm bolts! 
								Good Luck, David Jalali
