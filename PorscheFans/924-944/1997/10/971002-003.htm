I had an independent mechanic do the job - who had a 944 transmission
for sale which fitted onto my 924S. I paid 700 DM for the used gearbox
(~390 US$), which was 50k miles "old". Cause he also changed my clutch
(broken rubber damper) at the same time i don't know how long it took to
change the transmission alone.
From what i saw it doesn't look difficult to change a gearbox. I assume
it's a 3-5 hour job... ??

BTW, Porsche wanted 6000 DM (~3330 US$) for a rebuilt transmission!

Greetings,
