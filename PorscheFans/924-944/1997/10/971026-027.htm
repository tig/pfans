There is no need to check belt tension more frequently than the factory 
15,000 mile interval.

The problem with the built-in tensioner is not too much tension, but too
little, as they have been known to 'hang up' and not apply the full
tension of the spring.  Belt dust and other residue gets thrown into the
works during normal operation of the engine.  Doing the release/tighten of
the tensioner is better than nothing at retension time if you do not have
a gauge available to you.
