I was browsing the web for Porsche-related stuff recently and happened
across the site ("it looks like a sportscar, but it's really a lemon") of 
one gentleman who owns a 83/84 (?) 944 (he might even be a member of this
list) and encountered the following problem:
 
while driving slowly in ~2 in. of standing water the placement/
configuration of the air intake caused the engine to induct water,
resulting in spun bearings and the need for an engine rebuild/replacement.

I commiserate with this fellow P-owner because, although a 944 is clearly
not designed for amphibious duty, I would not anticipate this problem.
The site chronicles the owner's attempts to get PCNA to acknowlege this
design flaw and to pay for part of the engine rebuild.  There is also a
messageboard with some intelligent posts but a lot of "I once had a 944
but it was slow and then the belts broke at only, like, 55k and I will
never buy another Porsche" type Porscheantifan dimwit stuff.

The Question:  How dire is the threat of inducting water through the stock
intake setup in wet conditions?  I have been a member of this list for
some time and have heard shimmy/belt/waterpump issues discussed with near
nauseating frequency, but never the "Vacuum-Porsche" effect. (So that's
what they mean by "Wasserpumper"  :) )

Has anyone out there modified their car specifically to prevent this issue?
One could easily relocate the intake location, or eliminate/shorten the
filterbox extension, but then we would induct warm air from the engine
bay.  How large, if significant, is that effect?  I suppose that installing 
a K&N cone setup will eliminate this threat andfinally give me the ability 
to ford raging rivers  :)
