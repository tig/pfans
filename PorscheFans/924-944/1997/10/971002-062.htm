hey Pfans,

a while back someone posted a question about switching the speedo, and the
tach, so if your still  on the list drop me a line.
while replacing my speedo cable on my 78 924 today, i decided to try the
above. since i had my speedo out anyway, (impossible to get to the cable from
behind, must come out) so i figured hey, while im at ... i swapped them, pain
in the butt, the wiring harness is distance specific, so all the little
ground , lightbulbs, and sensor wires come up just short. i thought i had
them all in and reconnected,  alas turning on the dash lights left me with
mostly dark gauges :{. but, the speedo cable is long enough, and didnt bind
up with the relocation. so on another day i get the wiring straightened out
and extended as needed. this time ill be ready with plenty wire and
conectors. so i will leave it this way and work out the bugs, center is tach,
to its right is the speedo.
this after seeing a firebird with an aftermarket tach mounted flat into the
console (horizontal), i asked myself , self, why would someone ever do such a
thing, he must want to crash into a big tree? im still wondering about that
one........
next comes the head rebuild, and finishing off the donor car, and hopefull
get some of those pieces off of it that ive promised out.and the radio, and
the blower motor (new one ordered, pick it up sunday), and so on,,

sorry if i got carried away, 
eric  (ericj001@aol.com)
78-924 candy branywine, tach in center where i can really see it with out
crashing :)
year three begins, 1. body and paint,2. transaxle and tons of little stuff,
3. head, heat (shouldve done in year 1brrrr), and interior ,the saga
continues....
