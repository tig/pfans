Last night I replaced and repacked my front wheel bearings. When I put the
brake calipers back on I noticed that the hubs didn't turn nearly as freely
as before I removed them.  Both sides were affected to about the same
degree. I should mention the hubs turned freely without the calipers in
place. Driving the car this morning it felt slower from a standing start.
Another note: the car sat on jackstands with the calipers removed for about
three days before I got them back on(busy weekend). And I did hang them
with wire from the springs as per Haynes.

I've repacked the bearings before without a problem with binding so I'm
wondering if I did something wrong this time or was it because the calipers
were off for a few days and just needs some time to reset.

A note on shimmy: before this job I had very little shimmy, so smart me I
decided this time I would make sure the locking lugs were nearest to the
valve stem. Guess what...the shimmy is almost unbearable and I don't
remember where the locking lugs were before. What I like least about
working on the car is getting it on jackstands.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
