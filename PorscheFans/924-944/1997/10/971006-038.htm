Hi,

I have just recently acquired an 82 924 (running,no less) for a Jetta with a
broken transmission. On a recent scorching Texas day I broke my alternator and
water pump belt at the same time. Instant head gasket failure with accompanying
head warpage. Anyway, since I've it repaired my wife wants to have this car as
a dependable daily driver. What I want to do is go through the car and check
out various major systems to see what needs to be done. I've got no idea about
the maintenance history on this car as the last owner only bought it because it
was cheap. The brakes were allegedly worked on but after a year the front
rotors seemed to be shot and the brake fluid is green (as noted by Zims). I do
know that the car needs a new cam & followers (found by guys when fixing my
head). I wasn't paying $1,000 bucks for that! A good source for cams and
necessary parts is needed.  What else should I look at and in what order? Any
help for a neophyte P-car driver would be greatly appreciated (and probably
necessary).

Thanks,

Ron

85 GTI (226,000 mi. and still burning!)
