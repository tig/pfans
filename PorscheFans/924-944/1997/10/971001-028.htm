>==================================

Well, assuming the exchange rate is C$1.3811(according to today's
newspaper) to the USD, that would make the low mileage Silver Rose and
the red '89 about US$21,000, and the higher mileage Silver Rose about
US$13,000.

The biggest question is  HOW MUCH CAN YOU AFFORD TO SPEND?????

All 3 cars started out basically identical, as far as equipment and
performance are concerned.  The Silver Rose model was a Limited Edition
which should command a slightly higher price, just because of its
rarity, <underline>all other conditions being equal</underline>.

The standard phrase used by many of us (both here on the list and
Porsche-pushers in general) is:  "Buy the newest, lowest mileage, best
condition vehicle you can afford".

Have you had any of them checked out by a knowledgeable Porsche
mechanic???  Looks can be very deceiving at times.  Do you know the
service history of any of them???  Do you know any of the previous
owners personally.  There are a lot of very subjective
questions/answers that have to be determined.  You have to keep in mind
that these are all relatively high-maintenance vehicles that can come
back to bite you in the behind if you aren't prepared.  As far as
performance modifications are concerned, I wouldn't worry about those
at this point, because even stock, these are already potent performers.
 Don't worry, there will be plenty of time for "goodies" later on.

To sum it up - you have quite a bit more research to do before you can
make an intelligent decision.


At least, these are my thoughts - YMMV - Close cover before striking -
yada, yada.
