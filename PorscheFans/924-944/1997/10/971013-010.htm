Doug,
     Assuming you didn't mean to say sensor (a sensor would have wires 
attached to it), I think you have removed the oil pressure relief valve from 
the oil/coolant heat exchanger. How critical is it to re-tap the threads? 
Well, that depends on how damaged they are and if you want your oil pressure 
to all of a sudden drop to zero at WOT and high RPM's. The oil pressure relief 
valve must be installed correctly! Since it screws into the oil/coolant heat 
exchanger housing and the engine block, those items must be properly aligned 
as well. I would suggest that you remove the oil/coolant heat exchanger, fix 
any damage to threads, replace all the seals, and re-assemble with the proper 
tool (your going to have to do it at some point anyway, might as well take the 
opportunity now. When you see the old seals, you will be glad you did it...)

Good Luck,
          Ezra
