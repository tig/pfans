Just wanted to waste some more bandwidth before the weekend...

A week or so ago I posted a request for help in diagnosing a headlight
motor problem. The outcome was that one of the headlight buckets had
caught on the body when being lowered, causing the motor to overload
and blow the fuse. After replacing the fuse and adjusting the mounting of
the headlight bucket, the motor worked again. However, the diagnosis of
the first problem led to creation of a second problem.

The headlight motor would only operate when requested on occasion,
sometimes the lights would stick up, sometimes they would stick down.
Investigation showed that there was proper supply voltage at the motor,
and the switch and associated wiring was functioning properly. If I
moved the headlights part of the way by hand, the motor would take
over after a certain point and open or close the lights as requested.
Sometimes I could get them to work by wiggling the connector.

It turns out one of the pins in the 4-pin connector had died - the one with
three times as much wire going into it as it should have, as assembled
from the factory. This connector type is actually a standard AMP
connector, with replaceable pins (AMP is a huge supplier of electronics
parts like this). Using the tools of an electronics tech here at work, I
removed the pin from the connector (which promptly broke off in my
hand), cut it free, stripped the wire, and crimped on a new one. The
repair cost about $.02 for a new connector, and it's as good as new. 

Just wanted to let everyone know that these type of connectors, used
heavily on our cars, can be repaired if they fail, at minimal cost, instead
of replacing the entire harness! Major money savings!!!

Hope this helps someone...
