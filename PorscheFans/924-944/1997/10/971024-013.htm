1) where is the cheapest place to get repair manuals in the shortest length
of time, printed and in binders not on fische?

2) does anyone sell different setd of gears for 944's, i have seen turbos
and 911 but i figure while i am replacing the rear of the car i might as
well switch gears if it is reasonable?

3) what in the world does a fuel pressure regulator do.... i understand the
concept of fuel+air=power, is this what we are going for...it almost seems
like a toy to me?

4) would 400lb. springs front and larger bars f/r be too much for street
use?? moderate street use that is...under 50mi. per week, frequent track
use...car is 85.5 944NA

5) would anyone out there like to gift me a new transmission (have blown
ring and pinion in current one)...poor college student might be some way to
make it a tax write off....i know but if you dont ask then you never know,
not to mention, maybe someone remembers how it was to be poor in college, i
know i will NEVER forget!!! :)

thanks
matt
