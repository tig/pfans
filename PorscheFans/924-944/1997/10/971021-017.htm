PFans,

        This issue is probably of interest only to owners of S and S2
models. I have read the recent posting concerning a class action against
Porsche as a result of failed chain tensioners. I have only recently bought
a 1990 S2 with 80,000 miles and am fairly certain the chain tensioner has
never been replaced. I have spoken with three separate and supposedly
knowledgeable sources who are not in any way related to Porsche and
therefore have no ax to grind. They were quite adamant in their stance that
the chain tensioner only has a problem when belts have not been properly
serviced or replaced and break. Clearly I would rather spend 3-400 than 7000
if it is necessary, but if not I can find something to do with the $400.
Does anyone have any definitive knowlege about this issue?
