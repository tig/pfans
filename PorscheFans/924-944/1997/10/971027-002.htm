Bill,

Unless that Reality check bounces you may not have a case.  Both of my 
clutches with the rubber center lasted about 100K miles.  I have heard of 
some that did not, but time and heat are the enemy.  However, I would 
welcome some of the latter right about now.  As far as I know, the 
duration of the 944 clutch life is very reasonable, nevertheless, very 
few of us can say that they fail at a convenient moment in our lives.  I 
am sure some lawyer, somewhere, could make a case against Porsche for 
that, but as for the life span, probably not.

On the flip side, we Turbo owners may have some thing to bark about.  In 
place of the rubber center is a set of springs on the disk.  The smaller 
of which have been known to fracture and cause catastrophic clutch 
failure.  Again, this happens at times 99.994%* of us feel is 
unopportunistic.  My 89 Turbo failed at 105K miles.  Upon inspection, I 
found that the clutch disk still had about 5K miles left!  That equates 
to 4.76% of my clutch life that I have been cheated out of!!!  I figure 
that Porsche now owes me $23.80 (calculating $500 for a new clutch X 
4.76%) for a design flaw in their clutch.  I have instructed Dewy, 
Cheatem, and Howe, my attorneys, to bring a class act suit against PCNA 
for the amount of $23.80.  If I prevail, I promise to spread the $23.80 
amongst the PorscheFans, but I plan to keep the suit for myself.

* In a recent road side poll of stranded motorist, 99.994% agreed that 
this was not a good time to have a clutch failure.  The single dissenting 
vote came from a recently divorced female who has since been remarried to 
the owner/operator of a local towing company.
