Hi,
The 87 951 was going great guns after replacing the cutoff valve on the
intake boot.  Good boost and equally good driving until today.   
The car now feels like it is constipated (talk about giving your car human
attributes) - the boost will not go above 1.2 on the guage and there is a
corresponding lack of performance.
I checked that all vacuum lines are hooked up, also that there are no leaks
on/at the myriad hose connections.
The O2 sensor appears to be ill though.  If you hook up a digital volt
meter to the output pins, the reading stays at 0.69volts and does not cycle
through the 0.2 to 0.7 volts as befits a healthy sensor (or so I was told).  

Now the questions:
1.	Will a non-functioning  O2 sensor affect/retard boost? 
2.	What else can I look for, assuming the sensor is not the culprit?

BTW. while researching the purchase of an O2 sensor from various parts
places, the local NAPA guy comes back with their generic O2 sensor, p/n
OS-200-SB (not Bosch but made to fit 84/86 Mustangs and TBirds  or 85/86
Lincoln Continentals with 302 engines) all for the princely sum of
$33.69CDN. (Yes! $23US)  I personally will not know if it fits the 951
until I take my own out of the car next week. AT this price, one can
replace at least eight of them before reaching the cost of a single dealer
sensor @ $287 CDN. 

With the PFans network working sporadically - I would appreciate a direct
email response from some kind soul.
Thanks.
