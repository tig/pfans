Darryl,

I know of one difference between the 82 and 80 model turbos.  The later model
had a different turbo oil return line that hooked into the oil separator to
provide better vacuum to the turbo bearing housing and thus better oil control.
That is, it doesn't smoke as much.  You might need this updated oil return line
on the newer turbos.  Don't know for sure.

As far as the bellhousing is concerned, I suppose you know the gearbox is 
totally different on the 82 model.  Don't know if they changed the front end
of the deal.

I'm trying to find out if a 79 turbo tranny will fit my 80 model.  I've heard
everything from "no problem" to "there's no such thing as a 79 turbo".  I would
assume the 79 was just a warm-up for the 80 model year, which means lots of
"experiments".  If you or anyone else on the list have any knowledge of this
79 turbo clutch/tube/tranny issue, I'd appreciate all the input I can get.

Thanks, and good luck with your 80-to-82 transformation.
