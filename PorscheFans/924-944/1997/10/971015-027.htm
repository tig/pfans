No offense or flaming intended, but these mods aren't worth the price. You
may get some slight change in torque/hp distribution, but you won't feel an
appreciable change in overall power.  You can also add a cat-back and
cat-bypass to the package, and power increase is still negligible. At least
little or no change in 0-100 mph times.
