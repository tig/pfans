Eric: 

Sounds like he was adjusting the throttle stop, effectively moving the
throttle pedal open a bit to compensate. Slack in the accel. cable is
adjusted by a couple of nuts on the cable housing where it bolts to the
intake and throttle body.

As for the wandering idle, I have no idea, because I've got a similar
problem myself: ('77 924 auto) When the beast is warm, occasionally the
idle will go to 1000 rpm and climb to about 1800 rpm after being put in
Park or Neutral, and then will shortly drop to the proper
idle of 800 rpm. I don't believe this is specific to the automatic
transmission cars. There's no indication of any poor running during this,
however, everything's smooth. The car has 122kmi. Does anyone out
there have any ideas for all of our 924 idle problems???
