>I know there has been some discussion regarding
boost control on the 951's ,so I thought I would add my =

question.
    Is it possible to use an electronic boost controller such as
an HKS EVC ,or a GREDDY PROFEC on the 951???   These work very well on
Japanese car and pretty much eliminate
the "boost spike" you get with the stock 951 set up.  My '89
951s with Autothority stage 2 would "spike" at 16-17psi and them drop bac=
k
to about 14.5 psi.  Without the "spike" it would probably be possible to
run 16psi all the time.  I am
pretty sure it is this "spike" overboost that killed 2 head gaskets!!!!!
  Also ,how about an upgraded blow off valve (compressor by-pass) ???? =

They sound great ,but will they help keep the turbo spooled up on the
951's???

As I have become desperate to drive my turbo again, I have committed the
ultimate sin.  We are using rice burner technology.  The wastegate on the=

951 can leak, flutter and cause spikes.  An aftermarket wastegate and
controller are supposed to be the answer.   The HKS EVC 4 seems to be the=

choice of the sub 10 second rising sun iron.  To go with it, we have foun=
d
a reasonably priced two chamber wastegate that the Buick Grand National
rockets use.  According to those who have broken more parts than I have,
the fancy controller will not do the deed without a dual chamber wastegat=
e.
 =


Although I am not totally convinced that the stock cycling valve is not
adequate, we are replacing it with  a blow off valve that is adjustable. =

Break a turbo shaft and you will not leave home without one.  Some of the=

mega hp burners use two blow off valves.  How this will affect keeping th=
e
turbo spooled up remains to be seen.  Expect a report in a month or so.
