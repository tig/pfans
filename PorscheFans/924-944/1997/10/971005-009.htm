Be carefull with applying heat. Use a pencil torch, still be carefull.
When things are heated up at only one place, they may crack.
I assume you didn't remove the radiator so I think you can not drill a
little hole in the bolt. If you can you can try a tapering left
threathed tap.
If it was to me I tried the heat.

To prevent bolts become stuck in alloy metal use a little cuppergrease
when srew in the bolt.
