Very common problem.  Most common culprit is the temperature switch on =
the
radiator (upper left corner - plugin connector) staying on all the =
time...

Good Luck!

|Hey guys:
|
|Think I may have zeroed in on the power loss problem on my 924S.=20
|Apparently the battery is dying, because the fans run all the time
|regardless of the engine temperature.  So this means that it is =
probably
|a good idea to check the fan circuit, fuse, and relay.
|
|The reason I figured this out, is that when I went to start the other
|car tonight I heard a soft whirring coming from the Porsche.   I
|thought, what the heck is that?  Upon investigation, sure enough the
|fans where whirring away and the car hadn't been driven for at least
|five hours and had to be cold.  I also noticed that right after I =
jumped
|started her this morning the fans came on while she was still cold, but
|I didn't make the mental connection then.  Knew something was amiss
|right off though this time.  The fans are killing the battery!
|
|So what do you think?  Bad relay switch or something else related to =
the
|fans that could be making this happen.  What should I do now, replace
|the relay?  Suggestions for how to proceed from here appreciated.  TIA!
|
