Well, I find myself sending thanks once again. I had several responses to my
recent request for input on a really bad shift lever situation. All responses
were to the contrary of a local P-Dealer that said it was definately a
problem in the transmission and expect to pay from $500-1000.
Well, I followed the advice I was given by the people here and checked all
the linkage. I traced it from the actual lever, to the transmission. I found
several things. 1. The plastic cup that the lever ball sits in is cracked and
needs replacement. 2. The main linkage adjustment bolt is so loose it was
hardly on. After tightening that bolt, the shift lever was put back on and it
worked perfectly! If it were not for the fact I lost the small c-clamp that
holds the lever on the the rod, I would have got away with no cost and about
1 hour of work, but the job ended up costing me a whopping 22 cents. I have
been told this is not an uncommon problem, and if you know where to look, (it
took more time to find the linkage adjustment than anything else), and if you
have small hands to tighten the bolt. It really is easy to do. If anyone
needs better instructions, let me know!! The shift lever feels better now
than it ever has!!!

Thanks Again,

Terry
