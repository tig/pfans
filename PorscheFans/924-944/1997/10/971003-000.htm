Ezra:

I used my 968 through last winter in Cleveland.  I bought a set of Pirelli
Winter 210 snows which seemed to work very well on snow and ice.  I used
205/55/16 all around, which is my standard front size.  The Pirellis are
built on a performance tire carcass, so their dry road handling is
surprisingly good.  I believe that the Blizzaks are built on a much softer
carcass, which would be inconsistent with use on a 944.  Whine with the
Pirellis is low-moderate, and wear was pretty good.  I would recommend them.

With proper snow tires, the car itself was fine in the winter.  This is in
stark contrast to my 91 MR2 turbo, which I used to run with all season tires
in snow.  That car was SCARY!  The differences in tires, wheelbase, weight
distribution, rear suspension and power curve all worked against the MR2.

I have noticed that there have been no notes to the list over the past year
(that I can remember) mentioning rust or rust repairs on 944 series cars.
 This is very different from the Toyota list, which I was on for about 18
months.  This just doesn't seem to b an issue for our cars, I guess.
