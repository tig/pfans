>I have a few exhaust manifold questions. I have an '86 951. I have the '=
86

style two piece exhaust manifold. My motor is out so I have room for
different =

options. Is their any thing wrong with the '86 style exhaust manifold? Ar=
e =

their any advantages of the '87 style? Should I use the '86 style or shou=
ld
I =

buy the '87 updated style of manifold? Also has anyone had their exhaust =

manifold jethot coated? Was it worth it? Should I? I know it helps to
extrude =

hone the intake manifold, so will it help to hone the exhaust too?
<

Stephen,

The '86 manifold had a tendency to crack, some do some don't.  The '87 up=

have an expansion baffle added.  IMHO, I would wait to see if it cracks. =

The exhaust is not hard to pull.

Jethot will not help make stainless last longer.  The factory makes the
turbo pipes out of stainless to withstand the temperature.  If you want a=

slightly faster spool up, you can have the outsides coated with ceramic.

You cannot Extrudehone stainless only aluminum.
