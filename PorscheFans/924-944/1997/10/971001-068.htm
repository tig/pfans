I've been looking around for a sports car to replace my minivan.  While at a
dealer looking at a 911, I was looking around at the other cars they had.
 Two of them caught my eye.  One was a 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse with 5 speed
(34k miles) for $13,000, and the other was a 1988 Porsche 944 5 speed (107k
miles) for $6500.  Both of these cars would fit my needs (back seat for the
kids, look good, and have a big enough trunk to carry tools).  I'm wondering
which would be the best buy for my driving habits.  I'm planning to use the
car as a daily driver (about 70 miles a day on combination highway/two-lane
curved road).  I will be driving over a small mountain and plan to drive
through the winter.  I live in Portland Oregon (low elevation), so we don't
get much snow, but it does ice up a little.  Can anyone who has experience
with these cars tell me how they perform on icy curves?  Another possibility
would be an older (91-93) Eclipse or Eagle Talon turbo with AWD.  I like the
feel of the Porsche (reminds me a little of the 914 I had in high
school...aaahhhh! The memories!), but I'm concerned with the amount and cost
of maintenance it may require compared with one of these other cars (I'm a
pretty competent mechanic).
     Any advice on Bang for the Buck, resale value and overall value?  Thanks
In Advance.
