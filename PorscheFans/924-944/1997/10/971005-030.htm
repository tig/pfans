Hi,

Just wondering if anyone has experienced any vibrations which seem to be
coming from the rear of the car under hard acceleration.  I just replaced
the shocks and the problem appear to go away for awhile but now it's back.
The frequency at which it vibrates is faster now due to the new shocks I
assume.  The CV's have less than 15k on them and were checked less than 5k
(Look fine).  I did notice that the vibration appears to go away for a few
accelerations after I have the car up in the air for a bit.  It will then
come back after I drive around for awhile.  Anyway if anyway has any tips
or advice from their experiences I'd appreciate any and all before I just
go and start replacing parts.


Thanks, Brent
