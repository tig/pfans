Thanks for the additional info, Mike.
If only I had known that all of these little tidbits would come to be
published, I would have started a separate file long ago - now I have to go
back thru all of my little notes scattered throughout my second bedroom and
computer and try to organize stuff........Unless someone else has already
done this?????????

PS - Is anyone besides Mike Wachholz planning on being at Blackhawk Farms
this weekend for our Octoberfest???  I will be floating between corner
working, instructing, and bridge flagging.  Hope to meet some of you if
possible.
