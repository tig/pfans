This is in responce to thread about different part suppliers.  Last March I
drove my 86 951 from Boston to Miami.  I figured that while I was in Miami
I would go to Vertex and pick up some stuff w/o having to pay shipping.
I am so glad I went.  When I first got there I knew right away it was a bad
situation.  There was a guy there who had a 90 C4 that had gone in for some
minor work and they were trying to bill him $1900. for work he didn't ask
for or want.  He also had a receipt of that same work being done recently
(yes, I was eavesdropping!).  He said that they should of called him before
they started unauthorized work, but they didn't care.  I have no idea how
it ended because they asked him to wait outside and then locked him out!
I should of left.
However I stayed and asked about a few parts.  They asked me if the car was
here, and I said yes.  They offered to look at it real quick and let me
know if I needed anything else.  I said sure.  Well, I pulled the car out
back and they proceeded to run the engine to the red line about 10 times,
they shut off my car and told me I needed $500 worth of emergency work
because my car was a fire hazard.  They said that the fuel lines on the 944
turbo were designed wrong and that I needed to have them reroute it.  Well
I instantly knew this was BS and they were trying to screw me.   I told
them I would run to the bank and be back with the cash (just to get out of
there).  They said that before I left I owed them $85 for expert diagnosis.
 I was incensed.  I  told them no problem to put on the repair order that I
was going to have them do.  He tried to give me grief, but I quickly hopped
in my car and took off.
I have to say I was lucky, partly due to this list.  The "mechanic" there
didn't speak English and seemed "seedy".  I was lucky I watched them do
everything because I bet they would have sabotaged something.
These are obviously just my feelings and observations.
By the way my car has never been a fire hazard.  I also asked my local
Porsche shop (a trustworthy one) and they said that what I was told was
complete bunk.
I also think if you had a chance to see their parts area you wouldn't order
from there, it was a disaster.
Anyway, sorry for the bandwidth, just adding my .02 and hoping that someone
else won't get taken
