David,
      Recently, a local tire shop damaged my wheels while mounting tires. I 
was polite but firm in discussing the issue with the manager and demanding 
that they pay to have the damage fixed. They agreed to pay, and I now have my 
wheels back from Rennsport, and they look brand new. With regards to your A/C 
problem from the towing company doing damage, demand that they pay to fix it. 
They should have insurance, if you have to, go through your own insurance 
company. There are way too many businesses doing a poor job of things, the 
more we as consumers don't put up with it the better.
Good Luck,
          Ezra
