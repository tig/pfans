I wonder if I might be missing something with this issue of the dim nature 
of the instrument cluster backlight.  From numerous posting, I arrived at 
the conclusion that this cluster was dim for everyone.  But recently, I've 
seen a couple of posts indicating that it could be caused by a blown bulb 
or simply additional resistance from dirt.  

Two ??s.
1) For the guys who have owned their cars since new or nearly new, was 
the cluster always dim?

2) Has anyone tried finding slightly higher wattage bulbs in the form 
factor for the cluster lights?  I "think" they are like 3w.  Maybe a couple of 
5s somewhere in the middle?

I have to pull apart my dash to reposition the tripmeter reset.  It seems a 
bit weird that this one piece wouldn't have a screw to hold the unit in the 
dash.   This time, I'll put a dab of silicon on th post to hold it still while I 
put the panel back in.
