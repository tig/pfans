>Dear NMA Member:
>
>We need your help in supporting an amendment to the proposed six-year
>federal highway bill, otherwise known as ISTEA.  The bill, offered by
>Senator James M. Inhofe (R-OK), makes a significant change in the
>Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program contained within the
>ISTEA law.
>
>CMAQ costs highway users about $1 billion annually and currently has a
>minimal impact on reducing congestion or improving air quality.  The monies
>have been spent on transit projects, carpool lanes, ride share programs,
>bicycle and pedestrian paths and other projects designed to decrease
>automobile travel.
>
>Presently CMAQ funds cannot be used for additional highway capacity, except
>high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.  For example, a state cannot use CMAQ
>funds to construct or lengthen a merge lane at a freeway interchange, even
>if the new merge lane would reduce rush hour backups and cut pollution,
>unless the merge lane is limited to carpool travellers only.  Since most of
>us drive alone, this prohibition prevents CMAQ from reducing congestion.
>
>Inhofe's amendment will allow states to spend CMAQ funds to expand bridges,
>upgrade roads, expand two-lane highways to four-lane highways and join
>major connectors to improve traffic flow, as long as congestion is reduced
>and air quality is improved.
>
>The House will adjourn in early November, so we need you to act NOW.
>Please contact both of  your U.S. Senators and urge them to support the
>Inhofe amendment.  You can use the Keep America Moving Hotline at
>1-800-308-6054, which allows callers to be switched to their senators free
>of charge.
>
>Thanks for your help!
