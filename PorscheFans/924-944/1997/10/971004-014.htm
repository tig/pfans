<< The dealer "Porsche" timing belt is stamped with a Pcar # and also says
 "Gates". I understand from a post written by a "Porschephile" that Gates is
 an OEM supplier to Porsche and the belt uses a HTD tooth profile (don't ask
 me what HTD is an acronym for)  So since the local NAPA store also carries
 Gates belts - You should look for the equivalent retail version of NAPA in
 the UK.  BTW the timing belt is now sold by the dealer for $19CDN and the
 balance shaft belt for $35CDN.-for 944NA and 951 (total 24 pounds sterling)
 It may be worthwhile to mailorder from the US or Canada if the price
 differential is this significant.

But doesn't the factory timing belt come with a two year warranty?  And if
I'm not mistaken, that warranty covers any damage resulting from breakage.
 If this is the case (which if it's not, I hope somebody speaks up) I would
gladly pay $20 more for that warranty.
