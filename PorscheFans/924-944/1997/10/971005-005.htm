Before getting to deep go to a parts store or sears and purchase an
"easy out". It fits on your drill bit and has reverse threads. It comes
with a drill bit size stamped on it. You 1st drill a hole of this size,
change bits to the easy out, and drill out at low speed.
And don't forget to change your thermostat while you are in there.
