<<Finally, the 1987 takes 87 octane (R+M/2) gasoline - does the 1988
require a higher octane fuel?>>

My '88 924S requires 91 octane at the pump as stated in both the manual and
on the inside of the gas filler door.  Since midgrade in my area is
consistently 89, that means I pay the extra for hi-test and end up buying 93
octane.  

As a side note to that, I wrote here several weeks ago regarding a strong
fuel odor in my car, especially in the garage, 30-60 minutes after shutting
off the engine.  After having my mechanic check a few things out, I
discovered that the odor went away with my next full tank when I switched to
Shell from Amoco.  I recalled that the odor appeared about when I started
using Amoco because my local Shell stopped their "Super Tuesdays".  Hmmmm.
 Not smelling any difference in the unburned gas (I've collected both in my
tank for my lawn mower), I conclude that there must be some additive in the
Amoco that must be causing the stench, and since it's happening after I shut
off the engine, I assume it's a component in the fuel that must remain
unburned and accumulate either in the exhaust or the charcoal canister.
 Probably the cheapest Porsche repair to date.

Also, I can now comment on the discussions that were present regarding the
pressure in the tank and the "whoosh" you hear when you unscrew the cap.  My
'88 example had never done that, unlike my '80 Scirroco which would really
whoosh.  However, when diagnosing for the fuel odor, my mechanic clamped shut
the hose going into the left front fender to the charcoal canister to test
it.  Well guess what?  Right.  That all of a sudden produced a strong
pressure in the gas tank and I had a real strong whoosh when removing the
cap.  Unclamping it made it not whoosh.  My suspician here is that there must
be some relief in the pressure going into the canister, and that relief is
causing the fuel odor to escape when I use Amoco gas.  Whether that is normal
or not - I don't know, but I can tell you that when we called to get a price
on a new canister, the dealer told us to save our money - as they had not
sold one of those in years.  And since the smell no longer exists when I use
Shell gas, I'm inclined to leave it alone.
