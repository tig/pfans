Lets be realistic here, Our cars are status symbols and there are a bunch
of people who own them not because of the glorious history of the crest,
but because it makes them feel important.

Here in Calgary there are alot of (NEW MONEY) Lawyers, CEO's, Exec's, who
are now driving there first Porsche, I have noticed their attitudes, like
when pulling into a gas station they look at you quickly and then do every
thing in their power not to look over again. Going out of their way not to
be friendly.

Now my suggestion is to challenge these people, there are lots of prople I
have met who have brand new Porsches and want to be just like you and me.

When I met a Lawyer with a beautiful C4S I asked him
	"Nice car, want to learn how to drive it?"
Boy did his eyes light up, gave me his card and went on our ways, sur
enough he was at our last drivers ed, even though I was not there he
dropped me a note to let me know how much fun he had.

Here is a test to see if you are a Enthusiast or a mere Collector!

	Do you prefere to do work on your car not because it saves you
money but because, you feel " if you want something done right do it
yourself" ?
	
	Has your significant other started to express interest in you car
possibly as a means to spend more time with you?

	Has your bathroom library been taken over by excelence, Pano,
Automotion and the Griots garage catalogue?
	
	Has your house library been taken over by these publications?

	Have you seriously considered remodeling the garage ?

	Do you have a remodeled garage?

	Have you ever pulled an all nighter to get you car ready for an
event, drive, date, or trip?

	Do you find yourself zoning out around mere mortals and in social
situations only to find salvation in thinking about your precious german
steed?

If your like me and I know you are then you know what it is like to fully
appreciate your car. 

If they only knew,

A.
