I can chime in here too.  I recently bought a set of 944 Workshop manuals 
from By Design.  I was told that they would be shipped Fed Ex 3 day.  They 
arrived 10 days later.  Then today when I got my AMX bill there is a second 
charge from By Design that I did not authorize.  Too bad too because their 
prices seemed OK.

P.S. The workshop manuals that I got are in grey binders but my Turbo 
supplement that I got some time ago is in a red one.  Is there a 
difference?  All of the photographs that I have seen of these manuals are 
with red binders???

Thanks!!!
