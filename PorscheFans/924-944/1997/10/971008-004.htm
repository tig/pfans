Excuse the tardiness in this reply... I'm a bit behind having spent the
weekend picking up a 928 in Virginia and driving it back to Michigan.

This is also probably the wrong place to be defending NSXs, but I can't
help myself.  I love Porsches, but I also happen to love NSXs.

What do mean "It is not that fast"???  Have you ever driven one?  I had
the opportunity several years ago when I was considering leasing one
(passed, next month found out my wife was pregnant - good decision, eh?).
I've never been in anything else that got to 100mph faster, or stopped
from 100 for that matter.  My subjective opinion, of course.

"for 80 grand you get a f***ing Honda".  Yeah, and for 75 grand you get
a Dodge.  What's your point?

"and sure as hell doesn't make MY heart race the way a Viper does" or like
the repair bills for my Porsches... (just kidding - but the NSX has been
ranked as THE most reliable used car by JD Power).

Of course, you are right that I wouldn't pay $80K for a new NSX.  I didn't
pay $70K for a new 928 back in 1987, either.  I paid $6200 for my 944 last
year and $15600 for my 928 (in very good condition, by the way).  Low 
mileage
NSXs are still around $40K, which puts them way out of my price range!  If
these are such bad cars, why do they have such high resale value?

Don't get me wrong... after all, I do own two Porsches and no NSXs.  But if
the right opportunity comes up, I'd love to add one to my fleet.
