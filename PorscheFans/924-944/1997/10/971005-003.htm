i have one my roomate has the other (it still makes him grin to go out in my
944). At any rate i think the boxster has become what my roomate and i call
a car that attracts butterfly collared, ugly chain wearing, car salesman!!
because it is not very expensive every tom,dick, and A-Hole can afford one.
now these people know dick about cars but because they have a Porsche or a
Corvette they think they are hot shit. it is a huge shame that there is no
test to pass before you buy a car, maybe then status seakers would stick to
Mercedes, Jaguar, and Whatever else floats their boats..... Both my roomate
and i are under 20 and here are other things of note.

1)  people of our age group think it is cool that we have neat cars.
2)  people in the 20-45 age group think it is great that we are carrying on
the sports car tradition
3)  people in the over 45 age group have seemed (in general) to be the
biggest a**holes, their attitude is that we didnt work for our cars so we
dont deserve to have them.  In my case when i was having it worked on the
guy asked how long my dad had had it and i said its mine, he said yeah
right.  i actually did work for mine so this attitude really angers me.
