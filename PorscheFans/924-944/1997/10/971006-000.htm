Hello all. Have a few questions for you all if you don't mind. I'll be
returning from Japan to Massachusetts with my wife in about six months
and I am thinking of buying a 944 for myself and a welcome home present
;^). Actually I always wanted one and now I can afford one (well I can
BUY it at least....) My plan is this:

Buy a VW GTI 16v for my main transportation and then start searching.

I like the 944 for many reasons and prefer it over the 911 particularly
because I am married and my wife hates really rough riding cars (didn't
like my old GTI after my tinkering). Also they seem to be relatively
affordable. 911s are probably out of my realistic range (up to $12k)

I am considering the 944 and the 944s as the 951 is probably beyond my
maintenance budget. And therein lies the real crux of my dilemma.
Exactly how expensive are these cars to own and take care of?

I have read the faq, checked various 944 home pages and i have come away

with mixed feelings. It appears, logically so, that well maintained cars

serve well and are quite reliable. I need opinions, testimony, etc.

I plan to pay cash so I'll have no payments to worry about. I also used
to sink WAY too much money into my GTI's (with little to no return on my

investment) so I don't mind paying a little to keep it up. What are
parts prices like? A motor rebuild? a rebuilt tranny? (vertex quotes
about $1200, which isn't much more than my GTI trannys cost).

I am also BTW considering a 928 (afraid of the bills on that one...) or
a BMW 535is (circa 1988). Another budget choice would be to get a GTI
VR6, but then I am giving up a life long dream of owning a Porsche. And
besides my wife says it's ok, as long as I'm happy :-)

Any advice, experiences, testimony, opinions ANYTHING would be
ENORMOUSLY appreciated

TIA

Matthew Twigg
