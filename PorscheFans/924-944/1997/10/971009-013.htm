JACK PAD UPDATE: I just wanted you to know that the jack pads that you 
expressed interest in recently are for the 944 series (1985 1/2-91), and 
the 968. They also work with the 911 Carrera 2/4 and the 993.
I apologize for any confusion.

Let me know if you are interested. 


Great News!!!

I have fabricated a rubber jack pad for lifting the 944(1985 1/2-91) 968, 
Carrera 2/4 and 993 series. When a pad is not used you could be damaging 
the SKS undercoating and the underside of the car! The pad which is 
fabricated from a hard rubber material will not damage the jack point 
areas or unnecessarily remove the protective SKS. It is very similar to 
the factory pad that was used on the assembly line during production.
It is also designed to mate to the reccomended lifting points, avoiding 
any slipping that may occur during the lifting process. I have tested it 
several times and it insures a stable mount between the car and jack. It 
is much better then anything I have ever seen from any of the mail order 
companies. It will also work with the 951 model, not causing any damage 
to the lower plastic trim.
