Right up front, I'll say sorry for wasting bandwidth.
Sorry.

I know this has been discussed but, as I didn't have any problem, it went 
in one eye and out the other.  Last night my clutch pedal stuck about 1 
inch from the floor.  As I was only a block from home, I made it in first 
gear.  Reaching down, I was able to pull it back.  There was a little smooth 
resistance, then what felt like a pop and it swung all the way back up.  
Playing with it, it will work a handful of times, then tighten up a bit and 
then stick again.

As background, I just had my clutch master and slave cylinders replaced 
about 3 weeks ago along with the line from the master cylinder to the 
brake master cylinder.  The fluid is still full, it doesn't look like I've lost 
any.  Can anybody help me out?

Somehow, unfortunately, EVERY repair I have had done to this car since 
I bought it has resulted in another problem in the same system.
1) A/C service.  Blown compressor seal.
2) Clutch master/slave replacement.  Sticking clutch pedal.
3) New belts, rollers and tuneup.  Car louder and rougher.  It was 
"purrfect" before the tuneup but I wanted peace of mind.
4) New alarm.  1 dead brain, 1 headlight motor relay, 1 blown fuse and 
po'd neighbors.

I'd love to start doing my own work but I just don't have the time.  Just 
goes to show that nobody loves your car like you do.  My current favorite 
line came from the installation manager at the "factory approved" Clifford 
alarm installer.  "I've seen electrical problems spontaneously appear right 
after we installed alarms on a number of European vehicles".  And he said 
it with a straight face.

<whine off>

Anyway, if someone can help me with my clutch problem, I'd appreciate 
it.  Hmmm...I wonder how the battery charge is on my FJ?  And where 
are those flannel-lined jeans?
