Hi BadBob,

I'm reposting this, because I think the List was down when I sent it.  =
please
forgive me if I'm wrong.

All,

Has anyone installed a Weltmeister Chip in a 951?  If so , how long did =
it
take to install the shim on the wastegate?

[J. Dean Roberson]  It took me several hours.  A 10 year old exhaust =
component sometimes takes a while to get it to release it's rusty grip.  =
A little heat from the torch was required for mine.  Also, the mounting =
bolts for the wastegate to the chassis are a bear to get off, and a hell =
of a bear to get re-installed.  Have plenty of 3/8" drive extensions, a =
3/8" drive universal joint, and LOTS of patience.=20

Also, be very careful when removing the wastegate valve and be sure that =
the diaphram side doesn't turn while you unscreww the valve.  I don't =
even want to ask the cost of a new anything for the wastegate.

BTW, If you would even consider going back stock, I would just find a =
used wastegate and keep it on the shelf.  Not cheap, but an easier =
changeover back to stock.  Or, just get a used wastegate to shim if you =
want to experiment.  Used wastegates shouldn't be too expensive - I =
hope?

I do feel that shimming or changing the wastegate spring is a better =
upgrade though.  It makes sense and should make the higher boost levels =
easier to modulate.  The car does have much better bottom end and a =
smoother boost profile with a max boost of 1.9 bar.  The conversion is =
*much* more work than the Autothority upgrade, but only the AutoX/racer =
guys could tell you which is better.  I ran my 951 for 10K miles with =
the Weltmeister upgrade and it seemed really good to me.

If this in the least scares you, just do the Autothority upgrade.  No =
under car work needed.  (Of course, you still have to dig out the =
computers from  the floor board - be careful with them 10 year-old PC =
boards!).

Last thing - Automotion should be heavily brow-beaten for not telling =
purchasers in the catalog that the shim installation is required with =
the 951 chip.  I complained enough to get a free K&N filter, but it =
doesn't make up for the labor hours and the fact that most people expect =
a chip upgrade to just be a chip installation.

Just my advice.
