OK, this'll probably really mess things up: not only is my 77 924 an NA
model and an automatic, it's also Cal. spec! This means it has some extra
components in the PCV system, including something called a diverter
valve, which I suspect is what does this oil control. It's connected to the
air pump, above the air filter, and the check valve to the brakes. I also
have a cat, though it doesn't figure in this problem. Has anyone out there
messed with this? I've been wondering if it's letting an excessive amount
of oil into my intake for burning, since I'm losing quite a bit of oil, and not
really much from apparent leaks. However, I've got lots of oil pressure
and power, so the engine's not shot. I wonder if this doohickey needs
adjusting - it looks like it can by a screw on the back.

Anyone BTDT?
