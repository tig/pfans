Tony:

As far as I'm concerned those "blue book" prices are a bunch of
horse*#@%!  You said that the book said that your 924S was worth $2300?!
Ask yourself this...when was the last time you saw a 924S for sale at
that price that was still running?  Right.  They don't exist, unless
it's a desperation sale or somebody's wife is dumping it cause the guy's
cheating on her and she's pissed.  

If there is any price differential between the two it's probably due to
the stigma that the 924S is a 924.  Even the 924's deserve better than
that.  $2300...those are Yugo prices.  Geez...I think I feel ill.

I'm not flaming on you, so please don't take it that way.  It's the fact
that those blue books are so bogus.  That's a banker and dealer ploy to
give you nothing on your car for a trade in or loan.  So when you think
about blue book prices...think to yourself when was the last time a
banker or dealer did you a favor. :) ;) :)
