        I'm glad to hear that your car is now running and starting fine.
But just in case you have trouble again and can't figure out why, make sure
the alternator light in your dash panel (in the lower Voltage meter field)
lights briefly with all of your other warning lights as you start the car.
I'm actually not sure if the 924S dash is different from the 85.5 944/951
dash, but if it's the same or has a similar warning light, then the same
principles may/should apply.  Your alternator will NOT charge the battery if
this bulb is burned out or not lighting because it needs this resistor to
complete the circuit which excites the electric field or something for the
alternator.  It is an item that doesn't fail often, but it has happened in
944s and is a more common problem in 911s.  If your bulb is not burnt out
but still doesn't light, check (and you'll probably end up bypassing it)
your factory alarm circuitry located in the car's computer board in the
passenger-side footwell.
        I chased a power-drain/dead battery problem similar to yours for
almost 3 years before I finally found the problem (I know, I'm a lucky idiot
but I only drive my car during the summer and holiday breaks from college
and it's hard to diagnose a problem like this when my driving intervals make
the car prone to other little problems associated with "sitting syndrome").
My alternator warning light never lit since I bought the car so I never
noticed that it was missing (not flashing) when I started the car.  The car
would always start and run fine if I drove it every day.  But if I left it
to sit for a week at a time (while I was away at school), my dad would tell
me that the car wouldn't start unless he charged the battery the night
before.  We got a new battery when we found out the old one was toast.  At
first, we weren't surprised because it was the battery that came in the car
when we bought it and it had no label or stamp that indicated how old it
was.  Of course with the new battery, he was able to start it on the first
crank every time for the rest of the winter only because it was fresh.  The
car drove fine over the following summer (thank heaven above I was never
stranded), but problems resumed that next winter.  It got to the point where
we charged the car and it would need to be charged again every week.  That's
when we knew something else was fishy (besides the battery and my friend's
944's taillight lens).  I wasn't able to resolve my charging problem until
this past summer when I gave up and took it to my mechanic, who bypassed my
factory alarm after my 951 died in the shop's garage.  Don't ask my why or
how, but that's what fixed it forever.  All I know is that a wire in the
circuit was burnt to a crisp from heat build-up.  I had had trouble with the
factory alarm before and I'm glad it's gone.  Well, it's still there but
I've put it to rest I think.  I hope there won't be a third Steven King
sequel to this story where it comes back to life to haunt me again.  If
anyone else want to banish their evil alarm too, I think it's just a matter
of unsnapping a small wiring harness.
        Sorry this was so long, but I'm hoping this info can help someone
else too.  Me, I'm just a really lucky fool who should have known that his
voltage meter should flash a warning light too every time his girlfriend
stalls the car.
