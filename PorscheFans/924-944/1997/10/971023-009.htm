Not to drag on the ongoing epedemic of dim dash lights but, has anybody
ever measured the voltage going to these lamps with a voltmeter??? I would
check the voltage at the bulb then compare it to the voltage at the battey.
(dimmer should be all the way up.) If you find that there is a difference
than you can narrow down the voltage drop to either the ground or the power
supplyed to the bulbs. To check the ground, place one lead form the
voltmeter on the batteys negitive (-) post then, the other lead at the
bulbs ground. There should not be a greater drop than .5volts. Ok now for
the positive side. Place one lead of the voltmeter on the batterys positive
(+) post then the other lead on the power wire to the bulbs. Again there
should be little voltage drop here. Maybe .5 - 1.0 can be acceptable. Using
the method I just described above you may need to extend the leads on youre
voltmeter with a few feet of wire.. 
The PO of my car had the dash lights wired strait from the fusebox
eliminating the dimmer circuit all together, I particularly dont like this
and plan on changing it this winter when I put the car away.

Good Luck!
