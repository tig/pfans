<< 	haha... so true, but worst yet, its the insurance companys scape
 goat.  I bought a car for 8500 (9100 or so after tax and all that other
 stuff), and some guy totaled my car by rear-ending me while I was at a
 complete stop at a stop light.  I had the car for less than a month (~29
 days actually).  The insurance comp. told me their books said it was
 worth only 7400.  I called the car dealer I bought the car from, and he
 told me I paid under the going value for the car (it was a trade-in)...
 
 But loosing $1100 or so is less than the cost of taking them to court...
 so ripped off yet again. >>

P-fans,

Always remember that you don't have to put up with this crap (Ezra knows this
when he fought to get his rims repaired)!  My daughter was in an accident
(not her fault) and when the insurance company decided to total her car with
a ridiculously-low blue book value, I fought it.  I went to some local
dealers that had similar cars and got them to give me written quotations for
the prices they were asking.  I presented these to the insurance company as
proof of real value and they hardly hesitated as they changed their mind and
proceeded to fix the car.

Sometimes you just have to show them how the real world operates!
