Hi,

I've owned my '83 944 for almost a year now and it been very reliable up
till just yesterday, now she just doesn't want to start.  I've been
through all the basics, checked fuel pump voltage, checked for ignition
spark, checked for fuel delivery to injectors (although didn't actually
measure the fuel pressure).  Anyway I'm not sure where to go from here
(besides my mechanic).  I'm also not sure if this is related but my 944
starting problem but for the last week or so the 944 has been running
very rough at idle, to the point of almost stalling at each stop light.
This would happen during one trip (running rough) then the next trip it
might run smooth again, it seemed almost random.  But I never had
problems starting until yesterday, as a matter of fact she would start
up right away within maybe half a second of turning the key.

If anyone has a response could you also forward it to Michelleh@pdq.net
I will be at my sisters house this weekend trying to breath back life
into my '83 '44.

Thanks for your help.
