I posted this question last week but it didn't make it to the list.
Last week I replaced and repacked my front wheel bearings. After 
getting everything back together the hubs would turn only with a 
great deal of force. They turn easily without the brake calipers on. 
I have done the bearings before without this occuring. The only thing 
I did differently was that the calipers were off and hung by wire for 
three days. Do I need to bleed the brakes? If so, can I bleed just 
the fronts or do I have to do all?

If anyone has any ideas on how to correct this please reply directly 
as I get this in digest form and would like to fix it tonight while 
the car is in the air.  

Thanks in advance
