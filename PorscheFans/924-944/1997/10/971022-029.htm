Just a note for those interested.

I put a MOMO wheel in my '87 951 in July.  I had to buy a used steering
column switch from Partsheaven, along with the associated trim pieces from an
'86 951.  The airbag wheel, the original switch and the special
spring/contact cassette are sitting in a box in my garage.

To get the horn to work, you have to remove the small connector on the horn
wire (see schematic in Turbo manual) and replace it with a small female
connector which you can get at Radio Shack.  Then you have to plug it onto
the proper pin on the used switch assembly.

In addition to all of this, you have to clip/jumper some wires to the airbag
computer under/behind the glove box or the car will not start.

Would be happy to provide more detalis if anyone is interested.  My phone
number is (510) 713-9248.  Don't call this weekend because!!!!!!:

Friday: 	Laguna Seca (watching and hob nobbing)
Saturday:	Sears Point (driving my 951!!!!!)
Sunday:	Back to Laguna to watch Porsches kick ass.
