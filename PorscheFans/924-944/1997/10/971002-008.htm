     Michael,
     
     Neither the oil pump nor the oil pan need be removed to replace the 
     front main shaft seal.  However, the pulley on the main shaft does and 
     the bolt securing it is a bear to remove.  I ended up removing the 
     radiator to make room for my impact wrench.
     
     Regards,
     John ('89 944, 2.7l)
