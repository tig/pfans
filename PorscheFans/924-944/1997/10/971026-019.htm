I wrote an article for our PCA newsletter some time ago about minding all 
matters regarding oil in 944s, just after having rebuilt a 944S for a very
unfortunate customer.    The car had about 100K on it.   One cam had several
pitted lobes and both sprockets had broken teeth.    If one presumes that the
design is basically sound, and I see no reason that it is not, then you can only
conclude that doing everything you can to maintain proper lubrication should
be on the top of every 944S driver's list.   This would simply boil down to
having
plenty of fresh oil of the right weight.    The utter fools who are
currently recommending
the use of 10W30 during the summer because the car runs smoother at warmup
WILL be amongst the population who shed a rod bearing or flatten their cams
early.

My logic led me to recommending  preventative replacement of the oil cooler
o-rings and the cam chain and tensioner.    Beyond that perhaps it is a
crapshoot.

I would like to know what the mechanic thinks the cause is on those early
failures.
