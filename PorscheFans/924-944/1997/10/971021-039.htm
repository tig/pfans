Someone had asked about a discrepancy with his ins agent concerning 
his VIN on an early 924.  As you believed, yours was indeed a European 
version.  The early VIN's work like this:

From 77-79 924 chassis #'s were ten digits.
type-924  model year-7  version-1  ser #-00001-on

versions: 1=Europe  2=USA, Calif.  3=Japan  4=Turbo; Europe, RoW
5=Turbo; USA, Japan

While I was looking in this book, I saw the production volume data for 
all markets.  Since I have an 82 931, I thought I would share that 
data with my fellow 931 brethren.

         924 turbo
model year     quantity produced
78             86
79             5023
80             3044
81             3578
82             444
83             210
924 turbo total=12385
924 Carrera GT(80) 406 (including prototypes)
924 Carrera GTS(81) 59 (of which 19 were GTR)

These were the quantities supplied to all markets.  The 83's are 
actually 82's that were left over and shipped to Italy.  I'll bet 
there's a new one for sale over there still...

I got all this info from a book called "The Porsche 924/944 Book."  It 
is loaded with data like above, if you're interested.  The Author was 
Peter Morgan.
