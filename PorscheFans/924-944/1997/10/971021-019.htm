This is my first posting so I would like to thank every one on P-fans for the 
very informative postings.  I would also like to thank Don Istook, Jim Richmond, 
Chris Hanlo, George B., Claus Groth, Jason Lee, Bob Norman and many others for 
all their help and guidance.

My car is an '89 951 with 110K miles. At the last track event "Rockingham, NC", 
the car started to puff blue smoke on de-acceleration. My mechanic diagnosed the 
problem as worn Valve Guides and/or Turbo seals, well I had him fix both. Now 
the problem is more severe, and oil consumption has gone up!!! Compression and a 
leakdown tests were performed with acceptable results. It appears that I have a 
broken oil ring (scratch on #2 Cyl. Wall), but will not know for sure till the 
pistons are out. Before I commit to any work, I'm investigating few mods, any 
input will be appreciated.

- In order to fix the Cyl. Wall I could have the block honed (special process) 
or I could have it sleeved (Iron sleeves). Any pros/cons?

- I'm thinking of using a 2.8L stroker kit. I understand the low and midrange 
power will be greatly improved. Is there a negative side to this conversion?

- Are there any known problems with the 944T engine, that I might need to 
address while the engine is apart? 

All suggestions will be appreciated!
