Paul, 

        Bingo! Pulled the trigger today. 1990 S2 with 78,000 miles. White
with cloth interior-sort of a black and white plaid. Drove from Fort Myers
today with my mechanic 180 miles and we checked it out together. Car runs
very strongly. Needs some minor paint work on the nose and dam due mostly to
stone chips, needs new stonegards, needs some polishing and refinishing of
the wheels. Though there were  no records my mechanic felt the car has been
reasonably well cared for- the engine looked as though nobody had done any
thing  unusual to it and we are as certain as possible that it has not been
in an accident. We are planning to do a major service in the next few days
to be sure we have no disasters befall us. The air blows icey cold
Hallelujah!!. The car is very quiet inside (unlike my 911 Targa). Only
unhappy spot is the front seats which are stained (they might clean up) and
the left bolster of the driver's seat is showing lots of foam. Checked with
Porsche and the seat cover costs a mere $600 only for the top. Unfortunately
due to fading in an eight year old car the new back would probably look very
different from the rest so I will probably have to recover the front seats.

        The happy part is the dealer was asking $13000 and I pushed and
prodded till we reached $9500. I figure  that if I go crazy and spend $3000
I will have an excellent car for about $12500. I now see how the 944 family
is similar to the 911 family in it's bugaboos. Glove box broken ($800 at
Porsche- I don't think so). Any suggestions? Slight leak in hatch (one place
for sure is the grommet or gasket around the rear wiper but some dampness in
the right rear wheel well). Will have to reread the FAQ on that one. Again
any suggestions? Leather on the shift knob starting to tear. I noticed a
place in Panorama that sells a repair kit. Anybody have any experience with
this?

        Paul, I'm sending a copy of this to the digest. I want to thank all
of you who sent advice and encouragement. I drove the car 185 miles today
and enjoyed every minute of it. My wife tried it when I got home and she
found it much easier to drive than the 911 so that went well too. Thanks
again. Will keep in touch. I'm sure I will have more questions.
