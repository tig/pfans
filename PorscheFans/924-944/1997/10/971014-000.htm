Well, you did say ANY advice.  How about a parallel?  I recently had all 
the belts, tensioners,etc replaced on my 88 951 and have since noticed a 
vibration through the gearshift at EXACTLY 3000.  Not at 2900 and gone 
by 3200.  I'm hoping the belt retension makes it go away.

From what I've read, engine mount problems resonate at lower rpm freqs 
(below 1200rpm) but I suppose it's nice to know you won't have problems 
in the near future with them.  

Anyway, you may want to check or have someone else check the belts.  
It's relatively cheap shop time wise and who knows, there may be 
something to it.
