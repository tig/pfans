I would remove the battery, take it to Discount Auto or equivelant where you
live and have it checked for free.  I don't know where you live, but here in
Florida if a battery lasts beyond two years, you kiss the sales guy at the store
you bought it from, wax the car again for good luck and go ahead and set money
aside for the new one that will be needed shortly.  Now, if the car is garaged
all the time (most Porsche's are), and the battery is kept charged (recharged
occasionally if the car isn't driven much) then you can typically get over two
years, but not a lot over that.  The heat cooks them I'm told.  Anyway, it
sounds like you may have a dead cell.  Recharging by driving the car isn't the
best way either.  It typically takes all night to fully recharge a dead battery
on a charger, so I doubt a 30 minute drive would fully charge it.  Especially if
not on the highway with high Rpms.  Remember the charging systems works off
engine speed.  Low Rpm's don't help it much.  When you brought it home and it
restarted, doesn't mean the battery is ok.  Even a totally dead battery cell
will hold a charge for an hour (unless it's shorted).  Have the battery load
tested, if it's not that then go to the old amp draw/pull fuses technique to
find which circuit is pulling current.  Good luck.
