Fans!

        I need some advice as to how to proceed. I'll be as brief as
possible. Last Wednesday I bought a 1990 S2. My mechanic went with me and we
went over the car with a fine tooth comb. Friday as I was driving home from
work (with the car making wonderful icy cold air- one of the main reasons I
bought it) I heard a thump and the AC went off and the charging meter ceased
to register. I found a broken belt and then tried to get home but the car
quit quickly thereafter. I called a hauler and they came quickly. I
expressed concern about how the car would be put on the hauler but the
driver said no problem, I've done this before I have two planks. The car
seemed to go on well enough and we brought it to my mechanics house. The
driver began to offload it very close to the garage in the driveway which
sloped down toward the street. The car did not have room to come completely
off the hauler and I thought he would put it back on and move forward and
unload it again. Instead, he drove out from underneath the car letting it
thump on the driveway. I wasn't crazy about it but nothing on the dam
appeared to be broken and I paid the driver and signed the receipt he gave me.

        That was last Friday. My mechanic charged the battery and drove the
car five minutes to his shop to do the major service that we had planned on
Monday. Tuesday he called me a said he had done the service and the car was
running fine but not making any air and when he checked the system out it
was extremely low on Freon. Checking further he found that the condenser was
holed out and a metal hose leading to the condenser which was supposed to
have a right angle bend had more than a forty five degree bend effectively
kinking it. The repair including condenser, hose, dryer and switch (which
the mechanic recommended) and freon and labor came out to over $700.00.

        I called the towing company on Tuesday after telling the mechanic to
go ahead with the repair as I needed the car. The lady who answered asked
for particulars and I gave them saying that I was not ranting and raving but
that I thought they should help out with the cost of the repair. They sent
one of their driver's over who looked at the car and informed me that
nothing had been broken where they had hooked on to the car. I explained the
problem with the offloading and he said he wouldn't know what to tell me and
there we stand. I have not heard from them again and my guess is they are
not much interested in doing anything.

        Do I just grin and bear it or is there anything I can do? TIA
