Dave,

>>fuel pumps- 7.5 amps current draw (should be ok)

Is this after the car starts to exibit the problem?  I used to have a
rabbit that did the same thing, and ultimatly, the fuel pump was building
up too much resistance after running a while.  It even melted the fuse box
twice, but since the dealer was fixing it as a warantee, I didn't argue.
(I also had no idea he was replacing the fuse with a slow-blow type)

I would check the fuel pump after the problem is occurring.  I would also
bet that the fuel pump is bad.....(just my .02 cents)

Best regards,


Darryl Snover
