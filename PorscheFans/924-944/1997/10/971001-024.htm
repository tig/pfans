I feel I must pass this on to my fellow P-Fans.  Please forward this to =
anyone and any other lists appropriate.

I just got off the phone with Tim Dunlevy, the president and owner of =
Tweeks.  This is an accounting of the problems I have had with his =
organization recently.  Remember this is the first time I attempted to =
purchase from Tweeks.

On July 1 of this year I ordered a car cover and a windshield sun shade. =
 I was told by the salesperson the cover I had selected was the best at =
keeping moisture of the vehicle and that by using the cover, if the car =
sat outside overnight, it I wouldn't have water (dew) marks on the =
finish when I removed the cover the next day.  I was also told a free =
cover bag was shipped with each car cover.  The text in the catalog =
reinforced this perception.  The photo of the cover in the catalog did =
not show a logo or anything else printed on the cover.  I was told both =
the cover and the windshield shade would arrive in 10-15 days directly =
from the manufacturer.

The cover (without the cover bag) arrived in the period described but =
when I put it on the car I was horrified to find a large "Tweeks" and =
their 800 sales number on the front of the cover.  I took the cover off =
the car and call customer service at Tweeks.  I told customer service =
the logo and 800 number were unacceptable.  The cs person was surprised =
there was a logo and number on the cover.  He checked with someone and =
then told me this was something the owner had just started and not told =
the sales people about.  He would be happy to exchange it for me.  Since =
I was going to a couple of track events and had wanted the cover for =
these events and it would take another 10-15 days to get the replacement =
cover, I asked the cs person if I could keep and use the cover until the =
replacement arrived.  He said :Yes, that would be fine."  (Note: I =
didn't use the cover at the events. I forgot it at home.)

Upon arriving home from the track events I had a message on my machine =
from Tweeks.  I called them back and they said they couldn't ship the =
new cover because my credit card had been declined.  I asked what they =
were attempting to charge and I was told the replacement cover.  I told =
them no one had told me I had to pay for the second cover first, in fact =
I was told it would be an exchange.  They said they couldn't do this.  I =
was a little pissed off at this point with all the run-around so I asked =
to speak to the owner, Mr. Dunlevy.  Mr. Dunlevy took my call, =
reluctantly agreed to do ship out the new cover before receiving the =
first cover but I was taken at how unpleasant he was.  He didn't seem to =
care about me or my experiences as a first time customer to Tweeks.  =
(Note: I still had not received the sunshade.)

Finally in early August, better than 5 weeks after the initial order I =
received the cover.  This time it arrived with the cover bag.  I tried =
the cover soon thereafter and found out it didn't do what I had been =
told it would do.  After removing the cover one morning there was all =
over the car.  I was terribly disappointed.  I called Tweeks where I was =
told since it had been on the car they couldn't take it back.  When I =
asked what I was supposed to do with a cover that didn't do what I =
wanted I didn't get a decent answer.

Meanwhile, I inquired about the sunshade.  I was told my credit card was =
billed on 8/13/97 and the sun shade was drop shipped from the =
manufacturer.  Finally on 9/4/97 John in Tweeks customer service told me =
the sun shade hadn't shipped because the manufacturer had billing =
problems with Tweeks but that had just been cleared up and the sun shade =
would ship that day.  I cancelled the order because with the summer over =
I didn't need it any more.

I called my credit card company who told me to send both covers back =
with a letter stating why I was returning them and that expected a =
credit to my account.  I did this but Tweeks refused to take back the =
second cover saying it had been used.  When I talked again to Mr. =
Dunlevy attempting to explain to him there was no way I could have known =
about the cover without putting it on the car and using it, he became =
very agitated and began to yell at me.  He accused me of being the type =
of customer trying to take advantage of him and that he would stand for =
it.  I remained calm and he finally agreed to take the cover back.

Well today, after checking with my credit card company and still not =
receiving a credit, I called Tweeks again.  I ended up speaking with Mr. =
Dunlevy again.  In the process he yelled at me, used foul language and =
refused to accept the second cover because it had been used.  When I =
asked him to not speak to me in such a unprofessional manner he said is =
was my fault for getting him so worked up.  When I suggested I would =
share my experience with my internet colleagues he threatened me with =
legal action.

My Porsche Colleagues, do what you want with my experience, however I =
would suggest we must vote with our $$ to demonstrate to parts retailers =
what we expect the level of service to be.  I submit Tweeks is not a =
customer service oriented organization.
