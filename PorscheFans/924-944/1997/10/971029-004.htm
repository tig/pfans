My thanks to all who responded also!!

I had the same symptom as Mark (see following) but with a different
solution:

The 'little black wire' from the antenna cable WAS connected to a switched
+12v source.

The AM section of the radio, Blaupundt Reno, is good.

The antenna amplifier is good.  No apparent smoked components and +12v when
the radio is on.
(located on the passenger side, behind the glove box, just inside the dash
lip, attached to the body with a single bolt.  It's a little back plastic
box  about 2 1/2" by 2 1/2" and the ONLY was to see it is on your back, head
first under the dash)

Problem:  Intermittent connection where the antenna cable from the radio
attaches to the antenna amplifier.  Jiggle (technical term) the antenna
cable with the radio on and set to an AM station and viola - AM reception!

Thanks again!

Thanks to all who replied!
Here's what we got from the antenna problem.  A little black wire comes out
of the shielding of the thick black antenna wire.  It is normally connected
by a small, one wire harness to two red wires.  I snipped the little black
wire free from the small harness and then spliced it into the switched power
wires (green).
