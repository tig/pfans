 I just installed a new stereo in my 944 Turbo.  FYI, here are the wiring
colors:

Brown --> Ground
Green --> Switched power (Ignition)
Red w/white stripe --> constant power
Red and brown --> Right Rear speaker
Yellow and brown --> Left Rear speaker
White and brown --> Left Front speaker
I don't remember --> Right Front speaker

I had some trouble with the constant power and ended up snaking a wire
through
the firewall from the batter to the stereo for constant power.  Works great
and
I learned how to remove the glove compartment.  When I cut the wires from
the
bracket from the original Blaupunkt (Monterey), I left the inner red wires
in
tact.  I'm not sure what they're for but I didn't want to get slash-happy
gutting everything.

On to the question.  FM reception comes in just fine.  AM reception is
horrible.  I looked at the 944 FAQ.  It is somewhat vague about how to
resolve
this.  Here is what I have:

 Brown (Ground)                       Black for ground
 Green (Switch)                        Red for switch
 Red w/stripe (Constant)       Yellow for constant
 Antenna with extra wire         Blue for power antenna

I don't  have the blue wire on the radio connected to anything.  The antenna
is
plugged into the radio.  What is the little black wire on the antenna lead
for?  Am I supposed to splice the blue power antenna wire in to the little
black wire?  As you know, the car's antenna is integrated into the
windshield
so right now the power antenna lead from the radio is just hanging there.
Help!
