Khal,
I a glad to someone else agrees with me about the differences in the NA
and Turbo.
I too have had problems getting used to the boost in the twisties.  I am
learning though and one thing I have noticed is the best thing is to
keep the car in the "on boost mode" that is keep the boost gauge at or
near 1.0 (dash gauge). this way you can throttle stear the car smoothly
(probablylike you used to drive your NA). Now, the gears are much higher
in the Turbo so you may be in a gear lower in some turns than you were
in your NA. This seems to have increased my smoothness a lot with the
951. The only thing is you will be going a lot FASTER than you were in
your NA, which we should all be careful of on public roads!

If any experienced 951 drivers care to comment please do!!!!
