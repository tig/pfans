Haha, I love this WOT title :)  It suits me so well, I'm always spinning
out because I don't want to lift.  My excuse is always the same too,
"but the boost felt so good, I didn't want it to stop!"

You would put a bleeder on the line going from the intake to the cycling
valve, or in easier terms, the line that attaches to the boost bolt.

If you are going to go to that step, you would be better off using an
electronic boost controller, like an EVC from HKS.  I've never used a
device on my car I've liked more that the EVC I had on the Talon.  The
major benefits of these units is not so much the "on-the-fly" cockpit
controllable boost, but rather how it brings on the boost.  Because it
keeps the wastegate completely shut during boost build-up, it reduces
lag time and can increase the boost in the lower gears where the engine
sees reduced loads.  When the unit senses that we are reaching the set
boost point, it pre-loads the wastegate with pressure so that it can
open immediately as soon as the boost pressure is reached.  This
prevents spikes, overboost and underboost.  The most sophisticated boost
controller available right now is the EVC IV ATM.  The ATM is an awesome
function.  It determines what the atmospheric pressure is and then
adds the boost onto that.  To give you an example:

Normal boost controllers and factory controllers:
Location         Atmospheric Press.     Boost Press.     Absolute Press.
Sea level              14.5psi             14.5psi            29psi
High altitiude         12.5psi             14.5psi            27psi

HKS EVC ATM
Location         Atmospheric Press.     Boost Press.     Absolute Press.
Sea level              14.5psi             14.5psi            29psi
High altitiude         12.5psi             16.5psi            29psi

This method also ensures that if a cold night is out, you don't get overboost
and if it's hot out, it will increase the boost level until it reaches
the absolute pressure set.  The unit also comes with what is called a 
"Scramble Boost Controller" or SBC for short.  It used to be a seperate
box, but now it's part of the EVC IV.  This button, which can be
mounted like a nitrous switch, allows an overboost for a period of time,
so for psychos like Hansmen [:)], they can program it to run 18psi of
boost for 10 seconds after the trigger is hit, so when that pesky new
Camaro comes up to you, let him hang on for a bit, then SBC them into
the rearview mirror.

The HKS EVC IV also comes with a digital boost gauge built in which
saves you a bit of money.  In the past, HKS had a kit that would work
with the 944T's external wastegate, but I've heard it was troublesome.
You can always hook it up just like a bleeder, but to be completely
effective, you want it to hook right to the wastegate and to bypass all
of the factory systems.  You may need an HKS external wastegate to work
correctly with the EVC.  There are many other wastegates available like
the Deltagate, etc, but the HKS type "R" wastegate is the only one I
know that worked on Buschur's 10 second Talon.

No, but there is some work around for that to some extent.  Any change
you do will be a delta change.  So, if you increase boost by 0.2bar,
that will cut the KLR's boost reduction ability by 0.2bar if you leave
the remainder of the system intact.  So, if you are bleeding 0.2bar out
to raise boost from 0.8 to 1.0bar and your KLR detects knock, it will
be able to bring the boost down to only 0.4 bar rather than the normal
0.2 bar.  My thought on that is, if your car has knock at 0.4 bar, you
have something seriously wrong!

Now, if you drill your cycling valve, the KLR has NO control whatsoever
on the boost and it will detonate to pieces before it can do anything.
All the KLR will do is tell the DME to enrich the mixture and cut the
timing, but it won't be able to dial back the boost.  Same goes for
a proper EVC setup.

I always hated octane boosters because of the red color it leaves on
your spark plugs, so one day, I finally convinced a chemistry professor
at a local university to do some tests for me.  He was checking the octane
rating of fuels and octane booster and it's effects on the fuel.  I'll
summarize the results and if someone wants, I can dig up the whole report:

1. Chevron gas in Western Canada is the best for knock resistance and overall
   quality of fuel.
2. US border gas is the worst 91 octane available.  Any Canadian gas will
   be better than the 91 octane available just across the border.
3. When a bottle of 104+ Super octane booster was added, the octane of the
   94 octane Chevron gas dumped up to 94.8 octane and when the normal
   104+ octane booster was used, it jumped up 0.4 octane.
4. If your car is on the verge of detonation, but not yet there, octane
   booster will slow the burn and allow your car to make more power safer,
   but if it's even a little outside of that window, it will make no 
   difference besides making your wallet lighter.
5. A mixture of 100 octane race gas and 94 octane pump gas in a 50/50
   mixture yeilded excellent results of almost 98-100 octane.  The race
   fuel was always slightly higher than it's rating.
6. When the motor was disassembled to see the effects of different fuels,
   the octane booster was noted as leaving red deposits on the valves.
   Almost every brand tested did this, it must be a common additive or
   something.
7. 94 octane race gas detonated even later than the pump 94 octane because
   there are less cleaning additives in race gas.
8. Adding more than one bottle of octane booster was not tested unfortunately.
9. When the manufacturers of the octane boost were contacted, their reaction
   was that the results we got were normal.  If you read the wording
   carefully, it says "Super 104+ will increase your octane by 4-8 points".
   Well, look at the numbers above, 0.4 - 0.8 or 4-8 points.  Tricky,
   but truthful, and I don't think anyone really expected to pick up 4-8
   octane levels from a tiny bottle anyway.

In summary, get some good race gas, I use 20 litres of unleaded 114 mixed
with 60 litres of 94 octane Chevron for track events and don't forsee any
problems.  This works out to an effective octane of about 99-100.  The
car does not feel any more powerful which means that the timing is likely
not being backed down with pump gas, but if you are going 10/10ths for
a 20 minute session and things start to heat up (or the ambient temps
are above 30C), the race gas will allow the car to run nice and cool
without any detonation.  And, if you have a dial-a-boost, you can safely
crank a few pounds out of it once in a while when you need to pass a
pesky car (I don't do this, I leave it set at 1 bar, too temping having
a knob in the car).

Another thing I have to mention about EVC units is the temptatinon to
crank the boost.  I once came up on a race in the street (those days
are over) with a guy I knew.  It was a heavily done out supercharged
Mustang.  I knew he had run low 12's at 114mph in the 1/4, but I also
knew that if I do an AWD launch from hell, he wouldn't be able to catch
me till it's too late, but just to be sure, I click the manual button
on the EVC, richened the fuel mixture with the VPC and dialed in 28psi
of boost, that's 2.9bar absolute for you gauge guys :)  I used to
run 20psi all the time on that car.  Needless to say, I kicked his
butt.  I always wondered what my 1/4 mile would have been for that run
since I did my 12.7 with only 22psi.

No need to worry.  I use a A/F mixture gauge made by K&N.  They are
expensive, but an indespensible tool for tuning.  Note, I said tuning,
nothing is more irritating than a bouncing LED on your dash that moves
with your throttle position.  If you've never seen an O2 sensor readout,
it bounces around during part throttle and idle, only at WOT does it
read constant.  A slow reacting O2 sensor is one that is going bad.

A much better tool for day to day driving is an EGT, exhaust temp
guage.  These units will tell you how rich or lean you are running
and will spell out any disaster to come at the track.

For future comparison sake, max power with safety in a turbo car usually
comes in when mixture is at 13:1.  If you want ultimate power, 13.5:1
is usually the highest you will get.  Any higher and the engine will
detonate.  Note, this is different than NA cars which I believe max
out at stochi which I think is 14.7:1 or something like that.  I've
never owned a NA car so have no experience there.

The ideal exhaust temp is around 1350-1400F near the pipe leading
to the turbo, any higher and you are running lean, any lower and
you are running rich.  EGT temps are HIGHLY dependant on where the
probe is mounted.

Hope that helps,
