    Subject: I want to buy a nice 924.....

G'day,

 I'm looking for a nice 924(RHD), I've done a little bit 
of research...but does anyone have any suggestions?

I've found out that the Audi 5-speed is better than P's own
unit. The max speed I was quoted for a 1980 924 was 121mph?
Is this true? Are there any performance mods available for
the 924(e.g. cold airbox, K&N Filter, increasing compression ratio,
etc...),
 I would like to get 140mph out of her, but is that 
pushing her to hand grenade status? I don't want to add a turbo to her for 
insurance reasons, I'm 19....

Is it possible to fit 17" Porsche Cup alloys to a 924?

My budget is around about $18,000NZ (about $11,000US)

I basically want a good early eighties 924(silver), 17" 
Porsche Cup alloys, Pirelli P-Zero tires, Momo race seats,
Momo steering wheel, Momo gear shifter, radar jammer, plus 
some performance mods that I don't know will work or not.
Thats why I need help...please e-mail me!!! 

Thanks heaps,
Alister McCallum
