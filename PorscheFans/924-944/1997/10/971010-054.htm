Dear P-Fans

     I think this might make an interesting article for Excellence. What do
you guys think? Does anyone on the list have any information on early 951
prototypes? How many were (12 so far as I know) made? What happened to them?
Options? 


     My Friend, Tom Stewart, owns a 1986 951, we believe it to be a surviving
Weissach Prototype.  Vin #WPOAA0952GN150012. The car is a 1986 944 Turbo and
but has a production date of 10/84 ! The VIN plate on the A-pillar also has
an extra small plate with just the last six of the VIN. The car is a 944
Turbo but has lots of little special things that make it stand out as a
prototype. The car has Koni Sport shocks, but has the latter coil over setup
from a "S" model, it has a magnesium intake manifold and oil pan, the
throttle body seems a bit larger than any other 951 we have compared
measurements to ( including "S" models), a leather dashboard, sport seats
left & right, no third brake light, "dp" side skirts (added after it left the
factory), the DME & KLR boxes use the latter Turbo S models larger E-PROM (32
pin I think?), Most curiously the body is a Series One body with out the
flush mounted rain gutters! The steering wheel is a standard four spoke
leather wheel but has a gold Porsche Crest in the horn pad, I've only seen
this on "Special" - Porche's; ei Cup Cars & race cars, Special Wishes, and
Weissach R&D cars. The car has three piece BBS (8.5"X16 & 9.5X16's) wheels
with gold centers - some people told me that these BBS wheels were on a
limited edition '86 951 -some say that 50 were built - but I have not found
anything in print, (some say club sport option?).  Most curious is that the
original Vin # on the fire wall has been "XXXXXX" out by the factory (?)  and
a second VIN# has been added/stamped into the firewall. I believe that the
car was originally a series-one car - A Normal "944" (MY'84 ?) that was run
through the prototype assembly line to become a mule car for R&D!  The first
seven services were performed by "Weissach R&D", stamped in the maintence
book! I know that this car started out life as a "euro car" no side marker
light, right side mirror or third brake light. The US safety lights were
latter added at some time. 
      I Talked to Al Collins @ AutoThority about this car, and here is what
he told me:   The car was one of a dozen prototypes built, only two escaped
the crusher! This car was sold in Frankfurt as a used car, bought by a lady
who worked for the French government, she used the car there for a few years,
then got transferred to the USA. She had the car converted to USA Dot Specs,
right side mirror, side marker lights, US headlights, ect.. When she took up
her post here in the Washington DC area, she took her car to AutoThority for
service while she owned it. In 1989 My friend Tom bought the car -realizing
what he had!   Question is: What happened to the other eleven prototypes?
 Where can I get any information on this story?  
	The only modifications have been AutoThority Cup Chips (stage III, 285 Hp),
a test pipe, and "R" Yokohama tires. Tom used to race professional motor
cycles and I've seen him drive this car at Summit Point ( a 2 mile track) in
West Virginia, it turned 1:28 lap times with two people aboard! By the way
Tom owns a Porsche repair shop in Purcellvile, Va near Leesburg. We are both
Summit Point Instructors at FATT ("Friday At The Track" events, you can drive
your car @145 MPH all day long for $135 fee) for Bill Scott Racing who own &
operates the track.

	Please e-mail me directly with any information, Thanks - David Jalali
