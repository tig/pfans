Michael,

I am not sure if my experiences are relevent or not. I have a '86 944T
which has alloy wishbones. Here in the UK the price of new ones is truly
astronomic and the re-furbished ones are about half the price.
The fact of the matter is that the ball joint parts look identical to
that used by a Golf (Rabbit) and the Golf unit can be had for just a bit
more than 1/100 of the price of a new Porsche wishbone. I bought a
re-furbished unit (actually I had my own fixed as my model is a bit
rare) which has proved to be OK so far.
Several suppliers and garages tried to warn me off re-furbished parts
but I was suspicious of their motives. The club (PCGB) didn't even
answer my fax so no help there.
Looking at the job it appears that if there is just slack then the
spring or pressure pad has broken. It certainly looks as if replacement
of the spring, pad and ball would be very straightforward and the action
should not damage the wishbone unless performed by gorillas. If my other
ball joint fails I intend to try and change it myself.
Changing the inner bushes looks a bit more brutal.
If you have any contrary answers/experiences I would be interested to
hear.
Having your own back is great because if you scribe around the mountings
before removal you don't have to have the suspension re-aligned after
replacement of just the ball joint innards.

Regards,

Clive
