I have a 1987 944 with auto transmission, and have an elusive oil leak. It is
at the front of the engine,somewhere around the cam box/timing case joint.
The annoying thing is that the leak drips (or travels to) the front of the
exhaust manifold, thus I get smoke coming from under the hood when I stop at
a light! (embarrassing!). The smoke seems to be coming up from the rear of
the oil filter but with all the mirrors and contortions I could muster, I
cannot find the source. I have cleaned as much of the cam box / crankcase
joint that I can access ( with an auto trans, there are some badly placed oil
cooling pipes which get in the way!) and put on gastket cement, and I have
tightened down the cam box. 
The dealer says he will replace all the gaskets but cannot assure me that the
problem will be gone after spending $300.
Any help or ideas would be geatly appreciated. Please reply to
CMHinds@aol.com

Thanks,
