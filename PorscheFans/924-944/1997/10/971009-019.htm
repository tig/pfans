OK, I have this sick feeling that I know what the answer to all of this is
going to be, but I don't know enough to be sure.  So here goes.  ('79 924)

I recently rebuilt my engine (about 1300 miles ago, so I'm barely out of
the break-in time).  Unfortunately, due to circumstances the break-in
period was spent almost entirely on the interstate.  I varied my speed and
kept it well within limits (3500 for first 300, 4500 for second 300, and
actually below 5000 for last 400).  The car was performing well (there's
some fuel problems that are unrelated, but not very serious yet) and I was
happy.  Best of all, it was burning *no* oil.  I've heard that oil-burning
is normal during the break-in period, but the oil level stayed at exactly
the same point.

However, at about 800 miles, I noticed a slight burnt smell in the back of
the car.  Since I'd recently bled the coolant (bled it all over the
engine, too) and it was raining, I figured the hot engine was just burning
up the formerly-dried coolant on the camshaft cover and didn't worry about
it.  At about 1000 miles (odometer is broken), I noticed that I had lost a
significant amount of oil.  Also, there was definitely a burnt oil smell
coming from the engine and something in the back of the car.  But I
drained the oil, tightened down the head again, and filled her up again.

About 150 miles later, I'd burned through (I don't think it's leaking)
almost half a quart.  This is significantly worse than before the rebuild.

Since I had the head machined for the rebuild process, I can see two
possibilities.  First, the head cracked at about 900 miles.  Second, I
blew the head gasket (though I don't see how).  Third, the block needs
machining.

The head had been cracked before, but it was welded.  I was told that
aluminum welds don't always take, but my understanding is that they
usually go pretty soon if they're going to.  Also, I only took the car up
to 5000 rpm once, and 4000 a few times.  Plus, the crack went to water,
not oil, and I don't smell coolant burning.  And there isn't any oil in
the coolant reservoir or vice-versa.

I fumbled around with the head gasket a little when reinstalling it and
might have scraped/damaged it.  However, why is it showing up now?

Lastly, the block looked pretty good.  I couldn't do much of an
inspection, but the rust (cast iron) was basically on the outside and
wasn't bad at all.  The cylinders seemed good (no scrapes/holes).  Anyway,
since I didn't play with those, it doesn't explain why they'd go now. 
Also, I have it from a reliable source that there was no blue smoke coming
out of the exhaust (and there probably would be if I were burning oil this
fast).  The car is staying cool like never before (it went into the red if
I let it idle for five minutes, now it stays between the first and second
marks).  And I drove the car today (hot day) and not only was the
temperature good, but I couldn't smell burned oil and the car didn't leak
any.

What gives?

Thanks, and sorry for this very long message.
