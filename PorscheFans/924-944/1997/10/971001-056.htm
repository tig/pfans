It seems like it is one thing after another!  Now that the Turbo is working 
and there is a new steering rack installed, my right side strut tower seems 
to be moaning when I brake or turn.  It does not do it all the time but the 
noise is becoming more frequent.  I noticed it first after the dealer did 
my alignment but when I took it back to them the car would not comply. 
 They put it on the rack and checked everything but said everything looked 
good.  the noise subsided until this week and is definitely getting worse. 
 Is this a sign of the dreaded A-Arm failure or should I grease 
something???  The power steering rack was done about 3 weeks ago and I did 
not lubricate the sway bar bushings when I reinstalled them (I have never 
heard of lubricating them until this forum).  The ball joints seemed to be 
in good shape so I don't think that is it.  Any ideas????

Thanks!
