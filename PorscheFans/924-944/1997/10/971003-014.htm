<<  They said that the fuel lines on the 944
 turbo were designed wrong and that I needed to have them reroute it.  Well
 I instantly knew this was BS and they were trying to screw me.   >>
Not necessarily true. There was a factory recall on 86 Turbos to replace a
defective fuel rail. When teching cars for track events we found quite a few
with leaks. Check with a dealer to make sure that your system has been
upgraded.
