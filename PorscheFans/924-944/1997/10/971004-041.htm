I've just got my own headlight woes now... After turning off the lights
the last time, my headlights would not go down. I investigated, and found
that the motor still works, and will open or close the headlight if it's
disconnected, the linkage advanced a bit manually, and then the motor
plugged back in.

I found that the reason they stopped working is that one of the headlights
was binding on the body (out of alignment, already a known problem).
Well, things eventually got far enough out of alignment that, instead of
sticking momentarily on the way down, something appears to have
shorted out or failed in the control circuit. As stated previously, the
motor and it's power circuit all work. I did lose one fuse (burnt out) under
the dash, as well as the light bub in the main light switch on the dash, all
at the same time this failure happened. At failure time, the dash lights
would not go off. After replacing the aforementioned fush and bub, they
went off, but the headlamps will still not close properly.

Can anyone suggest where to look for the failed component? I'm fresh
out of ideas at the moment...

TIA
