I'm posting this for a friend with an '86 951.  Here's his description of
what's happening with the car:

     I had trouble starting it the first 
     time. The first time I tried to crank it, the starter did not engage 
     (I think), because there was no sound from the starter ??!! The next 
     time I tried it, the starter engaged, but the electrical current was 
     too low to get it started. Instead of messing with it right then, I 
     just charged it for 4 hours, after which it started OK. When I drove 
     it this time, I watched VERY CAREFULLY what was reading on the ampere 
     gauge. Usually, the engine alternator charge to the battery is 
     "higher" (I might expect to see 14 volts ++) than normal right after 
     the battery has run down, because the charger rarely fully restores 
     the battery charge as well as the car. I did not see this in the car 
     even though I drove for over 30 minutes.
     
     This is what I noticed: the ampere gauge has a line at 12 volts, 14 
     volts, and 16 volts. The spacing between the 12-to-14, and the 
     14-to-16 is approximately 1/4 inch for each section of the gauge; the 
     needle rose to 12.2 volts and never fluctuated off that the whole time 
     I drove the car. To me, this is wrong. Usually, the ampere gauge
follows        the RPMs to a limited extent; idle might be 10-to-12 volts,
2000 RPM might      be 13 volts, and 4000 RPM and above might be 14 volts +;
even when I revved      the engine at rest, or in gear, the ampere gauge
needle never budged.
     
     I really wonder if the engine alternator is functioning correctly.

So, anyone have any ideas or experienced similar problems?  Feel free to
reply privately or to the list.  Thanks!
