I checked under my hood the other day to investigate a rather unusual
sound.  Turns out it was the alternator.  Looking more closely, I saw that
the sound was actually being produced by the alternator pulley rubbing
against some other component down there (can't picture it right now,
sorry).  The bracket holding the alternator in place (the top one) had
apparently deformed slightly when someone overtightened the belts and is
now making the alternator lean "in" (to the right, facing the front of the
engine).  Needless to say, the belt isn't on straight, either.

Although I'm not getting an optimal pull from the alternator, I'm getting
enough.  (With everything on, it sits on 12 volts.)  How concerned about
this should I be?  More importantly, how can I fix it (preferably without
having to redo all the damn belts)?  Could it be the belt is just on too
tight?  Haynes is *not* very specific when it comes to 924 belt
tensioning.

Thanks.
