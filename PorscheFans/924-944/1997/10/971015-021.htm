I drove 2k miles earlier this summer, from WA to CO in my NA 944. At
times in ID, WY, Montana and Nevada regular unleaded (86 RON) was all
that was available, and that with alcohol. My 944 has always been on a
diet of 89 octane or higher for the last 13 years, so I was apprehensive
about the gas. However I heard no knocking, oil burning or any other
problems all through the mid-west.

Here in Colorado the best gas is 89 (compared to the 91 and 92 octane
"premium" in WA) octane, and in the four months I have been here I have
not heard a trace of pinging. Oil consumption is zero. I do notice a
difference in power (less) but I think that has to do with the 5k ft
elevation here in Denver, after living at almost sea-level in WA.

My 944 is an '84, without the knock-sensor, so if the gas was bad enough
to cause explosion I would hear it because ignition is not retarded. If
you are driving an '84 you need to check the timing, and check DME
default settings for the timing. As far as I know the DME switch is the
only way to change timing on a pre-85.5 (and only by +/-3deg max),
assuming your belts are good. If you are driving an 85.5 or later you
should check the knock sensor and make sure it is retarding and
advancing as it is supposed to.

I had similar problems as a previous writer was having trouble with
apparent octane related fuel.  It was not the octane but the fuel
make-up.  It was the alcohol content added in these states.  The tanks
are so marked but it`s kind of like finding the tread wear factor on
tires, you know it`s there but you have to really hunt for it.

When I got to Colorado, I had an experience with the 1979 924.  The No.
1 plug fouled at low speeds with fuel.  I adjusted the valves and remade
the ends of the sparkplug wires. The problem seemed to go away for about
100 highway miles but returned when the car was at low speeds.
