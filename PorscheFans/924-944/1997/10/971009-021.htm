=================Reply Separator====================

Thanks for the compliment, Dennis.  There were some others on the list who
also contributed information, so let's not forget them, too.
We all appreciate the info you have been able to supply - it helps to
confirm the quantity of '88 Turbo S models manufactured.
As far as answering some of your questions, I'll try my best:

	I don't have the color codes for the '88 models, only some of the
more recent ones.
	R36 - Can't find that in my options list.  There is M36 Bumpers
with impact absorbers, but that is probably just for Euro cars.
	M600 - Not on my list - however my car came with M650 Removable
sunroof w/elect tilt.
	The other option numbers are just that - options, not included in
the basic vehicle MSRP.  Of course, the M758 Turbo S package already had
some options included in it.

	As far as the insurance claim on my car, we are still
"negotiating".  I have looked at a couple of cars recently (but not
necessarily another Limited Edition), but haven't come to any definitive
decision yet.  At the least, it will be something in either a Turbo S
(247hp) or possibly an S2 (which, even though it is a lower hp vehicle,
would be fine with me for autocrossing and rallyeing and vacations).  I
don't intend on racing whatever I get, so I don't need to get the most hp -
I would rather have a lower mileage, newer vehicle for reliability.  I do
participate in DE events, mostly as an instructor, but am not that
concerned about pushing the car to its limits.  I know already that the
car's limits exceed my own - doesn't bother me a bit.  I'm just out to have
fun.
