Hey fans!

The blonde again.  Although today the weather here is absolutely
exquisite for take the top off driving, tomorrow the snow will fly. 
Soooo, I'm shopping for snow tires for Baby.  This is my first non-four
wheel drive winter in... well in 17 years!  I'm a little nervous and
hope I can get some friendlies to advise me about winter driving 944's
and possibly suggest the right snows for Baby a 1983 944.  I won't say
what I have looked at already, I want to hear from the voices of
experience, those of you who drive your cars year round in real winter
wonderlands like mine. I would also like to know if rear snows are the
way to go or if I should be considering snows all around.

Here is where the blonde stuff comes in. I went to shop for spark plugs
since I have replaced my ignition wires last week.  Why would I choose
plats over copper?  And what abour Split Fires, they are considerably
more money than the others?  Since increased performance is what I'm
looking for, can you help me out?

Thanks.  I'm blond, you understand.
