I have a problem that I hope one of you out there can help me with.  A friend
of mine has qualified for the National Run Offs that is to be carried live on
SpeedVision on the 12th.  We are in the process of getting him larger
sponsorship for next year and several potential sponsors would like to view
coverage of the series.  My problem is that SpeedVision is not offered on my
cable system.

If anyone has SpeedVision and would be kind enough to record the open wheel
races on the 12th, or even just start the tape and let it run for 6 hours,
please e-mail me directly.  I will gladly pay for the cost of the tape and
whatever the mailing costs are.  Thanks.
