Hi All;

Recently Khal asked regarding how to drive a 951:

>But is that because I have yet to learn how to drive the 951, or do others
besides Dan and I think >this is the case?
and
>I am still worried on what to do with the sudden boost as I take the sharp
curves. Any comments from >those who actually know how to drive the 951?
Practice, practice, practice??

I am by no means an expert driver, but I will give you my opinion on how to
drive a 951.  I have owned my '89 951 for over three years now.  The day
after I got the car I entered my first autocross and performed terribly.  I
had no idea what I was doing or how to drive the car.  It took me at least
a year to figure the thing out.  Now when I autocross I am consistently in
the top 3 of my PCA class which includes 944S2s and 968s.  I am still
learning something new everyime I go to the track.

Driving the 951 takes getting used to.  With virtually no torque to speak
of below 1500 RPM, you have to keep the revs up to get going.  At first I
would almost stall the car when starting from a standstill.  It would shake
and shutter as I took off.  I though here was something wrong with the car.
 Finally I realized you just had to give it more gas to get going.

Once going, I quickly learned when driving around town to stay one gear
lower than I was used to with other cars.  This car loves to run between
3500-4500 RPM.  If you look at the torque curve in the owners manual you
will understand why.  See that sharp peak?  That's where the fun starts.
Look at the horsepower curve also.  That's what keeps you going.

The car can be driven quickly on the street.  The secret to reasonable fun
on the street without jeapordizing you, your car or others, is to keep the
revs up as mentioned above.  The turbo spools up predictably and you really
only have to worry about sudden boost on wet streets where the tires can
easily break away.  For corners, the old rule of in slow, out fast is
probably best.  Done correctly, you can be at full throttle (with boost
increasing to maximum)once the car is pointed at the apex.  By the way, do
not try this on the street.  You may find yourself over the curb on the
opposite side of the street.

As far as reaching the full potential of the 951, it will never be reached
on the street.  The track is the best (and safest) place to explore the
capabilities of both car and driver.  The car's limits are rarely reached
on the track by even well seasoned drivers.  After 3 years of Driver's Ed I
have reached my limits of comfort, but probably nowhere near the cars
capabilities.  I know this because there are other people in similar cars
still going faster than I am.  I am sure other more experienced drivers can
give you more information.
