>Sorry, I should have been clearer.  The TPS is the throttle position
sensor and it is held by two screws on the side of the throttle body,
opposite to the throttle cam and accelerator cable.(a black plastic thingy
with a flatish round protrusion - you can hear it click if you move the cam
to open the throttle) The connector is  a snapped-on type.

>The air sensor is attached directly to the airbox (filterbox) - a metal
waffle-iron imprinted doodad with a black plastic top which in turn has a
connector attached to it. It is easier to clean the contacts if you remove
it with the airbox bottom as a complete unit. You will have to remove the
black metal intercooler hoses in order to do this as well as the air filter
and airbox top.  The airbox is held by two side brackets and allen head
bolts with spacer washers and hose clamps at the sensor end.

>In both cases the female end of the conector is what I am refering to
(althogh they have a row of spade lugs).  The male end is difficult to
clean unless you possess a very fine file with a miniscule blade. I just do
a cursory cleaning of this (the male ends) with electric contact cleaner
(Radio shack stuff) and hope for the best.

>I cannot comment on this knowledgeably, the gauge can only,
display/indicate the boost produced by the engine.  The DME will in all
cases (IMO) restrict/retard boost if it lacks a signal from a sensor or
detects a vacuum leak in order to protect the engine.  A symptom of a
vacuum leak is a leaner running engine - lots of heat in the engine
compartment.  This has been the case for both my car and a couple of other
friend's cars.  The temp gauge does not however reflect anything untoward
in my experience. Just one more data point.
