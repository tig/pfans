How does the ign. lock & switch come off? 

Larry,
    It has been a while since I have replaced a ignition switch but if I
remember right it goes something like this.  You are half way there by
removing the steering wheel etc.  Now look under the collum and you will
see a hole towards the floor end of the plastic housing.  Inside the hole
you should find a allen screw ( sorry forgot what size.)  Remove the screw
and the lock housing will pull out.  As for the plastic collor that should
just pull off but if it will not heating it with a hair dryer my loosen it.
 If all else fails split it and then replace it.  Once the lock housing is
out there should be a hole in the housing so you can push a catch on the
switch mech. to remove it.  Not all housings have the hole.  I would then
take it to a good locksmith to have the switch removed.  I would replace
both the electrical and mechanical part of the ignition switch while you
have everything apart.  You can get a locksmith to key all your locks
alike.
