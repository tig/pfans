Fred,

I don’t think this response is very timely, but just in case you haven’t made 
a decision on tires yet I though I’d share my thoughts and experience with 
you. You have a must unusual problem... good rears and worn fronts? I go 
through two sets of rears to every one set of fronts.

Here are my recommendations...

Subject: new front tires for 951

Hi Everybody,

It's time for new front tires on my 86 951.  I have 205 55 16 on now and
225 50 16 in back (all 4 are Bridgestone RE71, but the rears look new).

Questions: Do you really need to stick with the same tires front and
rear? Don't people adjust front and rear tire pressures independently
to get different traction anyway?  Has anyone felt the handling go bad
with different tires?

YES. Mixing different brands front to rear is definitely asking for trouble. I 
tried it once and the car was most uncontrollable.

If I can mix, I'll consider S-02, pilot SX, Conti CZ91,...  Any
suggestions?

I have S-02’s on my 951S and Pilot SX on my Volvo 850 Turbo - I much prefer 
the Bridgestones. They provide exceptional dry performance and the most 
amazing wet performance you could ever imagine. One big plus is they also RIDE 
very, very smooth. I know. We performance guys are more concerned about going 
fast. But, with our roads and my suspension I really appreciate this 
improvement. The downside, they’re not cheap. But you probably already know 
that. However, the price for a set of 4 - 215/45-17 & 255/40-17 just dropped 
this month about $200. I just paid TireRack $960 for them rather than the old 
price of $1180. I’ve recently heard I should have bought 245/45-17 for the 
front. Has anyone else run fronts and rears so closely sized yet?

If you would like to see an evaluation of these tires, checkout the following 
web page:

http://www.tirerack.com/

Their recent test gave the S-02 an overall rating of 9.2, the Pilot SX a 9.3 
and the P-Zero a 9.0. If you look it up thought you can see the complete 
breakdown by performance criteria as well as their overviews of these and all 
other tires.

I heard the autoXers use 225 50s on the front too.  Which size would
y'all get for spirited street use?

If your wheels are stock you do have room for one to two sizes larger but I 
don’t think they will offer a noticeable advantage.  I would let size 
availability of your preferred tire help you determine the answer here.

If you are looking for something decent and CHEAP, I’ve used Dunlop D40 M2’s 
for years and they get the fundamentals done just fine. It was only $560 for 
the above sizes.

If you are going to Auto-X make sure you check your local rules before 
shelling out the big bucks. And if you want to seriously compete or maybe just 
have more fun and have your street rubber last longer, consider a separate set 
for events. This opens the door to all sorts of absolutely incredible rubber 
like BFG R1’s and Hoosiers.
