Matt, I have owned my 87 951 since new. I bought an extended warranty with
it, 6 years or 72,000 miles, and it paid me back many times over. If you
look at the FAQ's and see the list of problems 944's typically have, I
believe mine has suffered all of them. It now has 110,000 miles on it.

The strange thing is that I started taking the car to the track when it had
about 80,000 miles on it and it has been more reliable since then than
before. Go figure.

Mike
