Had a strange problem yesterday. Got off the freeway after blasting by a
couple of orange cones(minivans) and when I pulled to the stoplight, the
car started running really rough and seemed about to die. I gave it some
gas and it was smoother, so my first thought about the balance shaft belts
went away. after a couple more lights, it seemed to smooth out and the
problem went away after a few minutes. My mechanic has no real suggestions
except to start testing things. I wrote earlier about a problem where I got
intermitent throttle surges while decelerating and the rpm's taking a long
while to fall back to idle in neutral. This only happens if the car is
restarted after being fully warmed.
Any help would be appreciated as this kept me from my autox this weekend.
