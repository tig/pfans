Hi Phans

I was poking around under the car the other day and found that the A/C
compressor to condensor hose has swelled at one end to the shape of a small
balloon.  A few questions:

As this hose is going to be defunct very shortly, are there likely to be
other A/C hoses to follow suit before too long as well, or is this hose
"high pressure" and fails well before the others?  Anyone had any experience
with A/C hoses failing?

Could it be the result of over-gassing?  The system was re-gassed only
around 6 months ago.  Before then it didn't work at all due to insufficient gas.

The Porsche hose seems to be around $US150.  Are there other sources for the
same hose, or can one be readily fashioned by any half-decent A/C shop?

While I'm here, is the under-body "splash tray" on the Turbo of any real use
apart from improving the car's aerodynamics?  I'm sure it would be useful
when zipping up and down autobahns at 250km/h, but I'm less sure it's useful
when motoring around town at somewhat slower speeds.  I'm thinking of
leaving it off, given that it probably adds about $50 in labour everytime a
mechanic has to R&R it.  Any thoughts, anyone?
