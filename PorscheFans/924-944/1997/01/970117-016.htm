Doing the pump is at least a six hour job.  The pump
itself will be somewhere around $200 (including the
update kit).  The seals will add a little more time and a
little more parts money.  I would say the price is quite
fair and that the shop is doing what needs to be done.

 Does anyone

Consider having the oil cooler O-rings replaced.   They are 
entering the window where they will begin to leak and such
leaks lead to other problems.  It would add a couple of hours 
to the job, but should be a bit less than if the job were done
by itself.

Welcome to 944 ownership.
