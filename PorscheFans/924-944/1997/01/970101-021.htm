All of this is perfectly plausible.  It does, however, illustrate one of the
most difficult parts of running a shop, convincing some customers that shit
happens.  This is a seven year old car, and while some things will never
break, others will.  Checking the AC compressor mounting bolts would not be
done during a belt change, and looseness might well be overlooked because
you really don't deal with the compressor when doing the belt, you just pass
it around the pulley, and you barely see the compressor itself. If it
tensions properly you button it up and go on to something else.

I have been "accused" of a rather broad range of things by customers who
seem to think that EVERYTHING has to be somebody's fault.  MY side of that
reflex is to wish their cars were parked where they will never get sun damage.  

The ONLY way around this impasse is for both parties to have enough
integrity to get through the day.  That part of the equation, unfortunatly
is what brings dispair to those owners who have bad experiences with shops,
and to those shop owners who have bad experiences with customers.

Todd, in your case, they found the problem and fixed it (apparently).  If
you trusted them before, trust them now.  The only case you make is that it
was running fine until it broke.
