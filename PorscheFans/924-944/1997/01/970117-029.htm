Just got back from L'Islet sur Mer, near QC and got -45 C close to the "fleuve"
And I... Love it.. Skydoo helps a lot and a lot of "bleus & blacks "

I'll probably get a "minoune" but a set of Khomos or Happerlikas might help 
during the winter. Don't get me wrong but those jack-stands are looking to 
be a pretty good idea as well ;)

Hehehe .. talk about a nice idea there, despite the fact that a trip from 
Victoriaville to Val d'Or took, in the summer 5H30, my buddies are asking me
to check the racing side as well. The 924S are highly regarded as good autocross
cars. And might a be also a great chance to test the skills on "le Circuit" :))
