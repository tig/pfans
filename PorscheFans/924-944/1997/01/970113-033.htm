*****
I'm 6' 3".  This is a common problem on 924s and early 944s.  When I first
looked at some early 944s, I found I couldn't even drive them comfortably.
The sales person told me to take the "spacers" out from under the seats,
but then another shop said this would change the "angles" of the seat belts
and create a hazard.  If you need to stay with the early cars, another
option would be to buy an aftermarket steering wheel that's offset from the
center hub.  The steering wheel clearance on newer 944s (85 1/2 on) is much
improved and the car is extremely comfortable to drive, so you shouldn't
run into this problem.
