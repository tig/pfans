There should be qualification to a previous post where it was stated that given the 
same driver, a 968 would be faster than a 951.  For the 86-88 (Non Turbo S), that 
statement is generally true, although not for the apparent reason of the hp difference 
 217 in the 951 and 236 in the 968.  The reasoning is the suspension, 968 suspension 
(without the M030 option) is stiffer than the 86-88 951s.  A 968 with the M030 will be 
quite a bit faster than an 86-88 951.  A 88 TurboS or an 89 Turbo will be quite 
a bit faster than a 968 even with the M030.  The Turbo S and the 89 Turbo have 247 hp, 
928 S4 brakes and a suspension system that the M030 option is based on.
