Hi All,

My $.02 on the 944 vs the world. By way of introduction I live in the Boston MA 
area and own a 1988 944TS with about 39k on the clock. I got the car last summer 
in Michigan. I use the car for track events and some summer time street driving 
and it has the Autothority chips - in fact it had some chips made in 1989 which 
I updated when I got the car.

Prior to this I owned a 1992 300ZX Twin Turbo and prior to that I owned a 1991 
MR2 Turbo. These cars were used as track cars as well as street cars.

The MR2 Turbo was a pretty slick package - 200HP 2.0 L good engine/tranny 
package. Really Really bad suspension. The early suspensions - until '93/94 had 
a bad problem with trailing throttle oversteer due to toe change under load in 
the rear suspension. The car was scarier to drive at the limits than the early 
911's. around 50k miles I started having problems and Toyota basically told me 
to take a hike. I then sold the car and got the Nissan.

The 300 ZXTT was also a pretty nice looking package BUT I blew 1 engine and 2 
tranny's as well as a lot of small stuff. The engine had an oil starvation 
problem that made itself apperent while I was chasing down a 930 at NHIS and the 
tranny could barily handle the 300 hp from the engine. So I decided that I 
needed a street car that could handle the track - to some extent. After a lot of 
research ( I have been doing track events for >15 years) I decided on 3 cars:
	1) the 944 TS - great engine, suspensions and breaks
	2) The 88/89 BMW M3 - good package
	3) early 90's vette - good engine, brakes, ok-good suspension
	
I settled on the 944 because it is faster than the M3, and as fast or faster 
than the vette and I like the german engineering ( except the clutch and a few 
other small details :-) )

The bottom line is that the Japenese cars are made to be street cars - they have 
very little margine of error with respect to reliability built in - They are 
fast but can't handle the abuse like the german cars can - The brakes are 
usually underrated for the HP, and the tranny's are not up to the HP the engines 
produce.

BTW this is only my opinion :-). But by the same token I think the Japanese cars 
are great street cars and actually own one and recomend them!!
