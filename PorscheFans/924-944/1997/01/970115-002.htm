Antony, you mentioned you would like 3-point belts for the rear of your 944 to
use the Porsche child seat.  Are you sure you really need them?  I bought the
Porsche seat when we were in Germany a couple of years ago, and the factory
folks told me lap belts only would be fine.  It wasn't until I got home and
read the instructions that I saw 3-point belts were recommended.

It seemed to me that the shoulder portion of the belt would be so far from the
child that it wouldn't do much good.  I was perfectly comfortable putting my 4
year old son in the back of my SC with the non-inertia lap belts I have.  The
Porsche seat looked like it offered better support than most US-made booster
seats that typically do not have shoulder restraints.  Course, if I remember,
your daughter is only about a year old, and being so small she might not stay
in the seat as well as my son would if there was an impact.

If you still want the 3-point belt, call Professionally Engineered Products in
Los Alos, California (805-528-7887).  As long as your car has the threaded
anchor for the shoulder harness attachment (maybe under the trim pieces?), they
have a bolt-in kit for about $150.

Good luck!
