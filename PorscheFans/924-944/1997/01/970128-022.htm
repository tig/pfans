Yes, but it is a bit unorthodox.  I just replaced the mount on the
passengers side on my 944S.  First I did not want to alter the cars
alignment by removing the rear mounting of the lower A arm.  The problem is
that you must gain enough clearance to get the motor mount free.  Here is
the method I used:

1) Remove the two bolts that hold the motor mount to the cast aluminum
engine stand off (two 13 mm box end wrenches will be required if they are
original motor mounts).  Remove the nut at the bottom of the motor mount,
located between the large aluminum cross member that runs from one side of
the car to the other, and the forward A arm suspension mount (a 17 mm box
end wrench will be required).

2)  Place a jack under the motor with a large (bigger the surface area, the
better) wooden block between the jack and the oil pan.  Carefully jack the
engine up about 1 inch.  Be very careful not to damage anything connected
to the engine with the lift (hood should be up!).  Go s-l-o-w!

3) remove the two bolts located on either side of the aluminum cross member
by the forward A arm mount (19 mm, 6 point socket required with a breaker
bar).  They bolt into the chassis.

4) Use a flat bar and gently pry the end of the cross member down to gain
the extra clearance to pull the old motor mount out of the aluminum cross
member.  The old one will likely be shorter than the new one.

5) Slide the replacement mount back into place.  You will likely have to
pry the cross member down further to get the new motor mount into the cross
member.

6) The new motor mount will require slightly shorter bolts (8 mm by 40 mm
grade 8.8) than the originals if the old motor mount did not have the
threaded mounting holes.  You will have to fuss with the fit a little to
get those new bolts to thread into the mount.  Raise and lower the jack
until it all line up.  Use Anti-sieze and be very careful not to cross
thread the new mount (aluminum threads I think).

7) Tighten all bolts to the torque specs and it's Miller time!

The new mounts are not hydraulic filled.

I bought my mount a Vertex for about $80.00.  Ask for the latest version,
don't be fooled!

Does anyone know the latest part number?
