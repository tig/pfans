And the plot thickens...
Thanks to Dave Cooley for telling me how to get the camshaft assembly.
Dave, the brakes are yours when I get to them.  Anyhow I took the
assembly apart to Clean it and replace the seals and gaskets which I
remember leaking a tad on my old car.  Well I Pull the pulley off and
heres where it gets bad.  It appears that after it slipped a tooth and
the infamous collisions began, It sheered the  locating key.  The keyway
in the cam is approximately twice as wide as it used to be and the
pulley keyway is not far behind it.  The key itself had already
fractured.  Now I am left with a decision.  Should I try and rekey the
existing camshaft and pulley?  Replace it with a new OEM cam and pulley.
Or go aftermarket.  I looked at the Automotion catalog for OEM cams and
nearly passed out.  You could buy 4 cams for a small chevy for what a
new stocker cost.  Any ideas?  I do not want to dismantle the motor in
my other,car as I would like to keep it complete and I am not real high
on swapping used 100,000 mile camshafts.  While I had the motor apart I
eyeballed everything pretty good and came to the summation that Porsche
did a hell of a job designing the thing and didn't leave a whole lot of
room for improvement without major surgery to it.  By this Rationale I
would assume that if their was a grind that made more power they
probably would have put it in themselves. On the other hand,  being a
Performance guy who has  been in other forms of motorsports, Primarily
Karting and Drag cars I know that a camshaft is the heart of the engine,
and that any type of engine can benefit from profile changes to better
suit the operating ranges and engine loads.  I would like to here a
consesensus so everyone please let me know what you think.
