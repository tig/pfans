>Hello to the group.  If Everyone remembers a while back I posted that I
>had just bought a 85.5 944 with very loud collision problems while the
>motor was running.  Well I took it all apart, found the cam had slipped
>1 tooth and polished the piston tops.  The slippage seems to have been
>due to an improperly tensioned belt from the previous rebuild which
>judging from lack of carbon and incredibly good shape of the cylinders
>was performed very recently.  Upon further disassembly of the head I
>found some post factory stampings looking like someone's initials and
>7-95 which I hope means July of 95. Anyway I just did the valve job and
>we are good there.  My problem (and Questions) now concerns the camshaft
>assembly.
>1. Does anyone know the size, designation for the bolt that threads into
>the front on the camshaft at the center of the sprocket.  It looks like
>a 16 point allen head.

It is a 12 point metric allen, available from Snap-on.  Sorry, don't
remember the size.

>2. Is the large nut that holds the sprocket on left or right hand
>thread?  I don't want to go Blazing away with the impact in the wrong
>direction. 

Everything is normal thread.  Use the big one for counterholding.

>3.  Can anyone give the headbolt torque for my year? (85.5) It seems for
>every aspect of this rebuild the manual (haynes) has been useless.  It
>just says see Porsche Dealership. It is a Fel-pro gasket if it matters.

Three stage:  20,50,90 Nm

>4.  Can anyone give me any reccomendations for belt tension?  I found a
>guy local who has the tool.  (thank God)  

Just make sure you know where the crank and the cam are, do the normal
alignment of marks, and use the tool.  It will take several adjustments if
the belt is new.

>
>5.  Does anyone know what it costs to have the antennae front windshield
>replaced (rough estimate)
>Thanks very much in advance for any pointers and advice you can offer.

>P.S. To all those who had Emailed me about my other parts car, thank you
>for the interest.  I am sorry I have not responded to all of you.  Later
>in the month when I get this car together and will be parking it outside
>for a bit, I will then have room in my garage to pull the other one in
>and dismantle it for parts.  If anyone is interested still, please Email
>at the END of the month.

I want first shot at the brakes/suspension.
