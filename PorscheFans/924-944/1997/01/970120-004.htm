     Hi Mike !!
     
     Welcome to the wonderful world of "which went where on my car" Porsche 
     ownership.
     
     I have two 924's, a '77 and '78. The early 924 never had an electric 
     sunroof, as far as I know. You may well indeed have some other car's 
     piece in your roof. I have a spare one if you need it, I think. [That 
     shed's kinda spooky, so I haven't been in it for a while.]
     
     You have already spent some change on this poor thing, as I read. My 
     pearl white '78 got similar treatment when I first got it. Then it got 
     used as a commuter for a year and a half in D.C. traffic. [No A/C, 
     heavy clutch, summer beltway traffic, oh goody!] Really hasn't been 
     the same since. My poor little 924's have been sadly neglected as of 
     late. That's only becaus I gotta 'nuther Porsche, an '87 951.
     
     Good luck with it, and lemme know what you find out 'bout the sunroof.
     
     Yours in the Stuttgart spirit,
     
     Russell Therrien
     '87 951, Satinschwartz Metallic, lotsa dead bugs.
