My car leaks water into the driver's side rear footwell, _only_ if the car
is parked on an incline (front pointing up).  When I open the drivers side
door, I get a splash of water onto the ground that collected in the door
jamb, which I think overflows the back of the doorjamb into the rear
passenger area.  Explain that one. That, along with my soggy rear storage
areas, makes for a fast, good looking aquarium on wheels. 

I will be checking the drains underneath the driver's door to make sure 
they are open, even the door doesn't appear to be collecting water inside.
As a desparate last move, I will crawl inside the car and have someone 
direct a garden hose at various areas to see where the water is entering.

Gregor - 89 944 2.7.  Washing away in Eugene, OR.
