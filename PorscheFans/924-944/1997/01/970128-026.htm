	Reliability is generally good but prepare yourself for the
	fact that when something does break, it's going to be expensive
	most likely. This is a so-called "super car" and it usually has
	"super car" repair bills. I'd look for an 1989 model if it were
	me. How much horsepower you want is a factor dependent on how
	much money you can throw at it. The 89 comes with around 260
	(right, guys?) but this can be significantly boosted depending
	upon how much money you can spend. I'm fairly confidant you could
	get around 350-375hp by spending 7K-10K on the motor. Don't try
	to cut corners here or you'll be sorry. What you should for is
	records, records, records. Also, look for an owner who is a 
	member of the PCA. A PCA-member owned Porsche with complete
	records is probably one of the safest buys in the used car
	market. When you do find one, make sure *your* shop goes over
	it thoroughly. If the owner balks at your shop checking it
	out, walk away. Good luck!
