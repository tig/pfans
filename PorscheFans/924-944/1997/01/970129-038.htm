I have an 87 924S and it went in the shop back in Nove 96 to be repaired
because it was smoking heavily.  I figured the oil was leaking on the
manifold and would have gone after it myself but did not have much time to
work Because I am a coolege student.  I am also without the needed tools and
facilities at school.  I just got the car back about two weeks ago, no make
it three, and was wondering if that is too much time for it to spend in the
shop.  Now I know I have given lttle detilas, but any suggestions would
help.  I just wanto know if the guys I ent it too were really careful or
just really slow.  I have not driven my baby yet, because the weather here
in Va can be nasty and rear drive sports cars tend to do bad in the snow, I
think.

Thanks much for any help.
