Hi everyone:

When I bought my 968 a few weeks ago from a P-A dealer, I was told that the
original owner had the car lowered to "Euro height."  The car does indeed
look a little bit lower than stock and handles extremely well.  I haven't
driven a 968 at the original height, however.  I also noticed that my car's
ride really is quite stiff, especially over broken Midwestern pavement.

1.  How can I tell how my car was lowered (replacement springs, heat-treated
stock springs, or some other method)?

2.  How much does lowering improve handling on the street or on the track (or
at driver's ed events)?

3.  How much does lowering the car about an inch affect the ride?

Thanks in advance!

P.S.  Don't be upset if you reply and I don't get back to you right away.  I
will be away for a few days.  How will I survive without my daily 50 pages of
Porsche trivia?
