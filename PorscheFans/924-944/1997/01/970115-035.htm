If your oil cooler seals have never been replaced, then yes, you're
probably seeing exactly that.  Just after I got my 85.5 I ran into the same
problem-- the sheer age of our cars means that most all the original rubber
pieces (now going on 12 years old) are shot, including ball joints, motor
mounts, etc.  While oil normally runs at fairly high pressure, the water in
your cooling system remains under pressure when the car is shut down-- your
oil pressure goes to zero.  As someone else suggested, though, check your
radiator cap for a goopy mess to confirm that it's the oil cooler seals.

A word of caution- do NOT reuse your original 3-piece pressure relief
valve!  Porsche introduced a retrofit for our cars which is just one piece.
It costs dearly ($215 about two years ago), but I have heard too many
horror stories when reinserting a used, three-piece valve.  One member of
this group tried it and ended up blowing out his head gasket.  In my case,
it blew out the side of the oil filter, all over the exhaust manifold.  If
the oil pressure gets out of control, you will soon learn which is the
weakest part of your engine-- could be main seals, could be a gasket.

>But can it be done with the motor in the car? My guess is yes. A visual

>exhaust manifold. That done - it can't be too bad.

Yes.  It is supposedly possible from underneath without removing the
exhaust manifold but removing it seems like it would be pretty
straightforward as well.

>Some questions:
>
>1. Do I need to drain the oil and coolant first?

Definitely-- you'll be changing both before you're through.

>2. I counted the following bits that need to be replaced:
>	1	oil cooler gasket
>	2	oil-cooler O-ring	(I'm guessing)
>	2	oil-coller seal		(I'm guessing)
>	1	rubber mount
>	1	relief valve sealing ring
>	1	relief valve O-ring
>	1	relief vavle plug gasket
>	1	oil filter boss gasket
>   Is that all? Do these come in kits from the dealer?

Porsche also released a retrofit for our cars wherein they put the Turbo's
seals in our cars.  You do NOT need a new oil cooler or cover-- there are
conversions to newer styles, but you don't need them.  Just the seal kit
will do, and it used to be about $90.  Pay someone to pressure test your
cooler while you've got it out of the car.  They usually don't need
replacing, but better to find out now.

>3. What about the oil-pressure relief valve. The leaking problem is
>fairly new -- does this REALLY need to be changed?

YES, YES, YES!  Don't skip this essential part (speaking from experience
here)!  The oil/water mix tends to make a very sticky mess which certainly
adds to the already impossible process of correctly reusing the older
three-piece relief valve.  Save yourself a lot of headache and replace it
with the updated part.  I have copies of the tech bulletins for this
particular procedure if you need more detailed info (like part numbers).
Good luck!
