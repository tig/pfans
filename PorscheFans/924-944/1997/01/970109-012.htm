>Hello all,

I would agree that you have some sort of vacuum leak.  While the engine is
running, spray carburetor cleaner around everything from the air flow meter
on back.  If you get an RPM change you have probably found the problem.
This presumes that the plugs are clean and you don't have another problem.

 I also assume that I need a new O2 sensor since it is 140K miles

Take it to an alignment shop, which is where any of these things would get
you anyway.  They are capable of diagnosing anything in the front
suspension, steering, even if they are not a Porsche shop.  Then go from there.
