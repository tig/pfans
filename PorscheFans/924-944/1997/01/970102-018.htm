Barry, congrats on removing the cv joints. I stripped 3 12 point bolts
and 4 bits when I did my clutch but they were all on the pressure plate.
Keep your drill  handy. 

The two things that were difficult for me were the speed sensors (broke
one which was stuck - the bakelite doesn't take much force) and the
speed sensor bracket - it has to be unbolted and is held on with a pin.
Also beware of the ground bolt on the top of the bell housing, its hard
to get at and almost impossible to see. If the bell housing won't come
off check under the heater valve(?) at least I think its the heater
valve.
If you haven't already,I would recommend you buy new bolts for the
pressure plate, flywheel and a new rear engine seal.
