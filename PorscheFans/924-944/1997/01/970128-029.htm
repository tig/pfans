On 1/27 there was a note about Passport 5000 lidar false alarms.  Well, don't
get me started...

I bought a Passport 4500 superwide detector through the mail from "The Escort
Store" (Cincinnati Microwave) about 3 years ago after getting a ticket.  I
had owned the original Escort from the early 80s, but it had finally died and
I hadn't replaced it until then.  My first Passport developed frequent lidar
false alarms, so I called the company.  They diagnosed a loose connection
between the power cord and the detector, and replaced the unit under
warranty.  The second one developed frequent lidar false alarms and a LED on
the front panel died (soon after shipping), so they replaced that one also.
 The third unit has been perfect.

I bought a cordless phone from the company.  The first unit had a loud hiss
which would not disappear despite changing channels, etc.  They replaced it
under warranty and the second one has been great.

Now, like a dope, I bought a Solo detector from them.  (What do they say?
 Fooled once, shame on you, fooled twice, shame on me?!)  After 3 weeks, it
developed frequent lidar falsing and then began to turn itself off without
warning every 10-15 minutes.  It had worked well before that.  I have
returned it to the company for exchange or repair, and they expect a 3-week
turnaround.  Hope I don't get a ticket before then!

I purchased the Solo, despite my past problems, because my 968 lighter socket
fits lighter plugs poorly and is powered all the time.  I could have powered
another detector off of an ignition-switched lead, but I didn't want to fool
with the electrics.  I hesitated to buy any other product except a Valentine
1, but I don't think they make a battery-powered detector.

In summary, it seems that Cincinnati Microwave's quality control is not
nearly as good as it used to be.  A real shame, since when they work the
Escort products are a pleasure to use.  As an Ohio resident (they really are
made here), I hope they improve this problem.
