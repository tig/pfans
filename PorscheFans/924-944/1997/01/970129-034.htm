Good thing!  I'm surprised it hasn't already let go.

I have the same problem with my steering rack-- I can't seem to keep fluid
in it and it's because the rack seals have aged to the point that they
leak.  You're probably in the same boat as me-- in for a new steering rack.
I would NOT run the car without power steering fluid for very long-- the
rack was intended to be lubricated and power assisted.  Also, if it's
leaking fluid out, there's a chance that dirt can get in and make the rack
more difficult to eventually rebuild (among other problems).

This is usually the characteristic sign that the mounts need to be replaced.

Try Zims Autotecnik in Texas: 800-356-2964 for the center console hinge
($20).  As for most of the interior trim pieces, you may find that the only
source is the dealer.  Actually, with their recent price reductions, some
of the parts are *almost* reasonable =:-)   As for the tool, I've seen
places selling them for like $380 which, while still a wad of cash, is much
less than the $500-$600 I've seen elsewhere.

It's a CO2 test tube into which a precision probe is placed to tune the
car.  It's normal.
