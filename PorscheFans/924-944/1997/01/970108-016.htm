"MMitchel asked about the #2 rod bearing problem, real or imagined."

To the one racer I talked to who toasted two engines, the problem was real.  It
appears to be track related on sweeping turns.  Some make sure their oil is 1/8"
over the full mark and have no problem.  Others change the rod bearings at a set
interval of track hours and have no problem.  Those who do blow up their engines
seem to fall into several categories.  There are those who are top drivers
pushing the envelope.  Those who take a hard driven street car to the track and
spin a bearing the first time out and those whom the Porsche god does not smile
upon.  It happens enough to be a concern for someone like me who is rebuilding
their engine.  From what I have learned when the bearing spins, it trashes the
entire engine.  Not a nice thought after spending half a life time pulling the
engine.

The current plan of attack  is to make a few modifications, so if I ever do
learn to push the envelope, I will not have to worry about blowing up the big
buck engine. From my research, the air/oil separator kit that Jon Milledge has
developed is the hot ticket.  We will be installing one.  A 3 quart Accusump is
also going in when we figure out the best mounting spot.  It will not fit in the
storage compartment behind the rear wheel.  The S2 pan baffle is supposed to
help.  I ordered one from George B. (good guy) but it is the same as my stock
turbo baffle.  I will get with George for more research on this.  My engine
builder has a method of machining half the bearing for better oil retention.  He
also plans to add a custom crank wiper and plug the oil return holes that dump
on the crank.

Some machine the girdle and block and also redrill the crankshaft.  Different
opinions on this, I'll pass on the info when I get some facts.

The other oil problem is that a pressure wave is created by the pistons at over
6200 rpm which blows the oil out of the pan and uncovers the oil pickup.  Cross
drilling between the lower cylinder supports should equalize the pressure and
solve this. One of the few things that is simple and inexpensive.

On a side note, my $troker is starting to show some progress.  The cylinder
liners are almost installed, one more cylinder to bore.  The head goes on my
builder's flow bench next week.  He even uses a barometer and thermometer to set
a baseline before checking the flow.  Most of this technical engineering stuff
goes over my head.  I have learned more about piston quench areas, cryogenically
stress relieved rods, multispark ignitions, valve spring harmonics, injector
flow rates, etc. than I ever wanted to know.  I just want the beast to go fast.
