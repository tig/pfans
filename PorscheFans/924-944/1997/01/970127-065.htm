You could check the knock sensor for function.   Put a timing light on the
car and
rap the block anywhere near the knock sensor.   You should see the timing retard
as much as 4 degrees.

But who knows what all that performance gear has done to things.   If I were
trying
to induce detonation (ping/knock) I would have considered many of the mods
already
done for this short-future engine.   With all the extra head pressures, it
would only
take a couple flakes of glowing carbon to set off the fuel prematurely.

You might consider suggesting aviation fuel, an octane booster,  or racing fuel
to help.   Maybe he forgot and filled it with 85 octane no lead, or the fuel
octane
was not as advertised.

Is there any question about "too much boost'?  I am sure this car IS very fast,
but the cost has been, and will continue to be, very high.

The
