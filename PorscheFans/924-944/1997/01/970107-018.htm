This is brief and non-technical, but what I have gleaned from this list:

1.  Porsche must have known about the #2 rod bearing problem because they 
modified the oil galley within the crankshaft on the 3.0 engines (968).

2.  This problem usually occurs under extremely hard cornering loads, with
low oil levels in the crankase (anything below top mark on dipstick), or
if the dreaded oil cooler seal failure has gone undetected for a long time
and you have coolant in your oil.  If the car hasn't been tracked, I
wouldn't worry about it. In an autoX or other stressful driving conditions
with high rpm, an engine can easily go through a half quart of oil in a
very short time. 

A contributor here stated that keeping the oil topped at the upper mark 
at all times would reduce the risk of #2 bearing problems.
