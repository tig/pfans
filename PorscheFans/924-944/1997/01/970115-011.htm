I think that over time it appears that some things need to be checked more (or
less?) frequently than the manual implies. The timing belt is a classic
example. My 87 944 S sevice records indicate that the belt broke at 39K (having
been replaced at 8K with an updated belt and checked 2K5 miles later) leading
to $3500 bill. Maybe the experienced owners on this list have some
recomendations that can be put together? Oil changes? The manual gives much
more that 3K between changes.

By the way, thanks for all the great advice I got for my posting in December
about buying a 944 S. The car is great and this mailing list is an incredible
asset. This list is a great example of what the WWW is good for.

And to use this posting for my own questions.
1) When I start my car, when it is really cold, it likes to rev up and down at
idle. It goes up to ~ 1500 rpm and then back down to 1000. This continues until
I press the excelerator a couple of times. Any ideas?

2) Can anybody recomend a good place to get a reconditioned control arm.
Automotion seems to offer the best deal. I am hoping to track the car later.
Does this make a difference?



Robert.
