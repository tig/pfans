I'm in the process of trying to decide which one of the above cars I
should look for. At this point, I don't have any real preferences and
am leaning towards the idea of buying the first mechanically sound, low
mileage one that shows up locally. I'm looking for a predominantly
street car (fun, but not too fast) that'll make its way to about 2-3
autocrosses and 2 track events each year. Unfortunately, my latest
encounter with the local cops and its impending effect on my insurance
premiums precludes anything with a turbo from being an option. I'm sure
this has been beat to death before, but I'd like to get some thoughts
on what would be a better choice. The older cars seem attractive due to
the lower initial cost and the lower cost of (frequent :) replacement
of the skinny 15" tires, but I'm not sure if the cost of maintenance
will offset most of the savings there. (More $$$ saved = more times/year
at the track!) I really have no experience working on cars (I even have
the dealer replace my wiper blades :(, but I'm looking to start.  So,
one of the concerns is ease of maintenance.  I'm not overly concerned
with the horsepower/torque differences (actually I'd probably be better
off -- with the cops, i.e. -- with a slower car) as long as
driveability in every day situations isn't compromised.

There's a couple of cars that somebody told me someone might have for
sale soon:  an '88 944 with 10K miles and an '88 924S with 15K miles.
Both cars are supposedly "as new" but that's all I know at this time
(could I be any more vague :). I plan to make the owners an offer if
they make up their minds to sell -- does about $9,200 and $6,500 seem
reasonable?  (Retail seems to be $10,000 and $7,000 respectively).  I
have read the buyer's guides/... and checked prices in the blue/blk
books, but I was hoping to get some feedback from here.

This is the second time in a year that I'm looking for a 944. I didn't
have much luck finding a Turbo S in Apr-May last year and ended up
buying the RX-7 TT that I'm trying to sell now. I hope to have better
luck this time since I have a longer list of models/years that I'm now
open to.

Thanks for listening...
