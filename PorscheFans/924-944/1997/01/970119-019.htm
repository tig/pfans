Neil, I have not had the opportunity as of yet to have my car towed. According
to the information I have the front of the 951 has a eye bolt nut to attach
a cable to pull the car up onto the flat bed truck. The truck bed tilts to
the back to the effect of an uphill driveway. The front should not scrape.
I am not to sure of the 944 (non-turbo). I used to have one of those,but
only needed it towed when it was killed by a hit and run driver. If you every
have to have it towed do not assume (ass out of you and me) the truck driver
knows what he (or she) is doing. Always watch and question. If they ruin
the car they will assume it was there before. I do not know where they hook-up
on 944. You may want check now where they can hook-up and drag the car up the
bed on the truck. I will look at my car which has the same front end and
let you know. 

good luck,

David
