>> Disconnecting the power for a period of time results in the need for a on
>> board computer reset to clear the airbag fault indicator.  This is a
normal
>> occurrence whenever the power is disconnected for a period of time.  It
>>will take the dealer about 15 minutes labor to fix it.  It requires reading
the
>> computer fault memory, and then resetting it.  I don't know how or even if
>>you can do it yourself.

The easiest way to keep the computers (including the radio anti-theft codes)
alive when the battery is disconnected is to go to your favorite auto parts
store and buy a little goodie that uses a 9 volt battery and plugs into the
cigarette lighter.  The 9 volts will keep all of the computers happy so there
is no need to reset any of them.  This is simply a male lighter plug on one
end and a female 9 volt battery plug on the other.  It works only if the
lighter power is direct and not routed through the ignition key.  Most are
direct, but YMV.
