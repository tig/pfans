I'm guessing the 86 944 cluster is fairly different, but my 84 944 has a
tach gauge that has a 4-prong plug + a 2 prong plug servicing the mpg
gauge and the tach. In my case the mpg works fine but the upshift
indicator (little orage arrow) and the tach work when they want to. My
speedometer also works fine, so I am fairly sure the speed sensor works.
The tach sensor is actually in the front, close to the master cylinder,
but again in my case that works fine (4 ohm across, normal temp.)

I am guessing my tach has a problem inside the individual gauge, and
unless the 86 944 has a conbination cluster that cannot be seperated, I
would take apart just the tach. I haven't done this yet but I would
probably look for the usual stuff -- continuity through the prongs, broken
solders etc.

My odometer also does not work -- my 944 has a mechanical speedometer --
so I am trying to make sense of the speedometer working fine and the
odometer dying (also a dead trip meter). Any advice?
