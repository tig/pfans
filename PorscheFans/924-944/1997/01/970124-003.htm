Hi All,

I've owned my first Porsche an '84 944 for 6 months now, and it has always
had the same problem. It hasn't really been much of a problem as such, but
its getting to the stage when I'd like to do something about fixing it.

The car will start first time easily when totally cold, eg first thing in
the morning/end of the day. But if it is even slightly warm, eg even up to a
couple of hours after being switched off, it won't start "first time". It
will crank over normally, but there is no firing. If I keep cranking it for
a while >5 secs, it does eventually start, or if I stop cranking after a
couple of seconds and then "re-crank" it starts immediately.

I imagine it could have something to do with fuel, but I'm really not too
sure where to start looking. It has 130,000 miles on it. When the car is
running it seems to run perfectly.

Another problem which I am not too sure if it is related or not, is that if
driving with the sun roof open and window(s) down, I get the distintive
smell of petrol fumes. Also if I park the car with everything shut, and then
come back a few hours, I do get the slight smell of petrol. The fumes aren't
VERY strong, but when they are there, very distinctive. I have looked at the
seals/connectors under the carpet in the rear above the fuel tank, but
nothing obvious there.

Thanks in advance.
