Two things come to mind.  First, 944/951/928 valve lifters will often hang
up after prolonged storage.  The vast majority of the time they will
eventually pressurize and quite down.  You can accelerate the process by
adding one of the top oils that have solvents that can remove the deposits
that supposedly contribute to this.  Stuck lifters clearly make a clicking
sound, rather than a deep knock.  If you had a stuck valve you would have
serious miss associated with the noise.  Second, the dreaded #2 rod bearing
demon lurks out there, and this sure sounds like it.  A deep knock, directly
related to engine speed, and nothing affects it.

An experienced mechanic should be able to hear the difference.  I would not
drive the car until you have it sorted out.  A sticky lifter is no big deal,
but a rod bearing can quickly lead to a tossed rod.
