One method is to use a dial gague (in the spark plug hole) to deternime when
the piston reaches the peak of its travel (TDC = peak needle reading) while
turning the crank by hand. Another crude method (yes, I have been desperate
enough to use this method in between heats when I raced motorcross long ago)
is to use a length of wooden dowel about 18 inches long that will fit into
the spark plug hole. With one end of the dowel resting on top of the piston
(as close to perpendicular to the top of the piston as possible), turn the
crank (by hand, PLEASE and be certain that the dowel doesn't bind and break
of in the cylinder!!!). Observe the movement of the piston by watching the
movement of the dowel. The dial is the way to go, but the dowel may let you
check the existing reference marks to determine ballpark accuracy. Remember
that the piston will reach TDC on both an exhaust and combustion stroke (if
that matters for your application).
