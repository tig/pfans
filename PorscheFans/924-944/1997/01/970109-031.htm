I'll look at that.  First a little searching is in order.  I'm used to
carbureted fuel delivery.

No, still lower at freeway speeds, not quite as low, but still low.

All good.  I replaced the thermostat, right fan and they both work fine

I was hoping for a better response (I had already anticipated that
response).  Any 924 experts know how to get my '77 to '77 1/2 specs?

Thanks for the help.
