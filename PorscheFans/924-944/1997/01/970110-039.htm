     First of all, Thank you all for sometimes quite lengthy and very 
informative responses to Porsche questions, what an incredible resource 
this has become. 

  I just had a mishap last week that has created a problem and I need 
suggestions if anyone cares to share any.  I have an '87 951 (in need of 
a new Big-haired woman) :) and I spun it around a few times on a large 
four lane road last week after a fresh snow.  It was at very low speed as 
I am generally over-cautious in bad weather, but it just "came loose" 
perhaps over some freshly hidden ice.  Anyway, as it made it to the side 
of the road on the last spin, the back hit, then the front followed and 
the front rim landed squarely parallel against the curb.  My rim was 
slightly gashed and my steering wheel crooked, so I immediately took 
it in for a four wheel alignment (and a new set of Goodyears).  The tire 
place is very reputable and they said it "took the alignment" and showed to 
be perfectly aligned afterwards on the computer (which I took 
to mean I had avoided any actual physical damage of steering related 
components).  The problem is, although I am pleased my steering wheel 
looks normal now when I'm headed straight, the car pulls terribly to the 
right.  This is a pretty significant pull and it did not do this before.  
The tire place said I should have the frame checked, but this was not a 
"major accident" and the car shows nothing of this hit (besides the rim 
scrape).  Frame damage sounds excessive and unreasonable to me, but I'm no 
expert, so I would love to hear any wisdom you guys may have to offer. 

                           Thank you, 
                                  Michael in Indy
