I guess all things are possible.  If your talking about a normally aspirated
944, it would definitely be better to sell the 944 and go buy a 944 turbo.
 There are just too many things to change, plus the 944 turbo drivetrain is
strengthened to handle the extra power.

Same as before.  The K-27 will fit on a normal 944 turbo.  There may be some
clearance issues.  The one I have is that the back of the head light scrapes
the injection boot when it goes down.  Someday this will cause problems.  (I
could cut out some of the headlight bracket, but don't want to yet)
