You should check the battery tray. It is directly above the passenger side
footwell, and the metal there has a tendency to rust, making holes water can
flow through. Stick your hand up the footwell, and see if the insulation
directly behind the glove box is wet. If it is, you probably have a hole in
the battery tray. I would check the metal even if it looks fine, since it
seems to rot from the inside instead of rusting, at least on my car.  The
metal has become soft, but it looks perfect with no rust spots.

Strange that nobody mentioned this already, though.. This problem is also
listed in the 944 FAQ, perhaps you should take a look at it.
