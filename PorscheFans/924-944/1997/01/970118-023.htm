:Subject: water pump failure
:
:I just took my 1984 944 to get a major service done yesterday
:and the mechanic found out that the water pump is leaking 
:onto my brand new belts that the owner before me
:just had put on.  The car that I bought is in really good
:shape. Just had all of the belts, rollers, motor mounts,
:front struts, and transmission just replaced. The car
:only has 81,000 miles on it for a '84.  The only thing
:that was not replaced was a water pump and now
:the car needs one before it causes some major engine 
:damage.  My mechanic says that he can save the new belts
:(only 3,000 miles on them) and readjust them to the new
:water pump, and will put in a new seal kit.  He says
:he will do this for $550 including parts and labor.
:Does that sound right? Does that sound fair? Does anyone
:have any other suggestions? This is the first time I
:had to get any work done because the owner before me 
:had a  lot of work done beofre I bought it,
:and he always had it serviced on time.  Hopefully, this will
:be the last time for awhile that I will see my mechanic.
:There does not seem that nothing else can break because
:everything else is pretty much brand new.
:
:Does anyone have any suggestions on the water pump problem
:or the price?
:
:Thanks,

I just had my timing belts, rollers, and front end seals replaced. Quote
was originally 'about $500' depending on the condition of the rollers.
Actual came to $635 with all five rollers replaced. I'd say your estimate
is about right: $110 seal kit, $300 labor for mine.

A word of caution: Test drive the car immediately and 'listen' for any
vibrations that were not there before especially above 3000 RPM. I have
to take mine back Monday so they can orient the balance shaft correctly
this time. I understand this is a very common SNAFU.

Regards, Doug.
