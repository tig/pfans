Hello All,


I usually try to fix most problems on my 951 myself, but this lifting 
roof is driving me crazy! The roof does not work all the time, it started 
out as a very intermittent problem, working 90% of the time,  now it 
seldom works at all. Here is the scoop.

- Rear latches release in first key position when switch is depressed.

- Latches will not secure roof when car is started, but seems to after a 
while.

- When roof works it operates fine (full range, no strange noises, 
alignment is correct)
  it works for a couple of times and then nothing.

- I exchanged the relay in the fuse compartment with another, no change.

- The micro-switch at the above header checks out ok.

- The center console lifting roof switch is good.

- At one point I turned the drive nut manually, and it seemed like the 
gears were working properly? (after this the roof worked fine for several 
times, thinking I was home free until I tried it again several hour 
later, and not working again.)

- Relays (2) on motor assmby. check out ok.

- fuse has continuity

- I have read through the service bulletins pertaining to roof adjustment 
and          troubleshooting and really don't know where to begin.

- I have the older style motor assmby.

- The micro switches on the motor assmby. seem fine

- 9.85  manufacture date of vehicle (for service bulletin reference) 



I was going to check the switch for proper voltage, and also the 
connector on the motor assmby. but in doing so realized that the bulletin 
#8403 was dated 11.19.84. Is this information accurate?  Should I update 
to the newer gear unit? I am at a loss here. One of my problems is that I 
do not understand in detail the function of the relays and microswitches.

Remember I have the older style motor and drive assmby.  

Any input with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
  
TIA,

Mike Kehr

   86' 951  cracked headers, dead rear wiper, a lifting roof that is 
toast, coolant that seems to evaporate in thin air, water in the rear 
brake lens, moisture in the front turn signal lenses, a center console 
cassette door that has decide not to open, unless I break it!
