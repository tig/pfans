Hi,

Before you replace the expensive switch, make sure there
are no problems with your headlight's electrical system.
If you are getting hot enough to melt the plastic, you
are drawing too much current. No sense in melting your
new switch. If you recently changed your lamps to mega
100 watt flamethrowers and didn't use the remote power
relay, that could be a problem. Or maybe a partial short?

If it turns out that the switch is just too old and
torched itself, Auto Atlanta has them for U.S. $30. They
list the P/N as 477 941 531G. They are not always the
cheapest so you may want to look around some. I just
happened to have their catalog handy.

I have an '84 as well. I upgraded to 60 watt H-4's a
year or so ago with no problems. I seem to recall hearing
that these switches were a problem way back when I had my
924 (same switch I think). Hope some of this helps.
