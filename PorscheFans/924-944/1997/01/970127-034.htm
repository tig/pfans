	It can be done... but all the places that I've talked to say that it 
costs around 2 grand. Turns out that you have to replace all the 
rubber surroundings of the hatch and then add the spoiler. Either 
that or the actual hatch is completely different. I called AIR after 
they sent me their almost 20$ photocopied so-called catalog and they 
didn't have it. So I called them... guy on the phone sounded like he 
didn't need anyone's business and was very impatient. He quoted a 
price I'd never consider spending on a spoiler... I know they may 
supply lotsa racers but the guy on the phone sure could learn some 
etiquette. As for Auto Atlanta... I've been meaning to call them but 
haven't had the time... I wouldn't be surprised if their 968 wing is 
just a replacement for a 968 only.
