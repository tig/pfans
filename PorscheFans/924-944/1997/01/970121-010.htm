     Last evening I reached over to my left and pulled out one of those 
     "other" magazines.  First, I should disclose that I do not subscribe 
     to any of those "other" magazines.  It is my girlfriend's, and I still 
     subscribe to only German purity, but nevertheless, something made me 
     do it.  It could have been space aliens.  I am sure you have heard 
     about their mind control experiments on us lowly humans. 
     
     On the cover of this "other" magazine was a bright red Corvette.  It 
     included a feature article about a brand new C5 Corvette.  So, what 
     have they done to the poor creature this time?  In days past they have 
     tweaked the looks here and there.  Added a few more creaks, George 
     Jetson dash, and more and more electronic gadgets.  You can only 
     mutilate something so far before it becomes jam. 
     
     The first page of the article read "If, as they say, God is in the 
     details, then this is the first holy Corvette".  Reading on I learned 
     that a new chief engineer, Dave Hill, was in charge of the make over.  
     This car had been made stiffer in the chassis; four times stiffer than 
     the previous Gumby mobile.  Not only that, but other amenities were 
     given the heave ho and totally reworked.  For that matter, this car 
     was a total redesign.  Yes, it is still fiberglass, but that is the 
     heart of Corvettes, and the soul must be performance at insanely cheap 
     prices (relatively speaking).  All of this accomplished with state of 
     the art technology such as fly by wire throttle (nervous?), 
     hydraulically formed steel frame members, and a chassis stiffness that 
     rivals Mercedes.  In fact, so stiff as to convince you this isn't an 
     American car.  Dave Hill used this technology to his best advantage. 
     
     Now where is all this leading, and what does this have to do with 
     Porsches?  How about drive trains?  No, the Corvette doesn't have a 
     928 VarioCam engine under the hood.  However, Dave Hill did take an 
     interesting approach to the drive line.  Up front is the engine where 
     one always expected, but the tradition ends just after the clutch.  
     There, attached to the bell housing, sprouts a healthy torque tube.  
     Torque tube?  Yes, followed by a what, a transaxle!  Well, not quite a 
     transaxle by its true sense.  This transaxle does have a separate 
     compartment where fluids for the six speed transmission and the Getrag 
     limited slip differential never meet.  Can you say P-o-r-s-c-h-e?  I 
     knew you could. 
     
     So, what does this do?  How about a weight distribution of 51.4 to 
     48.6?  How about real analog dash gauges?  Or perhaps, how about 345 
     horses at the flywheel? 
     
     All this combine synergistically to transform the car into a 0 to 60 
     time warp of 4.9 seconds, top speed of 172 mph, and a skid pad test in 
     the .92 g range.  The C5 reaches the quarter mile in a flashy 13.4 
     seconds at 108 mph.  And it does all this without the driver or car 
     breaking a sweat.  No creaks, no groans, no rattles.
     
     And what does all this cost?  How about a push rod 346 cubic inch V8 
     that consumes 28 mpg on the highway and 18 city?  Or, for those of you 
     interested, a $41,000 (estimated) sticker on the side window. 
     
     Time to put that "other" magazine back from where it came.  Now don't 
     think that I have an errant eye.  I am still a purist.  However, it 
     seems there is a little Porsche in all of us these days.  The Porsche 
     front engine water coolers aren't quite dead.  They live on in the 
     rest of the automotive world as technological gifts, transplanted in 
     due time.  It seems, all along, that we were driving symbols of things 
     to come.
