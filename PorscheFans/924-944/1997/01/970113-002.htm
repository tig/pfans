You're talking big bucks for S01 and new wheels. Have you considered
trying road race compound DOT approved tires for the street on your
existing wheels. They will wear out quicker than regular street rubber but
you did say it was a weekend car. If you spinout the car on R tires on the
street your license should be revoked. Bonus is they are cheaper,
typically around $135 each for 245/45x16. I'm partial to BFG R1's. I drive
R tires on the street and hate switching back to the regular stuff.

You can run 245/45's on all 4 corners with 7" & 8" rims on a S2 coupe so
should
work for you. I don't think it will wear out your suspension. A bunch of
us race with this setup all the time, no problem.
