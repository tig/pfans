Hi,

I've just discovered this alias and decided to join. I am based
in England and own a 89 Guards Red 944S2 66K miles. I have a couple
of questions I hope you can all help with.

I have recently noticed that after a cold start gear/shift changes 
into 2nd gear can not be made cleanly. If you let the car roll a
little between 1st and ease into second you can get a reasonable 
change. However anything like what I would  consider a normal change
(which I get in all other gears!) will cause the gearbox to graunch.
Once the car has warmed up, this behaviour more or less disappears
unless you go for a really quick change under fast acceleration.
Has anybody else experienced this type of behaviour or have ideas
on what the problem might be? Am I in for an expensive couple of
months? :-( 

Also I've got my hands dirty in the past with previous cars, and I
would like to do the same with the 944. But the only maintenance
manuals available in the UK only cover up to the 89 944S model.
Any suggestions on good references for 944/S2?

Thanks
Kevin Sigrist
