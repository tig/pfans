	I hope this doesn't come too late to help you out (I'm 1000
	messages behind, literally) but I can vouch for the difference
	between your noise and a sticky lifter. I have one of the sticky
	lifters and the sound is just a light tapping almost as if you
	were to tap on your window glass with a pen. Mine only taps on
	start up when it's very cold and it goes away after 2-3 seconds.
	Your sound seems entirely different. Hope it's not the worst
	case scenario. Good luck!
