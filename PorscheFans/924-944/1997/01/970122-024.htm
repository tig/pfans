<< I have the same problem with my 944, but I do not think that it is a
syncro
 problem. As long as the engine and the gear box are turning at the same
 speed, the syncro is not needed: for example... the engine turns 3,800 RPM
 when the car is moving 30 MPH in second gear.  You should be able to shift
 from 1st to 2nd or 3rd to 2nd without syncros or the clutch as long as the
 car is rolling 30 MPH and you hold the engine at 3,800 RPM. I have found
that
 this can not be done in cold weather.  Also, syncro's should not be
tempature
 sensitive, so that would not explain why it is a cold weather problem
(though
 I sometimes have it when it is warm).  I think that it is more likely that
 there is a fit somewhere in the gear box that gets too tight when it is
cold.
 
 As far as putting engine oil in your rear...... do yourself a favor and
 pretend that it never happened !  Engine oil and gear oil are not even
 remotely similar. It is much more than a differance in viscosity. It has to
 do with one being designed for shearing loads and one for bearing loads (I'm
 not talking about about roller bearing, or babit bearing, but bearing
 stress.)   >>
