ModMech,

This may not be a problem with instrument cluster.  It may be a problem with
the rpm sensor on the engine.  I think the Haynes manual provides testing of
this sensor.

Unfortunately, I had to take apart my '84 944s dash many times.  Luckily I
haven't had to touch my '89 951s dash (yet).  I currently don't have a mpg
gauge, my older 944 did.  The gauge was connected to the tach and had a wire
going to a sensor on the speedometer (this was a mechanical speedometer, not
electrical).  I don't know what the newer dash configs are using.

I'm sure if you fix the tach problem, the mpg would be fixed.  However the
first place I'd look would be the rpm sensor, and make sure that is working.
 It is probably more likely that the sensor connections have come undone than
the dash connections comming undone.

Hope it works out!
