Hi...

I'm new to this list, and also new to the art of buying a Porsche.  I 
was curious if used 944 and 924/924S cars are worth buying.  After 
looking around, I spotted an '87 924S which seemed to be in good 
condition.  Is this a good car??  The owner was asking $6300.  I'm 
looking for something reliable! 

My previous German automobile experience includes a VW Fox.  My 
family has owned Volkswagen's all of my life, and they are very 
dependable.  Is Porsche generally the same way??  Are there any 
problematic years to watch out for w/ the 924 and 944 models??  It 
would be greatly appreciated if anyone could help me out with this! 
:)

Thanks in advance,
Jon
