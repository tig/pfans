Chris,

I take it the rollers have never been replaced? If this is the case
and the car has over 70K or so on it just replace them all. I think
I bought the belts and rollers in a kit for something like $120.

About the only checking you can do is limited to spinning the item
in question after the belts are off, and that isn't going to tell you
very much about what it acts like under load. A couple of them are
likely to be loose and rattle anyway, so just replace all of them
and be done with it.
