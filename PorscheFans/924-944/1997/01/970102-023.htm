I'm not accumulating water in the rear wells, but in the last week have
started  getting rainwater under the passenger's side seat and into the
footwell behind the passenger seat (83 944). Problem is it occurs any time
the car is in the rain, even when it's not moving... just sitting in the
driveway is enough. Floorpan is tight, no holes.

My son theorizes that the drain lines from the sunroof drain is clogged and
water is overflowing the rim and leaking inside. Problem is that the seats,
back deck, all else is dry. Only the floor under the passenger is wet. I've
tried checking the lines from the sunroof drain... they *appear* to be open
(I can blow in the end going through the wheel well and hear the hiss of
air at the sunroof drain).

Question: Any ideas? Other places where I could be going wrong? If I have
to check the drain lines, is pulling the headliner off difficult? It
appears to be molded plastic....
