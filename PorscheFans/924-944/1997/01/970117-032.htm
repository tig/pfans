Thore,

I put a new set of domestic pile carpets in my daughter's car.  I took
out the center console to get the old carpet out.  Make a diagram of how
the instruments are wired, ie.  black wire with the white strip goes to
....... and you should be okay.  The set that I got were not molded to
the body like factory originals.  They were cut and sewen to make the
shape match. The drivers side did not match and the vendor never made it
right. Had to buy another piece of carpet and have my wife sew it up
right.  When it comes time to redo my 924 I am going to buy the carpet,
cut it to fit and have my wife do the sewing.  Hope this helps.

Tom Cooper
