Subj:    winter tires

A list member wrote in recently about choosing winter tires for a 944.

I began to look for appropriate winter tires for my 968 when I bought it in
December.  I had assumed that Blizzaks were the best from reading the Tire
Rack ads.  My P-A dealer recommended Pirelli Winter 210s because he said they
are made with a performance tire construction method and would handle more
like my D40s than Blizzaks would.  The Tire Rack confirmed this, so I bought
them.  Handling seems pretty good, though not as crisp as the D40s,
obviously.  I run 205-55 16s all around.  Winter performance has been
excellent, so I am quite satisfied.
