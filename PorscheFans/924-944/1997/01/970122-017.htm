>Hi P-fans,
>I am new to the list and a new and very happy Porsche 951 owner. My

>Before I purchased the car I had it checked out by the the local Porsche

Coolant is low.   The heater only gets coolant circulation when the engine is
running fast, in this case.   Fill and bleed.

 I also have heard a large rush of water under the
>passenger side footwell when starting the car after it was cold. Both of
>these problems started at the same time.

The above fix should solve this.

 Last, but certainly not
>least...at 80mph in both 4th and 5th gear I have experience what my shop
>calls misfiring. The car begins to buck as if the fuel supply has been
>cut. It does not happen when cruising, only when accelerating.

Start with the knock sensor.   Use the highest octane gas available.

951s often get flogged very hard by their owners.   Who knows what
the PO did?

I might be inclined to "blame" them for the low coolant, since they did
work on the system.  I run a Porsche shop and I have seen the other side
of your question many times.   I feel it is part of my mission in life to tell
my customers if I find something wrong with their cars.   Because of the
expense of some maintenance, a lot of Porsches are undermaintained,
and a lot of them get maintained by shops which should stick to Volks
wagens.   So when they show up in my shop, and I find a lot of stuff to
fix, SOME customers get "worried" .  

Also, fully maintaining aging cars like Porsches is more expensive than
many owners would like to admit.   And, Porsches have more common 
problems than any of us rabid fans would like to admit.  It often becomes
a question of where you draw the line.  I recently processed a 911SC through
my shop for a transmission rebuild.  Before the car left the shop I had replaced
the completely worn out brake pads, the muffler, the heater fan, the chain 
tensioners, and a license place frame.   The customer had been kept 
informed at each step, but still moaned about a really large bill, and 
"why did all this stuff go bad all at once", etc.  

I think you might have a really fine shop.   They might not have bled
the coolant completely, but they sure seem to pass all of the other
tests.  There is a chance that even Bruce Anderson is not perfect!
(Bruce, I don't really believe that!).   The point being that a 71,000
mile car will have some problems and your guys seem to be doing
a good job of finding them.

Good luck.

Dave
