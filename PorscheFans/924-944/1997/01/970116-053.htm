Well, I've become convinced of a couple of things based on responses by 
Dave Cooley, Matt Warner, and Pierre Vezina:

1. Maybe my problem is NOT the oil cooler seals. Another clue is that 
the disptick (the one in the car - not me) shows no sign of water and 
oil mixed. This weekend I'll change the oil and find out for sure.
2. It's probably a good idea to change the seals soon anyway - AND the 
oil pressure relief valve.
3. It ain't all that hard.

Thanks for the VERY inforamtive responses.

Here's another one:

Today at work I noticed some water under the car. Hmmm... I thought - 
could this be from the overflow?

No! it's from the radiator! I have a leak. I have suspected this for 
some time because I have seen water on the thing when looking from 
underneath. Now it appears it's finally giving up. So - I will 
have to change the radiator and hoses.

Question: Does anybody know of any advantage to using a turbo radiator 
on my non-turbo? I plan to race the car if I don't go broke, so some 
extra cooling would be nice. I assume it'll fit and that the hose 
fitting are the same. It looks that way in the Performance catalog. 
Please let me know if I'm wrong!

That's it for now,
