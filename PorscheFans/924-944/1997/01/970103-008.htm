Terry Cleland at Canadian Pragmatics has created exhaust systems for a few
members of Upper Canada Region with 944s. They do custom work but I think
do off-the-shelf stuff too. Obviously, they're best known for the custom
work!

They come highly reccommended by people who's opinion I trust, and I will
be taking my 951 there this summer to receive a new, freer-breathing,
throatier-sounding exhaust. Terry's a member of PCA, and a big supporter of
our Club. He's also a really good guy - some of our local tuners use
Pragmatics for all their exhaust work. And finally, they were featured
about two years ago in Panorama.

Try calling him at (905) 672-0112, even if it's just for an opinion.
