I recently purchased a 1990 944S2 cabriolet with 67,000 miles and love 
the car.  I would like to upgrade the tires for better handling and at 
the same time put new wheels on.  It presently has fairly new Michelin 
XGTV4 tires (205/55 front & 225/50/rear) but I don't like the way they 
feel.  I use the car only on weekends and not on the track but the tires 
feel that they are not sticking to the road and have been advised that 
they are too hard a compound for the cabriolet.  I am considering 
putting on 16" 993 wheels and would like to know if Bridgestone SO1 
tires would offer better performance (205/50 front and 245/55 rear on 7" 
& 9" wheels).  Although the owners manual offers a sport package with 
larger tires for the couple, can the cabriolet take a 245/45 wheel in 
the rear with the stock suspension (I just had all new stock struts and 
shocks installed)or will it put a strain on the suspension?
Also, I would like to reduce the amount of body flex in the front end of 
the cab, even over small road irregularities.  Will a Cambermeister 
mounted between the front shock towers help eliminate this flex?
If anyone has any thoughts on the above, I would appreciate hearing 
them.
Thank you in advance.
Mike
