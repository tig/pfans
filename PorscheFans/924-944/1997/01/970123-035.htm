Purchase your Haynes manual (cheap) and adjust the clutch pedal free play, 
and the clutch release travel.  The pedal free play shouldn't be more 
than 3 mm.  If this doesn't change matters, bleed the clutch hydraulic 
fluid.

This is normal, and gets a little worse as the car ages.  The type of oil 
in the transmission can have an effect, too.  It seems that a gear (5th, 
I think) rattles on the mainshaft, and you can hear it at idle.  The 
long driveshaft just seems to amplify the noise at low speeds.  Porsche 
is aware of this and has refused warranty claims on this, so we all live 
with it.  My ex-924 did it, and the 944 does, too.  Its a good reminder 
to downshift if you are lugging around town.

Part of the experience.  Enjoy your car!

Not many problems on the West coast of the US.. mostly kids in crummy 
Mustangs or Camaros that want to race at stoplights - not often enough to 
be a bother.
