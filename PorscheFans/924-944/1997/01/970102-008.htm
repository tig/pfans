I've messed around with the AC compressor on a late '85 944 extensively
when installing a supercharger, and they can be a bit of a pain.  It's
fairly hard to get to the mounting bolts, and very easy to overtighten
these bolts before you do the final tension adjustment on the belt.  This
can snap the bolts, or in my case, the rear threaded sleeve on the
compressor.  I would think that the sleeve would go before the bolts would
snap.  You're lucky the sleeve didn't crack; AC compressors are expensive.

As far as labor-intensive, maybe the S2 was more stuff around the
compressor, but I didn't find the job to be much of a problem, just a pain
getting the rear bolt in place.  If your mechanic is having problems, he
can always remove the wheel well partition.  Overall, this is not a big
deal.  IMHO, your mechanic is a wimp, or feeding you a line.

I should also add that the only time I've had a compressor shake loose was
on a rebuilt engine from the idiots at Vertex who installed a balance shaft
upside down.  That produced a LOT of engine vibration.  But you might have
your mechanic use some Locktite on the bolts just to be safe.
