Hi, Mike,

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news: 

If one wheel turns in one direction and the other wheel turns in the 
opposite direction, you have a transaxle with an open differential in it...
You do not have a factory limited slip...

(There is a very slight chancethat it has a Quaife LSD in it, but I don't
know 
how these work with this kind of test.)

It doesn't matter what came with the car, or what the transaxle case says,
you have an open differential in it... 

This is not an uncommon problem, inasmuch as it takes about 2 hours to 
swap a transaxle in a 944 car. 


Good Luck!
