My '84 924 suffers from exactly the same problem (among other 
problems...)...Reading your post is as if I hear myself talking to a 
mechanic!
I allready have had a lot of work done on my car, both by an 
authorized P dealership and another shop (a whole lot less expensive!). 
Amongst the parts that have been replaced: both fuelpumps, all filters, 
ignition wires/plugs and the starter.
The new starter was an improvement, but still the car starts better 
when it sits overnight....is this normal???
I still plan on replacing the fuelpump relay 'cause when I turn the 
key 2 notches the pump should start and then stop after 2 sec...mine 
just keeps running and sometimes it doesn't seem to work at all...when 
I start the car everything is allright again. The P-mechanic told me 
it's nothing to worry about....should I go ahead and replace it?

again...I noticed the exact same thing and I also checked the same 
seal/connectors. 

Any help or advice would be very much appreciated!
