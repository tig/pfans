Ross, I will give you some short two-cent opinions, point by point.  
Porsches are not unlike girl friends.  I might not like yours, but
if you do, that's cool.   They all seem to get to exciting answers
using different equations along the way.

They will ALL work for this.   All of the water-pumpers will have better
(more conventional) handling, and are generally more forgiving at the
limit.

With snow tires, they will all work.  However, the big drawback for 911s in
the winter is cooling/heating.   Below 20 degrees they begin to become a 
pain.   They chill so badly they can be very hard to start; conversely, their
heaters will never match that of any waterpumper.   This may not be a real
factor in mild Vancouver, but it still counts.

I don't know if I could have put it better.   It is really a matter of
taste.  911s
are unconventional cars, and you sort of have to love them to even like them.
Their ergonomic deficiencies were NEVER  fixed, until they became 993s, and
even then they retain their peculiar personalities.  I am at a loss to explain
heater controls to anybody, and the rest of the dash layout is a bit behind the
Japanese in logic, etc.   The 944/968 clan is certainly more modern, if you 
car about that.  You can get used to either.

That counts for a lot.  Again, you might not like my girl friend......I
don't care.

>
>Would anyone who's driven both the 944S2 and 911 Carrera care to comment
>on the differences? On your feelings, emotions, etc when you see/drive
>these cars?

For a daily driver, I absolutely love the smooth, soft caress of any 944.  I
still love
the quick, sporty, precise feel of a 911.  On the track, I tend to feel less
precarious
in a 944 (actually I drive a 928 most of the time), yet I can wring a lot
out of a 911
when I get serious.  The only gremlin lurking in my subconscious is that 911
engine
wanting to lead through any corner at the limit.  Beyond the limit, the 911
can be
a serious handful to gather up, where all of the waterpumpers sort
themselves out
if I just get off the gas.   

This is the area where YOU need to do some test driving and decide what turns
YOUR crank.  Don't shy away from the big horsepower, notably the Turbo S.  You 
will grow into it, and will always want more anyway.  You don't have to use
it.  It's
like dating, to extend my tired analogy.

There aren't as many as you would think, and I can't remember many.  
Engine differences are minimal.  You might like the hydraulic clutch after
1987.  Most other changes are small and shouldn't be a decision factor over
mileage and condition.  The conventional wisdom is get the youngest, nicest
example you can afford.  

Hope this helps.   Did you even consider a 928?
