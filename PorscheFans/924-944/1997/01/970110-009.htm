Hi P-Fans

	I have a 951 that I purchased about a year and a half ago 
to replaced a 944 that was killed by a hit and run driver on my
40th birthday. (Needless to say I was very upset). I proceeded 
to “Davidized” the car, new struts,shocks,rack and pinion (leaking),
strut brace(if you don’t have one, get one) and I  just replaced the turbo
water pump (burned-up). The car is an 87 and has 77k miles. About six 
months ago I began experiencing a power loss at about 4k RPM.
This is a complete loss of power as if the rev limiter is engaging.
As soon as the RPM’s drop the engine starts again. This has 
happened about 3 times. Usually I am in 3 gear accelerating,
my head tries to bounce against the window and I have 
to get in the slow lane. I don’t mine the headache, but to get
in the slow lane is very upsetting. The articles I have read,have
said anything from the “DME” (expensive) to the “X-relay”
(cutting off the fuel pump). Does anybody have any incite to 
this problem. The previous owner only put on 10k miles in 3 
years he did not drive it very hard. When I bought it the only 
problem was that it changed lanes by itself. I found that when he 
had the tires rotated, they also rotated an 8in rim to the front. 
Thanks for your help,
