Gee that sounds cool, how many races do they have you can drive to? I live
in Seattle;-(

Why is a closed trailer such a problem for people? We race a lot of SCCA
Solo in street prepared and I hear this complaint a lot, I don't get it. 
  
 It's a bit discouraging to find out that your

Why is preparing a car to the extent of the rules such a bad thing? Or are
you dissappointed by the allowences in the rules in the stock classes? It
would seem to me that these rules were established to accomadate the typical
mods porschephiles make to their cars, am I off base here?

 Also

Wanna know how many "STOCK" 180hp G class cars I watched outpull turbo S
944s last month at 2 different events? My point is that the only thing I
have ever seen checked at a PCA event is weight. IMNSHO this is not near
enough scrutiny. How any scumbag could sleep at night after finishing first
with an illeagal car or why they would not class the car HONESTLY in the
class it belongs in I have no idea!! For a peice of wood that's 2" larger in
diameter than the other guys? Gimme a break!

Since some of the same guys are having success in pro racing venues I think
this is very true that the level of talent in PCA is high.
 
 Also not surprisingly he has been

I have never heard of anything like this happening but I like the fact they
threw the bum out ;-)
 
>I guess the point is that PCA Club Racing is less of a venue for GrassRoots
>motorsporting than it used to be

It is almost the ONLY truley grassroots venue considering you could still
drive your car to and from event if you live close enough ;-)
 
  Some other injustices in PCA racing to me are: letting an RSA add
strategicly placed balast and run in F as a C2! How about a turbo look 180hp
SC (that outpulled 944TS) running 9" & 10" wheels!?!? How do you get to
those wheel sizes from here? I don't get it! I was told by a rulemaker that
the 944S2 should not have been moved from G to F had they been able to check
chips last year!! How do ya like that?!

  IMNSHO it's the way the rules are enforced (or not) that is causing a
problem, but I hear it's gonna get much better this year ;-)
  Did you see where the added wings will move you up now? I like it!
