Yup, seen this new Corvette.  Used to race B Production with a 65 Vette many 
moons ago.  At the time the Pcar competition was the 911.  It was my feeling 
at the time, that the track prepped Vette was much more driver friendly than 
the 911.  We beat 'em down the straights and they ruled the twisties. 
 
I'm an EOD (Equal Opportunity Driver) and don't discriminate based on marques. 
If the Corvette club did more than polish and pose, like, had a club racing 
program........I'd be the first one on my block to get a C5....and I'd be 
posting my 944 track car for sale....That car's a lot of bang for the buck and 
will eat into Boxter sales..... 
 
Oh well, maybe in 5 years when the C5 is a 12K car used..........stranger 
things have happened......
