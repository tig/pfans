In a message dated 97-01-28 23:43:37 EST, you write:

<< there is NO power steering fluid in the car, and I am wondering if there
is
 a common point of failure in the PS system on 944's? >>

I blew out a high pressure power steering line on my 85.5 -- that's one
possibility.

<<Also upon closer inspection, the motor mounts seem fine, but the car does
need a "tune up", it shakes at idle but runs great at anything above ~1000
RPM >>

Could still be the motor mounts.  You can't really tell by looking when
they're 
installed in the car.  Shaking at idle is a telltale sign.

<<I noticed there is a small exhaust passage which
runs from the exhaust pipe just behind the O2 sensor into the engine
compartment.  It is capped off.  >>

It's a remnant of the test pipe which came up into the engine compartment to
allow for exhaust testing upstream of the cat.  Unlike the rest of the
exhaust
system (fortunately) these tubes seemed to rust off very quickly.  Most
people
probably did as I did; priced the replacement, caught their breath and capped
off the stub.  Not a problem.

<<I also need parts sources>>
 
You should subscribe to Excellence and join PCA  to get Panorama (among other
things).  They are both full of ads, as well as technical advice.

Have fun!
