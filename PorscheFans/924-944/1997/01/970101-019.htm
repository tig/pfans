If your clutch were slipping, you would see a clear rpm increase with no
increase in speed/acceleration.  And once clutches start to go, they kinda
keep going.

The 4 valve heads of 944s and 928s both have an occasional problem with
spark plug insulators breaking down and allowing spark impulses to escape
directly through to the head.  It usually starts insidiously, as yours has,
and comes and goes for a while.  Pulling them and carefully inspecting them
for arcing/burned spots might locate the problem.  You can wrap them with
electrical tape and the problem will go away for a long time.  Or you can
buy a new harness for a whole lot of money.

Let us know what you find.



>Recently after about 1 hour of highway driving my engine started to
>hesitate.  It almost felt like the clutch disk was going.  After making
>it into a local town I suspected the worst and decided to get some
>coffee.  When I came out and restarted the car the hesitation was gone
>and the car ran fine for the rest of the trip.  This problem hasn't
>happened again.  My question is could this just be vapor lock or maybe
>some water in the tank?  Maybe just a can of Techron could correct it? 
>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
