Not an especially good idea;  can lead to other problems.

 What do you

At least.

 Rebuild the entire transmission?

Always include first and third.   Fourth and fifth would be optional.

Depends on the money differential.   Only you can tell.   Either way
you end up with a rebuilt transmission.  

Any idea of what the cost would be? I am a fair "shadetree" mechanic.

You need to actually shop around.

>How about the difficulty of removing the transmission myself and installing

Perhaps three hours the first time around.   Mechanically straightforward.
