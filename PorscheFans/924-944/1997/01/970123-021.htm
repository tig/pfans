What does a "normal" 944 clutch feel like in terms of length of travel
till release and pressure? My '84 944 has a clutch that releases almost at
the top of the pedal's travel, but with no slippage at all I am not too
concerned. Also, how are the brake and clutch hydraulic systems connected?
I know they share a common reservoir of fluid, but how does bleeding the
brake hydraulics affect the slave cylinder/clutch? How does one bleed just
the clutch, and does this make a difference in pedal travel till release?

And about oil changes, isn't it safer to go by the amount of abuse the oil
has taken (color, viscosity) rather than rules about miles driven or time
periods? I have always changed oil when I begin to see carbon deposits or
a change in viscosity, and this has averaged around 4-5 months between
changes. There have been exceptions though, depending on weather, a
temporary switch in brand, a temporary speeding streak in me (!), a six
month vacation with a garaged 944, and in these cases the change periods
varied between a month and 8 months. Going by time/mileage rules in these
situations would have done my car no good. Is there something wrong with
going by the condition of the oil for oil change intervals? Am I missing
something?
