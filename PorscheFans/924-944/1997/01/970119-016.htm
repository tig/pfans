Wow!  Wish my '89 had that low mileage.

After checking the fan switch and its connector for any misbehaviour, I
would suspect the resistor pack (which allows different fan speeds) and
its connections on top of the fan motor.  It would be best if you obtained
a Haynes manual (under $20.00) and referred to page 99 for the procedure. 
In brief, pry out the plastic clip at the front edge of the motor cover,
then pull up on the motor cover while cutting the adhesive that seals it
to the base.  Use a utility knife of some sort.  You have to pry on the
bracket to remove the resistor pack.  Check for connection tightness - if
the problem persists, check for voltage at the motor terminals with the
key and fan switch on.  Also, try substituting another resistor pack or 
motor, if voltage is present and it doesn't run.


Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.  Eugene, OR.  Ready to have new alternator and PS belt

				    loose on the adjuster bar!
