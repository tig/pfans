The car is a 951, however I don't think it is turbo related.

My car has been in the garage for a few months now.  Last night I went out to
start it up.  I've been starting the car atleast every two weeks.  The temp was
a little above freezing.  After starting it, I noticed a loud clacking sound
coming from the engine.  At idle, the sound comes about 3 (a little over 3, my
idle is at 800-900rpm) times a second.  It appears to come from either the cam
shaft or the head.  I can feel the fuel rail vibrate with the noise, however I
can't feel any vibrations through the camshaft housing.

The noise increases with engine speed.  Pulling the plug wires and
disconnecting each injector did not affect the noise.

I currently have Valvoline 20-50 non-synthetic motor oil in the engine.

Since last starting it, I removed the DME and the KLR computers, checked the
chips (autothority, stage 1 & 2), re-installed the two computers.

Today I drove the car so it would fully warm up, however it did not have an
affect on the noise.

My fear is it is a bad valve.  I haven't yet pulled the cam off, and really
wasn't expecting to have to.

Can someone help diagnose this?

thanks
