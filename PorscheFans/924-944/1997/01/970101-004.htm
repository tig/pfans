James Stapleton wrote in inquiring about buying a 1992 968, 75k miles, good
condition.  Since 968-related notes seem few and far-between (am I the only
968 owner on the list?), I'll take a stab at answering.

I purchased a 1992 968 a few weeks ago (guards red, 49k miles, excellent
condition, one owner, all records from the local dealer and purchased from
that dealer, no salt or smoke, lowered to Euro spec height).  Price was
$19,990.  I had previously test driven a 1986 944 turbo fairly extensively.

The 968 feels to me like a slightly harder-edged 944.  The motor is VERY
strong and torquey, but not as smooth as the 944 T.  Obviously, there is no
turbo lag or need for turbo-type extra maintenance or hassle (turbo timers,
spool-down, frequent oil changes, etc.).  Handling is similar to the 944,
although my reduced ride height may reduce wheel travel as well.  Both cars
are a dream to drive on a windy road, with the 968 much more predictable than
my 91 MR2 turbo.  The 6 speed trans is cool in theory, but the extra gear is
unnecessary with such a torquey motor.  The ratios are very closely spaced,
with 6th being numerically about where 5th would be in a 944, so I end up
skipping gears pretty often.

Performance in the 968 is awesome.  236 horsepower and almost that much
torque.  I read a road test result of 0-60 in 5.6 sec, with the factory
claiming 6.1.  Top speed is 156 mph.  It seems to me that these numbers are
roughly similar to Carreras of that era, with more predictable handling.

As you might expect, build quality is superb.  Styling is a personal issue.
 I think that both the 944 T and 968 are very handsome.  I do like the
928-style headlights on the 968, especially when up, and the front fenders
are more interesting on the 968.  The rear of a 944 T is probably better
looking.

Overall, I think the newer car without a turbo is probably easier to drive
and a better choice.  Others will no doubt disagree, since both models are a
real pleasure.

Please feel free to address any specific questions to me directly if you
wish.  Good luck!
