Just dropped the pan and replaced the rod bearings in my 83 944 trackker.  84 
motor had 45K miles on it and one year of heavy track usage(4 club races, 5 
time trials, 3 open track events and a drivers school).  The old bearings were 
like new.  I have an 88 oil pan and baffle, otherwise stock.  Some locals 
claim that certain turns create the problem, like #6 at Thunderhill but no 
problem so far on R rated race tires. 
 
I also run the car 1/2 quart over the top of the dipstick and check it 
religiously after every run session. HInt: pop the hood before exiting the car 
after each session to remind you to check.  May use 1/4 qt. in a weekend with 
either Mobil 1 or Amsoil.   
 
I think the later pan baffle does help alot.  Oil temp runs up to 240 degrees 
with a remote cooler. 
 
We've been toying with building a GT car, turbo drive line and dry sumping 
seems like the only solution to counteract the extra Gs from bigger slicks and 
more power. With the NA cars, the later pan seems to do it for me.
