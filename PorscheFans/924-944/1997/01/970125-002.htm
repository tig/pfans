When I bought my 92 968 a few weeks ago, the salesman at the Porsche
dealership pointed out that it had been lowered to "Euro Spec," which he said
was about an inch.  The car does indeed look lower than a stock 968.

1.  Was there a Porsche kit available from the dealer to lower 968s?  Or was
this an aftermarket modification?  How can I tell?  The previous owner got
all of his service at the dealer, but he could have modified the car
elsewhere, I suppose.

2.  I have not driven a 968 set at the usual US height.  Is there a
significant ride difference?  My 968 feels pretty stiff, but that's mainly
because the roads in the Midwest are so broken up.  I know that I do not have
the sport suspension, since the car has the standard 16" wheels rather than
the 17s.  

3.  On the track (driving school), does the lowering help handling a lot?
 How about on the street?

Thanks for the info!
