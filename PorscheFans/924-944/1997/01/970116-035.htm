Karl,

I'll bet this is something to do with your charging system. If it can't 
produce adequate power at idle speed, the battery will drain, and 
eventually the battery will drain and you'll run out of charge.

I don't know how much weather can affect the charging system, but have 
it checked at a shop. The resistor may be cracked or something.

Another thing - I have had problems with icing of the battery terminals 
before that have caused similar problems - remove the battery cables 
from the posts and clean the terminals and insdie the cable connections, 
then re-install.

BTW - I have heard that it is OK to forget warming the car since the 
transmission doesn't benefit from it (it's in the back of the car). In 
theory - not good to run a warm motor and cold transmission.
