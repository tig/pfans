Hi Michael,

Try just removing the sunroof switch from the system first.  You have to
lift up the console to do it.  You will accomplish two things; remove power and
verify the color code of the wires (there are six of them on the switch
alone).  

The instrument cluster is modular,  and the speedometer is not really wired
separately.  You might have better luck in the fuse/relaybox.  Foreign material 
in there could short just about anything.  On the other hand, with Porsche 
electrics, almost anything can happen.  I have never seen wires short each
other in the factory configuration, but yes it could happen.  

I would follow the roof switch wires all the way to the box.  

This is a neat project, almost endless it would seem.  There are nearly 
forty wires associated with the roof in one way or another........relays, 
limit switches.....

Scratching my graying head.

Dave


>Hello.  I have an 86 944 non-turbo.  My problem is that when I have my
