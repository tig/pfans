	Well, the dealers and the shops recomend it so they can make
	money off you. Remember, every little bit helps and a dealership
	will probably charge about $150 to change the oil on a 964 because
	of all the undercarraige stuff that has to be removed (assuming
	the owner wasn't smart enough to remove it herself). How often
	it should be changed is still a matter of debate; personally, I
	change mine about every 4K or so. Oil and filters are cheaper
	than engines.
