When I purchased my 951S in Houston and drove it back  to Canada it
suffered from a loud bearing type noise. The shop that inspected the car
indicated that while they weren't able to pinpoint the problem they felt
that it was probably the rear wheel bearing. After driving back to
Canada I got a quote from my p-mechanic on replacing the rear bearings.
A friend of mine who worked in a tire shop suggested I check the rear
tires first. Even though the rear tires had quite a bit of tread left he
asked me to let him have a look at the tires. He said that a number of
supposed bearing problems on cars with wide tires was actually due to
uneven tire wear. Sure enough, we put on new tires and the noise was
gone. A much easier solution than replacing the wheel bearings.
