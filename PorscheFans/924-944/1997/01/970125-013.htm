Hello Porsche Fans,

I have another problem.  This morning I started the car but the car
would'nt hold an idle.  It was trying (varing between 200 to 1200 rpms)
but just died.  Started the car again and the only way to keep from
stalling was to press the accelerator and keep it idling at 1000rpms. 
Drove a few miles until I came to a light and the car would idle but it
wasn't around the 1000 rpm mark so I would puth the car in neutral and
my foot on the accelerator.

Drove the car to work and now the car doesn't have a problem
mainitaining an idle.  The weather is rainy and rather warm (mid 40's) if
that makes a difference.

I would appreciate any insights to what the problem may be.

Karl
