Hi, Don,

I'm just finishing up a clutch job on my Turbo.  The friction material on my old clutch 
disk was nice and thick.  So, what was the problem?  Several of the smaller springs in 
the center of the disk were either broken or missing.  This seems to be common, though 
maybe not on the same scale as the rubber-centered clutch disk failures.  This may be 
your problem, but you'll want to get the opinion of someone more knowledgeable than 
myself.  Several of the list members also recommend the Turbo Cup clutch disk as a 
replacement for the original design.  The set of larger center springs are retained, but 
the smaller springs are deleted.  I hope this helps.
