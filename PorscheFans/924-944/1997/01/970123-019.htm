>1. My console has the three toggle switches on the left, one

****That's exactly what it is--a speaker balance switch.  It may have been
disconnected as some people like to control balance and left and right from
the tape or CD unit itself.  Mine works, though I never use it.

>2. The former owner lost the alarm key. Local key shop says if

*****The lock is not complicated.  A good locksmith can make a key for you
right there on the spot without having to disassemble the lock.  The PO to
my car didn't have the key, and I hired a locksmith who came out, took an
impression of some sort by inserting a blank into the lock, then made a key
for me right there.  It was insanely easy, and I wonder whether or not that
alarm is of any real value!  Seems it can be turned off an on with relative
ease.

>3. Any recommendations on floor mats? I need some. I have no idea what
>the stock ones look like, so don't know if I want those or others. Can anyone
>tell me what the stock front mats look like? Plain black or what? My interior
>is black.

*****If your carpet is black, stock mats will be black as well.  They're
nice but expensive and in my opinion not worth to buy new.  I bought some
Lloyd mats from Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories some years ago.  They
are black and I had them custom designed with the Porsche crest and "turbo"
script underneath in red.  These mats are available from a lot of places
now.  I also have them on my Alfa.  There has been a lot of talk about the
Porsche crest disappearing because of licensing arrangements.  Lloyd Design
Group is, I believe, still licensed to produce them, and they are of high
quality.  Figure about $90 for a set of plain, front mats with no fancy
design.  Try MotorCars International in 1-800-977-9707.
