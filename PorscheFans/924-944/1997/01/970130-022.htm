the night before and the awe when I opened the innards of the this little
swiss watch wannabe!

Same problem - melted plastic in the path of one of the sliding contacts.
Used up an exacto and a lot of band-aids getting rid of the melted plastic,
cleaned the yellowing terminals with alcohol and more exacto.
Unfortunatelt at this point the little center rocker ball-on-a-spring
rolled off and did not come back. I was not about to give up and stuck a
1/4" screw with an approximately round head inside the spring and stuck
that into the upper half of the switch. All the switch functions checked
out fine with an ohm-meter, the rheostat worked fine too.

5,000 miles and 6 months later I had completely forgotten about this gem
of improvisation till I read your post! To be honest at the time I made
lots of mental notes to order the part (Auto Atlanta, $25), but the switch
works so well I guess it slipped into the subconscious. Remember not to
use the dimmer any more than necessary -- that is how my melt-down
happened after a long night drive with the lights dimmed and the little
rheostat pumping out joules of energy into the vintage VW plastic. Good
luck.
