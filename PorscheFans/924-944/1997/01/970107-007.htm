>The mirrors on a 944 can be repaired depending on the problem. The haynes
manual does tell you how to remove the glass, but is not too clear. At the
bottom edge of the glass, if you look with a light you should see three
notches   . Place a small blade screwdriver with the blade up and down into
one of the notches and slowly side it to the right. There is a ring that
holds the glass to the motor and you are loosening the ring. Once the glass
is loose it should come away from the mirror assembly. The wires attached
to the glass are for the heated mirrors. Once inside you can see what the
problem is. Remember a new mirror unit is about $500 or more.

>Does anyone know if the 944 mirrors are repairable?  My left mirror will
>not turn left and right with the electric switch (the up and down movement
>works fine), but feels very loose when the mirror is pushed/pulled side to
>side by hand.  It feels like a mechanical connection has become untethered.
>
>I spent some time looking at how I might dismantle the mirror, but there
>does not seem to be an obvious method at hand.
