Hi, I'm a new member to the list, and do not own a Porsche as of yet.  I am
contemplating the purchase of a ~'82 944.  The asking price is $3995, and
the car has almost exactly 99K miles.  I have test driven the car and would
like to get some feedback before I plunk down the cash.

First off, let me give you a little background.  I am mechanically
inclined, and have owned two '80's Datsun 280ZX's and a Toyota which I have
maintained myself, performing everything from oil changes, water pump and
alternator changes, to strut and ball joint replacement, and am about to
replace the timing belt on the Toyota.  I even rebuilt my own L-Jetronic
air flow sensor!  Do you think I can maintain the 944 myself? Does it
require many "shop tools?"  Do parts cost about the same as the Datsun and
Toyota parts?

The car seems to run well.  The engine idles rough, but accelerates well
and runs smooth.  There is a lot of play in the driveline, and some
"whine", but it isn't excessively loud.  The shifter needs help, it is VERY
loose, and I suspect it needs bushings replaced somewhere.

My questions are:

1) Is the car worth ~$3500 I'm going to offer for it?

2) Can I fix this thing myself for a reasonable price?

3) Can I spend more time driving it than fixing it?

4) Are the problems I have noticed normal for this car at this age and
mileage?

5) What other pit-falls are there I should watch out for?

I will be heading to the car lot later today to put a deposit on it, so
please e-mail me (preferable at my address listed below) as soon as
possible so I can make a more informed decision.  

TIA
