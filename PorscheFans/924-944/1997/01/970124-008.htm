A few years back I had a conversation with one of the SWEPCO company
representatives.  We were conversing about oil and oil change intervals.
One of the services that SWEPCO offers free for their oil customers is oil
analysis.  The representative explained that their commercial customers,
such as municipalities, use the oil analysis technique to determine their
oil change periods. The reason they do this is to minimize their expanses
by changing oil only when it is required.

The point here is that you too could do this and optimize oil change
intervals, but without knowing what byproducts, such as combustion acids,
are flowing around your engine parts, and how long they are sitting there,
you are just throwing dice.  How can you really analyze your oil by just
looking at it?

As I posted yesterday, the costs of oil changes are trivial.  It is easy to
justify costs for cosmetic and performance upgrades.  We feel or see the
improvements.  Most of us pay collision insurance premiums on our cars and
would continue to pay after the banks have been paid off.  That yearly
premium is not trivial for me.  (about $500.00 each year for both cars).
The cost of oil changes is cheap insurance for the engine in comparison.

Post Script:

I have not heard one person ever recommend the 15,000 mile change interval
endorsed by the factory.  These cars cost too much money.  This ain't you
father's Oldsmobile.
