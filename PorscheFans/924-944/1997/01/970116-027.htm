Hello.  I have an 86 944 non-turbo.  My problem is that when I have my
sunroof 100% closed, it detatches as soon as I put the car in gear and begin
rolling. I can hear the humming of the sunroof motor while rolling.  It stops
humming the very instant that the car stops completely.  I figure that one of
the speedometer wires is shorting on one of the sunroof wires.  However, the
problem is only with unlocking the sunroof.  There is no problem (humming of
the sunroof motor) when the sunroof is open even the slightest bit.  The
sunroof doesn't go down by itself, it just unlocks when closed 100% the very
second I begin to move.  Does anybody know what wires to look for when I
attempt to open up the dash and look behind the speedometer?  Do these wires
(sunroof and speedo) come close to each other anywhere?  
                                       


                                                                        Thank
You in advance
