Mike,

If bad rod-bearings and a cracked oil pan are the only things wrong with the
car, go ahead and get them fixed/replaced.  You'll probably need the crankshaft
reground and polished.  The cylinders and cylinder head may be okay.  I don't
know how adept you are mechanically, but you could do it yourself.

However if you have someone else do it, it may be cheaper to go ahead and buy a
short block and rebuild the engine around it (i.e. you can probably keep all
the parts of the previous engine, and just install them onto the new block.

However if you get a good engine for a few grand it may be worth it to just
swap engines, and sell off the old one.
