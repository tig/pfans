I have an '88 944Turbo that I've put up for sale.  Basically, I wan't to
get another Porsche, but am not really convinced what to get ( and what
I can afford!! ).  I like the 944, but I'm not that thrilled about the
turbo.  Sure you get lots of high end power, but I'd rather have more
torque and power at lower RPMs, even if it's not as 'fast'.  I've
thought about  '87 928 w/ a stick.  I test drove an automatic...I felt
like I was in the Space Shuttle.  It was not fun.  I've also test driven
a '91 944S2 which did seem to have more pull down low.  The 968 is out
of the question ( too much $$$ ).  I've even been thinking that (gasp) a
Porsche is not the car I'm looking for to satisfy my unsophisticated
desires. Maybe a late model Mazda RX7.
Anyway right now I've got my eye on a '91 944S2 which looks like it
might be my best bet.  Does anyone have any advice or opinions about
these two cars?  Specifically, an '88 944Turbo and a '91 944S2.

Thanks
