Hello Everyone.

As my pristine german steed lays dormant in my garage, sheltered from the
elements and enemies (Read, Hit and run, Scum, vandals.etc.) I enlist the
help of our enlightend group for some help with a couple of traits my car
has been displaying.

1. The PO of my car while taking fair care of it neglected the brake
fluid. Now 2 liters of bleeding later and I am still left with a sort of
sludge inside my system. Is a shop better equiped to remidy this or can I
?

2. How does one test the engine speed sensors located on top of the
bell-housing. They are out of the car and I suspect I can test them with a
standard multimeter (DVM) but the Haynes manual as usual is light in this
area.

3. The car has a slight rumble with the throttle switch plugged in.
Unplugged it goes away. Only the throttle switch tests fine..Any comments?

As usual thanks to those who reply.

Anthony Kalcounis
