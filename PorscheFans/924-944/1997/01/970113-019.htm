Thanks David,

Once I get this "stethoscope" do I check rollers with the cover off and the
engine running?  (reconnect the airbox, and start it up?)  This sounds a little
dangerous to me, so I'm assuming I use the stethoscope and turn the rollers by
hand.

I tore everthing apart Sunday.  Due to the cold I quit after removing the
covers to the belts.  I still need to remove the starter to put in the flywheel
lock.  Unfortunately the starter seems to be attached by a torx head bolt, and
the torx socket does not fit over it. (limitted space)  Odd the other bolt is a
normal hex head...

Anyway, while under there I noticed oil seapage where the bell house connects
to the engine.  Another problem?

Also, I noticed oil on top of the water pump.  I'm not sure where it comes
from.  I just changed the cam seal.  I guess I'll have to look again. :(

What do I have to do to remove the rear belt cover?  Can I get away with just
removing the belts, then removing it, or do I have to yank some pulleys also?

Last, but not least.  The noise seems to originate from the lower balance shaft
area.  It is a loud whine, becomes higher in frequency with engine rpm.  I'm
wondering if the noise is originating from the balance shaft belt running on
the idler?  The belt is toothed, and the idler smooth.  Currently the belt just
touches the idler.  What is the purpose of the idler?  To stop belt slap?  How
close is the belt suppose to run on the idler.

Thanks for all the help!
