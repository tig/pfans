I don't know if you have already solved the problem this w/e (I hope so).  If 
not, one tool that might come in handy before you take the car apart.  For 
about $10 you can buy an automotive stethoscope.  Similar to a Dr.'s, except 
the probe is a thin hollow metal tube about 12" long.  Once you remove the 
covers, you can place the probe onto the mounting bolt for each roller, and 
when you hit the right one, there will be no question to your ears that you 
found it.  (remember to check the H20, auto chain tensioner (if installed), [ 
"easy" to remove the auxiliary equipment belts firs (p/s, a/c, alternator) and 
start the car, you'll eliminate them as a potential problem].

Tell us how you made out.

Good Luck,
