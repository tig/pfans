Hi everybody,

OK ok i know all i do is ask questions, but this one has got me.
i ordered a front control arm for my 84 944 and i got it in the 
mail today.  When i oppened it up, the bushings were not attached,
instead they were in their own little baggies.   Also there was no
ball joint and the ball joint seems like it needs to be pressed
on along with the bushings.  When i ordered it i asked if it came
with "everything" and the guy said yes.  Is this the way they come?
If so, how am i supposed to get the bushings and ball joint on? Just
in case you are curious, i ordered it from "Alpine Imports", does anyone
know anything about these guys?

Any information about these control arms would be greatly appreciated,

thank you,

kevin
