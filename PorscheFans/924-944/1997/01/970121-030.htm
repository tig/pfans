What would anyone want with a Boxster if a 911 Turbo (admittedly a used one)
costs the same? Not that I don't like the Boxster, but with only $5k more for
a 911 Turbo I'd choose that every day of the week?  Here, we'd be lucky to
get a '79 911 Turbo at that price.  Why are Porsches considered luxury cars
in USA when they are this cheap?
