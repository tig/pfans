20psi of boost?  Jeesh.  What is the longevity of these engines?  (I know you
said they were used for drag only, but still)  Also, what are the weakness of
these engines?  Do they tend to blow head gaskets, or do the transmissions
usually go out first?  I don't think the intercooler would help much on a dyno,
unless someone had a fan to cool it off...
