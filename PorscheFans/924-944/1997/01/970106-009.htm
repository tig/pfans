I used to have one of those (with the torn seal).  Seems to me the part was
actually about $60.00, but I do not remember from where.  Shop around some
more.  Automation is not known for the lowest prices.

I would replace it with a new one.  I think you should keep wax away from
the seal as well.  Replacement is not too bad, but take your time to get it
on right.
