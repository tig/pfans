Hey guys,

The snow is finally gone.  The Porsche ran very well during that time.
I used Pirelli 210 snows on the rear and my summer Dunlops up front.  It
was not the optimal setup, but it worked in Blizzard like conditions we
had up here in B.C.  I felt like Kankunen (sp?) sliding around the corners,
it was very fun.

The frothy oil turned out to just be what some list members said, the 
moisture in the oil from driving short distances.  Now that I'm driving
longer distances and on boost more, it's almost all gone from the oil
cap.  The coolant level is back to normal too, except for this one damn
air bubble somewhere in the system!

Lastly, the racing season will be starting soon.  I've ordered a set of
wheels.  They are the 944 Turbo Club Sport wheels 16x8 up front and 16x9
in the rear.  I'd like to run 245/45R16 all around, but I don't know if the
Hoosier AS302 will rub up front a lot (the Hoosiers are quite a bit wider
than the R1).  Whatever the case, I have a set of Hoosiers laying around
from my previous car so I'll stick them on to test the fit.

And, since the racing season is coming up, that means the drag track is
opening too and I want to get my car out there to see what she'll do.  I'm
not too concerned with ET, I'm more so concerned with the MPH as the saying
I like to use goes, "ET tells you how good the driver is, MPH tells you
how good the car is".  I'm looking for a baseline number for a stock
Turbo or Turbo S if anyone has any info from magazine reports, etc.  I've
seen everything from 98mph to 102mph for the Turbo S, that's a big spread.

My Turbo S computers are on their way (finally), so I can do some back
to back testing of the Autothority to my chip package.

Farzaan.
1989 Porsche 944 Turbo S - 14psi.
Burnaby, B.C. Canada.
