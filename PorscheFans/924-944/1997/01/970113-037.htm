lRegarding the petcock drain plugs:  There is an old wives (husbands) tale
that the arms can be hit by debris, knocked into the "drain" position and
perhaps
cost you an engine.  World-class absurdity, methinks.  On the positive side, it
makes oil changes much easier.  If they are easier, you will do them  more
often.
That is world-class good sense, methinks.  I have one on my truck as well as my
small P-car stable.  They work real well.
