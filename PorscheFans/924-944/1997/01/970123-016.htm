	Karl,

	During the summer, someone took a poll of everyone who had 
	replaced their pump to get a consensus of which was the best
	way to go. As I remember, there was no consensus. Rebuilts seemed
	to last as long as new parts, in most cases. There were a few
	cases though of some shoddy rebuilts failing in something like
	8000 miles so if you go that route, be sure you get a quality
	rebuild. I wouldn't want to do this job again in only 8000
	miles if I were you...

Good luck!
