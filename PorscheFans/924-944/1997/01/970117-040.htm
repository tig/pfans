Sure.  It'll pay off in the long run for you to get as familiar with your car
as possible.

Well, that's up to you.  If you drive the car now, you should probably take the
time to at least check where the car is leaking from.  You don't want to lose
your pump on the road.

I've been slowly changing my timing/balance shaft belts.  It has been averaging
close to 0, and I have no heat in the garage (and it is not connected to the
dang house).  Generally if I bundle up enough, I can generate enough heat
working on the car to not be completely miserable...

Factory tech. manuals.  Or the Haynes manual.  I currently don't have the
Factory manuals (I wish I did), so I depend on the collective resource of the
list.  The listmembers seem to put up with farely well...

Probably a good weekend.  Providing you have the right tools.  George B.  has a
pretty good guide replacing the water pump.  You might want to ask him for a
copy.  Some of the porsche web sites also have a copy of it.

Have fun!
