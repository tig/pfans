Starts to pull away from an S2 after 5000 rpm in 2nd gear and thereon. The
P31 (M030 equivalent) option has better brakes (cross-drilled). 6 speed
gearbox is better on the track from 3rd to 6th gear than a S2. Quality
control and finish on a 968 is better than a 944 supposedly because they
were made in Zufenhasen (sp?) vs. Neckarsulm for the 944 (sub-contracted
out to Audi). 236hp vs. 208hp and 225lb-ft vs. 207lb-ft of torque. I
prefer the S2 styling but a blk. 968 is nice, also more unique looking.

On the street you will prefer the low-end torque and no turbo lag of the
968 hands down. On the track the 968 will be faster too. Unless you plan
to spend money on the turbo for chip and turbo mods, etc. Engine longevity
should be better for the 968. I'm curious what the prices are for these 2
Porsches? IMHO for what you want to do with it, go 968. It should also
retain better resale value. When I trade up, I'll be looking for a 968.
Lemme no what you decide on. Also would be interesting to see a summary of
responses you get. TIA
