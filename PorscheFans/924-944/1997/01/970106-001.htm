In a recent Excellence article about a 944 Turbo developed for track use, the 
author referred to a design shortcoming in the 944/951 crankshaft as being the 
primary (sole?) cause of the #2 rod bearing failure problem that has been often 
discussed in many Porsche technical circles.  Apparently, according to the 
article, this has been a problem for 928's as well.

Meanwhile, I heard from a buddy who is an "air-cooled guy," that he heard this 
same thing as well.  He indicated that according to his unnamed source, some 
careful experimental work was done that confirms the design flaw of the crank.

I read just about everything I can about these cars, and have talked to many of 
the experts.  This is the first time I've heard of this.  I generally recall 
that there was a Pano note from Charlesworth (PCA 944/951 Tech Chair) et al, 
that suggested that they are still trying to put all of the pieces together on 
this topic, and a summary would be forthcoming soon.

I am likely to drop my oil pan soon to replace the gasket, rod bearings and 
install some baffling/oil pan mods.  I'd sure like to know if this crank deal 
is valid!

Does anyone out there know more about this?  Is this just a rumor?  How about 
hearing from Pasha, Milledge or other experts?

This is perhaps the most important engine-related topic to those running their 
cars on the track.
