David, I'm 6'-4" tall, and, after driving a dealer's demo 944 for an afternoon, 
despaired of ever finding a comfortable water-pumper.  As they are normally equipped 
(sunroof and electric seats/windows), 944s are very tight on head-room, 
knee-room, and elbow-room for us tall guys.  However...the story is different for the 
924S.  I found one (the 1988 limited edition Club Sport...500 made) that has no 
sunroof (adequate headroom), manual-adjustment seats (good knee-room), and 
manual window-winders (more elbow-room).  As a bonus, it also has the M030 
suspension, weighs less, and has an attractice grey with maroon pinstripe interior.  
After driving it for 9 years, I'm still satisfied.

Incidentally, the new Boxster fits me about as well as the 924S...plenty of headroom 
with the top up, adequate leg-room, and more than enough knee-room under the wheel 
when it's extended.  Neither matches my 356SC for roominess, though!
