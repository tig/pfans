Basically I describe my ventures into removing everything to check the water
pump.  So if your not interested, don't bother reading.

The only question I have is that my water-pump seems to be leaking.  It is not
leaking from the pulley at all, but either around the hoses or some where else.
 Is it possible for the pump to leak from where it is attached to the engine?
thanks

(long)

Well, this weekend I got underway to removing my timing belt and back cover.  I
wanted to see where my car was "leaking."  I think I've found the noisy pulley.
 The balance shaft tensioner doesn't appear to have any grease in it.  It is
no-where near as smooth as the other rollers, and has some lateral play.  I
don't know why it doesn't have as much grease as the others.  The
rollers/tensioners were changed last summer.  The tensioner also makes a lot of
noise when spun.

I found out my balance shafts were not oriented properly (on the marks).

My rear belt cover has a lot of cracks in it and is broken in some areas.  I
found out why.  Removing the thing is just about impossible with all the
water/oil hoses in place.  I succeeded in getting it out, in two pieces :(.  I
guess I'm going to be ordering another one...Oh well, there are worse things I
could break.

Now my water pump.  I've had some sort of leak, and I've been trying to figure
out what it is.  It appeared to be oil from my cam-shaft oil seal, I replaced
the seal.

Anyway, I think my oil pump is leaking.  The leakage runs down the side of the
water pump onto the funney hose.  It is not leaking a lot, simply a little.  I
can't tell if it is leaking anti-freeze or oil (is it possible?).  There is
definitely oil on the underside of the funny hose.  There is definitely lots of
water (but maybe not anti-freeze) all over the pump (except where the pulley
is).  The thing is, the water is probably condensation do to the wet/cold/snowy
weather we've been having.

Is it possible for the water pump to leak from around the engine?  I'm not
leakinf from the pulley attached to the pump.  The hoses look okay, however
there may be some seapage coming from around them.  I'll probably change them
soon.

The only place I'm leaking oil from is the corner of the cam-shaft, and then
there is only a drop of oil (looked like it got squeezed out).  The rest of the
engine looks clean.  I was worried about having leaks due to the 2.8L engine
with 9.0:1 compression and Stage II chips...
