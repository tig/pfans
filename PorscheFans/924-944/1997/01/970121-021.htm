Over the last several days, I have watched this thread with great
interest. I am considering entering the PCA Club Race arena.  I
currently own a '77 911 C2 Turbo Cab and am looking for a solid 911
roller to build as a track car (not having much luck finding a good
car).

I plan to build a 993 wide-body w/ Big Red brakes, coilover suspension,
3.6, G50, etc.

However, the 914/944 debate was way too rational and has caused me to
consider a 944 as a track car.  I am a beginning driver and would like a
car that will challenge me while I am learning.  Furthermore, I would
like to keep the 944 racing budget at a reasonable level.  Unless I
become a complete convert to 944 racing, I still plan to build the 911.
The way I look at it, the 944 allows me to start racing now, improve my
skills and spend my money developing the 911.  I do most of the work on
my cars which helps offset the cost.

Since I have only owned air-cooled Porsches, I am in need of much advise
if I am to go in this direction.  List of questions:

1.  What year/model 944 should I buy/avoid?
2.  What class should I target?
3.  What modifications (brakes, suspension, wheels/tires, engine, cage,
seats, etc.) can/should I make (as much detail as possible so that I can
start a shopping list while looking for a car)?
4.  Anyone have a car for sale in the Atlanta, GA area?
5.  Anyone have shop manuals for sale?
6.  Advise?

Thanks in advance (all comments/suggestions/flames welcome)
