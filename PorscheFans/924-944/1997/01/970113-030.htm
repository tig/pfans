If you pulled the bracket instead of the sensors, you simply can't make that
mistake, for the adjustment just isn't that sensitive.  Also, I think if the
flywheel were caressing them 
1) the engine would get real quiet, real fast, i.e., quit   and  2) it would
not last through more than the first "click".  

'Taint impossible, of course, and I could be wrong.   After all, I am a
victim of your words,
just trying to get through a Montana winter (it was -31 F last night) while
you are wherever you are.  But experience says that 944s that sit for a
while tend to be lazy
about re-oiling their lifters.....

Only a couple inches.  But it's real good quality stuff.
