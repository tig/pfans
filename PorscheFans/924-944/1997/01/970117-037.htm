I have a recently purchased '87 951 w/ 30K miles.  The plan, when I bought
it, was to have the timing belt replaced.  Never been done before.  I hadn't
decided whether to do or have done.  4-500 bucks for tensioning tool was
tipping the scales toward having it done.  Last night I noticed a small spot
of fluid under the car.  You guessed it!  Green and sweet smelling.  Even saw
a small drip on the underpan.  Now I'm really leaning toward having the work
done.  My garage space is limited, heat (in the garage) is limited, and my
time is limited.

Questions:
If I take it in for the belts, and the leak is not the H2o pump, have it
changed anyhow?

Take the time to remove the underpan and peripherals to see what's leaking
before taking in for service?

Wait till spring for the garage space and heat to problems to rectify?

I know there are complete instructions SOMEWHERE as to what's involved in
both procedures.  Anybody know where?

I know the flat rate is about 3 hrs on t-belt and 3 more on h2o pump.  What's
it take a shadetree mechanic his first time through the process?

TIA,
Jeff
