I'd like to know exactly WHAT did the mechanic put in the trans?  I have
not heard of anyone using Teflon in a manual transmission because you
actually WANT some friction to enhance the action of the syncros.  This
may work fine in cold weather, but you might have a problem with gear
clash when it warms up.

Synthetic manual transmission fluids such as Redline MTL flow very well =
at
cold temperatures, but they contain friction modifiers to enhance
shifting.  I have it in a couple of my cars and it works great.  For =
$7.99
a quart, two quarts is a lot cheaper than $100, if you do it yourself.
