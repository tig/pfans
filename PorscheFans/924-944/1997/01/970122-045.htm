Hey Bob,
	I bought a 1997 951 as an emotional buy and had a real tough time
trying to diagnose the problem.  I went to four mechanics that said that
they were Porsche experts, but no one could fix my starting problem. 
Until I moved to VA and I found a great shop.
	My 951 would intermittantly start.  It would always turn, but never
"kick in" reliably.  I changed the DME relay, then the fuel pump, and
then the fuel line.  Because it was am abused car, by its owners, and
more from the people that tried to fix it, I kept following "red
herrings" until I moved to VA and found out that it was corroded
contacts from the reference controller.  The car starts every time, but
unfortunately I know I have to regularly clean the contacts or the car
will not kick in.  The guy that diagnosed the problem thought is was no
big deal and charged me only a couple of bucks, literally, to fix this
problem.
	Good luck
		Thom
