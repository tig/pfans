I own a 1987 944S with 146000 miles on it and in the last year have had
difficulty in
shifting into second gear, especially when the car is cold. The shifts are
better when the car is warmed up, but there is still some resistance in the
shift from first to second gear on the  upshift. Downshifts into second are
also difficult unless the rate of car speed is very low. I suspect the
syncronizers in the tranny. I have faithfully changed the gear oil at about
every 30,000 to 40,000 miles and have even tried motor oil(10w30 synthetic)
for a while to see if the thinner oil would make a difference. What do you
PorscheFans think would be the best course of corrective action for this
problem? Replace syncros in my tranny? Rebuild the entire transmission?
Replace the transmission with a rebuilt one and turn mine in for the
"core".Any idea of what the cost would be? I am a fair "shadetree" mechanic.
How about the difficulty of removing the transmission myself and installing
someone else's rebuilt one?
