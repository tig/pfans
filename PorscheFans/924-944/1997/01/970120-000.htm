There have been a number of postings on clutch bleeding and I would 
like to throw in my fl 0.02 (dutch currency). I recently had to 
replace the slave cylinder on my 1985 924S and after bleeding it 
three times it still didn't feel solid (I hadn't raised the rear of 
the car because of space and tool limitations). It disengaged about 
halfway through the stroke so at least I could drive it. I planned to 
take it to a shop and have them bleed it (yet again). However after 
driving a couple of km's the problem solved itself, through the 
vibration and frequent use of the clutch the remaining air probably 
travelled up through the plumbing and the master cylinder and all is 
well now.

I can pick up a damaged 944S2 cab for a good price, the car is beyond 
repair but the mechanicals and interior are still good. Is it 
possible to put the entire drive train (engine, driveshaft, transaxle)
in my 924S (I still prefer the 924 body over the 944 style). I would 
also like to transplant the interior. The steering wheel is higher on 
an S2 (which is something I like as I am 1.9 m) but will the steering 
column of an S2 (and dashboard) fit my 924S.

I guess a 924S with 211 hp should do over 250 km/h. (and I live 
close to Germany :-)).

TIA

Paul
