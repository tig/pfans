Hi fellow waterpumpers
This is my first posting to you, so please be gentle with me if I seem a
little shy or reserved (I'm relatively new to the internet altogether).
I'm looking for a replacement windshield for my 1988 944 Turbo S (one of
the original limited edition models).  It's not a concours vehicle, but
instead, one that I use in summertime as a weekender, for rallyes,
autocrosses, and hi-speed lapping (primarily instructing at Road America
and Blackhawk Farms).  While at Parade last fall in Oklahoma, I was
changing out the hood support struts and made the mistake of raising the
hood a little too much, which caused the corner of the hood to impact the
windshield on the passenger side at the lower edge of the glass.  I now
have a series of horizontal cracks extending about 12-15 inches towards the
center, so I'll have to replace it before I do any serious driving this
spring.  Does anyone know of a relatively inexpensive source for this item.
I need the type with the built-in antenna wire, since I don't particularly
wish to drill a hole in the fender to install a separate antenna.  I will
also pass along a little hint to anyone else who is going to change their
hood struts - attach the hood end first, then compress the shock some, and
lower the hood a little to attach the frame end, that way you don't have to
raise the hood so much and take the chance of cracking the glass.  TIA for
any help you can give.
