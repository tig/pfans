The subject of transmissions and gear oil has been batted around, which
reminded me of a couple of failures that might be worth checking out.  On my
86 951 with LSD, the transmission oil cooler had failed twice.  Both  the
original and the replacement cooling lines fractured at the top of the rear
most loop.  These fractures were fatigue cracks that on the first split the
line in two and on the second, split it part way through.  The cracks were
impossible to detect because they occurred in the clamp that positions the
cooling coil.  The rubber vibration damper was in place and obscured the
cracks.  When this line breaks, all the oil is pumped out of the transmission
with some rather unpleasant results.  The first failure was as Bridgehampton
Race Curcuit and I was able to pull the car off the track in time to save the
transmission.  The other drivers were not happy with me dropping that much
oil on line, but such is life.  The second cooler line did not break, but
only cracked and the oil dribbled out over a couple of runs.  There was no
oil on the rear of the car, so I had no indication anything was wrong.  My
wife came in from her run and said the car was down on power, so I checked it
over, saw nothing obviously wrong and went out for a check run.  On the warm
up lap on the front straight of Watkins Glen, it popped out of gear and would
not go back into gear.  I pulled off and the transmission froze up.  All the
oil had slowly dribbled out and the trans had overheated.  The pinion gear
was a very pretty dark blue, and some of the syncros were bronze gravel in
the bottom of the case.  Needless to say, the entire trans was toast.

So those of you who have a 951 LSD trans, take a peak at the cooling lines
and make sure they are solid.  I now inspect them by removing the positioning
clamps and wiggling the line to make sure it is solid.  I also keep them
squeeky clean so that any leaks will immediately be obvious.

Happy New Year To All
