"Jay wrote questioning the longevitity of 400 hp from a 951"

Have to disagree, I saw the dyno printout from one such engine with 398 hp at
the flywheel.  For the stroked engines with K27s and all the tricked out mods,
400 hp is possible.  It translates to about 335 at the rear wheels.  Quite a few
of the West Coast top racers have engines that they race every week that are in
this range.

My builder has projected on his computer that my engine will be between 345 and
360 flywheel hp depending on the final setup.  This is with some bullet proofing
(slight detuning) being built in.  I know his program works because his big
block Chevy showed 825 hp on the computer and it actually dynoed out at only two
or three less hp.

You can crank a lot of horses out of the four holers if you feed them enough
money.
