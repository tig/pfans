"Darren Foo asked about the air/oil separator that was developed by Jon
Milledge"

As it was explained to me, the oil pump cavitated at high rpm like a boat prop.
The 944 oil pump turns at the same speed as the engine with a one to one ratio.
When the engine reaches the 6000 range the oil pump starts cavitating, sucks air
and looses a portion of its pumping ability.  Milledge has an external device
that separates the air and oil and lets the pump do its job.  He indicates you
should have an external oil cooler to hook up his separator to.  His price for
the kit is $460.  When we get it in, I'll let you know what it looks like.

On the Accusump discussion, my engine builder just returned from the auto parts
show in Reno with some info about this.  He talked to several go-fast engine
parts manufacturers and learned that the accumulator should be as close to the
engine as possible.  The NASCAR boys smoked some big buck engines with the
accumulator in the trunk.   They subsequently determined that due to the
viscosity of the oil, it could not flow  fast enough through a long connecting
line to keep the oil pressure up when the oil pickup sucked air.  The oil
pressure gauge would drop to zero and the accumulator gauge would still show 60
lbs.

To solve the problem they went to a lighter weight oil and moved the accumulator
under the hood.
