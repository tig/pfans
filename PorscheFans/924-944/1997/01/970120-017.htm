Most of the time it is the same part, but just doesn't come in one of those
expensive Porsche boxes.   Porsche doesn't make many of their own
parts, but farms them out.   US wholesalers, being rocket scientists to
a man, deduced that it would be cheaper to buy the same pistons from
Mahle, for example, pass along the savings to their customers, and (most
importantly) still make their 100% markup.    For a part to be labeled OEM
is has to be manufactured by the same company that made it for the 
Porsche assembly line.  I suppose they could sell you factory seconds,
but I would generally expect the very same level of quality.  If this were not
the case, the ever-discrimminating Porsche owner community would put
the aftermarket out of business, and as a shop owner, I would not do
business with them.

Every one of the aftermarketeers knows what the dealership prices are, 
and they know what they pay.  That knowledge defines the price range in
which they normally sell their products.   Some of them even sell at prices
HIGHER than the dealerships, because those parts are only available 
from the dealerships, and the aftermarketeers feel they have to make at
least some minimum profit on everything they sell.  To duck the inevitable
flames, I will not name these guys.   They will tell you that it is simply for
the "convenience" of the customer -- one stop shopping and all that.

The aftermarket is currently being put in a hell of a squeeze lately, 
because of the PPE program put on by the dealers.   They are charging
RETAIL prices that are lower than the WHOLESALE prices most 
aftermarketeers pay.   E.g., a Sachs clutch disc that I could sell for $260
three months ago, now costs $140 through PPE.   These are all OEM/Genuine
parts.

Your best ally is becoming knowledgeable.  Hope this helps.

Dave
