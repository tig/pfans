In a message dated 97-01-10 19:31:12 EST, you write:

<< I just replaced the motor mounts today on my '87 944.  Took about 6 hours,
 no big problems, and now have much less vibration at idle.  The only
 problem was getting the control arms in the exact spot on the body; the
 instructions I was following indicated a "realignment" was necessary if you
 could not match it up.  They are off about 2-3mm from the scribe marks I
 made before disassembly.  Is this going to be a problem, should I get stuff
 aligned, or should I forget about it??
  >>
Sorry buy you are going to need an alignment. 2-3 MM is a significant amount.
It affects the toe more than anything and could make a big difference on tire
wear and handling characteristics. I'll bet that your steering wheel is no
longer perfectly centered, assuming it was before the operation.
Regards, 
Jerry
89 944T track car (with new motor mounts and just back from getting an
alignment)
