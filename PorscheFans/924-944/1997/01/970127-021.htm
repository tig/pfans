	Jeff, replace the belts anyway. Once they have water
	on them, they're toast. Your mechanic should know this.
	$550 seems *incredibly* low to me. When I had this
	job done in August, it was $925. Where is this *new*
	water pump coming from? What do your fellow region members
	think of the shop you take your car to?
