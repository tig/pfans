Hey there everyone,

Regarding:

My power steering unit was in need of servicing when I first got my car.  The
PO had neglected it long enough to require me to purchase a new (recon) power
steering pump which was not too expensive...    The  "other problems"
 however - as I just found out yesterday - 8 months later is that the leaking
fluid caused my swaybar bushings to rot away on that side of the engine
compartment.  Hence I feel it is a good idea to fix the problem as soon as it
is detected - A tell-tale sign of mine was the loud groaning noise the
steering made on cold days! - the leaking fluid was subtle enough be non
visible at first.
