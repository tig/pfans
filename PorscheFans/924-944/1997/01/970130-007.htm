Clark,

If you are planning this, you must have some idea of what 
you are doing.   It's a bit more complex than your average
Chevy 350, but nothing that an attentive mechanic can't get
right.

You have to have two special tools:   The infamous P9201
for the balance shaft (I believe you have the self=tensioner
for the timing belt), and the oil pressure relief valve centering
tool for the oil cooler.   Also, a spanner to hold the balance
shafts while tightening is useful but may be worked around.

Normal principles of cleanliness and torqueing apply.   Pay
utterly close attention to cam timing matters.

At 100 bucks for a rebuilt pump, go for it.   Replace all oil seals
on the front of the engine, including camshaft, balance shafts,
and main.

Enjoy.

Dave
