It sounds like your warmup regulator is not functioning.   Pull the plug and
check for battery voltage.   If not present, replace the appropriate relay.  
The low idle indicates that the auxiliary air valve is also not working.   Same
relay, same test.

Sounds like old injectors fouled with old fuel.   Pull them and check the
spray pattern.   You are looking for a clean fog , not little streams like from
a squirt gun.   Be sure to replace the O-rings.

Do you get this reading at the battery?   Sounds like an alternator headed
south.
You should get a steady 14.5 volts from a fresh alternator.   Any more and
you will
eventually cook the battery.   Any less and you will chronically undercharge 
(something I wish my parts suppliers would do.

Overall, you are having the typical experience of taking any CIS car out of
storage.   Just a little more work to do.

Best of luck.
