To all Porsches regarding Fuel Tank Vapor smells in the 944, read this:

I have a 944, 1983 with 230,000 miles on her.  The car had no major overhauls
except main engine bearings, and 3 water pumps.

I had a gas smell.  Happened only when tank was full.  It was from a small
crack on top of the tank.  I think it was fixed and happened again.  Till I
found the REAL problem.  Wonder if Porsche knows this?

The gas rushing sound you hear when you unscrew the fuel tank cap is
pressurized air designed into the emission system.  There is a small,
pressure controlled, one-way valve located in the tunnel that houses the fuel
filler pipe and other hoses.  It is accessable within the car, in the hatch
area under the fuel filler cap.  This valve is supposed to keep pressure on
the system allowing no vapors to leave the fuel tank.  At some time in
pressure (i think) the valve opens and the gas vapors flow into the charcoal
cannister near the radio antenna.

Trouble was, in my car, the stupid valve kept BLOWING UP MY TANK, by cracking
the metal from the expanding and contracting of the fuel tank.  The tank
expands from the TOO HIGH PRESSURE CAUSED BY THAT $2 valve, and then when you
open the fuel cap, the whoosing sound is the air rushing out and collapsing
the tank.  Eventually the stiff metal becomes cracked!

I guess the valve could get stuck too, but I took no chances.  I DESTROYED
the valve by putting a nail through the diaphram and voila, no more
pressurized gas tank, no more whoosing at the gas station, (More than once a
gas attendant jumped away from my beauty while opening the gas tank cap
because of the whoosing.  Always funny), and no more cracked gas tank.

So I vote to get rid of the valve, and drive with no more gas vaopor
problems, just the smell of leather.  Except when the rains didnt stop
(another story, another fix).

The valve is small size like a 1/2 a thumb, and is clear or translucent cream
colored.  When you blow into it air goes one way and not the other.

Ill tell you, I absolutely love this car.  God help me.
