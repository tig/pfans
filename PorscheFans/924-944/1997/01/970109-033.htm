Hello Argeo,

  I bought an '84 944 (non-turbo) last December. It also is in 'mint'
condition (interior and exterior). The problem areas on mine were a
'clunking' clutch, power steering leaks, oil leaks. Minor annoyances with
fuses and some interior/plastic parts broken or missing.

The dealer listed the car at $5995 but put on sale for $3995. I paid it
with the stipulation they fix the clutch and repair all leaks. They came
back and wanted an additional $600 ($1200 job but they'd split the cost). I
countered with a $600 discount and I fix everything. They went for it, I
drove it home.

I visited Kelley's Blue Book site ( http://www.kbb.com ) and calculated
$3400 as low blue book value for this car. I recommend you visit there.

Additional notes: I have about $850 in a new clutch, oil cooler leak fix,
new power steering hoses and hood struts. I expect another $500 in new
timing belts / rollers and remaining oil leaks in balance shaft cover. This
brings the value to just above High book value.

Hope this provides some useful information. The items I had to repair seem
to be common to the 944. Fortunately CV joints are OK and no water in oil
problems yet.

Regards, Doug
'84 944
