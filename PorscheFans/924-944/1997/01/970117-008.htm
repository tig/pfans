WARNING - the following impressions of a Boxster test drive eat up some
serious bandwidth.  If you=92re not very interested in my driving impress=
ions,
page down now!  If you=92ve read everything you can get your hands on, an=
d
wanna know how it drives - hang on!

I drove a Boxster today - WOW!  The car is really better looking in reali=
ty
than all the pics we=92ve all seen.  I know everyone has the same comment=
s at
first view, but there=92s a good reason for it - it=92s true.  The car re=
ally has
an agressive stance when viewed from the rear quarter.  This demo was gua=
rds
red/black.
When seated, I had more headroom than either my 911 or 951.  The overall
impression is that of a smaller car, but the headroom, shoulder and legro=
om
are ample.  I typically have headroom clearance problems at 6 feet tall (=
and
short legs).  The telescoping wheel is nice, as I needed to pull it up an=
d
toward me to give my left knee clearance from the steering wheel while
shifting.  I found myself shifting a lot - just because it felt so good!
 Nice positioning of the shifter, more like a 944 than 911-but crisper.
 Overall, the interior is nicely designed and quite comfortable for a
roadster.

Turn the key (on the left where it=92s supposed to be) and it purrs.
 Incredibly smooth idle, and it doesn=92t change through 6,500rpm.  As sm=
ooth
and vibration-free an engine as I=92ve driven. Snap it in first, ease out=
 the
clutch and off we went.  Sounded great - quiet up to 2,500-3,000, then it
growls up to about 4,000 rpms, snarls up to 5,000 and flat out screams ab=
ove
that.  It=92s ever so sweet!  Sounds more like an air-cooled boxer than a
Porsche water-pumper.

The feel of the engine is different than any Porsche I=92ve owned or driv=
en.
 Of all the Porsche=92s, it=92s probably closest to the 944S (quattrovolv=
e).  The
torque curve feels very flat.  I=92ve not seen any specs on the engine.  =
All I
know is 201 hp, so my impressions come by way of the seat of my pants.  N=
o
pre-disposition as to how it=92s supposed to feel.  At any rate, although=
 I=92d
call the torque flat, it=92s not a =93torquey=94 engine, like the 968.  I=
t also
doesn=92t have that high-rpm surge that puts you back to the seat and a s=
mile
on your face.  You know that feeling you get from an early =93S=94 model =
at about
5,000 rpms, when the cams do their magic and it squats and goes =93whoosh=
=94 and
it feels so good you wish it redlined at 8,000 instead of 7,000 (o.k. 6,7=
50),
yeah, you know what I mean.  Well...this engine doesn=92t do that.  It=92=
s more
like. . . I=92d call it spirited.  Yeah tha=92s it!

Handling?  YES!!!  One Porsche I haven=92t driven is a 914, but I bet a b=
lind
man could be tricked into thinking a Boxster is a 914 - 6 with 200 hp!  I=
t=92s
on rails, and my ride had the factory rubber on 16=94 wheels.  I can only
imaging 17 or 18=92s.

I was quite surprised/impressed w/ the amount of storage in font and rear=
..  A
lot more than a 911, and a =93travel friendlier=94 layout.  I was also im=
pressed
with the solid feel (typical Porsche), and the top was surprisingly well
insulated.
They also had a Glacier white Boxster in the detailing area, just taken o=
ff
the truck.  It had the hardtop on, and it looked like a different car!
 Almost had a Ferrari look to it!?!

Only regret - it=92s not going in my garage!
