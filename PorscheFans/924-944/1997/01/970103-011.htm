Sounds like you have a leaking battery tray...This is a common problem,
caused by the battery slowly leaking acid onto the battery tray (under the
hood, just above the passenger footwell), which will eventually rust
completely through.  When it rains, it can cause a lake to form in the
front & rear passenger footwells.  The best fix is to get a new piece of
sheetmetal welded in, but you can get away with fiberglassing it for a
while.  However, fiberglass will usually start leaking again after a while.
