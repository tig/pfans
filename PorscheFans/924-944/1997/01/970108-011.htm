I've been having a few problems with my 77 924.  First, it seems to idle OK
when cold but once it warms up it idles way too high (1800 RPM).  I'm
guessing it is the warm up regulator.  Also once it is warm the oil
pressure seems to go much lower.  My guess there, rod bearings.  Speaking
of warming up, when I am in stop & go traffic it really warms up.  It does
great on the freeway but gets a tad warm on city streets.

That out of the way, I noticed the '77 1/2 924's have more horses with what
appears to be the same engine.  The only difference in specs is the
compression ratio.  How can I bring my 77 to the same specs?  Is there any
other way to squeeze a few more horses out other than selling my baby and
getting a 944.  I bought the "poorman's" Porsche for a reason, I'm not rich
enough to get anything more.  Thanks for any help that can be offered.  I'm
sure I'll have more questions.

Walt
