My next plan of attack for my car (1985.5 944) is the motor mounts, I
think.  It shakes like an overloaded washing machine at idle and
immediately clears up once the motor gets to 1500 rpm.  It also makes a
loud clunk when you turn it off and it winds down.  It sounds like the
motor mounts.  My questions are:
1. How involved is this process, and is their any shortcuts to make it
go faster (time wise)?
2. Is their a specific motor mount that is better.  I think I heard
something about a Turbo mount but I do not recall at this time.
3.  Where would the cheapest place to buy the offending parts?
Thanks so much for all your help in the past, present, and future.

Jason,

I just finished doing this two weeks ago. It wasn't as bad as I thought. =
There was a=20
post here last year with a pretty good procedure. I have added it below (=
sorry for the=20
large file everyone). I also relied a little on the Haynes procedure. The=
 best price I=20
found was at the Porsche dealer - They matched Vasek Polaks $90.60 price =
with $96 -  and=20
I could have them immediately.

Expect to get dirty. My right side mount was full of oil. Also - make sur=
e you have a=20
crowbar or something to enable you to move the crossbar around. I was abl=
e to re-install=20
the crossbar back to it's original position and don't seem to need an ali=
gnment.

Took me 6 hours - no breaks.

Good Luck!

Guide to 944 Motor Mount replacement

This is a straight forward mechanical job that doesn=92t require any spec=
ial
gauges, tool, etc. but it is far from easy. I did it in a day without a l=
ift
or a helper, both of which would be beneficial. It does require patience,=
 a
reasonable amount of skill and some more patience.
I am sure there are other ways to do this but I=92ll relate how I did it
successfully on two different cars. Feel free to read a manual or use a
different  sequence. I did this on an 89 Turbo so there may be some
differences in your car.

1.  Get the right parts. The newest mounts are #951 375 042 04. I paid $1=
60
for two. Usually the left mount will be OK but replace it anyway since yo=
u
really don=92t want to do this job twice. You also need 4 bolts. Size 8mm=
 x
40mm. Interestingly enough Porsche now packages two mounts to a box. Draw
your own conclusions
2.  Get the car up on jack stands as high as possible and make sure that =
you
did a good job of this. It=92s going to ruin your day if the car falls of=
f the
stands.
3.  Take off the front wheels. (you did loosen them before you jacked it =
up?)
4.  Remove the belly pan and put all the little nuts, bolt and screws in =
a
container.
5.  Remove the front sway bar. Unbolt it from the control arm and the fra=
me
and set it aside. It gets in the way of everything.
6.  Remove the sheet metal heat shields that block access to the motor
mounts. (like they did any good in the first place) 10mm bolts here.
7.  Remove both the lower motor mount nuts. One on each side where the mo=
unt
goes through the crossmember. This is 17mm and requires an open end wrenc=
h
and patience.
8.  Remove the upper motor mount bolts. They are difficult to reach
(especially the front one) and you again will need patience and two 13mm
wrenches. They were particularly difficult in my car since the nuts were
imbedded in the collapsed motor mount, which is rubber. When you get thes=
e
bolts loose discard them so you don=92t mistakenly reuse them as they are=
 too
long for the new mounts. Save the thick washers.
9.  At this point you need to support the engine. Get a board and use it =
to
distribute the force when you jack up the engine on the oil pan. Jack it =
up
until the tension is taken off the motor mounts. Be very careful you don=92=
t
jack the front of the car off the jack stands.
10.  Take a sharp instrument and make a scribe mark around the rear of th=
e
control arm where two bolts hold it to the chassis. If you do this you *m=
ay*
avoid a realignment when you are finished.
11.   Unbolt the crossmember from the chassis. There are two 19mm bolts i=
n
the front and the two aforementioned bolts at the rear of the control arm
(17mm). The whole crossmember should now drop down.
12.   Remove the old mounts ( you will have to twist them around a bit) b=
ut
be sure and note their orientation. There is a stud that indexes in the
crossmember and you can put these on improperly. It is a struggle to get
these out and a struggle to get the new ones in. Make sure the rubber "ea=
r"
of the new mount is tucked into the side of the crossmember and the
projection on the bottom of the new mount corresponds to the stud on the =
old
ones. It will be obvious how this works if you compare the old to the new.
13.  You are now ready to put everything back together. This is probably =
the
hardest part of the job because the engine bosses and the new mounts have=
 to
line up or you won=92t be able to able to start the NEW 8 x 40 bolts that=
 hold
the mounts to the engine bosses. These bolts go through the engine bosses=
 and
into the mounts. Be sure and use one of the old, thick,  washers with the=
se
bolts. I had to bolt the crossmember back on to the frame lightly and rai=
se
and lower the engine a number of times until I got all four bolts started=
.. I
also had to horse the crossmember around a number of times to achieve thi=
s.
Be patient and don=92t cross thread those bolts. They must start cleanly =
or
everything is not lined up. You are now home free when this happens.
14.  When you bolt everything back together, if you are very lucky, you w=
ill
be able to bolt the rear control arm bolts back up and have the control a=
rm
line up with those scribe marks. If you can=92t achieve this (on one car =
I did
and the other I couldn=92t ) you won=92t need to re align the car. You ca=
n move
the crossmember around to a certain extent but it still isn=92t easy to g=
et
those damn marks to align.
15.  Replace everything that you removed and tighten all bolts to spec. I
don=92t remember the torque specs of the various chassis bolts since I do=
n=92t
have a manual handy. Maybe someone can supply these torque figures.
16.  Start the engine and be amazed at the difference!!
