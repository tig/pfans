Hello to the group.  If Everyone remembers a while back I posted that I
had just bought a 85.5 944 with very loud collision problems while the
motor was running.  Well I took it all apart, found the cam had slipped
1 tooth and polished the piston tops.  The slippage seems to have been
due to an improperly tensioned belt from the previous rebuild which
judging from lack of carbon and incredibly good shape of the cylinders
was performed very recently.  Upon further disassembly of the head I
found some post factory stampings looking like someone's initials and
7-95 which I hope means July of 95. Anyway I just did the valve job and
we are good there.  My problem (and Questions) now concerns the camshaft
assembly.
1. Does anyone know the size, designation for the bolt that threads into
the front on the camshaft at the center of the sprocket.  It looks like
a 16 point allen head.
2. Is the large nut that holds the sprocket on left or right hand
thread?  I don't want to go Blazing away with the impact in the wrong
direction. 
3.  Can anyone give the headbolt torque for my year? (85.5) It seems for
every aspect of this rebuild the manual (haynes) has been useless.  It
just says see Porsche Dealership. It is a Fel-pro gasket if it matters.

4.  Can anyone give me any reccomendations for belt tension?  I found a
guy local who has the tool.  (thank God)

5.  Does anyone know what it costs to have the antennae front windshield
replaced (rough estimate)
Thanks very much in advance for any pointers and advice you can offer.

P.S. To all those who had Emailed me about my other parts car, thank you
for the interest.  I am sorry I have not responded to all of you.  Later
in the month when I get this car together and will be parking it outside
for a bit, I will then have room in my garage to pull the other one in
and dismantle it for parts.  If anyone is interested still, please Email
at the END of the month.
