==================================
So who is Lisle and how do I get a hold of them?   Also I'm in the market
for a air impact wrench but am confused as to what power range I need
for P-car work.  Is more power best or is too much just going to snap
off everything I try to use it on.  Some say they are adjustable or are   
all
adjustable by varying the air pressure?  Any help would be appreciated
since I've never used one.
Thanks
