I own a 1986 944 Turbo that I bought with 71K miles.  Shortly after buying
the car I began experiencing problems with the turbo boosting.  It will
happen randomly and always at a bad time.  The problem consists of the
turbo only boosting to 1.2 bar rather than the usual 1.8 bar.  This becomes
extremely annoying while trying to pass on a country road.  The problem
cures itself when the engine is shut off and immediatly started again.  I
have tried shuting it down and starting several times while coasting into
toll booths and I have never had a problem after the restart.  About seven
months ago I took the car to a Porsche Dealer.  The mechanics worked on the
car for two hours, which included a few calls to other dealerships.
Unfortunatly, they could not find the problem.  I am hoping that someone
else has experienced this problem and can help.

Thanks,

Jeff
