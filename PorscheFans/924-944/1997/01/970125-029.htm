Thanks all for your queries regarding the modifications to my 924 Turbo =
to run it at Carerra GT-S level, I responded to the first dozen queries =
and ran out of time for the rest. I will log some thoughts on this board =
when work is a little quieter (will also be putting details on my home =
page when I build it in March). 

Unfortunately I have had no answers to my queries on my overheating =
problems, so I'll pump in a bit more background info. My ex-girlfriend =
crashed my car in May last year, missed the brake pedal and rear ended a =
thing in Australia known as a Holden Commodore. The car itself stood up =
remarkably well, although there was a lot of broken fibreglass lying =
around the streets of Geelong. The only mecahnical damage was from where =
the Commodore's exhaust pipe poked through and holed the radiator. 

After battle the insurance company for six months (any Aussies want to =
know who they are just e-mail me privately and you can avoid them) they =
finally conceded and repaired the car to my high standards. My repairers =
have supposedly fixed the radiator, but it just doesn't seem to cool the =
car (bit warm in Melbourne at this time of the year, just preparing to go =
for a drive in 35 degree Celcius heat). If I drive to work it is boiling =
by the time I hit the car park, hence the enjoyment of my car is =
becomming very limited.

My initial question was if the thermo fan ran at two speeds, cos mine =
seems to only run very slow. And if there were any other thoughts before =
I take the car back to the repair shop. 

PS, never really wanted to own a Porsche, bit put of the yuppie =
advertising image, but am now truly in love with the front engined ones. =
Nothing, however, will change my mind about the rear engines ones... just =
as the well the Boxtser is mid-engined.
