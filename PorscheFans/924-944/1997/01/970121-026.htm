<< With regards to the normaly aspirated 944,  can anybody tell me if any 
 particular brake system upgrade is worthwhile (i.e. cross drilled 
 rotors, cooling ducts, pad compounds, stainless lines, etc.). 
 I would appreciate any comments from your experience. My application is 
 street and track. >>

I use my 85.5 for street and track and have been very pleased with Cool
Carbons
for both applications.  They wear more quickly and dust more than street
pads,
so you may want to switch back and forth. 

I fabricated my own cooling ducts, with very good results. I also added
braided stainless steel brake lines --the ones that are DOT approved. The
biggest benefit there is probably piece-of-mind, compared to 12 year old
rubber lines.

You'll want to get a good high-boiling-point brake fluid (I like ATE Super
Blue, but there are others) and change it often.  If your car is older, a
caliper rebuild wouldn't hurt.

I've been very pleased with the results of these simple -and relatively
inexpensive--
modifications.  When you're ready to play around a little more, I'd recommend
lowering the rear end (if it hasn't been done already) to take most of the
rake
out of the ride height and adding stiffer front springs.  Both will reduce
nose dive
and minimize rear lock-up.

I've read and heard a lot about cross-drilling; most of it negative.  First,
there
seems to be a misconception about it's purpose. Cross-drilling isn't done to
aid
cooling; it allows the gasses given off by brake pads as they vaporize under
extreme heat to escape from under the pads. The consensus seems to be that,
for this type of application,  there isn't enough of a problem with gassing
of the pads to justify the lost swept area. (On a pure race car, they just
make the rotors bigger to
make up for it!)  To the extent that off-gassing may be a problem, many seem
to feel that radial grooves are a better solution anyway.  However, I know
a lot of people who've had problems with warping with aftermarket rotors. 
My experience is consistent with what I read in a Pano article a few months
ago -- you can't do much better than Porsche OEM  rotors.

Good Luck,
Kevin B
