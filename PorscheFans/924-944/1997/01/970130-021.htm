Achtung!   (...impressed with my German, eh?)
   First of all, thanks for all of your suggestions re: the headlight
problem.
   Today, I have two quick questions. It's cold as hell here in NYC now, but
the shifting on my '86 944 (non-turbo) is definatley a bit easier after the
car is nice and warm. Is this normal. My Porsche guy at a place in Jersey
that I take it to repairs (BODY MOTION) says to NEVER force a shift, because
of the posibility of screwing up the trans. 
    And since he refuses to answer any questions about after-market
additives, what can anyone tell me about PROLONG. I thought it would make
sense for me because the car only has 30K on it. It's a weekend ride only.
Therefore, when I start it, I know the oil is ALL just hanging out in the
pan. Am I a victim of slick marketing or can this additive actually coat the
walls, keeping the wear and tear of starts down?
    Sorry, my questions are not more technical...Hey, the car only has 30K,
hopefully I won't have any questions like those for a while. (Yep, the timing
belt was done..)
Thanks again...
