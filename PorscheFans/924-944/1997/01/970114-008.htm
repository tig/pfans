I give it about 15 seconds to get oil to the various nooks and crannies
of the engine, then drive it gently until I start to feel heat coming out
of the 
defroster vents.

Very strange behavior. Does sound like a battery with a surface charge that
was
enough to start the car, but when idling did not get a recharge, and
eventually
drained the battery enough to let it die.

Yep, that's plausible enough... A good battery is cheap enough that you should
consider its replacement if it is three years old or older, even as a
diagnostic.

Batteries are black magic to me... They can hold a nice surface charge, enough
to start your car, but not have any depth of charge to them. I usually end up
replacing them after three years, just because the aggravation of a jumpstart
on a cold morning is not worth the extra twenty bucks I am saving...


Good Luck!
