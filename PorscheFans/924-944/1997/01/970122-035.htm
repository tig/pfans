	Crank it up and drive it away. Keep the revs under 4K
	until the temp. guage is out of the first white zone.

	I'll let someone else handle this one :)

Well hello again everybody,

It's been a while since I've had anything to say to the list, but I've
been reading and shall we say going to school.

I bought an 89 951 about a month ago.  Everything works, but it seemed
to me the clutch was a little stiff.  Today I got underneath the car
with the intention of bleeding the slave cylinder to rectify the
problem.  Once I got under there (where's the best place to put your
jack stands front and rear?) I discovered whoever checked out the clutch
through the peep hole last time neglected to put the little rubber plug
back in.

The clutch feels a thousand times better, having been bled.  However, I
am a bit concerned as to what damage could have been done to my
clutch/slave cylinder.  I get the feeling with the slave cylinder being
so close to the opening I am going to be looking at replacement soon,
but I don't have a good feel as to what effect this could have on the
clutch.

Anyone know a good place to get this plug?  Dover DE doesn't have a
Porsche dealer within an hours drive.

Sorry for the bandwidth...  any help would be much appreciated.
