Subj:    968 hatch sticking

I have had my dealership mechanic examine my 1992 968 hatch twice with no
success.  Any advice from list members would be helpful.

When I bought the car in December, I noticed that the right rear hatch pin
would make a graunching noise when the hatch opened.  The rubbing seemed to
come from the rectangular box on the underside of the hatch from which the
brass (?) pin projects downward.  There was an area of the box on the aft
edge where paint had actually worn off from rubbing.

The mechanic has adjusted this area twice and I have lubed it several times.
 The hatch sticks after a drive and requires 2 hands to open (one on the key,
one on the hatch).  If I open it, then it will open and close without
difficulty until I drive some more.  Any ideas or other adjustments?  The
hatch alignment looks good.
