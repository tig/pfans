a few feet of strong back cloth use by tailor for the perimeter of some 
robe or other clothes (sorry I don't even know the name in French so 
forget about the english name for that piece of strong black 3/8 inch 
wide flat cotton string).
I haven't done it yet but I intend to use two 6-8 inches long piece and 
use them as holder for the cover so it will not swing all the way down.
Sure it won't be as strong as the real thing but the cost is $2 not $100 
or $700.

Hope this helps
