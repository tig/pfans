This note is a series of lessons learned (the hard way, of course) and
a cry for information about how to fix them.  The car is an 1983 944.
Warning/apology: this is a long note--sorry 'bout that.

HATCH: Recently I noticed the rear hatch was leaking.  I suspected the
drain hoses, but they were fine.  Then I noticed that one of the bolts
which holds the latch assembly to the hatch was missing.  Apparently
the shop left it out a year ago when they replaced the glass.  Since,
in addition to the missing bolt, the latch pin itself seems to be
frozen (ie, won't turn for adjustment), I was thinking of replacing
the whole assembly.  Questions:

  What size and type of widgit does it take to loosen those bolts?
  Is there any reasonable way to unfreeze the latch pin?
  How hard is it to r&r the latch pin assembly?
  Is this likely to fix the water leak?
  
ALTERNATOR: While finishing up a recent repair job, I was quickly
tightening the polyrib belt tensioner and proceeded to overtighten it.
After I loosened it to the proper tension, the engine ran with (what
sounded like) belt squeal.  Turns out, it is probably the alternator.
The apparent damage includes a bent tensioner bolt (a/c side) and a
bent alternator shaft (I can see it wobble when I spin it by hand).
The charging system still seems to work (reads 14+V when engine runs),
but the battery did die about a month later.  Questions:

  Is the battery likely to be related or just a "bonus problem"?
  How much of the alternator do I realisticly have to replace (ie,
	shaft, shaft&bearings, whole thing)?
  Can the tensioner bolt be purchased by itself?
  What's a good source for these parts?

RADIATOR: In replacing the temp sensor, I overtightened it and cracked
the tank on the end of the radiator.  What's a good source for a
replacement rad?

ODOMETER: The odometer stopped working when I reset the trip counter
recently.  I know this is a common failure, and I have to remove the
odometer to replace or reposition a nylon gear.  Questions:

  Is the gear usually shot or just out of position?
  If the gear is shot, where can I get a new one?
  Is there any possibility of getting a metal gear to replace it?
  If it's out of position, should it be glued back in place or what?

GENERAL QUESTION: What is a 1983 944 with 68K miles, leather seats and
a good engine (minus the above problems) worth as a parts car?  (Gee,
I bet you can't imagine _why_ I'd be asking that :)

Thanks for your help!
