My '84 944 has the factory alarm, the one with the key-switch in the left
quarter panel. Recently I have opened the driver's side door a couple of
times without setting the alarm off. Alarm still works: when I crank the
ignition the alarm goes off and the engine is disabled, just the door
sensor seems to be erratic.

This is an older alarm, no motion sensors here. The alarm is supposed to
activate when a door, hatch, hood or roof is opened, or if the car is
started. I figured the sensor on the door would be a switch, and the
easiest thing to use would be the dome-light switch on the inside of the
left fender where the door hinges. Tried shorting this switch and it seems
to work fine.

I still can't figure out what triggers the alarm. The interior light comes
on at about the same time the alarm goes off when I try to open the door.
On the other hand when the alarm decides not to work and I open the door,
the interior light comes on and no alarm. All other switches in the
ignition, passenger door, hood, hatch and roof work fine. Anybody know
what triggers the alarm?
