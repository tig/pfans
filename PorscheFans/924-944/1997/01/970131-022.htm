Hey guys,

Like I said when I joined the list, I'll give out both good news and bad
news.  So, yesterday was the bad news, but today looks better.  The vibration
seems to have originated from the lower splash shields being torn to bits!

I guess when I hit the lake of water, it just tore the bottom lid off.
There was a lumber yard near by which may have caused wood to be present,
because the shop found what looks like wood chips all over the bottom of 
the exhaust system.  Fun stuff eh?  They are going to replace the undertray
with a new one, both were mangled and touching the exhaust.  Hopefully,
this will stop that new vibration that was felt.

I'll keep you informed of the progress.

Farzaan.
89 - 951 14psi and a bit wet right now!
