I had a '84 with the smell of gasoline inside, particularly after a fill
up.  The problem was deterioration of the rubber gas and vent lines located
on top of the fuel tank.  The fix was to drop the transaxle, followed by
the fuel tank to get at those lines.  Check everything else before doing
that.
