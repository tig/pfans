****Yep, I've had my 951 towed on a flat bed on at least two occasions.
This is the only way to do it.  There's a provision to attach a tow ring
(just remove the black plastic cap with two arrows on it above the front
license plate).  Most flatbed drivers have done this sort of thing before.
When I thought the back of the car would scrape the ground, I hollered
"Stop! Stop!" to the truck driver, but he gave me a funny look.  Turns out
there was enough clearance.  On a somewhat related thread, there's
something special about a flat bed tow.  People will gather and watch.  If
your car is towed the conventional way, it really looks like it's hurt or
wounded.  If it's on a flat bed, its getting a piggy-back ride!

Also, some insurance companies will not cover the cost of a flat-bed tow,
so check just to make sure you know who is going to end up paying for it.
