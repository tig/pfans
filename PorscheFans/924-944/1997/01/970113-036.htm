To check the effectiveness/condition of the LSD, lift one side of the car
only off the ground. Put a torque wrench on one of the rear wheel lug nuts
(the one off the ground) and measure how much torque is required to turn
the wheel. Anyone know approximately how many foot pounds a working LSD
should read with this method?

Also is it true the Torsen LSD was introduced on the 968 mid-model year in
1994? How do you tell/test if it is Torsen or the 944 clutch? style LSD?

Can anyone confirm that their is a second vehicle ID label in the
owner's
warranty & maintenance booklet? Mine is and it's also mentioned that it
should be there in my owner's manual.
