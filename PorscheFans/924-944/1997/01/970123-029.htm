This sounds too good to be true and I would be very wary of a car this
cheap.  It could easily need a clutch, motor mounts, radiator, steering
rack, head gasket, etc.  If it actually is in excellent condition you =
have
a rare find at a bargain.  Buy it!  Before my son found his '89 951
locally we had one checked out in Atlanta.  It was supposed to be in
excellent condition also and it was $16K.  The inspection revealed a long
list of needed repairs, costing at least $5,000.  We passed.  Hope you
have better luck.
