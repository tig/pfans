It sure sounds like a vacuum leak to me.  If you lose a small vacuum
line at normal driving speeds, it essentially does not affect you.  
However, you may lose idle entirely.  I would start with a visual check of 
all vacuum connections, especially the intake boot downstream of the air
flow sensor.   If you find nothing, get a friend to hold the engine at normal
idle, and spray carburetor cleaner around all intake connections and 
vacuum lines.  An rpm change will tell you that you are close.

Good luck.

Dave
