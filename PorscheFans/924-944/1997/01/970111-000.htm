Hi David,

Have you considered your Fuel Pressure Regulator?  I have an 87 944
that had this regulator go bad and it ended up killing my fuel  pump!  The
symptom prior to the fuel pump failing is I had a suddent loss of power
and then the car stalled.  This was found only after the Porsche
mechanic replaced the fuel pump and the car started right up only to loss
power and stall.  They were supprised because the regulators seldom
fail.  In fact, they had to order it and have it shipped to them.  I was
thinking that yours may be on its way.  A fuel pressure gauge will
determine the health of the fuel pressure regulator.

Anyway, hope this helps!

Karl
