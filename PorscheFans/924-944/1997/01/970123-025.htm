I have an '87 951 and wonder:  Why is the rear passenger carpet underneath
the floor mat damp?  I've taken it out and put a towel there for now, but
I'd
prefer not to be driving around with a leak.  Are there any idiosycrocies
of
these things that cause them to do this?  
---------
I had the same thing... Although just prior to the discovery, I had heard
about problems that the acid of the battery could leak out and go right
through the steel making it leak for water. I just couldn't believe that
was the problem with my 1988 924S, I didn't even bother to check.

After a few weeks when I was installing an alarm system and a carphone, I
looked into the right wheel-case (what do you call it in English ??).
Anyway, there's a hole there for a wire that goes to the side indicator
light. The rubber around it had popped out ! Causing water beneath the
passenger seat: not really if it rained, just if it *had* rained (driving
through pools of water) or when I had thoroughly cleaned the car...

Anyway, I hope that's the problem with your car (not the battery thing !)
and this helps (you can simply put the rubber thing back in, but don't push
it to far through the hole !!)...
