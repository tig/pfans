Folks,

Thanks for all the responses -- I'll sumarize what I've heard below.
Seems like I need to get an experienced driver in the car ...

My car is a '90 944 S2 Cabriolet.  No limited slip, no sports suspension,
no suspension modifications, shocks, sway bars etc recently checked  
out OK.
Standard rims, tires are Goodrich Comp TA front (205/55R16 as per spec) 
and rear (245/45ZR16 spec is 225/50, so rears are wider than usual, but 
mounted on the standard rims).  All rubber is in good shape -- I  
run 36/40 psi.
I've not previously owned a high-performance automobile.  I've  
experienced
a fair amount of throttle-induced oversteer (large amount in the  
rain).  Also
feel oversteer in trail-breaking (not AGRESSIVE breaking).  The latter is
easier to control, and I'm beginning to learn how to use it.

Here are (edited) responses to my original query -- mixed opinions as
to whether this is normal or not, and where the problem might be,
if there is one.  I seem to have lost george Beuselinck's original
response, he'd mentioned that worn shock might be the problem.  Shocks
on the car are OK.

I wonder aloud if my Cabriolet might be more susceptible to this than a
coupe, due to less body stiffness.

Regards to all
Todd K. Leen
'90 S2 Cab.

HI Todd.

Could be lousy tires.  My 944S has lots of rubber, but does the  
same thing
when cornering.  It has the M474 sport suspension and is a bit  
stiff.  The
rear tires are Falken 225 X 50 16", and don't hold a candle to my  
normally
aspirated 944, standard suspension with the same size tires and  
wheels, but
have Perelli P7 tires.  My 944 (does have Turbo S sway bars front  
and rear)
is a far better handling car... Till I replace the tires on my S,  
that is.

Todd -- I'm curious about your oversteer problem because I rarely
experience it in my S2, and I've spent the last few months dialing out
understeer. Exactly when do you get this oversteer, and how is your S2
suspension set up? The only times I've experienced oversteer on the  
street
is when the road surface has low traction (water, gravel, tar  
patch), when
I'm braking VERY hard and turning at the same time, or when I'm carrying
too much speed into a sweeper.  Sounds like your tires are worn, or  
a brand
that has comparatively little traction.

-- Nick

Hi Todd,

If you are correct that the rear tires are on 8" rims there should  
be quite
a bulge of rubber about the rim edge to the tire tread.  If you  
look at the
tire from the rear of the car, how far out does the sidewall extend past
the edge of the rim?

....

Ideally, the tire sidewall should extend less than one inch beyond  
the dedge
of the rim ...

-------

(Rears ARE 8" rims.  I don't see the mentioned bulge -- fronts and  
backs look about the same in this respect.)
