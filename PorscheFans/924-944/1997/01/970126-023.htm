<Most radiator "repairs" consist of brazing the ends of the
damaged tubes so they don't leak.   BUT they don't work
any more either.   If the radiator damage was extensive, you
might not have much of your radiator left working.  Consider
replacement.

Also, I wonder if your thermostat is working?   When the car 
is hot, is the radiator hot?   Is it all hot, or just part of it?

Good luck.

Thanks Dave for some constructive advice, finally. The radiator was =
totally recored, and the theromostat seems to be working, ie, the fan =
kicks in and out. Although I will pull it off and have a look. I will =
also have a feel around the radiator when I'm being told it is hot, =
generally speaking and from memory, it seems to be. 

Also, a really quick blast of hard work will also pop it up the red.
