 I'm favouring buying an older 944, maybe I can find one with busted 
 A/C, door-dings etc. but good mechanically & straight clean body for
 under $3K. These cars are a much more modern design than a 914,
 less prone to rust etc.  A few more $K for suspension, safety gear 
 etc. and you'd be racing. Of course a 914 makes a fine race car as 
 well, but is a different kind of beast - just depends what you're 
 into.
 I think in order to run either of these cars, you've got to be 
 willing to do plenty of work on them yourself, or be willing to spend 
 more than the value of the car having it brought up to spec. and 
 maintained by a shop. I'm in the former category - I love working on
 my cars & have a nice garage with air tools etc.
 
 I'd appreciate comments from the listers on this topic - suitable 
 entry-level, low-budget track Porsches and their pro's & cons.

Guys, here's the cold truth. The state of PCA Club Racing is INHO not good.
It is a lot different then it was in its early years. It has gotten to be a
jump off point to pro racing and the competition is fierce as is the
technology. It doesn't matter which car you buy or which class you are
planning to race- it's going to cost of bundle to make and keep your car
competative.
That being said I hope that anyone who has the urge does get involved because
it is more than a thrill. It's the most fun you can have in your car even if
Pamela Anderson is involved. Get an inexpensive car and make the necessary
mods. If push comes to shove, and it will, you can junk your initial
investment and put all those racing goodies into another cheap base car. Do
not take a car that you love and start Club Racing. Consider the car
disposable and you will have the right attitude. Not that Club Racing
approaches a destruction derby but be realistic, it is true racing. It's a
whole lot different then Drivers ed events and the wrong split second
decision can lead to damage. Stuff happens.
Have a great time!!
Jerry (E Stock 951)
