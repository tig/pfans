Ted,

While I agree that the Boxter looks better in person, I don't think it
makes the 993 look dated. The 993 greenhouse is the most dated part of the
car and yet the car would not look right if you changed it.

I had a chance to go look at the Boxter the other night. The dealer had a
single red one on the showroom floor. Not far away was a 993 C4S. That car
is so much more impressive than the Boxter I can't believe it. Yes, the
Boxter is new and all that, but it looks like a less expensive car. If I
wanted a convertible, I am sure I would get the Boxter because it looks
much better than 993 Cabriolet (designed to be a convertible versus not).

However, I would pick the 993 coupe anyday.
