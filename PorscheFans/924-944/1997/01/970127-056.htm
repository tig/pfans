	I think the price difference between this car and a good
	car would be small enough that you'd should buy the good
	car to begin with. This car is worth, maybe, 2.5 to 3K. A good
	86 is usually offered for around 6-7K so we're talking about
	3-4K difference. Since a new 944 hood is 2K by itself, you see you
	could rapidly surpass this 3-4K difference with just a few parts,
	*not* including the neccessary quality paint work.
