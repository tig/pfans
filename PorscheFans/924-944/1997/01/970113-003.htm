Hi Ben,

I got no wheels today, but I guess I should post the usual disclaimer about
the sunroof.

To remove the sunroof you must have the car off, roof shut, and the
ignition key in that quasi on position.  That is the first imaginary detent
of the key.  That position is kind of clueless, but if the dash warning
lights go on you have gone too far.

Once the key is in the correct orientation (pointing up and down), push the
rocker switch backwards.  You should hear a whirring sound from the rear of
the car (not space aliens).  The two locking arms at the rear of the
sunroof should retract into the back of the roof.

Unclip the two front levers and begin by lifting the rear of the roof panel
upward.  Once lifted a few inches (1 to 2) you should be able to slide the
sunroof back and out of the plastic tung.  I have sometimes had the two
release levers flip closed when I lift the rear of the sunroof.  Make sure
that the levers are fully opened.

I assume you know all that, so:

If the two locking arms at the rear of the sunroof do not retract, check
the limit switches located in the rear of the car directly opposite of the
fuel filler cap.  You must remove the carpet with the rear interior light.
Also, there is a micro switch located directly in front of the sunroof, mid
way across.

Marv
