I am the still increadibly happy owner of a 1983 944 (name: Taneha) that
now has over 146,000 miles on it.  Other than the usual (rubber clutch,
motor mounts, water pump), does anyone else have any experience
with high-mileage 944s?  How long might the engine last with regular
maintenance?  Does anyone have any experience with rebuilding the
engine because it got tired (as opposed to blown)?  How much does it
cost?  Are there any other surprises that I should be looking for?  Yes,

would like to drive this car forever.  Thanks--James

James,

I have an 85.5 with 157K miles on it. My mechanic (a very knowlegdable 
944 person) thinks that the motor can go past 200K as long as the oil is 
changed regularly, and repairs are done when needed. I have certainly 
had more than my share of problems with the entire car, but it runs very 
strong and provides lot's of enjoyment for a daily driver. I also 
autocross regylarly and plan to club race one day.

As far as rebuilds go, I would expect to drop $2000 into it. There are 
some useful mods (like the #2 journal) that can be done. When you get 
the car back, it's like new, good for 200K more miles.

BTW I have replaced all of my suspension bits that wear, and the 
handling of the car is 200% better. That's money well spent.

My next work: new radiator and oil-cooler overhaul.

rgds,

Tim Betteridge
85.5 944, 157,000 miles and counting
