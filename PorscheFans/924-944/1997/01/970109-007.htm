>        I had a discussion about MTL's with Marv DeBeque via email, and
since the topic came up again, I thought I'd add my two cents....

>After I changed from Swepco to RedLine MTL in my '87 944S, the cold shifting
is DRAMATICALLY better.  Like night and day.  Well worth the $8 a quart
I
paid (took almost 3 quarts).

>One question for the group:  when the car is good and warm, like highway
driving or extended city driving, the free play (especially
side-to-side) in
the shifter becomes stickier and stickier.  I don't really have a
problem
getting it into and out of gear, but it's got me a little stumped....

        Anyone else have this problem? 
        Is it something that needs checking into?

Andy, 

I have the same problem. I am told by my mechanic that one of the two
(one lateral and fore-and-aft) transmisiion bushings is worn resulting
in the above symptoms. I don't know the part numbers for these bushings
though. Maybe someone does ? 

My mechanic claims to have a neat trick that doesn't require dropping
the tranny though.
