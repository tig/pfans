Hi,

   Thank you for writing. The e-mail that you were going to attach about the
harness bars did not come through. Could you please re-send it ?  I know that
what you described is the way PCA wants the harness attached, but I am trying
to find out why.  I know that a 1" harness bar is not strong enough (that is
what most places sell), but by looping the strap over the bar and then
attatching it to the frame you are actually increasing the load on the bar.
   The mounting points on the "C" pillar are plenty strong, because they are
designd to attach a rear seat shoulder strap. In my car I used a 1 3/4" bar
with .0120" wall thickness and grade 8 hardware. I don't want to go to a club
event and have someone with no clue telling me that my harness is installed
wrong.
   Does anyone have a coppy of the design spec. or rule manual that they
could post ?
