Folks,

It's common for the cruise controller to fail -- symtoms include
not setting a speed, or continued acceleration when attempting to
set.  Mine has a soft fail -- it refused to set until the car has
been driven about 15 minutes.  My mechanic checked the vacuum lines -
no problem there.  Rather than spend the several hundred bucks for
the new controller box (it lives above the hood release under the dash),
I decided to live with the problem.

Last night I discovered a patch.  I was warming up the car in the  
driveway
to check the coolant level.  I had the heater on full blast and the car
was nice and toasty when I got in to drive off.  The cruise control  
worked
immediately!

So there's some component in my failing controller that needs to be  
warmed
up before it operates.  If you're experiencing a cruise control problem,
try turning on the heater (with the floor vents wide open).

Regards
TKL
