Mathew,

I thought I answered this once already.   Well, anyway,

>I have recently restored a 1978 924 (LHD 2Ltr Injection) the car had been

Do you have electrical power to the warmup regulator and auxiliary air valve?
It comes from a relay, which often fails.   Check for battery voltage at the
plug for each, with the ignition on.

I would first check the injectors.   Even if you cleaned the tank, crap in
the fuel
will make its way to the injectors first.   Pull them, and spray into a
large can.
You should see finely atomized fuel, not thin little streams.

Check with a voltmeter at the battery while it is happening.   If you get 16
volts at
the battery it is time for a new alternator.   

Good luck.
