On second thoughts maybe my '84 944 has a perfectly functional limited slip. Here 
goes: My car weighs 2778 lbs. Assuming a 50% axle load rear and front (which is 
darn close to reality), and a 50% lateral load (which may be quesionable depending 
on how heavy you are), that puts about 695 lbs on each wheel. A factory limited 
slip limits only upto 40%, which means the torque difference between the 2 wheels 
can be upto 40% of 695 lbs = 278 lbs, after which the wheels should lose synch. 
Accounting for one rear wheel, my 225/50/15 has about a 0.5 (ft)^2 contact patch, 
which means the torque on the road necessary for the diff. to slip is about 278*2 
= 556 lb ft. That means, sitting on the road with 695 lbs on the wheel (more when 
I am in the car), when one wheel starts spinning on ice and the other sits still 
on dry pavement, the limited slip is working fine and slipping like it is supposed 
to, since the weight on it (695+ lbs) is more than the torque it is supposed to 
limit the slip till (556 lb ft.).

This also makes sense because you wouldn't want the diff. to limit slip when you 
are taking a corner hard at 70 mph and your inner rear wheel has hardly any weight 
on it while the outer wheel has a lot of weight on it. That would cause serious 
understeer. The 40% limit must help with straight line acceleration and low g 
turns. This would also mean that the vehicle speed has an effect on the limited 
slip's operation since going on gravel at 60 mph the effective weight on each 
wheel would be far less than 556 lbs, and an open differential would make the car 
fish-tail wildly whereas the limited slip should keep the tail straight regardless 
of the difference in traction and torque between the 2 wheels.

Where did you get the figure of 100 lb ft. torque limit for slippage George B.? 
Please correct any miscalculations.
