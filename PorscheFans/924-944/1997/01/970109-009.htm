Subject: 84 - 944

     I have just been notified of a 1984 944 that is going up for sale
     by one of the local insurance companies!!! Apparently the car
     was taken for a joy ride around the gentleman's property (small
farm)
     I have not seen the car yet but I do know that the ignition is
broken
     and that they are unable to start the car!! I guess either some
glass
     or the door lock is broken! ( no big deal ) I am not sure as to how
     bad the body is ??? I have been told that the insurance company
will
     get the car running before I go and take a look so at least I can 
     take it for a ride!! My question is what is one of these cars worth
     in mint condition?? and given the info supplied what would any of
you
     944 guys pay for this thing????? Any help would be much appreciated
     I live in Toronto Canada so pls let me know if you are talking
about 
     American funds! 
     Thanks A.P

I would check the TO auto traders. I would expect about $CA 7500. I
think you will find that they are slightly cheaper here in Canada (after
exchange) than the US.
