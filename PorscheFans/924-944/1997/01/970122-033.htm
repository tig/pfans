Good choice.

You will need a good set of snow tires (~$500) for year round driving
which means ~ $1,000(used) for spare rims  unless you don't mind 
messing up your good rims putting on and taking off snows.

>Is this car expensive to maintain?  I now drive a 1990 BMW 735i and I'm
>assuming that parts/labor will be about the same.  Is this correct?

About the same I would think.  My sister has a BMW and pays more/year
but then I've been very lucky so far only new tires needed to date and
oil/belt checks of course. 

>Any oddball gotchas to look out for?

Timing Belts and rollers must be replaced on time which for a 968 is
45,000
miles max. even if owners manual says 60,000.  Also water pump checked
and belts checked and retensioned every 15,000 miles.

Check A-arm/ball joints well before purchase.  Has been a problem on
lowered
and tracked cars. (~$500 in rebuilt parts)

You will need a new battery soon if it is the original.  

Rubber clutch disk centers can be a problem (~ $800 parts + 8 hr)

>The clutch in this car seems to grab close to the top of the pedal

968 has a hydraulic clutch which isn't adjustable per say.  Clutch pedal
can be
set for height adjustment so may have some effect on when things happen.
Have seller pressure bleed clutch slave before you buy and recheck to
see if
clutch releases high.  Mine is perfect but took a little getting use to
at first.
I have to rev higher to start in 1st gear than I was use to.  Everyone
who
has driven my car stalls it on the first try.

>At what interval should the timing belt be changed?

See above

>Do you 968 owners have trouble finding parts?  I've looked through
>excellence magazine and Panorama and most after market parts places have
>parts for 911,924,944, and 928.  I know that lots of parts for the 968
>are the same as a 944S2, but the ads specifically say 944 and have year

No problems yet but we will never see the level of support the 911
or 944 had in after market parts since only 4005  coupes/cabs
were imported.  Many interior parts are the same as 944S2 but
many engine/trans parts are not.

>Finally, the price on this car is $28,950.  It has 39K miles, leather
>seating surfaces, and 17inch wheels.  I'm not sure yet about the LSD.

>too high.

Seems reasonable to slightly high to me but if it has the LSD and M030
package which the 17" wheels may point to and is really clean then OK.
The 39K miles seems a little high for a 94 but not too bad.  The one
year
warranty will come in handy sorting out any hidden problems that might
crop up.  I have seen 1994 cars with 25,000 miles listed for $28,000 no
warranty.  Check out Panorama the Porsche Club of American's mag
for prices.  It will sure be a better car than any non Porsche you
would pay $28,000 for.  If you really enjoy driving go for it.
