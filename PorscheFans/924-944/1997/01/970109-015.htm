Have you checked the idle control valve (idle stabilizer as some call it)?
It is an air valve which is driven by a motor under control of the engine
computer. It functions to richen or lean the mixture on demand to control
idle speed. It sometimes gets dirty and sticks and the engine will feel like
it is gutless until the car warms up.

It is the silver tube under the intake manifold. Pull the hoses off and
try spraying it with brake cleaner or something like that. Gotta pull the
intake to change it if that doesn't fix the problem.

You can check the injector o-rings by misting water around the injectors
when the engine is running rough. You should be able to see water pool and
then be drawn into the injector hole. Maybe also detect a change in the idle
as the water gets sucked in. Those are a breeze to replace, BTW, but I don't
think that is your problem.

Get underneath and check for loose things or take it to a shop and ask them
to diagnose. Shouldn't cost more than $50 or so to get an opinion. Sorry I
can't help more there.
