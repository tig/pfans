Excellent commentary Farzaan.

I have a question.  Exactly how do you loose power below 5000rpm with the MAF?
 With free-er flowing air wouldn't you gain more power at a lower rpm?

This is the one upgrade that hasn't been done to my car.  While I don't have
much power from a stand still, I have lots of power above 3000rpm.  If a MAF
isn't worth trying, I'm not going to get one.

I too have tinkeritis, however mine seems best applied by getting to know the
car better.  For example changing the belts and pulleys, preparing the car for
the street (it currently is in the garage awaiting warmer weather).  There are
lots of little things that need attention to.  Even though it isn't as much fun
as "upgrading" the car (it is more like maintenance, but NEVER call it that, or
it will be that), it is interesting to see how well the car is put together and
such.

Have fun!!
