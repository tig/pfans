I'll add my comments to the several recent msgs on 968's. I have a 94
which was actually manufactured in May 93. It replaced a 944 which I had
for 8 years.The 968 has 17" wheels and six speed xmission. One would
think that those big fat tires would last for ever .. dont expect to get
more than about 15000 on the rear ones even with no competive use. The 
front ones seem to be wearing as expected. The one other complaint I
have is squeeks and rattles. The 968 with 17000 miles has more than the
944 had with 75000 miles. The hatch back rattles took three trips to the 
dealer.. They replaced the back window each time at about $2000 a pop. 
The rattles now seem to have to do with the sun roof. If any body out
there has any suggestions on that would appreciate hearing. Its no
different than a 944. The most surprising and disappointing problem has
just cropped up.. rust in the rocker panel. The dealer says they will
fix it but will need a week to do it. They just dont use salt on the
streets here in Texas ! I'm not sure I agree about better fit and finish
than 944's mentioned in another msg. I do agree with the other msgs
regarding torque all across the band. Its by far the 968's best feature 
and most dramatic improvement over the 944. The dual mass flywheel also
allows much easier clutch release and smoother gear shifting. When do we
change the e mail address to 924-944-968 ? Tom Nelson Dallas TX
