buyers.

Looking for a used 944 Turbo?
by Mike Kehr, Shattenbaum Region

In case you're looking for a used 944 Turbo (951) but are unsure of the
various model-year differences, here is a thumbnail sketch of the car from
1986 through 1989.

The 944 Turbo was first introduced in this country as an 1986 model. Some
cars with early VIN numbers had problems with cracking exhaust manifolds
and a leaky fuel line coupling. An improvement in the exhaust system was
made in '87 involving a change in the crossover pipe, which takes off 5
hours of labor when changing the clutch, and a redesigned water pump and
motor mounts. These problems may have been corrected if the owner took
advantage of Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) Campaign notifications made
during the 5-year warranty period (look for documentation).

In 1987, ABS brakes and dual air bags were offered as options. Changes 
were
made to the front wheel geometry to accommodate the ABS, which changed the
wheel offset, and various corrections to the 1986 model were fitted in 
this
model-year. A self-adjusting belt tensioner was also added.

A special, limited edition model, the 944 Turbo S, was produced in 1988 as
a direct result of factory preparations made for the Porsche Turbo Cup 
race
series. This special model, with silver rose metallic paint and matching
plaid interior, came equipped with 928 S4 brakes, an engine with 247 bhp,
new vanes in the turbocharger, and DME remapping. Minor changes were made
to the fender areas to accommodate the larger tires and wheels, and the 
car
was loaded with all the options: Sport suspension (M 030), stronger manual
transmission and limited slip differential, and clutch modifications.
Approximately 700 cars of this limited edition model were shipped to PCNA.
The standard (non-S) turbo was also available in 1988 and is a great buy; 
a
lot of bugs were worked out by this time.

In 1989, the Turbo S model, which was a special edition in 1988, was the
"standard" and only version available for the U.S. This was the last year
of production of the 944 Turbo. The car came in all color combinations and
with all options available.

The Turbo S cars of 1988 and 1989 produce almost 65 hp per cylinder and, 
as
a result, may have a greater need for maintenance or repair, especially if
the previous owner used the higher performance potential (drivers tended 
to
run these cars harder). So, expect higher repair bills if you purchase 
this
model. I believe this is the best 944 Turbo, but, as you can see, there 
are
trade-offs. The S models will also demand the highest price of the 944
Turbo models.

Regardless of which model-year 944 Turbo you find interesting, I suggest
you obtain a pre-inspection by someone who "knows" these cars. It may be
well worth the effort.
