Need some advice.  I have a 1983.5 944 (35,000 miles) in great shape.  I
rarely drive it in winter, except on dry days to give it exercise, but this
winter has been warm, so I've had it out recently.  

Two days ago the outside temperature dropped into the 5 degree Farenheit
range, with incredibly low humidity.  When I started the car, the interior
fan would not work, in any of the three positions on the switch.  After
about 15 minutes of driving, the fan came on, and would work in all three
switch positions.  It continued to work even after shutting off and
re-starting the vehicle.

Next morning...fan doesn't work again.  Drive for about 10 minutes...fan
works.

Next afternoon (outside temp about 10 degrees F).  Fan doesn't work at
start-up.  Still doesn't work after about 40 minutes of driving.  I leave
car running at one stop for about 10 minutes...get back in car, interior
fan is running.  I leave switch in third position (highest), thinking I'll
free up system...drive for about 15 minutes, fan in third position stops
working while driving....will not work in second position...BUT still runs
in first (slowest) position on switch.

I'd be grateful for suggestions on what problem and solution might be.

Thanks,

Marty Anderson (e-mail:  martyand@tiac.net)
