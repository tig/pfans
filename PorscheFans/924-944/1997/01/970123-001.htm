So far I have two kind fellows commenting on the product, one is positive
and the other negative.  I expressed skeptism to the company and was
replied as follows:

x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	x	

I was just as skeptical when I read the quote on my 85 Audi 5000S, that was
three years ago. The car actually performed alot better than I was quoted.
This is not only my finding, but many other people with VW products. It
seems that 1985 and older vehicles were equipped with not much more than a
slightly modified "Bug" Ignition, the EPA rated your Porshe (New) with a
74%
fuel burn, with our ignition we can guarantee a minimum of a 99% fuel burn,
guaranteed (30 day money back) you put it on, if it doesn't perform to your
standards, return it.

We don't create a miracle, we just use the 25% of the gas your car waste.
It
doesn't take much to see that the numbers for your car are easily attained,
especially when your using a 65k coil, microprosser computer and a plug gap
of .065.

The computer adjusts the spark for every cylinder, every fire...It has the
ability to change the intensity and duration of every spark
produced.....the
coil has full voltage available from the time the key comes on to over 7k
RPMS.....

Anyway I thank you for the oppurtunity to maybe help with some of your
fears, if you need any other info just ask.

Anyone has different thoughts or experience?  Appreciate your input.
