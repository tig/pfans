I am about to have my car aligned after the suspension modifications are
 complete.  Before I do this,  I would like to hear other owners opinions of
 alignment specs.

Jerry was completely right on this one,  I assumed that everyone knew what
my post-alignment intentions for the car were (which is really silly,
because I don't know!).

Some much needed info:

Car:            86 951
Tires:          soon to be Dunlop D40M2 or Bridgestone RE-71's 
                225/50/16 Front,  245/45/16 Rear
Anti-Sway 
Bars:           Stock 951 (but subject to change)

Springs:        Front 260lb/in, Rear 29mm
Shocks:         Custom valved (similar to Koni sports)

Ride height:    1 1/4" lower in front, 3/4" lower in rear

Driving:        This is my daily driver,  but it will see 6-8 autocrosses
and 2-3 track                 events per year,  and of course, much spirited
street driving        

Driving Experience:     Experienced,  but always learning!


If any one can shed some light on recommended alignment settings,  maximum
front camber achievable,  effects of front toe-out on this car,  etc,  I
would really appreciated it!

Thanks again,
