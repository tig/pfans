>>The mile-ometer has stopped working on my 83 924, the speedo still works
fine so I assume it is something internal, is it possible to repair this
function, if not does anybody have a speedo to sell with about 96k Miles
showing. (Pref in the UK)
Thanks

I have an 88 924S, and my odometer stopped at 88K.  The problem was a gear
that broke.  My mechanic sent it away to be fixed and it took about 6 weeks
to come back.  However, he swears that they all break between 75K-100K, and
that the fix is better than a new or used one, and should last as long as I
keep the car.  The fix cost me about $125.00 altogether.  More than I
expected, but worth it if it lasts.
