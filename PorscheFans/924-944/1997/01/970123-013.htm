Hello P-Fans,

I justed wanted to thank everybody who responded to my e-mail
concerning my 944 stalling during a cold morning warming.  Since alot of
the responses came to me personnaly, I thought I would share with
everybody what I've learned (and believe to have been  the problem).

I believe Barry Lenoble hit the nail on the head when he asked if I had
any accessories on.  I've learned the the 944 alternator isn't designed to
handle a large load during idle (1000 rmps), so if a large number of
accessories are on, the battery will kick in and will  supply most of the
current and if left idling long enough, it will drain and die.  Well,  it turns
out that I had my parking lights, fog lights, rw defroster, heater, etc.. on.  I
haven't had a problem since.  I just figured that most cars can warm up
on a cold morning, so I thought why not the 944.  Well, I'm learning.   

Also, there seems to be a consensus that it is best to get in the car and
drive on a cold morning (i.e., no need to let the car warm up) but keep it
under 4K rpms until the heater indicator starts to move (i.e.i take it easy).

Again, thanks everybody.  Its nice when I don't have to spend money on
the car other than for maintenance!!!
