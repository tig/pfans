Hi everyone.
I'm new to PorscheFans - joined because I have recently bought a 1977 - 924. 
Poor thing has been abused over the last 20 years, but now has a good loving 
home. I have had a full engine re-build, brake system, suspension re-bushed 
etc. etc. etc.

I have 2 remaining problems to sort out before getting the bodyshop to give 
the car a new shine, and could do with some help.

1) The car starts like a dream when cold, wet or frosty - also no problems 
when really hot. It seems like I have a warm start problem. If  the car is 
left for 10 minutes or more, it becomes almost impossible to start without 
cranking for ages - the danger of course is that if it doesn't start I end up 
with a flat battery.

My local Porsche dealer hinted vaguely at there being a classic problem of 
this kind on early 924's - (mine is engine number 606) - and suggested a 
modification kit was what was needed at some ridiculous price. The dealer has 
not looked at the car so cannot say for sure whether or not the mod has been 
fitted.

How can I identify whether or not the mod has been done. If it is fitted, 
maybe it is not functioning correctly.

2) My 924 has an original, factory-fitted electric, metal sunroof measuring 
90cm x 30cm which another well meaning soul tells me is actually a 911 
sunroof.
It is leaking like a sieve and I am not sure whether all the parts are still 
there to fix it. 

How can I identify the sunroof ?
Where can I get a diagram showing what the complete operating mechanism looks 
like? Is there a down load available anywhere?

Looking forward to replies and hoping to be an active participant to 
PorscheFans,

Regards

Mike Granlund.
