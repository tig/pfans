This has been a common theme for me over the last almost 20 years of
motoring....

Check out the Kelley Blue Book home page at: http://www.kbb.com/. The Kelley
Blue Book is the one used by the majority of lending institutions and
insurance companies to determine what a vehicle is worth. It is a really
cool web site that will allow the user to obtain both loan/wholesale pricing
as well as "retail" pricing (back to 1977 in the regular "used car" section
and further back [I think] in the "classic car" section). In your case, you
want "retail" pricing. I made some assumptions about your car and, depending
on what part of the country you live in, the pricing seems to range form
about 11,000-12,500 (not including the sales tax that you are due). Run a
search yourself to include the right options and proper locality. If this
search seems to make a case for you, you might head to Bookstar or
Books-a-Million (or similar establishment) and check out the printed copy of
the blue book as a comparison. The public library is also another possible
place to find the blue book. You might look at the NADA guide also, but the
regular issue only goes back 5 or 6 years (I think).

>The details of my car are/were as follows:
>
>*all original equipment and most options

(this helps, try to find documentation to prove that your particular car
has/had a certain "package" e.g.- "S" or "cup").

>*32,000 miles

(this helps too, but usually only to the extent that your car isn't branded
"high mileage"; this results in subtraction of dollars from the total retail)

>*mint condition (could have been driven into any showroom)

(this may help your argument for more money if the adjuster is in a good
mood, but that is probably about it) :-)

>*always factory serviced
>*never raced/abused/neglected in any way

(unfortunately, the last two don't matter, except to you....sounds like it
was a nice car...)  :-((

>What I'm looking for is some 'proof' regarding the value of 
>my car at the time of the accident

Unfortunately, the Blue Book is "current" pricing. You may be able to find
back issues at a library (or if you've got a friend at a bank who keeps old
ones). Check for back issues of the NADA guide too. The older copy may
include your car.

Best of luck on your crusade,
