To Christopher Costantino, thanks for the hatch latch tip.

I'd like to add that at the bottom of the inside of each latch is a hollow-cone-shaped 
piece of hard rubber that the post on the hatch fits into.  My guess is that this piece 
serves two purposes.  First, it keeps the post good and tight inside the latch and 
second, it pops the post up enough upon opening to clear the latching mechanism.  I 
bought my '88 Turbo S about a year ago and while trying to find out why the hatch was 
difficult to open, I discovered that these rubber pieces had deteriorated and cracked 
into several pieces.  The right latch refuses to let go without manually lifting.  I 
believe that this, along with tired hatch "shocks", is my problem.  This may also 
be related to the squeeking hatch problem on some cars.  After taking care of a couple 
of more important (i.e. expensive) repairs, I'll replace the latches and shocks and 
report my results.

Thanks,

Mike Fields
'88 944 Turbo S
