Hello P-Fans,                                                                   

Does anyone know if the analog clock in the 968 has a light?  I have never      
seen mine light up. Do I need to replace a bad light or was the clock designed  
that way? (can't see it at night)                                               

Also to answer James question about buying a 968: The 968 is fabulous car to    
drive.  I was grinning for about a month after my first drivers ed weekend, and 
most of the P-Folks at the event agreed that the 968's handling was perhaps     
equal or better than the 993 at the event. (according to Porsche engineers the  
968 is still the handling standard for other Porsches to match. Excellence Mag) 

According to PCNA only 593 Cabs and 595 Coupes were sold in 92. 475/713 in 93.  
648/616 in 94 and 215/150 in 95. As you can see used parts could be a problem   
but a benefit could be exclusivity.  Good luck in you search.
