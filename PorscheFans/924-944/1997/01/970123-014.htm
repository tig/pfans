I had a problem with excessive belt noise from my car.  I haven't put the car
back together yet, but I can make some guesses why the car was noisy.

The balance shaft pulley made some zipping noise when it was spun rapidly with
my fingers.  This isn't a good indicator to the noise it makes when under load.
 It also didn't have as much grease as any of the other rollers.  I ordered a
new one anyway to be safe.

The balance shaft roller was adjusted opposite to what it should be.  It should
be .5mm away from the belt on the lower balance shaft.  This is so that when
the balance belt slacks up under high revs it doesn't come off the balance
shaft. (atleast that is why I think it is there).

The roller (idler) was adjusted upward so that the balance shaft belt was
riding over the top of it.  Since the roller is smooth and the belt is
toothed(?) it would create a zipping (or whizzing) type noise.  The frequency
of the noise would increase with revs.

That is basically my guess to what the noise was.  The belt was riding the
upper portion of the idler pulley.  This could have easily reduced the lifespan
of my belt...

What a pain trying to find decent mechanics...(well I should say decent Porsche
944 mechanics)
