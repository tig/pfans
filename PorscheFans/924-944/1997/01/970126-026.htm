This is a fine proceedure, but it only serves to test for potential throwout
bearing troubles, not pilot bearing problems. The pilot bearing is located
at the terminal end of the driveline shaft (the end of the shaft that goes
through the clutch disk). Often, the pilot bearing is neglected during a
clutch change. I didn't see the original post, but if this is a fairly high
mileage car (or if the cluch has previously been changed) and if the noise
is continual at some level, it could potentially be the pilot bearing. My
advice...get another opinion from someone qualified to diagnose Porsche
problems.
