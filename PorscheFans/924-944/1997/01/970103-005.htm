Euroselect was a parts brand created by Porsche Cars North America in Reno.  
They attempted to create a brand to be sold by dealers that was less expensive 
than the "genuine Porsche Parts" brand that they typically sell.  The part 
numbers were more or less the same, but some of the parts came from secondary 
sources.

The obvious overall goal was to gain additional parts sales (volume and 
resulting margin) through competing more directly with mail order outfits and 
others selling "OEM equivalent" parts, while only minimally cannibilizing their 
high margin "Genuine Porsche Parts" brand business.  They even created a 
catalog which is an excellent reference for the do-it-yourselfer.  You may be 
still able to get one of these-- the one I have is for water-cooled cars and 
has a picture of a Turbo S on it.  PCNA discontinued this program.  I was told 
that it never really caught on, especially in the East.

Originally, I bought a Euroselect clutch kit because it was about $150 cheaper 
than the "Genuine Porsche Parts" which I could get from my dealer, and the "OEM 
equivalent" parts I could get mail order.  The only part that was different 
from the "Genuine" factory kit was the throw out bearing, which was inferior.

I spoke with a parts representative from PCNA at the Sac Valley Region's '96 
Crab event who was representing the company (and autocrossing and rallying Fred 
Schwab's car!   (Schwab is the PCNA CEO).  This rep let me know about the 
Porsche Parts Express (PPE) program which is now in place.  The new program is 
more or less a price rollback on many "Genuine Porsche Parts" which form the 
bulk of the volume.  Again, the aim is to gain additional parts sales volume 
and resulting margin via direct competition with the alternative parts sellers.

By the way, I buy about 99% of my (new) parts from a local dealer called 
Carlsen.  The are in Palo Alto, California, and have one of the strongest parts 
businesses in the U.S.  Carlsen, like several other dealers nationwide, is 
willing to be aggressive when necessary on parts prices.  I almost always get 
them to meet or beat the alternative suppiers prices, even when I factor in the 
heavy (~8%) sales tax, which I could avoid via mail order.
