Oh gawd, what now?

My recent roadtrip to the rockies shook out a bug.
 -or more correctly shook in a crack -to my radiator.

I suppose all 944's use a plastic tanked radiator, but are
they all supported by four little rubber bumpers in their
mounting?
  Analysis of this shows an original radiator and
hoses dating 1984 ('84-944).  The support bumpers for the
rad seem to have gone flat and allowed the radiator to
vibrate only slightly in the mounts, but a 3 inch crack at the
upper hose end of the rad -up and over and down the tank
inboard of the hose nipple.
 To me this says the vibrational moment at that corner of the
rad where the hose attaches -caused the crack.  You can
check for this by tugging the upper big hose forward and backward
while observing for movement of the rad in its mounts.
My example had only a 1/4" of motion, but that is enough
to be a problem when traversing a couple thousand highway
miles.  (I wish they didnt use plastic in radiators)

  I considered shimming the mounts to tighten the grip
but I just let it have a blob of orange RTV.
  This was after a careful treatment of the crack with a dremel
tool and applying JB kwik-weld epoxy to the joint.

  The epoxy lasted one day.
  So now a new radiator is on its way.

  Assimilation:
  This original radiator was full of road rubbish and grit.
 -amazing amounts of insects and cottonwood fuzz.
  After spending a full day cleaning and (wishful) patching
the rad, the early results were excellent. . .my engine temp
dropped a half a division to just under the 'halfway' mark
on the gauge.  (and this is wintertime)
The design of the rad is such that the spiders between the
cores readily absorb garbage.  Mine looked ok on the outside
but shining the sun thru it before cleaning -I couldnt see any light!

  I would *highly* recommend cleaning your radiator first
if you want to squeeze out a bit more waste heat.

Removal is not too bad, just six capscrews, two mount nuts
and the hoses after the belly pan is off.
Everything comes out the bottom, so you'll need to lift the
front off her feet.  The book says to remove the wire harness
from the fans, but if you are careful, its not needed.

Radiator costs:
Vertex: $179
Europroducts: $199
Zim's: $239
Stoddard: <never mind>
