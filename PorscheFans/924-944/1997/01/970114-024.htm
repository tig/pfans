Maybe not.  In cold weather you will have a lot of condensation in the engine,
which will froth with the oil and look like what you described.   Do you have
oil showing up in the coolant reservoir?  If not, you could drain the oil and 
examine it.

You absolutely have to have the relief valve centering tool, not too expensive,
available from Porsche and some of the aftermarket places.  Without it, getting
proper oil pressure would be coincidental at best.

IF leakage is the problem, you just need to`change the O-rings.

The job is just as straight forward as you surmise.  It is done from underneath,
but is fairly easy to reach.  Make sure you clean the gasket surfaces.  And I
repeat, don't try this without the centering tool.  Zero oil pressure or runaway
oil pressure.

Overall, I think you have a condensation problem.  Oil is at a higher
pressure than
coolant, and it is much more likely to push oil into the coolant than the
reverse.
Chocolate milk in the reservoir is the classic symptom.  Having said that, I
have
advocated for years the precautionary replacement of the O-rings, because if you
read Porsche service bulletins, you have to replace the rod bearings if
coolant and
oil mix.  Really.  Look before you leap.

Good luck.
