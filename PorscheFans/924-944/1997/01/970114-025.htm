There have been reports of the spring tensioner hanging up when the bolt
is loosened, resulting in improper tension to the belt.  If you value your
engine (or your wallet), it would be prudent to recheck the tension with
The Gauge.  Besides, the balance shaft belt doesn't have a spring loaded
tensioner anyway, thus requiring The Gauge. 

Unfortunately, these cars are out of the VW Golf league, where the cam
belt could be tensioned by hand using the famed 'quarter twist' method. 
Unlike the Golf, these engines are an interference design.  Any
malfeasance under that belt cover will result in bent valves and an
unhappy owner.  Someone on this list reported valve damage from the cam
belt jumping _one_ tooth.  An overly tensioned belt will cause premature 
wear of the water pump, and we know what a joy that is to replace.

US versions have the spring tensioner as well,  '87 and later.

The 968 has the best design of all.  No tensioning required at all. It
tensioner that loads the belt at all times, hydraulically controlled, like
the 911 chain tensioner.  I would love to know if this can be retrofitted
to the earlier cars.
