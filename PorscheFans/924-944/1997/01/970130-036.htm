Let me introduce myself:

I recently joined the list and I'm please to see the chat seems friendly
and informative.  I'm looking forward to interacting with other members on
this list.

I recently purchased my second Porsche, a red '86 951 with 16" Fuchs,
leather club seats, sunroof and other goodies.  It has low mileage and is
in excellent shape.  I can't believe the power this car has compared to my
previous '87 924S, which at the time I couldn't believe the power it had 
:=)  The car has had all the pre-requisite maintenance, water pump
replaced, belt and belt tensioner replaced / updated, etc....  I am going
to replace the rotors this winter and would like to know what pads are
preferred by others.  My independent Porsche guy (Hi Charlie) recommends
Repco but I would like to know what else is out there and works.  I will be
autocrossing the car, but I'm not interested in ultimate braking ability
and  I am not interested in rapid wear of the rotors.

Also, what do I need to watch for on this particular model (beyond the
normal 944 stuff)? 

I currently have Mobil 1 in the engine (previous owner) but since I tend to
change the oil at 3000K intervals anyway what advantage is there to using a
more expensive oil?  I personally like Valvolene regular multi-weight.
