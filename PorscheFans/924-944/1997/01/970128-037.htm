Those of you who are tired of hearing me babble about my 2.8 $troker can skip
this.

The clock is ticking.  The J&E pistons have finally arrived.  A bit late for
Christmas, but who is complaining?  The piston and wrist pin weigh in at 98
grams less than the stock ones.  No fat pistons in my engine.  My builder jokes
that the bore and stroke are the same as a small block Chevy.   I am not
laughing as I look up the specs on a 350 4 bolt main Chevy.  Ahhhh!  We are
building half of a Chevy at twice the cost.  This sucker better have the torque
to pull stumps.

The ductile iron cylinder liners are now happily fusion bonded into the block.
The built in o-rings look real trick until he notices that the boring bar can
not be used because the deck is no longer perfectly flat with the o-rings
sticking up.  Out comes the hone.  You do not want to know how many hours it
takes to hone down these rock hard liners and how many sets of stones he has
gone through.  He makes a note to thank the liner manufacturer for saving him
the cost of a health club membership.  I make a note to start looking for a
second job.

Just as it looks like we are making progress, my builder starts eyeing the
intake manifold.  He is not happy with the port size or shape of the tubes.  A
call to George B. is in order.  After George gets frostbite looking at every 944
manifold in existence, my builder decides the best course of action is to chop
up my existing manifold.  George goes to Daytona for a week to recover.

Two turbos stare at us.  This will be a street car doing some track duty.  The
stock K26 with the small hot side, faster spin up but poops out on the top end.
The CUP or S turbo with the larger hot side, more lag but more kick once it gets
going.  Decisions, decisions, any advice out there?  Anyone have a KKK
compressor map for the Cup turbo in their sock drawer?.

Has anyone had any experience running ChamberBall bushings in place of the stock
rubber front strut bushings?  Figure as long as the entire front end has to come
off again, why not.

The light at the end of the tunnel may be a train.
