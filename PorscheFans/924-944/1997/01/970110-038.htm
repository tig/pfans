I would follow the specifications in the Owners Manual for oil viscosity
recommendations. Don't disobey factory guidelines, or you may be punished ;)
If you have engine noises that are not normal, you need to get someone's
opinion about it, instead of fiddling with oil viscosity.  For model year
1989, 20w 50 is good between 15 to 105 degrees F, so to the fellow who
says never to use 20w 50, ignore that comment.  Don't use 5w 30, unless
ambient temperatures in your area never go above 30 degrees F.  I would
change it immediately. 

RE: your questions below:

Noisy valves?  Both the iron block 924 engines and aluminum 924s/944
engines seem to have fairly 'clicky' valves, so get an opinion or two from
shops before you conclude you have a problem.  The fuel injectors on my 89
click a lot, and kind of sound like valves clicking.  My car indeed has
noisy valves all the time, but the engine performs perfectly.  With
hydraulic lifters, there is no adjustment.  I have been thinking of
installing one of those self-adhesive underhood insulator mats to keep the
noise down (I think the turbo cars come with these).

Any reputable, brand name filter is fine with any Porsche, unless you are 
truly a die hard, in which case, use the Porsche brand filter, which is 
just a Mann or Bosch unit anyway.

Change to 10w 40 right away.  It is good down to 0 degrees F.  Refer to
the owners manual for viscosity recommendations.  I use 20w 50 all year
'round, but on the West coast of the US, it rarely gets below freezing,
and the 90's (F) are the hottest it gets. 

A side note.. if you have just one cylinder clacking away, one of the 
lifters most likely has collapsed.. just let it idle for a few minutes 
and the lifter will pump up with oil as the engine warms up.
