Hello everyone....

Please excuse any simple questions I might ask, as I`ve only recently bought 
my first Porsche (and 2nd ever car), an '84 Guards Red 944. It`s quite a 
change from the 957cc Ford Fiesta I used to drive !! I`m hoping someone can 
put my over anxious mind at ease...

There seems to be a slight difficulty in shifting from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 
3rd. It`ll go in, but unless you time it so the clutch pedal hits the floor 
at the exact time you engage the new gear, it `clunks` in. I suspect it may 
well have something to do with the fact that there is over an inch of free 
play in the clutch pedal. Air in the system ? (He hopes..)

And, at low revs, both pulling away & in neutral there`s a rattle from the 
rear of the car. Am I right in thinking it`s just the torque tube rattling 
around ? Is it normal whilst at a standstill in neutral to hear a noise from 
the rear when releasing the clutch pedal ?

From the messages being banded around over the last 2 weeks, it seems like 
my symptoms are fairly common, I only hope they don`t ruin an otherwise 
perfect Porsche experience !

It would seem that us UK Porsche owners don`t suffer from the `red-neck` 
syndrome endured by our American counterparts. I have owned the car for 3 
weeks and have not had any real hassle apart from people sitting on my rear 
waiting for take off !

Sorry I can`t offer any usefull advice yet, but at least I can get the 
sunroof off.


All the best..
