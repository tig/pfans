David Johnson wrote "where to mount his accumulator (accusump)"

I have a 3 quart accumulator with the same problem.  I am unable to find any
place under the hood that it will fit.  

Jim Pasha told me some track cars remove the windshield washer reservoir and
mount it there.  I looked at this and determined part of the right headlight
would also have to be removed.  No go for a street car.  

Jerry Woods (911 builder) indicated it would fit if the air conditioner
compressor was removed.  OK for track cars but not for SoCal in the summer.

I then talked to a shop that installed accumulators.  They indicated they
mounted them on the passenger's floor on the right side.  They covered the
cylinder with a piece of matching carpet.  This would be OK if you never had to
get to your DME/KLR.  We plan to add MSD multi-spark to the DME and need access.

The best place I have found (to date) is on the passenger side backseat floor.
Take off the gauge and shutoff valve and it will fit.  I plan to attach a
flexible line to the gauge and a 90 degree elbow and flex line to where the
shutoff valve goes.  Now comes the challenge.  I want to install a electric
solenoid shutoff valve in place of the manual one.  Why you ask?  I want the
accumulator to perform two functions.  It will act as a pressure back up for
sweeping turn oil starvation and will be a pre oiler for engine starting.  We
will wire the solenoid into the ignition switch.  When the ignition is turned
off the valve will close and hold the oil pressure in the accumulator.  When the
key is turned on to start, the oil pressure will be released thus pre
pressurizing the oil system before the engine cranks.  As 90 percent of engine
wear comes when the engine is first started, this should make the engine last a
few more miles.

As for parts, my engine builder is making up a list of the various AN fittings
and lines.   He also has a remote oil filter mount as he feels the stock oil
filter should be bigger.  Jerry Woods also mentioned a System One oil filter
that we are looking into.  If you don't mind waiting a few weeks or more while
we do some R & D, I will let you know what we come up with.  If it works like we
plan and is real trick, my builder will probably put a kit together.
