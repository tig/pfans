Hi all,

Here is a list of used parts suppliers for those who may be looking for 
parts and really don't want to pay those "new" prices. Certain items 
should not be purchased used. Following is a brief list. 

water hoses
water pumps
belts
shocks
wheel bearings
CV joints
Fuel injectors
most window seals
gaskets
motor mounts
brake shoes & pads
Oxygen sensors
Clutch & brake master/slaves unless rebuilt
ignition components (wires etc.)
heater valves
brake lines
valves & valve springs
Pistons seperate from block
brake components that have been lying around exposed to atmosphere

Many items listed above can be avoided using common sense.
For expensive items, check on the age and mileage.(ie.engines)
Also check exacty what parts you need, not all parts are interchangeable 
for all the 944 years, not to mention differences with 944S & turbo's. 
Some parts have been updated and replaced, do your homework here! 

Great deals can be found on cosmetic parts, body panels & loose body 
parts (mirrors etc.), exhaust components (inspect these carefuly for 
cracks and stress, try for some sort of gaurantee from the parts 
supplier), wheels (make sure they are true), seats, lights (all), car 
stereo components (watch out for those old speakers), instruments (gauges 
etc.), electric motors (these are real expensive new), brakes & parts, 
driveshafts & transaxles, radiators (beware, another warranty item), 
alternators & starters, carpets, rear hatches and hardware, flywheels, 
glass (try to avoid windshields), wiring harnesses & components. more. 
more.

Great deals can be found especially on cosmetic items (watch out for 
condition and interior color).

Many used parts can be found listed in the back of Panorama and 
excellence magazines under parts for sale. Call around for best prices, 
it is amazing what a couple of phone calls can do.
I hope this helps for those list members who are upgrading and replacing 
needed parts on their "new" 944's.

Below is a list of used parts suppliers ( The usual disclaimers are in
