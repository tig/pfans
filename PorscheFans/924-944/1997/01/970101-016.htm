ok, I can tell you a little about this. First of all, a 968 has about 30 hp
more than a S2, but it a much better power band. The 968 has a variable cam
and this gives it a flatter power band and makes it much more drivable around
town. As for the 968 vs. the 944 turbo they are very simililar in power. The
944 turbo is faster in some areas, but overall a stock 968 vs. a stock turbo,
the 968 will be a little faster around a track (equall drivers assumed)
because of the flatter power band. the turbo has nothing at the lower rpms.
the 968 feels like it has nothing there, but the turbo really has nothing.
Now, the turbo will be older, and you will have to be more carefull about
maitenance, however there is MUCH much more you can do to a turbo to add
power. The 968 is normally aspirated. you can add a chip, and better air
intake, exaust, but you wont be able to do a shit load without a lot of
money. the turbo is much easier to boost power. if you are not planning on
adding a lot, I would get the 968 (I have one), but if you want to keep going
on the car, you can get 400 HP out of a turbo...If there is anything else I
can help you with let me know - Doug
