Jeff,
The KLR is one of the two chips in the DME (Computer) that are in a box
under the passenger seat. The KLR is the chip that senses knock and
controls boost (I think). Mine cost $400 used from Oklahoma Foreign ( a
local P-car dismantler that advertizes in Excellence and Pano). The first
KLR I got from them was also bad. You need a source that will take it back
if it doesn't solve the problem. My shop did the work and made the
arrangements for the used one, so I don't know how hard it is. I don't
think it is hard at all. Try George B. (944 Ecology) if you don't have a
local source. He is always a great help.
Good Luck,
MC 88 951 OKC OK USA
