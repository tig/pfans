	Henrik,

	There are lots of great shops in California. Some list members who
	are residents of said state can steer you to the right one for
	you. You might want to rethink letting a car wash handle the 
	cosmetics of your car. My suggestion is do it yourself. You care
	about the car more than anyone else so you'll be motivated to
	do the best job possible. If I remember correctly, the Sacremento
	Valley Web Page has some tips on paint car and the like. I can't
	remember the URL off the top of my head but Mike Willis knows it.
	Mike?
