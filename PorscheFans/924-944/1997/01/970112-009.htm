In the interest of cost, I would advise you to sell your car and purchase
a 944 Turbo, '88 TS or later.  That way, you would be starting out with
247 HP instead of your current 158.  Then, begin with the usual upgrades. 
Replace the DME ROMs, free flow exhaust, hotter cam, etc.  Remember, with
the increased speed, you need to upgrade tires, brakes, and the suspension
system.  Porsche did that at the factory with the Turbo..  wider tires,
4-piston calipers, stiffer anti-roll bars, limited slip differential, etc.
Seeing from past articles posted here, 400HP is available if you are 
willing to pay.

Folks on this list have advised people who want faster cars to first 
exploit what they have, and do a driving school.  The 944 is one of the 
best handling cars on the planet, and it's a shame to let that quality go to 
waste in search of power.  Otherwise, we would have bought American V8 
muscle cars..  ;-)

Gregor - 89 944 2.7.  162HP.
