Hi Rafael,

Though I've done alot of reading about these cars and try to make mental 
notes about the experience of others, I'm simply not experienced enough 
myself to give you an idea of where your car ought to be in terms of 
mpg.  Perhaps George B. would comment (I'm very interested myself).  I 
did feel obligated to at least say something because, I grant you, 40mpg 
is extraordinary for any car that isn't a Geo with 3 cylynders.  

Firstly, I'm no longer "Billy Bad-ass" on the road (though I did have a 
blast with a 400 big-block as a teenager).  These days I'm a very 
circumspect defensive driver.  I'm the sort who begins to gently brake 
the moment I see a light turn red.  No jack-rabbit starts, etc..  

Secondly, and more important in light of my quoted numbers, I do drive a 
ton of highway miles and the car, as do all cars in my opinion, seems to 
like this.  

Third, I've spent the last 5 years doing a study on the gas available in 
my area and found astonishing differences.  I don't mean to state the 
following as fact. My little notebook and year end tallies obviously 
don't equal lab results or anything.  However, I have observed that 
octane rating is not at all an indicator of "goodness".  For example, 92 
octane gas in my 89 Nissan Sentra results in obvious engine knock and 
miserable fuel economy in the 24-26mpg range.  89 octane in the same 
car, however, results in smooth running and an average of 37-38mpg.  
Brand of gas has also shown itself to be important.  I'm currently 
having a good experience with Shell.

Routine maintenance can contribute alot.  With 313000 miles on my 944, I 
can tell you she's got me well trained and on a short leash. :)
Plugs properly gapped.  Clean oil.  Distributor and wires in pristine 
condition.  Clean oil.  Did I mention clean oil?

Lastly, I would say the surest way to moderate (not eliminate) your 
spirited driving is to keep a notebook in your glovebox and figure your 
mileage everytime you fill.  Too many low figures in a row will begin to 
eat their way into your conscious mind while driving.
Experiment.  Take lots of short notes in the same tablet.
