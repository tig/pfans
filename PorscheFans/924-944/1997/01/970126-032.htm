I'm not sure it is "extreme" overkill to change the oil in a 911 every 3500
miles, but it seems as though the 3000-3500 mile change recommendation (some
argue that even this is too frequent) is based on an average quantity of
contaminent build up (acids, etc.) over time. This milage figure would be
based on a certain quantity of oil. In other words, if 3000 miles produced a
parts per million (PPM) contaminent concentration of say 100 in a 944 (5.5
quarts of oil), then unless some gross difference exists in how another
motor produces the same type(s) of contaminents, an engine that holds twice
the oil (11 quarts as for a 911) would have a PPM concentration of half that
that (50) of the motor with the smaller oil capacity. This being true, the
oil change interval (given normal driving) could be twice as long (6000-7000
miles) with both engines receiving equal exposure to contaminants.  Just my
thoughts.
