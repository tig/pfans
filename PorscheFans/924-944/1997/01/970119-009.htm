Driving my 944 out of the garage I hit a patch of ice under one wheel. It
is about 30 degrees here in Washington state, the kind of weather where a
thin layer of water accumulates over ice and makes it difficult to stand
still, much less drive.

With a factory-installed limited slip I wasn't too worried imagining that
one wheel with traction would be enough to get the car over the small
patch of ice under the other wheel. No such luck. The wheel with traction
stood still while the other did its best to wear out my Dunlop snow
tires spinning away.

I changed my transmission fluid recently, and I am pretty sure the limited


slip works (both wheels move in the same direction). In any case this is
a mechanical ltd. slip with very little that can go wrong, no fancy
torsion sensors.

Why did one wheel slip while the other sat still? Does the operation of
the limited slip have anything to do with vehicle speed?
