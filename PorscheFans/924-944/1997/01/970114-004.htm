Hello P-Fans,

I have two questions:

1.  What is the proper method for starting my 944 on a cold winter
morning?  Is it good for the car to allow it to warm up for awhile prior to
driving it or should I just get in, start it up and drive?

2. The reason for question 1 is that I allowed my car to warm up this
morning and next thing I know, the car starts to sputter and then stalled. 
When I tried to start the car, it acted as if the battery was completely
dead and wouldn't even turn over.  If I let the car set for a few minutes, it
would try to start and then nothing.  I decided to give it a jump start and it
worked.  However, if I let the car idle to long, it would sputter again and
stall.  Finally, after I jump started the car the second time, I had to get in
the car right away and take off.  Now everything is O.K.  I've had the car
for a year now and this only happened to me one other time but then I
had the timing belt, water pump, balance shaft belt, etc  replaced and it
never happened again until this morning.  

I find it hard to believe that it is my battery because the car started right
up this morning without a problem.  I would appreciate any insights to
what the problem may be.

Thanks
Karl
