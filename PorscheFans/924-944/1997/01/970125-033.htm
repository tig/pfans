Hi, Surya,

Probably what happened is that a small plastic gear inside the speedometer that drives
the odometer has cracked or broken.  This happened to a '79 924 and a '83 944 that I
used to own.  They both had the same type speedometer.  I've heard that this is common.
It's been a long time since I did the repairs, so the following steps may not be
entirely accurate, but they're close.

To fix it, you must, of course, remove the speedometer.  The plastic panel that houses
the speedometer is removed, but I can't remember exactly how the speedometer is attached
to the panel.  However, I don't think it's a very complicated setup.  (I'm afraid that
I can't remember if I removed the steering wheel or not, either, but you can try it with
the wheel attached and then remove it if necessary).

After removing the speedometer, the ring around the clear plastic face cover is removed.
I used a small screwdriver to pry up the back edge in small sections all the way around.
This is going to look really ugly, but it's on the back and will never be seen once
reinstalled.  Just be very careful not to alter the shape or the front surface of the
ring.  After the ring is removed, the speedometer can be disassembled.

Near the odometer wheels is a steel shaft which should have a small plastic gear fitted
on the end.  Your gear may still be on the shaft or it may be in two pieces somewhere
inside the housing.  I used 5-minute epoxy to reattach the gear to the shaft.  Use an
emory board to lightly roughen the surface of the shaft so the epoxy will adhere well.
Apply a very small amount of epoxy to the shaft and the gear pieces and reassemble the
gear pieces onto the shaft where it meshes with the odometer gear that it drives.  You
may have to hold the pieces in place while the epoxy cures.  I would also apply some
extra epoxy to the outside surface of the gear where it meets the shaft, if possible, to
add extra strength.

After the epoxy cures, reassemble the speedometer.  I believe I used the same
screwdriver that I used to remove the face cover ring to bend the back of the ring back
down.  Again, work a small section at a time and be very careful and it won't be visible
from the front.

Now, just reinstall the speedometer and you should be in business.  Like I said, I had
to do this to two cars and the odometers were still working when I sold them.  I hope
this works for you.
