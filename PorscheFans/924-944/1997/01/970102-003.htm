Hi Michael,

That sounds like an outstanding purchase at an outstanding price.  I would
love to divest both of my cars and get a deal like that.  Let me know if
you change your mind.

The 968, as claimed in Excellence, December 1992, makes good use of the 6
speed transaxle by strategically placing second gear such that an up shift
from first gear (at 6000 rpm) will translate to 3750 rpm in second gear.
The end result is landing right on the sweet spot of the torque curve and
the next shift point into third puts you at 64 mph.  The end result is a
quick ride to 60 mph.

I have also heard of a number of conversions where turbo owners put the 6
speed transaxle and support components in their cars for track use.

All three Excellence articles agree with judgement about the 968 as well.


Marv (1987 944 & 1987 944S)
