This sounds like a problem common to aged throttle switches in other
applications, and it would make sense that it could happen to the 
electronic part of your air flow sensor.   This is the part under the black
plastic cover.   It consists, among other things, of a circuit board with
contacts driven by the motion of the moving "door" in the intake.   If the
circuit pathways upon which the contacts ride wear out, you will begin 
to get symptoms like this.   Very common in Japanese cars with throttle
switches which perform some similar functions.

The real fly in the ointment is that it always happens at a speed/rpm at 
which the car is driven a lot, because  that's where the contacts find
themselves much of the time.

I have not seen one (throttle switch) give trouble over such a wide rpm
range, but Murphy rules.

Let us know what you really find.

Good luck.

Dave
