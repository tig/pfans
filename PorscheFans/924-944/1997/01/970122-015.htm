This is a normal sequence of events for a synchronizer failure.  You will
be able to get around it for a while by double clutching, and perhaps using
one of the synthetic gearbox lubes, but, sadly, the inevitable outcome is
a transmission rebuild.

>unless you go for a really quick change under fast acceleration.

This is NOT a good idea in any Porsche gearbox and can cause the
problems outlined above.

Factory manual is the only way to go.   Hard copy or microfiche.

Good luck, Kevin.
