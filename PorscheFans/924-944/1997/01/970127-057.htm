The car actually had the MAF as well as a K27.  The K27 is the reason
the car was flat until at least 5000rpm and then it surged quite nicely,
but until then, it was a real dog.

The best thing to do with this mod is to max everything else out first,
K27, 2.8L motor, etc, etc, and then pick on up used.  Someone just emailed
me that one of the P-car mags has a person selling one for US$1000 from
an 86 Turbo.  If you try it and don't like it, I'm sure you can re-sell
it for the same money to someone else who wants to try it.

What, you don't drive the car in the cold?  Don't you know, turbos LOVE cold
weather.  The air is denser, the I/C cools better, the explosion in the
combustion chamber is more intense, everything works in your favour.  I'm
just bugging you.  I drive my car year round, even in the snow, but the cold
weather makes the car almost lag-free.  I'll hate it when summer comes 
around again :(  But then I can do those mountain blasts with the windows
down and the sunroof open.  Actually, I drive with the windows down even
in -10 C temps.  It's been six months now, and I still haven't found the need
for a stereo so my car still has no stereo, just throttle controlled
exhaust noise :) and that turbo whistle.

Farzaan.
