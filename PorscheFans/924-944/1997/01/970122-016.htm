     Remember the "Crude Rule":
        If the oil companies felt that it was good thing they would include 
     it in their product.
     
     I do not know about negative long term effects with synthetics other 
     than the original stuff was junk, but "they've come a long way baby" 
     with today's synthetic.  Everything I have heard about synthetic was 
     good, and it was designed to readily mix with standard oils.
     
     Always change your oil at regular intervals regardless of type.  
     Synthetics may take longer to break down, but the combustion 
     byproducts in the engine oils are acidic and must be purged at the 
     3,000 - 3,500 mile interval, or 3 - 4 months, whichever comes first.
