	Can't answer this one, I haven't had to do it since...(see
	#2 below)

	Yes, get the turbo motor mounts. The PO on my car
	replaced the orginal motor mounts with turbo mounts
	so I haven't had this problem (fortunetly).

	I think you should do it asap. I remember reading a couple
	messages on here where the owner waited awhile to replace the
	bad mounts and the vibration ended up causing him some
	major engine problems. Can anyone else confirm this?
