A tip regarding brakes for cars with four pot calipers.

On my '87 951, I installed Turbo S front brakes from an '89 (which I wrecked, 
unfortunately in 1995).  About six months after I made the conversion, I began 
to notice a major decrease in performance.  I had done 2-3 track events (two 
drivers-- myself and my wife), and a bunch of autocrosses in this time period.

The brakes felt perpetually soft, despite frequent and careful bleeding.  I 
changed to stainless lines, and experimented with a variety of pad materials, 
but the result was always the same.  I tried 2-3 bleeding methods, including 
pressure bleeding and vaccuum bleeding with my Mityvac tool.  I sought advice 
from many expert mechanics.  I even changed out the master cylinder.

Several times during the 9 month period of frustration I thought I had the 
probllem licked, but as son as I'd get into an AX or track event, I'd quickly 
find out that I still had a problem.  Several buddies drove the car in AX 
events and they thought the brakes were just not working right.  The problem 
was somewhat intermittant on the track, making it difficult to use consistent 
braking points, which led to some interesting situations in traffic...

The lack of firmness was especially noticeable when I'd compare it with my '89 
951 (replacement for the wrecked unit).  I tried to figure out how ABS (the 
only difference between the two cars' braking systems) could cause the brakes 
to behave differently.

I finally decided to pay someone to swap out the booster, even though everyone 
said that the units just don't fail.  Since the problem was related to pedal 
pressure, I figured that this was the last resort.  There is no way to check 
whether a booster has a "partial failure."  Anyway, I was of course wrong about 
the booster.  Did not solve the problem.

I finally came to the conclusion that I might have sticking caliper pistons.  I 
had thought about this previously, but as the brakes came off my wrecked '89 
with only 32k miles I figured "not likely."  Well my problem seems to be cured.  
After I swapped out all four pots in each caliper (you can't get just seals for 
these calipers-- you have to buy the pots with them) I noticed the difference 
before I took the car down off of the jackstands.  Instant hard pedal.

The piston/seal kits are about $25-$35 (discounted price-- not List) each and 
available only from a dealer.  Although this rebuild was expensive (two 
calipers = 8 pots x $30), it seems to have done the trick.

What is particularly funny (sad) about this is the fact that I assumed the 
labor involved (~$800-900 worth) in the booster change was out of my league as 
a home mechanic.  Since that time, I've had the cylinder head off three times 
due to a gasket sealing problem.  Now I have the skill and experience in 
tearing the car apart and putting it back together, but not the $900!  Never, 
ever replace the booster until you are absolutely sure that the caliper pistons 
are working properly.  I've heard that these calipers are hard to bleed, but 
remember, I tried all of the tricks.  The new pistons seem to be the solution.
