As the owner of a beautiful metallic taupe 944, w/ 17 C2 turbo rims, I
have often been the target of sensless agression.

1. Someone tried to break in through quarter glass window;
	Nothing major just a new seal.

2. Someone tried to break in through quarter glass window again, and when
they didn't succeed tried to go through the sunroof....and when they
didn't succeed... took a screwdriver to the paint;
	Nothing major just ~ $5000.00 for some new sikkens 3 stage paint.

3. Fresh out of the body shop on a beautiful summer evening someone took
my emblem(funny that they didn't leave the slightest scratch) but they did
leave a lot of saliva.
	Nothing major just a new emblem (I think I will use velcro on this
one)

4. On a fine evening outside a downtown cafe (sunroof off of course). I
returned to find some sort of liquid all over the outside and inside of
the car. Good thing it was only cherry soda cause a bodily fluid
probably wouldn't of tasted so good.

I dont know what it is, but it seems that people have much more resentment
for Porsche drivers than any other Marquee I have driven. When I had a
1976 BMW 2002 TII people would stop me and talk to me about the car,
nothing in the '44,

Now that I have that off of my chest I will stop raving on and on....

Thanks for the B-With.

Anthony.

944 under a cover in the Garage where no one will harm it. too bad i sort
