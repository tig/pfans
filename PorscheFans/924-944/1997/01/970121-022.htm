	David,

	First off, is this a turbo or a non-turbo car? If it's
	non-turbo, I don't think it can be done. The car comes with
	168 hp (roughly) and you're talking about doubling that without
	the use of a turbo charger. It probably can be done, but you
	could find a 935 cheaper :) That said, if it is a turbo, you can
	get that 300 hp but it will be expensive to do the job right
	so that the engine will last. One modification to consider
	is the 2.8l Andial Stroker Kit (available from Andial, duh).
	Keep in mind that any mods you make should involve
	some serious engine work. Chips are nice and may produce some
	power gains but they have their very definite problems and
	are not the way to go in my book (by themselves anyway). You
	should probably find yourself a good (preferably great) Porsche
	shop and talk to them about what they'd do. But keep in mind it's
	in their best interest for you to spend your money :) Let us know
	what you do...
