Hi All,
I don't have an e-mail program where I can easily copy text I want to
comment about, so just consider this part of the thread about club raing.  
        I think club racing is the best thing ever to come out of PCA.
Because of it I've been able to drive as hard as I can at Sebring, Road
Atlanta, Road America, Brainerd Intl, Heartland Park, Putnam Park, Second
Creek, Pocono, and Mid Ohio. And more tracks are becoming available every
year.  To keep costs down I do virtually all my own preparation , so I know
my Porsche a lot better than BCR (before club racing). Best of all I'm a
much better driver than BCR (but unfortunately not the next coming of
Senna).
        In 25 races I've never had an engine problem (that's one main
reason to stay in a stock class - assuming one has a truly stock engine as
the rules require) and I sure in heck have never gotten into a fight with
an official (whoever did that is a real STUPID guy) or another competitor. 
As a matter of fact there is a lot of comraderie and I've made a number of
friends I never would have met otherwise in club racing.
        The down side is I have had one incident of car damage when I spun
and backed into a wall at Heartbreak er Heartland Park. (I've subsequently
found out this isn't too unique  - there is a club of sorts whose members
proudly (?) wear their Heartland Park "Wallbangers Club" t-shirts.)  My 951
is licensed and believe it or not the Liberty Mutual auto insurance policy
contains No restriction whereby they don't pay if you're racing the car. 
So I even came out of that OK.
        My big beef which has been echoed by others here is the cheating in
stock classes.  The idea that the friendly racers would police themselves
was from the beginning totally naive on the part of the national
organizers.  The tone of the recent newsletters is that this will change
and the scrutineers will take some initiative to check the cars.  I really,
really hope this happens. Some of the stuff that got by at the races I've
attended was ridiculous.  If the car made weight not even clearly visible
non complience with the rules was questioned. We'll see what happens.
        I'm hoping to make the race at Sebring on  Feb 16 (it was -12 on
the thermometer here so FL sounds very good), but there's some things at
work that make that still a maybe.  Anybody else on this list going?
        BTW, I noted that Jerry cc'd one message to racing@PorscheFans.com.
 Is that another list that might be of interest to me?  If so could
somebody remind me how to subscribe to it.  Thanks
Lance Flynn '89 951 E Stock
