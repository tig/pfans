I saw this article in a recent Autoweek.  (Peeve: why must
automotive writers always compare the 944 against the 911?)

Forget conventional wisdom: Get a great deal

        I had just finished speaking to the MG club in Portland, Ore.,
    when an attractive young woman sidled up to me and whispered,
    ``I've got a terrible secret to tell you.''

        ``I've owned MGs for nearly all my driving life, and I race
    an E-Production MGB,'' she confided.  ``But exactly 29 days ago,
    I bought a Porsche 944.''

        ``It was cheap, it's faster than any English car I've ever
    owned, at least five times as comfortable, and probably 10 times
    as reliable.  Am I going soft?''

        Nah, you're just getting realistic.  At current prices ($5,000 
    to $9000 for good 1983-1989 coupes), the 944 offers more performance
    per dollar than nearly any other sports car.  That it is unloved
    by many collectors works to your benefit.  Most 356/911 owners
    have a blind, unswerving obedience to their rear-engined Beetles-
    on-steroids, and they present a resounding thumbs down to any car
    from Porsche that attempted to incorporate modern chassis technology.

        So don't worry if the 356/911 crowd turns up its collective rear-
    pointed nose when you drive by.  The 944 delivers quality, great
    handling and good performance -- or more sports car -- for less 
    money than anything else available today.
