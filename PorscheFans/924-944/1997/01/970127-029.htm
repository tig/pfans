	I wouldn't. I generally stick with a plan that has proved popular
	on here in some corners. Replace the water pump no matter what
	every *other* timing belt (at 60K, in other words).

	Only if you don't plan on driving it til then. Do not put any
	more miles on this car without doing the timing belt and checking
	the water pump. You could be very, very sorry.
