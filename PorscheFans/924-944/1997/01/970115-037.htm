Well, I've installed both a lower temp thermostat and a lower temp fan
switch, and I've been pretty happy with the results.  As I live in Atlanta,
and have to sit in rush hour traffic twice daily, the combination of these
two keeps my 944 running much cooler during the hot summer months (and hot
spring, and hot fall...;)
While it used to get towards the top of the temp scale in these conditions,
it now rarely gets above half way.  The only drawback I've had so far is
using this combination in the winter.  It's been much colder here that
usual (although not as bad as you guys up north are getting it), and this
tends to keep the car too cool.  I think that using the lower temp
thermostat in very hot weather is a good thing, but you might want to think
about switching back to a stocker in the winter.
