	Before I had my 87, I drove a 85 Toyota Ceclica with a 5 spd.
	There is no way I can overstate the difference between the
	transmissions on "normal" cars and the trans. on Porsches.
	It's like learning to drive all over again. I still haven't got
	it down right every time. That said, you might try experimenting
	with the way you're shifting. Even better, if you know an
	experienced Porsche owner, have him critique what you're doing.
	From the description you give above, I don't *think* you have
	a serious problem just yet.

	This is an entirely normal sound. It can be alleviated to
	a degree by using Swepco in the trans. rather than the 
	OEM oil.

	Hehehe...in Texas, it's like being asked to Draw! at every
	intersection by every knucklehead that owns a Mustang, Camaro,
	3000 GT, etc. Like I'd even rev above 2500 rpms for those
	jokers...
