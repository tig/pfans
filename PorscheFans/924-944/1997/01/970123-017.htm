	Hehehe...Steve, you're not going to like this; until recently,
	I drove my 87 944 as a daily driver. I work a ways away from my
	home so a lot of this time is spent on the highway so mileage has
	always been good (around 28mpg highway and city combined).
	Unfortunetly, I put 50K on my car in 20 months doing this and
	it cost me; I spent about $7500 in maintenance during that time.
	The things that went wrong with my car in no particular order
	are: water pump, sunroof gears, leaking radiator, oil cooler
	seals, clutch, steering rack, tires, a/c switch (that bugger's
	expensive!), thermofan switch, etc. As you can see, it's
	basically a laundry list of all the big ticket items that go
	wrong with 944's. So, if you do make it your daily driver, be
	aware what can happen if you start slapping lots of miles on
	it.
