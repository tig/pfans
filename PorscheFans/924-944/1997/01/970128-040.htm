I had rattling problem with my factory muffler.  Found out the whole
factory exhaust system from tip to and include cat. converter would cost me
more than C$1,800 and a close alternative (ANSA) at C$1,000 plus labour, I
turned to Proformance, a local performance car shop which primarily
specializes in N. Amercian cars, for advice.  I was advised of the
Aero-Master high flow muffler using  which they had experience in gaining
HP for many local cars.  I took the risk as it's much cheaper C$130
(material only) and its a stainless steel unit.  With that saving, I then
bought a 4" stainless steel resonator tip, had my cat. converter replaced
with a pipe resonator, and had the entire exhaust piping upto cat.
converter replaced according to original spec.  The result, undesirable
sluggishness at low end while free flow at mid & high end rpm.  The car is
now with deep sound at idle and low rpm and actually quieter at mid & high
rpm.  Despite the feeling and sound, there is no noticeable HP nor speed
improvement although it cures the rattling problem.

I don't have any experience in the turbo and know not a lot about it.  I
cannot advise you with any degree of accuracy but I suppose what you
suggest is natural.  For normal aspirated cars like my 944, I think the key
is not "restrictive" but is "tuned".  Porsche always has a very exacting
spec for its components.  This may be the reason why many Porsche
enthusiasts have resisted the temptation to buy cheaper generics.  Having
tried so many aftermarket products that claimed guaranteed improvement and
saving, I begin to trust factory products more than aftermarkets, if budget
allows.

No.  Anthony, are you an owner of a 944?
