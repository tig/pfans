There are a couple of fairly common tools that make this job easy (easier):
1) a cotter key puller 2) a rolling wedge bar (sometimes called a "hooked
tool"). The latter is generally best, comes in varying sizes, and can
usually be found near the punches and chisels in a well stocked tool
department (e.g. - Sears). In an emergency, a pair of vice grips and a bolt
(carriage, hex head, etc) turned around backward sometimes works. A file can
be used on the underside of the bolt head to broduce a small slot which
helps grip the edge of the seal.
