Hi Otto,

I think the fans will engage while moving.  I have seen it on my old '84
car, and I think I have seen it on my 87 cars.  That should actually
increase cooling.

You can test the operation of the fans by remaining stationary and listen
for the fans to start and note the temperature gauge.

Do you have heat from the heater?  What, if any, changes in outside
temperatures have taken place?  Your cooling system might have air in the
system.  I have heard gurgling sounds from mine when I start the car and
had air in the system.  When that happened the temperature gauge read high.

Maybe there is a partially stuck thermostat.  What is your antifreeze
concentrate level?  This is probably normal if you replaced the water pump
14 months ago.  Then again, if during the replacement, some debris got
loose (coolant thrombosis!) in the system, maybe it found a home some place
it shouldn't be.

Bottom line: the temperature is still not in the worry zone, yet.  It might


not be anything to worry about.

Marv
