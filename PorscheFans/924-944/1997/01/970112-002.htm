Hi Walt,
I also have the "poor man`s Porsche" being short of a few sheckles### meself.
The car is vastly underated and in my opinion has better lines than the
944`s steroid look. I had a similar high and surging idle which was
corrected by new injectors and a 02 adjustment by a local Bosch garage (the
motor was running way too lean). My car is an "82, Euro spec. 125 bhp
version, has covered 150k miles! I have covered 25,000 hard driving miles,
just checked valve clearance perhaps for the first time, no adjustment
needed! Car starts cold at 6 to 8 bar depending on outside temperature and
lowers to 2 or 3 bar at hot idle, up to 6 bar under load. Water temperature
does not rise above half way on dial unless there is a problem. When the
cold waether started this winter, -15 C. temp. raised to red and no hot air
from heater. Fitted new thermostat and enough anti-freeze for -50 C. no
problems since.

How do we get more power from our practical, dependable 924`s?

I asked the same question to "The Porsche Shop" in the UK and was advised
the following:
a)      Straight through middle exhaust box with 944 rear box.
b)      K&N air filter.
c)      Adjustable fuel head.
d)      Larger carburator body.
e)      Performance cam (out of stock! no name, sorry)
I have no personal experience of any gains achievable with these
modifacations and would be grateful to hear from anyone who does!

On a different note I used to own a Saab 99 turbo which went like stink and
was great fun. I imagine the 944 turbo must offer more of the same boost
fever! How does the 944 compare with the turbo version, performance and
dependability (expense!) wise? The boost effect and the constand whine on
the 99 added to the whole experience but generally everything wore out quick
and was difficult to get to. Comments?

There is an article in the "Gold Portfollio" series on the 924 about a
supercharged 924!  Apparently the kit was and perhaps still is manufactured
in the US (where else). Where can I get one....

my 2 kroner...
Iain
