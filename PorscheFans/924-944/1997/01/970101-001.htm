The 928 wheels will not fit on pre 87 cars without spacers.  They will be
offset about 55 mm to the inside of the car.  Even if they do not rub on
the suspension, and they will, it will look like a '66 Chevy Impala without
the spacers.  The 87 and later cars can use them, but they are still about
10 mm shy of the correct spacing.  I use a set of 928 wheels on my '87 944
and it works, but for you, you need to factor the cost of the spacers and
wheels together for your car.

As a side note, I got much better handling out of my car when I switched
from the stock 15" wheels and went with 16" with the 205 X 55 fronts and
225 X 50 tires on the rears.  16" wheels are a good idea fro better road
holding.

Good luck,


Marv (1987 944 & 1987 944S)
