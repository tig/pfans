     Having just picked up my dream car, a red 944S2 Cab from 1990 with 
     51.000 miles on it and an immaculate appearance, I am now looking for 
     places that can keep it in it's current condition. I live in Newport 
     Beach, CA aand have (so far) chosen the local Porsche Dealer (Newport 
     Auto on PCH) to do the maintenance. Does anyone on the list live in 
     Orange County and have experience with this place or other service 
     places in OC? I also plan to have a car wash take care of the cosmetic 
     side of the car. Can anyone recommend a place in OC? I would like to 
     find a place that knows how to treat this kind of car (i.e. use the 
     right liquids on the top, care for the clearcoated wheels in the 
     proper way, etc.)
     
     I know this request may be a little out of the ordinary, but I was 
     hoping that someone on the list could provide me with some valuable 
     advice.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Henrik Frank
     In Newport Beach, where I wish it would stop raining so I could take 
     my car out for a spin :-)
