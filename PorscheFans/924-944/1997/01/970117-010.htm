I am seriously considering the purchase of a 1994 968 coupe.  If I buy
it, it will be my first Porsche.

I have been looking more for a 911, but I really need a car that I can
drive all year round (in New Hampshire) and sit in all too frequent
traffic jams during my commute.  For this reason the 968 came to mind.
I like the look of it better than the 944 (no offense to your 944
lovers).

Is this car expensive to maintain?  I now drive a 1990 BMW 735i and I'm
assuming that parts/labor will be about the same.  Is this correct?

Any oddball gotchas to look out for?

The clutch in this car seems to grab close to the top of the pedal
travel. Is this a sign of wear, of a necessary adjustment, or the nature
of the beast?  It didn't slip at all on me.

At what interval should the timing belt be changed?

Do you 968 owners have trouble finding parts?  I've looked through
excellence magazine and Panorama and most after market parts places have
parts for 911,924,944, and 928.  I know that lots of parts for the 968
are the same as a 944S2, but the ads specifically say 944 and have year
range ending at 91.

Finally, the price on this car is $28,950.  It has 39K miles, leather
seating surfaces, and 17inch wheels.  I'm not sure yet about the LSD.
Cosmetically its in excellent shape and from the drive I took it seems
mechanically sound as well.  The price includes a 1 year unlimited
mileage warranty from Porsche.  The salesman is trying to stick to the
price but I won't pay more than $28,000.  Is this a reasonable price, or
too high.

Thanks for any info!
