I'm trying to fix a couple of minor "cosmetic" problems without
resorting to paying the dealer an exorbitant amount of money.

Both of the supports for the glove box cover have broken and
can't be repaired.  Since it's "safety equipment", you have to
replace the entire cover at a cost of $700.  My interior's
burgundy.  Does anyone know where I can get another one for
less?

The support (that holds the hooks) for the luggage cover has
also broken.  It's snapped in the two obvious weak points where
the hooks screw in.  I've replaced the support once already.
(At the time I had a friend who could do plastics fabrication.)
Does anyone know of some clever soul who makes them out of
aluminum so they won't keep breaking?  Oh yeah, I lost one
of the hooks this last time around, so I need another one of
those too.  Of course, the dealer's solution is to replace the
entire luggage cover.

TIA,

Katherine L. Morse (KLM)
