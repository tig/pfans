My 1988 944S has developed a strange problem. Though I'm not sure that it's
really even
a problem....yet. Lately I've noticed the temp gauge reads a little warmer
then it should be with winter (40 degree) weather. It always seemed to run a
little above the first mark (about the 8:30 position). Now sometimes, but
not all the time, the gauge reads about the 9:00 to 9:30 position. Not real
hot, but hot enough to run the fan.
This happens both on the freeway (50-80 mph) or while I'm putzing around
town. Which leads me to believe that the fan is coming on while I'm at
speed. Though I'm not ruling out the water pump it is only 14 months old
with only about ten thousand mile on it.
The coolant level has not dropped any, nor does there seem to be any coolant
in the oil or vica versa. Could a sticking thermostat cause this? Seems to
me if a thermostat
was stuck closed the engine would overheat but the coolant traped in the
radiator would
be nice and cool, thus showing a normal or slightly cooler reading on the
temp gauge.
 How about a fan that comes on at to low a temp? Would this cause enough
disruption in the air flow through the radiator at spped to actually keep it
from cooling?

  Thanks
