My '84 944 has had one new water pump in its 100k mile history. Never had
a cooling problem, and the temp gauge never moves past quarter gauge, in
110 degree east Washington weather. I have a low temp thermoswitch and the
fans kick in early, but no, the fans are nto supposed to work at highway
speeds, except with the a/c working. I have noticed a remarkable
consistency in the cooling cycle of my 944, be it winter or summer the fan
kicks in at similar intervals, and on the freeway the temperature is
always at a quarter, and the fan never works (except with the a/c on).

I would advise Otto to check the thermostat and the thermoswitch (by
jumping or shorting them), and consider low-temp versions of both.
