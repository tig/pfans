I have been reading the oil question. I change my oil every 3k miles or
three months. I drive about 8500 miles a year on my 951. I use synthetic
but my question is what weight should I use. Currently I use 5-50. I live
in California weather is approx. 50 to 80 with 100's in the summer for
about 2 weeks. Is 5-50 to light for the turbo or is the 50 to heavy. I 
know the viscosity is based on the outside temp, but to the engine the 
outside temp is the engine compartment. Thanks for the help.

Gas Smell

I had the same problem on my 944 85.5. I purchased the car from the 
dealer as a demo unit. It had 7500 miles on it. I smelled gas on cold days
and in the mornings. The odor came from the passenger side next to the
window at the vent openings.
I returned the car many times. They always looked 
and said they repaired it, But it was the same. I asked to see the records
for the car which they kept. It turns out they had the same problem during
the demo period. (dealers wife drove the car). They had replaced the
fuel tank,but it did not help. As always when you what to have something
fixed you have to do it yourself. 

Solution: (For my Car)

The fuel tank is connected to the filler opening by way of a large diameter
hose. The hose is the cloth covered rubber type. The hose was wet on the 
outside indicating leaking through the rubber. When I went to the dealer
to order the hose the, exploded view of the tank assembly showed two rubber 
gaskets on the top and bottom of the filler hose. Since the dealer had 
relaced the tank they did not replace the gaskets. Also because they had 
replaced the tank it was easy for me to get to everything. You have to 
remove the carpet,also the rear quarter panel and window. The hose is 
incased in a metal screwed on plate. There are also gasket around the 
plate. During this whole experience I because an expert on the emmisions 
system. I had purchased almose every hose and I was going to replace the 
charcoal canister. I don't think the gas system is a "closed " system. 
The fuel tank fumes go to the charcoal canister to be scrubed then vented. 
Take a look at the emmisions system sticker in the engine compartment it is
very helpful. I hope this helps.
