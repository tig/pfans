Hi, George B.,

Could I also have the same problem?  With the car up on jack stands, I was disassembling 
for a clutch replacement.  To rotate the drive shaft so as to get to the transmission 
coupler, I tried turning a wheel.  The wheel on the other side turned the opposite 
direction without turning the drive shaft.  According to a recent post (I forget who), 
this would indicate no limited slip.  I got the drive shaft to turn by holding one wheel 
while my assistant turned the other wheel by hand (no tools used to do the turning).

My car is the '88 silver rose Turbo S and, according to the Service Information Technik 
manual for this car, limited slip was standard equipment.  The numbers stamped into the 
top of the transmission case are AOR 04117 indicating that this is the correct 
transmission for the car and was built on 4 November, 1987 which would be about right.

Given that the transmission seems fine otherwise, do you think that the limited slip is 
gone?  If so, is this a do-it-yourself repair or will it require a professional? Any 
idea on the cost?

Thanks.

Mike Fields
