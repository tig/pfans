I have an '88 924S which I just bought last summer.  90K, and real good
condition.  I spent the summer and fall just enjoying the car and becomming
familiar with it, and now I'm ready to do a little minor fixing and
tampering.

With the arrival of the cold weather, I have noticed that the valves sound
noisy until the engine has been run and warmed up completely, although there
are no performance problems.  I wrote of this problem on the Porche Chat
Board of the POC, and got one response telling me to switch to a lighter oil.
 The gentleman then said anybody that ever runs 20w50 in a water cooled
Porsche is a "dickhead" (sorry).  Figuring it couldn't hurt, I did change the
oil to Valvoline 5w30 (with purolator filter), and surprisingly, that made
absolutely no difference in the noisy cold valves.  I'm planning on leaving
that in until about late February, and then upping to Castrol 10w40 on a
permanent basis.  Since I'm new to this 944 engine, I would be interested in
some opinions on the following:

1.  What do you make of the noisy cold valves?
2.  I read somewhere that you should only use a Porshe oil filter with this
car.  Any truth to that?
3.  What about the oil?  Should I revert back to Castrol 20w50 in the summer?
 Is 5w30 too light?  I live in Baltimore, and we do have some cold days here
in the winter, but I don't drive the car that often (usually just weekends),
and never in the snow/ice.

Thanks.
Ed
