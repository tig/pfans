Hi P-fans,
I am new to the list and a new and very happy Porsche 951 owner. My
question is can anyone recommend a reputable, reasonably priced shop on
Long Island (preferably out east).
Before I purchased the car I had it checked out by the the local Porsche
dealer (also the dealer where the previous owner serviced the car)...and
everything was fine. I then had it checked a second time by my current
shop (recommended by a friend of a friend with a 911) and they found a
small leak by the waterpump. After looking into the leak they found the
cause of the problem was a hose clamp on the bypass hose. All the belts
checked out fine and they didn1t suggest replacing any...to my relief
the waterpump was the updated part.
Here is were my paranoia sets in. After that service the 951 (by the way
with 72,000 miles) has developed some other problems. A cooling fan
switch which would not shut off was replaced. At that service the
ignition wires were said to be shorting and should be replaced. I again
complied. I now hear a small vibration from the left rear (muffler area)
as the turbo spools which they claim to be backpressure, but I do not
remember ever hearing such a vibration before. The heat, which seemed to
be working fine, is now blowing cold air when the car sits idle, warm
when cruising. I also have heard a large rush of water under the
passenger side footwell when starting the car after it was cold. Both of
these problems started at the same time. Last, but certainly not
least...at 80mph in both 4th and 5th gear I have experience what my shop
calls misfiring. The car begins to buck as if the fuel supply has been
cut. It does not happen when cruising, only when accelerating.
Am I nuts? Or does this seem excessive for a car that checked out fine
at 71,000.
I am not implying any foul play on the part of my current shop. They are
reasonably priced, friendly, eager to please and I genuinely like them.
However, I would just like to have an option, like someone who
specializes only in Porsches and knows a great deal about 9441s.
Any recommendations, advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
Eddie
