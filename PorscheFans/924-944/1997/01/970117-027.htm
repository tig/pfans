Yeah, to me trailers should not be an issue. We have recently bought an
X-Winston cup trailer to go racing with,(like kelly moss) now in outward
appearence it would seem like stupidly exspensive but the actual idea behind
it was to provide a way to keep from missing so much work and help defer
some of the cost of getting to race in that we can haul 3 others racers cars
to the same race with us thereby generating revenue and providing a way for
3 other guys to fly n drive that otherwise could not go because the guys who
haul cars for a living are too exspensive ;-)

I am WAAAAAAAYYYYYY green right now ;-)

  I don't buy into this completely because even if you do have all that
suspension stuff (we dont), you still have to drive the car.  Example: last
month at Sears a fella named Scott Peeler won driving a basicly stock C2 on
tires borrowed from another competitor! Although now that I think of it, I
think he had too big of rims on that car. That is a good question because he
borrowed Darryl Troesters 17" wheels off a turbo S, would those be 9" & 10"
or the required 8" & 9" for the C2? But he even had a stock seat in it!!
Ever try to hold yourself in a C2 on the track going as hard as you can with
a stock slippery non-sport seat? It aint fun. With no seat and no wing he
beat Ed Mineau (brown motored awsome euro sc), Bill Lusk in an RSA with an
RSR wing runnin at C2 weight (which is bullshit in my not so humble opinion)
on his home track. He also beat Tony Morelli (home track i think) and
another couple guys in 944 turbos that Larz Geirsing prepares and this is
most definitely thier home track.  How did he do it? I gotta vote pure
talent! Unless he was using cheater wheels ;-) but still out drove everyone
in the class.

 Philosophically I think stock class should be more like a spec
>class then what it is turning out to be. 

And we're the only ones that can change the rules but I have the feeling
they are already the way the majority want them. I happen to agree with you
and I think it would be better if you could truly buy a car stuff a bar in
it and go be competitive at the top of your ability, but given the current
allowences its not likely. I am hopin to go chase Busby in GTS2 ;-)

  It sounded to me like Harry and his gang of police are going to get
tougher next year and man oh man am I looking forward to it. I hate to drive
as far as I have to drive to race and feel like someone is finishing ahead
of me in a car that isn't right.
The only kind of person I despise more than people knowingly cheating is
theives!

   Yeah, it is pretty saddening isn't it? Ever seen that Turquiose car in G
with the clowns on it from Mn.? Ya know, the Grateful Dead car? Boy does
that car run good!! And both father and son drive the wheels off it!

Your turn.
