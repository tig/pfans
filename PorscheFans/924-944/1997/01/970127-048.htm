Well guys,

The time has finally come that my teammate can no longer drive his Talon :)
He's so jealous of the smooth suspension of the Turbo S that allows
precision positioning while not being ridiculously harsh.  Ever since
I beat him up a very long hill, he's been dreading an in-gear race :)
So, he finally caved in and has started the paperwork for a 944 Turbo S.

If everything goes as planned, he'll have it in his hands within 30 days.
If it works out, our team will once again be a one make and one model team.
I also have another friend who will be buying one at the end of summer.
See, I'm increasing the value of these cars by reducing the supply :)

One bad thing happened to me this weekend though.  I got my frist speeding
ticket in three years!  I was doing 75km/h in a 50km/h zone, so 25km/h
over the speed limit.  It was quite a funny ticket.  The reason why I
floored it around that bend was to hear the awesome exhaust note from
the concrete surrounding this particular road.  It sounded really good
until I saw the two police men who didn't appreciate my small tail out
slide in 1st gear.  The guy gave the ticket and did say I had a nice
car though, so it wasn't all bad.

A ticket every three years isn't so bad, is it?

I'm planning on coming down to the US on February 16, 1997 for an
autocross event at Bremerton.  We're meeting up with some Talon owners
down there, are there any Porsche owners that wanna show up?  We're 
bringing down a 944 Turbo, two 944 Turbo S's, and probably a 944 S2.

Farzaan.
