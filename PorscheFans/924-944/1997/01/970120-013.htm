<<  am not to sure of the 944 (non-turbo). I used to have one of those,but
 only needed it towed when it was killed by a hit and run driver. If you
every
 have to have it towed do not assume (ass out of you and me) the truck driver
 knows what he (or she) is doing. >>

David,   

  I couldn't help but notice that you mentioned your car was "killed by a
hit-and-run driver".    Is this just a Porsche thing or what???   My 944 has
been hit twice by hit-and-run drivers - once in front of a crowd of people...
 (I still have the side-mirror of the offending car - a Saturn I believe)

Is it that people just don't like our cars or is it they think their
insurance premiums will go through the roof if they hit a Porsche?

My 911 on the other hand has been vandalised twice (intentionally I would
assume) - but that was in Australia..  The means of vandalism was not so
pleasant in either case but in one of them involved bodily fluids...  I guess
seeing a Porsche 911 parked  in a public parking place must annoy some
people.

I am just intrigued to see if others in these groups have had similar
occurances with their Porsches...
