	I guess I'm guilty of being vague in my assertations. I didn't
	mean to imply there's _no_way_ to get that much power out of
	a 951. What I meant to say exactly is there's no cheap, easy
	fix to get that much power reliably and for any length of
	time. You don't just pop a chip in there, add some sort of nifty,
	heated intake thingy, crank the boost way up there, and zoom
	away. If you do that, you're headed for trouble. To get that
	much power (reliably and for the long term), you need to make
	serious engine modifications i.e. the Andial stroker kit (Barry
	just mentioned this a few days ago) or have your engine
	professionally built like you're doing. I think we're
	sort of saying the same thing but just didn't realize it.
	Hopefully, I cleared this up...
