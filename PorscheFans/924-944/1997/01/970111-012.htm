Hi Tom, 
Happy New year!
I have a low tech solution to the jacking problem. Get a length of board, a
2x8" is perfect, and cut it into 4 pieces. Drive right up on those suckers
and you will have plenty of clearance for the floor jack. Also on many floor
jacks there is a removable cup that lifts right off the jack. Doing same will
give you another couple inches of clearance. 
DO NOT lift the car by the engine oil pan as someone's mechanic suggested.
The oil pan is thin aluminium (plastic on 968's) and is a very poor choice
for jacking. I would run screaming from any mechanic that suggested that
solution. As George B suggested the front frame rails are ideal as are the
rear torsion bar covers for your jack stands. I also put a piece of board
between the jack stands and the frame rails in the front.
Cheers, 
Jerry
