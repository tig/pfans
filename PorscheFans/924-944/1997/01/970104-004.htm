Hello fellow enthusiasts!

I have a stunning dark blue Lhd 924 lux from 1982 / 125 hp Euro spec.   
Thrash it silly, must faster than most 928`s and 911`s driven by greying
baldies or yuppies who should be in Volvos etc. (no hate mail please!)
Do all the usual maintenance myself wheel bearings, belts, water pump etc.
Parts seem to be alot cheaper in the UK than the US!?

I have two technical problems that some helpful souls out there may be able
to shed some light on. 

1) When car is left standing with a hot engine for more than a few minutes
it will restart on two or three cylinders, really lumpy and clear after 10
seconds or so. Increasing revs does not help. I assumed old injectors were
to blame and replaced with new - no improvement. Cold start valve appears to
function correctly, no dripping and good jet cloud. Have not checked cold
start bi metalic sensor as in Haynes. New ignition components, correct valve
clearances, good compression.  This problem is worst on a really hot day
(not many of those here!) but is present right down to -20 C.

2) Back lash in trasmission has become more intrusive over the last 10k
miles (5 speed). All but foot to the floor or really carefull driving has
the car kangarooing around, especially sedate high gear city driving. Have
read faqs regarding rubber clutch centres, but as I fitted a new cluth and
replacement torque tube last year I think the problem is further back. Noise
from the rear of the torque tube transmission area would indicate so. Car
jacked up, rear wheels turned by hand while in gear cause "slack" sounds
from aforementioned area. Indicating CV joints are not the cause. Should I
just drop the gear box and replace with a good second hand one?  

Does anyone have any experience as to the performance gains to be achieved
by fitting the following: K&N airfilter kit, adjustable fuel head, straight
through exhaust middle box, larger carburator body kit. What about the
performance cam shaft I saw on the market a while back? Is a 944 a better bet?

I love the feel of this small car but am seduced by the greater performance
of the 944, 911 and the 928. Which of these cars would you recommend as my
next step bearing in mind I do not want too many garage bills and wish to
maintain the car myself?

Any comments appreciated.

CHEERS and HAPPY NEW YEAR! Iain
