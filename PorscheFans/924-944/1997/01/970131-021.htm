M.

There seem to be several of these happening at once.   

This sounds like classic vapor lock, which happens in a fuel
injection system when the engine is turned off and there is
no residual pressure held in the lines.   Engine heat cooks 
the unpressurized fuel and it flashes to vapor until the car
cools down again.   

Find a suitable gauge and check the pressures.   You should
have about 36 psi at idle, 42 or so under acceleration, and about
15 when the engine is turned off.

If the first two are off, change the two fuel pressure regulators
on opposite ends of the fuel rail.   If the last one is off, change
the check valve at the fuel pump.

Good luck.

Dave
