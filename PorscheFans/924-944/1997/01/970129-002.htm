     Hi Ron, welcome to 944 ownership.
     
     I got my 87 951 with a similar noise as you describe. I discovered it 
     was a VERY LOOSE balance shaft belt hitting the inside of the upper 
     belt cover. It slid back and forth on the shaft pulley with no more 
     than a gentle push of the finger. Fix That Now. If it fails, it could 
     take out the cam belt, and you would surely no longer enjoy your car 
     very much for a while. The tension on that belt is to a 5mm flex at 
     midppoint of it's longest unsuspended side. And while your there, 
     check your cam belt if you can. If it's slippy slide time, get that 
     thing towed to someone with The Tool ASAP.
     
     I got very very very lucky, as I drove my car almost 3k miles 
     listening to that noise. [yea yea, more lust than brains, I know]
     
     The 944's are wonderful cars, and I love mine. But they are 
     maintenance specific, so head up z'all.
     
     Yours in the Stuttgart spirit, 
     
     Russell Therrien,
     '87 Satinschwarz Metallic 951
