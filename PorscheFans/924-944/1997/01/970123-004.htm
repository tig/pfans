Tom,


I agree that a lot depends on how you drive.  However, as you stated that
the "real data" may not be there to back it up, I must point out that your
two cars can not be used as dependable evidence that the 10,000 mile
interval is the correct interval.  The sample size is just too small, and
unless you have done an engine tear down, you can't be sure what the 10,000
mile intervals are doing for or against you.  Granted, with cars getting
above the 313,000 mile mark, there is some evidence that the 944 motor (as
with many newer cars) is a robust engine.

Some of my data comes from the article in Excellence magazine by Andy
Saunders (Excellence, May 1994, pp. 81).  Saunders does not make claim as
to what intervals should be used, but does point out why oil should be
changed.  Sauders cites "The most important duty of detergent additives is
to neutralize acid combustion byproducts, preventing all kinds of wear"
[pp. 82].  His point is to reduce the concentrations of acids that build up
over time.  That is why I recommended the 3 - 4 month interval if you do
not drive often.

Another common problem is low mileage driving.  If your trips are short,
you add further risk of the acid build up.  Saunders last quote "In adverse
conditions, oil should be changed frequently. Cars driven for short
distances in town - particularly cars with 11 quart oil tanks - take time
to warm up.  If oil is not allowed to attain a temperature of 90 degrees C,
corrosive acids build up, leading to sludge, a milky coating on the oil
cap, and rapid internal corrosion"[pp. 84].

Lastly, Saunders makes a reference to the Teflon additives that are found
in products like Slick 50.  "DuPont, the developer of Teflon, stopped
supplying oil companies with the slippery stuff in 1980. Since then, other
suppliers have stepped in and Teflon remains on the market although its
claimed advantages are unsupported by test results.  Oil companies are
unconvinced of its value, suggesting you consider what happens if you use a
metal spatula on a Teflon pan.  They also point out that above 400 degrees
C - a temperature easily exceeded in the combustion chamber - Teflon breaks
down to form hydrofluoric acid, one of the most reactive acids known,
capable of causing extreme damage to thermal reactors, catalyst, and
exhaust system"[pp. 83].

I am sorry that I do not have other sources at my finger tips, but my time
is short.  For me, I will pay the, price of oil changes.  For regular
Castrol at $1.00 a quart, at 24 quarts per year, for ten years is $240.00.
That is far, far less than any engine rebuild.  Even adding filters at four
per year, at $5.00, or $20.00 per year, the total of $450.00 over a ten
year period is pocket change (less than $1.00 per week)!

The prosecution rests, I will let the jury decide if the 3,500 mile
interval is "extreme overkill".  It's your engine though.
