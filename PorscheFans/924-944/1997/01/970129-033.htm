The '86 944 as tested by Car and Driver exhibited a tendency to lock the
rear tires before the front.  To me this says that Porsche has proportioned
the braking force such that you get maximum braking at all fours.  Some
lesser cars seem to never wear out their rear pads because their front
wheels are doing a disproportionate amount of braking.  In other words,
your rear brakes are doing more than you maybe expected, but otherwise it
sounds like they're working fine.
