Here's my $.02 on the situation. Keep in mind that I have no actual
experiences to back this up. So take it with a gain of salt.

I agree with everyone else that the 16" Porsche Forged wheels are
superior to the C2 Turbo replicas. However.....

If you are going to compare front tires at 225 / 50 16 and 225 / 45 17
and rear tires at 245 / 45 16 and 255 / 40 17, I would go with the
16". The 17" wheels with the same size tires (practically) won't 
really help.

Now if I had those wheels, I would run 245 / 45 front, and 275 / 40 rear.
That would give you a real tread-width advantage with the 17" wheels.

One other thing, if those C2 Turbo replicas are NOT TUV approved,
I would not use them on the track.


Just my $.02,
