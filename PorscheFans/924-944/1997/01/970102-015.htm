Some things I've learned about 951 cluthes:

(i)     There seems to be only one factory part for the cluth disc.  It is the
        same for all 951's.  It has four large springs, and a secondary damper
        plate with six small ones.

(ii)    Regarding above, the six small springs have a habit of breaking
        long before the clutch is worn out, eventually causing the clutch to
        fail to release.  I have an '89 951, and these rascals broke with at
        26k miles!!!

(iii)   I've put "cup car" clutch discs in both my cars.  I have the Sachs and
        Porsche part numbers for those interested.  The dealer does not sell
        these discs.  The key differences from the current factory part are (a)
        only the four big springs are present, id est , there is no extra
        damper plate with springs to break off; and (b) the friction material
        and method of bonding seem different.  After having two cluthes
        prematurely break their springs, I'll never use the current factory
        type.  The "cup car" type can be had for the same price.

(iv)    In my '87, I had a Euroselect kit installed, which failed after five
        months.  Upon inspection, the throw out bearing was the culprit.  When
        I compared it to the normal factory part, I noted a SIGNIFICANT
        difference in quality.  I got reimbursed for the bearing and bought a
        factory unit.  There may still be some Euroselect kits out there even
        though the program was eliminated in favor of the current PPE program.
        I'd STRONGLY recommend against using the clutch disc and throw out
        bearing from one of these kits.
