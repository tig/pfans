A friend was telling me about a guy out in California who had an awful
 craving but who didn't have a cent in his pockets. He tried to
 panhandle enough for a bottle but people just ignored him.

 Desperate, he started going door to door in Bel Air, offering to cut
 lawns, take out trash, clean cellars - anything for a few bucks. Doors
 were slammed in his face.

 Finally, though, a man said, "OK, I need my porch painted. I'll give
 you $50 for the job." And the man provided three gallons of green
 paint and a brush and added, "It's in the back. Now, do a good job."

 The thirsty guy gushed, "You can count on that." And, he headed toward
 the back with the paint and brush. About an hour later, he was back at
 the door, his clothes paint-spattered. He told his benefactor, "It's
 all done and I really did a good job.  It's all painted green now."

 The guy handed him the 50 bucks and the drink-craving guy headed for
 the nearest bar.  Suddenly, he turned and yelled back to the guy who
 wanted his porch painted:

 "Hey! By the way, that's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari."
