	Uh oh. Actually, could be a lot of things. Where's it

	The "tick" is probably a "click". Check your CV joints.

	Check the headlight motor and gearing system. After 14
	years, you can sometimes get dirt and grit in them which
	will cause the system to "hang" occaisionally. Try a thorough
	cleaning. Your owner's manual should show you where the
	motor is at.

	Sounds like a wheel bearing or bad tire. What do the tires
	look like? Are they the original ones? :)

	Check the water pump and belts while you're in there...
