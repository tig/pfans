"Wolfgang wrote concerning chips for a 944S2"

We will be running my friend's S2 this weekend (my 951 is still in pieces).  He
had a Hypertech chip in it and took it out.  Said it killed the mid-range and
only helped marginally on the top end.  He has talked to Autothority (very
helpful) but did not feel the hp gain they promised was worth the bucks.  He has
also talked to a number of builders and has come to the conclusion that the S2
engine will require some major surgery and major $ to get it anywhere close to
his 300 hp dream.  

Can't wait to get to get this gem on the track just as it sits.  A Citroen is
starting to look pretty good to me.
