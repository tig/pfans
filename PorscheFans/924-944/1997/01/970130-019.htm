	Clark,

	Sounds like you got all the bases covered. You may not need
	to replace the pump though; I truly have the cooling problem
	from Hell (which I'll go into again soon) and thought it was
	the pump. It wasn't. But...if you've got the cash and want
	to do it "...while you're in there..." by all means, go ahead.	
	Good luck!
