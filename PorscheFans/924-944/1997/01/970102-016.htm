It seems somewhat obligatory with these lists to describe one's vehicles.  The 
following info may be helpful for those whom may be considering similar mods to 
their cars.

As a side note, a friend is looking for a Slate Blue/Linen late version 951, 
similar to the '89 car that was recently listed for sale in Pano (but is 
already sold).  She wants a good, clean car.  Any leads would be appreciated,  
please send via e-mail to me (address below).


My Cars

I have owned a total of four 944/951's during the past 10 years.   A few 
comments about my current cars:

'87 951, 80k miles, red w/ black Porsche cloth.  Used for street, autocross and 
time trials. I am the second owner, the car was originally purchased by an Indy 
Car driver.  He bought it after qualifying for his first 500.

The car has been converted to Turbo S specs by the original owner (turbocharger 
and rear torsion bars) and myself (all other parts).  I used parts from an '89 
that I wrecked in 1995 in Turn 2 at Laguna Seca (it had 32,000 miles).  A sad 
event indeed.

For shocks I use Koni double adjustable units in front (from the Porsche 
racing department; acquired at an Automotion swap meet for $40!), and 968 M030 
Koni Sports in the rear.  The front springs are 325 lb 2 1/2" units on 
adjustable perches.  I use 968 M030 helper springs in the rear for additional 
spring rate, as I haven't yet been able to afford larger torsion bars.

I use the 968 M030 30mm sway bar in front, and a Weltmeister adjustable in the 
rear.  I also have the Kelly-Moss camber plates and a Brey-Krause strut bar in 
front.

The car doesn't push too badly on the track, but I think I'll bite the bullet 
some time this year and get some bigger torsion bars into the thing.

Brakes, wheels, transmission, stereo (speakers!) et cetera, are all Turbo S 
parts from my wreck.  I have an Autopower roll bar and two Recaro SRB seats, 
which I got ridiculously cheap ($100 each) via a stroke of good fortune.

For better braking on the track, I've replaced the factory proportioning valve 
with an alternative unit from a 928S.  This allows me to use a little more of 
the rear brakes, but is a change that I'd only recommend for people who drive 
on the track.

I recently bought a spare center vent assembly for $25 from Partsheaven and 
fabricated a gauge panel for VDO oil temp and boost units.  The latter has 
shown that my car makes about 15.5 psi or approx. 1.1 bar.  I use this gauge 
panel during the "driving season," reinstalling the original unit in the 
Winter.  For those of you with aftermarket chips, I can recommend that you 
check your boost with an external gauge.  I didn't know I was running so high 
until I bought the VDO ($26 from Racer Wholesale).

This car has a custom set of engine performance modifications designed by John 
Milledge at the request of the original owner.  The mods include DME and KLR 
chips, a higher than stock fuel pressure regulator, wastegate shims, and a 
drilled cycling valve.

'89 951, 26k miles, red w/ black leather.  I am the fourth owner.  This car is 
in concours condition.  It's only modifications are an Autothority "Stage 2" 
set up, and some extra negative camber in all four corners.

I can conveniently compare the two cars' performance, and the '87/Milledge set 
up is much faster.
