Hi Guys, 

I have been reading the list for a long time but never posted. I guess
there is always a first for everything. 

First, I bought this car last fall and found that the head gasket was
blown (chipped car) , I rebuilded it and after putting everything
together, found that the boost gage is staying at a low 1.2 bar. The
punch is gone! Everything else is working fine, cam timing, compression
and fire. I suspect a vacuum line or else...

Anybody has any thought??? 

As far has the extended vs short oil change is concerned, I can comment
by saying that I have been working for the last 15 YEARS with a once a
year oil change for all my cars. (4 Audi's Quattro and 2 Scirooco's and
my previous 944NA) I ran those cars up to 120K miles without ANY
mechanical problems. I drive between 20-25K miles a year and normally
change the filter at half point. The Porsche received special treatment
because I was putting mineral oil for storage. The 944 has been at the
track approx. 15-20 days per year for the last 6 years! The product I
have been using is Amsoil 10W40 for the Audi's and 20W50 racing for the
Porsche. 

The benefits have been extremely good engine protection, the inside of
the engines looks new when peeking at the oil filler, easy starting and
easy shifting (use it in the tranny) in winter (we need this in Canada),
and a lot less garbage in the environment. 

I don't want to start a debate on oil change, just MY experience.
