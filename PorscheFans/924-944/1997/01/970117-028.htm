>I am considering changing the 15 year old carpets in my 924,
The kits I have used all fit pretty well.  My opinion is that the original
German fabric is a bit better than the domestic, but the domestic is
certainly up to top standards.  If there is a general deficiency it is in the
floor mat backing material, which is never as stiff as the originals.  I
have gotten around that by substituting one of the aftermarket sets
advertised everywhere.  If you don't put down something pretty stiff 
the new stuff eventually sort of rolls up under your feet

Once you take out the seats, installation is straightforward.  You will
have to loosen various trim pieces to slip the carpets underneath, but
there is no real difficulty here.  Carefully installed by anyone with
reasonable mechanical skills and a little bit of patience, you can do
really fine work.   I can't think of any irreversible mistakes you can 
make.  I'm sure you will get some recommendations from others.

If you stick with a domestic fabric, virtually any upholstery shop will
have extra material if you need it.
