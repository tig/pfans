Todd, 

given that your suspension is totally unmodified, and not really being =
familar with the 944 Cabriolet, I would suggest one of two things to look =
at. Check the front wheel alignment and make sure you've got some bite at =
the front end, could simply be a balance problem as I had when I first =
got my 924 Carrera GT. It also came with Goodrich Comp TA (from the UK) =
which I now rate as the worst performance tyre I have driven on, =
replacing the Goodrich with Dunlop Formula W1 Spec R (I assume these are =
available in the States) and set the camber to -1=B0 (was running -6=B0 =
for racing) and now have a pretty good balance for power and trailing =
throttle. 

My last suggestion is to use the accelerator a little less, or perhaps a =
little better. If this is your first performance car, find a high =
performance driving course to do and take your car out onto the track and =
find out just how to drive it.
