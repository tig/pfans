I have seen the inside of a 944 oil pan, and, frankly, it is not strong enough
to support one ton of mass at one g of gravity. It's also expensive to 
replace if you do damage it.

I use the lower control arms and lift one corner at a time, support
it with a jackstand, and move to the next corner. 

>#2  Where are the best spots for the jack stands (again, front & rear)?

In the front, the lower control arms or the frame rail, just behind the lower
control arm.

In the rear, I find the torsion bar end caps to be convenient and secure.

By the way, don't buy the welded, stamped out metal jackstands. Spend a bit
more and get good jackstands, since the last thing that you want to happen
is a 
failure of these while you are underneath 3000 lbs of German metal.


Good Luck!
