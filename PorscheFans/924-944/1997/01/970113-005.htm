Hello Out There,

As the subject line says, my car lives! On Sunday morning I completed
the job, and actually drove the car. It was a very nice change to be
able to shift into first gear when the car was idling, and not have
to double clutch for each downshift.

This past weekend, two friends came over on Saturday to help put
everything back together. Prior to that I had installed the clutch
and bellhousing. I needed help getting the torque tube in, the trans-
axle back on (with shift rod) and all the sensors back on. Then I
was able to put the CV joints back on, reconnect the exhaust, and
finish everything up.

All in all, the job went well. No unpleasant surprises. No broken
parts. It was difficult to get the transaxle aligned and bolted up,
but we did it. I have no idea how one person could do that job. 

Some random notes:
Late Friday night I was installing the bellhousing. I put it up in
position (not easy to do with the amount of room down there), lined
it up, and inserted the bolts. Everything fits. Then I took it down,
and inserted the clutch release lever into the case, and tried to
put the bellhousing back on. No way. Take the release lever out, put
the bellhousing back on. Pull bottom of housing out out far enough to
slide release lever in. OK. Work release lever into position, line up
release rod, insert, blah, blah, blah. I get everything done, bolted,
torqued, etc. Now I go into the engine compartment, and put the sensor
block back on. I get it positioned (not easy, if your hand is in the
proper area, you can't see anything, so you have to go by feel), and
try to bolt it in. I'm trying to insert the first bolt, and it slips
out of my hand (if only I had a third joint in my arm). The bolt falls
into a hole at the top of the bellhousing, but I can see it, and
reach it. OK I think to myself, take it easy and grab the bolt. Don't
let it fall into the bellhousing. So I slowly reach for the bolt, and
hit it, and it falls further into the hole. So now I get my pick up
device (not the magnetic one, the one with the little claws on the end)
and proceed to knock the bolt further into the hole. So I reach in with
my finger, and I can feel the bolt, but not grab it. Anyway, I eventually
knocked it completely into the clutch assembly. So I had to remove the 
bellhousing, spin the flywheel and then I could see the bolt and remove it.
Not a lot of fun. I can now remove and install a 944 bellhousing in
about 10 minutes.

Always wear goggles. It's not much fun having a 17mm impact socket
(the heavy ones) on a 2" extension fall and hit you in the eye. 

It's a real PIA to get the CV Bolts back in past the boots. Eventually
I just used a hammer to drive the head of the bolt passed the boot.
The 8 mm 12 point allen tool worked well for that.

The Transaxle cooler is in the way, regardless of what you are trying to do.

When I started the car, it was making a very metallic ticking sound
from somewhere in the bellhousing. The car shifted fine, and ran fine
but the ticking was directly related to engine rpm. I could see the
flywheel turning, and no metal shavings were coming out, but I didn't
like the sound. So after I stopped crying, I called one of my friends
to come over for his opinion. He showed up an hour later. When I first
started the car you could clearly hear the tick. I turned the car off,
we looked at some stuff, and I restarted the car. The tick was gone.
Any ideas?

Finally, this is a job that you can do (if you want to). It's not
impossible. It will take a long time. I estimate about 3 full days of
work. Nothing is super complicated. There are lots of bolts that
are pains to reach, but you can do it.

If anyone has specific questions, just ask. It's all very fresh in
my mind.
