There really isn't any easy way to get a lot more power from the motor.
I saw that someone was selling high compression pistons, that would
help, but I don't remember the price.

That said, I don't think the 150 hp should dissuade you from buying the 
car if you want to turn it into a time trial / club racer. While those
cars don't have a lot of power, they do have excellent handling. I've
seen a number of stock 944's, well set up, and in the hands of good
drivers, outperform 930's with twice the horsepower. This was at Bridge-
hampton, which, if anything, is a horsepower track. Also, for time 
trials, you would be competing against cars in your class, so the HP
thing is a moot point. 

For track events, I know what you mean about the relative lack of HP.
The reason I sold my 86 944 was because I got tired of hounding the
911's going into the corners, and then getting left in the dust on the
straights. My 89 944 turbo solved the HP problem.

I think you can probably get the HP to 165 - 180 fairly easy. Getting
above that would be tough. Still, if the car is well set up, and has 180
HP, you'll surprise a LOT of higher horsepower cars.

Good luck,
