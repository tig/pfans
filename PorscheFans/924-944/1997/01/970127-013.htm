	If I remember correctly, there's a "safety feature" that causes
	the sunroof to *close* automatically in cases where's it's
	been left unlocked accidentally. This saftey feature is
	supposed to enagage when you either put the car in gear or
	it starts rolling. It sounds like you've got a bad circuit
	somewhere because yours is unlocking when you start moving
	rather than locking. I have no idea where this circuit could be
	though...
