Weird that he would pump an injected car.

My 88 951 is a daily driver. Before it I was driving an 78 Alfa spider
without A/C so my definitition of daily driver may be pretty broad. I'm not
sure what your asking? If you mean are they reliable enough. Yea, you
should expect at least a couple of shop visits a year. These cars require
upkeep. You have to expect the regular things to go wrong at the regular
times. That said, they are great day to day cars. I'm thinking next winter
that I will a) put on winter tires b) change the transaxle to RedLine
synthetic for the winter. 

Speaking of winter, I did a 320 spin in the snow this morning! Didn't hit
anything! I'm an old "county boy". As a kid we would relish bad weather to
go sliding around in our cars & pickups. The P-car sure "snaps" around once
it starts to go. One second I putting the tail out for fun and the next I'm
looking through the back glass to see where we are going! Is this how they
spin at the limit at the track? I am glad the limits are high.
