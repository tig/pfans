I know what you are talking about with rednecks.  I used
to drive a '94 Honda Civic Coupe and every V8 pickup truck
seemed to take great pleasure in being able to beat me from
the stoplights.  Since I got my 944 Turbo, no one ever pulls
that stuff anymore.  In fact, I've been driving the car for
a month and only two other motorists have been jerks around
me in this time.  One was a Mustang and the other was an RX-7
Twin Turbo.  I think most people don't want to get into a
midrange acceleration contest with the 944 Turbo (unless they
enjoy getting blown off the road).
