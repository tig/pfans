Thanks Dave and Ian for your input on my '82 924 starting problem,
but I am still at a loss.

With a cold engine it cranks a few times (to build up fuel
pressure) then fires normally, suggesting the cold start value
works. Voltage to the fuel pump is 12.7 VDC. I can hold the rpm at
2,500 (to bypass the auxiliary air value and warm up regulator
functions) for a few seconds. There is no pop or back firing.

After 3 to 10 seconds the fuel pump voltage drops to 11 VDC and the
rmp drops to under 100. The engine stumbles through a few
revolutions and dies.

Turning off the key and re-starting yields the exact same results:
12.7 VDC at pump, engine runs okay then dies. After several
attempts (engine warms up somewhat?) the voltage stays at 12.7 VDC
and the car runs normally. The idle is a little high until the
auxiliary air value closes.

Bypassing the fuel pump relay (jump pins 30 to 87) has no effect on
the problem.

The schematics (Haynes manual 1981 & 1982 supplement) show a
"supplementary start value". But I can find no reference to it in
the text?

Any ideas of what else to check will be appreciated.

Just out of curiosity, the schematics also show two fuel pumps, one
is labeled "Fuel pump (in tank)" and the other is labeled "Fuel
Pump". Does this model have two fuel pumps?

Robert
