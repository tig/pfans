Hi Pfans, I'm in a quandry. Pardon the cross-post, but I'm looking for
a car and I don't know which!

I've been looking for a while for a 944S2 without much luck (have only
been looking locally and they're few and far between up here - Vancouver
Canada). The choice of the 944S2 was in a large part budget-driven...

I've recently discovered/decided that I can spend more on a car than I
was previously thinking. This opens up some possibilities.

I believe that my budget will permit me to buy any of:

- 944S2
- 944 Turbo S (less interested in this)
- 911 Carrera (perhaps up to '86 or '87 or so)
- POSSIBLY a 968 though I doubt it (don't know the values of these cars and
  it would be even harder to come by than a 944S2 anyway)
- ???

I'm looking for something that will be a daily driver, PLUS weekend
autocross fun (NOT super-competetive), and hopefully some drivers-ed
type events.

I'm ALSO looking for something that I can drive year-round. We don't
normally get much snow here at all, though this year has been an exception.
I have no problem putting snow tires on whatever vehicle I get... if the
car will deal with the conditions ok.

I know the 944 is generally a much more modern design than the 911, with
purportedly better balance, better ergonomics, better ventilation, etc.
I don't know whether "better" is a matter of fine degree or whether there
are gross differences.

I love the 911 body shape. I like the 944 Turbo/S2 body shape though not
as much.

Would anyone who's driven both the 944S2 and 911 Carrera care to comment
on the differences? On your feelings, emotions, etc when you see/drive
these cars?

I'd also appreciate a quick rundown on the changes made to the 911 over
the post-'84 years. About all I know so far is that the '84 car was the
first with the 3.2 liter engine and motronic engine management, but don't
know much else versus the SC, or what the differences are between the
various Carrera years (eg. I think the ventilation was improved in '86
but what they did or what other changes were made I dunno!)

Any advice would be great! Even if it's "Buy this book - it'll answer some
of your questions"!

Thanks!

Ross
