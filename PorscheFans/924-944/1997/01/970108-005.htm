If I remember correctly it does have a light but I will double check   
tonight and let you
know if it doesn't. Wish it had lights on the console switches below the   
clock though.

Also I got 24,000 miles out of my rear tires on my 968 with the fronts   
looking
about half gone. Quess I need to drive a little harder ;< )   Original   
Toyo's which
I couldn't wait to get off.  Good in dry but really bad in cold weather   
or rain.  Now
have Bridgestone RE940 which I really like for the street.

I agree with the guy who said build quality was not what you might   
expect.
Sunroof squeaks like crazy but no rear hatch squeaks or leaks.  Glue   
drips
on rear seat carpet area and water looking marks under clear coat on   
paint
which chips at the slightest thought of a rock or sand.  Looks like it   
got rained
on before the clear coat went on?  Great driving car with no turbo and   
drop dead
beautiful from over 5 feet away.
