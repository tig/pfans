This'll work fine.  I'm set up with 7&8 x 16 and they're more than adequate.
 
225x50 on front, 245x45 on the back.  17's and more rubber might be too much 
to push around with this kind of hp. <<

After experienced replies from you and Bill Buetow, I'm leaning
towards stock forged 8x16 both front and rear with 245/45 all around. 
Like my '72S this would allow swapping front to rear to even out
wear too! I'll probably run a bigger than stock front bar (turbo bar?)
so the bigger front wheels and tires could make it
handle like a dream.

Maybe she saw Jimi??? (Elvis wouldn't have thought of that).
