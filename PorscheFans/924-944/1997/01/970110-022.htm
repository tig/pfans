No.  Sorry, I didn't read closely enough.  I wonder if it is really timing
belt noise you hear?  Other things get spun whilst the engine is turning,
e.g, alternator, ac, ps.  You might consider disconnecting each of these
belts and see if the noise goes away.  Alternators can give a lot of aural
warning to bearing failure in 944s especially.  You can do no harm running
the engine without these belts, and wouldn't you and the shop feel dumb if......

Take heart, I spent one of the most miserable days of my life, in a carport,
on the coast of North Carolina, in the summer, replacing a Volvo timing
chain when the noise was really from the smog pump.

I would not change any of the stuff that just got changed.  I don't think
you have isolated the problem.  The only caveat to this worthless advice
would be, '...unless the shop (just) SAID they replace them...."

Ever vigilant....

Dave
