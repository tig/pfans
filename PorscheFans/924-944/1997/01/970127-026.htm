HE DID GIVE ME A GOOD DEAL BECAUSE WHEN I TOOK THE CAR
IN 2 WEEKS AGO, HE TOOK ALMOST A WEEK TO DO JUST A 
MAJOR TUNE-UP, SO HE KNOCKED OFF AROUND $200.
HE WAS SHORT TWO MECHANICS, AND HE WAS SWAMPED WITH
CUSTOMERS.  ALSO, HE HAD A LOT OF PORSCHES THAT HAD
FLOOD DAMAGE TO THEM.  HE TOLD WHEN
I LEFT THAT I GOT THIS WATER PUMP FOR ALMOST FOR FREE.
HE DOES VERY GOOD WORK.
