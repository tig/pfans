>O.K. I took the plunge.  I now have $1500 holding a '87 944 with 99K, and

Decent price.

 After

So I guess you towed it home.   Listen up:   This is a several thousand
dollar risk.   The Brits would say that a "slapping" timing belt is "dodgey".
I would suspect you are hearing something else, since if it were that
loose you would already be walking.

 Also,

Yes, there is an epidemic of reservoir-to-pump hose failures.   Before you
end up buying a pump, put some fluid in it.   

 The wheel feels
>smooth around turns, no rough parts.  Also I didn't see and evidence of
>fluid leaking, so I am wondering if it could have just been neglected? 

Yeah, the PO neglected to fix the leak, and the dealed neglected to fix the
leak, and . . . . 

>Also upon closer inspection, the motor mounts seem fine, but the car does

How did you "inspect" the motor mounts?   Shaking at idle and running
fine above is the classic sign of a bad motor mount.   

 Any specific recommendations for plugs and wires for this car?

OEM only.   Only.   Only.

  And
>last but not least, the driving (auxiliary) lights don't work.  The

Anything from the switch, relay, fuse, or bulbs.

One last recommendation.   You paid a very low price for this car.   You can
afford to take it to a shop experienced with Porsches and at least get some
of this stuff properly diagnosed.   That dealer was no fool.   He knew exactly, 
exactly, exactly what it was worth.   He has challenged you  to find out why
it wasn't worth the $8000 or so that the book says it was.

Welcome to the family.
