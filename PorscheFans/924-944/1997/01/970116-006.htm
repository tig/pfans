Kerry,
     I had the exact same problem on my 944S last winter here in New
England. I took it to my local mechanic and he felt thet it was being
caused by a bad half shaft. Then one day I drove it about 70 miles and
the noise just went away. Another mechanic told me the noise could of
been caused by the grease setteling in the half shaft boot, and that it
took a fairly long drive to get it spread around again. Mind you it is
very cold where I live in the winter. But your problem sounds exactly
like mine. I don't think it's the end of the world, it will proberbly
just work itself out like mine did.

                                             Good luck,
                                           mwatson(northeast region)
                                           87 944S
