        I installed an Autothority chip in my 88 924S and could not tell a
        difference in 'seat of the pants' feel.  There seemed to be no downside
        (emissions actually got a hair better but this make be luck of very     
        limited testing data) so I left it in there.  I wouldn't buy one again. 
        These companies' ads always have horsepower curves that show a gain but 
        I wish they would reveal exactly what parameters they change to achieve 
        this.  I assume on a normally aspirated car mostly they advance the     
        ignition sooner and farther.  If I had the time I would get out the     
        timing light and compare the chip to the OEM DME.  Also you could do
        acceleration or lap time tests to see if it was really useless.

        One possible disclaimer to the 'useless chip' is that I live at 5000    
        feet elevation and perhaps it would be different at sea level.  Nothing
        else was required other than slapping in the chip BUT the instructions  
        warn you to use only premium gas (sounds like advanced ignition, huh). 

        Jon
