Dear Michael:
 
 When I bought my 968 a few weeks ago from a P-A dealer, I was told that the
 original owner had the car lowered to "Euro height."  The car does indeed
 look a little bit lower than stock and handles extremely well.  I haven't
 driven a 968 at the original height, however.  I also noticed that my car's
 ride really is quite stiff, especially over broken Midwestern pavement.

The American ride height is about 3/4" to 1" higher than the European height
so the car will pass the American bumper laws.  The car was designed to be
driven at the European ride height and there is plenty of room in the
suspension for the readjustment.  
 
 1.  How can I tell how my car was lowered (replacement springs, heat-treated
 stock springs, or some other method)?

Normally to lower to European ride height only involves adjusting the front
and rear alignment, no replacement parts are required.
 
 2.  How much does lowering improve handling on the street or on the track
(or
 at driver's ed events)?

You will notice a slight improvement in cornering stability on the track.

 
 3.  How much does lowering the car about an inch affect the ride?
  >>

Not much at all, as it was designed to driven at that height.  This is all
assuming that it was done properly and realigned properly after the
adjustment.

Thank you,
