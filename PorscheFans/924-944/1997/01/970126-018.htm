I am a relatively new member to this P-car thing and an even newer member to
this 
list.  I am amazed by the knowledge and help from all the contributing
members.
I have recently purchased a 1988 944 158 hp with 39,000 mi and love it.  The
PO has all the receipts and even the original window sticker.  Looks like it
just came off the showroom floor.  Call it dumb luck, but I think I stumbled
on a great car.  I love to drive it so here is the question.  I received a
sale mailer from "Automotion" and noticed that they have "chips" for  about
$240 for this car.  I am wondering, since I don't race this thing, is 4 to 10
hp from this chip going to be noticable and what else has to be done in
conjunction with just slapping in a new chip.  I would also like to know
where these are located in the car.  I've replaced chips in computers etc.
and assume, whoops, there's that word, that's it's pretty much the same.  In
addition to this I have also been following this list and gather that most
prefer synthetic oils.  I recently came across a file called oil-facts that I
downloaded re: viscosity index and flash points etc that was very
informative.  Would be glad to send the file to anyone interested.  Cant'
remember where I found it.  Well, thanks to all any assistance, longing for
Spring.  Martyste@aol.com
