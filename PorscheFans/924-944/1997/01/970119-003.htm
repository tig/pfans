The problem is caused by a small plastic gear which slips on a shaft.
The classic advice is never to press the trip meter reset when the car
is moving. In fact, I have had it occur when I reset the trip meter with
the car at a dead stop. Anyway, the fix is fairly simple and involves
removing the gauge, prying of the bezel to open it, and pushing the gear
back in place. The whole process takes about an hour or less, depending
on how many times you've done it... I can dig up a copy of the procedure
from an old Porschephiles posting if you would like it. To make the fix
permanent, you have to glue the gear in place - don't ask me how I
know...
