Hi All,
        A fairly high proportion of mail here mentions chips one way or
another.  For those of you that do not know, changing chips is not legal in
PCA Club Racing stock classes.  Well, not exactly. In a turbo car, you can
change the DME chip and race "modified", which means bumping up one class.
Under no circumstances can the KLR chip be changed.  Since the KLR box is
the one that controls boost, that's where the HP is.    
        I'm contemplating a little experiment to see what kind of variation
there is between stock chips.  I have a setup where my chips are mounted
outside of the boxes themselves so they are easy to change.  I'd like to
get a few sets of stock chips and swap them at some drivers ed event to see
what, if any, power or boost differences there are.
        Therefore I am interested in buying sets of STOCK chips - '89
944turbos ONLY - to do my little experiment.  Those of you with '89 944
turbos that have converted to aftermarket chips and still have the stock
chips sitting around please e-mail me if you're interested in selling.  It
won't be much, but consider it in the cause of science.
