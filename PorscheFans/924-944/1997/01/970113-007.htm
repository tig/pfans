     Hi Andy,
     
     I think I had some symptoms like that.  Forget the two aspirins and 
     call the service man in the morning.  I seem to remember a recent post 
     about some erratic throttle behavior before (within the last week).  
     George (944 Ecology) recommended a little carb cleaner at the throttle 
     body if I recall.  It sounds like a sticky throttle body vane.  You 
     may need to cruise the archives to find it, but that would be my first 
     guess.  If I remember the post correctly, a reply from George 
     explained where to do the stick.
     
     The weather is getting so cold and last year my throttle would stick 
     at part way open when it got this cold.  Ultimately it failed and a 
     used one was substituted and life has been good since then.
     
     Also, normal idle should be about 940 rpm.  Oil pressure will also 
     drop radically when engine idle drops below that speed.
     
     At least you not having myocardial infarction.

             O.k., I can admit when I need help!  Scenario: going home on 
     cold
     winter night.  '87 944S all warmed up, tooling along.  A few flickers 
     of the
     oil pressure gauge.  "Hmmm...haven't seen that before," thinks I.  Ten
     seconds later, after I shift into neutral approaching stoplight,
     aforementioned Porsche dies.  Restarts.  Dies.  After a little hand
     wringing, I realize that if I keep the revs up, it doesn't die.  Limp 
     home,
     goosing the gas at stoplights.  
             Engine temp normal.  Everything else normal.  At home, doesn't 
     die,
     but after I goose the gas and let off, revs and oil pressure needle 
     don't
     slowly settle back (like normal), but drop rather quickly to below 
     normal
     idle and the engince almost stalls. BTW, normal idle on this car is at 
     (or
     slightly above) 1000 RPM.  
             Any thoughts? (read: "Help!")  I like to work on the car, but 
     my
     skills are limited, I admit. 
     
     TIA (which could mean "thanks in advance" or "transient ischemic 
     attack,"
     either way applies)
