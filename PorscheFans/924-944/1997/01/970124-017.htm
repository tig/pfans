	Butch, how about records? Does it have any of those? If not,
	where does the owner have it serviced? Can you go by there
	and ask what they think of the car and if it has any problems?
	Or does he take it to Bob's Jiffy Lube and to the local Exxon
	if he has a problem? How the owner treats the car can tell you
	a lot about what sort of problems you might expect. For me,
	(and I'm a real major stickler when it comes to maintenance
	because I know what can happen) I wouldn't touch a car that hasn't
	been maintained by a top-notch shop and treated with a lot
	of TLC by it's owner(s). As for likes and dislikes, the 944 is
	an awesome car. I wouldn't trade it for anything. Reliability
	is generally good but there are some things that are going to
	go out that are expensive (water pump, clutch, etc.) so be
	prepared for this. Don't buy the car thinking you'll only
	be spending a couple hundred a year on maintenance because
	you may get a nasty surprise. Let us know what you do...
