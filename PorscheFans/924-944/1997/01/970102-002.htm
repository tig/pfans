Hi Gregor. I too have had this problem on the driver's side well only. I
brought this same topic up about 2 months ago with no solution. I
dried it all out and next time we had a heavy rainfall I rechecked the
well. It was easier to see the source of the leak, which in my case I saw
drops of water running on the outside of the sunroof drain hose. I've yet
to trace the hose back from where it enters the well. As it looks like I
have to remove a side panel? My guess is the seal around the drain hose in
the sunroof is leaking water thru, even though the hose may not be
clogged. May explain why stuff in the well not at the bottom gets wet
(i.e. water drops off the hose at the top of the well, down to the
bottom). In my case the water at the bottom was not draining out and there
was a 2 to 3 inch pool. Lemme no what you think.
