 <Guys, here's the cold truth. The state of PCA Club Racing is INHO not 
 <good.It is a lot different then it was in its early years......... 
  
 I suspect that from one perspective this is true.  More and more money is 
 coming into Club racing and the level of car preparation, driver skill and 
 competition is increasing. I think this makes the state of Club racing
better, 
 however not worse.

Ted, 
Thanks for the thoughtful post in response to my grousing about Club Racing.
The racing is much more competitive now then in the beginning and that, as I
see it, is a problem. When we first started Club Racing it was based on the
Vintage Racing model where participation and not winning were the objectives.
Most of us were PCA instructors who drove our cars to the races, had a great
time racing, and drove them home. The next day we cleaned them up and used
them for street cars. Now this just doesn't happen and IMHO it's a shame. 
Winning at any cost now seems to be the rule and a large portion of the
entrants come with professionally prepared cars on closed trailers. It seems
like the whole flavor of the events is now a bit tainted. I enjoy seeing all
the technology that goes into these Club Racers but it seems the objectives
of the series have been lost. It's a bit discouraging to find out that your
competitors have full Kelly Moss heim jointed suspensions with adjustable
everything. I have seen many cars in the *stock* classes with these mods
which can easily cost in excess of $15,000 for suspension parts alone. Also
there seems to be a definite tendency to throw cubic dollars at "stock"
engines. I run in E stock with a TurboS. When I first started Club Racing I
always finished in the top 25% of my class. Each year my times at any given
track have gone down by a second or two and yet I keep falling back in the
pack. Guys with identical "stock" cars are blowing my doors off in the
straights. There is a reason for this. Part of it is the level of talent has
risen, which is fine. The other part is the unbelievable amount of money some
people are willing to spend on a Club Racer and this is in the stock classes.
The mind boggles at what is going on in the modified classes. I know of one
fellow that spent over $150,000 on a 930 (in one year)that runs in D stock.
Not surprisingly he often wins his class. Also not surprisingly he has been
suspended for a year for cheating and physically attacking a PCA Official
after being informed of his latest DQ for having illegal mods. It's fun- go
to the races and a hockey game breaks out.
I guess the point is that PCA Club Racing is less of a venue for GrassRoots
motorsporting than it used to be and that is a shame because it was a bunch
more fun when the people were racing their cars instead of their wallets. Of
course if I had that much disposable income you wouldn't hear so much sour
grapes because I, too, would be building a killer car <g>
Regards, 
Jerry
