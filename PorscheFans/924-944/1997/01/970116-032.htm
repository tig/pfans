As long as the quirks are UNDERSTANDABLE and something I can account for,
I can handle less-forgiving handling.

I used to own a '73 914 2.0l which was a blast to drive, but something that
had to be treated with respect. That's fine by me - I'd prefer to do my
"near/at the limit" driving OFF the street in any case.

Heh - a good defroster does count for something, but it never does get
all that cold up here (VERY rarely as low as 20 farenheit).

Or I might *like* your girlfriend but wouldn't want to spend my life
with her, eh? ;^)

I'm going to try to line up some test drives in the next couple of weeks.

Yes, it helps a lot! No, 'afraid I haven't considered a 928... I suspect
that's *your* girlfriend to beat your analogy to death ;^)

Not my cup of tea. I *like* the car, but not as much as the 944/911.
