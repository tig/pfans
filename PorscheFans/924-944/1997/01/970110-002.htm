I have owned my 87 944S for about three weeks and have had enough time to
locate and/or repair nearly a decades worth of little problems.  And I've
enjoyed every minute of it!

One tip about fixing a leaking rear hatch.  Before you go replacing
expensive rubber seals like most people seem to suggest, make sure
everything is still tight.  I found that the two bolts holding each of the
receivers that catch the hatchback's two long pins had loosened up
considerably and made for sloppy closing of the hatch and a very
"non-watertight" seal between the body and the receivers located
underneath.  The receivers are so easy to get to that the task couldn't
have been simpler.  Anyway, hope it helps!
