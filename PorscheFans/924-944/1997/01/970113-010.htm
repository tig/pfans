     Hi barry,
     
     Congratulations!
     
     It might be the speed sensor block is adjusted too low and one of the 
     speed sensors was nicking the flywheel.
     
     I had similar problems with the torque tube, but I used wooden blocks 
     to keep the tube at the right attitude, then raised and lowered the 
     tail of the engine until I had a match.  The tube slid right in as 
     easy as that old lady that just pulled into your parking space at the 
     shopping mart.

     When I started the car, it was making a very metallic ticking sound
     from somewhere in the bellhousing. The car shifted fine, and ran fine
     but the ticking was directly related to engine rpm. I could see the
     flywheel turning, and no metal shavings were coming out, but I didn't
     like the sound. So after I stopped crying, I called one of my friends
     to come over for his opinion. He showed up an hour later. When I first
     started the car you could clearly hear the tick. I turned the car off,
     we looked at some stuff, and I restarted the car. The tick was gone.
     Any ideas?
     
     Finally, this is a job that you can do (if you want to). It's not
     impossible. It will take a long time. I estimate about 3 full days of
     work. Nothing is super complicated. There are lots of bolts that
     are pains to reach, but you can do it.
     
     If anyone has specific questions, just ask. It's all very fresh in
     my mind.
