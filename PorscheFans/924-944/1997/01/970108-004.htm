Call Web-Cam in Riverside, CA.   They can advise on what can be done, and
can repair it if it is possible.  Otherwise, you might have to part out the
other engine, or spend the big bucks for a new one, or wait for a used one
to show up.  (I have not heard of your malfunction, can't even imagine why
it would occur.)

  I do not want to dismantle the motor in

>on swapping used 100,000 mile camshafts.  While I had the motor apart I

>Karting and Drag cars I know that a camshaft is the heart of the engine,
>and that any type of engine can benefit from profile changes to better

Web-Cam has a performance grind they can do by hard-welding the lobes on
your cam.  They want a little over $400 for the work, but my experience has
been that they set the standard by which the rest may be judged.  They are
very quick also.  Call them at 909-369-5144.  I have used them many times
and have always been impressed.
