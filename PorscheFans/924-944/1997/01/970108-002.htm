     I have just been notified of a 1984 944 that is going up for sale
     by one of the local insurance companies!!! Apparently the car
     was taken for a joy ride around the gentleman's property (small farm)
     I have not seen the car yet but I do know that the ignition is broken
     and that they are unable to start the car!! I guess either some glass
     or the door lock is broken! ( no big deal ) I am not sure as to how
     bad the body is ??? I have been told that the insurance company will
     get the car running before I go and take a look so at least I can 
     take it for a ride!! My question is what is one of these cars worth
     in mint condition?? and given the info supplied what would any of you
     944 guys pay for this thing????? Any help would be much appreciated
     I live in Toronto Canada so pls let me know if you are talking about 
     American funds! 
     Thanks A.P
