Ted and Jerry:

You've got it wrong... The problem with removing the thermostat is
that it cools the engine TOO MUCH, not too little.  Your engine was
designed to run at a certain water temperature; running it colder
than that can decrease its power and shorten its life.

The restrictors that Ted mentions exist in order to keep the engine 
from running too cold, not to prevent it from running too hot.
