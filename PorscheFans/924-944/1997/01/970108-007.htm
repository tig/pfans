I am assuming you mean the MR2T and not the normally aspirated version.
Having driven the Mitsubishi equivalent of an MR2, the Eagle Talon since
1992, and now owning an 89 944TS, I can probably give you
a good comparison.  The MR2T's and the Eagle Talon TSi AWD's engines are
usually compared because they are very similar in feel and reliability.
Turbo Magazine recently wrote that the Talon motor is likely the world's
best 2.0L 4-cylinder motor for reliability under stress and the MR2T 
motor was right up there in second.  Now, keep in mind that when Turbo
Magazine says "World's best", it should be deduced as "America's best",
but anyhow.  As smooth as the MR2 and Mitsu engines are, the 944T engine
will really surprise you.  In the MR2 and Talon, you really have to 
rev quite high to get good power out of it and when you do rev high, it
feels really sweet, or so I thought.  I used to love revving the piss
out of my Talon engine (7400rpm was the rev-limiter cutoff), but I had
no idea what a really smooth engine was until I go the 944T.  6500rpm
in the Porsche feels totally normal, no stress, no buzzing.  You do have
to rev quite high in the 944T also, but it just feels so much better up
there than the Japanese 2.0L engines do.

When people ask me what the biggest difference between the Talon and the
944T is, I always reply, "Effortless Power".  My Talon was heavily modified,
so sure it was fast, and I'm sure you've probably turned the boost up in
your MR2.  With the 2-chip upgrade in the 944T, I guarantee that it will
surprise you with its power.  I think this is where the extra 0.5L of
displacement really helps over the 2.0L MR2 engine.

As far as build quality, the MR2 should be on par with the 944T.  The Talon's
build quality wasn't as high as the MR2 or the 944T.  One thing to always
keep in mind, especially if you are coming from a 92-95 MR2T is that the
944T is going to be an older car, in my case, eight years old.  Hoses,
fuses, relays, water pumps, seals, etc. can and will go in an older car.
I've been fortunate so far in that the only real problem I've had was
a leaking water pump which I was going to replace anyways.

If you do buy a 944T, do yourself a favour and follow the advice that 
really worked well for me.  I can't remember who told me to do this so
I can't give the proper credit, but anyhow:

1. Always get the car inspected by a 3rd party, no matter how attached you
   are to the car.  I had it inspected by the shop I bought it at because
   they do the most thorough job and they stand behind their work.  If,
   for example they say the pad has 80% life left and within a  week, 
   the pad warning light turns on and it shows the pad is completely
   worn, they would replace the pad.  I've never had to use this warranty,
   but it's pretty common around here to provide that protection when you
   spent C$400 on an inspection.  They do full leakdown and compression
   tests and give you a 4 (or 6) page document listing all the problems.
2. As soon as you get the car, get it to a good shop (dealer or otherwise)
   and change the timing belts/balance shaft belts/water pump and accessory
   belts.  There is nothing more unnerving than getting a new car that
   breaks a timing belt after the PO said it was recently changed.  Who 
   knows who changed the belt when the PO had it.
3. Get a new set of tires/wheels.  I know this is overkill to some, but I
   intend on doing some high speed track events as well as drive briskly
   on the road and I don't want to find out the hard way that the PO had
   used a plug to fill a nail hole (the speed rating drops substantially
   as well as the overall safety of that tire) or he had some cheap shop
   repair a damaged wheel.
4. While the car is in the shop getting the timing belts, etc. done, get
   synthetic oil put in the engine, power steering reservoir, etc.  Run
   Swepco 201 in the transmission though, it worked better for me than
   synthetic gear oil.
5. Just as you likely did with your MR2T, religiously get oil changes
   every 3000 miles and always use synthetic.  Don't cheapen out on the
   oil filters either, get a proper filter and change it every 3000 miles.
6. Get the two chip upgrade, it's serious fun.

Other than that, find your usual testing route that you use in your MR2
and build up confidence over a period of time.  As fast and fun as the
MR2 is, the 944T has a way of making you go WAY faster than you thought
you were going.  I've had the car up to 265km/h.  For the life of me,
I would never have guessed I was going that fast, I seriously thought I
had just touched 220 perhaps, but a close inspection down reveiled the
speedometer further ahead than I thought.  I can also attest that the
brakes slow the car down really well from those speeds.

Many people say that the 944T is a very easy car to drive, etc.  It is
to some extent, but like any car with decent HP, if driven improperly,
it will get you in trouble and I've noticed that once you do get the car
sideways, without getting back on the throttle, it's really hard to stop
the back end from wagging.  It sounds easy enough, just get back on
the throttle, but if there is a stop box in your local autocross coming
up, it's hard to justify doing that.  The steering really loads up too
when it starts the tail wagging.  I've now seen so many people spin their
944's (including myself) when they come into a corner hot and lift off.
For me, it's because I was used to FWD and AWD cars where you can do that,
slide the back slightly and be on with business as usual around the auto-x
track, but in the 944, if you do that, it really tends to wag.  It's
probably because I'm not used to all of that weight back there with the
50/50 weight distribution, etc.  You should have no problems there.  All of
this can of course be dialed out with the alignment and suspension settings,
but I really enjoy it now, so I've left it as is.

Anyhow, I've now had my 89 944TS for almost half a year and have covered
a little over 6000kms.  I have a very short drive to work ~20kms so you
can see that many of those kms were spent carving up our beautiful mountain
roads.

In conclusion, get the 944T, you will never, ever, ever buy a Japanese
sports car again.  It just doesn't feel right anymore.  Just my opinion
of course.  Wow, I can't believe I typed all of this, I must really like
this car! :)
