Michael

Could this be true that 968's have a non-collision design? I find this
hard
to believe since the 968 has a even higher compression ratio than the
944's
Sure hope you are right.  Anyone know for sure?

Also I don't recall any factory spec for changing water pumps.  I know
the
owners manual says to change timing belts at 60,000 miles which I plan
on doing at 45,000 miles just in case.  I have wondered about changing
the
water pump also and will wait till at least 60,000 miles maybe 75,000 or
90,000 when the next belts will be changed.  It seems there is no
general
time that water pumps go and many of you say wait till it goes before
changing.  The part number for the 968 pump is different so does this 
mean that Porsche beefed up the water pump or is there just some slight
hose connection difference?  I've seen that the price is more for the
968's
pump, is this just due to smaller numbers of parts or a real (better)
difference?

What are you 968 owners doing?
