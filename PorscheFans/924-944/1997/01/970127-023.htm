Hi Wes and Eric,

The rear seats weigh <28lbs.  The majority of the weight is in the top half of
the seat.  The lower half might weigh 10lbs.  It is easy to remove them.  The
top half has a bolt on either side that creates the pivot for the seat to fold
down.

The bottom portion consists of a two/three inch thick pad with vinyl wrapped
around the outside of it. It is primarily glued into place.  The steal body of
the car is molded into the shape of the rear seat, to which the seat is glued.
The seat belt bolts and a small clip also hold it down.  The clip is in the
upper center portion of the seat.  Basically it is a male/female type with the
mail portion being on the car.  After you remove all the belt bolts, gently
pull the seat up until it breaks free.

If you want to loose weight, remove the top portion.  Leave the bottom portion
in, the back looks pretty bad without it, plus it doesn't weigh much anyway.

Good luck!
