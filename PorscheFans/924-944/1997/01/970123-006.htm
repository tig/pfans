I just took my (newly aquired) 1987 924S to "the friendly Porsche Dealer of 
my confidence" (?) for maintenance. The car has run 170 kkms (106 kmls) so 
far and a complete service history. So according to the maintenance plan, it 
was time for a 12.5 kmls inspection plus change of timing belt and all 
fluids (engine, gearbox, brakes, radiator).

QUESTION: This maintenance did cost ~2900 Deutschmarks (= 1800-1900 US-$). 
Re-tensioning of the belt after 2000 to 2500 mls will be another 100 $. I 
know it is not a Volkswagen (=people's wagon) although it shares many parts. 
But are these numbers that i just have to live with if i want my car to be 
serviced (by a Dealer or a similar skilled authority) ?

Maybe i'm just spoiled by the bulletproof design of some BMWs (2002s and 
early 5ers). These beasts have cast-iron engine blocks, timing chains 
instead of belts, more space under the hood (...and a bit of bang for the 
buck) and are relatively easy to work on yourself. 

I really like my P-car, but if regular maintenance may run up to between 
30-50 per cent of the actual value of the car... it makes me a bit sad.

I just want to know: How much did you pay for inspection and/or replacement 
of the timing belt in the US, Europe or anywhere else ?

Thank you for your time,

Olav Berthold (Hannover, Germany)
