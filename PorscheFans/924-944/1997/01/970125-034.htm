To Mssr's. Forder & Gholghesaei:

My last Porsche was a 1978 924.  I loved it but it had the same 
conditions you both describe.  

Smooth starting requires good fuel pressure in the lines.  Most folks 
beggin by suspecting the fuel pump relay and/or the fuel pump.  I think 
this is appropriate both logically and because you should always begin 
troubleshooting with the items that would be most easily investigated.
If you have eliminated these as problems, I'm afraid your next step is 
the fuel accumulators (yes, plural).  The dead giveaway in your 
description was the scent of gasoline.  The accumulators do sometimes 
develop cracks.  This allows your fuel lines to lose pressure and your 
gas to vaporize.  Hence, your vapor-lock once the car is already warm.

I think I remember paying $160 each for the accumulators and then quite 
some labor.  Perhaps investigate doing this yourself.

Best of luck.  E-mail me directly if you'd like me to pull out my 
service record for exact repair cost.

Dave
85.5 944
