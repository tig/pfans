O.K. I took the plunge.  I now have $1500 holding a '87 944 with 99K, and
will be paying $3500 for it ($4010 with T,T, & T and "dealer fee")  After
taking a much closer look at the car, there are few evident problems. 
However, I can hear the timing belt slapping around in the timing belt
cover, and am going to replace it first thing before I drive it.  Also,
there is NO power steering fluid in the car, and I am wondering if there is
a common point of failure in the PS system on 944's?  The wheel feels
smooth around turns, no rough parts.  Also I didn't see and evidence of
fluid leaking, so I am wondering if it could have just been neglected? 
Also upon closer inspection, the motor mounts seem fine, but the car does
need a "tune up", it shakes at idle but runs great at anything above ~1000
RPM  Any specific recommendations for plugs and wires for this car?  And
last but not least, the driving (auxiliary) lights don't work.  The
indicator on the switch doesn't even turn on.  The relay is in place, but I
haven't had a chance to check into it.  Is there a common point of failure
in the driving lights circuit?

I also need parts sources for some minor interior parts (center console for
a start) and mechanical stuff like a water pump (may as well replace it
while I'm in there) and the timing belt.  Does someone on the list have the
$500 tensioner tool that they'd loan to me? (I'll pay to "rent" it and pay
shipping.)

And one last question... I noticed there is a small exhaust passage which
runs from the exhaust pipe just behind the O2 sensor into the engine
compartment.  It is capped off.  Is this normal, or should it be hooked up
to something like an air pump or EGR? I can't tell if the cap is factory or
not and it didn't strike me as being right.

Thanks again for all your information and your recommendations.
