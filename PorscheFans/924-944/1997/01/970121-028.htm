  IMNSHO the 944 is a great car to start your racing carreer with in that
the car is much easier to drive at the limit than a 911 thereby allowing you
the higher level of concentration on things like line and learning to deal
with traffic and the car will forgive you more easily than a 911 when you
make a wrong decision and need to change it when it is almost too late.

>1.  What year/model 944 should I buy/avoid?

   Turbo S cars are great in that they have big brakes and great suspension
for the track but, they are still turbos and can become frustrating to some
people. 

>2.  What class should I target?

   Classes I thru F generally provide great competition all thru the ranks
of the class in that there is usually good racing from the slowest guys to
the fastest guys and almost always the largest classes.

>3.  What modifications (brakes, suspension, wheels/tires, engine, cage,
>seats, etc.) can/should I make (as much detail as possible so that I can

   The stock brakes should be good enough for whatever class you run in with
a stock car. The addition of cooling ducts is a very good addition and free
in the rule book in that they do not move you up in class for using them.
All the suspension work you can afford withuot moving you up in class is
suggested because again, many mods in this area are free. 1" wider wheels
are allowed without moving you up in class and are recomended. Leave the
engine stock except removing the cat. A cage is a very inexspensive
insurance policy and you need to remember this sport is a dangerous one, so
all the safety devices you can get are cheap medical insurance. A good seat
is important for many reasons two of which are to support you in the event
of an impact and to support you so that your perspective is the same thru
all transitions and thereby making you more consistent.

   This might be selfish but here goes, I have for sale a 2 owner 1989 944S2
MO30 car with limited slip/double adj Konis, big bars adj ride height with
66K on it. The car had new timing belts and clutch at 62K. I have comlete
set of manuals and all history on the car since new. The car has a Saftey
Devices cage in it and a PCA log book to go with it. This means you just
show up at the race with your liscence and the car and log book and away you
go on to the track. The car is red w black int and polished 8" & 9" wheels
with Kumho stickeys on it. This car has only 2 races on it at Willow 11/96
and Sears Point 12/96. The car qualified on the pole and won at Willow and
Qualified on the pole at Sears. The car is lettered and has vinyl graphics
on it and is ready to go. It is also liscenced in the state of Washington
and driven semi-dailey.

>6.  Advise?

  IMNSHO PCA club racing is the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
