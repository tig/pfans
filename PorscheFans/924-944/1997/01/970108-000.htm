Luis:

You asked in a note from 1/6 to the list whether or not the analog clock on a
968 has a light.  My 92 968 has an analog clock down low on the console to
the right, and it has a light which comes on with the rest of the instrument
panel lights, as you would expect.  So your bulb must be dead.  Now I wish
someone would explain to me why the clock is in a position which is totally
blocked from view when the shifter is in 3rd and 5th gear!

My 968 has a "Porsche" radio/CD player which came originally with the car.
 This device is lighted only when on, so that it is hard to find at night
when I want to turn it on.  It seems to me that it should be wired so that it
lights up with the rest of the instrument panel lights.  Is yours (or anyone
else's on the list, since I am copying this note to the list) wired like
mine?

Thanks for the 968 production numbers.  Now I know why we see so few 968s
around.
