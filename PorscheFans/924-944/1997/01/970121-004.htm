Well, not really much of an experience, but Sonnen Motors in San Rafael, CA
has a red Boxster on the showroom floor.  Took a look at it on Saturday (so
did about 100 other people).  It was almost like being at an auto
show...there were people lined up just to sit in it.  What was interesting
was the $8,000 "market adjustment" added to the sticker, which pushed the
price well in excess of $50k.  Yikes!

For any 911 turbo fans out there, the dealership also has a 91 911 turbo
(3.3).  The car was absolutely mint, 18k miles, guards red with black
lether & red piping.  18" Speedline 3-piece turbo wheels.  Beautiful.
Price: $55k (somewhat negotiable, I was told).
