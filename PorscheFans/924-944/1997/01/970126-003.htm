As far as the oil changes go, in the U.S. most of our driving is limited to
the "stop" and "go" that are our daily commutes.  On the other hand, should
you have the opportunity to "go" you are likely to get "stopped" by the
bubble gum machine.  I have always heard that Europe offers better chances
to "drive" your car more.  For my car, I have a short ride to work (about 4
miles).  The oil never gets hot enough to blow out all the moisture and
acids.  Excessive idling is another enemy of our engines.

Like I said, using average miles (about 12,000 per year), and standard oil,
it cost less than $1.00 per week to change oil four times a year.  I also
use those intervals to inspect the underside of the car.  It costs only
$50.00 per year, that is the cheapest insurance I know of.  I am not that
tight with my wallet when it comes to protection of my engine.  Why is
there such a stink about trying to save $25.00 to $35.00 a year?  I can't
buy two candy bars a week for extra cost of $3,000 mile oil changes (and
the candy bars are not enamel friendly anyway).

You are right about the gasoline!  I use the higher octane Sunoco, and it
probably isn't necessary, but I have been worried about the varying levels
of true octane at the pumps, and keeping my valves and injectors clean.  I
try to stick with the same station as much as possible, but the gasoline
companies buy there supplies from whomever is cheaper at the time.  Some of
the states mandate the use of ethanol in the gasoline during winter months.
I have heard of surprise pump inspections that turn up inferior octane gas
from time to time.  As far as I know, higher octane fuel does not pose a
threat to the engine.  If gas was priced at the same levels as Europe, I
too, would be more selective about octane.  I am hard pressed to use $15.00
of gas in a week.

This would make a good thread.  Does anyone know more about fuel octane in
the U.S?
