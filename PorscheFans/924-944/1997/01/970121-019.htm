Hi, PorscheFans,

I have a couple of clutch change tips that most of you know already, but may aid the 
first timer.  (I'm doing my clutch right now...first timer!)

Before removing the CV joint bolts, I sprayed them down with CRC Industrial Heavy Duty 
Degreaser in the aerosol can (any degreaser with trichloroethylene will work).  It 
washes away the gunk and evaporates really fast.  I also used a toothbrush to be sure I 
got everything out of the bolt head.  The key is to have an absolutely oil-free bolt and 
tool.  Not one bolt head stripped out on me.

As for the pressure plate bolts, those were a different story.  I stripped out three 
bolt heads.  Heat and an easy-out worked, but don't try to heat the bolt head like I did 
at first.  The heat is absorbed by the pressure plate and never reaches the flywheel.  I 
looked closer and found that the gap between the pressure plate and flywheel was just 
wide enough to get the torch flame onto the bolt shaft were it screws into the flywheel. 
After heating there, the bolts came right out.

I hope this helps someone.

For Sale:  I have a set of four Z-rated Toyo PROXES Z1s, size 225/50-16, for sale.  The 
dealership put them on my car when they bought it.  Unfortunately, the rears should have 
been 245/45-16 and according to the local Toyo dealer, this tire doesn't come in that 
size.  They have a tread depth of 9/32", 1/32" less than the new Goodyears that I 
replaced them with, so I think the mileage on them is fairly low.  I'm asking $300 for 
all four.

Thanks,

Mike Fields
