"To continue with the oil question"

Talked to Tom Charlesworth (PCA National 944 chair) today about the #2 bearing
problem.  Tom was nice enough to take the time to answer my questions.  He was
still working at 7:30 p.m. when I phoned (40 cars in his shop today).  He
indicated that the oil holes on the rod journals are positioned wrong.  He
believes the centrifugal force of the crank at high rpm forces the oil back into
the crank rather than out to the bearings.  His solution is to re-position the
oil hole in the rod journals.  The stock oil holes point 20 or 30 degrees
downward (he couldn't remember exactly), he plugs them and redrills new holes
the same number of degrees upward.  I will look at both the turbo and S2 cranks
tomorrow and have my engine builder call him for exact details (TDC, BDC or ?).
They can argue the engineering points.

He indicated that the Accusump was only effective if it was 2 feet or less from
the engine.  Suggested that I return mine as it will not fit under the hood of a
street car.  

He wasn't familiar with Jon Milledge's air/oil separator for foaming oil.  He
indicated that he runs Redline non-detergent (non-foaming) oil in his race cars,
has no problems but changes the bearings after 40 hrs of track time.

Also talked to Vision Motorsports (yellow 944, Excellence cover) who are
promoting an air-cooled killer turbo, larger injectors and special injector
software.  Out of my budget but interesting.

The Cunningham rods arrived today weeks ahead of schedule.  They are 100 grams
lighter than the stock rods and have been cryogenically stress relieved.  Should
probably hang them on wall rather than hide them in the engine, they look that
good.
