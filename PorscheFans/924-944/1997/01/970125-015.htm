When I moved to the states I was amazed to see how frequently you change your
oil. If you really needed to change your oil at 3000 miles Porsche would have
said so. Back in Europe, where we really get chance to drive, 3000 miles is
unheard of. Often the oil filter is changed every other oil change! If you want
to be careful why not 7500 miles (Thats half! of what Porsche recomends).

Another thing is peoples total lack of comprehension of the gas rating. If your
manual says 89 then 93 is not going to make your car any faster. You are
wasting your money, (which can help with the insurance - or maybe those extra
oil changes ;-) ).

BTW: The 944 S needs gas with a rating of at least 90. If you look around there
are some stations that actually sell this grade instead of 89 as the middle
stuff.

Spend your money on something really good for your car like a set of snow
tires. Lots of fun!
