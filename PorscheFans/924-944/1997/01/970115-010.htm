Fans:

I am looking at an '87 924s as a daily driver. The car has 70K and
appears to be in good to very good condition. The car drove well (even
in -5F temperatures) and was very solid.  The only problem was during
startup were the car ran VERY rich, grey smoke and all. Now, the guy
who started it was pumping the heck out of it as though he were
starting a '65 Plymouth but even so, it seemed like it was excessively
rich. Could the cold have been that much of a factor? Any ideas where
this came from (the car ran well after it warmed up)?

Second, does anyone drive thier cars, 944 or 924 as their driver? What
has been your experience? Any problem areas to look for on the '87s?
Major repairs? How about mileage? Any other advice?

Regards,
Steve
