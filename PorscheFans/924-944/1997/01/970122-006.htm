Hi !

I'm new to this list, but I'll start asking questions right away ! :)

I drive a 1988 924S and I just love it ! However, about a month ago, I
"parked" it against a tree... I was very lucky though because only the
bumper broke (here in Europe we have polyesther (plastic) bumpers !) and
even the headlights were still intact. So I searched for a 2nd hand
bumper and after seeing some real bad and expensive ones, I ran into a
real good one: it was an aluminium one. That must be much stronger and
better I thought, so I bought it. When I came home though I discovered
that it wasn't exactly the same as the original. It was a little smaller
and the headlights didn't fit exactly. I fixed that last problem by making
some modifications, and I now put the bumper on my car. But since it's
somewhat smaller it doesn't really look right. I asked a Porsche dealer
what kind of bumper it could be, he said it was probably from a US 
version. Question: how do you guys have your bumper attached ? A little
more forward ? Some rubber stuff between the bumper sides and the
"wheelcases" (how do you call those things?) ?

Second question: I'm thinking about installing an ABS system from a 944 (S
or S2) into my 924S... has anyone some experience with this ? Looks to me
that everything will fit quite easily...

Thanks !

Au remails !
