here we go again....

I have not owned a 951, although I have driven them, and I do own a 968. Here
is my two bits (in short form, since I did the long one about 2 months ago).
for a mainly track car, if you are not in a race series with lots of
restrictions, the 951 can have its power boosted tremendously without a lot
of money. however, if you are not going to change a lot, the 968 is a much
better daily driver. It has a much flatter power band. It is just easier to
drive daily, and it is no slouch on the track. With equal drivers, and 968
should be slightly faster around a track than a 951 (both stock of course).
the 968 will have a few less HP, but you have it at lower rpm. also, the 968
is newer, so it has more safty features and will be less prone to breakdown
because it is newer. my 2 bits - Doug
