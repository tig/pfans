I just took my 1984 944 to get a major service done yesterday
and the mechanic found out that the water pump is leaking 
onto my brand new belts that the owner before me
just had put on.  The car that I bought is in really good
shape. Just had all of the belts, rollers, motor mounts,
front struts, and transmission just replaced. The car
only has 81,000 miles on it for a '84.  The only thing
that was not replaced was a water pump and now
the car needs one before it causes some major engine 
damage.  My mechanic says that he can save the new belts
(only 3,000 miles on them) and readjust them to the new
water pump, and will put in a new seal kit.  He says
he will do this for $550 including parts and labor.
Does that sound right? Does that sound fair? Does anyone
have any other suggestions? This is the first time I
had to get any work done because the owner before me 
had a  lot of work done beofre I bought it,
and he always had it serviced on time.  Hopefully, this will
be the last time for awhile that I will see my mechanic.
There does not seem that nothing else can break because
everything else is pretty much brand new.

Does anyone have any suggestions on the water pump problem
or the price?

Thanks,

Jeff
