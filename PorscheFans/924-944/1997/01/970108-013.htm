I hate to keep pestering everyone but I have another question.  I got
the camshaft & sprocket fixed today.  It took some handywork of the
lathe and mill but I broached a new keyway in the pully and milled a
keyslot in the cam.  Got it as close as I could (probably within a
degree which is acceptable tolerance)  Anyway I am reassambling now and
as preventitive maint. bought all the new belts.  Camshaft was not a
problem.   The balance belt is really starting to piss me off.  Or I
should say this worthless Haynes manual is.  Before I go through the
song and dance of removing the lower pulley, is the balance belt
referenced specifically to a corresponding time of the crank rotation or
just each other. The dead and wasted tree they call a manual says to
line the marks in the balance shaft sprockets vertical and replace with
the marks I made taking it off.  It does not say anything about A mark
on the crank sprocket or where such a mark would be referenced to if
there was one.  So basically my question is:  Do I line the two marks on
the balance shafts vertically and put the belt on, OR pull the front
sprocket off look for a mark, line it up and put it on with the two
other marks being vertical.  Again thanks for any advice you might have
to offer.
