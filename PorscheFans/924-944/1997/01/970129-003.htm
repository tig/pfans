| there is NO power steering fluid in the car, and I am wondering if there is
| a common point of failure in the PS system on 944's?

Yes, the hoses tend to leak.  Replace the factory clamps with "normal" hose 
clamps and that should fix it.  Plan on spending a good day with the front end 
jacked up and the wheels off, scrubbing with degreaser to clean the PS fluid 
off of *everything*.  If you don't see any, the car was probably steam cleaned 
before they put it on the lot.  This can cover a multitude of sins, so keep a 
sharp eye out the first couple of weeks.

| Also upon closer inspection, the motor mounts seem fine, but the car does
| need a "tune up", it shakes at idle but runs great at anything above ~1000
| RPM  Any specific recommendations for plugs and wires for this car?  And

Shaking at idle is the classic symptom of failed motor mounts.  What do you 
mean when you say they "seem" fine?  The mounts were fluid-filled (latest 
models are solid rubber) and tend to collapse when they fail, so it's usually 
pretty obvious when they're shot.  As far as plugs and wires go, I'd just 
replace the wires with factory parts and go with factory recommendations for 
plugs (Bosch WR7DC, I think).  You can probably find aftermarket wires that 
will work, I just recommend factory parts because I paid the price for going 
with cheap wires once.  Besides, they last for 100K miles or so, so it's not 
like it's a frequent expense.

| I also need parts sources for some minor interior parts (center console for
| a start) and mechanical stuff like a water pump (may as well replace it
| while I'm in there) and the timing belt.

Try George Buselink at 944 Ecology (1-800-ALL-P944) for used parts.  The 
factory prices for some of these things are outrageous (US$700 for the glove 
box door someone said recently!).  For new parts, don't overlook your local 
dealer -- Porsche has a parts campaign in place that offers pretty good prices 
on factory parts.  That said, Vertex and Stoddard also have good prices on 
aftermarket and rebuilt parts.  Pick up a copy of _Excellence_ at the 
newsstand and you'll find a good selection of vendors.

| And one last question... I noticed there is a small exhaust passage which
| runs from the exhaust pipe just behind the O2 sensor into the engine
| compartment.  It is capped off.  Is this normal, or should it be hooked up
| to something like an air pump or EGR? I can't tell if the cap is factory or
| not and it didn't strike me as being right.

I think that's just an exhaust gas sampling port.  It's supposed to be 
plugged, and is used for checking exhaust gas composition during diagnoses and 
the like.

Good luck, and congratulations!
