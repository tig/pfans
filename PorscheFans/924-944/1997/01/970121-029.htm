Now, I know that this isnt really the season to be concerned about this,
but better now than in 100 degree heat. On my 85.5 944 my A/C switch has
ceased to function and I cant figure out why. I bought the car in July
and drove it from California to Wisconsin, and the AC worked just fine
at that time, but about a month into ownership, I found that the AC fan
would not operate in anything but low speed, however the AC unit itself
seemed to be working OK. Then after awhile the fan wouldnt operate at
all. After checking the fuses (the obvious culprit) all of them were OK.
Is this a notorious problem of the beast, or am I just blessed with a
electrical problem that I will never find?? 

Thanx!!
