This is all well and good on an autox course but I think on most if not all
road courses the turbo lag issue is moot because if driven properly the
engine is always turning fast enough that the boost is there practically as
soon as the throttle is cracked.

Having never driven a 968 I am a little uninformed but I know that the
stock 968s don't hold their own very well with the 944 turbos (stock non-S
models) at the track events I've been at.

I'm sure there are a few other opinions out there?
