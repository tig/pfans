My friend has an 89 951 turbo S that pings under boost. It's fine normally but when 
the boost is up, he hears a pinging.	
  His car is modified (chips, cat test pipe, wastegate shims, drilled cycling valve, k & 
N filter) The car was fine when he first put chips in, cat pipe, shims, drilled 
valve, etc. He washed his engine one day, then went out and at redline on the highway he 
heard a pop, like a misfire. Then, no boost the car was slow. He brought it in and found 
that the turbo impellers were eaten up! like a bolt went thru it or something. They 
replaced the turbo, cleaned the intercooler. He's also had 2 wastegates put in. One he 
claims he saw and it was obviously broken. He thought he had it all fixed and then this 
pinging started. He went to a track event and blew a head gasket last year. When he 
brought it in, I think they replaced a valve between the air ducting before the turbo. 
Black round valve.....His car is VERY FAST...but he's afraid it's going to blow another 
head gasket. It's almost like it's overboosted. It seems like too much boost. The 
pinging is what's really bothering him.
  Any thoughts? He knows it's modified, but he wants it to be reliable...
thanks in advance,
Don Thompson
