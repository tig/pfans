     I have to change the oil this weekend and since I have found a whole 
     bunch
     of new friends I would like to ask the age old question. How do you 
     remove
     the oil filter without getting oil everywhere. I have tried directing 
     the
     oil to a container under the car (it works sometimes). I have tried to 
     put
     holes in the filter but it does not empty all of the way. If anybody 
     knows
     please let me know. thanks

     Dave,
     
     I just stuff paper towels under the filter before I remove.  If you 
     remove the plastic under pan it is easier to get the towels under the 
     filter from underneath.  I also remove the power steering fluid fill 
     tank to gain better access to the filter.
     
     I usually spill some oil, but I spend the time to clean it off.  
     That's another reason to remove the bottom pan. 
     
     Just use lots of paper towels and make a cradle for the oil to pool 
     into.  The towels will absorb it if you do it right.
     
     Next change I am going to buy some diapers and try that.  I let you 
     know.
     
     Marv
