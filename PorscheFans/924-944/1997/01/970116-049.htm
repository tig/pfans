Today was around 28-32 (not too bad) then this evening it's coming dooooowwwnnnnn and in the 
middle of the night it should be -10 .. yes it's a negative sign ... not a typo error.

I'm not using my car during the winter  .. I prefer running an econobox all winter long then 
enjoy the Porsche at spring time. But there is quite a few Porschiste around here driving their 
car all winter. The main requirement is a good set of winter tires and a heating system fully 
operational.

Usually we don't have too much problems to get parts ... with the new Porsche PPE progrma it's 
even better coze there is less bargain shopping around. We still have to order parts but the only 
problems is the customs where we get ripped off by UPS with their "custom fees".
Good techs is not a problems ... there is guys specialized in certains areas (suspension setup, 
etc...). You'll find out that there is a lot of Porsche around here .... sure it's not California 
but the people in the Rennsport region are extremely active.
Are you doing track events ..... if not maybe you'll change your mind once you see "Le Circuit" 
at Tremblant. We are going to have once again 4 events this year.

Hope to see you around.
