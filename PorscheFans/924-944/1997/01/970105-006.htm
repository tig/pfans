Last week I test drove a 1986 944 Turbo.  The car had 135,000 miles, but
ran flawlessly through the entire test drive.  I was quite impressed by the
acceleration.  When I opened the hood, to my surprise, the oxygen sensor
was not plugged in.  I reconnected the plug and also observed a broken
wire, which I tentatively repaired.  I restarted the car, but detected no
difference in the overall operation.  I confess that I did not do a road
test.

The question remains, why did this car seem to run so well with the sensor
disconnected?  Should there be a noticeable difference if the sensor is
reconnected?

Any theories?

Marv
