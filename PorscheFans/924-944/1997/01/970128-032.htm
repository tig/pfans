I have an 87 951 with 30,000 miles. My question is this, it seems that my car does not 
launch smoothly unless I rev it up over 3000rpm and slip the clutch. If I try to let the 
clutch out normally at a lower rev, the car shakes and feels as though the clutch is 
grabbing and releasing, grabbing and releasing in quick succession. Other 951's I've 
driven seem easier to start in...
  I'm hoping that my clutch is not going....I did this job in a friends 944S. ;-(  It 
seems to work fine, I've never had any problem shifting gears to make me think that it's 
going bad.(I know that shifting problems are a symptom) On my friends 944S he had 
shifting problems and I could see rubber chunks falling out from the starter hole..His 
rubber center was TRASHED! I believe my turbo has spring center disk.
  Only other thing I can think of is that clutch disk has oil on it but I see no oil 
leak and it's not getting worse...Just keeps jerking upon startup unless I rev and slip 
clutch......  

 Also, when I first start out, in 1st gear when I'm slipping the clutch, I hear a rattle 
noise from under the engine. Sounds like a muffler shield or something. I have driven 
the car with the under panels (aluminum and plastic) off and I hear the same thing. All 
muffler shield are perfect an dnot loose. I have been all over the engine and can find 
NOTHING loose.... I did notice however that the  exhaust pipe (i think coming down from 
turbo....it's been awhile since i've looked and it's cold in garage!) is very close to 
the frame below the drivers foot area. In fact, you can see that it has hit there....
  Could this bee the source of my rattle? Has anyone else experienced this closeness of 
pipe to frame? 	
  My thought is that perhaps the drivers side motor mount is bad? I believe the 
passenger side(which goes bad more often) has been replaced and there is no shaking to 
make me think that they are bad but why else would this pipe be so close and potentially 
hit the frame?
  Any thoughts from fellow 944 drivers with similar situations would be appreciated.
thanks,
Don Thompson
