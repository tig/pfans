Can any one help?

I have recently restored a 1978 924 (LHD 2Ltr Injection) the car had been
standing for 4 years prior to me purchasing it. The fuel/gas tank was flushed
as the fuel was brown in colour. I have had the injectors cleaned, new warmup
reg, new fuel filter however, there are still problems with the running of the
car. The petrol is now clear and free from contamination.

The problems are as follows:
1) Difficlt to start when cold - the engine turns over and starts, runs for a
few second and stops. This happens a few time and eventually it will run but
ticks over at 400 rpm. If you touch the accelerator, it will stall. As it gets
warmer it runs better however, it is very sensitive to the accelerator being
pressed. When warm it ticks over at 950 rpm.

2)When warm the car runs quite well however, there is a lack of power. The car
will not rev above 4,500 rpm (1st gear) 4,000 rpm (2nd & 3rd) and 3,500 (4th)
It seems that there is a miss fire - like a rev limiter cutting-in. I do know
there is not a rev limiter on the car and suspect there is a fuel starvation
problem somewhere.

3).The fuel pump some times make a strange noise and the reading on the voltage
meter increases to 16 volts. This occurs every five/ten minutes and lasts for
about a minute.

If anyone could help please contact me.

Any ideas on problem number 3. Is the fuel pump or alternator at fault or both?
