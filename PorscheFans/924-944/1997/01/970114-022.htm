Hi fellow P-fans,

Well, from the look of things I have a problem.

Sunday I checked my oil level. Funny, it seems to have gone UP! When I 
looked underneath the oil cap (I always check for burnt residue), I 
found a milky white substance. It was also in the tube that comes up 
from the motor.

My guess - coolant in the oil.

I understand that this is caused by leaking seals in the oil cooler. I 
checked the Haynes manual, and it seems like a straight forward job with 
the motor out of the car.

But can it be done with the motor in the car? My guess is yes. A visual 
inspection shows that it is almost definitely necessary to remove the 
exhaust manifold. That done - it can't be too bad.

Some questions:

1. Do I need to drain the oil and coolant first?

2. I counted the following bits that need to be replaced:
	1	oil cooler gasket
	2	oil-cooler O-ring	(I'm guessing)
	2	oil-coller seal		(I'm guessing)
	1	rubber mount
	1	relief valve sealing ring
	1	relief valve O-ring
	1	relief vavle plug gasket
	1	oil filter boss gasket
   Is that all? Do these come in kits from the dealer?

3. What about the oil-pressure relief valve. The leaking problem is 
fairly new -- does this REALLY need to be changed?

If anybody has any experience or tips on how to best accomplish this I 
would be really happy to hear from you. And of course if you want to 
help - come on over - beer is on me (after the job is done).

TIA,

Tim Betteridge
