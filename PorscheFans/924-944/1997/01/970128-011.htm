Hi All, 
        I have put a 968 spoiler on my 944.  Actually it was the spoiler
for Porsche's ill fated 968 Turbo RS, but the attaching scheme is the same
as a stock 968 spoiler.  Unfortunately, you need a lot of parts to do this
correctly, and these parts are very expensive even for Porsche.  Besides
the wing itself you'll need p/n 951-512-406-00-03c right spoiler molding w/
951-512-605-01 gasket, 951-512-405-00-03c left spoiler molding w/
951-512-606-02-01c gasket, 951-512-103-00-03c rear (center) spoiler molding
w/ 951-512-603-00 gasket. Installation may require drilling different holes
in the window frame (this part is no big deal).
        The only practical way to do this unless you're rich is to find a
complete hatch from a 968 or a '91 944S2.  This won't be easy to find.
        What I did was to have a friend fabricate some pieces out of
aluminum for these molding pieces.  For a track car this was ok, but
probably wouldn't look good enough or seal well enough for a street car.
        PCA Club Racing has decreed that this wing for me is no longer
legal so I'll have to go the stock spoiler.  This is a rule chang I totally
agree with.
        Hope this info helps anybody contemplating this change before you
get in too deep.
