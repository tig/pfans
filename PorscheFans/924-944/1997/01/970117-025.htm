	This is probably coming a bit late but...I don't know, man. It's
	pretty hard to get a "deal" on something like this where Porsches
	are involved. The difference between what you'd pay for this car
	(1500 or 2 grand, maybe) and what you'd pay for a cherry 84 (6 or
	7K, maybe) would be worth the potential nightmares that may occur
	with this car. To me, anyway. Owning a Porsche is not about
	cutting corners. Save your money and do it the right way.
