Jonathan & members,

Thanks for your reply and info. I called the Princeton Porsche dealer 
concerning the manifolds upgrade. Well I was shocked! Here is how it 
breaks down:
With 130,000 miles, calling the PCNA rep for compensation is probably a 
long shot.

951.111.131.05 exhaust manifold 1,4 @ $  807.93 
951.111.133.04 exhaust manifold 2,3 @ $  807.93
951.111.096.09  exhaust cross pipe  @ $ 1130.22
951.107.065.02 heat shield          @ $   55.00
12 hrs. labor @ $60.00/hr           @ $  720.00

                                total $ 3521.08 (does not include 
gaskets, seals &
                                                 hardware)            


also the following is required:

944.111.196.00 gasket-exhaust (4 required)
944.111.205.04 seal ring (3 required)
931.123.195.00 seal ring (1 required)
944.110.163.00 gasket-intake (4 required)

also these hardware parts may be rusted and seized:

999.062.044.02 stud (8 required)
999.084.052.02 locking nut (14 required)
928.111.181.00 washer (8 required)
900.074.268.02 bolt hex head ( 6 required)
  N.011.525.17 washer (13 required)
  N.010.020.2  bolt-hex head (4 required)
900.075.420.02 bolt-hex head (4 required)
  N 900.730.01 locking nut (3 required)
999.084.051.02 locking nut (3 required)
900.074.267.02 bolt hex head (3 required)

    NOTE 1. The above listed parts are Porsche list.
    

  I just thought that other list members would be interested in this 
parts list.

  If your car was modified before the 50,000/5 year "hidden" warranty you 
would not have to deal with any of this mess. To see if your 951 has the 
upgrade, check out the exhaust manifold for accordian type folds on the 1 
& 4 pipes. If you have these the previous owner was aware of the service 
bulletin (#8711, 9.21.87, Technical Bulletins book D # PNA 000 062) and 
took care of the defect. Usually the cross was upgraded at the same time, 
but don't count on it! In addition, this upgraded 2 part cross pipe saves 
aprox. 5 hours on a clutch job because the clutch housing cannot be 
removed, without first removing the crosspipe. The older version (1 part 
cross pipe) requires removing the crosspipe from the turbo, which in turn 
requires the extraction of several parts to get to those hard to reach 
turbo exhaust nuts.(951 owners should know this rule: for every part you 
need to replace you will remove at least 5 more.)  

The upgraded 2 piece crosspipe seperates (to the wastegate), facillating 
the easy removal of the housing, thus leaving the turbo exhaust pipe 
connected.

Sorry, I got a little side tracked here. This is just one of the reasons 
why it requires big $$$$ of maintainence, (even if you are your own 
mechanic) to keep that turbo running to spec.
The way it drives and handles makes it all worth it does'nt it ??

PS. You should see what it takes to replace the clutch!

Comments are welcome!
