	Well, a built-up 944 would be pretty obvious so I don't
	think you need to worry about that. Nor should you worry
	about a stripped down 951. Your biggest worry would probably
	be getting a worn-out, beat up 951. You can avoid this nasty
	situation by doing several things; make sure the car has service
	records. Go the the shop where it's been serviced and ask them
	what they think of the car. Have *your* shop perform a pre-
	purchase inspection, too. It's very helpful (and a good sign) if
	the owner of your future car is a PCA member. Do these things and
	you'll be fine. Good luck!
