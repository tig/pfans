	Michael,

	You might consider getting a Valuation Form for it from the PCA.
	There's an ad in just about every Pano for them (they're somewhere
	in California, I forget exactly where) but this is exactly the
	sort of document that will help you back up your claim to the
	insurance company if disaster strikes. A good shop that knows
	Porsches can be a big help, too.
