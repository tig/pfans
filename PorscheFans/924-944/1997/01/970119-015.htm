Hi James,
In the words of my mechanic here in Annapolis, "these cars are more or 
less bulletproof".  Particularly the normally aspirated breed.  After 
two years with a 1978 924 whose electrical system had been tampered with 
and just would not behave, my mechanic convinced me that my money would 
be better invested in a 944.  Today I have an 85.5 944 5-speed with over 
313,000 original miles and no rebuild in sight (40mpg hwy/ 32mpg cty).  
Needless to say, I change my oil if the wind blows and heed ALL 
recommendations concerning belts, filters, and water pump.

The most important step toward insuring years of trouble-free motoring 
is making sure that you settle for nothing less than a complete 
documented history of any car you buy.  Any car without proper records 
of major services is an unfathomable risk.  People who buy such cars 
more than once (the maximum allowable) deserve whatever they get.

Best of Luck.  Now go change your oil.
Dave C.
