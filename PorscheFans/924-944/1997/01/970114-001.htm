My silver '84 944 has very few resident Porsche gremlins and no serious
problems. Never let me down. It is well cared for and has just crossed
the 100k mile mark. 

Last winter for the first time the motor developed an intermittent hiccup
in -12F weather. It felt like a fuel pump problem or electrical problem,
with the revs falling and coming back up very quickly. This would never
happen at startup (still amazes me how a 12-year old car, at -10F can
start up at the first crank after sitting in the snow for a month), only
after driving for more than 20 minutes. And equally promptly it would go
away. At the time I checked the cap and rotor for water, plugs and the
fuel pump and filter, and came up with no explanation. 

The problem disappeared come spring, and appeared once in March on a 5,000
mile drive to California from Washington state. Since then the car has a
new cap, rotor, plugs, fuel filter. The hiccup reappeared this winter,
very short, jerky losses of power on the highway. Never actually died,
more like somebody was squeezing the fuel line for nano-seconds at a time.
The only thing I can think of are the ignition wires, which are 100,000
miles old. Since there is negligible loss of HP in a test, would the old
wires cause this strange malady. Are the hiccups a precursor to worse
things? Is my trusty 944 finally about to roll over and play dead?
