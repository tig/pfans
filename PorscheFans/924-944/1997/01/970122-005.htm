I'm an American who recently moved to the Fatherland.  My '79 924 is
currently sitting quietly in Michigan, awaiting some clutch and gearbox
work (as well as a nice coat of paint)
I have checked out the 924s storming around the streets here in Wiesbaden
and have noticed few differences between them and the U.S. spec (although I
know they have all about 10-20 more ponies pumping)

My question simply is, what would it cost and how would I go about bringing
the car over here?

I will be here for a while, I hope, and should I want ot sell the car I
know I could get more for it here than in the U.S.

Does anyone know what happens with the wonderfurl German TU"V?
Import tax?
Shipping?
Any help would be greatly appreciated...
Thanks in advamce..
Andy

That's a ONE after the arp!
:)
