Actually, they are not grenades as the boost pressure makes them out to be.
The 20G turbocharger (the biggest, baddest turbo for the Talon) is about the
same size as a K27-6, the only difference is that they run a 7cm housing,
so effectively a K27-7, so 20psi is not all that much when you look at the
CFM ratings.  The 14B turbo (stock) flows 390cfm @ 15psi, the 16G (the
one I ran and run on my teamates car) flows 550cfm @ 15psi and the 20G
flows 650cfm @ 15psi, so as you can see, boost pressure really means 
nothing.

Smaller motors also tolerate a lot more boost pressure than do large
displacement motors, for whatever reason (probably effective compression
ratio or something like that).

The motors don't break, everything else around the motor does, but the motor
does not break.  The first thing to go when things do go south are the piston
rings.  I don't think I've ever seen any of the Talon racers, even the road
racers blow a head gasket, ever.  These guys also don't just drag race, they
daily drive their cars, so reliability is key, but they don't do wide open
throttle around a road race track for 40 minutes at a time, at least not
without race gas.

Farzaan.
