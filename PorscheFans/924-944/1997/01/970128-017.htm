Just a tip for those with "boost problems."  Back 1 1/2 years ago when I bought 
my '89 951, I installed the Autothority chip set.  About a week later, I began 
to have boost problems.  Basically, without warning, I'd get a situation where 
the boost was limited to .2 - .3 bar (1.2 - 1.3 on the gauge) and performance 
of course was off.  The problem wouldn't go away unless I powered down the car 
for awhile.  It would always eventually come back.  The car had about 18,000 
miles, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a fuel problem.

I took my time troubleshooting this problem as I was busy converting my '87 951 
to Turbo S specs, and typically was driving it more regularly.  I talked to a 
number of friendly experts, including Mr. Charlesworth (PCA Tech expert) who 
suggested that I read the appropriate troubleshooting section in my factory 944 
Turbo service manual supplement.  Although I had already read this section, my 
interest was only passing, since the procedures required a special tool which I 
did not own, and was sure was expensive.  Mr. Charlesworth pointed out that the 
tool could be had at a dealer for less than $40 ($20 - $30 I think).

Well, I bought the tool and followed the procedures, which called for the tool 
to be plugged into a diagnostic socket not too far away from the brake master 
cylinder.  The tool indicated a special "blink code" that helped me nail down 
the problem.  When reinstalling the KLR, I had inadvertantly caused the 
vaccuum/boost line to be pinched.  This apparently caused the KLR to go into a 
fault detection mode, and subsequently limit the maximum boost.  Problem solved.

I carry the tool and the supplement with me when I go to the track with the 
'87, just in case.  The troubleshooting section is really quite good.

Hope this info helps.
