Hey guys,

Had a really bad night last night.  Driving down a road I've travelled
about a million times in the past about three blocks from my house.
It was pouring rain last night, probably harder than I'd ever seen.
All of a sudden, we were thigh deep in water!!!  Because of all the horror
stories I'd heard of people getting water into their engines and bending
rods, I immediately put the clutch in and shut the car off.  Opened the
door and tons of water came in.  This was getting ugly.  We pushed the
car through this lake to the other end where it was dry.  This was a relief
until we realized there was another lake after this dry spot that was at
least 1ft deeper!  So, we turned it around and pushed it through Hell Lake
again to the other dry patch.  A fellow in a pick up truck came through
and didn't notice the 3ft of water either and splashed the hell out of
us.  He did stop though to lend me a screwdriver so I could open the
air filter housing to see if any water had gotten in.  The filter,
and the housing were completely dry, not even a drop.  

It was still pouring out so I got back in, turned it on and drove
it home very slowly.  There is a slight vibration at idle and throughout
the rev band now though.  I think it's a damanged motor mount or maybe
the balance shaft belt skipped a couple of teeth when I shut the motor
off while it was still turning 2000rpm or so, or maybe the water pushed
the engine up enough to bend a heat shield or something.

While we were pushing the car, we saw a RX-7TT come into this lake.  He
didn't shut the car off, when the car hit the water, his air damn just fell
off and he drove over it!  Then his car started to sputter and tons of
white smoke out the exhaust and boom, the car died and wouldn't restart.

So, anyhow, the car is at the shop right now getting the vibration dealt
with as well as an oil change and an underbody inspection.  I'll keep
you informed of the progress.  Anybody have this happen to them before?
Any ideas what the vibration may be (it sounds like an exhaust leak, but
feels like a constant vibration)?  Email me private too because I'm on
the digest.

Farzaan.
