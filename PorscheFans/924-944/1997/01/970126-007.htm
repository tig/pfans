Hello All,

Once again I would like to hear the experiences of fellow Porsche owners
performance modifications.  I have read the books and catalogs for ideas,
and would love to hear from any owners on the following mods.

First, my car is a 86 951,  lowered,  higher rate springs 260lb/in f,  29mm
rear, performance valved shocks, stock anti-sway bars,  soon to be modified
engine (exhaust, chips,  possible Mass Flow conversion, etc).  

Being that I suffer from Tinkeritis,  the overwhemling desire to never leave
well enough alone, never to have extra money or time, and the constant
feeling of - Ohh, this is much better,  but if I just did this and this...)
I am curious about following:

Tires:          Budget allows for one of the two following choices in
225/50/16 front                   and 245/45/16 rears.
                        
                        Bridgestone RE-71's or Dunlop D40M2's
                        - Overall Traction vs Treadlife?
                        - Ride Quality
                        - Wet traction

Front Strut Bar:        They look cool... But do they really help turn-in
and general                           steering feel?


Exhaust:                Looking to reduce turbo lag,  and increase HP
                        -  Cat test pipe (no enviro counseling please)
                        -  Different brands of exhaust 
                        -  Custom exhaust (stock pipe with a Flowmaster muffler)
                        -  My car is as quiet as a Honda (this is not a good
thing!)
                        
Mass Flow Conversion:
                       (I have received a few responses on this one (Thank
You!))
                        -  Has any one built a custom system (using a
Ford/GM sensor)?
                        *-  Did this conversion reduce turbo lag,  increase
throttle                                response,  increase horspower, make


you more attractive to                              big - haired women?
                        -  Who has the best prices?

Turbo Upgrades/Revisions:
                        - See the * comment above


Rear Seat Removal:      Little children shouldn't ride with me,  so why
carry this extra                         weight?  Has anyone seen a carpet
kit for this?

Short Shift Kits:       ?

Any Secrets of Speed that I have missed?

If you have even read this far,  I am grateful.  And, I if you wouldn't mine
responding, I will be eternally grateful!

Thanks Again,

Eric Blackburn
