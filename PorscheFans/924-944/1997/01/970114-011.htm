I don't know what you mean by "cold".  It has been beyond thirty below 
here...

To answer your first question, as long as the car develops oil pressure
and runs smoothly, go ahead.  A secondary suggestion, however, is that
you should subsequently drive far enough for the car to warm up fully.
This has less to do with running than it does with driving off moisture and
condensation completely.  Therefore, if you have a five minute drive to 
work, warm it up for a while.  If you drive thirty minutes, get in and drive.

Regarding the stalling, it might indeed be that the battery was down, 
and Motronics are sensitive to low batteries.  It might also be your charging
system.  If you have enough poop to start the car, but the alternator
does not kick in, the car could do this on a cold morning.  Sadly, it
needs to become more chronic before you can be sure.

All of this points towards having the electrical system in top shape for
cold winter driving.

>Hello P-Fans,

>I have two questions:

>1.  What is the proper method for starting my 944 on a cold winter
>morning?  Is it good for the car to allow it to warm up for awhile prior to
>driving it or should I just get in, start it up and drive?

>2. The reason for question 1 is that I allowed my car to warm up this
>morning and next thing I know, the car starts to sputter and then stalled. 
>When I tried to start the car, it acted as if the battery was completely
>dead and wouldn't even turn over.  If I let the car set for a few minutes, it
>would try to start and then nothing.  I decided to give it a jump start and it
>worked.  However, if I let the car idle to long, it would sputter again and
>stall.  Finally, after I jump started the car the second time, I had to get in
>the car right away and take off.  Now everything is O.K.  I've had the car
>for a year now and this only happened to me one other time but then I
>had the timing belt, water pump, balance shaft belt, etc  replaced and it
>never happened again until this morning.  
>
>I find it hard to believe that it is my battery because the car started right
>up this morning without a problem.  I would appreciate any insights to
>what the problem may be.
