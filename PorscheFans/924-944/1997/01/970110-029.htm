	Would this happen to be the Thomas C. Nelson that owned an
	Azure Blue 1987 944 and traded it in on a 968 at Park Place
	Porsche in Dallas? If it is, I own your old 944! Thanks for
	taking such excellent care of it. It was in truly incredible
	shape when I bought it (and still is, btw). What a strange
	place the world can be sometimes...
