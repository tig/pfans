It can be repaired.  Usually one of the gears inside the speedo have slipped
out of their holders, thus rendering the odometer useless.  You have to remove
the speedometer.  To do that, remove steering wheel, and the control stalks.
 (the haynes manual has methods to do this).  Unscrew the two screws from the
instrument cluster.  (They are in side the instrument wells, not the two holes
that look like they may be screw covers).  You can know slowly pull the entire
instrument cluster slowly out a little ways.  Pull it just enough to get your
hand back there to unscrew the speedo cable (you should be able to do it by
hand) and unplug the wires.  If you have a mpg gauge, you'll have to unplug it
from the tachnometer (the other end is screwed onto the speedometer).

Pull/push the speedometer out the front of the plastic cluster holder.  Do not
push it through the back, this will crack the cluster holder.

To open it, pry open the metal lip of the plastic window from around the
speedo.  Remove the needle, and face.  Unscrew the screws from the back of the
speedo to release the mechanicals.

Now that you have the mechanicals.  Decide to put it back together, stick it
back in the car and live with it.  Go buy a refurbished speedo, and trade your
new one in and sell the car with 0 miles.  Or attempt to find what is wrong
with the odometer.

Either way, the odometer has stopped, thus ruining the true mileage of your car
and decreasing its value.  :(

Good luck!!
