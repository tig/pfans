Hi Surya,

They all seem to be a little different. Most that I've driven release 
towards the top of the pedal. As long as there is no slippage (especially
when hot) I wouldn't worry about it.

At the lower front part of the brake fluid reservoir is a hose that leads
down to the clutch master cylinder. Bleeding one has no effect on the
other. That is unless you let the level in the reservoir drop low enough
to allow air into the system. Bleeding the clutch is a PIA. You have
to put the car up on jackstands, and remove the starter (Kevin Gross
says that he doesn't have to remove the starter, but there was no way
I could get a wrench up there with the starter in place). At the rear
of the clutch slave clyinder is the bleed nipple. Bleed the clutch by
opening the nipple and have someone step on the clutch pedal. Proceed
just like brake calipers. Just be careful that you don't suck air into
the system. The area of the brake fluid reservoir that supplies the clutch
master has a little plasic shield that can prevent the reservoir from
getting refilled. For that reason, I like to have the rear of the car
higher than the front.

Bleeding the clutch shouldn't have any affect on the clutch pedal feel,
unless there was air in the system.
 
> And about oil changes, isn't it safer to go by the amount of abuse the oil

My own personal belief on oil changes is that too much of a deal is
made about it. If Porsche says you can go 15K miles without a change,
that has to mean something. Personally, I change my oil at least twice
a year, at the beginning of the season, midway through the season
if I've done a lot of driving, and at the end of the season. 

To each his own.
