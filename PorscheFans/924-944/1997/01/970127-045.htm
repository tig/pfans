I have just reread an article in the May, 1996 issue of european car on
bolt on modifications for the early 924is.  In the article a reference
is made to an article that would appear, iin the next issuei, regarding 
power increases available from using a reworked cylinder head with
larger valves.  I looked through the June issue of european car and can
not find the article.

Does any one on the list know if this article was ever published, and if
so when and what the conclusions were?

There was a follow-up article. The new head made a significant difference.
Along with the other bolt-on stuff they brought HP up to that of a 944! They
didn't publish the price of the trick head, but I'm sure that by the time
they finished with everything it cost more than an older 944 or 924S. The
biggest lap time improvements came from tire/wheel/suspension improvements
(over 4 sec/lap). You'll get most of these improvements with a 944/924S.
