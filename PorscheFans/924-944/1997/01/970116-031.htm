Surya,

Could be the fuel pump relay. I have heard of many cases where this goes 
intermittent. I think it's fairly cheap. 

Another possibility is the reference marker switch on the flywheel. This 
is a switch that relays position information to the DME. The switch 
usually fails altogether and the car won't run, but it can start by 
going intermittent.
