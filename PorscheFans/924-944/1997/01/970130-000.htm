Dear Andrew,

After recently overheating my 77 924 (non-turbo) so hot I vaporised
fuel in the injector lines I decided to completely overhaul the cooling system.
My radiator was 60% blocked with crap (which I knew) a $50 cleanout fixed it
(not a flush but tanks off and re-soldered). Replaced all the hoses,
fixed the cracked thermostat housing etc. Even after all this it was still
running way too hot even on cool days, although recently here in Perth it's
been in the high 30's. I figured out that the thermo fan is coming on too late,
ie. by the time it switches on the water temp is already past the threshold
level that the fan can cool.
So I wired up the fan so it's on whenever the ignition is on.
On my car you can't just short out the radiator temp sender, the fan will always
come on, so I wired up a relay that switches on the fan voltage when ever
the key is on.
Just find any accessory fuse that only works when the key is on. You only
need a small current
to trip the relay. The best would be to wire it up to the fuel pump so it
only runs
when the engine is on.
Now my car rarely gets over the first notch on the temp gauge.
