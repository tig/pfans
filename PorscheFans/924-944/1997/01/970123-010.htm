Greetings from the frozen midwest! I need some help with
the 1985 1/2 944 I just bought...I thought I could pick the
minds of the experts here...

1. My console has the three toggle switches on the left, one
for mirror, one for roof and one for rear wiper. On the same
row on the far left I have a dial with arrows on it, the icon looks
like a speaker. Any ideas what it is for?

2. The former owner lost the alarm key. Local key shop says if
I get the number off the back of the lock they can make a key. Any
idea how to get to the rear of that lock, which as you know is
on the driver's side rear panel? Can I take some interior
panels out enough to read the number? Any other way to get
the key?

3. Any recommendations on floor mats? I need some. I have no idea what
the stock ones look like, so don't know if I want those or others. Can anyone
tell me what the stock front mats look like? Plain black or what? My interior
is black.

Thanks for any help!
