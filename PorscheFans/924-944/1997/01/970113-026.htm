If you don't have concrete evidence of when the belts were
changed, then change them immediately.

Keep the evidence so the next buyer will know when they need
to be replaced.

The belt service is:
1) change them now.
2) have them retensioned in 1500 miles from now.
3) have them retensioned in 15000 miles from now.
4) change them at 30000 miles from now.


Good Luck!
