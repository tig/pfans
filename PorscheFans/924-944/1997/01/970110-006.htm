I'm surprised no one has thought of this:

This leads me to think the coolant is bad, and has frozen. All the symptoms
lead to frozen coolant - car used to work fine, outside temperature below
freezing (way below in this case), and now car overheats, but blows cold air.
Hopefully, the engine has not been damaged by frozen, expanded coolant.
Are there 'freeze out' plugs in the 944 block?
