David,

I guess I could show you my parts database that shows all the parts I have
replaced on each model in my shop.   Beg to differ on the pressure regulators.
They go out all the time, and they start show symptoms just like yours.  If
the pump were bad, you would never start.  Same with the relay.

As for the gauge, absolutely yes.   That is the place to START with any
fuel problem.   You should see the problem even before you have the
symptoms.   Example:   In order to start quickly and avoid vapor lock,
the system needs to retain some pressure, usually about 15 psi.   If you
do not retain that pressure, your cold starting will be ok, but warm starting
(after the car sits a while) can be horrible.   This is because the
unpressurized
fuel has flashed to vapor and won't readily go through the injectors.  
Classic vapor lock.   Epidemic in CIS systems, and frequent in DMEs.
Don't throw parts at the car until you have a reason.

Good luck.

Dave
