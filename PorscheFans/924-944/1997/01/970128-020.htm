A Flowmaster muffler is designed to provide adequate backpressure for 
normally aspirated cars as well as providing good flow (aka better than
stock).  For a turbocharged application, the stock muffler is probably
better.  The only thing that may give the Flowmaster the characteristic
of giving more power is if its inlets and outlets are also 4" and therefore,
the entire muffler flows more than the stock muffler which seems to be
2.5".  Now, for ultimate performance out of a turbo car, you want no
muffler, the least back pressure, the better boost response you'll have,
*but* most people don't want to drive around with noise, even though as
Steve mentioned, turbochargers themselves do a good job of muffling.  The
best muffler to run is a straight through (see your hand at the other
end) large diameter unit, like a Dynomax Ultraflow or Borla XR-1, the
Flowmaster is *not* a particularly good choice as you have to go to
large diameters to achieve the same reduction in back pressure as a smaller
diameter straight through muffler.

Don Thompson,
In regards to your friend's pinging 951:  Get a boost guage from your
local hick store and tie it into any of the various vacuum line from
the intake manifold.  This will tell you immediately what boost he's
running.  I've found that mine runs at 14.5-15.0psi and then tapers
down to 12-13psi in first and second gear.  In third, it holds 14.5-psi
right up to redline.  This is with chips.  I believe stock chips are
supposed to be 12-13psi and then they dip down to 11.5psi.  Some people
who have the JME or Weltmeister chips run as high as 15-16psi (1.1bar).

There are quite a few 944 Turbo owners out here in B.C. that don't
quite understand how turbos work.  They take their car to a performance
shop which installs the chips and then a dial-a-boost.  The shop
sets the boost at 1bar (14.7psi) and then the owner races his buddy in
his new Vielside 690hp Toyota Supra.  As the Supra starts to beat him,
he starts to turn the dial, at first it feels really good, he might have
a chance, and then the timing feels like it's backing down, then the
temps start to rise as the timing is retarded so severly, it's causing
overheating and then pow, usually these idiots luck out and just blow
a head gasket, in other cases, I've seen blown piston rings (this is
really ugly!) and also as frequent as head gaskets are exhaust valves
that get burnt from the lean mixture.

If you are going to play with boost, get an exhaust temperature guage
(you want it to be 1350 degrees F after the turbo) or an A/F mixture
guage (most turbo cars like 13:1 for best power, but 12.5:1 for better
reliability).  

Farzaan.
89 951 - 14psi (maybe 15-16 soon).
