All, 
        One day while driving my 87 924S down the road with windows and
sunroof open, enjoying the nice day, I got an empty beer bottle thrown at me
by an Isuzu Trooper full of young , black, males.  To this day I cannot
figure out why they did it.  Luckily  Isaw the bottle coming and avoided it,
but it came danm near to smashing my winshield.  I have also been given the
bird and yelled at when at a stop light.  Is it that people envy the fact
that I have a Porsche, or has some single jerk Porsche driver poisoned
everyone against us?  Also, I seem to get every redneck and his brother will
a beat up 280Z trying to race me at every stop light.  I usually let it go,
I figure I might lose. (unless I am in my 305 V8 powered Olds Cutlass, then
I eat them alive!)
