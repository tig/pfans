My car is fitted with the Euro fog/driving lights.  They were installed
immediately prior to my purchase and have never worked properly (the fog
light portion works fine, but the driving lights don't work at all).
The PO said there was a short and offered to fix it, but I wanted to
take the car that day and so I told him that I would take care of it.  

I am (finally) going to take a look into this problem, but I have a
question:  How are these supposed to work?  The fog light switch is a
two position unit (on/off) rather than the three position I expected
(fog lights on/driving lights on/off).  Do I have the right switch
installed?  If I do, then is proper operation as follows:

With the fog light switch in the on position, the fog lights turn on
with the parking lights and/or low beams.  The driving lights take over
with the brights.

Please cc me on any replies as I am on the digest.

Thanks,
John
