Hi all,

This past summer I had my rollers changed for my belts.  After they were
changed, my belts have become louder than ever.  I took it back to have them
check the tension, after two weeks, they hadn't checked the tension so I took
my car back.  (this is the same garage that replaced my battery that died
there, then didn't secure the new one down, just dumped it in on top of the
mounting hardware).  I checked the tension myself (my handy dandy neighbor has
the little expensive tool), it was fine.  The car has been sittin in my garage
for a few months now (undriven), I drove it last Friday and the belts were
whining loud as ever.  Sounded nice with the clacking hydraulic lifter...

This weekend I'm going to remove all belts and check the rollers.  What should
I look for to determine if the rollers are bad or good?  From what I know about
ball bearings (it's all ball bearings these days) they should have any lateral
play, and should turn freely...

Thanks!!
