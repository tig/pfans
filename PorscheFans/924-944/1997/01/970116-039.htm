Hey dudes,

I just got off the phone with a friend of mine who was having his Eagle
Talon AWD dyno tested.  Thought you guys might be interested in some of
the results.  To dyno test it, they had to replace the transmission with
a front wheel drive unit.  The car is running the exact same products that
my previous car had except it has a larger turbocharger and a larger
intercooler.

The turbo should be worth about 30hp at the wheels and the larger intercooler
doesn't make any HP difference in short burts of power.  On long burts,
the large front mount he uses over the upgraded side mount I used has the
benefit of getting rid of heat better.  Well, here is the wheel dyno figures
that came from his car running 114 octane unleaded race gas and 20psi of
boost:
   
413hp @ 6200rpm
390lbs-ft of torque (I can't remember what the rpm was, but it was pretty
high.

WOW, I was pretty stunned.  Makes the Powerhaus 944 look tame in comparison.
By the time you get all the power through all four wheels and propell the
pig of a car (3300lbs), the advantage does diminish, but it's neat to see
a 2.0L 4-cylinder turbo produce numbers like that.  His best 1/4 mile
run was 11.88 @ 117mph.  The fastest Talon owned by Dave Buschur runs
11.09 @ 123mph.  I wonder what his wheel HP would be!

Both cars have been very reliable for these guys, but then they don't run
road race after road race after road race like you guys do.  Drag racing is
hard on a car, but doesn't really test the long term reliability of a car
like track events do.

Anyhow, enough about that car, on February 16, there is an autocross event
at Bremerton raceway.  I believe it's about a 3-4 hour drive from here and
I'm thinking of making the treck out there if other Porsche guys also show
up to race.  Any takers?

Farzaan.
1989 944 Turbo S - 14psi.
Burnaby, B.C. Canada.
