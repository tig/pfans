The new rollers are greased so they will not spin freely.  There should be
absolutely no radial nor axial play.  The one sign of trouble is a
"clicking" sensation that is more felt than heard.  Other than that, check
for visual problems.  Perhaps the noise is caused by an improperly placed
idler roller (the smooth ones)...?
