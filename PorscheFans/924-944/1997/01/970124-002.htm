Thanks to those who responded to my offer of the fiche and reader, I received
more response than I had anticipated.  Jeff, the lucky winner made out big time,
the UPS cost me $17!  

For those of you who missed out, give your local P dealer a call for the
microfiche:

924s/944 to 1989 manual, PNA000127, Retail $18, PCA discount $15.50

944 Turbo supplement, PNA000126, $8.50 PCA discount $7.25

Technical bulletins, all Porsches, Retail $18, discount $15.50

As for readers, I talked to the guy at the end of our complex that I got the
reader from.  He buys equipment from businesses that are shutting down.  This
week he is going to look at a bank that is closing and thinks they may have some
readers.  I have saved your faxes and will let you know what he comes up with.

Those new to the list should consider buying the water cooled parts manual
(actual paper), PNA000147A, $9.95 retail, $8.46 discount.  Has all the W/Cs in
El Explodo pictures with part numbers.  When you have that pile of parts on your
floor and have brain fade, this book may save you.  Not every part is listed but
it is still the deal of the year.  The FAQs are on George (Daytona bound) B's
home page, punch in 944 Ecology into search and you should find it.
