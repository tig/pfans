Hi All,

This weekend I am planning to pull the head on my car and
replace the head gasket and head studs.  The motor made
124K miles on the original gasket, and, sorry to say, but
my driving style might have more than a little to do with
it going.  The operation seems straightforward enough,
but are there any caveats?  

I plan to replace the belts while I'm in there.  What about
the pump?  It was replaced about 30K miles ago, but the
car seems to have a cooling problem.  I replaced the 
thermofan switch and am now leaning towards replacing the 
oil/coolant heat exchanger seal and the waterpump as well.
I want to do the job correctly the first time and avoid 
having to go through this again any time soon.  I have 
purchased a wide fire ring gasket, Raceware head studs,
and a gasket/seal kit for the top end of the motor.

Thanks for any advice,
Clark
