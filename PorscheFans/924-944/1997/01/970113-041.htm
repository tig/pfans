"Re 951 power cutout"

My 951 was doing the same thing.  I blew the head gasket before we solved the
problem.  It started as a slight stumble when pulling 3rd gear and progressively
became worse.  It acted like the rev limiter was cutting in.  It would start
when pulling the high end of third gear.  Total momentary power failure.  After
starting, it would reappear when pressing on the gas in third or forth at almost
any rpm.

Checked the relays, disassembled the relay/fuse box, ran a remote fuel pressure
gauge, and checked as many things as possible on the dyno.  We concluded that it
may have been either a vacuum leak or the DME.  DMEs usually do not go bad.  

One thing to look at is the air adjustment screw on the throttle body.  My screw
fell out and produced a similar problem.  Angry Porsche god.
