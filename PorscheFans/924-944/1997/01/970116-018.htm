The most significant difference is in the (re)-design of the interior.  The
85 1/2s were the first 944s to have the rounded, oval-shaped dash layout,
with much improved steering wheel-to-seat clearance.  Some people have
debated as to which design is aethetically superior, but for tall folks
like myself, the choice was clear.  The automatic transmission is rare and
will naturally generate mixed opinions.  I think the very nature of the 944
neccessitates a manual transmission: it is one of the most finely-balanced,
best handling cars ever made--certainly one of the benchmark cars of the
1980s.  Obviously, performance with the automatic is not going to be as
strong as with the 5-speed, and I have never even seen an automatic on the
944 with the new dash design, so yours certainly seems to be alone in a
crowd.  You may want to trace the VIN to find out about the car's history
and see if the automatic was special ordered at the factory.
