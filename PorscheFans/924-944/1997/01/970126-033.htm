Hi Pholks,

I've been watching this thread for some time.  I have a beat-up 1970 
911E.  I have hit a Buick with it on a parking lot years ago and have only 
replaced the hood.  The car was an autox weapon with the interior stripped 
and a primered hood.  This car has rust spots and three colors of green 
paint on it.  Why is it a target for hit and runners?  I think that there 
are a bunch of people out of which the Porsche stands for some sort of 
class envy or something.  My guess is that it stands for success and 
those that target the car are your basic losers.  The only thing that my 
car could intimidate are the cars that have to run against me in my 
class.  I myself occupy a broom closet job with our local city government.
I don't feel that I am much of an intimidation sort.

The ownership of this car however brings out the a**hole in your basic loser.


I have had the top dented by a bottle thrown by a bunch of juveniles.  I 
have had the door kicked in.  I have had one of the horn grills broken.  
So what sort of person would get their jollies by beating up a 27 year old car?
