I asked the dealer about these extended changes years ago.. he stated some
government organization (can't remember which) told auto manufacturers to
put the extended intervals into the owner's manual to prevent dealers from
doing excessive and unneeded maintenance, to avoid overcharging the
consumer. 

Then, I read about 8 months ago, Consumer Reports magazine (a US based
consumer advocacy magazine) did a test on motor oils, and at the same
time, did a test on New York city taxicabs (GM cars with the standard V6). 
They tore down a new engine, measured bearing and other critical
clearances, assembled it, then ran it for 100K with extended change
intervals (I think 10k), then tore down the engine and measured it again. 
This was done on an identical engine, but with 3k change intervals, so a
comparison could be made. 

To summarize, CR basically discovered that shortening the oil change
interval made an insignificant advantage in reducing wear. 

My thoughts:  The test was limited, due to the single style of engine and
driving habits.  I am sure that different engines/driving habits would
change the results.  Personally, I do my changes every 3000 miles, in
defiance of Porsche's recommendations.  It is cheap to do, and I feel good
knowing I am getting all that suspended crud out of the engine.  Consumer
Reports made little mention of how accumulated acids and moisture can
cause internal corrosion, especially when a car is driven infrequently. 

I probably wouldn't cringe at an extended change while using synthetic
oil, due to its superior properties as compared to natural oil.  However,
the contaminants that accumulate will remain until the next change, but
again, synthetic oil has a superior additive package to counter the
effects of this accumulation. 

Gregor - 89 944 2.7L.  Oil changes every 3k, or sooner.
