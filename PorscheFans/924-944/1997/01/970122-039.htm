In that vein, I've recently replaced the front rotors on my 
car with new OEM rotors.  Before installing we cut two slots
on each side of the rotor face with a ball end mill (0.25 inch
radius, 0.037 inch deep).  This is the 'easy' method recommended
by Carol Smith in 'Engineer to Win'.  It's been raining so
much around here (Austin, TX) that I haven't had a chance to
really try out the brakes yet, but they look very nice 
cosmetically and I get 'trick' rotors for OEM cost.  I agree
with Kevin that cross drilling seems to be better suited to
race cars or to application where you can increase rotor size
to make up for the swept area.  Also, a good friend of mine 
just replaced all four of his BMW 325is's rotors with cross
drilled units and has complained about initial braking when
starting each morning's commute.
