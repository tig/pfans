	Steve,

	When you lift your foot off the gas, do you feel a lot
	of "slack" in the gears? This is hard to describe over
	Porschefans :) By slack I mean, you lift, then seem to
	coast for a second or so, then you jerkily decelerate.
	There should be a little but do you have a lot? This "slack"
	is a classic sign of a bad clutch. Does your car go into
	gear okay? Change gears okay? The clutch could be bad at
	40K but I'm thinking you have the classic 944 drive 
	train rattle. It's not bad and it can be alleviated
	to some degree by switching to Swepco transmission
	oil. It's really loud on my car even with Swepco.
