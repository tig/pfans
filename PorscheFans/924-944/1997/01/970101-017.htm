Folks,

I've a repair shop dilemma.  Early in December, I had 45K service done on
my 944 S2 (at 47K).  This included timing belt replacement.  I also  
asked the shop
to give the car a thorough going over, as this was the first  
service since
I purchased the vehicle at 42K mi.  The shop replaced all the other  
belts
as well.  As is the practice, they had me bring the car
back after 1000mi to retension the timing belt.  In between, the car
developed a squeal in the belt running the AC compressor.

After 1100 mi, I returned the car for the timing belt check, and to 
address the squeal.  Later that day, I received a call explaining that 
the squeal arose because AC compressor mounting bolts
had broken -- leaving the compressor free to move.  Broken bolts??  
Has anyone run into this?  Since the shop checked out the car, and
changed the belts, I would think they would have seen if the bolts
were loose.  The compressor itself wasn't producing unusual vibration,
and I avoid potholes and railroad tracks.  They've warned me that the 
AC mounting is difficult to get to -- may be labor-intensive.  This is
a very reputable shop, but this seems screwy.  What should I do?  Any 
advice/wisdom would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance
Todd K. Leen
90 S2
