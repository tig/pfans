Gary,

My Dad and I installed a Porsche CDC-1 changer in my 968 just last week.
We found a dealer in Westlake, California who is selling the changers for
just $500.  They're brand new and everything; apparently they made a deal
with Porsche and bought a lot of them.  The changer is mentioned in their
ad in the February 1997 Excellence - the name is Rusnak and their phone
number is (818)991-6340.  It works with the CR-1 with a cable that Rusnak
also sells.  The installation was quite simple.  Let me know if you have
any other questions, and good luck!
