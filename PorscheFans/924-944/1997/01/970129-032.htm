Have you checked your motor mounts?  As you apply the clutch, the engine
tends to torque against its mounts, leaning especially hard on the
passenger-side mount.  If you've got original mounts, the rubber in them is
now going on eleven years old-- time to be replaced.  By reving the engine
so high, you're probably completely compressing the mount, keeping it from
rebounding and acting like a spring.  Check it out and see what you can.
