Wolfgang et al,

Here in the USA we have 5W30, 10W30, and 15W50.  Originally Mobil 1 only
came in the 15W50 grade, but later expanded to include the other two.
Most new cars have a recommendation for 5W30 as "energy conserving."
Other typical American cars generally use 10W30.  Those cars marketed as
"high performance" would spec the 15W50, which is what I put in my son's
944 turbo.
