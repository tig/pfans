My 1987 944S was totaled in an accident (not my fault) 
during the summer of 1995.  Amazingly enough, I am still 
fighting with my insurance company regarding its value.  I 
have been compensated, however in casual conversation with 
my State Farm agent last week he decided to reopen the case 
and try to get me some more money.

State Farm thinks they are being generous giving me $11,700 
plus tax (keep in mind the accident took place in July of 
'95).  From my observations and searching for a replacement 
car, the value could go as high as $15,000 for the car, but 
I have seen like cars for around $12,500.  Obviously, there 
are other 944S's out there in lesser condition worth 
significantly less.

The details of my car are/were as follows:

*all original equipment and most options
*32,000 miles
*mint condition (could have been driven into any showroom)
*always factory serviced
*never raced/abused/neglected in any way

What I'm looking for is some 'proof' regarding the value of 
my car at the time of the accident.  Or, if anyone has any 
more recent examples of 944 series cars being sold for a 
premium because of exceptional condition, I would very much 
appreciate hearing about it.  Perhaps has anyone seen adds, 
bought low mileage 944's, etc.?

Any help will be appreciated.  I know there are examples of 
944's going for less, but that won't help my case.
