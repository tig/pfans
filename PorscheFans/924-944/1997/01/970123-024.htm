I have had the same "problem" with my 1988 924S... It has been quite cold
over here in Holland a few weeks back and changing gears has been hard: 1st
to 2nd (and back) and sometimes to 3rd... I had the same problems with the
1983 924 I had prior to this one.

I don't think it's really a problem or that you need a gearbox-rebuild...
Especially since it's really OK when it's warmer. You should always be a
little more carefull when the gearbox is cold, for the same reason that you
shouldn't rev your engine up to 7000 when it's cold... The oil doesn't do
it's job as good when it's cold.

I found two things two things to help a little: when you start your car (in
really cold weather), let it run for a while (few secs) in Neutral with the
clutch up (so that the stuff in the gearbox turns round). That way the oil
gets mixed up and starts doing it's job before real force it put into the
box.

When changing gears, first place the stick in the center, then proceed
(slowly) into 2nd. If you feel resistance, don't push it, simply place it
back in the center and try again (maybe let the clutch-pedal up a little in
neutral).

Also shifting into Reverse can be difficult when it's cold. Don't push,
place in neutral, let the clutch pedal up and try again...

Hope this helps !
