Here are some tips :

Make sure the miles on the odometer are the actual miles.  This has more to do
with making sure the price is fair than anything else.  Make sure all electrics
are working, unless you want to spend your time chasing down small electrical
problems.  If there are more than a couple problems with the electrical system,
or if gauges or items are behaving a little odd, stay way from it.  My previous
944 had many electrical problems.  After chasing down a few, and finding out
the PO had rewired or messed with the wiring, I realized I should have bought
another car...

Usually if the interior is well taken car of, the rest of the car may be too.
 Have the car checked out by a porsche mechanic, unless you feel you know cars
well enough.

Look for leaks.  You might want to raise the car and fish around underneath to
look for leaks  (coolant, oil, etc...)  If it is leaking around the front of
the engine, it is probably in need of front oil seals, or new water pump
(depending on fluid leaking).

If you buy the car, I suggest you have the balance shaft and timing belts
replaced (unless you know that they were serviced recently).  If these are in
poor condition, then you are risking an engine.  I just bought these, the
timing belt is about $18, and the balance shaft belt is about $30 (from
dealer).

If your looking for a fast car, the n/a 944 is not that fast.  It has ~160 hp,
and a lot of the newer sedans can give it a run for its money.  It does handle
nicely, and is a very fun car to drive.

have fun!
