Jeffrey,


To really nail this down, one would want to do a complete checkout of
your exhaust system, consider removing the turbocharger and re-gasket it,
and evaluate the waste gate.   Putting it on a dyno could help, too, because 
you could evaluate the exhaust gases at the same time.   One reason for
the loss of boost can be lack of fuel - leaning - which would be picked up
by the sniffer.  If fuel were the problem, it could be related to failing fuel
pressure regulators on the fuel rail, or a vacuum leak which would compromise
the effectiveness of the fuel enrichment system.

 The frustrating part of this sort of thing is that it is still
intermittant, and probably did not show itself to the shop you took it to.

Good luck.

Dave
