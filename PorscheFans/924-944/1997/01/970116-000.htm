Antony

One thing I didn't mention is that the Aussie-spec cars have a threaded bolt
hole in the floor of the rear hatch to allow a baby seat belt fitting to be
attached (the insert with the owner's manual says that you have to make a
short slit in the boot carpet to access it).  I doubt it is present on UK or
US spec cars - but worth looking for anyway...?

I would be surprised if it is impossible to fit a 3 point belt to any 944.
At worst, it would surely just involve a fitting for the shoulder strap to
be welded to the top of the rear wheelarch?

David.

PS - Yep, pretty warm here at the moment!  Tend to leave the 944 in the
garage during the day - don't think the German interior is really up to
Aussie UV levels!
