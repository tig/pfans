Thanks to everyone for responding to my "hiccup" question. I will go
through all suggestions and report any success. More advice is welcome.

Reading somebody else's post about a clunk in the rear I am reminded of a
problem with my 84 944 that I had almsot forgotten about. For the past
year there has been a steady clunking in the right rear. It sounds exactly
like something moving about in the rear compartments, something heavy.
After emptying everything out, including the spare and the jack, the noise
continued. I took the axle apart and the CVs show some wear but nothing
alarming. Packed them, reversed them (axle to diff.) and put them back.
The clunk continued. About six months ago the clunk started in the left
rear wheelwell area. The left clunk sounds sharper, closer to a clik, but
that could just be because it is closer to my ears.

Meanwhile the right-rear clunk continues. It does not increase in
frequency or volume with speed or rpms (unlike CV wear). It has gotten a
little louder over the past year, but again nothing very alrming. I have
tried endlessly to figure this problem out and have given up. There is
negligible play in my wheels, although I will eventually get around to
checking the wheel bearings. Wheel bearing wear is accompanied -- in my
experience -- with a whine that increases with speed though.

While my 944 is not exactly your noiseless Lexus, the clunking in the
rear is extremely annoying, albeit harmless. What I am more worried
about is that I am ignoring some important symptoms? Any insight would be
appreciated.
