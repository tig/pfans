>Hi, I'm a new member to the list, and do not own a Porsche as of yet.  I am
>contemplating the purchase of a ~'82 944.  The asking price is $3995, and
>the car has almost exactly 99K miles.  I have test driven the car and would
>like to get some feedback before I plunk down the cash.
>
>First off, let me give you a little background.  I am mechanically
>inclined, and have owned two '80's Datsun 280ZX's and a Toyota which I have
>maintained myself, performing everything from oil changes, water pump and
>alternator changes, to strut and ball joint replacement, and am about to
>replace the timing belt on the Toyota.  I even rebuilt my own L-Jetronic
>air flow sensor!  Do you think I can maintain the 944 myself? Does it

>Toyota parts?

You clearly possess all the talents required to do the job.   It ain't rocket
science.

>My questions are:
>
>1) Is the car worth ~$3500 I'm going to offer for it?

Not for an 82.   They did not start production until 83.

>
>2) Can I fix this thing myself for a reasonable price?

Depends.   Keep the oil fresh.   Parts are not free, but no worse than
many Japanese cars.   A fifteen year old Porsche will require some care.

>
>3) Can I spend more time driving it than fixing it?

Generally not.   These are NOT early British sports cars.

>
>4) Are the problems I have noticed normal for this car at this age and
>mileage?

The shifter looseness is typical and fixable, cheap.   The rough idle should
not be tolerated and could mean a motor mount failure, frequent in 944s.
Medium
expensive to replace.   I don't buy cars with unidentified whines.

>
>5) What other pit-falls are there I should watch out for?

If they cannot give you a service receipt showing the date the timing belt was
changed, or the date is nearing 30,000 miles with all the required inspections,
AND you still buy the car, TOW it home and change the belt with the required
$500 tensioning tool. 

Listen for deep engine knocks at idle.   If you hear it, walk away with all
your money.  

944s, properly cared for and represented, are WONDERFUL cars to drive.   A lot
of them end up on used car lots with questionable histories for all the wrong 
reasons.   A 944 this old should be considered a parts car until the seller can 
prove otherwise.

Hope this helps.
