Ok Eric, people on the list are going to enjoy hearing me say this because
I was exactly like you when I bought my car and people emailed me some
pretty nasty stuff, but for good reason as I've now found out.  Some
background first, my previous car, a 1992 Talon AWD was heavily modified
and I also had tinkeritis where I couldn't leave it alone, to the tune
of C$900/month on maintenance to keep the thing running!  Anyhow, I bought
a 944 Turbo S which already had chips in it.  I immediately wanted to add
turbos, wings, strut braces, big haired women, whatever it took, I wanted
to add it . . .  but, after owning the car for 5-6 months, I've come
to appreciate the incredible performance the car has with just chips.

The MAS does not give much power, it DOES reduce lag, but then the car
becomes boring to drive.  I went for a ride in a MAS, K27 car with all
equipment from Powerhaus.  For what the car gave up before 5000rpm,
I don't feel it's worth it to go that route for a street driven car.  On
a track car (which this was BTW), having an extra 50hp above 5000rpm can
mean the difference between 1st and 10th place, but on the street
giving up 100hp below that allows deisel trucks to blow your doors off 
across the intersection.

This is what I would do, if it were my car:

1. Make sure everything is in good working order.  Change the fuel filter,
   air filter (K&N or stock paper are both good, the paper one filters
   better, but the K&N gives a seat of the pants smoothness increase)
2. Get the Stage II Autothority chips.
3. Join PCA and start doing track days and autocrossing.
4. If you still need more power, I would get a wide fire ring head gasket,
   K26-8 turbo (same as Turbo S or Turbo Cup turbo) and the new chipset.
   Autothority will give you a $200 refund on your old chips in exchange.

The Turbo Cup or Turbo S turbochargers have a larger exhaust housing (8cm
VS. 6cm) which reduces back pressure, but increases lag.  The gains will
be above 4000rpm, but man does the thing move at those revs!

Get a newer technology tire like the Dunlop SP8000 which are reasonable
priced, wear well and are very good in dry and wet.  I've even autocrossed
on mine with no appreciable wear or degredation.

Knowledgeable racers say NO.  I tend to believe them considering they've
been doing this for a while.  They made a difference on my last car, but
this car really feels like a tank, so I personally also doubt it would
do anything.  It does look cool though.  If I find a carbon fibre one,
I might stick it on.

Have you looked at the exhaust system?  It's an excellent system.  The
cat-con bypass will help throttle response, but don't expect more than
5hp at the wheels gain.  Here's the reason why.  The factory exhaust seems
to be a 2.5" diameter which is a perfect size for 300hp applications.
The exhaust goes into the header and down into the external wastegate.
If the boost has not hit 1bar, the wastegate stays closed and send the
gases to the turbocharger exhaust housing.  The exhaust spins up the turbo
and leaves by going through the cat-con and into the straight through muffler.
If the boost is at 1bar, the wastegate starts to open to vent the gases.
This is where the engineering of Porsche shines, they piped the excess gases
PAST the cat-con and then it goes into the muffler, so at WOT for long
periods of time, there is only enough exhaust gases going through the
turbo to maintain 1bar boost, the rest is bypassing the cat.

A loud car gets droning after a while anyways.  If sound is really what
you're after, get the cat-con bypass, you'll get this really nice 
Honda Civic open exhaust noise when you life off the throttle and the
wastegate shuts (sounds kind of like a dump truck!).  I'm being sarcastic
here, just in case you didn't catch it.

After going for a ride in that K27 race car, I'm not too thrilled with
the MAF.  I'm sure that above 300hp, it would give you a gain, but how
much?  20hp?  I'd much rather put that money into a set of 17" wheels
and tires, it would be a much better investment.  Panorama had a used MAF
for sale for US$800 a while back for your car, that would be the better
way of trying it than to dish out US$1795 for one.

>Turbo Upgrades/Revisions:

Get the Turbo S turbo if you want bottom end or talk to Powerhaus if you
want a killer track car.  K27 comes in WAY up there.

The rear seats don't seem to weigh much.  I would think the front ones
are beasts of weight.  I have the sport seats with height adjustment and
heaters.  My guess would be that they weigh at least 100lbs each.  Any
idea guys?

>Short Shift Kits:       ?

The gearbox is designed for smooth, intentional shifts, not slam,
drag race shifts so why bother?  I've yet to miss a shift and I actually
shift quite hard.  I also match revs downshift and sometimes match revs
upshift (in cold weather before the box heats up).  Never had a problem
and don't anticipate one.

>Any Secrets of Speed that I have missed?

I don't know how you drive, so I can't answer that.  A good alignment
with decent tires, a chip and some driver training and you'll be 
unstoppable.

>responding, I will be eternally grateful!

No problem.  I wanted to do the same thing and I got back some pretty
hot answers to my questions.  Hopefully, I haven't been too mean, but
really, think about what you're doing to the car and for what purpose
before dumping tons of cash.  Trust me, my last year of racing my last
car could've paid for my Porsche :(  If only, I had really sat down
and thought things out.  Oh well, live and learn.
