Try the auxiliary air valve, which is tasked with controlling idle speed.
It should have battery voltage to it while the engine is running.  If it
does, replace it.  If it does not, check the source.  You describe a common
failure mode.

It would depend on how low, I guess.  All engines will show lower pressure
once warmed up and the oil has thinned out.   The most important measure is
what it does when pulling high rpms.  If it is ok there, then it is ok.

  Speaking

Is your fan working?  Is the coolant level OK?  Is there enough coolant?

That is the best way, for a whole lot of reasons.

  I bought the "poorman's" Porsche for a reason, I'm not rich
