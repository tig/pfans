     Tom,
     What I did on my '89 951 was replace the stock head unit with a 
     Blaupunkt New Orleans CD125 unit. This unit does not allow use of the 
     stock EQ, but that really not matter to me. The sound is great, and it 
     looks like it was meant for the car. You are welcome to take a look at 
     it and hear how it sounds.

Hi all,
     
My son wants to upgrade the standard Blaupunkt Stereo in his '89 Turbo.
     
Does the built-in equalizer provide additional or primary amplification, 
and if so, how much power does it have?  We are leaning to just replacing 
the head unit with a Sony CDX-C510 CD player and bypassing the equalizer. 
The Sony is a 35x4 watt (peak) unit.  Will this be sufficient to drive the 
stock 10 speaker system, or would a separate amp be required.  Although my 
son plans to add a separate amp later when he upgrades the speakers, he'd 
like to start with just a CD player for now.
     
Any opinions on good CD players, amps, etc would be appreciated.
     
TIA,
     
Tom
Redmond, WA
