I owned a used '89 944 for a couple of years, and still would if I
hadn't sold it to my brother and moved to Australia for awhile. I'd
certainly buy it again, and might if he ever wants to sell it.It was a
good reliable car, so long as you follow careful maintenance, being
especially vigilant with the timing belt and water pump. I don't know
the 924, but do not read many good things about it. I've seen '87s
advertised here in Boulder, CO for a lot less than you are being asked
(around $4,500-$5,00). Check out the archives on www.PorscheFans.com.
