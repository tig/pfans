Sorry, I just could NOT resist.

David, I think you have a clogged fuel filter.  I have seen this exact
symptom several times.  Beneath the symptom, the pump is able to push only
enough fuel through the filter to activate the injectors for a certain
amount of time, then it is like you run out of fuel.  The engine literally
quits until you have time to build up pressure again, or until you take some
of the load off.  You MIGHT be able to see this with a fuel pressure gauge,
but would need to have the engine under load so that it asks for enough
power/fuel to cause the problem.  If you want to toss parts at it, replace
the filter and see what happens.

Dave
