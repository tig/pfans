Aloha!
Recently we've been hearing alot about hit and runners on our
listserve, and how it seems like they're out to get our cars.
I own two porsche's , one 1977 924 and a 1983 944, the 924 is in
storage in Colorado, but when I was driving it to school I always
parked in B.F.E. so that it wouldn't be dinged, and the only day of
the year I parked it in the parking lot I got hit in the right rear
fender causing over five hundred dollars worth of damage to my
car!  My new 944 is here in Hawaii and just last week I was at a
party and a guy walked by my car and for no reason at all went
to kick it in the door, he saw me in the drivers seat and decided it
might be a good idea not to.  
I tell you some people are so sad that they need to harm someone
elses things just because they think they can't have them!
Jealous Bastards!
