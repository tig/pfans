Hi all.  My wife just bought a 87 944S, and she wants to put new tires
and rims on it. I'm saying Yoko's 225/60's with A/R rims. She's got
Pirelli's on it now with the factory rims, but she doesn't like the
rough ride and road noise from the P600's. Also the rims are in moderate
shape with some of the chrome coming off. She wants Bridgestone tires
215/60's.
She drives mostly 60 miles daily on the highways. She's also in the
market for Porsche rims. What is the cost for new or used Porsche rims?
 
	But before we buy, I would like to know if there's a catalouge we can
get from Porsche or somewhere else for accessories and parts, mail order
or local (south-eastern Va.).
