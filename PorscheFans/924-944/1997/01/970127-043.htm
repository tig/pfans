	Clark,

	Good news. I don't think any of that's the problem. I think
	you got an air bubble in your system when you replaced the
	hose and you just didn't get it out. Did you bleed the system
	using the bleed screw? With the heater turned on? Your owner's
	maunal covers this in detail. Go back and re-bleed it (maybe even
	a couple of times) and I bet that'll fix your problem.
