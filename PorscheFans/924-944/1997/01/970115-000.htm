"I have an 85 944 and wish to fit a rear 3 point seat belt in order to use
the Porsche baby seat. The United Kingdom 3 point inertia  belt only fits
87 or later cars and Porsche UK only have a lap belt for 85 cars which is
no good for the baby seat.

"I have heard that in Australia Porsche made a fixed 3 point belt for 85
cars. Does anyone have any info please."


I have an Australian delivery 86 951 which was fitted with three point
retractable rear belts as standard (fitted at the factory to comply with
Australian law).  I haven't seen a fixed three point belt, but it is
definitely possible to fit retractable belts.  A friend privately imported
an '86 944 from the UK and he had to have three point belts fitted - I don't
believe this was done by Porsche.  Australia has a small industry in
converting imported cars to Aussie design rules, so I guess it wasn't too
hard to arrange locally!
