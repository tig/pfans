Hi Guys,

Here's a short progress report on my clutch repair project.
If you're not interested, delete it now.

On Satuday, 4 friends arrived to help me replace the clutch in
my 89 951. Three of them are PorscheFriend members (Hi Henry,
John and Bill). 

Currently, everything has been removed from the car, and next weekend
I hope to put it all back together. As I suspected, the problem with
the clutch was that one of the small damping springs had broken and
was floating around the clutch assembly. Another one of the springs
was also broken, but was still attached to the clutch disc. I a little
depressed because my new clutch kit includes the same kind of clutch 
disc. I wonder how long it will last?

Here are some random notes about the job:

The best source of information on this job is the Mike Kehr Clutch
FAQ. The Factory manual, IMHO, is not very informative. The Haynes
manual is really written for the older cars, and my 89 951 had some
considerable differences.

The Clutch FAQ said to remove the exhaust pipe that goes under the
motor from the exhaust manifold to the turbocharger. I didn't have
to remove that. Good thing too, because it would have been a real PITA.

All the sources said to remove the speed sensors on the top of the
bellhousing. None said to also remove the speed sensor mounting
block. Thanks to Marv De Beque <debequem@rcinet.com>, I knew (after
much struggling before I knew) to remove the block. This is not fun,
and as I was warned, you really need to remove some heater hoses that
are in the way.

As mentioned by some other people (I forget who), the easiest way to
remove the transaxle is to remove the crossmember that the transaxle is
mounted to. We didn't do that, instead we struggled to push the long
bolts at the top of the transaxle back through the case. Later, when
we had to move the torque tube back another 1/2" or so, we removed
the crossmember. If we had done that earlier, it would have made every-
thing a little easier.

Anyone who attempts to do this job without an air compressor and air
tools is a masochist. There is VERY little room to move a ratchet 
when removing hardware. I used a big ratchet to loosen bolts, and
then an air ratchet to remove them (usually connected to some very
long, very strange attachments of flex sockets, universal joints,
and wobble extensions. 

The best tool known to man (no, it's not a hammer) is a long (18") 1/2"
drive flex head ratchet. With the length, breaking stuck bolts was a 
snap (perhaps, snap is the wrong word to use). The blex head means you
can turn bolts a little further than a straight ratchet allows.

Unfortunately, all the written hints make a lot more sense after you've
done this once before. 

Pulling the pilot bearing was a pain. Then John Potter invented the
"Potter Patented Pilot bearing Puller." This made pulling the bearing
a piece of cake. If anyone wants one, we will sell them for the amazingly
low price of $49.99, that's right, $49.99. But wait, you also get ...
Sorry, I went a little crazy there, The puller is a claw hammer, 
a long bolt with a head a little smaller than the pilot bearing, and
a nut. I tried the Haynes technique of Vice Grips, but that didn't
work. By levering the hammer on the bottom the motor case, the bearing
came right out.

I'm also cleaning and repacking my CV joints. From the CV Joint FAQ
and the Haynes book, I expected to find washers between the axle and
the CV Joint. My axles had no washers. Has anyone else seen that,
or am I missing the washers? Perhaps Porsche just ran out when my
car was assembled, so they put the axles together without them (I 
don't think so)? Or, is the 951 axle a little different?

If your transaxle has an oil cooler, you'll never have an easier chance
to change your fuel filter than now, so do it.

So right now, the car is in pieces in the garage. I hope to put it back
together next weekend. I did strip the head on one of the 8mm 12 point 
bolts that holds the clutch onto the flywheel. Otherwise, nothing broke, 
and no one got  bloody. Now if I can only figure out how to put things 
back together!
