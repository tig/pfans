Hi Farzaan,

<<I'm curious as to what you noticed the most.  Was it the power
difference or was it just that you were going much faster into the
corners.  Did you find yourself getting scared at all?  Were your lap
times significantly faster in the Turbo than the NA?>>

The power difference was the most obvious difference. And yes, it was
much scarier. But that's what learning to drive fast is all about. I had
become used to the speeds of the NA 944 so I could practically go to
sleep and still turn decent lap times. This car still scares the
bejeezus out of me after 2 days of track time. My previous best in the
NA 944 was a 2:03 on very used Yokohama A008RSIIs. I was down to 1:57 by
the end of the third session the first day on new unshaved BFG R1s with
a 'passenger' (Barry Lenoble of this list) in the passenger seat giving
me some expert instruction. I didn't get any more times the rerst of the
weekend, but I probably chopped another 2 or 2 seconds off the 1:57. I
simply couldn't believe how well the car turned in compared to my '84. I
think half of it was due to the R1s and the other half due to a much
better balance. Hopefully, I can get comfortable with the power before
Bridgehampton *really* closes. 

I wrote a rather long description of the event that I'll send you via
private email. No sense boring everybody with it. ;-)

<<I'm no expert on the R1's, but aren't the pressures supposed to be
higher? There is a document on the web somewhere called "The car and
feeding of BFG R1's" in which they mention a higher pressure to be run,
unless it's the old 226 compound R1's.  In autocross, when I ran R1's, I
ran 32/32 which worked quite well.  But, if you didn't have any unusual
wear, your settings are likely fine.  I think they recommend the higher
pressures to help cure the EGOD.>>

Is that cold or hot? I asked a local 944 Turbo guru/instructor, Nial
Malloy, who was on R1s what pressures he was using. His were set at 25
cold all around. I wanted to go a bit higher just in case I did
something stupid. 32 cold seems a bit high, but I'll certainly take a
look at their web site. BTW, no sign of the evil EGOD!

<<Don't disconnect it.  The really hard core "old-school" guys will tell
you that modulation by your foot is the best method, blah, blah, blah.>>

Better watch what you say! I happen to be one of those 'old-school'
guys. ;-)

<<Once you are used to the ABS system, you will find that Porsche's ABS
system is much, much better than most any other car's system.>>

I'm sure it is better than the average bear, but I'm still the one with
the opposable thumbs. :-)

Seriously, ABS is one of the most significant safety innovations of the
20th Century. It ranks right up there with the 3-pt belt system and
airbags, neither of which have much use at the track if you have a
harness and a roll bar or cage. I wouldn't think of disabling the ABS on
the street or probably at the track under wet conditions. But on the
track in dry conditions I really don't want or need some computer
messing with my brakes. Besides, being a realtime programmer with 24
years experience, I really don't trust someone else's code. There is
*always* one more bug! 

Thanks for the advice!

Paul Foster
