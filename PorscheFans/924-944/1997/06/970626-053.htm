<<Were you ever military, or are you a student of military history?  The
application of force should be in direct proportion to the offense.  You
do not kill a puppy for messing the rug, and you don't slap a boy who
has just murdered his girlfriend.  Force is not a bad thing, just a
tool. Arie was never in danger, and he wasn't injured.>>

I just couldn't let this one go by without highlighting it. Wow, I'm
glad I'm not your kid. I'm scarred enough from the verbal abuse I took
from my father the Army Major... (Not that I agree with the baiting
Naweed gave you, either.)

Here's *my* AJ story. It was Laguna Seca in '88 or '89, I believe. I
think it was the first Porsche Indycar race (obligatory PCar content
thank you very much!) I had just purchased a Minolta SLR for my
girlfriend - one with a motor drive. I was going through the paddock
playing at being a race photographer. Motor drives weren't that common
yet so everybody (such as Danny Sullivan) turned to see who was filming
what whenever I took a shot. Rick Mears' car had just won pole and I was
standing at the tech inspection when they brought the car in. I have
always been interested in formula car construction and I was trying to
get a picture of the underside of the car while it was on the raised
platform (something you never get to see unless they are
rubber-side-up). 

Someone took my photographic interest as an attempt to steal the car's
setup and to sell it to backmarkers, such as AJ at that stage of his
career. I knew nothing of this except that a very large individual
decided to stand directly in front of me and glare. I asked him to move.
He wouldn't and he kept glaring as he positioned himself between me and
the car as I tried to get another clear shot. I quickly lost interest
and continued to stroll through the paddock. But I had a feeling that
people were talking about me and pointing at me behind my back while I
was blithely taking photos of this, that, and the other thing. 

I got to AJ's trailer about 5 minutes later and called to him hoping to
get a good photo. He flexed his shoulders and gave me a look that would
have killed or at least blinded most. I got my photo and got the hell
out. (I still have it along with the one I managed to get of Rick's
car.) It wasn't until later when I put two and two together and realized
how close I had come to receiving some of AJ's swift justice. I wonder
how much corrective force he thought I deserved at that point in time.

By the way, all CART competitors now cover their wings to keep their
setup from being 'stolen' - as though you could tell much just from the
wing angles without knowing the spring rates, ride height, shock
settings, etc. Coincidence, or what? <g>

I guess the moral of the story is that being in the wrong place at the
wrong time is all it takes when quick tempers are involved. There is no
such thing as swift justice. It is an oxymoron.
