it could also be a function of the radio sensitivity... the Alpine in my
car seems to outperfrom any other radio I've experienced here in Atlanta...
I get a low power southside rap station and a host of leftside FM stations
on the northside, that most cars I've been in can't pick up even when
downtown... I have the cruddy window antenna...

Standard Alpine Warning: great CD head unit with 2 preamp connectors, but
bright as shit at night... I have to cover it up at night sometimes to
preserve the cool muted orange of the dashboard...  sometimes I think about
getting rid of it just for this reason alone, except it works too well
otherwise...
