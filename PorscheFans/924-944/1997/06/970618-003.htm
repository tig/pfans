TRAITOR!!!!   ;-)  (see Sig!)

I had my '84 911 for 3 years ( and 2 914's for a total of 9 years) before I
bought my wife a '90 S2.  I find myself making all sorts of excuses
(maintenance, stange noises I heard when she pulled into the driveway, etc.)
to get out in the car.  Especially when she won't be in it!  ;-)

I could be completely satisfied with this car if it weren't for the lack of
aftermarket goodies available.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  My
911 has more stuff to be acquired than almost any other car around--the
wallet is definitely the limiting factor, not the selection.  Everything
costs more for the S2.  This is why I didn't buy a 930!

She actually let me AX her car at the Carolina's Region Porschefest.  (Met
great people, had a great time!)  I finished ahead of two 951's and was
bested by another 951 track car--no interior, roll cage, slicks, and God
knows what other enhancements.  Check out the club newsletter online,
"Tobacco Roads", for the actual times.  I felt pretty good considering it
was my first time out in her car.  Great Machine!!  What else would you
expect from Porsche?

Enjoy!
