Farzaan, Fans, et al.

Yep, these tapes are fantastic!  Totally over the top.  I saw a bunch when
I lived in Hong Kong, but never brought any of them back.  I don't have a
multi-system VCR, but as long as the finished product is in NTSC-format,
yeah, I'd definitely want a copy.

For those on the list who have never seen these videos, naturally, they're
in Japanese, but the photography and camera angles are phenomenal.  I saw
one section where an NSX and a Ferrari 348 (this was a few years ago) went
up against each other for a 1/4 mi run.  At the green light, the cars took
off.  There was a camera mounted inside each car, and the screen was split
down the middle so you could see at what points the cars shifted, and which
one looked like it had the better ergonomics, etc.  Really trick stuff.
Highly recommended.

Of course, I also remember the rather sexist sections which featured a
segment on "how good do women look in the car?"  Farzaan, can you edit that
part out?  Oh heck, just leave it in.

Subject: No charging of battery in 951!
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     Someone please help!  My '86 951 has been in the shop for 2 days 
     straight now, and labor fees are mounting.  A week ago, I noticed that 
     my accessories were not activating on demand, and that my battery was 
     reaching extrememly low charge levels.  I immediately suspected my 
     alternator, but after taking it to my mechanics, they quickly (thank 
     God) discovered that the voltmeter (potentiometer?) bulb in the 
     instrument cluster was not lighting when I started the car (actually 
     it lights before key is in start position, but you can see it when you 
     stall too).  Apparently, this silly $1 bulb serves as a resistor in 
     the alternator's circuit and indicates that the field within the 
     alternator is being excited before you start the car (or something 
     like that--it seemed weird to me but I've had this fact confirmed by 
     several individuals).  In any case, I was relieved that I wouldn't 
     have to replace my alternator.
        But after 2 hours of labor to get in and out of my dash, my 
     mechanic has discovered that the bulb is intact (this procedure was 
     still necessary since the bulb would not light when trying to pass 
     juice through it directly from a loop under the hood).  Now I am told 
     that my factory alarm's wiring (which was unplugged a few months ago 
     due to false alarms that I didn't want to diagnose) is probably the 
     cause.
        Has anyone heard of this alarm/charging problem before?  My 
     mechanic says that it's pretty common, but more prevalent among 911's. 
      Any ideas?  All suggestions and donations are welcome.
     
     Thanks,
     ben
