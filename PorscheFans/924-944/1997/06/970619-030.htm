Hmm.. Yes, I definitely think so. :) When the switch is in the uppermost
position, i.e.  headlights down and no parking light, the bumper lights are
supposed to come on. You can't turn these off any other way than switching
to parking lights. You do have a European model, yes?

Hmm.. Well. There are actually 944s with three sets of lights. From top to
bottom they are something like this:

   Flippable (? :) headlights

   Driving lights in bumper

   Fog or driving lights in front spoiler/valance


The driving lights are supposed to come on immediately when you turn the
key. That is, if the switch is in the uppermost position. I guess you know
how the headlights work.. :)

As for the fog lights, I think they are actually driving lights. A 944 guy I
talked to had these on his '83, and they were lit at the same time as the
driving lights in the bumper. They were just as bright as far as I recall,
so I think they are driving lights.
