Maybe you didn't or havent the time to read some old post, but one of
the members was " jacked" by a Garage. He voiced his situation and
that's one place to voice it. You might have had a good experience with
Ron and Eurospeed, but Steve haven't. This forum is used for good and
bad situations and you accept his point of view or not accordingly to
you experience. Maybe another member has a different perspective and he
might use the list to voice it. Is not unfair, improper or againts any
kind of morals to voice his displeasure with the service provided by
eurospeed. Like it or not no one is here to censure his/her opinions and
we more than appreciate his sharing of his experience... Unfortunatly,
Kyle one bad experience, results in a loss of 30 or 40 potential clients
and thats probably something that you foresee for eurospeed... Sad but
true. Ron will need to have possibly to make some good new svc to some
folks to change some opinions...

Sorry if I don't share your point of view, but I was brought under
freedon of opinion and able to voice anytime I have to ... "Libert=E9,
Egalit=E9 et Fraternit=E9 " are followed to the letter
