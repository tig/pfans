Hey Fans,

Let me tell you about my recent experience with tire balancing. I bought two
sets of tires for two of my cars this year ('83 NA and '82 VW Cab - entirely
different tires, similar suspension). On both cars I had the tires mounted and
balanced and then took a drive. On both cars I immediately experienced awful
shimmy (worse than the old tires) at 60-65mph which decreased w/ speed. Both
times I went back for a rebalance and both times they radically changed the
weighting, sometimes removing all the weights. Guess what, smooth as you know
what at all speeds, including the dreaded 60-65mph. What happens, according to
one shop, is that the tires settle onto the rims after a few miles and the
balance goes to hell. So, the moral of the story: After tire mounting take a
drive, then go back for the balance job.

Hope this helps,
Adam Koller
