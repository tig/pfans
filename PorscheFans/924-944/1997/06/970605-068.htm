Thanks to everyone on the list who responded to my cries for help 
about the cracked bearing cap in my 931.  Turns out (like most of you 
said) I would have to strip the block again if I found a replacement 
to have it line-bored.  Fortunately, The cap was not cracked through 
the bearing shell itself, but behind it, between the shell and the 
rear main seal.  I was able to have it welded by someone with lots of 
experience.  He built a simple jig to bolt it down and bored these 
neat little "vees" in the metal, so he could tig weld it.  That, plus 
the cost of machining, was $45.  Not bad.  I haven't measured the 
clearances yet, but I'm pretty sure it will fit just right.

Thanks again-

Dave 8^)
