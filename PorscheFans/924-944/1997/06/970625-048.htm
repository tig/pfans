	I met AJ a long time ago, I was 4 or 5.  I was at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway motel diner with my parents, and they pointed out AJ and Mario
Andretti having lunch.  My parents  kind of pushed me along so I went to
get Mario and AJ's autographs.  Mario was nice, polite, very kind.  AJ just
glared at me but gave me his autograph anyway.  I will be the first to say
that AJ isn't very nice, but he isn't a coward.  AJ is just a rough old
good-old boy who has made a living driving all his life, came up though the
ranks from sprint cars, drove GT40s and everything else you can imagine,
paid his dues and became one of the winningest drivers ever.  I think he
holds the title of winningest Indy Car driver of all time.  General Patton
had a big mouth, MacArthur had a big mouth, maybe you do, I certainly have
said and done things I regret.  I don't care who is foreign, domestic, fat
or thin, both of these guys (Arie and AJ) are great drivers, but Arie was a
damn poor sport not to handle this through an official protest.  You do not
just go into the winner's circle and start whining!  He deserved a good
smack;  Sometimes a bonk on the head is needed to get someone's attention.
	Were you ever military, or are you a student of military history?  The
application of force should be in direct proportion to the offense.  You do
not kill a puppy for messing the rug, and you don't slap a boy who has just
murdered his girlfriend.  Force is not a bad thing, just a tool. Arie was
never in danger, and he wasn't injured.
