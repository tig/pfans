The reason that the Lexus is not as good as your humble 924 is because
it is sold in its home market (Japan) as a Toyota. Shock horror! A
Toyota you say. Lexus= Luxury EXport US. Obviously it will sell better
than to call it a Toyota Crown Mk II. A Toyota will never by better than
a Porsche . Lexus = mutton dressed up as lamb.

P-fans,

I made a fairly interesting discovery yesterday that I thought you all
would
find interesting.  A friend of mine bought a Lexus ES300 a few months
ago
and while riding in it yesterday I noticed that this new, $35k, Lexus
lacked
the solidness of my tired, 15 year old 924.

Once I started paying attention, I noticed that the doors did not shut
with
the solid authority of the Porsche (although, compared to others in it's
class, it is very good).  The car felt almost "tinny".  It's hard to put
it
into words but it was like the plushness of the Lexus was all
superficial,
there was no substanance underneath.

This discovery just further convinced me that the Porsche is truely a
solid
work of art made to last.  While not without it's shortcommings, it is a
car
to be loved.
