You really used Gunk?  We were just kidding!

Naw, I had my temperature gauge do the same thing after I Gunk-cleaned my
car.  Drove me to fits trying to figure out what was wrong.  Bought a new
sender and when the old one saw retirement looming on the horizon when I
brought the new one close to it, it straitened up all by itself and now
lives happily in its original place.

I also cleaned a wire harness connector located directly in front of the
fuse box (inside the engine bay).  That connector got some moisture in it.
Try that and some driving at highway speeds to dry out the car.  I really
do not think your oil pressure is faulty, just the sender has some juice
still in it.
