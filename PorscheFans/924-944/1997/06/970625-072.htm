While looking to purchase a 944 I came across an auto 944
It's an 82. It a hong-kong import with 46,000 miles only.
The car looks in great shape and the interior is great.
It's available at a significantly reduced price compared
to other manual 944's of the same year. (the price
won't mean much to US readers) It's about $4000-$6000 cheaper
than the other 944's I've been looking at.
The only thing is, how does the auto trans go?
I assume there is a significant reduction in performance
compared to the 5 speed. Is it something I couldn't live with?
(I'm going to test drive it later this week)
Also does anyone know how hong-kong treats it's cars?
We also get a lot of japanese imports here in Oz but even
though they're low milage they're terribly maintained,
(never get an oil change or service)

Thanks
