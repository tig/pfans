Back in March I asked my mechanic to address the very same problem.  The
inner lining of the OE tailpipe was almost completely rusted away, so we
went ahead and replaced it as well as the muffler.  The center section was
still fine, so I elected to keep it stock for now.  We replaced the stock
muffler with a Borla carbon fiber unit.  I think you can buy these through
regular channels, but they're very lightweight and cylindrical in shape, as
opposed to oval.  We then welded a massive B&B stainless steel 4" oval
tip--it fits perfectly between the valance and protrudes no more than the
stock tip did.  Sound is considerably more aggressive at idle, but it's not
obnoxious like the coffee can-sized pipes you see on a lot of Japanese
imports.  Any increase in noise at highway speed is almost imperceptible,
but under acceleration the sound is awesome.  There's a noticeable increase
in backpressure, no surprise.  Total cost was about $600.
