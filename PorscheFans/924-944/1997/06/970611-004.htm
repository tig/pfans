Glad you asked. The standard 968 CS had lowered suspension but had the
same spring rate and dampers as the standard 968. The main handling
improvement came from the weight reduction. The M030 option came with
bigger brakes, uprated springs and dampers. Both the CS and M030 came
with 17' wheels as standard. The CS could also be spec'd with M030 (
although I think it had a different option number to this, M030 was the
944 option code). There is a 968 CS M030 sitting on a dealers lot here
in Auckland it also has climate a/c not usually seen on CS cars.

Richard.

Lead article in this most recent issuse of Pano, refers to a 968 Club
Sport. What is the difference between this, and the 968 equipped with
the M030 option? TIA steve meltzer resurrected '88 944 turbo s, Zermatt
