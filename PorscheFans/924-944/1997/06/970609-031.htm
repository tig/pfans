Dear Kyle,

Yes, very true. Perhaps you could get Ron to describe his version?
It not, you can provide your own experiences with Ron, and then
list members can make their own decision.

I'm including this because it demonstates my point. Now we have 
some more information to consider.

I disagree. I think it's MOST proper to use this forum as a complaint 
department. How else are you to hear of unpleasant experiences? 
Certainly not from an ad in Pano.

I, for one, would like to know which vendors make people happy, 
and which ones don't. I don't have the resources to survey every
supplier in Pano and Excellense. But the list does, and I would
like to take advantage of that. 

Personally, I bought a clutch kit from Ron H at Eurospeed. I found Ron
very pleasant and knowedgeable to deal with (when I could get to him,
which was not easy). The kit arrived promptly, and the parts were as
advertised. However, the price was higher than I was led to believe
(not a lot, and not enough to cause me to stop recommending Ron). Since
then, a few friends have also had some problems with Ron. I no longer
recommend him, which is a shame because he seems like a very nice guy.
However, the bottom line is that some of my friends were disappointed
in his performance.

Other comments?
