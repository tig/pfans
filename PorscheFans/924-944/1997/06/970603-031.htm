The timing would have to be very far out for the engine to vibrate and
bent valves would be the result.  You stated that you just had belts
replaced.  If you had no vibration initially when you got the car back,
we can assume that the gears are on the balance shafts correctly.  You
also stated that you had a whirring noise.  The balance shaft has
probably slipped time (possibley the tensioner was not tightened
correctly). The idler has possibly failed, but you will find that out
when they go back into the covers to take a look.  Were the rollers
replaced when the belts were replaced??

Let me know and good luck...Don Istook
