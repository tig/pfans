HELP!!!

I am looking for someone who has personally done a 951 head gasket
replacement to include replacing the head studs.

I discovered after putting mine back together one of the failure modes
for the head studs.  It looks like the threads deform about the level of
the top of the head.

Two of mine did the same thing.

Any advice as to how to get the studs out of the block would be
appreciated.

Please e-mail me directly or call me at (302) 736-6613

Whoever did the headwork on my motor before I bought it must have had
Bozo the clown as his teacher.  I also had to helicoil two other over
torqued stripped bolts.

BTW:  I too have had to wait weeks in order to get parts out of Ron at
Eurospeed.  He also said he'd throw in an oil filter w/ my order, but
didn't.  It's not a big thing just the principle...
