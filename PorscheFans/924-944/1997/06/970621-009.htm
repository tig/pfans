The sound of your tail end hitting the trees as you lose it :-)

If this is a nice car why would you want to ruin it by making it into a
race car.  Just buy one that is already set up that way.  There aren't
that many nice street 951s left as it is.  It would be a shame to ruin
another '89.

>2. Trade the 951 in for a C2 NA right now.

I think you are just a young guy that gets bored with the status quo!  If
that is the case I don't think you will ever be happy with what you have
for long, no matter what it is.  The C2 would be a better car for around
town and auto-x since it has so much better throttle response.

=46or what it's worth, I just went through a bunch of my old =
Christophorus
magazines looking for some info on the 944 Turbo Cup cars... and guess
what?  Most editions of Christophorus during the mid to late 80s had many
more articles on the so-called "non-real" (water pumper variety) than the
"real" (air-cooled variety) Porsches.  Lots of stuff on 944 racing, 928,
etc.   Would the factory publish a magazine such as this if they did not
think all these cars were worthy of the Porsche name?  I think not.  To
many the last "real" Porsche ended with the demise of the 356.  Now =
that's
an even narrower viewpoint.

>1. I am losing to them in auto-x.

So what.  The 951 isn't exactly the greatest auto-x car in the world.
However, it is one of the best highway cars around.

>2. I have not owned a 911, they have owned several so I don't have any =
experience.

Neither have I, but I've driven quite a few of my Dad's cars in the past.
I liked them all, but none of them have anywhere near the creature
comforts of your '89 951.  You know... things like a heater and A/C =
system
that actually can heat and cool the car :-)  That counts for something up
in Oh-Canada.

I don't buy that statement at all.  Anyone who says that hasn't driven a
good 951, or they are just a snob.

I don't know why you can't be satisfied with it the way it is.  It will
never be a "new generation car," whatever means.  All the money you spend
on making it "better" will be down the drain when you sell it.  If you
were going to keep it for a long time it would be different.

>I don't know, I'm confused.  Everyone feels that my car needs some =
personality,

How about a set of nice Fikse wheels to make it stand out?  The problem
with the 951s is they are so competent and smooth that it is almost too
easy to drive fast... compared to the 911.  The main problems is once you
get used to the power the car is a bit boring because it is so smooth and
quiet.  At the track even an old 911 with open exhaust is more fun to
watch because it just sounds better, even though it may be going much
slower.

Anyway, let us know how the RS America is.  I saw a modified one here at
SIR a week ago and it sounded awesome and looked fantastic.  It was also
damn fast around the circuit.  Why not just buy that :-)
