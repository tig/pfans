My car is an early 1985, but I think the following would still apply:  It
sounds very likely that you either have a bad fan relay or a bad fan.  The
relay is certainly cheaper.  You did not mention if your car has A/C.  If
so, both fans should come on and stay on as long as the A/C is on.  The one
fan that comes on: does it sound as though it is going full speed?  If so,
the other is probably a bad fan or perhaps the wiring to it is suspect.  A
quick check with a VOM should tell if the (12 - 14) volts are getting to
the connector.  When you shut the hot engine down, do you hear the fan
continue to run at slow speed for a while? (it should).   

The lower temp thermo switch is not a bad idea.  I used one of these with
the stock radiator and it did cool things down better.  I have since
installed one of the Performance Products copper/brass replacement
radiatiors (after the 3rd aluminum/plastic radiator went kaput).  They are
expensive (about 2X) and mine was not quite an easy fit (some 'tweaking' of
car and rad was required, despite P.P.'s claims of 'bolts right in'). 
However, it does cool well and can be repaired if necessary.
