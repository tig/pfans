Khalid,
you may be thinking of the Audi RS2 (I think that's the model #).  I saw one at
the Paris car show about two years ago, and my understanding is that it's still
available in Europe.  It's a monster car:  It uses the Audi A6 wagon body (with
the obligatory flares and flaps and such), the wheels and brakes of the 911 (I
think), and a Porsche-modified version of the old Audi inline-5 (adding new
meaning to the phrase "unintended acceleration").  Quattro of course.   I don't
remember the exact performance figures, but I do remember thinking at the time
that it would give the 911 a run for the money.  And with space for the entire
family.  It's a shame Audi never sold it in the US -- it would have made the
perfect family car.  Perhaps the reason was that the price was about 100K US.
