I spent all day yesterday test driving new cars. I tried 'em all. None
could hold a candle to my 10 year old 944S with 165,000 kilometers on it.
The low RPM torque of the V8's was nice, the Volkswagon was pretty nimble
but none had the complete package. There wasn't one that felt as solid and
precise. I measure all cars by a downhill, off camber, decreasing radius
turn on Highway 99 about 40 klicks north of Vancouver. I didn't test one
car that I would be comfortable taking this corner at 100 KPH without
spending some time learning the car. The day I bought my Porsche I took the
corner at 120 KPH and didn't think twice. I just knew the car had it in it.
Once you have one of these cars how do you ever drive anything else?
