     Howdy PorscheFans,
     
     I have recently adopted a 1983 944.  It is my first experience with a 
     German car, much less a Porsche.  I have a stable of mechanical 
     beasties, but the bulk of them came from the UK or US.  The car is 
     silver / black leather sport seats, has the uprated suspension, has no 
     power steering, but has an auto transmission.  I bought it from the 
     original owner after the flex-disk that connects the driveline to the 
     engine had failed.  The owner, being 80 years old, decided that the 
     car was too hard to maintain and too hard to steer, so he let me have 
     it "real cheap" on condition that I fix it and see that it is cared 
     for.  It is on the road now and is a very nice car to drive!
     
     The fuel gauge is on strike more often than not, and when it does work 
     the needle jiggles and moves in an erratic fashion.  The temperature 
     gauge sometimes runs all the way to the peg on the hot end, but most 
     of the time it seems to function.  However, it seems very sensitive 
     and moves one or two quadrants in response to what are very minor 
     changes in conditions.  Most of the time it reads to the hot side of 
     center.  The car seems happy and does not show any symptom of 
     overheating, though.
     
     What is the likely cause?  Sending units?  Gauges?  Is there a ballast 
     resistor of some kind that could fail and make these gauges act 
     strange?  Grounding points behind the dash?  All input gratefully 
     accepted.
     
     Thanks!
     
     Doug Jones, Boulder Creek Calif.
