	We may have spoken before, but my 87 944S (102,000 miles) is similarly
afflicted.  I have posted several times and received recommendations to
dive into the engine to clean the idle stabilizer - replace the throttle
position sensor - check the 02 sensor...etc.  Its one of those lousy little
problems that doesn't disable the car (hence its easy to avoid fixing), but
certainly crops up at the most inopportune time (like when you're gonna
show that so and so in a VW Rabbitt how to accelarate hard out of a corner
and your Porsche goes into "burble" mode).

	I achieved some improvement this week by tightening all the hose clamps in
the air flow system and, believe it or not, adjusting the three nuts that
hold the air flow meter to the bracket on its top.  These appear to have to
actually achieve a certain amount of play ( I had tightened them some time
ago and it would create a horrible rattling when the idlemania started).  I
also have tweaked the throttle stop screw to maximize idle.  I would be
pleased to hear a real solution.

	While I'm wasting space, I just noticed that my front bumper appears to
have been pushed in on one side. This may have been there forever, but now
that I've seen it, I'm embarrassed to leave the garage.  What's the
repair???
