NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO <-get the idea?

Personally, I have no problem with images. However, considering 
how fragile the PorscheFans servers appears to be, I don't
think sending images around is a good idea. For those of you
who are not that computer literate, images take up a LOT of
bandwith (space) on the system, and put a heavy load on the
resources. 

If people start sending images around PorscheFans, you can forget 
about PorscheFans working. It will croak pretty quickly.

I suggest that if you have an image you think people would be
interested in, you inform people you have the image.  Anyone who wants
it will ask you for it, and youcan then mail it directly. Better yet,
find some web page and put it there.
