*****

The 1997 Monterey Historics will feature Shelby as the honored "marque."
Porsche was bumped to 1998 and Alfa is tentatively scheduled for 1999.  The
Ferrari contingent is always big at the Concours Italiano, held away from
the track at the Quail Lodge Resort in Carmel Valley.  This year's CI
features DeTomaso, but there will be a special 50th anniversary event
planned to honor Ferrari.  No matter what year you attend, Porsches are
well represented.
