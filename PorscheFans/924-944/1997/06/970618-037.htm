Hello Naweed.

I know what you mean, let me reiterate the fact that I own both facets!  I
love the "ness" you are reffering to.  My dream is to own a Porsche 911! I
love that car! The sound, unique feel, that aura which makes a
Porsche a  Porsche is not able to be recreated. In my Junior speech I
vehemently professed the correct pronunciation of Por SHA to my entire school.



Can't say the same for the muscle

True but muscle cars have their own special aura.  As for the tacky
addons on the stangs, probably for the wannabees to think they are cool.

This love of driving is not the same as the "hey, look

Yes! I know, it is almost as fun to drive my dad's 911 at 35 as it is at 100
(on a racetrack of course). This is part of the Porsche beauty. But that
feeling of being SLAMMED to
the back of your seat is not able to be replaced either; this is the
muscle car beauty.  


Porsches are not made for the masses - muscle cars
> are.  

Actually not! True, and I stress TRUE, muscle cars are for a select group of
individuals who
are willing to pay the mediocre gas mileage, terrible insurance,
condescending looks from more haughty drivers, and maybe a rougher ride for
that earthshaking V8 rumble, and that SWEET acceleration.  The V6 cars and
other wannabees are not included in the grouping of muscle cars in my
book.  Also, true muscle cars owners _live_ for that part in the creation of
their beast; the modifications.   

> To each his own.  I saw your home page.  Are you for real??  

As opposed to being a figment? ;) I suppose ;)

Spending all that

Under $700 dollars?

With a '89 951 would I get a trouble free 100K miles? A factory
warranty? Could I trade it in in two years and not lose my a$$? Would I be
able to do things to the car for under a few grand that made a difference I
could feel? Would all of the rubber in the
car go bad and incur thousands of dollars in new factory parts?  I am a
student, I need a reliable car.  If I was out of school sure maybe that
would be a viable option. 

> How about a 930 that's been through a RUF conversion?  That's a smoker!

Ah yes,  when I get through Medical school I will have my own 911.  Yes,
probably a Turbo.  But even when I can afford one I will still retain both
facets of automobiledom ;) 

The bottom line is the two types of cars are too different to compare.  I
love my Firebird, My dad's past muscle cars (GTO, 67 vette... more); but
on the other hand  I also love my dad's 911, our 924, and our two past
914s. I still might have yet another 914 in my future!

Can't we all just appreciate the differences among them? 

Also the 1977 924 doesn't possess the "ness" in the same degree as the 914s
and 911.

BTW this is also just my opinion....
