I had a pretty bad experience recently at a local Porsche race shop and now I need 
to remedy the situation. I'm asking the collective wisdom of the group for advice.

To make a long, miserable story as short as possible, the shop only put one quart 
of gear oil in my transmission two months ago when they changed the transmission 
oil on my 944S. I immediately returned the car to them the next day because of all 
the mechanical noise in the rear of the car. They assured me it was just because I 
wasn't using the synthetic Swepco.

Anyway, this went on for the past two months until an excellent dealership in 
Maryland (Tischer Auto Park) diagnosed the problem immediately (I was there for 
them to look at the clutch I thought was failing) and drained/filled the trans for 
me--for free! MOST of the noises have gone away, but I now have plenty of what I 
would say sounds like "gear whine"--a vibration and rattling on deceleration and 
sometimes on acceleration at 2000rpms.

Since the transmission was in great shape (and totally quiet) before this mishap, I 
fully intend to have the first shop rebuild the transmission for free and **want to 
know what other components they should replace for me while they're in there**.

BTW, I still trust the first shop since they are extremely reputable in this area 
(really!). I believe this was just one of those horrible mistakes you usually only 
read about.
