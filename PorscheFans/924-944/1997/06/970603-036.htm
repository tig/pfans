Briefly, turn the ignition switch from off to the FIRST detent. Press the
sunroof switch on the console. You should hear the motor operate and if you
look at the rear hinges, you should be able to see the locking mechanism
move to the unlocked position. Once that is done, the rear of the sunroof
should be loose so that it lifts easily away from the roof. If so, unlock
the front locks, raise the sunroof from the back to verticle and lift it
off. Please note, the sunroof will not unlock if you have the ignition
switch in the wrong position: it must be in the first detent. It is not
uncommon in a car as old as yours for the sunroof to not operate. There have
been many, long strings on this list about sunroofs not working and how to
fix them.  good luck.

Mike
