Relocate to Montana. You can go as fast as you like every day. So long
as you are reasonable and prudent about it.

Fellow PFans,

I recall recently reading a thread where people discussed the pros and
cons
of speeding during the Superbowl...

Well this week I have been able to enjoy the benefits of such an
experience.
 I live in Chicago and of course the Bulls are in the NBA playoffs -
Well I
don't know anyone here who is not a Bulls fan.  Me of course,  I am from
out
of town/country so can tolerate missing the odd game or three....

So - Sunday night the phenomenon first occurs - I find myself driving
between
my girlfriend's house and mine - usually takes 15-20 minutes - took 5
minutes
 - no traffic let alone Police cars.  I guess cops like basketball too.

Last night on my way home from work - 10 minutes before the game starts
-
usually takes 1 hour - Did it in 25 minutes - Man it was nice to clear
the
cobwebs outta my 944,  I forgot how well it held the road at 100MPH
plus...


Now the dilemma - If the Bulls don't make it to the playoffs next year -
I
will have to relocate...    Any ideas on what teams might be in the
playoffs
next year?  I could handle a short stint in NY or maybe even Boston?

How about the Superbowl???  Anyone know who's making the next Super
Bowl?

<Sorry about the band-width but I had to share this with someone...>
