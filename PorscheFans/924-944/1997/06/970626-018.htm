Hi Pfans

Just wanted to let everyone know I am back, safe and sound, from Parade in
San Antonio.  Had a great time.  It was nice to meet face to face with
Jason Burkett and George B.  BTW, in case no one else has announced the
news, Jason won his (and my) class in the autocross and also won his class
in the charity slalom, and George won the overall award in the men's
division of the tech quiz (he even admitted that this list helped him a
lot).
I took a trophy for fourth in the autocross (out of seven cars), and
finished fourth in SOP, ninth overall in the TSD rallye (88 SOP cars, 110
total on rallye).
All in all, it was a very nice week, albeit a little warm and sometimes wet.
Anyway, it will probably take me a couple of days to catch up on all that
has transpired on the list (as well as daily business), so if I'm not too
active until next week, you will understand.
