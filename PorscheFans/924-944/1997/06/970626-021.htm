That is such a simplistic answer....the S2 is a great car!
A lot depends on what kind of driving you will be doing, where (stop
and go?, city? hwy? racing?) How much $ you want to spend on maintenance
a year (turbo's mucho $). How much you want to pay in insurance (some
insurance companies will not insure the turbo if you have a bad driving
record.)
So, you can't blow the doors off everyone at every light...call me
every 30k miles when you need a new clutch due to those launches,
call me when you need to change your turbo, waste gate, and God knows
what else. The S2 has decent performance, it is priced realistically
(about $10-$13k) it has the turbo body, much better torque; it is much
easier on your wallet, much easier on your insurance (specially of
your young and single) and it is avail. as a cabrio! with back seats,
I might add. My next choice would be the 968. More torque and with
a few grand, about $3K, in improvements you can match the performance
of an 88/89 turbo S (check out Powerhaus.com. You can get 272hp from
the 968 at little expense) Nice updated body and avail. in cabrio
as well. No back seat, however. Better, stronger clutch, 4 caliber
brakes, vario cam...

well, that is a tough choice. the easy part is forget the S2. of those three
choices it is the 968 or the turbo S. the turbo S will be the fastest and
will also have the most potential to increase if you ever want to make it a
real super kick ass car. however, the 968 will be the most drivable on a
daily basis since the power band is so much smoother. those are both great
cars. i think you cant buy either based on future value, you have to deicde
what you want to do with the car and then see which suits your tastes. if you
tell me just want you want to do with the car for the most part i can try to
give you some more advice. best of luck - Doug
