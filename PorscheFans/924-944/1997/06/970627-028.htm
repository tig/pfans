On a similar note, attachments like those graphics are not very friendly
for digest recipients (like myself).  MIME attachments of any kind which
are encapsulated into a daily digest are next to impossible to extract --
this is because the digesting process rips out the MIME headers necessary
for recognizing message data as separate attachments.  Thus, all us digest
recipients get is scores of screens filled with Base64 encoded garbage. 

It's not just a matter of upgrading my mailer to the latest/greatest 
internet thang .... I can do MIME attachments just fine, but not when the 
sender (porschefans) rips out and re-formats the message beyond my 
mailers ability to parse body subsections into attachments.

And besides, the 924-944 digest by itself already averages about 100k
daily ... adding in MIME encoded graphic content only bloats that up
unreasonably (especially when it's next to impossible to extract the
attachments).

I have no beef with images either -- pictures often make difficult
descriptions easier to understand. However, it's much nicer to everyone
(recipients, servers, Internet, etc.) if big graphics and other such
attachments are put out to some FTP or WWW server, where they can be
downloaded as needed.

[please don't get me wrong here ... I'm not trying to rip up the person 
who did all of us a service by making nice pictures available for his 
article ... I'm just offering my $.02 on what kind trouble things like 
attachemnt e-mailing can cause]
