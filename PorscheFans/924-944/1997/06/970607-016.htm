	Sure, this is easy. Before I owned my 944, I had a Toyota Celica
	GT. Not exaclty like an RX-7 but in the same ballpark. It was
	white/black and I liked it alot. I put white letter tires on it.
	It looked really cool. But you know what it really was? It was 
	a Japanese econobox inside with a semi-aggressive body draped
	over it. It was the Jennifer Aniston of cars. Looks with no
	substance. The 944 (and other Porsches) are like Jaqueline
	Bisset. All looks and substance (sorry for any implied sexism
	here, this is the best I can come up with on short notice).
	If I were to view, then drive a Ceclica or RX-7, or 300 ZX
	now, I would say great looking car...and then I'd be very
	disappointed once I'd driven it and seen what it really
	is, a pretender. Some other factors; shoddy worksmanship.
	Ever seen the interior of one these Japanese cars after 
	150K on them? It often looks like a bomb went off inside
	the car. Imagine what the inside of the engine looks like.
	My 944 with 115K pulls as strong and as fast as it ever did.
	That is definitly something you won't get from your RX-7 after
	100K. Satisfaction. There is no comprison. I mean really, which
	would you rather have a Mazda RX-7 or a Porsche? Anyway, that's
	my view on the subject. Good luck with the search!
