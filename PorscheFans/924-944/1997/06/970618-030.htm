OK I can't resist this any longer.
I happen to belong to both sides of the muscle vs Porsche debate. I have a 86na that I love for it's refined handling and the quality of the construction and design. Great car. I also own a 66' Shelby Gt-350 - ex track car. You cannot compare the two vehicles. The GT-350 does amazing 4 wheel drifts, you steer it with the throttle not the steering wheel and you smile all the time, well at least until you can't hear anymore and your body is getting sore. The 944 on the other hand, is the car my wife will ride in without complaining about how fast I'm going or how deep in to the turns I wait to brake. I can actually hear the stereo in the 944! I usually feel more refreshed after a trip in the 944 that when I began the ride.
Anyway- you can't compare these two different types of vehicle, they have different purposes. (I actually don't care much for the stereotypical mustang 5.0 driver)
As for the NASCAR v F1 debate I give the same answer. You can't compare. I like them both but for different reasons. F1 is a high tech big bucks battle. Great technology combined with colorful drivers and more money than I'll ever see. It is also quite silly at times. They hardly allowed any practice time. I belive they said this was to keep the cost down (!!) 
NASCAR on the other hand is like a high speed chess match. Rarely does one car dominate a race like in F1. Strategy and judging traffic is just as important as the car setup. If you know the personalities of the drivers the racing is much more interesting to watch. (BTW the Intimidator needs a new nickname, he doesn't scare anyone anymore)
Personally I liked club racing back in the 70's and 80's before everybody got an $attitude$.

PS- Just got my wife a BWM, does that cancel my list membership??
