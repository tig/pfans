Hello everybody,

This is a burning question from Holland. I own a 944 S2 Turbo ('86) and
i sometimes have problems with the turbo pressure. It dosn't built
enough pressure so that it seems like the wastegate dosn't work normaly.
Can it be that it is not closing enough to built up the pressure well?
I always want to know everything that is going on with my piece of art
on wheels, just in case.
By the way, i realy like this list, it's very nice to read all this from
so many others who share the same hobby.
If someone has any idea about my problem, please let me know. (I'm going
nuts not knowing this)

Thanks a lot so far, 

Will Bonestoo, 944 Turbo S2 '86

Hi, I recently bought an '81 924.  I don't really know anyone that has much
experience with these cars, and I have alot of questions as well as a parts
wish list.  Well, here it goes:

Where can I get cheap parts?  Is there some mail order house that has
consitantly inexpensive prices?

My odometer doesn't work.  The speedometer does.  Is this a common problem?
 Any ideas?

The gas gauge jumps.  When it does, it is off about a quarter tank.  What
is up with this?

The filter sucks air through a small hole.  Should I modify the "air
restrictor" in any way such as cutting it off?

I have a leak in the front passenger side.  I was told that it is probably
the battery compartment.  The person that told me so said that he could fix
it with fiberglass for $50.  I have an arc welder.  Should I do it with
sheat metal, or should I pay the guy $50 to do it?

I have the electric defogging side view mirrors with motors.  On the
passenger side mirror, the mount for the glass seems to be about a
centimeter down from where it should be, causing the glass to be off
center.  The motor still works, but the things stays down.  Anyways, the
glass has fallen off, and when I replace it, I would like to fix the
mounting as well.  Will I need to replace the motor?  Anywhere know where
to get either cheaply?

Is there a place that I can get the little plastic seals that go around the
door handles and latches and things like that?  The Porsche dealer is not
very helpful....

The seal around the area where the sunroof sits looks pretty generic.  Can
it be bough as a non Porsche part at a reasonable price?  Where might I
find it.

My front wheels seem wobly.  It seems to be that the struts woble, although
they seem to compress correctly.  Will replacing them give me much better
handling?  Are they hard to replace?

Are there any ways to really boost the performance inexpensivly?  I just
passed emmisions, so I can get away with quite a bit for a while.  I
already have racing headers.

I have heard something about being able to put disk breaks from a super
beattle onto the back of the 924.  Is this possible?  Is it easy?

Do 924s come stock with anti-sway bars?  If not, are they a worth-while
upgrade?

I was looking at an '80 924 turbo, and it made me think about selling mine
and getting it.  It was sooooo much faster...  Anyways, it did seem to have
a problem with the clutch or the tranny.  Whenever I tried to go quickly
from first gear to second, it would make a small grinding feeling/noise.  I
was not able to drive it much, and I am not used to the european shift
pattern, but it really didn't seem right.  Also, the steering and shifting
were both really stiff compared to my 924.  Any ideas on what the shift
grinding might be.  Is it any easy thing to fix?  How about the stearing. 
I really like the ease of steering in my 924.  Can it be made to be not as
stiff?

Anything else I should know about with these cars?

Here is my parts wish list.  If you have an of the parts in good shape, or
know where to get them at great deals (new or used), let me know:
-  *** Driver side front seat in black. ***
-  Starter solenoid (or starter and solenoid)
-  Passenger side tail light lense.
-  Passenger side side view mirror glass and mabey motor.
-  Front Strut Cartridges. (new)
If you have alot of parts, let me know, there are some more obscure part
that I need, but I can't really explain them easily.
