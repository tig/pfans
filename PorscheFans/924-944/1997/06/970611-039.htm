Michael,

I had a problem kinda similar to yours a while back on my 944. For
me, it was an intermittent electrical connection to one of my fuel
injectors. When the connection would break, I'd be running on three
cylinders only, causing symptoms very much like yours (power loss,
vibration, change in engine note). It took me forever to find it
though, because it always fixed itself before I could figure it
out.

If I were you, I'd check anything that could knock out one cylinder
completely. Could be an injector, spark plug, plug wire, etc. Just
make sure everything is plugged in good and tight. Intermittent
problems are hard to find sometimes, but they usually aren't too
serious. Hopefully, you just need to pinpoint what's come loose.

Or I could be totally wrong!  :)

Good luck,

ROG - '84 944 Alpine White

P.S. How did I hide my jealousy? Two 968's? You so lucky!
