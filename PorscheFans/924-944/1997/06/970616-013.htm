Anyway, in 4th today at 70? mph,
3500 on the tach gas a little low,
but no reserve light yet,push the throttle
to the floor, 5 seconds acceleration,
cut off, hard decel, let off the gas,
engine back in.  Max tach 4500
rpm.  It felt like the rev limiter had
cut in, so I thought, well, maybe I just
misread the tach.  Tried again, same
thing, looked stupid in front of yellow 95
Corvette.  Got gas, engine temp ok,
no idiot lights and oil pressure
ok, central warning ok.  I ran the
car up to 6200rpm at the gas station, no load,
no problem.  Held the rpm for 10 seconds,
let it slowly drift back to idle, ok. (Anyone
here ever check magneto A & B on a single engine
aircraft?)  I haven't run under load again yet at full
throttle, it is raining here so I
took the car home at lunch and got the
82 Audi out to run until it dries out.
Any ideas?  I mean, acceleration in 4th
should not be enough to slosh the fuel
back out of the pickup should it?  What
is the amount of fuel in the tank just before
the reserve light kicks in?  If it was a gas 
problem have I damaged the fuel pump?  Is
this some kind of fuel cutoff I don't know 
about that the brain does if fuel is low?
Could detonation (I did not hear any) cause
the brain to retard timing this much?  Sigh.
Lastly, the A/C was working fine until 
yesterday.  Yesterday was warm.  Yesterday
the compressor decided that it was not going
to engage at all.  Fuse ok and relay well
seated; I have not checked the pressure
yet in the system.  Does anyone know of a cheap
place to buy Freon?  Porsche makes a nice car,
but sometimes the cars can be expletive deleted
annoying.
