Folks,
Just had something happen.  A good lesson re-learned.  Luckily nothing
hurt.   I was driving my '86 951 (52K miles) home down a 2 mile stretch
of smooth pavement-good place to take the RPM's up, in 3rd, 4th, into
5th. Then slowing down for the turn, I noticed a new, sweet smell. 
Thats weird. Maybe a nearby dumpster?  At the stop, I noticed the heat
guage slowly moving upwards, to just under the 3/4 white mark.  Uh-oh. 
OK, kick in, aux fan.  Then a guy in a truck said, "hey, you're leaking
anti-freeze".  I coasted into the drive and opened the hood. At the rear
of the engine, just under the last intake manifold tube and below a
couple of cables, a small hose was off of a metal male receptor.  I
don't know exactly what is cooled by this particular fitting
(anti-freeze smoking on a hot manifold certainly clears your sinuses). 
Luckily no damage, except for anti-freeze on the inside firewall and
components which will wash off.
