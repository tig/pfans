	Hi!
I do not know what is 944 S2 turbo, but if it is anything like US. 951, 
there a few test for you to try if you are suspecting boost controlling
circuit (cycling valve, wastegate, etc...).
	Get a good manometer to be able to get accurate boost pressure
	readings.

	Check Compressor Bypass Valve (CBV). It is a little black can with
	three connections (two larger, and one smaller). It sits on top
	of a Rubber Sleeve(RS) that goes from air flow meter to the turbo 
	fresh air intake. The other larger fitting of CBV connects 
	with the metal pipe from intercooler to throttlebody.

	1 Take out CBV, hold it so that smallest (vacuum) fitting is 
	pointing up, give a horizontal fitting a good blow job, it 
	should not leak.

	2 Try the above step, but connect a source of vacuum (18 in Hg)
	to the smallest tube, you should be able to freely blow into it.

	3 Try sucking on the small tube, it should hold vacuum

Conclussions
	If any of the three cases fail, replace CBV.
	The failure in step 1 could be the cause of low boost.


	1 Pinch the rubber part of the hose that leads from the 
	banjo bolt in the Intercooler Pipe(IP).
WARNING	Go for a ride (very carefully do not overboost).
WARNING	Do not forget to remove this clamp after the test.

Conclusions
	If a car feels like it just got a steroid injection 
	(you should get full boost and then some) your 
	problem is probably the Cycling Valve(CV). 

	Unless you have
	superhuman upper extremities, you will need to remove
	intake manifold to get to it. It is a three connection
	electrically operated air valve. At any given time 
	the air from the  IP connected side is bled to the 
	WasteGate(WG) control or into the RS to the intake of the
	turbo. As a safety feature this CV is normally (unpowered)
	allowing the wastegate to see the full pressure,
	thus forcing it open. Your KLR controls boost 
	pressure by electrically activating the CV.
	Once the CV is out it can be tested.


	1 Get under the cold car in the morning, start it, or vice 
	versa, and touch the small exhaust pipe that leaves 
	WG.

Conclussion
	if hot, it is probably your WG.

The above tests should narrow your problem down, if not fix it.
You could also have an air leak under pressure somewhere. I do 
not know how to find those, may be compressed air and soap water
can help.

In a few recent threads, there was a talk that not all the cars
see the full boost unless under WOT. With that in mind if your
throttle cable is not adjusted properly, you may never see WOT,
and full power.


All of the above tests are suggestions, they worked for me,
there are no guarantees.

		Good Luck Len.
