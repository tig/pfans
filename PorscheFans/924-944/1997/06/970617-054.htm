With the updated .04 mounts, you no longer need to use the 4 mm spacer washers 
used with earlier versions.  The 4 mm is now built into the mount itself.

The bolt length to be used depends on the height of the foot of the bracket 
which runs between the engine block and the motor mount.  One the right side, 
always use M8 x 38 bolts.  On the left, use 38 mm bolts if the bracket foot 
measures 21 mm, use 42 mm bolts if it measures 25 mm.

You can get the bolts anywhere you please.  Because they're cheap, and 
particularly with oddball sizes like 38 and 42 mm, I would order them from 
Porsche.

Subject:	Turbo mounts upgrade

I have an 85.5 '44 that I would like to upgrade to turbo engine 
mounts (one's busted already anyway).

Do the longer bolts required for the upgraded mounts come with the 
mounts?  If not, how many and what size do I need?  Can I just get 
my own Wurth bolts or do they have to be P-dealer ones?

How long should this job take?  I may get this done (since I'm not 
around right now) and would like to get a realistic time estimate for 
this kind of job.

Thanks.
