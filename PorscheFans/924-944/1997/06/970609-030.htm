It seems that over the past few months this list has become a forum from
which to launch verbal attacks.  The latest offering is a long diatribe
against Ron Horton and EuroSpeed. =20

I, personally, have found Ron Horton to be a conscientious and honest
businessman.  He offers some of the best prices in the country combined w=
ith
timely service.  Ron is also a Porsche owner, enthusiast and supporter of
PCA.

Anyone can have a bad experience.  It=92s understandable that this episod=
e
caused the author of the post to reconsider his purchase decision, as he =
did.
 Yet, I hasten to add that we are only hearing one side of this story.

Therefore, it is unfair and improper for anyone to use this forum as thei=
r
personal =93complaint department.=94  Particularly when it is hidden unde=
r that
guise that they are offering the rest of the list members some consumer
awareness.  Think before flaming.
