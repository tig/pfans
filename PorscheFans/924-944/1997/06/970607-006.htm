	Ben, you'll find that high performance exhaust and header upgrades
	for the 944 are insanely expensive compared to what you get; a few
	hp at most. Ditto for the chips. There's not much you can do to
	make your car go faster. There are some things you can do to make
	it seem faster. Get the $30 throttle cam upgrade from one of the
	mail order houses (Performance Products, I think). It makes the
	throttle more responsive and you feel like you're faster. Consider
	some suspension upgrades. Not only does this improve the handling
	of your car, but the "tighter" your car is, the "faster" it will
	seem to go. You can do what I am currently doing in the meantime
	if you like; learn to drive the daylights out of your 944, then
	when you feel like you've learned all you can, upgrade to the
	951. Good luck!
