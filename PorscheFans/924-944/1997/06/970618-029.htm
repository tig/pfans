>This is one fantastic car !!! We put about 2500mi on it in 5days and had a GREAT

**Welcome! I have and '89 S2 and love it. Been thinking of a '93 RS America, but
can't get myself to sell the S2. I may totally abandon my pursuit after your
note.
One problem; not many inexpensive performance upgrades for it. No K&N filter,
for example***

>1. the rear hatch won't open with the key. I can hear a "click", but it won't 
>unlatch. It works from the button inside though.

The adjustable locks may be too short/tight. Try to loosen a bit.

>2. The luggage cover won't retract. It has no spring tension. One of my sons pulled 
>it out, and it will not go back onto the roller. I took it out of the car, and will 
>get back to it when I have time.

Mine did that a few times but I discovered it only did it in summers
during very hot weather. When cold, it worked fine and have not had problems

>3. The windshield wipers will not go to the stop position when turned off. I can get 
>them parked be using the lever- but there must be a better way.  Also, the 
>intermitten position does not work??

Can't help you there. I now that the unit at the steering wheel tends to get
worn out. My windshield washer i not spraying, for example.

>Also, the car doesn't catch on the first rev of the engine like my 911 does. It 
>turns over 3-4 times before starting. No problem, but the 911 fires as soon as you 
>hit the key!! I,m changing plugs this weekend, but is this a normal S2 procedure. It 
>always starts and goes right to idle.

Normal. Mine does the same, about twice. They are some mighty big cylinder you are
waking up.
