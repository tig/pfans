Love your discussion, but a revision.

**For the one shown after the CART Detroit Grand Prix, I believe 'Little
Al' Unser Jr. won with a NASCAR boy taking second.  Actually, this isn't
Al's first win.  He does very well against all those NASCAR drivers.
:-)

Too bad for Jacques Villenueve spinning himself out on the second lap at
Montreal.  :-(

>Yes I am very familiar with the IROC races (International Race Of
Champions).
I saw the first of four after the Detroit Grand Prix on June 8th.  It is
no
surprise to me at all that the NASCAR drivers would win.  I would expect
that.
Reason - quite simply I see the IROC series as just another type of
NASCAR race.
These cars are closer to what the NASCAR drivers are used to than are
the open
top cars that CART, IRL, IMSA drivers are used to, so naturally the
NASCAR
drivers have a huge advantage. Turn the tables for a second now - if
Dale
Earnhardt (a.k.a. The Intimidator) was to race against Michael Schumaker
at
LeMans both in a 911GT1 - who do you think would win?

>Not trying to start something here - just giving my .02 opinion FWIW!

Ditto!
