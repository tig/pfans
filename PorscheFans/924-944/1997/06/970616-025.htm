Steve,


Check the throttle stop for the throttle cam (providing the 944S works the same
as the other 944).  If the throttle stop is to low, the engine will drop down
to too low of rpms to be able to catch itself (before the motronic re-adjusts
itself for sudden off the throttle applications).  I haven't actually had
problems with this, but just read something about the existance of a throttle
stop to catch the throttle short of actually closing.  (there should be a screw
on the throttle housing to adjust the stop)  The screw *does* not adjust idle,
only the stop.  I'll have to re-read what I read before...


The air flow meter could be the problem.  The best thing to do is try and find
someone else who will lend you one, or buy one, try it out and send if back if
that (the airbox) isn't the problem.
