I don't accept either of these two points. I drive my 951 every day, I
have never experienced any problem with off boost torque not being
adequate. Maintenance; apart from an extra oil change I don't see
differences in basic running costs. People may use any argument they
wish to justify purchasing a S2 but I'll still beat them through the
corner and come out in a very nice 4 wheel drift and then leave them to
be hounded by a fleet of VR6s.

On the other hand, the S2 is probably a better car for driving around
town
because of its low-end torque. Plus, maintenance costs and reliability
are
almost certainly better than with a 951.
