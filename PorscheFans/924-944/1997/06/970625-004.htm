Two new switches worked for me. To be effective, the swithes must not only
form a closed circuit when depressed, they must open another circuit. When
the metal gets fatigued it can no longer do this. The new swithes do not
have those annoying ball bearings as pivots. (The ones that tend to jump
out)
