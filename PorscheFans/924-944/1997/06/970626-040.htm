Oh, for the camshaft you hold it with a large wrench on the nut shaped shaft 
that the rotor attaches to. If you keep the cambelt on while you do this, and 
the camshaft accidentally rotates, you won't damage anything. The bolt is one 
of those cheesehead/star shaped 12 point deals. Make sure your wrench is of 
high quality, and is properly seated, or you can strip it out. Then remove the 
housing section the seal attaches to, this will allow you to replace the 
o-ring, and that thin clear plastic washer in addition to the seal.

Good Luck!
          Ezra

     That is such a simplistic answer....the S2 is a great car!
     A lot depends on what kind of driving you will be doing, where (stop
     and go?, city? hwy? racing?) How much $ you want to spend on 
     maintenance
     a year (turbo's mucho $).
     
     
        Why does everyone say this?  It isn't THAT much more expensive, and
     I can imagine 4-valve repairs approximating the cost of repairs to  
     the turbo models.  All 944's seem to be plagued by a similar group   
     of problems which aren't really exclusive to a particular model.  Sure 
     there may be boost problems with the 951, but so much of the 951 is 
     reinforced or improved over NA 944's that they may resist the problems 
     that more commonly afflict their NA brothers.  The 951 is also a great 
     car, and I agree this choice depends on what the owner intends to do 
     with the car.
     
     
     The S2 has decent performance, it is priced realistically
     (about $10-$13k)
     
     
        Great 951's can be bought within this price range too...
     
     
     it has the turbo body, much better torque
     
     
        I have to disagree (personal opinion about what "better" torque 
     means).  The S2 will have better low-end torque, but once that boost 
     kicks in (and it will kick in even lower and stronger with a chip), 
     the 951 is a beast.  The chip thing reminds me of another advantage of 
     the 951-- there are many more affordable and effective performance 
     mods available.
     
     
     it is much
     easier on your wallet, much easier on your insurance (specially of
     your young and single)
     
     
        I'm 20 now and when I was researching insurance premiums with       
     different agencies, the premium differences between 951's and NA's 
     were negligible (less than $150/year; some companies didn't even care 
     if it was turbo or not, and relied more on age and value of car).  My 
     age and driving record alone seemed to dictate how high my premiums 
     would be (I was 17 and single when I bought my 951, with no tickets 
     and 1 not-at-fault accident that nevertheless ruined my first 944), 
     and the car I drove didn't really affect my rates.  I would be paying 
     a similar amount of money if I had bought a Pontiac instead.  The only 
     case where I can imagine a 951 costing more than an S2 to insure would 
     be if the individual had a history of moving violations and the 
     insurance company actually chose to take hp and performance into 
     consideration (but this is almost unheard of these days).  The 
     difference between 243 hp (951S) and 208 hp (S2) isn't that much, 
     anyway.  They're both 2 door sportscars!
     
     and it is avail. as a cabrio! with back seats,
     
        There are turbo cabriolets available too, but they are rare.
     
        Please understand that I am merely trying to clear up some 
     misconceptions about the 951, just as many of you have already done 
     for the S2 model.  A lot of times, facts and trivial details really 
     have nothing to do with how one chooses a car.  I suggest the original 
     poster try and test drive each and then determine which car "feels" 
     the best.  I bet he/she will enjoy each car's individual characters 
     thoroughly, but in the end will probably only fall in love with the 
     one car that matches his/her desires and needs.
