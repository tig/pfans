This sounds like an interesting idea!  Please keep us informed.  I like the
idea of the gas analysis, or any other empirical comparison technique you
can dream up.

The price is right, but I would be somewhat embarrassed to ask for a
Mustang part.  I would have to wait until all the other customers had left.
Only then, when I have affixed my nose-mustasche-glasses disguise would I
mumble - "give me one of those Ford Mustang, eh, er, 5.0 oxygen sensors
please".
