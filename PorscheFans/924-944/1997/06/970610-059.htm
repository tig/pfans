Hi Guys,

Here's one that should start some discusion!

Are all Bosch oxygen sensors the same?
(within the same family ie 1 wire or 3 wire)

I've used one of the universal one wire units for my 82 931 and 
it has worked very well.  Cost about $30 and you just crimp 
the new unit onto your old O2 sensors harness.

After looking around on the web for info on O2 sensors
I found the Volvo and SAAB camps are using the Ford Mustang 5.0
O2 sensor for replacement on the 3 wire units as Bosch
sells no universal three wire.  

Well I was skeptical.  Went to the AutoZone and after firts checking 
on a 951 unit to no avail, I asked about the 5.0 Ford unit.  He brought 
one out with 16" leads three wire Bosch unit.  $37 price.  Thought I'd
try it out and did an O2 sensorectomy today.  Just cut off the 
Ford terminal and soldered on the Porsche unit.  Appearls to 
be right on the money.  I might just have to buy a Porsche unit
to check the cheap version against the factory unit on a gas analyzer.
I'd hate to have this thing on the lean side!

Any comments????     Previous experiences?????
