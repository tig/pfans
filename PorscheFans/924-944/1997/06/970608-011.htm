This is a cosmetics question:  I recently changed job locations and no =
longer have the luxury of parking in a garage at work, so my 91 944 S2 =
now sits outside in the elements during the day.  After the last two =
weeks of nearly constant rainfall, I noticed some cloudy-white spots on =
the hood.  As I live in a rather damp climate, I really try hard to =
protect my car's paint (guards red).  I have it professionally detailed =
twice a year, and I put a coat of Zymol Creme Polish on it myself every =
six to eight weeks.  I also go over it with Meguiar's Quik Detailer =
about twice a week.  So I'm surprised to find water infiltrating the =
finish.  Any advice about what to do about the spots, and how to prevent =
them in the future?

Also, I now have to commute a dozen mostly freeway miles to work every =
day.  I worry about pitting and chipping.  I recently purchased a Colgan =
bra, but I've heard bras can do damage to the paint as well.  Any =
advice?  Thanks.
