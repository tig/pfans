Subject: 944 cam housing oil leak
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Recently, I discovered an oil leak on my '84 944 that I have traced to
the frontmost outside corner of the cam housing, right behind the
distributor. A new cam housing gasket was installed 14 months ago after
a timing belt broke under the PO, resulting in a total top-end rebuild,
which I had done at local shop. I can see fresh oil coming out at that
point, and am certain it is not coming from the oil cooler (which was
rebuilt 3 years ago under same PO, according to maintenance records).
Checked the cam housing bolts, and they are tight (at least the lower
ones, which are out in the open).

I am wondering: how involved is the gasket replacement to the
mechanically inclined, non-mechanic owner (me). Checked a few shops in
the SF Bay area; one said he uses some special "cam holding" tools,
another said he's gotten by without such. Another said maybe the head is
warped, and the head gasket might need replacement, too...hmm. All say
the job is about 4-5 hours and the gaskets about $40. Is this correct?

The motor seems that it runs a bit hot to me compared to my old 85.5 944
(upon opening the hood) but maybe that's my impression of the heat
coming off the Bursch headers. Temp gauge climbs into the high zone with
engine running (but no warning exclamation light), and immediately goes
to normal (low-middle range) with key ON and motor OFF when I park it. I
have attributed this to gauge/sensor old age (maybe I am wrong here?) as
the lamps on the temp gauge and clock both quit a few months ago, and I
have not had a chance to trace it to a fuse or bad ground yet.

My old shop has moved away from street cars to concentrate on their race
projects, so a recommendation of a reliable shop between San Francisco
and San Jose would be gratefully appreciated...and thanks for any advice
from the list!

I'm adding oil to replace the loss, oil pressure is good, motor getting
dirty..argggg.
