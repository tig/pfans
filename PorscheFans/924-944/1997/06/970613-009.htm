I have had an  intermittent problem in my '89 944S2. The car runs great but
sometimes it won't start. It cranks fine but won't catch. After a while it then
starts and runs just fine for months. This has happened maybe 10 times in the
last 3 years.

new Weird development: The last 3 times I have put gas in the car (once it was
only a fill-up of about 6 gallons), it won't start. After a while it will start
and run fine.

I am puzzled, and worried about getting stuck on the road. (As example, I leave
in 2 hours to drive 300 miles to Canada to attend the GP in Montreal.)


Any thoughts? Pls reply directly to me  as well as via the list.

THANKS!
