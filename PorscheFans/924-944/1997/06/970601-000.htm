Actually the information about the S2 I gained from 911 and Porsche
World. It was an old edition featuring the new 968's and a chance to win
one for a week. The 944 S2 in question was a SE model as it had SE
decals about 12 inches high along the sides. It also featured a
non-airbag three spoke steering wheel from a 930 S. It was sold at
considerable discount to make way for the new model. The 944 turbo SE
was a UK designation for 89 and 90 turbos not as you say a turbo S. The
turbo S was just that. 70 were imported to the UK in 88 and most were
silver-rose with studio check interior. The 924-968 club runs
independent of that magazine.

a 944 S2 SE is a probably a misprint, i know after living in england
that there was a 944 Turbo SE which is a 944 turbo S. if you want to
know more then call PC-Great Britian the number is in any porshce and
911 world, they even have a special segment for 924-968 called the
924-968 club!!

As a run out model in England Porsche offered a 944 S2 SE model. It had
a "revised" computer claimed to produce 225 hp. It also had what was
described as "turbo cup" suspension. However it still had torsion bars
on the back @ 30mm diameter.

Looking in the technical specifications manual for the 944S/S2/T/TS, I
realized that the specific output of the S engine is higher than that of
the S2.  If the s.o. for the S2 was at the level of the S, the S2 should
be able to produce 227hp.  Does anybody remember from articles or
discussions
if the S2's s.o. is what it is due to low-end torque design
considerations
or was Porsche not willing to produce a NA car which had more power than
the
previous year's stock 944T (217hp)?
