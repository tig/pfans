Porschefans:

I recently bought a '92 968 cabriolet for my wife which she has really
enjoyed driving, often on the  highway with the top down.  The owners manual
says that the boot should be applied before driving on the highway to avoid
damage to the convertible top from the wind.  She therefore keep the top up
if she is in a hurry, since putting on the boot takes a few minutes, as does
removing it.

Is this really necessary?  She would be able to use the top more frequently
if the boot were optional.  Does anyone with a 944 or 968 cab have experience
with this?
