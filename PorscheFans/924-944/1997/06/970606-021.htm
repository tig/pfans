merely my .02, nothing more...

steam will clean the engine, but I'd never do it to my engine...

I recently was helping someone evaluate a 1988 944 they were contemplating,
and it was a "dealer" car that had been steam cleaned... the rubber seemed
dried out, and the aluminum parts went almost white in color...

I recently got under the hood for some semi-major maintanance, and I spent
at least as much time cleaning the engine as I did turning wrenches...

I used Simple Green, which is a non-toxic degreaser... the process is not
fun, but the results are pretty good- clean, not exactly new looking, but
clean...

to me the trick was getting gunk off the engine, and not just swishing them
around in a cleaning fashion that was actually not cleaning... I used these
newfangled "blue shop paper towels" by the Scott Paper company, the most
absorbent and tough paper towels I've ever experienced... you can use a
single paper towel for days... something like 2 rolls for $3...

I would squirt the Simple Green into the target area and then use a new
paper towel for removing as much gunky stuff as possible, then I would
repeat the process with a clean paper towel... the first paper towel would
be pretty gunky, and I would continue to use it to deal with the initial
super messy areas backing off to clean paper towels as the surface gets
cleaner and cleaner... pretty much keeping about three paper towels in
rotation from dirty/oily to pretty clean, throwing them away as they became
too dirty to use for anything, and then using the mid-level dirty paper
towels as my new super messy area cleaners, and using cleaner towels for
final wipe-ups...

the advantage in this method, is that the paper towels absorb, thus lifting
muck off the engine... another is the locality of the cleaning, no steam or
water blasting, no soap all over the place... how clean is just a matter of
how much time your willing to spend... access is an issue, so it helps to
be doing work at the same time since you have things removed...
