Personally I don't have an opinion either way but I appreciate the original
post.  If I do ever order something from this company and find myself in
the same situation, I can try to head off some of the problems the other
person had before it becomes a bigger problem.  

If the employee at this company thinks the person who made the post is
wrong, he has every right to logon to a computer and set the record
straight.  

There is a saying in the "Customer Service" world - if some has a bad
experience they will tell on the average of ten people about it, but when
they have a good one, they often don't tell anyone.
