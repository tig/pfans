Well I finally did it!! I started changing my belts since I only have
one reciept with the car stating that the belts were changed in 1989 . I
have a question to all of you that have taken on this task. I'm a little
confused about the balance belt and pulleys. I am going by a Hanes
manual which is a little vague at times, but so far so good. Do the
upper and lower pulleys have to be in time with each other?? I have not
pulled the pulleys from the shafts but I have removed the belt, the
manual as I recall didn't mention that when re-installing the balance
shaft belt that the pulleys had to be in any specific position or that I
should have marked there  relative position. Did I do something wrong
here or can I install the new belt with out a problem? I have a couple
of bad tensioner bearings and idlers which I have to replace before
going any further. Thanks in advance! I've learned a lot just reading
this "List" everyday! Keep up the good
dialog!!!
