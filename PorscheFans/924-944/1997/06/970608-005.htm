Nope. Flatspotting increases braking distances. When your tires lock you
loose traction. In the same way as when you smoke your rear tires off
the line you are not getting maximum acceleration. The only time ABS
stops you in a longer time is in gravel ( some would also argue the same
goes for snow but due to the possible presence of ice you would really
be taking your chances ). Porsche SuperCup cars have an ABS "kill
switch" but this is for when they run off into the sand traps. I recall
an interesting article  about the supercup cars. The Porsche race
director stated that because racing was so close you would see racers
turning off the ABS to try and gain an advantage. He went on to say you
would see those same racers fall off the road because nothing could pull
up those cars faster than the reprogrammed Bosch 5 system onboard.

	 Linesman? What the hell is a linesman? All Blacks have Backs,
Forwards, Loose Forwards, Tight fives, utility backs, blindsides,
opensides, full backs, inside backs, 1st fives, 2nd fives, centres,
wings, #8s, hookers, props, locks, flankers oh and half backs but no
linesmen. i think you've got the wrong sport, the only thing in this
country that involves balls and helmets is motoracing.

	In regards to m / yds / ????. When will America emerge from the dark
ages and adopt the metric system? What are you afraid of? Royals with
Cheese I suspect. Seriously I think we should try and adapt some sought
of protocol for technical topics before we have someone complaining
about rounding off nuts using a brand new 7/16 socket. Don't laugh, just
remember the first time it happened to you.

Richard
Down Under and a day ahead.

800 m / yds/ ????  Talking about flat spot meaning stoping in the
shortest distyance nope ??  You can give me in Kiwi mesures...;)
I know that should be different down under mainly if you got two big all
