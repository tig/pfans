The speed sensor closest to the rear is not so critical, but the frontal
one is.  It needs to be 7/10 of a mm (that's 0.7 mm) above the set screws
that are on the flywheel.  George B. Suggests you glue a 0.7 mm thick
spacer on the end of the speed sensor and then adjust the block until it
just makes contact.  Tighten and then remove the glued on spacer.

I used a depth gauge on mine last weekend (just finished my clutch on my
Turbo) to confirm my clearance, but I used the old dirty mark on the speed
sensor block to set it back to original height first, then checked it with
a depth gauge and compared it to the over all depth of the speed sensor.

Post Script:

If you have the third sensor on your speed sensor block, the one that is
not adjustable, it is not critical either.
