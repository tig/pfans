Good point on the ball diameter. I have not used the A-arm I rebuilt with the 
tape, that was just my first try at it. I had Dynamic Euro rebuild the Right 
A-Arm, and bought a used A-Arm for the left hand side. Your solution was to 
turn down the steel socket on a lathe so that it fits in the A-Arm, wish I had 
a lathe.. If anyone finds the correct size parts, please let us all know!
Thanks,
       Ezra
