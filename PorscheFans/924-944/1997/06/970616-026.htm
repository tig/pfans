I just had the timing and balance-shaft belts redone for the third time.
I have a 1984 944,with 95K.miles on it. I also had the waterpump
replaced and all four of the belt rollers.  I put new turbo-type motor
mounts on the car about two years ago. The car has driven like a dream
for the last few years, till now.  Now I have a strong vibration, that
really shakes the car when I rev it up to about 4,000 RPM during
shifts...My gut feeling, is that the balance-shaft belt or rollers are
out of wack...timing seems to be ok though. I called two reputable
mechanics in the Seattle area (I'm about 150 miles to the East), and
they both came to the same conclusion...'Balance-shaft area',
BTW..clutch seems ok. I mentioned this to my mechanic, who I have
trusted doing the belts twice before, and other work on the 944, as well
as my other imports.(he has a certificate...trained to work on
Porsches), and he seems to think it's somewhere else...any ideas?
I hate to go looking for anothe mechanic, I live too far away from the
dealership, but for the belts to be done right, I'll go the distance.
Iam not a Porsche mechanic(even though I have the video on how to do
this, and the Haynes manual), so I'm not the one to do it.
Anyway, anyone else had a vibration like this?
