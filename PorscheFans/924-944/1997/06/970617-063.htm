Ahem ;) Mustang GTs are a joke BTW ;) The V6 Firebirds and Camaros can
take them easily! .

If it is any consolation I have raced against and with Porsches! I have a
1977 Porsche 924, my dad has a '87 Turbo-Look Cabriolet 911, we have had
two 914s, and at least autoxed ALL of them before.  My daily driver the
'96 Formula in my .sig below, fares pretty well in comparison ;)  You would
be surprised! In a straight line VERY few Porsches can keep up. The new
turbos however are the exception! ;).  The 924 can't stand a chance in
handling but the 911 is a bit better ;). Both breeds have their
advantages.  I just got back from an Internet F-body club get together in
Memphis Tennesee and most of those cars can smoke, and I mean SMOKE even
our beloved twin turbo! They do this in under 4K dollars in modifications!
But only one car there was capable of  close to +1 G handling.  I have no clue
what he did to it though.
 
I don't mean to start a flame war

BTW I know you are going to hate this but my father and I are i nthe
process right now of creating a Nascar/Porsche car of our own.  It is
starting with a '95 Vortec V6 and the Porsche suspension etc.  Then comes
a 944 Turbo transaxle, (GMC SYCLONE/TYPHOON turbocharged parts added to our
V6), and
then a fiberglass 944 Turbo or 924 Carrera GT body.  Suspension will be
upgraded with konis,swaybars, etc.
