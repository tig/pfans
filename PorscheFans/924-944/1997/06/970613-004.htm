For fairness sake, I think that comparing a Mercedes Benz 280 with a
early 944 is making the 944 worse than it has to be. 

Before 1985.5, the 944 interior was more of a derivative of the 924 than
it was fterwards, and as interior quality goes, there is a large
difference between the early and the later model. In my comparative
studies of early and later 944's (done when I bought mine, 7 years ago)
there was a significant price difference as well as percieved 'quality'
difference between the early and the late model.

Also, the 944 (and its brethren, the 951 and 968) was set up to be
'drivers cars'. Compared to more comfort oriented cars (as the
Mercedes)the Porsche give more road feel and information about its
behaviour. This should not be misjudged as less quality, as it is more
of a design parameter. 'Safe feeling' and smoothness may therefore be
less of an objective on a sports car than on a luxury sedan, like a 6
cylinder Mercedes (wich is a very nice car).

As for 'real quality' I think that 944's are pretty trouble free. The
high prices for spare parts make the maintenance costs high, not the
amount of maintenance needed. As Mercedes's seldom are run on drivers
ed's, slaloms, solo racing... (insert your own favourite car bashing
method here!) a straight comparison is hard to make. Also, Mercedeses of
the 80:s used roller chains instead of belts to drive the camshaft, the
belt being, IMHO, the only real problem with the 944's
engine.                 

I have a 944 85.5, at 213500 km (132K miles) and I have all records
since new. During these eleven years the following had been needed in
way of repair and/or maintenance:   

4 set of brake pads - one set (Ferodo) was destroyed by the rusty discs. 
1 set of discs, back and front - front was worn, back was rusty
1 pair of shocks (originals used until very recently)
1 inner steering joint
1 water pump (at 190000 km/118 K miles)
2 cam belts (at 130000/80 K and 190000 / 118 K)
1 balance belt (at 130000/80 K)
1 engine mount at 170 000 km/105 K)

Thats about it, not counting oil, filters, windshield wipers and other
small items, nor wheel alignment checks...

The car now need one (of four) new velocity joint, and new seals on the
crankshaft front end - but still functions properly without them. In
spite of me driving it thru' the snow and rain (and salt) of Swedish
winters, there is no rust on the car.

To me, this pretty much indicates a solid car. 

For those wanting a solid 'thump' from the doors, instead of a 'clank',
Porsche will do fine...
