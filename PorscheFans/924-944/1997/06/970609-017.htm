flowmasters are too loud you can get a terminator like mine and keep the volume 
down, sounds about as deep just not as loud, when i come up there to have that 
work done you will hear it.  total cost of muffler, 4.5 inch tip (probably 
should have got smaller because of the weight), and removal and install was 
about 150$ if i remeber correctly.
