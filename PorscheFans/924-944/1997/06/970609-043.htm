The original poster wasn't "attacking" anyone, he was simply expressing his
complete and utter frustration at being misled as to the status and pricing
of a much-needed parts order. IMHO, that kind of post is most certainly not
out of line in this forum. All the guy wanted was his parts on the promised
date at the promised price, neither of which he received.

Would any of us call that anything but bad service?
