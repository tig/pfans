	Yeah, that's about right for all that work. It's not an easy
	job by any means and you don't want someone to rush the job of
	replacing and then tensioning those belts. Bad things can happen
	if they do. Porsches are expensive to work on. You gotta bite the
	bullit and take care of them properly or they can really bite you
	back. Another alternative you might think about is buying the
	factory manuals and leanring how to do the work yourself. It *is*
	possible. Good luck!
