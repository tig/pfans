As a former 914 and now 944 owner I would like to leave the following
remarks when comparing the cars:

914 virtues: Light (LIGHT!). Cheap and pretty available engine
(basically a 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 bus (type 4) engine, with some Porsche
mod's, mostly on heads. Can (and must!) be tweaked, but there are a lot
of unexpensive parts available. Uses 915 gearbox (porsche 5 speed) with
good gear ratio changes. Very good balance, extremely 'chuckable' (low
polar momentum). 

Weaknesses: Need a lot of work with the chassis because of two reasons.
To begin with, it is not overly strong so even a fresh car need
reinforcements, especially in the aft region. Then, built by Karmann,
with almost no corrosion protection it will rust, copiously! Structural
integrity may be very questionable, as soon as rust has got its grip.   
 
944 virtues: A more civilized and usable daily driver, a good (to
excellent) engine, very good balance and basically a 'good' car to
drive. IMHO, a better chassi, and *much* better engine, than the 914 in
basic form.    

Weaknesses: Expensive and complicated to tweak and tune. May need as
much work as a 914 in way of reinforcements, but mostly in the front
part of the car.      

Advice: Get the best of both worlds, buy a prepared, but cheap 914 and
drive a 944 in the weeks.

If you are going to have just one of them, go for the 944. It is much
more usable in daily driving, and can be raced (uncompetetively) in
basic shape. Remember that the oldest 944 still is 10 years newer than
any 914, and is a much better car both in components and integrity. Any
914 will need a lot of work before it is in the same shape (or as safe)
as any 944.
