Thanks for all the replies, I successfully (with the help of two of my
friends) installed the turbo-style nose conversion on my car this past
sunday and monday. It took about eight hours total (4 each day) and that
includes the installation of the turn signals (I can't believe how expensive
the front lights are for the 951 nose). I emailed Performance Products
(www.performanceproducts.com) prior to attempting the installation, cause I
wondered if they had an instruction manual of some sort. Their reply was
that they suggested a "PROFESSIONAL" body shop install it (what they have
some secret way of putting on bolts?) and that they didn't have an
instruction book. I have to say (I know I'm not being modest), but our
installation has tighter lines than any of the ones I've seen in mags, and
those were done by "professionals." (ex. excellence May issue (I think).
Well thanks again, oh yeah and if anyone else is here in Southern
California, take your car to Dwain Dement at Vision Motorsports, he kicks a**.
OH yeah, I'll post a picture of my car as soon as it gets painted (I'm
dropping it off this Friday). And by the way. the nose was made by A.I.R.
