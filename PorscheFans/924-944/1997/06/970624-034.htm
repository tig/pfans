All,

I posted weeks ago about a stalling, sometimes not starting problem I though
was the DME wiring harness.  I had the harness rebuilt, and was still having
the problem.  I could tap on the DME and the stalled engine would pick back
up or would start.  My mechanic sent the DME to Bosch to have it tested and
this is the message I just got from him:

 Bosh will not be able to test your ECU.  It is apparently a
"hybrid" unit or a "semi-gray market" unit.  I do not understand this,
but I called them with your part# before sending it.  They also
indicated that the performance chip could very well be causing your
intermittent drivability problem. 

It seems obvious that they would attribute the problem to the chip.  Has
anyone ever heard of a "hybrid " or "semi-grey market" unit?
