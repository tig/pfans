Help.

I noticed one of the 12-point bolts which hold the driver's side door brake
(the gizmo which keeps the door from opening too far) to the body was a
little loose, causing the door brake to pivot on the other bolt and click
every time the door was opened.

As I started to tighten the loose bolt, it easily turned a few degrees and
then with a little "crack" spun free, like maybe a captive nut on the other
side of the jamb broke free.  I assume there is a nut back there which was
tack-welded on at the factory and the weld is what I heard crack.

Can someone tell me how to get access to the back side of the jamb to fix
the thing? I'm afraid if it keeps pivoting on the other bolt it too will
become loose and then I'll have a sloppy mess on my hands.

TIA,

Doug
