IMO, a slight whining sound from the gearbox may not be a big problem.
It all depends if the sound is from a bearing or if its from slightly
worn gear wheels. A wheel bearing will make a more 'rumbling' sound, and
it is proportional to road speed alone. It may also change when loading
the bearing(s) sideways, i. e. making a brisk turn...

A gear whining sound may almost certainly change depending on load, like
if the engine drives the car or if the road wheel drives the gearbox, so
to say.                   

A gearbox problem may (will!) be expensive, so make sure that the reason
for putting the car up for sale is not a expensive gearbox
rebuild.       
A wheel bearing (or preferably two) is something completely different,
and if that is necessary, it is only a question of adjusting the
selling/buying price accordingly.

Mine is about the same mileage as your proposed, and it is showing its
age and miles a little, but generally it is in good shape. I would rate
the Porsche 944's in the same quality ballpark as Mercedes, better than
BMW and Volvo. Maintenance and insurance are expensive but damage
repairs are horrendously expensive, so don't skimp on preventive
maintenance...

Good luck with your descision - if this one isn't what you hope, there
are many more out there, a lot with lower mileage.
