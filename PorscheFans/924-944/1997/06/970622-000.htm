I have an `86 944T that I have owned for a short time.  Since my
acquisition, I have done everything to tune it up so that it may run
at its very best.  However, there is one small matter I have yet to
accomplish fixing, and it isn't because I haven't tried: at around
60mph, the steering wheel begins to shake rather violently
side-to-side.  It seems to come and go, but for the most part it's
constant and uniform (the degree of shaking).  The shaking occurs
regardless of acceleration or braking.  I have installed brand new
brake rotors and pads, and have had an alignment and tire balancing
service done to no avail.  Do any of you good people have any idea
what might be wrong?  

All comments welcome and appreciated, thanks.
