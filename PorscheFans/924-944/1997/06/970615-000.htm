Yes the pulleys are marked, they have alittle dash mark on them that line
up on a dash mark on the front housing, which lines up with the little dash
mark on the flywheel which lines up with the dash mark on the crank shaft
pulley etc. Hope that helps, it should say something about it in the manual.
