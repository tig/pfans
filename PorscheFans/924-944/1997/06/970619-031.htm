Hmm.. Try www.autoatlanta.com, www.performanceproducts.com, www.tweeks.com
and www.automotion.com!

Very common problem, and it happened on my '81 924 as well. It is caused by
a loose gear in the speedometer. Easily fixed, though I didn't know it at
the time..

Jumps, like "flip flap flip flap", or does it just float? Mine floats when I
do hard turns.

No need to weld, just cover the whole thing with polyurethane. I did on
mine, and it stopped all leaks.

The nearest Audi dealer! These are used on most (old) Audi and VW cars.

Hmm.. Racing headers.. Do they help?

You could put 944 ones on.. But I don't know how easy it is.

If you are looking for cheap parts, I don't think the turbo is the right
car.. As for the stiff steering, was there any difference between the width
of the wheels on your car and the turbo?

>Anything else I should know about with these cars?

Lots of minor and annoying errors after 16 years, and they accumulate weird
noises. Otherwise, they are great!

Hmm.. How do you know you need a new solenoid? What is your problem?
