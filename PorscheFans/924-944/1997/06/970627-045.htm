Well, I am a bit embarrased.  I panicked.  When the hose came off the
first time, I must of lost damn near all my coolant. I guess I didn't
have enough coolant in the system when I went back and filled the
expansion tank the first time, and the engine got hot because of that. 
When I went back the the car again, the expansion tank was empty, so I
filled it again, then again.  Now the temp is where it's suppose to be
and the fan kicks in.  

I guess this is pretty funny to everyone reading, but I'm not a techie,
so I guess I have to learn the hard way.  But the fan thing does puzzle
me.  Will the fan not kick on if there is too little coolant in the
system?   

I hope this is the end of this little experience.  But look, I ran
straight to this list for help at the drop of a hat.  That tells you
something, that this is a great list, and can be a great help to someone
in need.
