I've used my 1987 944S as my  daily driver since last August.  I've got two
problems. My commute is only about 5 kilometers and I often find myself
driving an extra 20 or so on the way home because it's so much fun. The
real problem is because I need to get to work I can't afford to be without
my car. This means if something goes wrong I have to pay to get it fixed
because I can't wait until I have time to do it myself. This can be very
expensive. Make sure you get your car checked out before you buy it.

P.S. If you live where it snows budget for 4 snow tires. These cars are
useless on all season radials in the snow.
