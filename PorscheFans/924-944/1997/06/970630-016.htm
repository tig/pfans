     I have a similar problem on my S2. In my case the noise diminishes 
     after a few miles driving.  Things suggested so far by the list are:
     
     -loose shock absorber bolts 
     -loose rear brake pads
     -loose hatch
     -loose jack/tools
     -loose exhaust
     
     I've checked all these on my car, but found nothing wrong.
     
     Yesterday I was under the car again and found some lateral play in the 
     drive shafts.  I took one shaft off to investigate, and found that the 
     output shaft from the differential moved in and out by a mm or so, and 
     clunked as it did.
     
     Is this the problem, I wonder (the retaining screw in the flange 
     centre was tight by the way)? 
     
     
     Mike
