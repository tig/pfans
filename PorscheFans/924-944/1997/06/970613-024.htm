My '86 944 has > 230,000 miles on it, I bought it last fall. The PO overheated 
the engine after a botched coolant pump replacement at ~190k miles, and had 
the engine replaced with one from an '87. To my knowledge, the transmission is 
still original. I have spent ~$1,500 in parts during the first 6 months of 
ownership. I have replaced all of the rubber seals on the engine except for 
the rear main shaft seal(leaks slightly, but will have to wait for a clutch 
job), and the seals on the oil pickup tubes. I also replaced most of the wear 
items in the front end: ball joints, bearings, tie rod ends, rotors, pads, 
tires,etc.. Misc small items have also needed replacement, clutch master 
cylinder, speakers, etc... The paint has many small stone chips in the front, 
several small dings. Overall, for a ten year old vehicle, it has survived 
well, and still drives better than any other vehicle I have owned or driven. I 
also experience the infamous drive-train vibration in the 3,000 RPM range.

Your fellow Porsche addict,
                           Ezra
