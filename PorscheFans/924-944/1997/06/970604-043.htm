There has been lots of talk recently about highway police. Some comments
seem to centre around salary and the resulting attitudes toward the cars
we drive. I can speak from a Canadian perspective.

I too have been exposed to some of the experiences that have been
described while visiting the States. The attitude displayed by American
Highway patrol is different than what I am used to, likely due to a
multitude of reasons. Maybe salary is one of them. Here, RCMP mounties
who patrol all provinces' highways but Ontario and Quebec now must be
university graduates and they are paid as such. In my experience they
have all been extremely professional and generally displayed reasonable
people skills. When I have been stopped, they were respectful of both me
and my highly capable car. I did receive tickets in 2 of 3 cases
(rightly according to the law even though safety was not jeopardized).
One was very interested in the car I had just imported from the States
as he was thinking of doing so himself. Another just down the coast, I
understand, drives a 951 daily. 

Also, it seems to me that some American Highway Police/law makers have
lost perspective of their purpose, that is to keep highways safe by
ensuring safe practices are practiced. There seems to be a focus on
speed limits the associated tax generation opportunities. It seems, at
times, that some American highway travel has turned into a cat and mouse
game aided by electronic warfare. 

I am worried that this is beginning to happen in Canada too. (Ontario ?)
