FR: Rick (87 924S)

Are there any fellow members that live in Ohio?  If so, can you
recommend an experienced mechanic that charges reasonable rates?  Will
travel 200 miles in any direction from Cambridge, Ohio for his/her
services!

I have tried at least half a dozen porsche mechanics (dealer shops) that
want to retire on just the money from my modest maintenance requests. 
OK, most of these guys want around $50/hr which seems to be the going
rate.  However, everybody wants to take around 7 to 8 hours to replace
my cam/balancing belts and replace my water pump.  Has anybody paid $400
just in labor for this work?  Is this the going rate?  All six of these
guys want $800.00 (+/-) for
.
