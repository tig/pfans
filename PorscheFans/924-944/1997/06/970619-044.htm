The normal high oil level on a 944 will make the oil level to be
slightly over one of the the front seals hidden behind the belt pulley,
and the belt covers. Incidently, when the oil level is about 1/2 down
the dipstick, this particular seal is no longer wetted by oil. If oil
leaks out this way, it will collect on the gravel shield (wich easily
can hold 1/3 of a qt, due to its shape). When you drive briskly, the oil
will dump, but probably not on your driveway on your garage floor...   

See if the oil still leak when at the lower part of the dipstick. That
would give you a clu if there really is a leak... 

And for those wondering how anybody can dream up a story like this -
DONT ASK! I'll take care of the seal at next cam belt change...

Regards !
