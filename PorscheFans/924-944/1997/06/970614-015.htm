Nology appears to be a takeoff of the word knowledge.  Maybe in concept b=
ut
not in manufacturing.

If you spend a fair chunk of change (ok, $120) for a set of state of the
art spark plug wires, it would seem reasonable to expect  a degree of
quality control.  When we installed or attempted to install the new set o=
f
Nology plug wires on my 951 2.9 stroker, two of the wires would not snap
onto the plugs.  The offending wires were removed from the engine and we
attempted to snap them on to loose plugs.  Once again, they would not sna=
p
on.  A measurement with calipers showed the connectors were set too deep =
in
the holders.  To get the plugs to snap in, we had to remove the Behr rubb=
er
boots which pulled right off because they  were just stuck on with silico=
ne
seal. =


A call to the Nology factory was met with the comment that we were not
installing the wires correctly.  If I was doing the installation, maybe,
but my engine builder, no way.  My next call to Nology puts me in contact=

with one of the owners who indicates if I bring the wires by, they would
fix them.  I figure now I am on the right track, the head honcho would ha=
ve
the problem solved in no time.  I take the wires and my 951 head to Nolog=
y
and the honcho I talked to is not in.  =


I should of suspected something when I was turned over to an assistant wh=
o
did not have a German accent.  However, he nodded knowingly when I showed=

him how the wires would not snap on a plug much less snap on a plug in th=
e
head.  He took the wires and promised a speedy rework.  The next day I
receive a call from the assistant.  He asks for a measurement of the OEM
plug wire.  A call to my builder is met with; "Don't those people have
manufacturing specifications?", "The measurement of the top portion of an=
y
plug is the same." and "Building plug wires is not rocket science.".   He=

does however talk to the assistant and gives him the requested informatio=
n.

The reworked plug wires arrive after a week of phone calls but still do
snap on correctly.  However, Nology is improving, this time only one wire=

is bad.  The not-so-able-bodied assistant insists that the reworked wires=

went through QC before they were shipped.  I indicate that I am about rea=
dy
to toast Nology's butt on the Internet and suddenly he has an attitude
adjustment.  He will personally drive out a new set of wires and install
them himself.  My parting words to him are, "Did you measure the
replacement wires yourself?"

The assistant arrives at my builder's shop and attempts to install the ne=
w
wires.  Once again one wire will not snap on.  The assistant distroys the=

wire trying to get it to snap.  He offers us a full refund which my build=
er
refuses.  The Nology man indicates that they have the connectors made by =
a
subcontractor and are having problems.  My builder pulls a set of Rajah
connectors off his shelf and shows the "engineer" that each of those
connectors fits perfectly and have been on the market for 20 years.  My
builder suggests they change connector sources.  =


The Nology man agrees to fix the defective wire and bring it back the nex=
t
day.  Before he leaves, my builder mentions that the rubber boots are
pulling off.  Mr. Nology indicates that they are using the best silicone
adhesive available.  My builder tells him they are using the wrong adhesi=
ve
and pulls a can off his shelf and shows him what they should be using.  M=
y
builder also shows him the old OEM boots and several other wires with
rubber boots in his shop.  None of them pull off.

After three days and two phone calls, the wire is finally returned reglue=
d
with silicone.  It finally snaps on so my builder says screw it, he will
glue the boots on himself.

Tolal time wasted was two and one half weeks.  Numerous phone calls, fals=
e
promises and shoddy workmanship made this a purchase we could of lived
without.

Usual disclaimer for dealing with clowns, I have no finanical interest
(thank God).

Jim Richmond

87 951 2.9, finally wired

1/2 89 S2, will not use Nology wires unless they get rid of the bugs and
give us a free set for our trouble         =
