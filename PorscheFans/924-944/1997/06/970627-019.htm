Khalid-

The version with all the Porsche tweeks was never in the US, but the turbo
motor is essentially the same as found in current Audi S4's, the sport sedan
based on the 100/200 platform.  There are some around in wrecking yards, I
even looked into putting one into my Coupe Quattro in hopes of making it
into Audi's version of the S2, but the motors are pretty steep in the
neighborhood of 6K US funds!  These engines are easily tweeked, as Porsche
did, to produce 300hp.  

Now about fitting it into the 944....well I believe it will clear all the
necessary walls in the engine bay, but the problem you'll have is the
tranny.  The gearbox on that engine is bolted to the block, while the 944
tranny is in of the rear transaxle, hence the name.  That would be some
pretty trick engineering to get all to work together.  You'r prolly better
off getting a 951 engine and doing a transplant if that is what you want.
As the rest of the list will tell you, it is far more cost effective to just
buy a nice 951 and tweek it rather than a build your own.

HTH,
Riff

ps:  If you do happen to undertake the project, let me know.
