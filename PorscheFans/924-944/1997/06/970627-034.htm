Hey Peter,

Hood strut replacement, while difficult, is not impossible. Also, have a
friend available.  I'll explain later.

Remove the struts by first: propping up the hood; using a big screw
driver and prying the side attached to the engine compartment off.  It
is a ball and socket joint and should pop off.  Be careful not to
scratch the paint.  I use a small piece of wood as a wedge.  Next remove
the clevis pin on the hood side of the strut.  Repeat for the other
side.

To install the new one I attach the side to the engine compartment
first.  (I find this easier than starting with the hood side.) Just pop
the strut onto the ball connection.  It will lock in place with a loud
snap.

Now comes the difficult part.  The new strut is not easy to compress but
you need to compress the strut slightly while guiding it to the mounting
point on the hood.  This is where it's good to have a friend hold the
hood up as far as it will go.  Once you have the strut lined up with
hood mounting point, you can relieve the pressure. You may have to use a
small phillips screw driver to line up the holes. After the holes are
lined up, put some grease on the pin, clip on the clevis and repeat for
the other side.  I have only performed this fix twice.  Maybe someone
else has an easier way to perform this task.  All I can say is it worked
for me.  Hope this helps.
