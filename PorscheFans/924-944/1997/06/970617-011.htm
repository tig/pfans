Well, my engine reinstall got delayed a week due to rain and lack of 
a friend to help drop the engine on my head.  I definitely foresee a 
problem, though, because I did not mark the wiring harness when I took 
it out.  If any of you are going to be around this Saturday and 
wouldn't mind helping out, I would certainly appreciate it if you 
wouldn't mind a couple of phone calls to ask where wires go. 

BTW, I read the Haynes AFTER I took the thing out.  It says to "make 
sure you mark the wires as you will not know where they came from" or 
something like that.  Lesson learned.

Email me directly if you could help.  Thanks!

Dave
