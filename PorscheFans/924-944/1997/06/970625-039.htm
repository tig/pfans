We had this discussion a few weeks back.  The consensus is that no one
knows why the system does this.  There are a few theories people have
tossed around that I've compiled.

I am going to make some assumptions that I've made known before I go
into the theories that people and myself had.  I am assuming that
the cycling valve is always showing the wastegate diaphragm the vacuum
line pressure.  When the desired boost level is higher than the wastgate
spring of 0.2bar, the cycling valve opens and vents some of the vacuum
line pressure back into the intake (or wherever) and allows for the
wastegate to see less pressure, therefore closing again and allowing
more boost to buildup.  Essentially, the cycling valve is an electronic
bleeder.  I'd prefer for the system to work the other way (leaks the
air, then when the boost level is reached, open the valve to allow the
wastegate to see the pressure).  The second way I've mentioned gives
less lag and more of a hit when the boost comes on, but is dangerous
if the valve sticks.  With all the cool technology in this car, maybe
the cycling valve has two valves, one that controls how much is bled
off and one that controls how much the wastegate sees, I wouldn't
put it past these German engineers!  Anyone know for sure?

Anyhow, the theories are that enough current is not being given at
part throttle to open the valve to allow bleeding of the air.  I don't
buy this theory because the valve is likely an on/off type of valve that
is powered on and off to maintain a certain valve openness.  I doubt
it can be controlled with different current levels.

My theory is that it is designed that way.  A magazine I was reading
said that the car had an unusual throttle response, mild and sufficient
around town and then afterburners when the throttle went from 98%
to 100%.  They said 95% of the acceleration came when the pedal went
to 98%.  This sure sounds like what we do.  Maybe there was some
emissions reason for this setup.

Another fellow said that it was his throttle cable not opening the throttle
enough at part throttle.  An adjustment apparently cured the part throttle
problem.  I tried this on Paul's car (he has that annoying 0.2bar part
throttle condition) and it didn't do anything.

The only fix that I know of is to drill the cycling valve.  This allows
for a constant bleed and allows almost any boost pressure to be maintained
at part throttle.  This is what I have.  There are problems with this
system too.  If knock is detected, the KLR will tell the DME to reduce
the timing and increase fuel, if knock still persists, the KLR will
instruct the cycling valve to show more pressure to the wastegate.
This would effectively reduce the boost in a normal boost bolt car,
but in a drilled cycling valve car, there is nothing the cycling valve
can do.  By opening more, it may be able to drop the boost a pound or
two, but it doesn't have the range that the normal cycling valve has
(0.2bar to 1.0bar).  An easy test to see this actually happen is to 
pull the electrical connection from the cycling valve.  The boost should
drop to 0.2bar (1.2bar on the gauge).  On my car, disconnecting the
electrical connection results in almost the same boost as when plugged
in (0.8bar 1.8bar on the gauge).  Connected, it's 1.0bar or 2.0bar on
the gauge.

Hope that helps someone.  Paul doesn't mind the 0.2bar/1.0bar transition
since it makes him go faster in auto-x and track days, wide open or nothing!
