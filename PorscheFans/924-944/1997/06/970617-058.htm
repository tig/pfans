First off, 944 cars don't run hot when everything is right with them, and it's 
not hard to get everything right.  Yes, do change your coolant once a year and 
everything, esp. the radiator, will last a lot longer.

You don't want to run the engine below 180F.  Oil works best in the 180 - 220 
F range, and you should shoot for operating in that range.

With respect to your fans, is the low speed fan not coming on, or is it the 
high speed fan?  On an 87, I believe you have the three-pin radiator fan 
switch vs. the earlier two-pin design.  If one of the fans never operates, 
this switch is almost always the culprit.  If your car runs in the right 
temperature range at speed (vs. in traffic), chances are your thermostat is 
fine.

Subject:	'87 944 temp rises when stopped in traffic

        Dear 944 Owners:

  I bought this 1987 944 4 months ago, put 4500 miles on it in Maryland, and 
now that the weather is getting hotter, I notice the car is running hotter
when I bring it down from highway speeds, to a dead stop (like in a traffic
jam). The temperature rises dramatically in a matter of several minutes.

I checked to see if the fan was running when idling , and it was -- but only
ONE fan comes on.  Even when I stopped the car -- only one of the two fans
ever come on -- IS THIS ABNORMAL???   I mean where are there two fans , If
I only see one ever work???

I could put in a lower temparature themostat (but the 180 for the state of
MD should be OK), I could also buy a lower temp fan switch from the 
Performance
catalog I have been getting.  Or do you recommend a coolant flush??? The car 
only has 69,000 miles on it (taken care of the first 8 years of its life OK,
but can't exactly say that for the last two years by owner #3, I am onwer #4)

I have read in past issues of Excellence Magazine that the 944 runs hot and
that they recommend a coolant flush?? (it has been so long since I read that
article, am I remembering things correctly??)

                                Any insights would be appreciated,

                                David Johnston
                                1987 Porsche 944
                                69,000 miles
