I know they were in Atlanta but I can't remember their name.  The local
shop that re-built the head for me crated it up and sent it up there for me
(I'm in south FL) so I don't have a bill from the place that actually did
the boring.  I'm sure my local shop would remember.  I'll try to remember
to ask them.
