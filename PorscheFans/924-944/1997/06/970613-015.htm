Well, this is my first time on the list and I have a question that I 
hope
can be answered.

If I want to respond to someone's message, what is the best way?
I'm using Outlook from Office97.

I've have just "received" my first Porsche... My father past away in 
Feb
and he left me his Porsche. It's a 1989 944 Turbo S and this car was
everything to him. This car had all options, Guards red, black 
leather
interior, oil changed every 3K miles. My father bought this car new 
and
it only has 42K miles on it now (you can probably guess that my father 
was single). I've always wanted a Porsche and the 993 Twin was my
favorite. But now I look at this car and see what everyone sees. 
These
cars are beautiful. What gorgeous fenders and body lines. I was able 
to
drive the car a couple of times before the reg expired (we only now 
have
Power of Attorney so that we can get the car registered into my name)
and the driving experience was fantastic!!! I'm hooked!!! Now all I do 
is
eat and sleep Porsche. I'm getting married in August and hopefully 
it's
not in jeopardy now :) Does anyone else find themselves sitting in 
their car
at night listening to the radio and smelling the fine leather??? 
Hopefully it's
not just me... anywhere I can go for help??? Or is it too late for 
me???

Anyway, if anybody out there want's (or needs) to talk Porsche, I can
be reached at dtully@slip.net. By the way, this listing in fantastic 
and
having the Archives available is also fantastic....

TIA,
Darin Tully
