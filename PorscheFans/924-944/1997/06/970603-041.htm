< Could you explain the procedure to remove the door panel?  Thanks!>

Ok.  First, remove the four screws that hold the door speaker in.  Watch =
out not to lose the four black plastic spacers around each screw.  Pull =
out the speaker and detach the harness.  The wires are different sizes =
(at least on mine) so don't worry about getting the phase (+,-) mixed =
up. Remove the two screws in the bottom of the window switch plate.  The =
plate has a clip that holds it to the door panel, so slide it down to =
get it off.  Use a small screwdriver to push the pins in on the side of =
each switch, releasing it from the switch plate.  (If your window =
switches are intermittent, or not working, they can be opened up and the =
contacts cleaned to solve that problem, but good luck getting the ball =
bearing back in the switch).  Next remove the two screws you will find =
under the door armrest.  These are deep in the armrest, so you have to =
move your screwdriver around in there until you find the screwhead.   =
Next pull the door handle back to expose the screw head there and remove =
the screw. You can lift the surrounding plastic cover out, but the =
handle itself will not be removed.  Next remove the screws all along the =
bottom of the door 'pocket'.  Watch for spacers and those little screw =
head covers, if you still have them.  Note that the screw on the forward =
edge of the pocket is not screwed into the door, but into a bracket, =
which is screwed into the door.  The pocket has two plastic pegs that =
hold it to the armrest, so pull the pocket down to remove it.  Remove =
the screw holding the small black bracket at the forward edge of the =
door panel.  Get a flat tool, the flatter the better (example: large =
flathead screwdriver or putty knife) and use it to remove the =
compression clips that hold the panel along the sides and bottom.  Be =
careful about the paint.  You find them by trial and error, sliding the =
tool behind the panel and prying out.  They are spaced 5 or 6 inches =
apart.  Pop all those away from the door.  The door is hooked over the =
top edge of the door frame and by a central metal hook thingy.  Take the =
panel off by sliding the panel up, not out.  Look behind as soon as you =
can, before the panel is all the way off, and note the central metal =
hook that sticks out of the panel and slides into the door frame.  That =
will be important when reassembling.  There you go.  Put it back in =
order by reversing the steps.  The screws under the armrest are tough to =
get back in.  You will almost certainly need to magnetize your =
screwdriver to get them to stay on while you blindly feel for the screw =
hole. Hope this helps.
