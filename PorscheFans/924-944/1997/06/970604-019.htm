Hi All,
	I recently did a track event, and the next day I was driving on the
freeway and at steady throtle doing about 80mph the car would suddenly
start to slow down, as if the fuel pump stopped working, It wasn't 
missing,
it just didn't care what the gas pedal was doing. It procedded to do 
this a
few more times.  It would last for 1 or 2 seconds at the longest. It 
did it
around 12 times in a relatively close time span. It did not do it for 
the
rest of the drive which was about 15 miles. Has anyone had this problem
before? My car is an 86 951 with 50k miles on it.  I recently replaced 
the
fuel filter and everything is fine in regards to that.  Thanks in 
advance.
-Paul Todd
