Two possible causes I can think of, both of which I have experienced:

1. The sunroof microswitch between the visors and/or the "radio relay" 
(next to heater controls on a clip, driver's side footwell) are bad. This 
will send rapidly changing information to the relays next to the motor in 
the left-side rear compartment. This should also make your sunroof behave 
strangely, although it may not react at all depending on the position of 
the 2 micro-switches in the rear compartment. In my car this problem 
manifested itself by making completely random clicks between 0 and 20 mph 
while the sunroof's safety features were trying to kick in. Solution: try 
disabling the sunroof (remove fuse) and see if the clicks go away. If yes 
replace the radio relay and/or the roof microswitch.

2. Bad cruise control brain. This made the cruise control servo click and 
tug at the throttle cable between 0 and 30 mph, rythmically. Solution: 
unplug the CC brain and see if the clicks disappear. If yes, replace the 
brain or try to run through the circuit board with an oscilloscope like 
I've been doing for the last 6 months and let us know when you find the 
defective piece of sand!
