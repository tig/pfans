You can do one of two things.  1 is to replace it when emissions time comes
around or 2 is to leave the test pipe on and see if it passes.  In our area
here, the car, I'm sure, will pass with flying colors even with no cat-con.
The only part it will fail is the visual inspection.  I believe in enjoying
our cars to their fullest, but at the same time, we should take some
responsibility for our actions against our world (no, I'm not a tree
hugger).  I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world and
would like to keep it that way, you begin to really miss the mountain
views when it gets smoggy and they return when a cold night pops in now
and then during the summer.  Running a 944 Turbo without a cat should not
be excessive in any way I would think.  My RICH as heck Talon passed all
emissions tests without a hitch with no cat.
