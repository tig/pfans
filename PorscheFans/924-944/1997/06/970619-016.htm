Bruce,

I suspect you may be losing boost at 11 psi/4000 rpm due to the boost limit
switch cutting out.  I have a 1-bar wastegate spring installed and my boost
will climb to 14 psi and stay there up to about 4000 rpm under WOT and then
WHAM, the boost cut-out switch triggers and everything goes to zero.  I think
the factory switch is set to cut out at 14 psi or thereabouts.  Your boost
gauge may be off by a couple of psi, they're not that accurate.  The cutout
switches are probably not all identical either.  Anyway, try grounding your
cutout switch connection and try her again.  Then, remember to put the cutout
wire back where it belongs.  Wastegates do fail.

I think you have a non-factory fitting on your boost control line.  My 1980
931 has no such ball valve.  This control line goes to the wastegate plenum
which pushes the wastegate exhaust valve open when the boost pressure in the
duct is at the prescribed maximum.  The wastegate spring is what determines the
pressure at which the wastegate opens.  The factory spring is around 11 psi,
when new.  Mine was wasting at around 7-8 psi when I finally rebuilt the
wastegate using the 1-bar (14.7 psi) spring.
