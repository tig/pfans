Hey Guys

You might already received my last MSG to the very congenital gentleman
whose e-mail is KDS944T@aol.com, same guy screaming witch hunting in
regards of Ron @ Eurospeed. Basicaly, this nice guy ( a lot of sarcarsm
here !! ) has a really narrow, no clue, low life mind to send me a msg
to proofread my posts before sending. One of the things oin this list
that I like it, is the help and advise we give each other no matter of
nationality, language or belief. =


The guys from Germany, sweeden, Canada, Qu=E9bec and etc.. write on this
forum, making sometimes some errors but we're not here to judge it. If
it's hard to understand, just write back and try to figure out. =

We get toghther here for the love of Porsches, and we own them for the
same reason not to flash it !!!

I've answer this guy on the only way he deserved and I appologized to
you all if it was explicit... Believe me I would say some other things
about it but I've done public to expose it. =


Sorry for the " mac - believer" for mentioning your system, I'm a Unix
user, and for the Yugo owners... ( naaaaaa... ) anyway, I waste a lot of
BW already with this issue, and I know that those who voiced already
their opinions on this matter will understand. =


Time to go and drive to Qu=E9bec, see the race, listen to Le Mans and see=

the GT1 kick some but ....

Take care all =
