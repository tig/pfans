I refrained from replying to the original thread because I assumed anyone
who has had bolts backout would use loctite.  But double shame if this
happened twice and it wasn't used.  Some people do not realize that the
bolt threads and the threads in the hole need to be "spotless" - free from
any type of grease or oil.  The best way to ensure the loctite will work is
to spray all threads with brake parts cleaner prior to using loctite.  I've
never had a bolt work its way loose after using this method.  Also,
remember that there are different "grades" of loctite.  Some bolts can't be
removed without heat if you use one of the higher "grades" - Make sure you
read the package explaining what those numbers (grades) mean.  Good Luck!
