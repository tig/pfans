Two things it could be: (1) the hatch glass tends to come un-glued and makes
an ungodly racket. They can be reglued by a competent glass shop. The hatch
must be removed to do it; (2) the rear brake pads will rattle if the pads
are aftermarket pads, especially Metal Masters. Test this by driving down a
bumpy road. If the rattling stops when you gently apply the brakes, its the
pads.

Significant performance gains. I put a chip in my car at about 35,000 miles.
It now has 106,000 miles and the chip hasn't caused any problems yet.
