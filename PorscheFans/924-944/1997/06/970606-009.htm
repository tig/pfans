Oliver,

When I drove the RX-7s, I had an overwhelming sense that the car was
isolated by hundred of pounds of rubber.  There was a slight lag that
accompanied my every input -- almost as if the steering, gearbox and
driveline were each isolated by enormous amounts of rubber.  The 944 on
the other hand was a revelation.  There was a great sense of mechanical
precision in all the controls.  The car felt hewn from one piece,
whereas the Mazda felt like an assembly of many parts.  

Although you did ask for facts, I don't think this is truly possible
when comparing cars.  A great car evokes an emotional bond between
itself and the driver.  Raw test data can't describe this connection,
nor can it quantify the tactile differences of which I spoke above.  I
urge you to drive both as there is no better way to understand what I
mean.  

Good luck,
John
