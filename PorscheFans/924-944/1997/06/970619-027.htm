Hey dudes,

Some of my local area auto-xers have got me thinking of trading the '89 951
in for a '90 911 C2.  I have not yet driven the C2 (Monday is my test drive).
I asked about people's experiences with the C2 and haven't really gotten much
info back from people.  Mainly, the common thing is, the 951 will kill the
C2 in all aspects, corning, acceleration, etc, etc, but, the C2 has that aura
of the engine in the back and that sound.

I basically have two options:
1. Keep the 951 and upgrade it over the next 3-4 years to the point where it
   is race-ready in 3-4 years.  At that point, stick a roll cage in it and it
   becomes one of the fastest race cars around.  I would then buy a C2 Turbo
   for the street (I should have enough money by then to get the Turbo model
   instead of the NA model).
2. Trade the 951 in for a C2 NA right now.  I would need to do some work to the
   C2 to bring it up to the level that I'd want, which is mainly an 3.8 RS-R style
   wing, front lip spoiler and full suspension.  I would keep the C2 for 3-4
   years and then upgrade to the C2 Turbo.  I believe my 951 wheels transfer
   over to the C2 and the Turbo model comes with the cup wheels anyways.

What I'm getting sick and tired of is people constantly talking about how
this is not a real Porsche and how it doesn't have the right feel, etc.  I
can't really say much to these people about this since:
1. I am losing to them in auto-x.
2. I have not owned a 911, they have owned several so I don't have any experience.

Basically, the comments I keep hearing are that the 944 is one of the best cars
on the road, but it's one of the worst Porsches.  I feel this is bunk, but then
I've never owned a 911 so who knows?

If I do keep the 951, I will have to start modifying it to keep up with the
new gen cars, at least some sort of body add-ons like maybe a 968 Turbo S
wing or something and maybe some turbo cup swaybars.  

The 944 is also becoming so common around our racing circles.  We had six
944's that look identical at the last event, (Wes's S2, my T, Paul's T, Darren's
T, Patrick's T and Tim's TS).  We had one 911TT, one 993 C2 and one 89 Carrera,
no 90 C2's.

I don't know, I'm confused.  Everyone feels that my car needs some personality,
like maybe some funky turbo work to make it sound neater or something.  What's
your advice?

Keep in mind one thing, we hardly go to the big tracks so showing the real
Porsches your tailights is a harder option out here.

Farzaan.
