Well, color me educated! Your argument about reproportioning the other
brakes is very interesting. I thought the system was a lot more
simplistic and just backed off on the locked wheel thereby possibly
losing some advantage over an educated foot. I had no idea the 911 GT1
and the GT2 have ABS. I wonder if those systems were written by the same
programmer using the same sensors and algorithms though...

> ABS, and proud of it

This is *very* funny! I have a mental image of you saying that with a
strong Texas accent and I am howling!
