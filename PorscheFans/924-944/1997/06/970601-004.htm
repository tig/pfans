1. is there a correct amount of slack that the accelerator cable is
   supposed to have at idle?

Nothing specific, but there shouldn't be too much play in the cable 
between the point where it leave the sheath and wraps around the 
throttle cam.  Maybe 1 - 3 mm slack, if such is measurable.  Be careful 
to avoid too little slack or preload, because you can then damage the 
throttle at wide-open.

2. is the throttle arm the only adjustment to make in this regard

Where the cable leaves the bowden sheath, I believe your car has a 
threaded adjustment which can be used to control cable slack.

3. during a smoothe normal acceleration, I can feel very slight 
hesitation in
   engine as I accelerate, but in very hard and agressive acceleration 
I don't
   get any hesitation and my speed increases very smoothly - is this 
related
   to my cable needing some adjustment - I don't know what else could 
cause
   this, because my car behaves the same way even after a major tune up 
service

Very unlikely that it has anything to do with the cable.
