RE:     Bleeding Revisited




After following the thread on brake bleeding, there seemed to be somethin=
g
missing.  IMO one of the truly messy and frustrating jobs is bleeding
brakes by yourself.  With me, neither necessity nor war is the mother of
invention, it is laziness.  When my brakes turned to mush at the last tim=
e
trials, I knew I would have to figure out some easy way of brake bleeding=
=2E

The bleeder project was a success except for a minor mishap.  I started o=
ut
with a one gallon plastic gas can, 1/4" and 3/8" poly tubing with various=

brass compression fittings and a spare brake fluid reservoir cap.  From
what I can tell, most import caps should be the same.  Find one that has
the vent hole in the center.  Drill a hole in the center of the cap and
install a 3/8" compression fitting.  Make sure you have a good seal betwe=
en
the reservoir cap and fitting.  I had to reseal mine because the connecti=
on
leaked.  I used about 2' of tubing between the cap and can so the can cou=
ld
sit on the manifold with a nice arc to the cap. On the other end of the
tubing, install a double ended 3/8" fitting.  Drill a hole in the gas can=

cap and install the fitting through it.  Cut a length of 3/8" tubing that=

will reach the bottom of the can and install it on the fitting.  Drill a
hole in the gas can vent hole and thread in a 1/4" fitting and install a
length (I used about 6') of 1/4" tubing.  Install a male quick disconnect=

fitting to the compression fitting on the other end of the tubing.  I use=
d
o'rings and blue silicone sealant on the fittings on the cap and gas can.=
 =

My engine builder says the brake fluid will eat the silicone but so good =
so
far.

So this is what you have:  A reservoir cap running to the gas can with a
tube going to the bottom of the can.  A pressure line from your air tank
(the one you fill your tires with) attached to the gas can via a quick
disconnect.  Fill the gas can with brake fluid, screw on the fluid cap an=
d
open the air tank valve to between 5 to 10 psi.  Attach a clear brake
bleeder line with a tight 90 degree rubber elbow to the brake bleeder
valves and have at it.  You can do all four wheels without having to fill=

the reservoir or fool with pumping the pedal.

I had just replaced the brake system (master cylinder, two calipers and t=
wo
wheel cylinders) on a old P1800 Volvo that has been sitting for years. =

What  better way to test my contraption!  I screw on the cap, pressurize
the system and start bleeding the rear brake.  It works like a champ.  Se=
lf
congratulations are in order.  My visions of awards and glory are
interrupted by a spitting noise.  What is that spitting noise?  A small
lake of brake fluid appears under the car fed by the front calipers.  It
seems Mr. Inventor didn't bother to check the bleeder valves on the rebui=
lt
calipers.  My dear friends at Volvo helped me out by installing three
bleeder valves on each caliper.  I can attest to their superior function.=
 =

Six open bleeders can move a half gallon of brake fluid in a matter of
minutes.  Half a bag of oil absorbent covers up my handiwork.  A blast of=

brake cleaner through the lines and can and my new toy is ready to be tri=
ed
on the P car.  Further report to follow.........  =


Disclaimer:  Any oil spills should be reported to the EPA and blamed on
whoever started this thread.  I knew there was a reason I swore off brake=

bleeding years ago.
