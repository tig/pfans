I honestly think that by the time the 968 came out it was already
doomed.  The 968 even had a lower sticker price than the 944S2 it
replaced, at least for the coupe, and it came with a 6 speed
transmission (or Tiptronic) among other minor improvements.  Like
everyone said, thanks to the popularity of SUV's and other luxury makes,
sports cars with high insurance rates looked far less attractive every
day to the average consumer. The sports car market was on a downward
spiral which, along with the fabulous 928 and 968, took the 300ZX, RX-7
and MR2 with it.  The only one that remains is the brutally fast, but
equally ugly, Toyota Supra.  And sales for that model are mediocre at
best.  The styling issue can be debated until the cows come home.  One
man's beauty is another man's aberration.  If I had it my way, I would
have the 968 AND a 944S2 or 951.  I love the aggressive front end of the
951's and 944S2's but I also love the more modern front end of the 968
as well.

We had a 85.5 944 in the family for almost 9 years and it was a
fantastic car.  My dad traded it in on a '94 968 coupe and has not
looked back since.  I bought my own '94 968 coupe in the beginning of
the year and have not regretted it since.  It is a fantastic car which
has lived up to my every expectation and both cars have proven
bulletproof reliable.  Hopefully someday a 928GTS will join the stable
as well.  I will never forget driving down the famous Autobahn and
seeing 928's enter the road and immediately head for the left lane.
Within seconds they were but a speck in the distance.  It's a shame that
a lot of people have a narrow minded view of what a real Porsche should
be, because as great as the 911 is and will be, the 924/944/968 and the
928 series were real Porsches and in time will be regarded as such.
