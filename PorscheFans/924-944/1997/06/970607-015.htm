Chris,sway bar reduce the amount of lean a vehicle inhibits as it goes
around corners.  As a vehicle leans (rolls), the center of gravity
changes, weight is transfered, and tire contact patch is altered...all
adversely affection the handling of the car.  Ideally, for the best
suitable setup on a race car, roll is virtually eliminated...of course,
springs, shocks, bushings, tires, sway bars, etc. all differ from stock.

On a street car, a compromise as to handling/ride is what you get.  I
would venture to say that every street manufactured car (yes..even
Porsche) can be significantly made to have improved handling/braking by
the addition of a different spring/shock/sway bar setup.  Sway bars
themselves are not the total answer to a better handling car, but they
are a start.  A nice feature of installing a thicker sway bar versus
heavier shocks or springs is that the normal "ride" of the car is not
altered (meaning--stiffer/rougher).

Most factory installed bars are not adjustable.  Some, but not all
aftermarket bars are adjustable.  It is possible to modify some factory
bars and make them adjustable (ex.--early 911 front bars). Adjustments
can be accomplished by different means, but that is usually determined
by the design/manufacturing of the bar.

Some bar mounting arms (called drop links) can be shortened or
lengthened to set the preload of a bar.  The pivot position of some bars
can be changed to tighten or loosen the bar.

If you have Weltmeisters on the front of your turbo, they probably have
adjustable drop links and a slider arm attached to the bar.  Moving the
slider towards the end of the bar will in effect loosen the bar, moving
the slider in towards the inside will tighten the bar.  The same goes
for the rear.  The drop links can be adjusted to get no preload on the
bar when the car sits squarely on all four tires (meaning there is no
tension on the bar).

What do the adjustments do??  You can change the suspension setup from
understeer..to neutral...to oversteer with bar adjustment.  Although
there are many other factors to consider that can and should be used to
"tune" the suspension, the sway bars are one of the easiest to deal with
(either by adjustment or by changing to a larger or smaller size). 
Larger is not necessarily better.  That depends on other factors.  Many
times you might adjust the rear bar looser to get a better grip on the
front of your car, or vice-versa.

When we raced Toyota Supra Turbos in the Firestone Firehawk series, we
went through several different bar sizes until we found the correct
setup.  Same with our 944's in the Firehawk series.  

A good bit of advice is to pick out a car similar to yours at a club
race or autocross that is the fastest of the group and ask him what his
setup is.  

One note...if you have the big Weltmeistes, be sure and periodically
check your mounts at the front frame rail to be sure that the frame is
not cracking.
