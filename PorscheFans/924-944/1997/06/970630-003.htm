Regarding your A/C switch not staying in Ezra, I had the same problem with
mine.  My dealer told me that on the 86 951's that switch was part of a
circuit board that controlled all heating/cooling functions.  So the entire
circuit board needed to be replaced at a cost of around $700.00 just for the
board!  The service director said he would like to try a simple inexpensive
fix for me, which I gladly authorized.

1. Remove the circuit board from the dash.
2. Unsolder the defective A/C switch from the board
3. Clean up/remove any of the old solder remaining (use that suction thingie - 
   I don't know what it's called)
4. Re-solder a new A/C switch to the board - on newer 951's (maybe 88 & 89
   models, the A/C switch was not physically soldered to the circuit board
   and was designed as an easily replaced item).

I am guessing this should be the same for the NA 944's but I don't know.

Total cost:  new A/C switch for an 89 951:  $49.00
             labor charges:                 ~1 hour @ $55.00/hour

Much more reasonable than the $700.00+ first quoted to me.  You'll probably
be able to do it at a fraction of the $100.00 I paid since you already do
advanced work on your car.  Shouldn't be too difficult to find a used switch.
944 Ecology, maybe?
