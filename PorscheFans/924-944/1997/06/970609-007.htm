Wesley:

Basically the only response I  received was from a gentleman with some
impressive Porshce credentials.( Sorry I didn't remeber his name)  He
explained that there is no performance gains on any other setting, and by
keeping the dial all the way clockwise, the stock position,  is the best
manner to keep your performance levels.

I should have pursued it a bit further, seeing exactly why the factory
decided to allow manual adjustment in both fuel mixture and timing. Is it for
passing of emissions? Thats my guess. BTW I took his advise and set the dial
to stock setting. Any ideas?
