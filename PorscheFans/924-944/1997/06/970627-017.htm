Since I'm getting alot of feedback on this, I'll post some more info about my
car which I forgot to post yesterday.

The scales I measured the car at where used at the PCA club race at Brainerd
last weekend.  I'm pretty sure they were accurate.

Probably the biggest weight savings done to my car has been the replacing of
the stock hood with a fiberglass hood.  I don't know if you can do this in
stock classes for club racing.  The hood looks exactly like the stock one (I
think it uses the same frame-work underneath, however has a thin easily dimpled
sheet of fiberglass over it.

I also have andial's 2.8 l conversion which may save some pounds. ??

I don't have a roll-cage or any sound deadening material in the passenger and
driver side seat wells.  I also don't have the top part of my rear seat in.

Hope this helps.
