Hello P fans,

I am humblely asking for guidence on a problem that has me baffeld.  

The victim:  1982 924 NA

The symptom:  I have a wierd starting problem that I think was addressed on
this group when I just started reading.  

Dead cold in the morning it starts, fast idle, then settles down just
wonderful.  I then drive it to the gym to work out and after sitting for
about 1 1/2 hours, it will do one of two things, if it starts right up, it
runs like it is loaded up or just running on 3 cylinders, after revving it a
little it clears up.  If it  doesn't start, it will take 4 - 5 tries to get
it running, then the previous scenereo occours again.  But sometimes, it
just starts fine.

Someone posted something about a check valve in the fuel pump circut not
holding pressure thus allowing vaporlocks.  Something else I have read is
that the fuel accumalator could be faulty and not holding pressure.  How do
I test these items without throwing money at just replacing thm.

Any help would be appreciated.

Jay
