The previous owner of my P-car replaced with one of these carbon-fiber
units too, but said it was by B&B. Are you sure yours is by Borla? Mine is
about 7" round in diameter and 22" long with 3" pipes in and out, and
yours? I'm curious to know what these things weigh, I've been told about 5
pounds?

Mine is very loud, but nice sound. I think because there  was a resonator
or pre-muffler after the cat that had been removed?
