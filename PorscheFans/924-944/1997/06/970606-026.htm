I have two 1983 944.s. One is my daily driver, 1150 kg, 200 hp,through
Nitous oxide, also used for clubracing and
autocrossing.The second one is a non streetable racecar used only for
national touringcar races. Until this year
raced NA at 1080 kg and 180 hp.This year 1050 kg and supercharged at 250 hp
 approx.
In factory setup and normally driven the 944 is reasonable neutral in
corners with a little understeer.
Driven very hard the car understeers badly. This can be compensated by
leveling the car (front and rear at the
same height) and stiffening the rear suspension and shocks. Only stiffening
 the rear will cause the inner rear
tire to loose traction in fast tight corners if you do not have LSD. To
counteract you will have to stiffen the
front also, but less then the rear, because of the understeer problem. I
have lowered my daily driver 3cm, setting the
height front and rear the same, 25mm swaybar front, 18mm rear (made stiffer
 by relocating the hole for the connecting
bar forward). Yellow konis set front 0.5 turn from stiff and rear full
stiff.Using soft compount kumho's I easily win
in my class every event Overall I get only beaten by a young 911RS and
993's at autocross. I easily outrun standard
951's and 968's (normal tires, less experienced drivers). On the Zandvoort
track (a very twisty 2.5 km track with a short
straight) I can keep up with the 911RS and the 993's (on normal tires with
experienced drivers).
I use my car on a regular basis in Germany and tried different rear shock
settings in hight speed long sweeping autobahn
curves at almost 140mph. There is a marked difference in rear-end stability
 between full stiff and softer settings.
At full stiff the car is very stable. At softer settings the rear will sway
 a little all the time, especially when the
surfice of the road is not completely flat. I read the books about handling
 and suspension setup, but this is just
personal experience.

Todd Leen responds,

>>I'm not sure this is contrary to theory.  From physics,
>>the whole mass-spring-dampener system will equilibriate fastest
>>when it's 'critically' damped.  More damping than this and the
>>response slows down, less damping and the body roll (and weight
>>transfer) overshoots and rebounds before it equilibriates -- so
>>the response slows down again.
>>
>>Does anyone know if shock adjustments typically straddle this
>>critically damped point (which depends on spring stiffness and
>>roll inertia -- so "typical" is ambiguous)?
>>
>>To physics, add the driver  -- maybe the ideal is to have
>>weight transfer equilibrate on the order of the driver response
>>(or 'perception') time, rather than as fast as possible.
>>
>>Comments anyone?  I'd welcome a discussion of this.
