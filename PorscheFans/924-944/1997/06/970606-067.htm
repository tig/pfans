Michael-

I too had switched to Mobil 1 about 6K mi ago when I read the post about it
may be harmful to 944 trannies.  Anyway I called the Mobil tech line to
speak to one of their people about this because the warning is on their web
site (sorry don't have the address.) as stated in the previous post.  Turns
out that yes the oil does meet and exceed GL-5 standards.  Unfortunately the
manual in the 944 says use GL-4.  This rating is an indicator of the
additives used to increase the effectiveness of the oil.  Mobil's additive
is sulfur-phosphate which the tech guy told me will attack bronze parts and
cause pitting in them.  I believe the synchro's in the tranny are all
bronze, please correct me if I am wrong, and therefor will be damaged by
their additive.  I also placed a call to PCNA to talk to a tech guy there,
didn't speak to him directly but left him voicemail.  His reply concurred
with the Mobil tech's position.  Anyway yesterday I switched to Amsoil synth
gear lube with the appropriate GL-4 rating. The shift action is just as
smooth as the Mobil.

HTH,  I'm not trying to cause rampant paranoia.
