[It seems the mail server didn't put these two emails up, so I'm sending
 them again]

Howdy,

The whole S2 VS. 951 debate is kind of silly, but hey, I'm in a silly 
kind of mood today.  I was fortunate enough to swap cars with Wes (S2)
for a drive home from an autocross (where he kicked my butt by 2 seconds
I might add!).  The first thing I should say is that I like all Porsches,
the 914/911/912/356 (I love this one)/944/924/etc/etc.  So, take my
comments as a point of view, rather than as criticism.  

When I drove Wes's car, I noticed his exhaust was VERY loud, everything
resonated in the car and at a certain RPM, you could hear something
buzzing from under the car.  This would drive me batty, but he has
an aftermarket exhaust on the car (which I will talk about later).  The
initial torque is nice, but not what I expected, then when you are
really laying into it, there is nothing there.  The power increase is
smooth, almost deceiving.  The only time I realized that the S2 has more
low-end torque than my car was when I pulled alongside Wes (who was
driving my car) and blew the doors off him across the intersection.  I
actually bounced off the rev-limiter because I was not expecting the
revs to rise so fast.  I also noticed that the gearing is quite a bit
shorter than the 951.  Put this car's gearing in the 951 and I bet the 951
will feel a whole lot more flexible.

On the way back from this autocross, we had Wes boosting way ahead in
my red 951, then it was me trying in vain to keep up in the red S2.  Behind
me was Tim in his gold 951, then behind him was Darren in his garnet
951 and Paul in his black 951.  Quite a show.  After trying like heck to
catch Wes (the S2 was on R1s so I was flat out through the sweepers,
but every straight, I'd see my 951 squat and be gone), I decided to play
with Tim in his chipped 951(S).  No contest, he absolutely blew the doors
off me down the straights and even in the bends where traction was no
problem, he left me in the S2 for dead.  That is something I can't 
deal with, I must be ahead, I must be ahead!

So, why does the S2 have such allure?  It's the driveability, no turbo
lag, seems less hairtrigger than my car.  The car feels like it will
last longer just because it doesn't feel like a timebomb (all turbo cars
feel like a timebomb, that's what makes them so exciting).  I am not the
only one that feels this way as I will quote some passengers below.

The only thing that keeps bugging me is that I think Wes's exhaust is
actually taking performance away from the car.  Maybe he should come down
for dyno day (which BTW has been postponed a bit because the shop's fans
were not big enough to prevent detonation and overheating, they've ordered
two new HUGE fans) with a stock exhaust and the carbon fibre one.  I could
swear that Bill Buetow's car had a lot more low-end torque.

A fellow list member came out to an autocross where Wes and I were running.
I am quoting his private email to me which is not usually a good thing,
but I don't think he'll mind since he CC'ed it to myself and Wes as well
as the comments purtain to this quite well.  I feel he does a good job
of describing exactly the feeling between the two cars:

I think that sums it up pretty good.

Farzaan.
