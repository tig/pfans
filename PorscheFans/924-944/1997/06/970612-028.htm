after many hours of cleaning my baby yesterday,even took out the front seats to 
clean under them, i have to say WOW does it ever look BAD ASS!!!!!!! i never 
even noticed until i looked at it through the window at work.  

I am going to have some minor body work including the hood repainted and the 
lady asked me the year, i said 85 she said there is a 25$ fee for the estimate 
cuz it is more than 10 years old, when i drove up she said what year is it and i 
said 94, she said it sure looks nice, then when i told her it was an 85 she 
waived the 25$ fee, i guess it would fit right in show rooms today!!!
