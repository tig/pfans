Hey all, if you know anyone interested, this is potential hot car for
SCCA autox. And we all know how SCCA likes to punish our marque, this
would be a great way to get even. :)

Rich is a local autoxer here and apparently is gearing up for a new car.
I have seen the car and it really is immaculate. And although I would
never desire to eat of an engine, if I had to I'd pick that one. It's
that clean. I have no stake in this short of wishing the car would be
bought by a P-fan and autoxed regularly. :)

From: Rich Fletcher <richf@frontier.net>

1988 Porsche 924S
Only 66,000 miles, Guards Red, immaculate garage queen inside and out;
ask
Jeff Reitmeir and he'll tell you you can "eat off the motor".  It also
has
a killer stereo and an Ungo alarm system.  It has recently been given a
new
clutch, water pump, timing belts, motor mounts, and lotsa love.  It
needs
for nothing. Truly a great car.  I mean, this baby looks and smells new.
Asking $7,900.  Buy this car and have major fun in SCCA C-Stock AND
Porsche
club events.

People might ask: "Why are you selling your cars, Rich?"  Simple.  I
need
the money.  Annnnd, well, there MAY be another car on the horizon... ;-)
