I replaced the muffler on my 87 944S last fall and after shopping around
came to the conclusion that the factory muffler was the least hassle. It
cost me $1,000.00 Canadian (parts & labour) which is about $700.00 US. The
shop that did it was willing to put in any after market mufflers I could
find but wouldn't offer me any guarantee except for the factory part. When
I priced out the cost of after market parts, shipping and extra labour to
fit it properly it came out about the same. I really don't believe the
horsepower increases some of the companies quote. The factory unit has very
little flow restriction. It took about two weeks to get the factory
muffler. By the time it came I basically had nothing past the resonator. I
didn't notice any difference in power without the muffler or after the new
one was installed. Some of the after market units do sound better at
autocrosses though. The factory unit was one piece (resonator + muffler +
pipes + tip).
