Porschefans:

My beloved '92 968 6-speed coupe (55k miles) has been unhappy a lot lately.
 I lost the clutch a month ago ($1050 with dealer discount), the fan
thermoswitch and thermostat 2 weeks ago ($300), and I have the car scheduled
to go to an excellent independent shop in a week for further work --
Steinel's Autowerks near Cleveland.

The point of this note is that the car has developed a strange engine symptom
over the past 2 months which is getting worse.  It is intermittent, occurring
when the car is warm and often on the highway or on secondary roads at 30-45
mph.  The car will be driving fine, and then I feel the engine lose some
power, the engine note gets much less sweet and louder, and there is a
distinct vibration which I can feel through the gas pedal and the clutch
which seems to come from the front end.  The vibration persists, even if I
depress the clutch and let the rpms fall to idle (?).  It usually lasts for a
minute or two.  If I get off at an exit or stop for traffic, it is generally
gone when I start off again.  As I slow for the exit, however, the vibration
seems to get worse (larger amplitude) until I stop.  In fact, I am not
completely sure that it is a motor problem at all, as it could be a front end
suspension problem which comes and goes.
With regard to the suspension, the car tracks straight and true on the
highway and the tires have no unusual wear patterns.  It has not been aligned
lately.

This problem really does not feel like a wheel/tire balance problem.  My
tires are new Pirelli P7000 Supersports on stock 16" wheels and they balanced
up very well a few weeks ago.  The problem was identical on the D40 M2s which
I had on before.  My motor mounts were checked about 3 months ago at the
dealer and were pronounced in good shape.  I run only Shell 93 octane gas.  I
used Techron to clean the injectors.  I know that the good folks at Steinel's
will find the problem, but I would like to know if the cumulative experience
of the list members could be helpful.

Sorry for the lengthy post.  I find the problem difficult to describe more
succinctly.  Thanks in advance for your help.
