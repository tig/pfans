I just got back from the first thing that never cost me and involved my
car. The local Porsche dealer MCL (Vancouver, Canada) had a free service
clinic sponsored by Porsche. It was great. My car was on the hoist for
about 30 minutes and I was able to go over the whole car with a mechanic
asking him questions. The mechanic knew a lot about 944's as he used to
race them. I learned more in that 1/2 hour than the last 6 months. He even
fixed a couple of small problems like a heat shield on backwards etc. for
free. It's obviously a fishing trip for my business but it worked. I'll
give them a try next time I get something done. The service manager did
seem a little disappointed that the only problem was a small oil leak I
already knew about. I heard him give one guy an estimate for several
thousand for the problems they found on his 911.

P.S. Further to the thread on Boxters the mechanic said he tried one last
weekend in Seattle. He was duking it out with a twin turbo and surprised
them both by being competitive. He said he has driven all the recent
Porsches on the track and the Boxter probably handles the best. He was also
on S-02's, seems like they're the tire of choice.
