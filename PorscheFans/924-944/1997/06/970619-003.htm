Friends,

This is the first time I am posting a request for some information on my 
car.  I have a 89 944 S2 with 85k miles.  The car makes a strange sound.  
Even when I drive the car for a couple of minutes, the cooling fan begins.  
The engine is not warm, yet the fan comes on.  My mechanic is a bit 
perplexed with the why's and how's of the problem.  Anyone have or had a 
similar problem ?

On another note, I live in the UK and as all of you are probably well aware,
 there is a lot of rain.  My car is a cab, and it always leaks at exactly 
the point where the roof meets the front windshield.  My mechanicss view is 
that I need to replace the seal that borders the windshield.  I am not sure 
if that is going to solve the problem.  Can any of you old Prosche hands 
lend me a hand since I have been a proud owner for less than a year.

PS can anyone recommend some reading which may enlighten me on my car ?

Thanks very much for your help.

Regards,
Saleem
