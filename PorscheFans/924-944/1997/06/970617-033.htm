I agree. I prefer to watch road races over ovals. Of course, if you're
there in person, it's much easier to watch an oval.

There are still lots of challenges to the driver. Try keeping a 3400 lb
car with 700 HP running on 9.5" wheels, about 1/2" away from the car
next to you, all the while running as hard as you can. Now do that 
for a few hours. There are lot of differences between F1 and NASCAR,
but the drivers of both series are excellent.

Well, if Earnhardt could catch Schumaker, I'd like to see the look
on Schumaker's face when Earnhardt 'leaned' on him in the corners.
I don't think the open wheeled drivers would handle that too well.
It's standard practice in NASCAR.

The high technology is a big part of the problem for F1. Everything is 
so expensive that there are only a few teams with the resources to win.
Remove Ferrari and Williams, and who stands a chance? In NASCAR, since
everyone is on equal footing (more or less) the cost of a competitive
car is about 100K, there are lots of competitive teams. You never 
know who is going to win until the race is over.

Maybe it's different in the south. In the northeast, lots of family's
go to the races.
