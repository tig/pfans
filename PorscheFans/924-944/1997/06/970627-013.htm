Hello,

I removed the set screw and pried, but the rotor just fell apart, so now
I'm left with the knurled brass part stuck on.  Should I just heat it
and pull with pliers?  ???

Thanks,
Fred

     I notice that when I park the car at night after a hard drive and open 
     the
     hood, the exhaust manifolds are glowing orange (!) in the noninsulated 
     areas of the primary pipes near the head flanges and at the 3-bolt 
     flanges
     connecting the manifolds to the crossover pipe.  Is this normal for a 
     951?
     I realize that it uses ceramic exhaust port liners and insulated pipes 
     to
     keep exhaust gas velocity/temperature up for the turbo way over on the
     intake side of the engine, but orange seems a bit hot.
     
     
        Eric,
     
     This phenomenon is perfectly normal for all 951's.  Turbocharged 
     exhaust gas is hotter than you think.  Enthusiastic driving will 
     produce this orange glow, HOWEVER, THE GLOW SHOULDN'T LAST MORE THAN A 
     FEW SECONDS BEFORE DIMMING OUT!  My mechanics were testing another 
     951's cooling system (or something) and had it revved to like 4000 
     RPM's for like ten minutes.  At one point, those exposed parts of the 
     manifold that are not covered by the heat shields were glowing bright 
     orange, and the exhaust pipe from the cat back was also a faint orange 
     too!  Once the car had idled for less than 10 seconds, the glow 
     disappeared.  But remember, this car was PARKED and had no airflow 
     besides the fans to cool the exhaust down.  It is NOT normal if your 
     exhaust sustains this glow for a long period of time (more than a few 
     seconds).
        My mechanic said our exhausts could handle this "abuse" and 
     actually encourages me to try and reproduce the phenomenon myself, 
     just in case I want to impress my friends at night.  While the intense 
     heat itself is not harmful to the car, its duration could be an 
     indication of a more serious problem (like you've already suggested).
        By the way, these things sure look a lot better than those neon 
     strip lights people install underneath their Honda Civics.
     
     Ben
