I've been lurking on the list for several weeks now as I consider the
purchase of a 944 to replace my current car.  I was wondering if anyone
would like to offer their take on using the 944 as a daily driver, what
are the costs involved, and how does it compare (power/performance wise)
to a 2nd generation RX-7?

Steve,

When I bought my first 944, I had initially intended to buy a 2nd
generation RX-7.  I drove a few of the Mazdas including one low mileage
example that was flawless.  All were nice cars and fun to drive, but
they were not very robust and most of the controls felt rubbery.  I then
drove a beat up 944 and knew that this was the model (but NOT the car)
for me.  Unlike the RX-7, I had a very connected feel to the vehicle --
I really was part of the driving experience.  I then drove a gorgeous
'86 944 NA with 100,000 miles that just blew me away.  It was the
tightest car I had ever driven and it was incredibly responsive.  It was
as if the car didn't realize it had covered so many miles in its life.

Having come from years of driving heavily modified, overachieving cars,
the 944s are very different.  With the other cars, I always had the
impression that I was extracting all the performance the cars had to
offer.  However, the 944 almost seem to have an attitude that says no
matter how fast you drive the car, it is capable of even more.  It seems
to challenge you to find that next level in yourself -- it is such an
incredibly satisfying ride. 

I now own an '86 951.  I spend about $1,000/year on maintenance, but
then again I am more paranoid about the Porsche and will fix something
if there is even a hint of a problem.  Check out the 944 FAQ at
http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html  It will tell you what
to look out for when buying a 944.

Good luck,
