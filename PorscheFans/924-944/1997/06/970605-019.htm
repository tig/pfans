Firstly if you are in the market for a atmo car save a little longer and
by an S2. Bigger, better engine; more hp, torque speed etc. Turbo nose
and rear valance . Avoid RX7s unless you plan on an engine rebuild every
6 months. A friend of mine had a 2nd gen RX7 until recently, my 951
was/is cheaper to own than his car would ever be. I can only compare his
modified RX7 to my 951, it was not comparable. One car is a finely
engineered piece of automotive art the other is a pile of crap. Mine was
much much faster too.

my 5 cents worth ( Kiwi money is worthless)

Hello all,

I've been lurking on the list for several weeks now as I consider the
purchase of a 944 to replace my current car.  I was wondering if anyone
would like to offer their take on using the 944 as a daily driver, what
are the costs involved, and how does it compare (power/performance wise)
to a 2nd generation RX-7?
