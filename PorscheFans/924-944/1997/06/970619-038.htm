	Check your belts first. All of them, I mean, including the
	timing, balance. and cam belts that under the protective
	shroud. If they're all good, check the idlers on them. If they're
	the original idlers, they could easily be worn out by 75K. Worn
	idlers can make a "whirring" or "squealing" sound at various
	rpms. If they're okay, check your water pump and alternator
	for worn bushings or pulleys. Good luck!
