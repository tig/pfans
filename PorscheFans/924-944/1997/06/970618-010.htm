I have been reading the list for a while and have not seen anything that =
relates to my problem.  I have a 1986 NA 944.  I have had the car for =
almost 4 years and recently it has started to develop a problem when the =
throttle is depressed all the way.  Unfortunately it does not do it all =
the time, but sometimes it seems that the car is going to die when the =
throttle is depressed all the way.  It does it at any rpm and if I =
depress the clutch when it does this the car goes to a idle condition =
but surging from idle to 1500 rpm about once every 2 seconds.  This =
means I am rolling down the road with the clutch pedal pressed all the =
way and the gas pedal all the way and the car is idling.=20

At first I thought that the problem was related to the air flow sensor =
but I can not find anything wrong with it.  I also checked the throttle =
switches and they check out OK also ( must work since the car only does =
it when the full throttle switch is actuated.)  Recently I read that at =
full throttle the computer goes to automatic full enrichment and ignores =
the flow sensor altogether ?  Is this true ?

The only other sensors I have not checked are the crankshaft positioning =
sensors but since they seem to work OK when not going full throttle I am =
kind of at a loss at this time.  It would be hard to believe that the =
computer would malfunction only when it gets the full throttle input =
switch, but then again anything is possible.

I hope somebody can shed some light on this issue. =20
