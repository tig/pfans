Is there a label on the inside of the central electric system cover?  
Mine does, and it labels everything very well.

I have an '89, so I'll post this just for information only.  The warning 
buzzer is labeled on the central electic system cover as "G16 
gong/catalytic converter warn."  It is a tallish black relay, with little 
holes on top for the tiny speaker.  It sounds when the door is open with the 
keys in the ignition, etc.

G12 is labeled as "complimentary driving light."  I'm not sure what that 
is, as there is already an existing fog light and high beam relay.  Hmm.
Maybe for the 951 euro driving lights, but the relay is present in my US 
NA car.  Hmm.  Goes against the policy of not installing the relay for 
options not ordered.
