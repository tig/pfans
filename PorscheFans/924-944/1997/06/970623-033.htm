I too had the dreaded steering shake, and pulled all of my hair out getting
the problem solved.  It turned out to be a combination of tire balance 
(make SURE the person who does the balance sets the machine on the fine
setting and respins the tire after adding weights to double check - most
will just spin once, add weight, and take the wheel/tire off the machine and
call it done) and a bent wheel.  Wheel was only bent on the inside rim,
making it tough to notice.  To check this - 
1. Jack up one side, turn the steering towards the side being checked to provide
access to both the outside and inside of the wheel rim.
2. Use some fixed indicator (dial indicator base, paper cup w/pencil poked
through it, etc.) to "point" at the rim edge.
3. Spin the wheel and note any side-to-side or vertical runout - in my case rim
had about 10 mm of vertical runout on the inside and 0 on the outside, so I sent
it to a wheel straightening/refinishing place.

Also, beware - tire shops with old bead-breaking equipment can easily destroy
or bend Porsche wheels during tire removal.  In my case the other unbent 16x7 
phone dial was "egged" when the bead breaker at an unnamed tire chain store
caught the rim.  The store at first said that I must have "hit a curb" until I 
showed them that the wheel wouldn't bolt back on to the car (was so bent that 
it hit the caliper)!  There were fresh scrape marks on the rim I.D. from the
bead
breaker.  Needless to say, I go straight to the dealer to have tires mounted
now.
