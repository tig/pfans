Hi Bill
I have been using the Mityvac for some time now and I completely agree with
Marv that as a vacuum tool for brakebleeding it is not the way to go.
However,
If you use the pressure side of the Mityvac in combination with a spare
reservoir cap
it works perfect. You cannot overpressurize the reservoir and pressurising
the reservoir allows bleeding of two wheels. Then refill and pressurize
again
for the next two wheels or the clutch cylinder.
regards
Peter

Subject: Re: Brake Fluid Bleeder Tool
I just received a spare reservoir cap from George B. (Thanks George!).  I
plan to put a fitting on the top and connect it to a large reservoir jar
which will have a fitting for low pressure compressed air.  I will use a
small electric pump I have to supply the pressure.
I have used the Mity-Vac and have the blisters to prove it.  So will you if
you use it to evacuate the whole system.  After the wounds heal you should
have one hell of a grip!
