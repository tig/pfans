My 1980 931 was running great. Alas, gradually the idle got worse and
worse until it won't idle at all. I decided to change plugs first. I had
Bosch Platinum WR8DP in the car. However, after reading all the bad
things about these plugs on this list I do not want to use them anymore.
The owners manual calls for either Bosch WR7DS or Champion N8GY. These
plugs cost $11.99 and $13.99 each. Why so high. Nobody carries these
plugs and always want to give me a substitute. What about resistor, non
resistor. Both are listed as alternatives for this car. I think the
ignition wires are original style, as they are metal shielded where they
go into the cylinder head. The plugs I removed have the threaded top
connector rather than the snap on style. Is this correct, or will the
snap on style also work. OK experts, here's your chance to display your
plug knowledge. Thanks in advance to all who respond.
