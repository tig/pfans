No problem? Heck, I almost roast to death in my 924 in 20 degrees Celsius!
OK, I don't have AC, but these cars seem to attract heat more than most

No, they made tons of these. All of the 924s/944s sold in Great Britain were
Lux-models. I'm not sure what the difference is, though. Can't be that much.
