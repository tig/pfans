Remember that debate about if this is the correct forum for voicing
complaints about dealerships, shops or retailers. I said that this is the
perfect place to let problems be voiced as well as praise. My own 10 month
saga about the defective R1 is over. The guys at Eurotire in NJ
(201-575-0080) helped me get retribution from B.F. Goodrich. I bough a set
of R1's and after 1 day on the track, in the rain no less, one tire showed
cord at the surface. Eurotire sent the tire back to Goodrich who lost the
tire ect. The final outcome was I contacted Goodrich today and left voice
mail for Bob Munney explaining the problem, including the fact that they
lost the defective tire. Gina called me back within an hour telling me that
they would credit my charge card or send me a new tire. The tire will be
here by Friday! I know Kevin Gross had a similar problem with not so
favorable results, he let the list know, which is why I am letting the list
know about my results. Eurotire followed through, but it took a call from
the customer to light the fire under Goodrichs' butt. The next time you see
me at the track I will still have R1's as shoes.
