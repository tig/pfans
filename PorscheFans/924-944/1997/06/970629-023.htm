Maurice:

	First of all, when you order the switch you get a switch with seven metal
prongs or contacts sticking out the back which will go through the holes
which will be magically created with the desoldering iron.

	The procedure, form memory, is roughly as follows:

1. remove the two round knobs (fan speed and temp control) by pulling.  
2. remove the two oblong knobs on the sliders by pulling.
3. remove the faceplate by pulling
4. using needle nose pliers,  remove the nut that screws to the base of the
temp control switch.
5. I think there are two phillips head screws to remove 
6. The whole climate control module can now be gently pulled away from the
dash enough to see that it is attached to the car by three (I think) wiring
harnesses which simply unclip.
7. Hopefully, you're now holding the climate control module in your hand or
cursing me.
8. The back separates from the front by dislodging the plastic "clips" that
you can see snapped into place on the front of the module (I broke a couple
with no ill effect).
9. Once the back is off you will see the circuitry. On mine, the factory
had put a putty like substance in there which was easily removed.
10. With the putty off, you will see the seven little solder "bumps" which
correspond to the connectors on the switch.
11. Using the desoldering iron (its really a lot easier than it looks or
sounds) you will melt and slurp the solder form the old connections, and
the old switch can be gently pried out.
12. fit the new switch in so that the connectors enter the holes.
13. deposit solder upon each connector.
14. I stuck some of the old putty back as best I could (I suppose this is
to make sure the a/c doesn't vibrate off at 140 mph).
15. re-assemble.

	CAVEAT:  I could not locate the notes I made when I did this. If you hit a
roadblock, please contact me again.
