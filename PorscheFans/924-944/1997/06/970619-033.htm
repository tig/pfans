I like NASCAR and as long as Tom Cruise or
Burt Reynolds are not driving everything
is cool, if a little red-neckish.  I 
really like the latest iteration of the Firebird.
I think that at certain angles it looks fat,
but you absolutely cannot disagree that those
big engines and fat tires make for a very formidable
package.  If GM could lower overall weight on their
F-Bodies and make a consistent build quality
those cars would be perfect.  As it is, the dealer
repair network is not trustworthy, some engines
might last 20k miles and some 100k, (GM does not care) the newest
aluminum blocked 'Vettes and F-Bodies are not
in any way life tested (I had 2 Vegas, aluminum
and GM did not mix then), and for 25k dollars
I could have a seriously tricked out 944,
a 928S4 (GTS soon), a decent super-modified
VW Porsche, a used Lotus, a used Ferrari,
a big-block Hemi, an airplane, half a house,
a swimming pool, my multi-engine rating, a
Harley-Davidson Fat Boy and a crotch rocket...
I paid $7,500 for my car, and unless it blows up...
Also, insurance on a new 'Bird is a minimum
of $1400 dollars a year, ICK!  My 951 is $600
per year, and I have a LOT of tickets.
