        Dear 944 Owners:

  I bought this 1987 944 4 months ago, put 4500 miles on it in Maryland, and 
now that the weather is getting hotter, I notice the car is running hotter
when I bring it down from highway speeds, to a dead stop (like in a traffic
jam). The temperature rises dramatically in a matter of several minutes.

I checked to see if the fan was running when idling , and it was -- but only
ONE fan comes on.  Even when I stopped the car -- only one of the two fans
ever come on -- IS THIS ABNORMAL???   I mean where are there two fans , If
I only see one ever work???

I could put in a lower temparature themostat (but the 180 for the state of
MD should be OK), I could also buy a lower temp fan switch from the Performance
catalog I have been getting.  Or do you recommend a coolant flush??? The car 
only has 69,000 miles on it (taken care of the first 8 years of its life OK,
but can't exactly say that for the last two years by owner #3, I am onwer #4)

I have read in past issues of Excellence Magazine that the 944 runs hot and
that they recommend a coolant flush?? (it has been so long since I read that
article, am I remembering things correctly??)

                                Any insights would be appreciated,

                                David Johnston
                                1987 Porsche 944
                                69,000 miles
