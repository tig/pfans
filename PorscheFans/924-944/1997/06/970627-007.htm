<< I better start feeding it no-fat gas!!!
 Seriously,  I was pretty surprised at how heavy it was.  E stock rules allow
 this car to run at 2998 (about 100 lbs more than the non-S turbos),  but I
 think it would be pretty tough to drop 190 lbs. while keeping the car legal
 and streetable in other respects --especially now that a/c can't be legally
 removed.  The spare tire and jack just aren't that heavy!!!

My Turbo-S, stock E class with roll bar, weights 3030 with 1/3 tank of fuel.
It was done by substituting racing seats on both sides, fiberglass replica
Euro bumper, and 
lite exhaust system. BTW the stock wheels are about as light as you can get.
I also removed the rear seat back, the part that reclines , which is a grey
area in the rules.
Just sold the car and the new owner can attest to the weight of the stock
parts since he was busy loading them into his van last night. It's like
anything else. Just throw money in the proper direction and you can buy
lightness!

Jerry
