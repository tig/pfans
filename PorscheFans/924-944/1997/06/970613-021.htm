Wow. This circuit is more complex than I thought. Still can't get one fan
to work, even tho the fan motor's OK. Bypassed the temp switch, and still
only one fan works. Switched fuses around and still no luck. Switched the
G10 radiator relay boxes with a friend who has an '86 Turbo, and still no
luck, but that's not entirely solved because the Turbo is an '86, and
Carlsen said that the boxes would be identical on an S2 and '87 on Turbos
(altho the parts numbers were the same).

So I'm coming to the conclusion that one of the parallel lines to the 2
fans has a break somewhere. The only thing I haven't checked in these lines
from the temp switch to relay box to fuses to fans are single resistors
that exist somewhere in each fan circuit. Have no idea where these are
located, but might be under the fuse box panel. 

So Scott or other Pfans - if you have any suggestions - would certainly
appreciate them.
