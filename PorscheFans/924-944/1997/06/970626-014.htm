     Greetings,
     
     I'd been searching for a place to get my car weighed and I finally 
     found one. Seeing as how horsepower is only half of the equation, I 
     thought someone might be interested in what I found. I went to a local 
     moving company and used their truck scale. It was free as long as I 
     didn't need an official weight slip. (of course I didn't). Anyway, 
     with half a tank of gas (approx. 60lbs.)  my 86 951 weighed 3020lbs. 
     Here are some details:
     
     No cruise control
     No central Locking
     No leather interior (I have cloth with vinyl)
     Spare, jack, and toolkit replaced with a trusty can of Fix-A-Flat
     No muffler
     has Sunroof
     has A/C
     has power windows
     17" 993 turbo replicas w225 & 255 bfgoodrich tires
     
     The car was pretty much empty except for a 10-disk changer, fire 
     extinguisher, and a half a tank of gas. It was a bit heavier than I 
     expected. Oh well, time to start removing stuff. Who needs A/C anyway.
     
     I'd be interested to hear if anyone has any comparable weights, perhaps of 
     your stripped out race car. 
     -Rod
