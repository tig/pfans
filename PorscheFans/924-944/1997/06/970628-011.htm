<<You might also give Jason Burkett at Paragon Products(800-200-9366 or
512-289-8834) a call, since he also distributes Weltmeister, and is a
frequent contributor to this list besides.  He also sells Koni and K&N
products.  I had the chance to meet him face to face last week at the
Porsche Parade, and he is a truly nice guy.  He must know what he is
doing,
too, because he won our auto-x class quite handily (he beat me by 6
seconds
over a 60 second course, but, then, he was also using "sticky" tires,
and I
was on 25,000 mile old Bridgestone RE71's).>>

For the record I wasn't recommending Automotion! Far from it! I was only
clarifying that Automotion *is* Weltmeister. It is one and the same
company. For some reason, Automotion tries to keep it quiet (probably
because they compete head-to-head with their own distributors). 

If a fine distributor (such as Paragon) can get them for you that's
great. If they can get them from someone other than Automotion, that's
even better!
