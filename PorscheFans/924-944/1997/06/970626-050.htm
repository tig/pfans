A few weeks ago I purchased my first Porsche.  I am the proud owner of
an '88 944 Turbo S, mint condition with only 48,000 miles.  The other
day I encountered my first (and hopefully last) problem.  While
accelerating in 4th gear under strong turbo boost, I felt like I hit a
rock wall.  At first I thought that I hit something!  The car slowed 
dramtically as if my boost just completely stopped.  After slowing down
and pulling off the road I noticed that all of the guages were in normal
range.  The problem is that I now feel that the turbo has lost a
significant amount of its original "seat pressing" power.  The gauge
still operates normally and I can feel the turbo kick in, but it is not
the way it used to be.  The dealer I took it to said there was no
problem with it, but I know differently. They said that if it happens
again, to bring it back and they will pull the turbo apart to see if
they can find anything.  You all can understand why I would like to
avoid that situation!  
Any feedback would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
