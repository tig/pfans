Kurt ( Mr. T )

I have a 1981 924/T and have also heard relay noises under the dash
recently. What also occured at about the same time was my windshield
wipers operated once then returned to the normal position while
I was driving. 

After the second time that the wipers did this in a period of two days
I noticed the relay noises so while driving down the road I began to feel
under the dash ( Kids don't try this at home or with your parents car )
found the relay that was " Clicking " and gently worked it side to side
and in other directions being careful not to unplug it but trying to seat
it in its socket and improve the electrical connection.

Since then the problem has not occured yet ???

Hope this helps.
