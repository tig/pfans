As I recal the 968 turbo S rolled of the factory floor with ~ 305 hp and
the turbo RS close to 350 hp. I believe the turbo S was the homologation
car for turbo RS.

Yes it did, or? In the January issue of 911 & Porsche World, there is a
968
Turbo RS for sale (=A338.000). The ad says it was prepared, whatever =
that
means, by a company called Digit-Power. 475 HP! I think Porsche made a
handful of these cars. Granted, it is not *mass* production, but.. :)
