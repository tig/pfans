Hey Balaji,
	Regarding your power steering fluid leak.  I think you diagnosed your
problem.  It's being caused by the leaking hose from the reservoir to
the P/S pump.  I had this same problem last year.  The hose end near the
P/S fluid reservoir gets hard and cracks with age.  Tightening up on the
hose clamp won't work after a while.  So I replaced the hose.
	This "serpentine" hose that runs from the reservoir, along the front of
the engine, down to the pump has been replaced with one that runs
straight to the pump (like it should have been done in the first
place).	 You will need to purchase a new fitting, and crush washer, that
attaches to the P/S pump as well.
	The replacement procedure is simple.  Drain the reservoir (messy);
remove the offending hose; replace P/S pump fitting with the new one;
replace with the improved design hose; refill the reservoir and your
through.  Also be sure to check the bushing for the sway bar under the
P/S pump.  Mine had swollen from the leaking P/S fluid and had to be
replaced.
	You may also want to check the steering rack for leaks, but you will
need to replace this hose regardless.  Hope this helps.
