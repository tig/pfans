The back should be feeling 'softer' than the front - so it is probably
OK. Then, setting the shocks harder may compensate for any wear.  

No, adjusting the spring plates do not make the springs any softer. It
only differs the ride height (a little). Torsion bars usually do not get
softer with age, unless they are rust damaged.
