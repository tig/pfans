Hi - new (89.1 N/A) 944 owner here.

> It was in immaculate condition (112k, but perfectly maintained by >one 
fastidious owner)
> until the Bastards broke into it last night.
> OK, after three days they knew where it was (concealed in locked 
>garage) and appear to have been
> halfway professional (no sign of forced entry, but completely >destroy 
ignition/steering).  How did they
> know where it was ?  Followed me home ? Maybe. Car Dealer ? >Unlikely. 
Insurance Co. ? Possible.
> Licensing Centre ? My best bet.
> Anyway - it's off being fixed, and if it goes again it's up for sale. 
Anyone got ideas on how to keep these things ??  It has a Factory >Alar 
(LEDs in door locks etc), but this
> obviously didn't deter them. By the way I'm in Perth, Western 
Australia - any other downunders >wan't to talk 944, EMAIL me
> at ian_saunders@ferntree.com.au

 IanS.

I have one suggestion.  A Glock.
