Pfans --

Thanks for the feedback on Waterwetter.  Thought you might be interested in
some results that I consider tenative until I get to a track event.  My S2
engine has always run hotter than my previous late '85, particularly under
track conditions, or situations like slowing down behind trucks on a hill. 
The temp has never gone past the 2/3 mark, but it would get there without
much provocation.

Added 9 oz. of Waterwetter to a 50/50 antifreeze mixture and got the
following results.  

When cruising at 80, the engine used to sit at just over the 1/3 temp mark.
Now it's just under that mark. Not anything major, but seems to be
consistent.

The engine used to go to 2/3s quickly with a lot of heavy braking from 80
to 30, dropping from 4th to 2nd and then heavy acceleration. Track
conditions. I did about 20-25 of these sequences and the temp didn't go
past 55-60% on the gauge.

Did a couple of 130-135 mph runs, pulling over and idling right after each,
and the temp rose to about 55-60%. Same result after coming back into town
after a hard run and idling in traffic. This used to put the temp near the
2/3s mark.

So far the Waterwetter seems to have made a difference. Perhaps its wishful
thinking at this point.  More tests are needed.
