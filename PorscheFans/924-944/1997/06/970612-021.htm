The process is also called Nikasil coating. (Nik a Sil, from Nickel and
Silicon) It is a (patented?) treatment of aluminium (or rather aluminium
alloy - there are some to choose from) for hardness and wear resistance.
Reputedly, this is done by Mahle, well known supplier of pistons and
cylinders to Porsche (and others). There was Nikasil treated cylinders
of aluminium available in the 70's, as very trick tuning parts for
Porsche and later became standard components in some 911. 

The Nikasil treatment is like a coating, that is bonded to the cylinder
apertures on a molecular level. If it destroyed, it cannot be easily
repaired. It is therefore not a good idea to hone cylinder bores on
Nikasil treated cylinder bores when changing pistons or rings. Reboring
is not practically possible, and those needing a 'rebore' may have to
refrain to (dry) cylinder liners instead.
