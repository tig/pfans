Hi Mohit was there any replies to your post you can share? I thought you
use the Perfect-It G first then Imp. HG after to remove any traces of
Perfect-It and for the finer abrasive effect?

Is the Perfect-It Glaze the same stuff as the Perfect-It Swirl Mark
Remover in a larger size?

The 3M web page lists the ingredients in each product, Imp. HG lists
Aluminum Silicate as part of its makeup, this is a finer abrasive than
Aluminum Oxide?

My Perfect-It bottle says to rub until dry, no mention of letting it sit
before buffing.

Can the streaking be removed by using something like Perfect-It Gloss
Enhancer/ Meguiars #34 Final Inspection? Interestingly the ingredients
listed for the gloss enhancer is just water and isopropyl alcohol. I would
think this would tend to remove any wax. Maybe it just softens it and
makes the wax level?

Which 3M product would I use that is one step more agressive than the
Perfect-It glaze, "Finesse-It" or "Fine-Cut Rubbing Compound paste? or
liquid?" ? TIA
