Barry Lenoble responded:

>Yeah, me.

I used one to bleed the brakes on my 944 all the time. I think it came
from Automotion^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H some overpriced P-Car boutique. I
found the trick was to use the vaseline-looking stuff that came with it
on the threads of the bleeder nipples. Most of the air bubbles were
caused by the air being sucked by the threads. I also found that you
didn't want to use too much vacuum and that you needed to keep good
track of the fluid reservoir level.

Using two people the old-fashioned way is still the best, but I found I
couldn't always find someone who understood not to let off the brake
until I was ready.

I've always been curious about the pressure-bleeder systems that require
an air source. Anybody have experience with those?
