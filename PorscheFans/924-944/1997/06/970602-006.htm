Check out PowerHaus in Tempe, AZ.  Their web site is http:/www.powerhaus.com 
They have some very nice bolt on pieces for the 968 which I am planning on 
putting on my car.  They claim it gives the car 272 HP at the rear wheels. 
 Their prices are also cheaper than the prices you are showing.  Talk to Chris.
