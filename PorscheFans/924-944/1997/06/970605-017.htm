Dear Porsche Plebe:

I think you will get a resounding "YES" to your question about the
worthwhileness of joining PCA.  It will probably be the best $36 a year you
can spend on yourself/your car - but only if you take the time to be
involved, not just read PANORAMA.  I joined PCA 2 months after getting my
first 944 (in 1983), and since then, I have garnered more friendships and
knowledge than the previous 37 years of my existence.  I took the time to
get active in my region, serving in various capacities such as:  Secretary
(2 years); Director (2 non-consecutive terms); and Membership Chairman
(4-1/2 years).  I have co-chaired different types of events, including
hosting a few "Socials" .  And, as previously posted, have criss-crossed
the country for the past dozen years attending the "Porsche Parade" (the
National Convention, spanning a week-long series of events - autoX, rallye,
concours d'elegance, tech quiz, socials).  I have met Porsche people from
all across the country and from many different parts of the world
(including members of the Porsche Family).  A lot of them I see only at
Parade, but it seems as though our conversations pick up right where we
left off the year before.

Do I think joining PCA is worthwhile?
YOU BET YOUR SWEET ASS I DO.

Besides, the sticker is kind of nifty, too.
