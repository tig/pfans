Hi Paul.  I had this problem with my 911.  I bet the 944's are similar.  =
In my case, it was the wiper switch on the column.  When you put the =
lever in the stop position, there is contact made that "tells" the =
wipers to park.  Try gently pushing the lever further in the off =
direction.  This might be enough to touch the contacts.  It worked for =
me, and tipped me off to the problem.

I was able to fix the switch.  You might be able to gently bend the =
contacts so they touch.  In my case I had to glue a little piece of =
plastic onto the cam that pushes the contacts together.  After 90K =
miles, it had worn some.

The intermittent position not working is probably related to the off =
contacts.  Sounds like the 944 has the intermittent on the same lever as =
the wiper on/off, rather than a separate knob like our 911s?  Still, if =
the off contacts aren't made, the intermittent feature will think the =
wipers are on, and not work.

Hope this helps.  BTW, all this talk about 951s and 968s has me curious =
to try one too.  Don't think I could get rid of my Targa, though.=20
