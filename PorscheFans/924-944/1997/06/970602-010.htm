	Hi.
Could it be that the requirement to back off the cam 1.5 teeth once the 
the crank is at TDC is for setting the cam (valve) timing, rather 
than for the tensioning?
It seems to me that as long as the belt tensioner (in my case automatic 89 951)
does not move cam or crank from the set positions, these relative positions
are irrelevant as far as belt tension is concerned. As long as there is 
no slack on the long belt side (between crank and cam gears).
	I am trying to find the reason I get full boost rather late 
(4500 rpm. in the second gear), not in 3xxx range as others indicate.
I get this boost very near WOT, in other throttle positions 1.2 bar. 

1. May be by backing the cam gear by 1.5 teeth (effectively advancing
valve timing) the car will get a better low end?

2. That should reduce my lag?
This car is not tracked so low end response is also important to me.

In my other non porsche turbo car, the engine management computer (EMC) does
not let the engine see the full boost up until 3200 rpm (presumably to save 
the transmission from all that torque, an for smoothness). I can see 
the pressure to open the wastegate building up together with the manifold
pressure. An effective air valve that opens up at 10psi solved that 
problem. Once opened, it allows EMC to take over the normal control of 
the boost. I get 5 psi at 2000rpm, and full boost below 3k. These boost
numbers at such low rpm have something to do with turbo sizing, however 
the point here is that Chrysler limited the boost build up rate. 

3. Could Porsche be doing the same?

What is your opinion/experience ?

	Thanks for your patience Len.
