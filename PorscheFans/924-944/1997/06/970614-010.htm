While I cannot speak knowledgeably on what process is used in Nikasil
coating of cylinders, I am reasonably sure it is not the same process as
used to prepare the cylinders on a 944 engine.  I believe that a coating
would be defined as something that is applied on top of (and bonded to) the
aluminum cylinder wall.  My understanding of the 944 block is that it is
cast using a very high silicon content aluminum.  Then it is bored and
honed in several steps using a special paste until the cylinder walls have
been etched sufficiently (the paste contains some sort of acid, I presume).
The etching preferentially dissolves aluminum from the alloy at the wall
surface.  What is left is essentially pure silicon (not silicone) at the
cylinder wall.  Silicon is a very hard substance (main ingredient in
quartz) and so provides a very wear resistant surface for the piston rings
to slide on.  This process is presented in minute detail in the 944 Factory
Workshop Manual.  

I have had occasion (unfortunately) to require a re-bore on my 944's block
(blown head gasket/scored cylinder, etc...) and installation of larger
pistons.  There are very few shops equipped to do this properly and it
ain't cheap (cost about $400 back in 1989), but it can be done.  The engine
now has 95,000 miles since the rebuild and compression still looks great
(about 150 psi).  Done properly, it certainly is an alternative to buying
another engine.
