That is one solution, Keith, but an irreversible one, and a cat is a fairly
expensive item. Never know when you might move to a state that does visual
inspections.  Plus if the removal makes the car significantly louder, might
be nice to put the stock system back on for a long road trip.  My late '85
was pretty loud w/ a test pipe plus a Bursch cat-back.

But while on the subject, what's the procedure for hollowing out the cat in
a way that leaves it looking reasonably intact and functional?
