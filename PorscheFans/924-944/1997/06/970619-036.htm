Farzaan,

FWIW, I just attended my first auto-x (PCA Acadian Region) last weekend,
7 911's participated along with a 924 and my 951S. One of the 911s was
an '92 911 Targa. He had done a couple of Drivers Ed s and the Bondurant
course and maybe an auto-x. By the 4th run I was down to within a half
second of his best time (1:12). A more experienced driver (the 924) then
took my car out and ran 1:06 besting all by at least a second including
the next fastest tricked out '81 911 SC. This kind of blew away the 911
drivers. They were shocked. All cars were on street rubber. From this
experience I would think that the '92 911 was not as capable given this
weekend's course.

At last year's driver ed the '92 911 was faster but he had had track
time but I had not.
