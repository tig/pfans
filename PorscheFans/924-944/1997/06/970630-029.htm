Well I just got my 89 Turbo back from the shop last Friday.  I had them
replace the head gasket with the Wide Fire Ring gasket as it was seeping
exhaust gases into the coolant system (foamy coolant, but no oil mixing).
The car seems to run good but....

When I got my car back Friday the coolant level was smack between the two
marks on the reservoir.  Today (Monday) it is sitting at the MAX level
after a short 4 mile ride home.  There also appears to be very small brown
spots floating in the coolant tank (oil?).  I have put about 86 miles on
the car since Friday and I have not driven this car hard at all.

One thing that bothers me is that I asked them to double check the head
studs for wear and tear.  They claimed that they could not really check for
stretching, but said in their experience those studs were never a problem
before for them.  I instructed the owner that should he discover a problem
to replace them with Race Wear studs.  They seemed to think that the studs
were OK as they did not replace them.

Do these studs (OEM) have a record of failing?  This car has 107K miles and
as far as I can tell not been raced or beat up.

I wanted to hear your opinion before I make a phone call to the service
shop.  I have marked the coolant level on the reservoir tank and I am
keeping an eye on the oil level as well.

I failed to check the oil when I got it back until yesterday.  It was 1/2
quart low.  I would assume any service shop would (should) top off the oil
after removing and replacing the head, but we all make mistakes, so I can't
claim that the oil level has gone down if I failed to check it upon
delivery.

This whole thing gets me a bit upset as I had just replaced the clutch
(myself, I might add) and not having the belt tensioning tool I decided to
give myself a break and let some one else do this job.  In hindsight I have
paid $800 in labor and two weeks for the garage to complete the job (not to
mention the $230 for the gasket kit).  I could have easily bought the tool
and the Race Wear studs for less and probably got my car finished sooner.
However, I was the one that decided to let some one else do the job.  If I
have to take the car back for another two weeks it will really take away
from my seat time.  I would like to drive it some this summer before the
winter returns. (just being grouchy).

Any thoughts?

Marv
