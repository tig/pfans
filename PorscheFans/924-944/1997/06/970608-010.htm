Making a bastard child out your car will only complicate the conversion.
What is more, investing large sums of money into your car will not allow
you to sell it for anything like what your investment would be.  You will
also get stuck with your insurance company should you wreck the car.  The
book value of a 87 944S is less than the cost of the conversion!  Let alone
your time invested.  It is true you can have the car insured for more value
(and premium payments), but I think you are in for an argument with your
insurance provider.

I will not be one to argue if you are one of the lucky few that happens to
posses more money than you can find things to spend it on, but if that were
true you probably own a GT1 or at least a Turbo 4S, forget those cheap
water cooled toys.

You can buy a used 89 944S2 for about $10,000 and you will need to do a lot
less work on the car.  Or, just buy a Turbo for $10,000 and chip it (250
hp+).  You will have more drive time and less time under that car.

Your statement "I have no idea of what I should do other than the fact that
I want 250-300+hp out of the next engine I install" means to me that you
want a car with more power.  Is this true?  Could you mean that you just
want to have a fun project to funnel cash into?  If the former is true,
then I would opt at looking at another car (either a S2 or a Turbo).

To satisfy my power cravings I bought a 89 Turbo (250 hp) and still have my
87 944 (my girlfriend wants it) and my pristine 87 944S (55,000 miles).
The S is a nice car, but the turbo is far nicer.  Go for some test drives.

Also, installing a V6, or V8 will disturb your weight balance of the car.
Bringing 250 hp under the hood (with whatever engine) demands upgrading the
suspension, brakes, and wheels as well.  For the brakes, this means the
complete front end must be changed (new spindles, hubs, rotors calipers).
If you install the 968 engine you may need to either change the flywheel
(check on this) or use a complete 968 drive train.  I know of conversions
for the Turbos that swapped out their 5 speed gear boxes for the 968 6
speed required the 968 bell housing, torque tube, drive shaft, and
transaxle.

You may want to consider a new transaxle to handle the load of that extra
power.  I would recommend the 968 as the first choice as it has the shift
points in all the right places, assuming a 968 power plant up front, for
the power band.  The NA transaxle in the 944S is geared way to low for the
968, so trash that transaxle (or sell it) and at least upgrade to something
that will take advantage of the power the engine has to offer.

What condition is the car in now?  Maybe you should just fix it and sell it
(trade it) for the car you want?  I have seen complete heads for as low as
$2500.  Or you could part it out for cash.

I have already looked into such ideas with my 944.  In the end it is too
much work (in my circumstance) and money to justify the project.  I bought
my 89 Turbo for $10,500 and have about another $3,000 in mechanical updates
to get it right.  That car has body stiffening from factory, the special
transaxle with the hardened 1st and 2nd gears, the S4 brakes, M030
suspension, and the ride hight adjustable konis.  You could shoot an easy
$2,000 - $3,000 for the suspension upgrades.  Do you need bigger and wider
wheels, new tires also?  Maybe you could buy a bent 968 and transfer the
suspension, wheels, and drive train, but you still have the problem I
listed in the first paragraph.

Just my thoughts,

Marv
