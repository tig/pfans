Hi Rob,

When you are driving the car, and use full throttle, how much boost 
are you getting? Above 4000 rpm, you should see 1.8 bar on the
boost gauge. Anything less than that and there is a problem.

'pull the turbo apart to see if they can find anything' <- Am I the
only one who got chills from reading that? That sounds like a recipe
for (financial) disaster (your's, not the dealers).

Here are some facts that you might find interesting.

The 944 turbo S model is supposed to make .8 bar (1.8 on the gauge)
max boost. The boost pressure is computer controlled.  If the computer
detects something wrong with a sensor, etc., it will limit boost to .2
bar to protect the engine. This means that if a small sensor is giving
a bad reading, you lose like 100 hp. When you drive the car, and feel
the car is not performing like it should, use full throttle (be careful
not to ram anything) and see how much boost you get. If you get 1.8 on
the gauge, then everything is fine with the turbo. If you get 1.2, then
the computer has detected a problem and is limiting boost. If you get
between 1.2 and 1.8, then there is another problem. The computer thinks
everything is fine, but the system is not developing full boost. That
could be due to a number of things, like a broken vacuum line, or a bad
connection to the DME or KLR controller boxes.

Do some checking on your own before you let the dealer touch this
car. Personally, I would be very hesitant before I let this particular
dealer work on my car. FYI, the computer provides excellent diagnostic
tools to aid in servicing. If the dealer really told you, and really
meant he would 'pull the turbo apart to see if they can find anything'
than he is incompetant. The first thing the service place should do
is run a diagnostic check and see what the results are. It could be
as simple as a cracked vaccum line, or a bad throttle position switch.

Good Luck,
