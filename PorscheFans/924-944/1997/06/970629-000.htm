Same on my '81 924. Vibrates below 1000 RPM, disappears completely above.
Gets worse when fan kicks in (not AC). An acquaintance of mine who is a
mechanic took a quick look at the mounts, and said that there was no way
they were gone. Note that this was only a quick look under the hood, no
thorough under car inspection. Could it be anything other than the mounts,
or could the mounts be shot without showing any signs of it?
