Todd Leen responds,

>>I'm not sure this is contrary to theory.  From physics,
>>the whole mass-spring-dampener system will equilibriate fastest
>>when it's 'critically' damped.  More damping than this and the
>>response slows down, less damping and the body roll (and weight
>>transfer) overshoots and rebounds before it equilibriates -- so
>>the response slows down again.
>>
>>Does anyone know if shock adjustments typically straddle this
>>critically damped point (which depends on spring stiffness and
>>roll inertia -- so "typical" is ambiguous)?
>>
>>To physics, add the driver  -- maybe the ideal is to have
>>weight transfer equilibrate on the order of the driver response
>>(or 'perception') time, rather than as fast as possible.
>>
>>Comments anyone?  I'd welcome a discussion of this.

My .03 (inflation, you know)

I sure hope that if/when this discussion takes place I have my dictionary
handy, so that I can look up all of the techno-jargon (ie. "equilibriates",
"ambiguous", "perception")
