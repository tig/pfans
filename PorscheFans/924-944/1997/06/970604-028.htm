This problem affected 83 & 84 944s. It was usually remedied at the time
by Porsche service centers by tapping holes into the air intake pipe
leading up from the wheel well. If you are too worried you can always
fit a K&N filter directly onto the throttle body.

I understand there is a problem with the air intake tube located in the
driver's side front wheel-well of an early 944.  Apparently, there is a
risk
that water may be "sucked-up" by the tube when driving in rain, causing
many problems (including hydrolock).  Can anyone verify this design
flaw? If the location of the air intake tube is a problem, how can it be
remedied? I read that the entire PVC tube which runs from the wheel
well to the air filer box can be removed.  Is this safe?  Any input
would
be appreciated.

Also, does anyone have any suggestions about the best place to install
an amplifier on an early 944?

Thanks,
