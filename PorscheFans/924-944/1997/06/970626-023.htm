My fan switch also just went out in speeds 1, 2, and 3 but works in
position 4.  Kevin, were you able to fix yours?  How?

When the fan went out, I turned on the defrost to see if the fan speeds
worked with defrost; they did not.  Then I turned the defrost off, and the
hot air continued to flow even when I turn on the air conditioning.  It's
like the heater shut off valve is stuck or something.  Has anyone else had
this combination of probelms?  Thanks.

Well my car suffered from the same problem some time ago. Very annoing!.
I cured the problem by just cleaning the overheat/fire-prevent switches on
top of the resistors that are switched serial to the Fan and the
fanspeedswitch.
I cleaned them with Magnetic Tape Head Cleaner and a contactfile.
The part with the resistors is located at the right side of the airintake,
under the plastic cover (Next to to fusebox). It has a connector on top. It
is simply to reach and remove. Make sure you do the cleaning all-right, the
resistors become very hot and you don't want to end up with a burned-out
944. If you don't like wwhat you see, buy a new resistorbank to be on the
safe side.
I added two pictures to illustrate.
If this all is still in time, let me hear if things works out.


Have fun, Ruudje.
1988 944, 1994 750SS, with nothing for towing if they break down.
