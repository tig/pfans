Hell it's not which porsche is better, it's which porsche is right for the
person who is going to be driving the car. We all know that all three of
these porsche's are great cars even though one car may have some stronger
points here and weaker elsewhere. It all boils down to what the drivers
needs are, not just whether or not it can do the 1/4 in 12 secs.
