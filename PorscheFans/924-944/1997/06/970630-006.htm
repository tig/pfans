Hi all,

When I use my A/C in my car '89 951 it eventually blows the 7.5 amp fuse (#29)
for the heating and cooling.  Usually what happens is that I press the A/C
button and the fuse blows immediately.


Unfortunately, this seemed to coincide with another problem.  When it rains,
water will dribble down my left leg (and no, I don't need depends).  I think it
is coming from the driver side air vent.  It doesn't dribble constantly, it
comes out at about a cupfull at a time (i.e. as if something opens up and lets
the water in, then shuts, then opens again...)

I'd like to remove the leaves that are currently near the intake vent and see
if some drainage passage is blocked.  How do I remove the plastic cover that is
over the fresh air intake?

Any insights?

thanks
