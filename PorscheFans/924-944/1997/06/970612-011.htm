Hi P-fans,

I am glad we are getting lots of interest in the 968 lately on the
P-list. I have bought my first Porsche in late January 97.
It is a 92 968 coupe black on tan first put on the road in sep 93 32,000
miles. I just love the way this car drives .
I had losts of experience with other good german cars 85 Merc 300 E, 87
BMW 318i, 92 BMW 325i, European (230bhp no cat) 87 911 Carrera Cab, 89
911 C2 Coupe, 91 911 C2 Cab.
I thought the C2's would be much more powerful. My favourite sound was
the 87 911 Cab with the top down flying down a windy country road in
England.   
Coming back to the 968, not only is it a great fat 4 cylinder but it
has  torque from way down the rev range and the variocam just opens up
past 4,500 rpm. Power sliding out of 90 deg turns in 1st (skinny BF
Goodrich 225/50/16 on the rear, if they last 7000 miles it will be a
miracle), more power sliding with the rear switching from left to right
in 2nd gear under controlled throttle in the rain.
This car gives you lots of warning before it slides from the back and
when it does it it the easiest thing to bring it back or just steer with
you right foot.
It is an amazing car 50/50 weight distribution, with the classic front
engine rear drivetrain layout. The fist weekend I bought it I clocked
350 miles showing it to my friends all city miles, with lots of 0-60
runs. Any P-fans living in Montreal you will definately have noticed me,
the only Porsche to drive year round. just stick on winter tyres and go.
On top of that fewer that 13000 were ever produced with less than 5000
coming to North America. It looks like the 993 from the front and
whenever peaple say, "oh I never heard of it" I just tell them it is one
of the rarest production Porsches and it kicks butt. 

Just wanted to share my thoughts with the P-fans. got to go wash the car
and cruise this week end, it's formula one grand prix week end.

Go Ferrari ( hey there are no Porsches to cheer and Villeneuve will
definately win so might as well cheer the scarlet red Ferraris than a
Renault, if only you saw the Ferrari fans go completely wild the last
time Alesi won two years ago you'll understand).
