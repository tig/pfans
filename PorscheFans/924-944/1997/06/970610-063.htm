Well, back in the early 80's, I added a 924 turbo spoiler to the rear of 
my 924.  This can be done but you must be careful when you drill the 
holes in the rear window frame.  I don't have any pictures though.  The 
spoiler was similar to the 944 spoiler and I took the center piece, 
drilled the correct hole for the center most screw just beyond wear the 
glass stops.  Then using an old screw as a scribe (cut-off head and grind 
to a point on that end) I incrimentally made marks around the frame as to 
where the next screw holes lined up.  If I remember right, I had to make 
some short pieces of aluminum to substitute the connections on the sides 
where both the side pieces meet the center piece.  Maybe I just didn't 
get these pieces or I couldn't drill the appropriate hole in that 
area....I don't remember.  But it was possible.  And I sure like the 
soft/hard rubber tails over the fiberglass replicas.  don't know why you 
couldn't do the same to the 944 spoiler.  The 968 spoiler might be a 
different challenge.  Can't speak of that.
