<< I'd like to find a bra for my 951.  Anyone have a good one? >>

I just put a new Colgan bra on my '84 944 and it is a PERFECT fit.  However,
I did take a lot of time with the installation to make sure that all seams
were lined up and the clips were bent properly around the body panels.  I got
the one with the separate headlight covers from Automotion during their sale
last month (the bra and mirror covers were about $89.00).

I know some owners on the list have said they were not happy with the Colgan
bra but this one looks great and it fits nice and snug at all speeds.  IMHO I
think most of the difference between a really nice installation and the other
89% of them is the care and time in the initial fit.

For what it's worth!
