Well, actually quite a few people have done something similar, Porsche
included.  They called it the 968 Turbo, but it never made it to production.
There are a few companies out there that do the 968 Turbo conversion, so I
imagine S2 conversions have also been done.  A fellow list member has
provided me with the name, address, and phone number of one shop that does
perfom the conversion, but it's in England.  I believe there is one in
Australia too(???).  If you or anyone else would like this info, let me know.

Limit compression, and to ensure that the 944 turbo wasn't faster than their
flagship 911 turbo.
