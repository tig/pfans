Hello Andrew.

Horsepower/Torque alone don't make one sports car "superior" to another.  It's
the total package.   I can easily go out and get a V8 American muscle car,
spend couple of thousand dollars on mods and have a smoker, but I chose to
buy a slower, less torquier Porsche instead.  Why?  Well because to me it is
a _pure_ sports car, made for purists who love to drive.  The purism of my
Porsche, of any Porsche, is reflected in the layout of the no frills interior
and the fully functional exterior design - you don't really see anything on the
car that does not serve some useful purpose.  Can't say the same for the muscle
cars - what are those side air body vents in front of the rear wheels on
mustangs for anyway?  This love of driving is not the same as the "hey, look
how fast I can go and I can kick your butt" attitude commonly found in the
muscle car crowd.  It's just as much fun to drive a stock Porsche as it is with
many mods done.  I may not be able to beat Firebirds, Z28 Cameros, Saleen
Mustangs, and Corvettes (all with their big V8 engines), but the fact that my
little itty bitty 4 cylinder 2.5 Liter turbo charged 11 year old Porsche can
keep up with them is a huge compliment to the engineering and technology that
goes into every Porsche.  Porsches are not made for the masses - muscle cars
are.  Just listen to the opening words in my Porsche owner's manual (something
like):

 "Judging by the car you have chosen, your are a motorist of a unique breed,
  and are no novice when it comes to cars and driving..."

To me, that says it all.

To each his own.  I saw your home page.  Are you for real??  Spending all that
$$$ on mods to your Pontiac!  You could have gotten a nice 1989 951 and spent
several thousand dollars on mods and come out still spending less totally than
you did on your Pontiac and you would have had a real smoker, if that was your
original intent.

How about a 930 that's been through a RUF conversion?  That's a smoker!

Just my opinion here.

1986 Porsche 951, 217 HP, 243 ft/lbs, totally stock, perfectly happy
        with the V8 muscle cars passing me, while I stay on their tails :-)
