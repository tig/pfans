I agree with Barry Lenoble that this is the perfect forum for airing
complaints ie; bad service be known to all. If I was going to spend my hard
earned money (OK not too hard earned) on parts ect, I want to know that a
shop is good or bad. I have had shops who advertise in PCA mags screw up on
my car only to hear later "why did you use them, they suck!" It's simple, if
you own the shop and you know your customers are talking to each other, you
will make sure they are treated right. If Ron felt he was wronged he has
every right to type in this forum and "set the matter straight." Porschefans
has been very good about telling consumers who has good prices and good
service, I value this information, and hope it will continue. If it were not
for threads of this nature I would not have ordered from Jason at Paragon
who was great by the way. The saying "caveat emptor" (buyer beware) is now
out dated, we need the Latin for "proprietor beware". Yes I know all you
need is one person who flames someone for the wrong reasons, but I hope
people on this list have more integrity then to do such. Only my opinion,
agree or not.
