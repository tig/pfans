Recently I had the upper pressure duct off my 1980 924 Turbo. After I
put everything back together I started having the following problem.
When accelerating at nearly full throttle, with the boost gauge reading
11 psi, I lose all boost at 4000 rpm.  I don't think this is the rev
limiter because I can rev the engine to the red line when at rest.
Opposite the boost pressure control switch there is a control line. The
Haynes manual does not show what component this control line is
connected to, or mention what it controls. Also, there is a fitting with
a spring and ball inside, in between the pressure duct and the control
line. This fitting is not shown in the factory schematics. The way this
fitting is attached, there is no way to get a sealed joint. The fitting
in question looks like a close nipple (plumbing term), champhered to
mate to the control line fitting on one end, hexed on the other end for
an allen wrench and also where the spring seats. The steel ball sits on
top of the spring and seats on the fitting in the pressure duct. The
problem is that since this fitting and the fitting in the pressure duct
are both male threads, the single nut that connects the two of them can
not possibly provide an airtight seal. Can anyone provide answers to the
following questions. What is the control line for? Why is the
spring/ball fitting there, when it is not shown as a factory part? Are
there other reasons for losing boost at 4000 rpm such as pop off valve,
waste gate, whatever? I'm baffled. Any help would be appreciated. TIA.
