I have another possible theory for your relay clicking noise.  When my
A/C was recharged I started having the same noise.  The owner manual of
my car listed a certain amount of freon to be used, but the sticker in
the engine bay said less.  Well when I went with the amount listed in
the owners manual the car didn't like to idle much,(the rpm would drop
to zero and then kick back up to about 1500rpm!) and this coincided with
a relay noise eminating from under my dash area.  When we went to the
lower amount specified in the engine bay area the idle smoothed out, but
I can still hear the relay clicking to this day, with only a minor
amount of engine performance drain.

Does anyone know which measurement is right, the owners manual or the
sticker in the engine bay?  WHy would it cause my engine to porpoise
like that?  And finally, before I had the A/C recharged my heat was
always on.  I checked out that little valve in the back and it works
OK.  My question is the heat still on, and is my A/C working against the
heat.  My A/c doesn't get ice cold, but it does take the edge off.  I
live in Daytona Beach Florida so this is something I deal with daily. 
TIA.
