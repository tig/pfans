Hi Todd.

At first none of the ramps I found would fit under the nose, but then I found
a ramp manufacturer who also makes ramp extensions that clip right on top of
the regular ramps, specifically for lowered vehicles.  It will clip on the
truck or car version of their ramps and extends the length of the ramp by
about 3 feet making the angle at which the vehicle first gets on the ramp
very soft.

I can't remember the name of the company, but the ramps are bright yellow
in color and the ramp extenders are heavy duty plastic red.  Ramps were about
$18.00 from Pep Boys, and the extenders were about $20.00 from Autozone.  Both
are made by the same manufacturer.  I'm sure Western Auto would have them also.

The general consensus of those who responded seems to be it's OK to raise a
car up in this fashion, i.e., one side at a time, with no adverse effects on
the wheels, tires, frame, etc.
