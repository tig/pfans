I also had a gas smell in my car but it was because of a leaky vent hose. 
Yes the trans axle has to come out.  It isn't that hard.  Before you start
please read the threads about the CV bolts and make sure you use the
correct tools for removal.  Once you get the tank out I recommend you
change the vent hose (on newer models it goes to the charcoal canister.  It
would be a shame to have to take the tank out for again for a hose that is
just a couple of bucks.)  The Haynes manual is pretty good on how to get
the tank out.  I would do it right away.  Gasoline vapor is EXPLOSIVE!
