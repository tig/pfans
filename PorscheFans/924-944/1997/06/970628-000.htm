Bob,
The chips are Superchips inc. They are 6 months old. Mileage is 111k.
The bar indicator on the dash just pegs out at 2 bar. I installed an
Autometer boost gauge to find the actual boost. I am not using 17lbs at
all times. It takes about 2500-3000rpm to build to this level. I have to
keep the throttle fully open to get this level of boost. I do not do
this at every green light however. Currently I am thinking of a way to
put the adjustable valve in the car, it is now under the hood.
When I drive normally I rarely go over 5-7lbs. Also Before Shutting the
engine down I let it idle for at least a minute to get old oil out of
the turbo. By the way what DME problems are you talking about?
