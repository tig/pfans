Hello All,

I have a new noise that started 2 days ago and I fully believe it is the
right outer CV Joint.  Interesting thing is that it came on all at once
and is very noticable (loud) but has gone away at times for 20-30 miles
or so only to return.  It is a typical sound of a bad CV joint.

It appears that the two joints on a given axle are identical.  The FAQ
on CV joints mentions swapping the joints so they run in reverse
direction to extend their life.  

My question is that if the joints are identical why can,t you just turn
the whole shaft assembly around which would reverse rotation without
having to remove the joints from the shaft.

I am tempted to clean the joints and repack them with fresh grease,
reinstalling the shaft in reverse and see what happens.  If the noise
reappears then I will have to replace the joint.  I,m only out a little 
grease and some skinned knucles for trying.

Thanks much,

George Mouer
