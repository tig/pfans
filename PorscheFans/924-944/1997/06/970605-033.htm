No Japanese sport cars! No soul, no feeling, no style. They look bad after
a few years, if they don't already look bad now. The 944 is a good looking
car after 10 years, should still look good in 20.

That said, you probably should buy an 85.5 or later 944 NA and a cheap
Japanese car, like a dented $1,5000 Toyota Celica or Mazda 323.

The reason I say this, is that, I have owned a 1987 944 as my sole ride for
a year now. The enemy of this car (IMHO) is the get home from work, park
the car, it cools, you need to run to the grocery store (very short trip)
and come home again. It cools, but then you drive to the bar down the
street (very short trip), it cools. You get social, and drive home. That's
like 4 cool/heat cycles a day, and three of those heat cycles were not even
full operating temp.

I think these super short trips are no good for the car, and if you had
another car to unload those crappy trips on, your 944 will love you even
more. Also, you can avoid rain and it's increased chance to wreck or be
wrecked.

I have my eyes set on a 1976 Mercedes 240d. $1500. Perfect second car. It's
even a diesel! Hardly no maintenance.

As far as owning two cars, I'd say you'll definitely spend less on
maintianing the 944 if you reserve it for longer more involved trips. The
insurance company will give you a multi-car discount. Tell them the cruddy
car is your main ride, and the 944 is your sunny day driver, and you don't
expect to put many miles on it.

The final plus! You have a car to drive while you work on your 944! If you
do any of the work yourself, it takes considerably longer, but no matter,
you have a car to drive.

+ + +

That said, you can get away with the 944 as sole car. They are reliable,
and no doubt a joy to drive. They are not stoplight racers and will feel
slow 0-30, but 30 to 110 is yours, and you get great handling at all speeds.
