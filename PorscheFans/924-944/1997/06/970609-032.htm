I haven't had any trouble with Ron either.  It was kind of hard to get a hold
of him, however once I did get a hold of him I didn't have any trouble getting
parts.  (I bought a new water pump from him)

After trying numerous other places to get a new water pump (dealers,
Euro-products, etc...) I couldn't find a brand new water pump.  Ron had a
distributor that carried the water pump.  I got the water pump in a timely
fashion.

He was a nice guy to chat with, and was knowledgeable about porsches (I think
he owns an '87 carrera).

However, I don't think the mail order company is his day job.  The only time I
could really reach him was at night.  With that in mind, yes there might be
problems ordering him if he does have another job.



Does anyone else have any other info on Euro-speed?
