Lighten up, Farzaan. Sounds like you're going thru an insecure phase, your
identity is getting too wrapped in your car, and you're depending on other
peoples' opinions to tell you what to drive.  Everyone feels your car needs
more personality?  Come on! What is it that YOU want out of a car. Doesn't
seem like you're concerned about making good runs on the track anymore.
There's no end to the path you're on now.  You're getting dangerously close
to becoming a shallow snob. Pull out of the dive before you have me
thinking that I can't really be content until I get a 911 too.

Flip side. Relax. Drive the C2. If you like it, get it. No biggie. 

Anyway. Enough preaching. For what it's worth, I recently had a great price
on an excellent '86 Carrera.  Decided to keep my S2 because I happen to
like driving it more than the 911. Don't get me wrong. That black Carrera
was a beautiful and serious machine.  But it's not the only "real" Porsche.
