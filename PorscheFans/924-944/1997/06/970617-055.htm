Wes,

I have no idea.  I order my timing belts from Porsche, because for a buck or 
two more, I have someone who will stand behind damage from a bad part.  This 
is one part where that matters a lot!  I don't remember who makes the S belts 
for Porsche these days, was Pirelli but I think they sold off the business to 
someone else.

Kevin

Hi Kevin, is there a way to tell by looking at a belt if it's of Kevlar? I
ordered the p/n you reference above from Automotion and got a belt made by
TRW and Federal Mogul of Switzerland, the TRW p/n 48-30594. I thought it
was a good deal at $17.58 during Automotion' 20% off sale.
