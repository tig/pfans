Hi all,
	I have a ?? about performance chips.  I recently purchased an 88 944 
Turbo.  I specifically asked the previous owner if he had chipped the car and he said no.  However, in the glove box of the car was a bag containing some bulbs and fuses and WHAT IS THIS, a box with a chipset in it.  Also, the label on the bag says

AUTOTHORITY PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING
PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE FOR PORSCHE
PART NUMBER:  951.020.200.20
APPLICATION: 944t '86/7 STAGE 2

So, my ?? is....are the chips in this bag the performance chips or are the 
performance chips in the car and these are the OEM.

There are 2 24pin DIP packages.  They have a printed number on them as well as ahandwritten note.

One says DME with number 1267355235
One says KLR with number 1267355138

The numbers are somewhat difficult to read so one or more digits may be wrong.  


Greg;

I just chipped my 88 951 and the DME and KLR chips are in differnt DIP
packages, one is a 24 pin and the other is a 28 (?) pin. The chipset in
the glove box will not fit your car (at least the DME chip won't). 

To make a good guess if your car is chipped or not, stand on the gas in
3rd from about 3k rpm. If the boost gauge swings to 2 bar, you probably 
don't have a stock chipset. If it only boosts to ~1.8 bar, you probably 
still have the stock chips. The only sure way is to peel the passenger 
side carpet back and remove the boxes. The DME and KLR boards are each 
enclosed in a two piece sheetmetal box.  Metal tabs hold the two halves
together, so if the tabs have been pried up somebody's been in there.

Call AutoThority at 703-323-0919 and ask 'em if they will exchange the
chips you have for some that fit an '88. You should also have a banjo
bolt with two copper washers on it to correctly install the chipset.

Good luck.
