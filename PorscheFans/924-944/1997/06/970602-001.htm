I finally found some Mobil 1 75W-90 Gear Lube.  Auto-Zone is a national
retailer for Mobil ($6.99/qt.).  Mobil has some good info on their web site
regarding their products.

Anyway, changing the gear lube was a snap.  It was alot easier than most
cars I've had in the past.  The only tricky part was filling the transaxle
without a pump.  A helpful hint to fill the transaxle - I ran a piece of
1/2" hose over the left rear wheel, over the muffler and into the
transaxle.  Then I placed a funnel into the hose and filled the transaxle.
I knew the capacity is 2.75 qts. so after 2.5 qts I kept an eye on the
transaxle for fluid starting to overflow.  I still had the pan under the
transaxle so I let the little bit of gear lube run out into the pan and
replaced the plug.

The gear lube that came out look really good.  I went back to my records
and found the ticket for a 60k mile service.  It didn't have anything
listed under labor for changing the fluid but it did have 3 qts. of Swepco
gear lube listed under parts.  A huge sign of relief since I initially was
under the impression the fluid had never been changed.
