True, but then again there _are_ cars that feel more confident and solid
than 944s. Dont mistake me, I love my 944 (especially the looks and the
handling) but compared to the various Mercedes-Benz cars I used to drive
it's definitely less solid. I once had a 1984 280E with 250K miles on it
that was completely free of any rattles or even small defects.  Just
compare the dash switches of a Benz with those on a 944, the Benz switches
look and feel if they are made to last a hundred years. What I also loved
about My Merc was the uncomplicated design, low maintenance costs, the
'safe feeling' and the incredible smoothness driving it. I really have a
lot of fun blasting around in the 944 but in terms of quality and technical
design it does not even come close to what I was used to.
