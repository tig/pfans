Hi all -

Well, the transmission is out and apart.  Or at least the differential 
side plate is off.

What I found is a carrier that has broken at both points on the ring gear
side and one point on the opposite end.  Suprisingly it didn't crack at
the pin/dowel location through the spider gears.  The first comment the
mechanic asked me was where I was hiding the V-8!  Guess those speed
shifts and 2-1 downshifts have taken their toll.  There are signs of the
cracks having been there for a while and then of course major failure over
the weekend.  The ring and pinion look to be in good shape; no sign of
damage and very little metal in the bottom of the case.  All of the damage
is limited to the spider gears, side plate cover (which is in about five
pieces) and of course the carrier.  Haven't really looked at the bearings
yet. 

So the decision, do I buy a rebuilt/used transaxle or do I repair it.  A 
friend has a complete carrier from his transmission (price?) when he put 
in a limited slip.  Kevin and George, what do you have available for a 
'86 NA car?  Anything with a limited slip in it?  Or do I repair it and 
at what cost?  Sure would be easier to just install another transaxle.

Thanks for everyones suggestions and help.
