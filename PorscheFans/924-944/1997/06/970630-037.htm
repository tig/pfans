It is hard to deny the nice feeling knowing everything on your 944 is
working, 100%.  With that in mind, I decided to fix two niggling
annoyances I'll share with the list. 

1.  The horn.  One of the twin tone horns decided to quit a few weeks ago,
so I finally got around to fixing it.  Just one horn does not command the
attention needed in an emergency (someone almost plowed into the left
fender a few days ago - she heard the horn at the last moment). 

After determining which one was not working, I removed and disassembled
it. Use some penetrating oil on the little screws, they will be a bit
rusted, and I broke one off.  The affair is quite simple, a pair of
electromagnets and contact points, which are connected to a diaphragm with
a metal bar. The magnets pull the bar, which breaks the contact, then
returns to close the contact and repeat the cycle.  This cycle happening
several thousand times a second vibrates the diaphragm.  My horn was open
circuit, so I figured I just needed to clean up the contacts and be on my
way.  However, the contacts have an adjustment bolt (7mm) outside the horn
(no need to disassemble, I found out later).  It is sealed with a bit of
glue.  I found that turning that bolt a quarter turn or so clockwise
returned function to the horn. Something must have slipped or the contacts
wore down to the point of not conducting.  Try this before buying a
replacement!  If you do find you need to take the horn apart to examine
the contacts, mark both halves so you reassemble it correctly. Be sure the
metal bar attached to the diaphragm is positioned above the electromagnets
when you reassemble, or the horn will never work! 

2.  The driver's door would make a loud snap when opened all the way.
Annoying and embarrasing on nice cars like ours.  Sounded like an old
Toyota!  I assumed the door check stop needed to be lubricated, but I
discovered its mount to the door was loose.  Tightening two allen screws
solved that one.  Fortunately the screws had not backed out all the way
and become lost forever.  I had initially removed the door speaker in an
attempt to lubricate it from the inside.  There was a reddish rubber
gasket that had almost slipped off the end of the check rod - I had to
reposition mine so it sat between the end of the stop and the mount on the
door.  It makes more sense when you see it.  It cushions the door stop
when you open the door all the way.
