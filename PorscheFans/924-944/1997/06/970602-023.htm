I'd like to throw in some personal observations on strut replacement. I
used to be a tire technician in a tire warehouse-type shop, which did
plenty of suspension work, so I got to see the mechanics doing plenty of
strut replacements.

To compress the springs after removing the struts from the car they
actually had a very impressive and safe-looking bench on wheels which
had a spring compressor on one end of it; they could wheel it over to
the car, lay both strut assemblies on the bench, and do them both right
there. The compressor was a solidly mounted frame, and had a guard that
swung down after the strut was in place to catch the spring (if
necessary). The compression was applied by hooks that swung in from the
side and were pushed down by one big hand crank on the top, no wrenches,
very safe and in control. Probably Snap-On or Matco issue, and very
expensive, but worth it if you're doing that many struts!

They usually used a big pipe wrench to remove the nuts holding the strut
inserts in, for convenience, leverage, and adjustability.

Also, sometimes if an oil strut was blown, the inside of the casing was
filled with oil that had become "liberated" from inside, so be
forewarned when opening strut assemblies that they may spread a large
pool of oil in your garage!

I'm going to have to do my struts one of these days...
