The 968 Turbo had the 8 valve turbo motor in it.  Porsche said they had
heat problems with the 16V head.  The cars are were not imported to the
US, but there are some in Canada.  I have heard rumors about companies
turbocharging the 16V motor, but have never seen one.  Even the '968
Turbo' cars run at PSR (formerly IMSA) races were 951 conversions.
