Well mine is an 82 but I think I might me able to help.  
The line is to the wastegate.  I've had mine apart a couple of times.
Just for reference... is this the fitting in the Hayes figure 4.3 item 2?
If so mine is just threaded into the casting and the line hooks up to it.  
I don't believe mine has anything in it (ball or spring).  Just a 
male/male fitting I think.  Also the factory manual has no reference
to a check or anything.

It's possible that you have a leak under pressure.  Will the boost hold
ok if you hold say 8 psi continuously till red line.  If so, I'd look at the
large o-ring on the turbo outlet #43, the gasket #16, or the connection #14
Mine actually has an o-ring here also with a large single barrel throttle.
