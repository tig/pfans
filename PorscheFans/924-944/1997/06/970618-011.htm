Open the hatch and pull away the carpeting. You should see the lock
mechanism. If the two rods going from the center lock to the two pin locking
mechanisms that hold the hatch down are not moving, I guess you have to
change the mechanism. I guess you can see where the problem lies once you
take a look.

The springs on these things can be changed individually. Try AutoAtlanta,
Tweeks, Automotion or Performance Products..

Hmm.. Have you checked the relays? I think there is one for the intermittent
function..

Does this happen when the car is warm as well? On my 924, there is something
called a cold start valve. I think this stops the engine from firing up on
the first couple of revs, to let the fuel accumulator get loaded with fuel
before starting the engine (I'm no mechanic, so if this is wrong don't yell
at me :).  I don't know about the 944 though.
