I have got a lot of email asking about the K27S turbo on my car.  First of
all the K27S is just the stock turbo housing with different impellers.  A
true K27 is a larger turbo which also requires adaptive hardware to install.
 Here are my thoughts on the K27S:

The K27S turbo and chip have a mix of results.  On the low end the car is
slower, but once the revs get above 4000 there is more power.  The turbo has
the same intake and exhaust housing just the impellers were changed.  The K27
chips form Autothority were an uprade from their version one software, I
think my charge was only $100 - $150.  The price to convert the turbo was
about $500.  I had to rebuild it anyway so I went with the K27S option.

Performance:  My car will run even with a new C4S from 40 to 140 mph.  The
C4S has 282 HP so I would say my engine is in the same range.

I would not do the conversion again.  I think the stock turbo with the stage
two chips is the best setup.
