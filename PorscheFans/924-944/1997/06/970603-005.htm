Hi Kids,

I think it was Tom Pultz who just posted saying according to the
Mobil 1 web page Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lube was not a good thing
for our transaxles.

I read the same information and was a little confused, since I have
been using that lube in my LSD '88 951 for a couple of years with
good success in both street and track driving. I like the way it
smooths the LSD operation and shifts easily when cold.

I called the Mobil 1 technical support desk down the road in Fairfax,
VA and taked to a helpful guy there. His general comments were that
the "high pressure sulphur-phosphorus" additive package in Mobil 1
synthetic gear lube was potentially corrosive to bronze bushings which
might be in a transaxle or transmission. Other than that he said there
would be no problems.

He also told me that a GL4 lubricant would have about 1/2 the additive
package as the GL5 Mobil 1 but would not be suitable for use in an LSD.
He said the additive package required for smooth LSD operation with a
GL4 would effectively turn the lubricant into a GL5.

My questions for the list: 

1. Do these transaxles have bronze bushings?

2. Does anyone (Kevin?) have experience with the inside of one of these
   transaxles after it has been run with a GL5 lube?

Doug
