Supporting the notion that lifting one side at a time is safe on the 
suspension, the force vector on the wheels while cornering at 0.8 G's of 
lateral force is actually 1.281 G's at an angle of 51.34 Degrees, which would 
only be obtainable in the garage by increasing the vehicle weight by 28.1% 
while jacking one side of the vehicle to a height of 1.25 times the distance 
between the tires, at which point the car would roll over onto its roof (or 
into the side of your garage), and even then, the suspension would still be 
ok, but you sure would have some body work to do...

Happy Jacking..

Ezra

P.S. I also use a floor jack to lift one side at a time in order to place jack 
stands. Works fine..
