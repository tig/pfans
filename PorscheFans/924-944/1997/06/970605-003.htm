I'd like some help diagnosing 2 symptoms which I think are manefestations of
the same problem - because they began rearing their ugly heads at exactly the
same time.

One morning, after a cold start, the engine started right away but after 3 or
4 seconds, suddenly dropped to about 400 rpm's, spat, choked, sputtered,
coughed and wheezed for about 3 or 4 seconds, then jumped back up to 1000 rps
and did fine.

Once it got warm, however, I noticed the idle was 1,200 rpms, instead of the
typical, consistent 1,000 rpms.

Over the course of the next three weeks, the problem seemed to be getting
gradually worse.  It got to the point I had to intercede w/ the throttle,
slightly, when cold starting, just to keep it from dying.

Then I put in a chip, and the cold start rough idle went away (richer mixture
maybe?).  It still idles at 1,200.  Yesterday, after two weeks w/ chipset and
smooth idle, it started the rough idle, 500 rpm wheezing episode again.

Any ideas?

TIA,

Jeff Fortenbery
