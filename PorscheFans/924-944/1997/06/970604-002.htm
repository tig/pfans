<<I have an 87 944 na with the Koni yellows that has been autox for 2
years. The fronts are mostly set at 1 turn off full hard.  I tried
almost full hard on the rears and got wheel spin (no lsd at that time)
in big 180 turns.  Changed the rear to full soft and things got better. 
Added a stock lsd and am thinking about firming the rears up a little.>>

I have to mildly disagree with Andy on autocross shock settings for the
NA 944. As delivered from the factory the 944 has a decent amount of
understeer, particularly on slow-speed tight turns as typically found on
autocross courses. Unless you are setting the car up for a Street
Prepared class where you can properly resolve the problem by using
larger torsion bars to decrease the 'push', you are forced in the stock
classes to use toe-out, softer front shock settings vs. harder rear
shock settings, and uneven tire pressures. Using toe out is a real pain.
It will eat up tires on the highway so you must change it at the event.
Using uneven tire pressures is a last resort. 

If you are using the Koni gas adjustable shocks (you can tell by seeing
if there is an adjustment mechanism at the top of the front strut) and
you want to help combat understeer, I'd set the rears to 1 setting back
from full stiff and the fronts at full soft to 1 or 2 quarter-turns up
depending on conditions. Since the fronts can be adjusted from inside
the engine compartment while the rears must be removed to be adjusted,
this give you a way to easily fine-tune your car. I have heard that
premature wear can occur when running Konis at full-stiff.

As Andy mentioned, you *will* get more rear wheel hop and spin
accelerating out of turns. But that is just your car telling you that
the rear is no longer stuck too tightly! The LSD does have a significant
positive impact on this tendency, and I'd highly recommend using one.
Unfortunately, it does induce more understeer...

(Found out this weekend that the '89 Turbo comes with the Koni gas
adjustable shocks as standard equipment - Cool!)
