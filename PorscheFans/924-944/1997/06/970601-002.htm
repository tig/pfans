It lives, it breathes, and rolls on its own power.  This was a large
improvement over the last time it did so on its own power.

It was exactly one month ago (4-30-97) that my 89 Turbo failed.  The clutch
self destructed fifteen miles from home and I now look at my $75 dollar
towing bill with that fateful date etched on the yellow paper.  Now one
month later, to the day, the last of the details were assembled late at
night.  I was intent on getting this job done that night.  My pace was
hurried and my attitude was swiftly degenerating to sub-human.  Little
things were taking on the attribute of large annoyances.  "Damn this light"
I curse as I tangle with the trouble light cord.  Now I know why they are
called trouble lights!  My new reclining Snap-On creeper, with those large
casters, would gladly roll over the cord, but it was impossible to get it
to roll back off it.  Tools were getting scattered about.  I bought one of
those Magnetic Tool Creepers at Griot's Garage to hold my tools as I worked
under the car.  It rolls about on four casters so you can easily drag it
around where ever you go.  It works quite nicely, but the Turbo forces you
to use so many tools at once it was hopelessly overloaded.  This job has
taken me so long that I was wondering if the jack stands would leave
permanent marks in the concrete floor.

Finally, at the eleventh hour, I was finished.  The last of the tools were
picked up.  I swept the floor clean, raised the car, pulled the jack stands
out, and lowered the car back to earth.  After a month sitting 24" off the
ground it had began to take on the appearance of a 4X4 truck with a big
lift kit.  Now sitting at its normal altitude it looked quite unfamiliar.
I reinstalled the spark plugs, attached the ground lead to the battery and
did a last check for wayward tools.  Some thing told me to grab a fire
extinguisher from the kitchen.  I grabbed two and placed them on either
side of the car.

I opened the door and the over head dome light obediently shined.  I seated
myself behind the wheel, eyed the cockpit; the shifter was in neutral,
check.  Hand brake on? Check.  I turned the key to the first position.  No
smoke!  Go for position two...  All the dash lights winked on.  Wow, I had
forgotten how many lights this thing had!  Last thing to do, with the count
down started I turned the key to the start position. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... the
motor started turning.  How long will it have to crank, I wondered.  A few
seconds later the engine started.  We have ignition!  As if the car had not
been sitting more than a day, it lumbered to life.  The engine felt smooth
and eager.  I had forgotten how quiet and sedate this 250 hp engine was.
It belies the beast within.

Now the acid test.  The clutch pedal slid to the floor.  It seemed a little
lighter than I remembered, so I pumped it a few times to insure full
travel.  Gone was that sickly whirring of the failed throw out bearing.  It
was replaced with a smooth silence.  With one hand firmly on the wheel I
disengaged the brake lever, then snicked the gear shift lever in to first
gear.  My right foot kept pressure on the brake pedal just in case.  Dead
ahead were two other 944s in my parking lot.  I needed no victims tonight.
Slowly I released the pedal.  With out fail the car slid forward.  Hey,
this is a good sign!  It was raining out, so I did not have plans for a
test drive, but I did want to move my car so that it took up only one space
in my two car garage instead of two.  The car reversed with the same
perfection as it exited the garage with.  I was confident that I had
succeeded now.  This was my second clutch job and my first Turbo.

This job takes a lot of effort, but there was one trick that I thought I
would share with the group.

Post Mortem:

My clutch showed two signs of failure.  First, several of the small springs
in the clutch disk had cracked and some of the spring material had wandered
away.  Second, I had a very noisy throw out bearing in this car.  I assumed
that there would be no catastrophic failure mode for this part.  WRONG!  My
bearing had split into three pieces.  One welded itself to the bell housing
aluminum tube that attaches where the drive shaft enters.  I used a wheel
puller to yank it free.  The other two major pieces were caught like rings
around the drive shaft between the pressure plate and the clutch disk.
There were errant ball bearings every where as well as metal slivers and
other debris.  Not a pretty sight.  Fortunately, the flywheel was not
damaged as it was covered by the disk.

The moral of the story is to never ignore a noisy throw out bearing.  Get
it replaced before you need the tow.

Tips:

Replace your Turbo clutch with the Sachs Turbo Cup package.

When you try to slip the drive shaft and torque tube into the bell housing,
first slide the drive shaft in as far as it will easily go, then engage the
clutch pedal.  This will free the clutch disk to move as required so you
can get the drive shaft to slip into the pilot bearing.  I also made a
wooden assembly that uses the spare tire scissor jack to support the engine
when the torque tube was separated from the bell housing.  I used the jack
to fine tune the level of the engine as I slid the torque tube back into
the clutch.  You should be able to just wiggle the torque tube from the
rear and slide it into the bell housing once everything is lined up and the
clutch pedal is held to the floor.  I used a stick to keep it engaged.

Also, I used my transaxle adapter to install the transaxle and I can report
that it worked great.  Using the nuts at the ends of the threaded rods I
was able to dial in the fit exactly.  The transaxle balanced perfectly on
the jack and required no intervention to support the transaxle at any time.

Last night I slept.  I was still a little sore, but I slept well!

89 Turbo almost ready for action.  I need new plates and tags.
