Could be a loose ground.  Also, the popping could be from a loose solder
joint inside the amp or radio.  You need to pull the radio and take the
covers off.  Re connect the radio (best done on a bench with a power supply
and speakers) and tap the PC boards with a small screwdriver (butt end
only, do not use the metal end of anything!).  When you get close to the
offending area it will start popping.  You should be able to isolate the
area and you might see the faulty solder joint.  Resolder with a 40 watt
solder iron (Radio Shack) and a small amount of new solder.  If you bridge
a solder joint with a glob of solder, remove it with some "Solder Wick"
(Radio Shack) which is the same thing as some copper braid with rosin
coating.  You need to expand the braid a little, place it over the solder
blob, and heat with an iron.

Do not heat the PC board too much.  3 - 5 seconds should be plenty.  The
joint should be shinny and smooth when done.

Post Script

I will let you know in about 20,000 miles if my 944S needs a head gasket.
