Farzaan--

Good. You sound back in the groove.

I hate to admit it, but I too would like my S2 to sound a bit nastier on
the track, even if an exhaust mod doesn't improve the power.  B&B Fab has
some nice, but expensive, systems for the 944s.  Both a cat-back and a test
pipe. One of my PCA friends w/ a 944S claims he's got a B&B system in which
the test pipe comes in two pieces. The forward piece bolts to the exhaust
manifold and ends just beyond the 02 sensor. The back half attaches to the
exhaust pipe. If the regular converter pipe were similarly modified, it be
convenient to change over before track events - wouldn't have to go thru
the hassle unbolting at the exhaust manifold.

Windward sells some of the B&B products for about half the price quoted by B&B. 

 If you modify the exhaust, let me know what you think.  Time to pay back
those noisy 911 and 914 drivers that give me earaches when I work the
corners.  A few extra hp would be icing on the cake.
