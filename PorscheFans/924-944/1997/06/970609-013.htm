Morning Ezra
I started with Nitrous, because it is the easiest way to real performance
and I did use it conservatively (plus 40hp) in relation to engine life. You
do not need more then 40hp, because in contrast to normal tuning you will
get an enormous increase in torque and that is much more effective then
top-end hp at (to) hight revs.
It is a complex and long story, but worth telling I guess.
First of all, it works perfect, lots of power and torque, easy
installation, bloody fast acceleration.. You have a standard NA
acceleration from the line and at 3000 revs a "turboboost". I used it for
two years and about 30.000 miles. When you are used to it you want to use
it every day and burn a lot of Nitrous. I kept to one 10lbs bottle a week.
Filling your own bottles is very simple. Nitrous in Holland is expensive,
about $4 per lbs. In the States it is much cheaper. If you use it only for
autocross or track events, it's a diiferent story.
I bought mine from NOS ( Nitrous Oxide Systems) in the States. Very good
company, good quality  goodies and instructions. Their basic kit for 4
cylinder EFI systems is perfect for the 944.and not to expensive. To make
it safe you need a rpm switch (in at 3000, out at 5400) and a throttle
switch (only active at full throttle). To make it easy you need a remote
bottle-valve and a bottle heater. This all together is approx. $750.
I put the standard 10lbs bottle behind the passenger seat on the floor on a
custommade baseplate that fit in very tight between the backseat and the
frontseat frame. The hose went out through a hole under the left rearseat
and runs parellel with the fuel tubes under the car to the engine. The
control switches (heating, arming and valve) I placed on a aluminium panel
on the space after removing the ashtray on the center console. I can fax
you drawings if you need them.
My main concern was the European compression ratio of 10.6. Last week I
lost compression on cylinder 3 (after 2 years and 30.000 miles almost daily
abuse). It appeared to be a damaged piston and I have replaced it this
weekend. My engine is now 135.000 miles old (1983) and I blame the problem
on overall age and high compression. In the US you have a compression of
9.5 and that will be perfectly save for Nitrous. I have a standard clutch
and transaxle and had no problems whatsoever. Both are still in exellent
condition. I change trans-oil once a year and engine oil twice a year.  At
the moment I am considering giving my engine a quiet old age untill
retirement, because I switched from autocrossing to touringcar racing. I am
considering selling my NOS system. Perhaps you are interrested?
If you need more info, please E-mail
kind regards
Peter

Peter,
      Could you elaborate on your use of NO2? Being the owner of an NA 944,
it is a very appealing option, and the least expensive to get another
50->80 Hp. How long have you been using Nitrous on your daily driver? What
system do you use? How much does the Nitrous add to your operating costs?
Have you done any engine modifications? etc... I have seen several systems
advertised for ~$500, and the sales people all claim that their systems
don't have any real effects on engine life. I know this isn't true, and
would like to know how the 944 stands up to the extra abuse (engine, trany,
etc..)

Looking forward to your response!

Thanks,
       Ezra
