Has anyone succesfully turbocharged/supercharged the 944S or 944S2 engine
before?  Would the turbo/exhaust manifold off a 944 Turbo model fit?  It
would seem that either would be better a better platform then just a 944
Turbo(or even Turbo S) due to their 16 valves and DOHC.  Plus, the S2 is
already 2990cc so there is no need to throw on a stroker kit. As to
decreasing the compression, I figured a thicker head gasket would do the
trick.  I am not sure about the stock computer though.  The S2 already
puts out 211bhp and with a turbo/supercharger the figure would be much
higher then the Turbo's 247.  Unless there was a reason for Porsche
keeping the turbo model at only 8 valves and SOHC, does anyone know? 

Thanks in advance,

Andy
