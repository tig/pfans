I've been away for awhile.  Quite busy.  Here are some tidbits from my
experience:

If you drive on the track, check your CV bolts frequently.  I have been
fighting a problem with loosening bolts for the past six months.  Twice after
track events, I've had a CV joint let go on the road.  Both time I had to get
towed.  One of the times, several of the bolts had loosened, and two broke
off in the tranny output flange.  Not pleasant.  At Laguna two weekends ago,
I checked the bolts on Sunday morning.  When I did my post-event inspection
on Monday evening, I found ~7-8 loose bolts!.  Check these!!!

If your car backfires loudly on upshifts during heavy throttle (e.g., exiting
a turn on the track, or accelerating har on a fun street drive), check your
factory bypass valve.  Found mine had a blown diaphram after the Laguna event
a short time ago.  The bypass valve is there to help protect the turbo when
you lift.  A reliable source suggested that the 993 biturbo part is "better"
and fits into the stock 951 location.  I will give it a try.

I drove a student's 993 biturbo in mid-May at an AX school.  Lots of fun.
 Being an instructor has merits.  Rode in a 435 BHP 951 a couple of weeks
ago.  This is the car that was described in Excellence in an article written
by David Coleman back in '95.  The article was called "Tempestuous Turbo."
 Well, since that time, the car's owner has sold off all of the Autothority
and HKS stuff.  He had an engine built by Jon Milledge.  It has a Motec
ignition system.  This car was significantly faster than the 993 biturbo.
 Hopefully we'll get David to write a follow-up article so you can all read
more about it.  Milledge did a masterful job.  Next up will be suspension by
Dwight Mitchell (I think).

For those who remember my March-ish posting about a larger oil cooler:

Recall that I bought a larger Mocal cooler to run in series with the factory
unit.  After several experiments, I determined that while it kept my oil very
cool, it restricted too much flow to the radiator.  The cooler I used is
ideally suited for nose-mounting in a 911.  I've decided to sell it...

I just installed a cooler advertised by Terba Tronics.  They make and sell
the popular Terbatrol for 911 cars.  The man in charge there has an Escort
Series 951, and developed a cooler for his car.  (Supposedly there were only
13 of these cars made-- the fastest of the factory racing 951s.  Milledge has
one too I think).

The Terba Tronics cooler is similar in height and width dimensions to the
Mocal unit which I bought, but it is much thinner.  It fits better, and is a
lot cheaper that the racing Mocal unit which I bought.  So far, it seems to
cool the oil without causing too much air restriction to the radiator.  Won't
know for sure until I can run the car hard on a really hot day.

In conjunction with factory cooler and the oil-air separator which I bought
from MIlledge, the Terba Tronics cooler is plumbed entirely with -12 lines.
 The whole packahe adds abot 1 quart of oil (est.)  Although I could have
used at least one of the factory lines, I decided to go with a full -12
braided set-up.  I bought the raw hose from Racer Wholesale.  Their price was
by FAR the best.  Fittings come with both the Milledge separator and the
Terba Tronics cooler, but I bought some special ones anyway for my specific
application.  These aluminum fittings are very expensive, so plan carefully,
and shop hard for the best pricing if you need anything special.  It is not
hard to fab up the hoses-- I bought the recommended soft vise jaws from Racer
Wholesale which makes it easy.

Money-wise, the Milledge kit is $400, and the Terba Tronics kit is $298 (I
didn't need anything but the cooler since I already had had the Mocal
installed).  -12 hose is about $7-8/foot as I recall.  If you want more
details, send me a direct e-mail-- after all of my development work, I can
now get the nose off of my car in less than thirty minutes!
