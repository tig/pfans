My clutch master cylinder was leaking, so I bought a replacement. It arrived 
Wed, and I went to install it Last Night. I jacked the car up (yes, one side 
at a time, and I used four jack stands), disconnected the pedal, moved some 
hoses, used a u-joint and 12mm socket to remove the nuts holding the master 
cylinder to the frame (conveniently placed where it is almost unreachable), 
clamped the feed line, unscrewed the pressure line, maneuvered the master 
cylinder out of the engine compartment (easier said than done), did the 
reverse to install the new master cylinder (really really easier said than 
done), sucked old fluid out of reservoir, filled with new brake fluid, hooked 
line up to bleed nipple on slave cylinder, went to loosen the bleed nipple 
with my little 7mm wrench in hand

SPARKS!!!!

Well, I ignored the Haynes manual, and didn't disconnect the ground lead from 
the battery. I thought, why disconnect the battery, I am working on the 
clutch! Well, of course the positive lead from the battery going to the 
starter is right there IN YOUR FACE below the bleed nipple on the clutch slave 
cylinder, providing a very high current return path to the battery.
Ok, no real damage yet. My craftsman wrench has a little scar, but I am ok. I 
Disconnect the battery, and loosen the bleed nipple, and attempt to pump the 
clutch pedal, slam it goes to the floor. That spring assist was doing it's job 
a bit too well. I pull it back up, push it in, repeat many more times. No 
fluid.. comes out of the clear tube. Ok, so realizing that I need to close the 
bleed nipple after each compression of the clutch master cylinder, and not 
wanting to bother my wife to help me, I proceed to make an adapter to 
pressurize the brake fluid reservoir. I take a lid from a plastic jug that is 
almost the correct diameter, drill a hole through the center, attach a fitting 
and a pressure line, screw the cap onto the reservoir, attach the other end to 
my little Sears 12v spare tire pump, hold the cap on the reservoir with my 
hand, and turn the pump on. The little pump goes chug a chug chug, and
 Whoosh!!!! 
brake fluid flies everywhere! MY paint! My Paint! ok, so the lid wasn't a good 
fit. I brush myself off, and quickly proceed to clean up the mess I just made. 
My SO helped me bleed the system, and it now has clean fluid, and no leaks. Oh 
the joys of owning a PORSCHE. (its worth it, but my wife isn't convinced yet)

So, if anyone out there has a lid that fits the brake fluid reservoir on an 
'86 944, and wants to sell it to me really really cheap so I can make a better 
homebrew EZ-Bleed system, drop me a line! Next time I bleed this #$%^%* thing, 
I want to do it the easy way..

Happy porscheing,
                 Ezra
