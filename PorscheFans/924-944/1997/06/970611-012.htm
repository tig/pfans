If you don't pay your ticket, you'll go to jail.  Accordingly, you could argue
(as a Canadian) that this violates s.7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms, which provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty
and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice". 
Canadian courts have held that the imposition of an absolute liability
offence in penal law offends the principles of fundamental justice and
therefore a law enacting an absolute liability offence (like a photo radar
speeding ticket where you can't argue "it wasn't me") will violate s. 7 if
and to the extent that it has the potential of depriving life, liberty and
security of the person.  Imprisonment surely deprives persons of their
liberty.  A combination of imprisonment and of absolute liability violates
s.7 and can only be salvaged if the authorities demonstrate under s.1
that such deprivation of liberty and breach in the principles of
fundamental justice is a reasonable limit.  See Reference re Section
94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 289.

It's a legally sound argument, but you'll probably have to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada before you'll win.  Otherwise, you're out of
luck.  Swallow hard and pay the ticket.

defend when I dispute in court?"
