Fred:

I had a similar problem with one of my Z-cars, except it had to sit about 20
minutes before it would restart. When warm the engine would start right up,
then die after about 20 seconds. Let it sit for 20 minures or more and it
would start and run fine. The problem turned out to be a gummed up check
valve in the fuel pump. When the car was started it would run on the
residual fuel pressure in the lines for about 20 seconds. When the engine
was turned off the check valve would stick closed, blocking fuel flow,
until it cooled down.

My suggest would be to hook up a fuel pressure gauge and see if you have
pressure while trying to start the car.
