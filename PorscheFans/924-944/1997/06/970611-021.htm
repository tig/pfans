Jay easley had listed as one of the reasons that the 968 did not sell 
well was because most people did not like the headlights. IMHO , the 
frontend of the 968 was the best looking of all the Porsches, including 
the headlights, when it first came out in 1992.  In fact, it was the 
first of the new breed to incorporate the 959 front end look.  The 
993 took its front end cue also from the 968.  Having owned a 914 and 
a 944, I feel those headlights are so out of date, they were first 
introduced in 1970 with the 914. Anyway, the current Panorama issue 
blames the downturn in the economy in 1992 for the poor sales but that 
Porsche had actually expected the same kind of popular reaction that it's 
now getting from the Boxter. According to the engineers at Porsche, the 
standard for handling is the 968, and I can't argue with that as it 
certainly handles much better than my two previous Porsches.  It's just 
too bad Porsche didn't race the 968 as it intends to do with the Boxter, 
but I am glad there are people out there beginning to sniff around the 
968 and playing with it for the track.
