I may not grasp the situation completely, but I do know who AJ Foyt is
(or was).

This is what I think:

Professional racing at top level (NASCAR, f1, whatever) means, among
many other things, checking the car with telemetrics, keeping track of
all competition and generally being informed about just everything...    
If Aries team knew the right number of laps, and could prove it, I think
AJ:s team knew too... In that case they entered the winning circle well
aware that the race maybe wasn't quite over yet.            

That would explain AJ's behaviour (loosing temper and slapping) much
more than anything else. If he had been totally secure, I am sure he 
would have handled it quite differently.      

But, being a professional, he made the most of it, and his sponsors
cannot have been completely dissatisfied.    

Reputedly (this made it all the way into the Swedish television!) AJ
also apologized afterwards. 

To make this slightly 944 oriented, bring this scene along to the next
time you race. Man is a very competitive animal, and our instincts and
reactions may work (just) when competing face to face, naked... Armed
with 944:s it's another thing.   

Regards!
