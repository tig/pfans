I thought about doing this w/ an NA 944.  There are a few possibilties,
assuming you've got an early model. 

Copy the 944 S2 induction system, which places the air filter out in the
nose and was a straight hose to the intake manifold. Maybe couple this with
the 924 Turbo nose panel w/ the two slots. No one I know has tried this, so
the effect is unknown.

Someone at Autothority suggested a ram induction collector at the back of
the hood might be most effective.

European Car had an article on 924 mods in which switching from fuel
injection to 2 (or 4?) sidedraft carbs seemed to boost power. Not ram
induction, but the same general idea.

Get a supercharger. I have no idea if anyone sells a package for the 924,
but the 944 package from Supercharging of Knoxville might come close. Your
compression should be about right for supercharging.
