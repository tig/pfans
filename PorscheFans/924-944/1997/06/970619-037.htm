If that is the VHT High Temp paint, which I believe is 550F, it will burn at
the track.  On my previous car, I got the meatball flag because there were 1-2ft
flames coming out of my wheels.  It took my pit crew (Paul) 1/2 hour to scrape the
peeling paint off the calipers with rocks from the side of the track before I
could go on again!  I ended up using the VHT Flameproof which I believe is 1500F
and that works fine, but doesn't have the same red color.  In the end, what
we ended up using was Bar-b-q paint!  It looks like the same black as Porsche
calipers and lasts a long, long time, it even withstands brake fluid.

There is also a company that sells some sort Lacquer type of paint for calipers
which looks really nice, but I don't know the temp rating or the durability
of it.
