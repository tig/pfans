Ian,
#1 Sell whats left of your S take the 10K you believe you would spend
doing the unthinkable to the S and by a hot 951. 300 easy hp. More fun
than you can point a stick at.
#2 If you want a car with an American engine ( book in for a lobotomy &
) buy an American car.

Richard.

Hello, I have a 1987 Porsche 944 S(twin cam). I had the cam chain
tensioner go out on me and it took out the head, two valves. and the
cams. I had 100,000 miles on the engine and have decided to change out
motors completely. Now my question is, Should i go for the newer 3.0L
968 engine and brain or go (gasp!) american and put in a v6-v8? I have
no idea of what I should do other than the fact that I want 250-300+hp
out of the next engine I install. If you have any suggestions please let
me know because I really dont know what I should do. I do know that I am
looking at $10,000 easy but I can live with that. Thanks, Ian Pellman..
