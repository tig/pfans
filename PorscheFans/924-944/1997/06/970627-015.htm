Yeah, Richard, some good points, particularly if you plan on running  Grand
Prix events.  The Turbo S is definitely a hot car, and the cheapest to get
a lot more power out of.  It might suit my driving style more than my S2,
but if I had the Turbo I probably would have sunk $$$ into aftermarket
performance and blown it up by now.  On the other hand, the S2 and 968 are
just a few mph off the Turbo top end, not that far above in 0-60 times, and
the low-end torque is nice after driving 951s that have nothing below 3500
rpm. That torque is particularly useful on some of the more technical road
courses.  Plus I can work in the front of the engine bay w/out removing a
dozen or so items, don't have to worry about the turbo components going
south or that second crank bearing destroying itself.  There are a few
things to recommend in the S2/968 besides plastic sumps.
