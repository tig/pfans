Yeah, I think replacing the nose panel with the turbo one, plugging off
the other holes in the area behind the nose panel (to make it a complete
airbox) and running a very simple, short piece of ducting from that big
airbox to the existing intake and fuel distributor.

How would this be more effective? I agree maybe on a big American car w/
poor aerodynamics, but our cars have excellent aerodynamics! I don't
think they would have the airflow pattern necessary at the back of the
hood to use cowl induction... Maybe I should get some yarn out and do
some tests... (cowl induction relies on a sort of reverse-flow pattern
at the base of the windshield/back of the hood, caused by airflow
distruption by a hood-to-windsheild transition that is too abrupt, if I
remember correctly)

This is probably only because of the increased choke area. The Weber
big-bore throttle kit should have the same effect if the throttle area
is the same, without the problems of setting up carbs, and at a much
lower price. You could take the extra money and put it towards a header.

My concerns here (aside from the money) would be what to do about
increasing fuel delivery on the appropriate curve. I have the mechanical
fuel injection system (that's the K-Jetronic, right? I always get them
mixed up), so any re-designed 944 chips would be useless for me. I do
have the 8.0 to 1 compression, though :( so turbos or blowers would fit
right on no problem. Does Supercharging of Knoxville have a website?
