Marv,

Based on the indications you gave, I think you are jumping to conclusions.
The coolant level CAN change within the range you mention when things
are pretty normal, and a full blown head gasket will blow BIG bubbles
into the system and pump a lot of fluid overboard, in addition to overheating.

The small oil bubbles in the coolant probably are the result of a small amount
of oil getting into the water jackets during the head gasket replacement.   If
they do not increase, you have nothing to worry about.   You might consider 
draining and cleaning the reservoir and then monitoring the coolant for a while.

I think there is a specification for stud length, but then your conclusion about
their possible stretching seems to be based on the earlier conclusion that
you have blown the gasket again.   Even if the studs were stretched, they
would likely have taken torque successfully and would be very unlikely to
contribute to a zero time failure of the gasket.

We often have a habit of looking extra hard at a car that has just been 
worked on.   Even if you do have a problem, it doesn't sound like an
immediate emergency.   If this car came into my shop, I would want
much more definite indications before going back after the head gasket.

Be cool.   If there is a problem, your car will tell you.

Dave
