> Hi, P-Fans,
> I'm getting ready to work on my brakes next weekend, and I'm having a hard
> time selecting the proper brake pads.  For the next year or so I plan to
> use the car as a daily driver as well as on the track an average of once a
> month.  If I get really hooked on track driving, (okay, hooked more) I'll
> get a different car for daily use and get a turbo 944 for the track and
> deck it all out, but for the next year or so, or until I come into major
> money, hee hee,  I'm going to be learning on this car.
> So my choices are OEM/equivalent brake pads, PBR Metal Master brake pads,
> or Carbon Kevlars.  I'm not happy with the ordinary pads as I have
> experienced moderate brake fade on the track as they get hot.  The PBR's
> are semi-metallics, which reputedly wear out like butter but are marketed
> for autocross use.  My racing instructor buddy recommends the CK's but they
> are three times the cost of the other two pads.  
> Recommendations, opinions, advice?  Thanks, o wise ones.

	Karen, why are you considering only those three pads? You have
	a huge variety available though mail order. Some other pads you
	might consider especially if you're doing track-type stuff are
	the Pagid Oranges, the Performance Friction pads, or the Cool
	Carbons. Bear in mind that track pads leave lots of dust and
	squeal a whole lot. You want to make sure that you find pads
	that are as rotor friendly as possible. Probably the best thing
	to do is try several of these pads out and find the ones that best
	fit you personally. Good luck!
