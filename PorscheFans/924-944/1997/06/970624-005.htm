Recently I posted a problem with my 86 944na not cranking unless the driver
or passenger side door is open.  One of the comments came from Benoy Shah
that appeared to make a lot of sense.  He said:

>My friend had a similar problem.  It had to do with the Seat Belt.  
>Apparently there is a trigger or some sort of switch which might be off

Now I have noticed that I do not have any kind of bell or buzzer go off if
I drive my car without the seatbelt on.  Should I have a bell or buzzer
when driving without the seatbelt (at least right after start up)?  Does
anybody know where the switch is that would control the seat belt buzzer?

Subject: Head Gasket replacement and more pain

Hi all,

Just thought I'd write everyone a note to let them know how much fun it
is to accomplish a head gasket replacement on a 944 turbo.  To be
perfectly frank, it blows.

Some of my observations:

1.  Murphy's laws do apply.

2.  Replace parts even if you think they seem fine.

	- studs stretch...  mine elongated the threads.  This caused the head
gasket replacement in the first place.  It allowed the number four
cylinder to overpressurize the cooling system.

	-  My water pump went out when I restarted my car after redoing the
whole head gasket thing the second time.  So I had to remove the whole
front assembly again.  In short, replace the damn thing.

3.  Do get Raceware studs.  Their technical support is very good. 
However, do not bother getting their extractor/installer tool for
extracting the studs.  It's useless for this purpose.  It would be very
good for installing the new studs.  The Porsche studs and the Raceware
studs have different threads, so make sure you get the one you need.  I
have the Porsche version if anyone wants it...

4.  Helicoils do work.  I had to fix a few stripped threads from Bozo
the mechanic who had my head off last time.

5.  Have your head rebuilt while its off.  Again make sure all the parts
are reinstalled... Right, Steve.

6.  Many people have said the studs are not much fun to remove.  They
aren't, but it is a lot easier with heat.  I used a heat gun I have from
building model airplanes...  Don't laugh it worked.  A pipe wrench also
made a good persuader.  Double nutting also worked.

7.  If you spill copious amounts of oil your car will smoke from many
strange places...

If any one has any questions on this job, feel free to contact me.
