Hi Andrew
I have been using a concealed radar detector for years now and it works
perfect. The only thing you have to consider
is not having any metal parts in front of the antenna that can shield it
from the signal. As most of the front of
porsches is plastic there is ample space for concealed detectors.
regards
Peter

I have a remote radar detector and I just installed the main part of it in
the spoiler. The laser detector is mounted in the center of the windshield
above the mirror and the display is mounted at the bottom of the dash by my
right knee. All-in-all it's invisible from the outside and I've had a
couple of policemen let me go with warnings after they glanced around my
windshield, I assume they were looking for a detector or suction cup marks.
