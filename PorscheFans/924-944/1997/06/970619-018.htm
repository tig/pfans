Of all the plastic covers I have seen for number plates the only ones
I've seen that would work have been made from "perspex" approx 10mm
thick with 10mm wide channels cut through them vertically with 10mm
spacing between them. Dimensions approximate. This has the effect of
being able to be viewed when looked at directly but "blanking out" the
numbers when viewed on an angle. These are cheap to make and are
effective against speed cameras, although if you are pulled over you
might have a bit of explaining to do.

Hi Fans,
Our local constables have started embracing photo radar with a passion.
I
don't want to start a thread on pros and cons - (I hate the damn things
since it takes the skill and fun out of avoiding tickets).  Our
defendant
govenor (who's begging for popularity now) has come out endorsing a
ballot
referendum to eliminate them.

 My question:  I have seen several cars with plastic covers on the
license
plates to presumably prevent them from  being readable from an angle by
the
radar camera.  some look like plain plastic but I'm not sure how well
this
would work and would prefer to get something designed (diffraction
grating?)
for this purpose.  I haven't seen them advertised so does anyone know of
a
place that sells specially designed covers for this purpose?

With the solution:
'85 944 Alpine white (for autocross)
'86 951 Alpine white (for track)
