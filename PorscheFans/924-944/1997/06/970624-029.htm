	Can't really comment too much on a turbo espceically without
	seeing it in person, but there might be a problem. Mine seems
	to do pretty well when cold but I never really push it hard
	until it gets warmed up. Hard to say if there's a problem here.

	Do you have clear fluid? Is there any grungy brown stuff in it?
	Have is it overflowed while you've been driving it? Do a leakdown
	and or compression test to confirm the head gasket theory.

	I think you're okay here. What you're describing seems to be
	fairly typical for most 944/951's. Some of us are experiencing
	real mystical cooling problems that may never get solved. The flow
	rate of your radiator can be checked by your mechanic without
	removing it from the car. Also, the condition of your water
	pump can be checked as well by monitoring the "weep hole" and
	wiggling the impellor shaftto see if there's any play. Both these
	are pretty easy. How many miles does it have on it (the water
	pump, I mean?)

	Hmm. Check your head gasket very carefully...

	When I experienced this problem, it was due to old, cracking
	ignition wires. You might check yours. Otherwise, it could
	be lots of things...

	Exactly, this is the wastegate opening. It's supposed to make
	that noise...so enjoy it :)

	Mail George Beuselinck at ecology@juno.com 
	George owns 944 Ecology, the place where 944's go to
	retire. He's got lots of these types of parts and he's
	wonderfully reasonable.

	I would say neglect, probably.

	Try George for these, too. Good luck...
