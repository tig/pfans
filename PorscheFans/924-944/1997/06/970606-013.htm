Gregor, 
In the interest of having more light while driving at night, one could upgrade
their headlights to Hellas with higher-than-stock (ie more than the sealed beam
55/60) H4 bulbs.  No need to go with more than 80/110 Watt bulbs, IMHO, as
anything more becomes a light-ray of death even when you carefully aim the
headlights (ie in cases you are going up a hill you still blind oncoming
traffic).  With the Hellas the lighting was plentiful and the pattern
excellent, the output of the foglights was not even noticeable after I switched
to the H4s.

On the other hand, I enjoyed your message greatly because being able to use the
fog lights w/o having the parking lights on is a great improvement!
