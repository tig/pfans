I'd say speeding qualifies as Porsche content...

For you open road speedsters this is a good speeding philosophy...

A few years ago, I was going to my then girlfriend's parents house for
Christmas. I live in Atlanta, they lived in Charlotte, and I left Atlanta
Christmas morning. Draw the connection?

Cops in South and North Carolina working Christmas? No way! Don't think I
wasn't just a little bit nervous about getting pulled, but 250 miles at
100-110mph! Oh the bliss! This was pre-Porsche, so I was on my BMW K75s
motorcycle, but oh how I love to recall that day... 100 was smack in the
lower powerband of 5th gear... too cool! 120mph on demand...

It started when I noticed old people going 80mph in their Crown Victoria's.
I was like, if the oldie von moldies are cruisin in ticket range, then
let's go!

I built a small caravan, including some Jap lux-o boats and a 5.0
Mustang... we were all happy campers... as I pulled off of I-85 to get onto
the Billy Graham Parkway (no lie!) everybody honked and waved! No middle
fingers, no reading the lips of people telling you stick it in an
impossible place...

another good time in general for everybody, is very early Sunday morning,
like 6:30am... the extra-DUI force is home and in bed, church looms for
many Cops, and traffic is light...

naturally, I don't really advocate open road speeding in general- you can
kill somebody else, for which words could not cope, and you're more likely
to hurt yourself should something go wrong... curbs, trees, telephone
poles, brick mailboxes, people pulling out to the left, are all very
different from gravel pits, run-offs,  and hay bale barricades as on
tracks...

but if you got to steal a moment, then you got to steal a moment...
