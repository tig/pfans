Hey dudes,

I probably should not do this, but I have a bunch of videos I am going to
copy into one nice tape.  These videos are from Japan and have the coolest
cars man has ever made.  I've been collecting these for a long time and
I want to put one really nice tape together with all the good stuff on it
(none of that drifting crap!).  Would anyone be interested in a copy?  I
do not want to make any money at ALL.  I also don't want to violate any
copyright rules, but it looks like these videos have no copyright and I
will be leaving all of the authors' names, etc. intact.  Also, I don't
think these videos are sold, just given free to magazine subscribers.

The cars include Skylines with 800hp.  Don't believe that number?  How
does 0-300km/h in 17 seconds sound?  I have seen it, it's wild looking
and sounds awesome.  Every video has a section on 0-300km/h as that is
the new standard by which all tuners are measured.  You see all the small
tuner shops out there running mid 20's, then the bigdogs come out, Greddy,
HKS, Blitz and now APEX.  It's a matter of saving face and HKS does not
dissapoint with the blistering 17 second run which I don't think anyone
is going to touch for a while.

They also have a lot of races such as when they pit a Carrera RS VS.
911 GT2 VS. 911TT VS. Ferrari F40 VS. Ferrari 328 VS Ferrari F355.
It's awesome to watch all of these cars drive down narrow twisty roads
full bore with traffic coming in oncoming.  They then drag race onto
a high speed oval and then they race against each other on a road track.

Have you ever seen a Ruf turbo blow the doors off a factory 911T to
the point where the factory turbo looks like a dot in the background?
Or how about seeing a Ruf Turbo pull up next to a Supra TT, all you see
from the wing cam is the 911 squat and the supra fall back and back 
and back.

If you have not seen the Vielside Supra run, you haven't seen what boost
is all about.  It's an all-or-nothing car, 20hp then 820hp.  The car
lights up its tires when boost hits in 4th gear!

Anyhow, let me know if there is any interest in these.  Once again, I
am not here to make a profit, just to distribute these videos as the
publisher of it intended.  There is tons of advertising on the videos
for the Japenese magazines from which they came so I feel their intent is
to have them watched and the advertisements seen.  I am just aiding that
cause.

I am only making this offer to the 944 list.  See, there are privaleges
to having your engine up front :)

Farzaan.
