Sometimes (quite often) when I start my 924, it makes a nasty grinding
noise, like when you hold the key in rightmost position after the engine has
fired up. I guess the starter doesn't pull back in time, or? The car has
been this way for at least a year (the PO mentioned this problem before I
bought it). I think it might have been this way for several years, because I
found a repair bill dated 1994 that mentioned the shop checking the starter.
The PO said he had it checked, and that the shop said something needed
lubricating, but I haven't done anything. My mechanic said it wasn't
anything to worry about, but I don't know about that.. Other than this
noise, the car starts fine. Any ideas?
