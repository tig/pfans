Mark,

I just had a warped rotor resurfaced and I apparently have enough metal
left to use it again. My rotors also have the lip on the edge, and it's not
burnished rust. The inside lip is less pronounced. Was using the stock S2
pads.

Anders, 

How important is it to make that slot in the Metal Masters? Does it drop
temperature significantly? Just put some new ones in.
