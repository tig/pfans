Well it finaly happened, everyone cautioned me about the timing belt on my
924 turbo but I fiqured that there was still time. I just bought my first
porsche and am hooked.
The car has been in my possesion for 32 Days and 1,100 miles and the
warranty is for
30 Days or 1,000 miles ( Damn Murphy and his Law ) so I am on my own on this
problem.
The car is a 1981 model and has 54,000 miles with what was once the original
timing belt. At least one or more valves have been bent and I will be
perfoming all needed repair. if anyone can give me some suggestions on
replacement parts availability and cost It would help me a great deal. Also
some pointers on the rebuild process, rest assured I will listen to anyones
advice and act quikly. No matter what, the few days that I was able to enjoy
this car will make the cost and effort of repairs not bad.

Porsche, Gotta love them ;)
