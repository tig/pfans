TO: Porsche Peers
FR: Rick (87 924S)

OK, just for the record, Dave Cooley up in Montana set me strait about
the maintenance rates that I was ranting and raving about.  I thought
$800 or so was a BFD for changing out the belts and water pump, but
apparently that what the job costs.  Guess that's a classic case of live
and learn.  In this case, mostly learn.  The other obvious lesson that I
gleened from this was that I'm just going to have to become a shade tree
mechanic as so many of you have become.  Either that or figure out how
to become independently wealthy.  Of course, if that was the case I
could probably swing a Boxter.  Just something to drive while my 924S
was in the shop.  Will be paying considerably closer attention to
everybody's technical conversations in the future and ask Santa for all
the necessary tools and a good set of jacks.  

Oh, by the way, has anybody joined the Porsche Club of America? 
Membership is $36.  Is it worthwhile to join or am I just getting a
nifty windshielf sticker out of the deal?  Thanks again, Porsche Plebe
