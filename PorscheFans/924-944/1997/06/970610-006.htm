  With new brake fluid coursing through the veins of my '86 944, I attended a 
Corvette sponsored Auto X on Sunday in Edinburgh, Ny. There was an assortment 
of ~35 vehicles: 3 Corvairs, 2 RX-7's, 2 Rabbits, a Jetta, several Cameros, 
many early and late 80's corvettes, 1 open frame buggy, 1 early 911, a 
Corrado, a Z24, some hot rod from the 50's, and me in my guards red '86 944. I 
did feel a bit out of place, and my wife thought we were all nuts. My friend 
was #2 with his street prepared Rabbit with Hoosiers, and I was #19. Not 
having the money to buy a helmet, my friend lent me his. We arrived around 
10:30am, unloaded all the stuff from the car, registered, signed the all 
inclusive waiver (they all laughed at me when I read it), went through tech 
inspection, attended the driver's meeting, and awaited our turns. The course 
started out with a loop around an oval next to the timing shack, with a sharp 
~290 Deg right turn into the course. This led up hill, into a sharp left hand 
turn onto a straight section where my speeds approached ~60MPH. Braking hard 
at the end of this straight, the course leads into a U bringing the car back 
through an S section, and around one final banked uphill turn before entering 
the loop by the timing shack, and then once more around the course. My friend 
ran times ~1:30:xx for the first two runs in his rabbit. My first run was 
1:38:xx, which included a two second penalty for knocking over a cone. My 
second two runs were ~1:34:60 and ~1:34:40. The best time was ~1:27:xx, with 
most around the 1:28:xx - 1:30:xx range. Several people were in the upper 
1:30's and low 1:40's. I had a great time driving the course. The oversteer 
definitely slowed me down, but made driving lots of fun. The event cost $10. 
My only regret is that I didn't wear more sunscreen, ouch!

 I plan to attend an Auto-X at the Fort Devens Air Force base in Ayers Mass on 
June 29th, but need to borrow a helmet. Anyone on this list going? Would you 
be willing to share your helmet? (My hair is clean). Also, I am looking for 
two used 215-50 15 D40M2 or other quality street rubber to place on the front 
rims. I would then move the D40M2 225-50 15's from the front to the rear rims 
replacing the M+S hard rubber that is there now. I am hoping this will make 
the vehicle more balanced, but don't have the money to buy new rubber.

Thanks!
       Ezra

Background Info on Vehicle:
 My wife and I purchased our 944 last fall. Since then I have rebuilt the ball 
joints(sent them to Dynamic Euro tech), tie rod ends, wheel bearings, engine 
seals, belts, rollers, front brake discs and pads, air filter, misc nuts and 
bolts, clutch master cylinder, etc.. The previous owner had installed 
225-50-15's on all four wheels. I replaced the front tires with 225-50 15 
D40M2's, leaving the 225-50 15 M+S tires from the previous owner on the rear 
(lots of oversteer).
