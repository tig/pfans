Hello,

I have an annoying transmission noise that I hope is the same as the
one Roger Moore fixed with Swepco.  I have a 1986 951 that is quiet when
cold, but is hellaciously loud after the transmission oil warms up.  At
idle, it's
a rattle coming from the rear of the transmission - can hear it best from
under the rear of the car.  The noise is really evident when
engaging/disengaging
the clutch in neutral at about 3000 rpm.  Can also hear it when letting off the
throttle in first or second gears at speeds of 20-25 mph - transmission sounds
much like a diesel engine under full power a few blocks away.  It hasn't
worsened
in the 12,000 miles since I bought the car (has 84k now), so I'm hoping that
this
is the 5th gear idler rattle mentioned in the 944 FAQ.

Where is a good place to purchase Swepco 201?
Is it OK to use with the limited slip transaxle (opt. code 220)?

Replacing the entire cam drive system is not too difficult - my local dealer
wanted $250 just to change belts. Considering that the belts are the cheapest
part of the whole system (about $40 for both), and the fact that both idlers
had loose, noisy bearings,  I bought the whole deal (cam and balance 
shaft belts and all idlers) for $130 from Vertex.  Before disassembling the old
system, I got a good "feel" for how tight the belts were so that I could get the
tension on the new ones close.  I then drove the car around for about 300 miles
(to get the belts through the initial "stretching" phase) and took it to the
dealer.
With belt cover off, I asked them to tension the belts.  At first they
wanted $125
(slimy) but they settled on $70, still a ripoff for 15 minutes' work.  Even
so, for
a total of $200 I have a properly-tensioned, broken-in new belt/roller system.

Starter was noisy, so I removed it and rebuilt it on the garage floor.  It
has a neat
inline planetary gearset in front of the motor.  Had to drill the screws out
that hold the 
solenoid to the housing (frozen), but that was the hardest part - all
bushings and
brushes were in great shape.  I greased everything, painted the body, and
reassembled - 
total cost $1.00 (for three stainless solenoid screws).  Engine has never
cranked faster
or quieter - starter whistles like a dentist's drill!

What is the normal boost (on dash gage) for a 1986 951?  Max. I get is 0.6 bar
(1.6 on gage). Since this is only about 8.7 psi, and the car is supposed (?)
to make
10.9 psi, I have been fiddling with it.  Have tried:
- Autothority stage 2 chips (1990 version) - Boost level went from 1.5 to
1.6 bar.  I did
  not put the restrictor in the wastegate signal line, but wouldn't the
separate KLR box 
  chip be able to increase boost by changing the wastegate solenoid pulsewidth?
- Removed intercooler and pressure checked - OK (cleaned it while it was out)
- Squeezed off hose leading to wastegate w/vise-grips and carefully tried a
full throttle
  run - boost went to 1.8 bar (11.6 psi) with wastegate locked closed!
- Removed wastegate to check for leakage - diaphragm OK, valve opens at
about 6 psi.
  Lapped the valve to assure no leakage.
- No exhaust or intake system leaks.
- No Motronic codes.
- Ignition system OK.
Am I chasing a nonexistent problem, or does 0.6 bar boost sound low?  Seems
like the turbo
should be capable of higher boost levels than this, particularly at high
engine RPM and load.

TIA, Eric
