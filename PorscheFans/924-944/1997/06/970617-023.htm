After being a " air-cooled " advocate for the last 30yrs, I decided it was time to 
look at the other Porsche models to drive as a more practicle daily driver while I 
continue rebuilding and restoring my old 911. The 951 guys always blow by me on the 
track, so I knew they were quick. Since I use the 911 on the track 6-7 times a year, 

I really needed something reliable that I didn't have to work with every weekend. 
After looking at at 928s and 944s for the last few months, I finally decided on a 
well maintained '89 944S2 ( thanks Paul Koslowsky !! ) Never having driven a 944 
before or having much knowledge of them, it was a mission of blind faith !!! Info 
from this list and from Paul and his mechanic ( my daughter saw and drove the car 
??? ) The only problem-- the car was in Phoenix and I'm in Indiana. I left all the 
details to my daughter (she runs a travel agency) and my wife and I flew out last 
week to pick it up.

This is one fantastic car !!! We put about 2500mi on it in 5days and had a GREAT 
time. If I had used the 911, we'd be beat to death. Phoenix, Sedona, Grand Canyon, 
Telleride, ect was a fantastic driving road to test the car, and it finished with 
flying colors.Passing and mountain climbing ability (even at 10,000ft) was 
impressive. The car was comfortable, quiet, and made for a very relaxed drive. I'm 
ready to do it again !! After not showing any interest in the "water-cooled" line, I 
must admit that I missed a significant, well engineered, practical, well handling 
Porsche model. As you can tell, I'm VERY impressed with this car. I still love my 
911, but this car is just what I need everyday....

The 911 list has helped me considerably in keeping my 911 running. Now I need info 
from this list. There are several things that need attention-- not major- and I'll 
need help with maintainance. I don't have shop manual for 944s ( I've got all 356 
and 911 factory manuals,ect- which DON'T much !!!) Right now I can see 3 problems 
that need attention.

1. the rear hatch won't open with the key. I can hear a "click", but it won't 
unlatch. It works from the button inside though.

2. The luggage cover won't retract. It has no spring tension. One of my sons pulled 
it out, and it will not go back onto the roller. I took it out of the car, and will 
get back to it when I have time..

3. The windshield wipers will not go to the stop position when turned off. I can get 
them parked be using the lever- but there must be a better way.  Also, the 
intermitten position does not work??

Also, the car doesn't catch on the first rev of the engine like my 911 does. It 
turns over 3-4 times before starting. No problem, but the 911 fires as soon as you 
hit the key!! I,m changing plugs this weekend, but is this a normal S2 procedure. It 
always starts and goes right to idle..

Better get going, time to get to the office. Thanks for any info from the list.. I'm 
sure I'll have more questions as I learn more about this GREAT car.
