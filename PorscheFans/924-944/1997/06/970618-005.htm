I had this happen to my 89 951 too. I left it a little longer than a
should have and returned one day to find no tip or pipe back too the
muffler. I had it fixed by a exhaust shop who welded a new section of
pipe on and replaced the tip. In regards to after market mufflers I
spoke with my mechanic at length on Friday. He said unless you are
flowing more exhaust gases , ie bigger turbo and/or stroker kit, dont
bother because the distance between the exhaust ports and the turbo cant
be reduced like say a 930 can. I personally would rather have a
stainless exhaust. It is expensive, but you never have to worry about
your exhaust again.......ever.

Hi all,

The O.E. tailpipe on my '86 951 is kind of cracking apart from the
tailpipe right where the oval part of the tailcone meets the pipe, right
before it goes into the muffler.  I've been kind of thinking about going
to an aftermarket muffler setup.  I've read on the list about different
setup's with "cat back" pipes and other setups that reduce backpressure
and improve performance.  However, I've also read where lower
backpressure can actually REDUCE performance.  I do not race my car
(well, on a track meant for racing, that is...)

Question.  The muffler seems OK.  Should I go with a new tailcone and
somehow weld it on, or a new O.E. muffler with tailpipe, or an
aftermarket part with the hopes of maybe a few more horsepower?  What is
the best setup?  I know how much new stainless exhaust systems are,
$800+.  Don't really want to afford that.  Any suggestions? THANKS

Bob K.
