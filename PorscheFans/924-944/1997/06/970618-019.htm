Once again, I beg the help of my PorscheFans friends....

    My motor stated making this strange noise a few days back. It's a
"winding" sound that seems to be coming from the top of the engine. Rev it,
and it changes pitch...but the same noise. 

    It is however, running like a bear. The belts are fine, timing belt and
tensioner, fairly new. Temp, normal.

     The best way I can describe the sound is that..did you ever drive like a
British car and hear that weird gear sound when in reverse? That's the sound.
Problem here is...the car does not need to be moving to make the sound, just
reving.

    It's going to the shop, hopefully this Friday, but I am curious. Any
ideas?

Many thanks!
