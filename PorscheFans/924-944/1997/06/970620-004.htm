Oh COME ON!  Arie can be a jerk sometimes, he was contesting
the win IN the winner's circle, and AJ understandably lost
him temper.  AJ has always had a temper, and he is definitely
one of THE greats.  Will anyone remember Arie in twenty years?

Too bad that a driver/owner of Foyt's skill and great historical
performance cannot keep his bloody hormones under control. Next time I
suppose he will come armed and just shoot the guy.....

I am sorry, but I get a bit disgusted at the antics of some of our
sporting heros, why they can't have a bit of decorum and graciousness
(applies to Lyuyendyk in spades as well) is totally beyond me....

Seems like another really good reason to not watch the IRL....
