Hi everyone,

I've got a question for those who know their way around (and behind) the
dash.  It seems I've burned out the bulb which illuminates my
temperature gauge; far left hand side of cluster.  I'm the ever-vigilant
sort so, at night, it really gets to me to be unable to easily read my
temp..  My mechanic advised me to pull the steering wheel, remove the
screws retaining the black plastic vent-grill/cluster surround, and tug
the surround completely out.  This is meant to give me access to the
area behind the cluster.  Everything was fine until I got to the tug
part.  Tug and tug did I; but, despite the fact that both left and right
extremes moved freely, the surround would not come out.  It seemed stuck
precisely *AT* the button for resetting the trip counter.  Fearful of
snapping this button's post off, I gave up and tried going behind the
dash from below.

>From below, I removed a bar-type electrical connector from the blue film
circuit board.  This allowed me to reach my thin little hands straight
up to four or five lamp holders (twist away type). Unfortunately, they
were all in fine shape.  I conclude that these must be the lamps for the
messages "Brake Pads" & "Parking Lights", etc..

Can anyone write me with the procedure I want for getting to the right
lamp?  Many many TIA.

Dave Cherry
