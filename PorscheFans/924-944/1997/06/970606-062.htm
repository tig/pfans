Steven,

I had an '86 951 for 7 years as my daily driver, sold it in '94, bought a
brand new '94 RX7. Just sold the RX7 and bought an '89 951.

I've owned about 3 dozen cars over the past 20 years from Fiats to
Ferraris, Lambo's to BMW's to 240Z's,  my favorite is the 951.

The RX7 has more low end torque than the 951, stiffer suspension, and has
really poor interior appointments (all plastic) but nicely laid out and
easy to use. Really poor gas mileage (~16mpg ave for 30k mi). The interior
room is nil. It's like getting into a glove. The first time my wife and I
went on a weekend trip in it, she put her stuff in the back, filled it up
and then looks up at me and says "Oh, where are you going to put your
stuff???" 
The brakes, handling, and acceleration on the RX7 are awesome but all the
engineering went into the chassis, engine & brakes, not the total package.

The 951 is smoother, probably a faster top speed, a much better ride, not a
rice burner, and much more elegant. I bought another one.

It's a matter of taste and what you're after.

my $.02.
