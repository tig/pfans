Thanks to all that responded; here are my findings:

A number of list members pointed out that there is no adjustment on the
steering. This is mostly true, as most 944:s have POWER steeering. 

For those with non-power steerings my explorative findings may be of
some interest: 
 
On non-power steerings (as all steerings are manual, I suppose :-) there
is a adjustment screw, that basically sets the play between the pinion
and the rack. This is done at the ZF factory, and should really not need
to be changed for many, many miles. However, as friction and wear takes
its toll, the play gets bigger, and a slight rattling on uneven grounds
may be heard. The adjustment screv is located on the opposite end to
where the pinion shaft enters the steering rack, and is the middle of
three 10 mm bolt heads protruding from a diamond shaped end plate.   

As my rack was (is) worn (a little) in the straight forward position
(many road miles), I tried out the adjustment facility. 

The adjustment bolt is very stiff (self locking) and a little adjustment
does a lot. It is therefore imperative not to make the adjustment on the
less worn part of the rack, together with the less worn part of the
pinion. If an old rack is adjusted for minimum (no) play in the center
position, binding WILL occur as soon as the steering is shifted as
little as 1/8 of a wheel revolution, so shift the steering wheel 1/4 of
a revolution before finetuning the adjustment. Adjust it until it will
bind, and then back off until the steering goes easily again. Test drive
and readjust if neccessary. 

To extend lifelength (similar to CV joints), the pinion should ideally
be taken out, turned 1/2 revolution and reinserted, now mating fresh
gear edges to the worn center of the rack, before a new base adjustment
is established.          

It was a significantly better feel (less rattle) just by adjusting it a
little, tho'. But make it too tight, and the steering will be 'stiff' -
most unpleaseant and possibly even dangerous in a thight spot (the
steering may not return to 'straight-ahead' without manual intervention.
