Steven,

In a message dated 97-06-04 22:23:15 EDT, you write:

< There has been lots of talk recently about highway police.
.... etc ...
<  Maybe salary is one of them. Here, RCMP mounties
< who patrol all provinces' highways but Ontario and Quebec now must be
<university graduates and they are paid as such. 

Well just last night on the Late Show with Jay Leno (I think it was either
that show or the one after it on NBC)   They had a person come in whose name
was Robert Jordan who was not accpeted into a Police dept due to the fact
that he was "too" intelligent - based on some new testing process they have
introduced.  Unfortunately my memory doesn't serve well enough to recall
where he was - It was somewhere out East like Connecticut???

So I guess that says it all huh?  Just my $.02
