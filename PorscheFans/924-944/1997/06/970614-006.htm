Ugh, it's been a very bad week.

My pristine, low-mileage '89 951S was involved in an accident this week,
and I'm afraid it's going to be a total loss. I don't think there's any
structural damage (front-right suspension is slightly bent), but there's
quite a bit of body work to do and parts for these cars are very expensive;
the initial estimate from the body shop exceeds the Blue Book value of the
car.

I never realized how much I loved this car until this happened and I'm
faced with the difficult reality of replacing it.

My insurance company hasn't yet stated whether or not they want to total
the car, but I'm preparing for the worst. A couple of questions I'm hoping
fellow listmembers can help me with.

1. Can anyone recommend a good Porsche-experienced body shop in the San
Francisco Bay Area (preferably Peninsula or north; I live in Marin county)?
If the car is repairable I want to make sure the work is done absolutely
right.

2. Who can help appraise the car? Blue Book is around $15.5k, but given the
relative rarity of this model and its excellent condition, I feel the car
is worth more. Ads in Pano and Excellence seem to support my position, but
I'd like to find a local Porsche specialist who can fairly appraise it in
light of these facts.

3. I may need to find another car, preferably in the Western US. My car is
street-driven only (no track cars please) and should be in excellent
condition both mechanically and appearance-wise. I really want another
951S, but I need a replacement soon so I'll also consider 968s, especially
those with the M030 package. If you know of such a car please let me know
-- direct e-mail works best.

Thanks in advance,

-Jeff
