<< <<Just wondering if anyone might be able to give me their opinion of what
 this relay clicking might be.  Under normal driving conditions with
 everything turned off (Lights,Heater, A/C, Etc) I can hear what appears to
 be a relay clicking on and off as I'm driving.  It seems to occur more when
 I changing RPM or sometimes accelerating from a low RPM.  In fact sometimes
 I can hear it switch about 10 times very rapidly while accelerating from a
 stop.  Anyway I was just curious if anyone has experienced a related
 problem or might be able to throw some advice my way.  Thanks for all the
 help.>>
 
 I have exactly the same thing on my '87. I posted the same concerns as you,
 but from what I could gather from the group (i.e. no response), it's can't
 be too much of a problem, if one at all.
 
 Good luck,

Hey guys,

Just for grins, check your cruise control actuator (passenger side ahead of
the battery . . . . there is a throttle-type cable going to it).  Mine
started clicking and it nearly drove me crazy until I found out what it was.
 It only clicked sometimes, at very low speeds during acceleration (ie. 5-8
mph), and only when I was going forward.  Finally, I found that it would also
click while in neutral with the clutch out and slightly elevated engine
speed.  I was able to observe the actuator with the hood open (while sitting
in the driver's seat) by looking under the trailing edge of the hood . . . .
.. that little actuator was clicking like crazy!  Since I rarely use my cruise
control (it's not too reliable as others have testified to) it doesn't bother
me.  Whenever it starts clicking I can make it stop immediately by either
switching the cruise control to "cancel" or "off" positions . . . . . it
stops every time.  I know this isn't the desired "fix" to the problem . . . .
.. I'd like to have someone answer that question.
