	Do not install an american engine in this car. In fact, I advise
	not install the 968 engine in it, either. Porsches, much more so
	than "regular" cars, come as an integrated unit. Each part
	designed to work specifically with a particlar mate and the
	whole designed to work together as a unit. This is all 
	engineered in the design room and at the factory. This has become
	espcially true of the newer cars because of increased technology
	as the years have gone by. Replacing your 944S engine with an
	american car will throw the entire vehicle out of balance. The
	968 engine won't be as bad but it still won't work properly.
	My advice is this; you want 250-300 hp and you've already
	said you got 10 grand to spend. Sell your old 87 S for scrap
	and put that money with your 10K and buy yourself a 951. That
	makes much more sense than your ideas. Good luck!
