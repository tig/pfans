When we were building up the Talon and reading all the R&D that David
Buschur (now at 11.066 @ 128mph in the 1/4 on engine alone) did with the
ignition wires, it was determined that the Nology wires were a big waste of
money.  At first, you will notice a gain, but it will quickly diminish.
The gain at first is usually from putting in new spark plugs when you change
wires.  David B. essentially brought up one major point, if you have to use
these wires to get a better spark, there's something wrong with your ignition
and this is just a band-aid solution to it.  A set of wires that worked 
excellent on the Talon were Magnecores.  They had a tight fit, were extremely
flexible and when I accidentaly ripped one, Magnecore sent a WHOLE new set
for free even though I broke it due to my stupidity!
