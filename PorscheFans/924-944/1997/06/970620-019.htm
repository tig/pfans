Howdy,

That was a great post Nick!  I got a few emails from the people that I really
wanted to hear from yesterday and they gave some pointers and some encouragement.
So, I've still got the test drive planned for Monday of the RS America (there
are no C2's for sale around town right now to drive so the RS America is the
closest I can come to a C2), but I got a chance to sit in a C2 Tip that's for sale.
Hmmm... how to say it nicely... they charged $100,000 for that interior when it
was new?  Did you guys know the rear window defogger button is like a cigar
lighter plug?  But, I still didn't mind that (thoughts that go through your
head are: "well, the driving experience must make up for all of this".  What
I did mind was cheezy materials used on the roof panel and the door panels,
and even the center console (maybe it's only for the Tip models that have this
elephant-hyde-look plastic).  But, I am not putting down the C2, I like all
Porsches, but the interior really is a step backwards from the 951.

I also decided to take the 951 for a HARD boot and try out different chips
again to see the differences.  I still like the smoothness of my chips, but
Paul's APE's have more low end (always tradeoffs!).  What I did find was that
this car has A LOT of personality at WOT, it's just too bad you drive too
fast at WOT everywhere :)  I actually took a corner down a back road that
stunned me a bit.  I went into this corner really hard and floored it through
the corner, the tail stepped out, so I eased the throttle back and it started
to understeer, stand on it again and oversteer, then ease off just a touch
and a 4-wheel drift.  Hmmmm... that sure did feel good.  Now, if only I
could do that on the track!

I think all that my car needs is a bit of uniquness, maybe just an exhaust or
cat-con bypass or a lip spoiler or maybe a 968 Turbo S wing with front winglets,
something to set it apart from all the others at the events.

My compressor bypass valve should be coming soon, that will give it some
personality for sure.

Farzaan.
