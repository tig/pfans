Hey, let's not forget that other lucky survivor: the Honda/Acura NSX.  It's
got to be on it's ninth life by now since it costs $90,000 and only pushes
290 horses (was only like 250 a year ago, but quadruple-bypass surgery has
given the NSX a few more months to live).  Not to mention that it has less
torque than my little brother's bicycle.
