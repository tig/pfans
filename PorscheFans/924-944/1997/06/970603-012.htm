Greetings all,
	I just subscribed to this list, so I'm a newbie here, so bare with
me :)  I recently bought my first porsche, and decided I liked the 944.
I bought a 944, 1987 model... black outside, black leather inside, that
came with all the avaliable options (power sr, win, locks, etc).

A good condition car, I paid $7,950 for it.  Cut a deal with the owner,
that i'd have it checked out at a mechanic and whatever costs to repair
any problems, come out of the initial cost of the car.  Anyone comment
if they think I paid too much?

The car drives great, i love it... very nice looking car.. it purrs
once I hit 80mph and above.  I have noticed a few abnormal things,
and i'll list them, maybe someone can help me out with them:

	1) The car drives terrible on water, maybe it needs new tires,
	but the tires still have good amount of tread on them.  When i
	hit a puddle of water on the highway, the car wheel will turn 
	towards the water (pull towards it), and the car feels like its
	being pushed the oppisite direction.

	2) The car, when i start it up, makes this squeeking noise, it
	goes away after i shift it into geer and start moving.  I don't
	know if I should worry or leave it.

	3) The breaks when I push down on them, will make my steering
	wheel start to pull to either the left or right side (random it
	seems), but makes it dificult to slow down when the car is
	trying to pull you towards one of the ajecent cars.

Thats about it for the problems I have with the car... btw, the repairs
I had done, were a new rack and pinion (the car was making a lot of noise
when I was turning the wheels to either side), and a fix for the
electrical short the car had (it was sitting in a garage for 2 years).
I also had the mechanic here do the full tuneup, as the car has 63,000
miles on it.


thanks in advance for any help given,

--jason
