Hi, P-Fans,

I'm getting ready to work on my brakes next weekend, and I'm having a hard
time selecting the proper brake pads.  For the next year or so I plan to
use the car as a daily driver as well as on the track an average of once a
month.  If I get really hooked on track driving, (okay, hooked more) I'll
get a different car for daily use and get a turbo 944 for the track and
deck it all out, but for the next year or so, or until I come into major
money, hee hee,  I'm going to be learning on this car.

So my choices are OEM/equivalent brake pads, PBR Metal Master brake pads,
or Carbon Kevlars.  I'm not happy with the ordinary pads as I have
experienced moderate brake fade on the track as they get hot.  The PBR's
are semi-metallics, which reputedly wear out like butter but are marketed
for autocross use.  My racing instructor buddy recommends the CK's but they
are three times the cost of the other two pads.  

Recommendations, opinions, advice?  Thanks, o wise ones.
