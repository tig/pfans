You are correct (I think) about the tool as you described.  EuroSpeed has
attempted to provide a conversion chart for the Porsche Scale to that of
the Snap-On tool.

There are two things to consider about the Snap-On tool and any other tool.

1) Is the instrument accurate and precise.  (Accuracy is the ability to
measure an attributes characteristics, or dimensions to some standard and
agree.  Precision is the ability to carry that accuracy over the full range
of the measured scale desired).

2) Repeatability.  Can this measurement be repeated with the same results
time after time.

The first point really says that the instrument must be of suitable quality
and be applicable for the task at hand (range of measurement).

The second point mandates that it be consistent over time.

As a third point, we need to be able to use this instrument in the
environment we have, and does it mechanically fit where we have to measure
without compromising points one and two.

I for one am becoming more interested in perusing John Prunty's post on
6-22-97 where he said "I was talking to Jerry @ Motormeister in Downey,CA.
He mentioned that Gates ( the fan belt and timing belt people) sell an
identical tensioning tool, for much less $$ but w/english [sic] units".

Anyone know where to get one of these tools?  Who do we call?
