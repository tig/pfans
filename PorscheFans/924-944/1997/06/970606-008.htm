Hi All,

Ok, I get back to work from lunch, pull the inside door handle to get out
and something pops and the door won't open.  Now it seems nothing is
attached to handle.  Pull it out and it just stays out.  I'm hoping nothing
broke and something just popped off.  It would also be nice if I didn't
have to pull the door panel too but that seems unlikely.

BRAKES - they work great, have tons of meat left on them, but the squeal
like hell under 20 mph (sorry don't know how fast that is in kph).  Any
other car I've had the only thing to stop that noise was new pads.  But I'm
not sure if the shop that did the last brake job (the PO had that done),
used any disc quiet.  I have a can of the stuff and the pads seem pretty
easy to remove so I was wondering if anyone thought it might help to pull
them out and spray some on the back plates.

TIA

Michael Belfoure
