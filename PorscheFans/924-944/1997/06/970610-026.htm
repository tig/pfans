David,
      I am not certain that the speedometer can be re-calibrated. However, 
since you are running stock tires, and your speedometer reads fast, some 
calibration must be possible. The system is electronic. For '85.5 and up, 
there is a Hall effect transducer (senses magnetic fields) mounted on the top 
of the transaxle. It sends an electrical pulse for every revolution of one of 
the shafts which is directly connected to the wheels. This signal is fed to 
the electronic speedometer/odometer, and is also used by the cruise control 
unit. The odometer is nothing more than a pulse counter, but with a pre-scale. 
The speedometer measures the frequency of the signal, so it must contain a 
Frequency to voltage converter (it is also possible that it measures pulse 
width, but this would not be as accurate) which drives the display you see 
(very similar to most electronic RPM gauges). Since this is most likely an 
analog ckt, it is possible it has drifted over time, causing the erroneous 
readout you see. I highly doubt your odometer is reading incorrectly. Both are 
easily checked by using roadside distance markers. I will look at my factory 
workshop manuals to see if it has any info on speedo re-calibration. Others 
have posted instructions on how to remove the speedo.
  At some point, I will build a microprocessor ckt. to allow for correction of 
speed when using non-stock tires. The ckt would accept the hall sensor signal 
as an input, raise or lower the frequency depending on tire size (maintaining 
the correct duty cycle), and send this new signal to the 
Speedometer/odometer/cruise... How much interest is out there for such a 
product? I would put more of a priority on it if people were interested in 
buying it from me.

Let me know what you determine with regards to your problem.

Good Luck,
          Ezra
