The IRL????!?!?!?  What, a two year history, amateur hour league is now
being
compared, indirectly, with F1?  I think you are missing the difference
in 
technology between NASCAR and Formula One.  It's not even close.  As for
cojones--how about driving a CART open wheel racer with 900 turbocharged
horses at average speeds of almost 230mph on a superspeedway?
