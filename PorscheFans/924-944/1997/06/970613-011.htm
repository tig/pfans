This is my first message (or reply) that I have sent... hope all goes
well. I 
know a shop in San Jose (Campbell) who does great work. It's called CT
Automotive 
and the owner is Don Wise..Great Man. Number is 408.377.3885. This shop
was
recommended to me by many places including David at Powerhaus!!
 
My father recently past away andleft me his 1989 944 Turbo S. I needed
to find a 
shop in my area (SJ) thatI felt comfortable with.. CT Automotive.This
car was 
everything to my father. Guards red, black leather interior, all the
options, oil 
changed every 3K miles and only has 42K on the odometer (one of the best
keep 
Porsche's I have seen... but I know there are a lot of them out there
and CHEERS to all). 
My father let me drive it ONCE..Now that I have the time to enjoy it I
now understand the 
Porsche legend. This car has the ability to bring out a side of me I
have never seen... 
and I love it!! If anybody is in my area and would like to talk
"Porsche", please drop me 
a message at dtully@slip.net. By the way, this list, and the archives,
is the greatest 
thing since slice bread.

>Recently, I discovered an oil leak on my '84 944 that I have traced to
>the frontmost outside corner of the cam housing, right behind the
>distributor. A new cam housing gasket was installed 14 months ago after
>a timing belt broke under the PO, resulting in a total top-end rebuild,
>which I had done at local shop. I can see fresh oil coming out at that
>point, and am certain it is not coming from the oil cooler (which was
>rebuilt 3 years ago under same PO, according to maintenance records).
>Checked the cam housing bolts, and they are tight (at least the lower
>ones, which are out in the open).

>I am wondering: how involved is the gasket replacement to the
>mechanically inclined, non-mechanic owner (me). Checked a few shops in
>the SF Bay area; one said he uses some special "cam holding" tools,
>another said he's gotten by without such. Another said maybe the head is
>warped, and the head gasket might need replacement, too...hmm. All say
>the job is about 4-5 hours and the gaskets about $40. Is this correct?
>
>The motor seems that it runs a bit hot to me compared to my old 85.5 944
>(upon opening the hood) but maybe that's my impression of the heat
>coming off the Bursch headers. Temp gauge climbs into the high zone with
>engine running (but no warning exclamation light), and immediately goes
>to normal (low-middle range) with key ON and motor OFF when I park it. I
>have attributed this to gauge/sensor old age (maybe I am wrong here?) as
>the lamps on the temp gauge and clock both quit a few months ago, and I
>have not had a chance to trace it to a fuse or bad ground yet.
>
>My old shop has moved away from street cars to concentrate on their race
>projects, so a recommendation of a reliable shop between San Francisco
>and San Jose would be gratefully appreciated...and thanks for any advice
>from the list!
>
>I'm adding oil to replace the loss, oil pressure is good, motor getting
>dirty..argggg.
