You're about 5 months too late on the 930 brakes.

930 brakes are the same SIZE as 944turbo

I upgraded to 928GTS (actually 993 twinn turbo) braking on my 911
hence the sale. Pics can be seen at my home page.  I ended up using
Racer's Group rotors on the front and 993tt on th rear.

Brake capacity is roughly equivalent to pad area...very roughly...

The 930 package will yeild approximately 2X the pad area of your carrera setup.

The 993 twinn turbo setup has 95%/58% larger pad area (than the 930) setup.

Essentailly 5 caliper/pad sizes are available, percentages approximate based on 930 as 100%

1,2) Carrera (CF, CR) two-pot	(50%/40%)
3) 930 (F&R), 944turbo (F&R), 928 (R) C2 (F), 993(R), C2 (late R) (100%)
4) 928S4 (F), 944tS (F) C2(Late F), 993 (F) 993tt (R), C2t (92-93F)(158%)
5) 928GTS(F) C2t 3.6 (F) 993tt/C4S(F) C2RSR (F) (195%)

As for the rotors:

911 carrera:	12"x28mm	12"x19mm

930		12"x32mm	12"x28mm (all cross drilled)

928S4		12"x32mm	12"x28mm (Solid rotors)

928GTS		12.88"x32mm	12"x28mm (drilled?)

993tt		12.88x32mm	12.88x28mm (all drilled)

Be careful when selecting calipers.  Calipers may have different
piston sizes and mounting configurations depending on origial use.

For example, at a quick glance the 928S4(F) caliper may seem
to be the same as the 993tt(R) caliper.  This is wrong on three counts:

	a) The 928S4 caliper has a flat mounting surface, 993ttR has ears

	b) 928S4 caliper is set up for mounting behind the rotor, not in front
		(this is hard to change)
	c) 928S4 caliper is for 232mm rotor, 993tt(R) is for 28mm

Not to mention that one is black and the other red...also not easily changed 
if you want iot to say "PORSCHE"

Be careful to know what you are getting.  I bought 993tt rear calipers
to adapt to my 911 RSR 3.8, only to find that I had to machine off the ears,
drill and tap, and then get caliper adapters, whcih was a $500 adventure.  Had
i purchaced the 928S4 calipers and used them on the rear, however, piston sizes would have 
been poorly matched and I would have had to reverse caliper direction, whiic is NOT the same as swapping sides brcause bleeder and cross over pipe holes are different sizes oter then the thread.

More than you wanted to know!
