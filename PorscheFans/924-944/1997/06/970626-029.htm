But if the basic 944 is already a great handling car, is the slightly
better handling in the 968 significant?

I haven't driven a 968, but I'm sure it's a fantastic car.  The only bad
rap against it that I've heard or read comes from the 924/944/968/928 book
by Vivian.  He said that compared w/ the 3rd gen RX-7, the 968 was
relatively clumsy and almost scary in the corners.  The one RX-7 I've
driven convinced me it is one of the few cars in the same price range that
is comparable or better than the 944 line in handling, and the acceleration
is amazing. But Vivian's criticism seems a bit overstated.
