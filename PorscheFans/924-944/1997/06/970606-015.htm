Two weeks ago (5/22/97) I called EuroSpeed because they advertised same
day shipping and to match anyone's price.

I emphasised that the parts needed to ship immediately as I was
awaiting the valves/gasket kit for the machine shop.

I called tuesday (5/27) to make sure the parts had shipped.  As usual,
Ron was not available, so I left yet another message.  He called back
about 2pm to dsay all the parts were boxed, and ready to go, and that
they would ship that day for sure.  Hae offered to ship them overnight,
but I opted againt that as the shipping would be onerous.  Besides,
they were supposed to ship the week previous ("Friday for sure") so I
saw no reason for my spending the additional shipping $.  I needed
them by that friday (5/30)

I called twice wednesday, to make sure the stuff had shipped ($800 + of
misc 911/944 parts).  No ron.  I left messages both times.  I then
called several times thursday to check status.  No Ron (surprise).  I
then called and had the parts I needed overnighted from EAP, and called
back EuroSpeed to cancel the order.  Since ron was not available I left
the message.

I got a call friday (5/30) from Ron wondering why I needed to cancel the
order.  I reiterated that I needed the parts by that day (friday).  He
said they'd shipped Wednesday and I should have them "any minute".  I
told him too bad, because I was now had the parts in hand and no longer
needed the parts from him.

The parts from him arrived wednesday of this week.  The Secratary
signed for them by mistake. They were shipped 3-day, which meant they
didn't go out until after I canceled the order.

In addition to shipping a week after promised, he charged me $30
shipping for a 20lb max box, because he had (a) shipped it three day
select and (b) packed it in such a way as to go OVERSIZE.

In addition, I noticed he was kind enough to raise all the proces by
adding $.99 to each proce he quoted, for a total for $14 in excess
charges.  Add to that $16 in excess shipping charges and I would get nailed 
for $30 more than expected.

UPS is returning the package as we speak. I also contacted Discover card
to inform them of the situation.

FYI,
	Steve
