There is a slot for the wear indicator, but there is a much more
important slot missing. Farzaan pointed out that Metal masters lack the
vent channel usually found on brake pads. It is the narrow slot that is
cut in the middle of the pad. It is, however, easy to correct. Two hack
saw blades mounted in paralell will make a nice vent channel, as will a
few minutes with the edge of a thin flat file. 

As for discs, opinions vary. I have had good results with turning,
others have not. 

One theory is that used and turned discs may be 'more' resistent to
warping than new ones, as possible stress has been relieved by using
them. 

Are you sure that the lip is for real and not just burnished rust. If
its rust, it can (must) be peened away. There may also be a 'lip' in the
center of the disc, check that too. 

If it really is a protruding lip, the disc is probably worn very close
to limits anyway and turning may be impossible even if it is serviceable
(just). If you choose to use it, just chamfer the edges of the pad, so
it will wear in to the lip easily.   

New pads on old discs need somewhat longer break in than on new discs.
