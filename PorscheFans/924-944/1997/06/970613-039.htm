Greetings to all.
I just crossed over 142,000 miles on my 85.5 944. It got me wondering
how many high mileage 944s there are out there. If you have a high
mileage car please reply. I remember crossing over 100,000 while doing
100 mph. I wish I had a camera mounted for that shot...



My '83 944 has done 135,000 Miles and is still going strong. A recent
computer engine test at the Porsche garage showed that the engine is still
going strong.
Believe it or not but I drive my car as an everyday car in the United Arab
Emirates where the outside temperature reaches 45 Celsius at this time of
the year. No Problem !!!

While I am writing to you guys maybe someone can shed some light on the
following myth going around here :
apparently in 1983 Porsche built a 944 they called Lux. According to what I
heard they only made 500 Nos. and all of them were gold from the outside,
brown stripe fabric interior and yellow dials.
Now, is that true ???? If yes, what else is different in this 944 compared
to others of a similar age ?
I would really like to get to the bottom of this and appreciate any input.

Thanks

Joern
