Lee,

I have often wondered whether or not this puts unneccessary pressure or stress
on the 2 wheels that are on the ground because the car is being lifted in an
unnatural way - as opposed to lifting the car with both front wheels off the
ground or both rear wheels off the ground.

Also, how would you put the car on 4 jack stands?  Once you have one side on
stands, to the jack the other side up would be very risky, right, because the
stands could fall, not to mention the frame could be twisting?

I noticed that part of the frame runs underneath the engine.  Is it Ok to use
that point to raise the front end of the car before placing on stands?  How
about using the transaxle housing (if that's the part I'm thinking about) to
raise the rear?

TIA
