It has been a lot of Police Bashing the last week. 

It makes me feel real bad to hear about this. 

I may have a much better impression of the police than most of you, and
that is not only because I live in Sweden, where I suspect the police
are pretty decent. 

For a number of years I worked (as a computer consultant, not a cop!)
for the Swedish police - but still, I think I know something how
policemen may work and think.

First I would like to point out that Sweden have 'softer' criminals than
most other countries, and certainly the US. I have yet to see a Swedish
'highway patrolman' (traffic police) even hint at the fact that he is
armed when asking drivers for their drivers licence - maybe that would
be different the day someone brought out a gun insted of a wallet.

Be that as it may, policemen are trained in the same skills and in the
same way all over the western world. They usually do the same kind of
work, and, mind you all, that kind of work is something that most of us
can't be paid high enough to want to do.   

Policemen do get formatted by the work they do. Usually their social
life is dominated by other policemen and their families - mostly because
of working hours, and the impossibility to talk shop with 'civilians'.

This means that they may alienate with the people they are to 'serve and
protect'. So, maybe it is a good idea to invite a police officer for
dinner, someday, sometime... 

Second, they usually see only the bad stuff, they meet and work with all
the bad people and they seldom see a truly positive end to any their
work - even when it is 'successful'. 

My impression is that 'real' cops do not especially like traffic duty,
its a waste of their time. They prefer chasing 'real' criminals. Some
individuals are just not fit to talk with ordinary people even if they
are effective policemen and that may be a assignment problem. Traffic
cops, OTOH are very interested in road safety, and to them speeding is
no small offence and ticket writing is just a tool of the trade. Speed
kills, at least statistically, and the law is blind to the fact that we
all Porsche friends are very good drivers that never are into accidents.
Are we not, BTW - looking at insurance costs ?    

We all have seen 'Dirty Harry Callahan', the Clint Eastwood cult police
inspector. We certainly do not want to have him check out our drivers
licenses, but may secretly joy ourselves of his swift ways and handiness
with hardware when he is giving the bad un's hell... 

I wonder if the American myth complex may have something to do with it,
(the unordely cowboys riding their 'horsches' and the law enforcer
keeping order and justice on behalf of the Ford owners - and to hell
with anyone opening their mouth) or if it is only a the sad story of
underpayed state or county employee taking a petty revenge on the 'upper
class' in their expensive cars...  

Remember too the wise words of another list member: Not even the US is
classless. Usually, policemen are also triggered by the usual human
reaction buttons, and they can be expected to act harshly on a speeding
brat in a too expensive car, especially if that brat is ever so slightly
hinting about 'nazi stormtroopers' or something similar.

For those requiring 'people skill' out of policemen, have in mind that
'people skill' goes both ways.
