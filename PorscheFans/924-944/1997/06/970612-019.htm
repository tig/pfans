Hi Dan,

Thanks for responding!

Your Welcome

I agree, Paul is very professional and knows what he's talking about.
 I have purchased these pads from him but have yet to install them.

I was just trying to get opinions from others who have already used
these pads.  I plan on using them on the street, as well as autocross
and drivers ed.  Have you experienced alot of noise/squeal and do they
produce alot of dust?

I have used the Orange and Blue pads, the 1st set of orange I got did creak 
and squeal on the street. Then I started using steel wool on the pins every 
time I swapped pads, and the noise went away. I have used them for auto-X , 
DE, and Race, and they are better when they are warm. They last until they 
don't (what I mean is when you push them to the last 1/8 inch they go 
abruptly. When you get to the ceramic it goes in a lap.

Best of luck.
Dan
