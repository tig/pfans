	These cars are all as similar as they are dissimilar. By that,
	I mean they are from the same basic design yet each one is
	it's own evolution. We all know that when a Porsche model
	evolves, great changes are made in the car as opposed to GM
	where "evolution means changing the shape of the tail lights.

	You can't go wrong at all with any of these cars. The 968 will
	be most expensive, followed by the Turbo and the S2. Depending
	on the specific car, the second most expensive could be either
	the Turbo or the S2. As far as rarity, these are Porsches; they're
	all rare. If you mean rarity where it concerns desirability, I
	guess I'd go with the Turbo. Lots of people seem to want those.
	They all share the same history (I assume you mean racing
	history) since they all come from one platform orginally. The
	924GTR and 944GTR were awesome racing machines as were the
	Cup cars. About performance; that's a very subjective subject.
	I can tell you the Turbo is fastest, the S2 has a friendly
	driveability, and the 968 is more like the S2 only faster
	and better. The 968 is the best handler of the group. But this
	really doesn't tell you anything. You need to find three of these
	models and try them out yourself. You didn't say so I'm not
	sure you asked yourself but, "What do you want your car to do?"
	Go fast? Or take corners at 100? Or have a strong throttle
	response? Broad power band or narrow power band? These are things
	to consider. You left out one thing; maintenance. The Turbo will
	be most expensive followed by the S2 then the 968. If you're
	lucky, you might even be able to find a 968 under warranty
	still. Good luck.
