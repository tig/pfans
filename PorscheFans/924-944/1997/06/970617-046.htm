Hi Gang,

Over the last few weeks I have followed with interest the threads
relating to ball joint replacement options. I would very much
like to replace the joints on my '86 944 over the summer but have not
seen the final conclusion as to what options are available to me.
What I would really like to try is replacement of my joints myself
w/o replacing the control arms. I have access to a wide variety of 
shop equipment ovens, presses, mills, lathes and grinders. I greatly
enjoy doing difficult projects myself if at all possible especially 
since I can afford my time easier than my cash. (Yes I'm cheap)(well
maybe frugal, no.. all right cheap) I really prefer to save for things
that I can't fix.

So the questions are: 
Where can I get just the joints?
How much are they?
Can they be replaced w/o some magic machine?
If not, will rabbit control arms really work at least until I can afford
to have mine fixed?

Sorry about the excessive bandwidth.
