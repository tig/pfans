Hi Mohit was there any replies to your post you can share? I thought you
use the Perfect-It G first then Imp. HG after to remove any traces of
Perfect-It and for the finer abrasive effect?

Is the Perfect-It Glaze the same stuff as the Perfect-It Swirl Mark
Remover in a larger size?

The 3M web page lists the ingredients in each product, Imp. HG lists
Aluminum Silicate as part of its makeup, this is a finer abrasive than
Aluminum Oxide?

My Perfect-It bottle says to rub until dry, no mention of letting it sit
before buffing.

Can the streaking be removed by using something like Perfect-It Gloss
Enhancer/ Meguiars #34 Final Inspection? Interestingly the ingredients
listed for the gloss enhancer is just water and isopropyl alcohol. I =
would
think this would tend to remove any wax. Maybe it just softens it and
makes the wax level?

Which 3M product would I use that is one step more agressive than the
Perfect-It glaze, "Finesse-It" or "Fine-Cut Rubbing Compound paste? or
liquid?" ? TIA

Subject: Head Gasket replacement and more pain

Hi all,

Just thought I'd write everyone a note to let them know how much fun it
is to accomplish a head gasket replacement on a 944 turbo.  To be
perfectly frank, it blows.

Some of my observations:

1.  Murphy's laws do apply.

2.  Replace parts even if you think they seem fine.

	- studs stretch...  mine elongated the threads.  This caused the head
gasket replacement in the first place.  It allowed the number four
cylinder to overpressurize the cooling system.

	-  My water pump went out when I restarted my car after redoing the
whole head gasket thing the second time.  So I had to remove the whole
front assembly again.  In short, replace the damn thing.

3.  Do get Raceware studs.  Their technical support is very good.=20
However, do not bother getting their extractor/installer tool for
extracting the studs.  It's useless for this purpose.  It would be very
good for installing the new studs.  The Porsche studs and the Raceware
studs have different threads, so make sure you get the one you need.  I
have the Porsche version if anyone wants it...

4.  Helicoils do work.  I had to fix a few stripped threads from Bozo
the mechanic who had my head off last time.

5.  Have your head rebuilt while its off.  Again make sure all the parts
are reinstalled... Right, Steve.

6.  Many people have said the studs are not much fun to remove.  They
aren't, but it is a lot easier with heat.  I used a heat gun I have from
building model airplanes...  Don't laugh it worked.  A pipe wrench also
made a good persuader.  Double nutting also worked.

7.  If you spill copious amounts of oil your car will smoke from many
strange places...

If any one has any questions on this job, feel free to contact me.

	Hi!
I do not know what is 944 S2 turbo, but if it is anything like US. 951,=20
there a few test for you to try if you are suspecting boost controlling
circuit (cycling valve, wastegate, etc...).
	Get a good manometer to be able to get accurate boost pressure
	readings.

	Check Compressor Bypass Valve (CBV). It is a little black can with
	three connections (two larger, and one smaller). It sits on top
	of a Rubber Sleeve(RS) that goes from air flow meter to the turbo=20
	fresh air intake. The other larger fitting of CBV connects=20

I would like to get some opinions about which 4 cyclinder Porsche is
better to own.  The candidates are:

1989 Porsche 944 Turbo S : because it is the fastest 4 cylinder Porsche
to date and it's the last year of the 944 Turbo.

1991 Porsche 944 S2 : because it is the last year of the 944.

1995 Porsche 968 : because it's the last year of the 4-cylinder Porsche.

Which of these would be the best one to own, taking into consideration:
  performance, price, rarity, history, etc?

Sorry for the reply all, but I've seen a few others with this problem as

2) You have changed your email address or have posted to the group using =

3) Your ISP's mail server is rejecting the incoming mail (maybe your =

4) Maybe PorscheFans has a bug in their mail server.

Subject: Turbo Transformation

Hey Allen,
	The rear lower valence for a 951 can be purchased from Parts Heaven for
about $320 last time I checked.  I installed one on my '88 944 NA.  It
really cleans up the rear end.  I too want to install a 951 front end
and I think it would be possible to trim and modify one to fit the 944,
but haven't found a 951 front end at the right price to attempt the
mod.  Not sure about using the glass reproductions.
	As an alternative, I have been trying to find a euro 944 front bumper.=20
It has smaller bumper guards and driving lights.  It looks so much
better then the U.S. bumper.  I think this mod would be very
respectable, easier and less costly than the 951 "nose job."  I have
tried to make contact with our 944 "brethren" in the U.K. and European
continent, hoping to find a used part.  No luck with that either.=20
(Hint, Hint to our overseas list members.:)
Hope this helps and good luck.

Subject: New Videos.

Hey dudes,

I probably should not do this, but I have a bunch of videos I am going =
to
copy into one nice tape.  These videos are from Japan and have the =
coolest
cars man has ever made.  I've been collecting these for a long time and
I want to put one really nice tape together with all the good stuff on =
it
(none of that drifting crap!).  Would anyone be interested in a copy?  I
do not want to make any money at ALL.  I also don't want to violate any
copyright rules, but it looks like these videos have no copyright and I
will be leaving all of the authors' names, etc. intact.  Also, I don't
think these videos are sold, just given free to magazine subscribers.

The cars include Skylines with 800hp.  Don't believe that number?  How
does 0-300km/h in 17 seconds sound?  I have seen it, it's wild looking
and sounds awesome.  Every video has a section on 0-300km/h as that is
the new standard by which all tuners are measured.  You see all the =
small
tuner shops out there running mid 20's, then the bigdogs come out, =
Greddy,
HKS, Blitz and now APEX.  It's a matter of saving face and HKS does not
dissapoint with the blistering 17 second run which I don't think anyone
is going to touch for a while.

They also have a lot of races such as when they pit a Carrera RS VS.
911 GT2 VS. 911TT VS. Ferrari F40 VS. Ferrari 328 VS Ferrari F355.
It's awesome to watch all of these cars drive down narrow twisty roads
full bore with traffic coming in oncoming.  They then drag race onto
a high speed oval and then they race against each other on a road track.

Have you ever seen a Ruf turbo blow the doors off a factory 911T to
the point where the factory turbo looks like a dot in the background?
Or how about seeing a Ruf Turbo pull up next to a Supra TT, all you see
from the wing cam is the 911 squat and the supra fall back and back=20
and back.

If you have not seen the Vielside Supra run, you haven't seen what boost
is all about.  It's an all-or-nothing car, 20hp then 820hp.  The car
lights up its tires when boost hits in 4th gear!

Anyhow, let me know if there is any interest in these.  Once again, I
am not here to make a profit, just to distribute these videos as the
publisher of it intended.  There is tons of advertising on the videos
for the Japenese magazines from which they came so I feel their intent =
is
to have them watched and the advertisements seen.  I am just aiding that
cause.

I am only making this offer to the 944 list.  See, there are privaleges
to having your engine up front :)

Subject: No charging of battery in 951!



     Someone please help!  My '86 951 has been in the shop for 2 days=20
     straight now, and labor fees are mounting.  A week ago, I noticed =
that=20
     my accessories were not activating on demand, and that my battery =
was=20
     reaching extrememly low charge levels.  I immediately suspected my=20
     alternator, but after taking it to my mechanics, they quickly =
(thank=20
     God) discovered that the voltmeter (potentiometer?) bulb in the=20
     instrument cluster was not lighting when I started the car =
(actually=20
     it lights before key is in start position, but you can see it when =
you=20
     stall too).  Apparently, this silly $1 bulb serves as a resistor in =

     the alternator's circuit and indicates that the field within the=20
     alternator is being excited before you start the car (or something=20
     like that--it seemed weird to me but I've had this fact confirmed =
by=20
     several individuals).  In any case, I was relieved that I wouldn't=20
     have to replace my alternator.
        But after 2 hours of labor to get in and out of my dash, my=20
     mechanic has discovered that the bulb is intact (this procedure was =

     still necessary since the bulb would not light when trying to pass=20
     juice through it directly from a loop under the hood).  Now I am =
told=20
     that my factory alarm's wiring (which was unplugged a few months =
ago=20
     due to false alarms that I didn't want to diagnose) is probably the =

     cause.
        Has anyone heard of this alarm/charging problem before?  My=20
     mechanic says that it's pretty common, but more prevalent among =
911's.=20
      Any ideas?  All suggestions and donations are welcome.

Subject: '88 951 Chipset

Hi all,
	I have a ?? about performance chips.  I recently purchased an 88 944=20
Turbo.  I specifically asked the previous owner if he had chipped the =
car and he said no.  However, in the glove box of the car was a bag =
containing some bulbs and fuses and WHAT IS THIS, a box with a chipset =
in it.  Also, the label on the bag says



AUTOTHORITY PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING
PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE FOR PORSCHE
PART NUMBER:  951.020.200.20
APPLICATION: 944t '86/7 STAGE 2

So, my ?? is....are the chips in this bag the performance chips or are =
the=20
performance chips in the car and these are the OEM.

There are 2 24pin DIP packages.  They have a printed number on them as =
well as ahandwritten note.

One says DME with number 1267355235
One says KLR with number 1267355138

The numbers are somewhat difficult to read so one or more digits may be =
wrong. =20


Greg;

I just chipped my 88 951 and the DME and KLR chips are in differnt DIP
packages, one is a 24 pin and the other is a 28 (?) pin. The chipset in
the glove box will not fit your car (at least the DME chip won't).=20

To make a good guess if your car is chipped or not, stand on the gas in
3rd from about 3k rpm. If the boost gauge swings to 2 bar, you probably=20
don't have a stock chipset. If it only boosts to ~1.8 bar, you probably=20
still have the stock chips. The only sure way is to peel the passenger=20
side carpet back and remove the boxes. The DME and KLR boards are each=20
enclosed in a two piece sheetmetal box.  Metal tabs hold the two halves
together, so if the tabs have been pried up somebody's been in there.

Call AutoThority at 703-323-0919 and ask 'em if they will exchange the
chips you have for some that fit an '88. You should also have a banjo
bolt with two copper washers on it to correctly install the chipset.

Good luck.

	I think you're okay here. What you're describing seems to be
	fairly typical for most 944/951's. Some of us are experiencing
	real mystical cooling problems that may never get solved. The flow
	rate of your radiator can be checked by your mechanic without
	removing it from the car. Also, the condition of your water
	pump can be checked as well by monitoring the "weep hole" and
	wiggling the impellor shaftto see if there's any play. Both these
	are pretty easy. How many miles does it have on it (the water
	pump, I mean?)

Hi all,=20

I am new to this particular list.  I just purchased a 1995 968.  It is
Aventurine Green with Light Gray interior.  The center armrest is just a
tray with a rubber mat.  It does not have the traditional, leather
covered, hinged "cubbie" -- like my 928 has.  I thought they all came
with this thin compartment as standard equipment?  Anyway, my question
is...
    Can I purchase one of these hinged cubbies and add it directly to
the center console that I have, or do I need to buy an entire new
console (from the switches in front of the shifter, all the way back)? =20
Thanks in advance,

I currently have a k-27 turbo that is blowing oil through the intake =

 All the turbos do this to some degree, however mine is rather =

probably going to rebuild (or get it rebuilt) soon (next month).

Windward and PowerHaus rebuild Turbos for ~$595.  They sell rebuilt =
turbos for
~$695.  For some reason this didn't seem right, so I thought I'd look =

further.

Yes, AutoMotion, Tweeks, and Auto-Atlanta have turbo rebuild kits.  If =

one of those kits, you might want to take the turbo to a shop to get it
balanced.  There are usually a few shops around all areas that rebuild =
diesel
turbos, so you may be in luck.  This might be the cheapest way to =
rebuild it.

The other option is to buy Turbo magazine (yes, I felt a little cheesy =
buying
it, but it did contain the info I needed).  It has adds from companies =
that
rebuild/repair turbos.  The going rate for most of the companies =
advertised
seemed to be ~$100 labor, and $150-$250 on parts (depending on what =
needed to
be replaced).  There are also many companies that sell kits to rebuild =
the
turbos (the kits are cheaper than the Porsche catalog prices)

This will probably be the option that I'll choose, however I'll have to =
remove
my turbo and look at it before I decide.

When I do remove the turbo, i'll update the list.

Sounds like a lean condition.  Could try adjusting the mixture setting =

the Motronic control unit - inside the box behind a plastic plug is a
rotary switch which has 8 detent positions.  This can be adjusted to add

These are the OEM chips.  So, the Autothority chips are probably
installed in the DME and KLR control units.

I've been away for awhile.  Quite busy.  Here are some tidbits from my
experience:

If you drive on the track, check your CV bolts frequently.  I have been
fighting a problem with loosening bolts for the past six months.  Twice =
after
track events, I've had a CV joint let go on the road.  Both time I had =

towed.  One of the times, several of the bolts had loosened, and two =
broke
off in the tranny output flange.  Not pleasant.  At Laguna two weekends =
ago,
I checked the bolts on Sunday morning.  When I did my post-event =
inspection
on Monday evening, I found ~7-8 loose bolts!.  Check these!!!

If your car backfires loudly on upshifts during heavy throttle (e.g., =
exiting
a turn on the track, or accelerating har on a fun street drive), check =
your
factory bypass valve.  Found mine had a blown diaphram after the Laguna =
event
a short time ago.  The bypass valve is there to help protect the turbo =
when
you lift.  A reliable source suggested that the 993 biturbo part is =
"better"
and fits into the stock 951 location.  I will give it a try.

I drove a student's 993 biturbo in mid-May at an AX school.  Lots of =
fun.
 Being an instructor has merits.  Rode in a 435 BHP 951 a couple of =
weeks
ago.  This is the car that was described in Excellence in an article =
written
by David Coleman back in '95.  The article was called "Tempestuous =
Turbo."
 Well, since that time, the car's owner has sold off all of the =
Autothority
and HKS stuff.  He had an engine built by Jon Milledge.  It has a Motec
ignition system.  This car was significantly faster than the 993 =
biturbo.
 Hopefully we'll get David to write a follow-up article so you can all =
read
more about it.  Milledge did a masterful job.  Next up will be =

Dwight Mitchell (I think).

For those who remember my March-ish posting about a larger oil cooler:

Recall that I bought a larger Mocal cooler to run in series with the =
factory
unit.  After several experiments, I determined that while it kept my oil =
very
cool, it restricted too much flow to the radiator.  The cooler I used is
ideally suited for nose-mounting in a 911.  I've decided to sell it...

I just installed a cooler advertised by Terba Tronics.  They make and =
sell
the popular Terbatrol for 911 cars.  The man in charge there has an =
Escort
Series 951, and developed a cooler for his car.  (Supposedly there were =
only
13 of these cars made-- the fastest of the factory racing 951s.  =
Milledge has
one too I think).

The Terba Tronics cooler is similar in height and width dimensions to =
the
Mocal unit which I bought, but it is much thinner.  It fits better, and =
is a
lot cheaper that the racing Mocal unit which I bought.  So far, it seems =
to
cool the oil without causing too much air restriction to the radiator.  =
Won't
know for sure until I can run the car hard on a really hot day.

In conjunction with factory cooler and the oil-air separator which I =
bought
from MIlledge, the Terba Tronics cooler is plumbed entirely with -12 =
lines.
 The whole packahe adds abot 1 quart of oil (est.)  Although I could =
have
used at least one of the factory lines, I decided to go with a full -12
braided set-up.  I bought the raw hose from Racer Wholesale.  Their =
price was
by FAR the best.  Fittings come with both the Milledge separator and the
Terba Tronics cooler, but I bought some special ones anyway for my =
specific
application.  These aluminum fittings are very expensive, so plan =
carefully,
and shop hard for the best pricing if you need anything special.  It is =
not
hard to fab up the hoses-- I bought the recommended soft vise jaws from =
Racer
Wholesale which makes it easy.

Money-wise, the Milledge kit is $400, and the Terba Tronics kit is $298 =
(I
didn't need anything but the cooler since I already had had the Mocal
installed).  -12 hose is about $7-8/foot as I recall.  If you want more
details, send me a direct e-mail-- after all of my development work, I =
can
now get the nose off of my car in less than thirty minutes!

Good luck...

The Bosch part number is only different in the last couple of digits
from the 951 to the 993.  I ordered a new stock bypass valve at the
dealership but when the part came in, it was the 993 part, so it must
be an official replacement.

So this is what you have:  A reservoir cap running to the gas can with a
