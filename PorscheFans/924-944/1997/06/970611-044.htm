>Hi friends,
>I would like to flush the brake fluid on my 944.  I am thinking of
>buying a Mityvac vacuum pump. Automotion/Imparts/Performance and
>Walmart sell it.  The price is very reasonable $20 - $30
>Can someone please tell me if this is a good tool to use or is there a
>better device out there?  How easy is it to use?  Can it be used to
>bleed the Clutch Slave Cylinder? 
>Thanks in advance.

>Greetings to all:
>In response to the brake bleeding question.
>I bought one and it is great, best $25 tool around. Last time I bled
>brakes with an assistant I got an eye full of brake fluid. No more with
>the vaccu-sucker. Here is the process:  
>
>1) car on level ground, tools and extra fluid available, and soap and
>water handy in case you spill some juice on the paint   
>2) open brake fluid reservoir in engine bay, cover with a CLEAN rag.
>3) put some liquid wrench on each calipers bleed port
>4) put a boxend wrench on the bleed port
>5) put vacuum tube on bleed port
>6) open port and suck fluid through until the color changes to the new
>fluid color
>7) check the reservoir in the engine bay so you don't draw air into the
>system, fill accordingly, don't over fill
>8) when you are pulling through all new fluid, maintain vacuum and
>close the port.
>9) on to the next caliper
>
>There is much debate on the order in which to bleed. I have always gone
>furthest to closest. PR,DR,PF,DF .
>Put in good fluid, I use ATE Super Blue. With the high boiling point I
>always have brakes at the track.
>While you are bleeding stuff do your clutch too.  I doesn't take too
>long for the average shade tree mechanic and is comforting to know that
>you have good fluid in the car. I would suggest that you test the car
>in a safe flat place before blasting down the road!
