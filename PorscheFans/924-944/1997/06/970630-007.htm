Neil, no, it doesn't sound like "pinging" to me, but if it was, why
would you decrease the octane??  

Think about this...is the noise made anytime when the car is stationary,
or only when driving??  It might be the converter, though they usually
make more noise when the engine is cold.  The cat. converter ceramic
element might be loose.  You can't always hear them rattle when you
"smack " it with a rubber mallet.  The noise can come and go on a
converter until the wear gets worse.  You can't drop off the exhaust
behind it and look in because the loose pieces are usually at the front
where you can't see because of the bends in the downpipe. 

A bad 02 sensor won't cause the DME to change the timing.

I probably will get some flak from this next statement, but I always use
87 octane on a NA 944 or 924S...I see no reason to use higher octane for
normal city driving, and have been doing so since 944's came out in
1983.  The higher octane is not going to help that engine put out
anymore power.  I'm sure that in some other climates (altitudes) there
maybe some benefit from a little higher, but I have never heard a 944 NA
engine "knock" and have never seen any problem whatsoever from using 87
octane consistently for street driving.  I just don't waste my money on
higher octanes.

You can call me at (817) 332-6547 and I wuill be glad to discuss your
problem.

Thanks...Don Istook
