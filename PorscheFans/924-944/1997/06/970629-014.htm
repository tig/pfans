Mike,

If I had to guess, it sounds to me like you have a broken pinion gear. 
 When they fail, the teeth break off at the root, creating a fairly 
large piece of hard metal rattling around in there.  I have examples 
where one of these pieces has lodged in an open diff's spider gears, 
locking them up good and fast, and in one example shattering the open 
diff case completely.

As often as not, when the pinion breaks it causes the pinion bearing in 
the aluminum case to spin, destroying interference and making the case 
pretty much worthless.  A lot of time, maybe one third of the time, the 
differential carrier bearing outer race in the case (i.e., left side) 
will also spin.  So there's a pretty good chance that it's more than 
just the diff cover plate.

Commercial plug: I build and rebuild 944 transmissions.  Let me know if 
I can help.

Kevin
