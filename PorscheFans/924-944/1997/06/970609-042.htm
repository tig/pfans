While there is obvious value of hearing about the good, bad or ugly
among parts merchants and other commercial resources, there is a slight
problem to consider before firing up the 22 mm flamethrower.

Its about impartiality and justice. 

If someone is using the list to make personal attacks, this will be ok
as long as the other part is also a listmember. In other public media,
like the press or tv/radio, there is a very strong tradition that
personal attacks do not get published without the other part is offered
a possibility to reply - but this is not the case on NG:s and
lists.           

I have no idea if Ron at Eurospeed is a member of this list, but if he
isn't two or three postings may have hurt him bad - without any means
for him to set anything straight. 

Regards
