Yes, it happens quite a bit.  You are smart to ignore them.  I find a
number of the minivan drivers really do drive those vehicles HARD.  I guess
after watching a weekends worth of sports with all those adds about
"sporty" cars with "wide" tracking Indy 500 power plants (yeah, right), it
must seem pretty demeaning to crawl into the family minivan, fight morning
rush hour (where is that empty road that is on the commercials!), spill the
coffee, grab a hand full of horn to ward off the guy yacking on the cell
phone, and every time you look into the rear view mirror, instead of seeing
that sexy spoiler that the commercials offer, you see the yellow "Baby On
Board" sign.

As a side note, a city in Brazil outlawed the use of cell phones in cars
(dangerous, you know) and after stopping and citing the offenders they
found 1/3 of the phones were that were being babbled into were fakes!
Seems that image is everything.

Post Script:

I have had a few guys tear past me at the lights thinking they had "shown
me".  I give them a respectable head start and then nail the Turbo and
rocket by.  You should see the deflated look on their faces.  Then I level
off at the speed limit (hey, there is no acceleration limit) and they go
rushing by.  I saw one guy do that to me in his truck.  A very short time
later I noticed he had attracted the attention of the highway patrol.
