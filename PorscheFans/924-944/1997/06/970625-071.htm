        I put rebuilt control arms on my '91 944S2 this spring due to a
frontend
        clunking noise which turned out to be worn ball joints. No
problems.

        Major cost benefit:  about $300 (each) vs. $1100 (each) from
dealer

        Talk with Part Werks of Chicago (Jay or Roger), New Lenox, IL at
815-462-3004
        Their cost is less $100 ea. when you return your control arm AND
after they
        magneflux it to ensure that there are no cracks so they can
rebuilt it.  I would
        ask any one I was going to get a rebuilt from what type of
inspection it went thru
        before it was rebuilt.  If they say someone else rebuilt them
and they just stock
        it, its time to check someplace else.
