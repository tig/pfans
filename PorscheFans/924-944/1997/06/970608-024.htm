I think the heat of desoldering may melt the plastic base if you leave the
spades in. I took them out first. Also the 2 diodes where they meet at
spade #9 are 2 seperate wires, not one continuous wire. So I would think
when you tug #9 apart you caould'nt avoid the 2 diodes seperating.

Yes, inside meant closest to relays.

BTW I have the turbo nose. I added the euro style driving lights to the
originally blanked out spot next to the fog light. I've wired my US
model 944 using the driving lights as my daytime running lights (There's
even a relay already in the panel for this specific purpose, since
Canadian cars have required DRL since 1990). So now during the day I can
still use the "high beam stalk flash to pass" feature with the fog lights
AND have DRL. In fact at dusk or dawn when it's not totally dark I can
have the fog AND driving lights on without the flipup headlights on.
