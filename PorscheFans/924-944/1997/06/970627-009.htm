Come on now. Doesn't everybody know that the best 944 model was the 1986 NA manufactured during the month of May? I never have to buy turbo parts, I save money on chips (they don't do any good on my car), the rotors are cheaper, the na model was ingeniously designed with smaller brake components to save on unsprung weight. The 'best' model has the all important MPG gauge instead of the turbo pressure gauge that everybody stares at. The 86na has the 'classic bumper' lines instead of the fragile turbo / S2 look. Think of all the extra weight in the lower rear valance, no wonder it needs a turbo - all the extra weight of the brakes, valance and other 'heavy' improvements.

Performance wise the 1986 (May) normally aspirated model would be victorious in an autocross that had no straights and was designed to have every chute end at 6250 rpm in 2nd gear of the 86 transmission. It would also help to have several wet spots at critical corners. Oh yea, the course will also include a K turn, parallel parking and at least 20% run in reverse.

In case you haven't figured it out I am being just a tad sarcastic. The 'best' car is a recurring theme here at the P-fans list. Did you ever notice that most people feel that their car is the best model? So I figured I could come up with the reasons why my model is the best. In case the above comments didn't sway you this seems to be a pointless discussion. 

I know - lets come up with a comparison chart. Lets see.. a rusted clapped out 88' 944 turbo S is worth 1 red 83 944 and a black 85.5 944 with swirl marks in 'B' condition. Man I'm on a roll here.

Can't we all just get along? Or do I have to call AJ? This is all about personal preference and how the car is needed to perform. If we all relied on peer pressure we would have traded our 944's for 911's long ago. Remember - popular wisdom says we are second class to the 911's!

Hey! This was supposed to be humorous!

PS - Fred - when the other reply said to use a grinder to clean off the gaskets he meant to use the scotch brite as the grinder pad. Don't use a grinder wheel!! It eats aluminium.
