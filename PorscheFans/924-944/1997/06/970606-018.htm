Hi Chris,

> I am going to attempt to change the brake fluid for the first time (mine 1st time, 

It's pretty easy. Here are a few ramdon pointers.

Make sure you use one of the elbow shaped adapters from the bleed nipple
to the vacuum hose. It might not seem like you need one, but you do. 
Without it, you'll get a lot of air bubbles. With the right one, you'll
only get a little.

The correct order is passenger rear, driver rear, passenger front, driver
front.

You have dual piston calipers. That means there is a bleed nipple on
each half of the piston. It doesn't matter which one you bleed first,
but you have to do both.

Keep the master cylinder closed all the time. The only time the cap should
be off is when you are adding fluid to it.

Check the M/C after each wheel has been bled. Don't let it get too
empty, or you'll have to go the job all over again.

Use a box end wrench on the bleed nipple. This way you are less
likely to round the nipple. It's either a 10 or 11mm.

> BTW, how much fluid do I need.  I bought 1 liter of ATE Super Blue.  Thanks.

1 liter is more than enough. Empty about 1/2 a mityvac cup from each 1/2
of the caliper, or 1 cup per wheel.

Don't get any brake fluid on your paint. It will eat the paint away.

Have fun. The first time it will take you about an hour. The longest
part is putting the car up on jackstands, and removing all the wheels.
A big jack, and air tools make that much quicker.

Enjoy,
