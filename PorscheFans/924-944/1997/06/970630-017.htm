Mike, my brother had the same problem last week. It was the pinion gear,
sheared off a few teeth. It cost $600 CDN for a used transaxle and $200
for the labor to swap it out.

> Well today wasn't good for the old transmission ('86 944 NA with 136000
> miles).  On my second run at an autocross, I exited a mid-second gear
> sweeper into a set of slalom cones.  At the second of five slalom cones, I
> found I had no power to the rear wheels.  Tried to put car back into gear
> only to hear a lot of grinding noises.  Pulled off line and coasted to the
> paddock area.
> 
> There I found lots of tranny fluid pouring out from the cracked cover
> plate to the differential area of the transmission.  This is the side
> that is removalable, the passenger side of the car, and has the
> drive/axle flange connected through it.

> Went home to get the trailer and tow the car to the shop where I left it.

> the side cover plate was just weak.  I would wager that something inside
> broke first since the cover is still in place, just cracked quite badly,
> and I have no drive to the rear wheels.  I think this is gonna be
> expensive but that's racing!
