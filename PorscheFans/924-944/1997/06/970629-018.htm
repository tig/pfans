     Hi Guru's,
     
     1) Have an '87 951 which has the supplemental waterpump for the turbo. 
      When I switch the engine off this thing keeps pumping water all 
     night.. surprized the battery didn't go flat!
        Anyway when I disconnect the temperature sensor, after about 30 
     seconds the little pump switches off.
        Now then, I guess the sensor is bad; but does the fact that it 
     takes 30 seconds to switch off after I disconnect the sensor mean that 
     the relay is also suspect?  How much do these sensors/relays normally 
     run?
     
     2) On an '86 NA 944, the gear lever hits the left side of the cutout 
     in the body.  I'd like to move the assembly such that this doesn't 
     happen.  No *OBVIOUS* way of doing this, at first sight.  Is there an 
     easy adjustment I'm overlooking?  I also need *ONE* center cap for a 
     phone dial wheel. (silver) there must be somebody with a smashed wheel 
     who can miss the center cap...
     
     3) Would you believe that the last idiot who had this NA 944 actually 
     went through the hassle of removing *ALL* the speakers before getting 
     rid of the car.  It's not as if these speakers are anything special... 
      Does anyone know which inexpensive speakers I can put in the doors so 
     that I can get the radio making some sensible moise again?  Has  
     anybody upgraded the sound system and wants to part with the original 
     speakers?  I just want it to be right before I sell the car.
     
     4) After all the above has been done, I'll be selling the vehicle.  
     Red '86 944 with *NEW CLUTCH, NEW WATERPUMP, ALL NEW TIMING BELT, 
     BALANCE BELT AND ALL ROLLERS/TENSIONERS* Leather interior (black) 
     sports seats, rear anti-roll bar, 126k miles; just run in and ready 
     for the next 126k!  Will be $5495 *CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP*
     
     Cheers,  Jan
