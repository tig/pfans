The rear sway bar drop links terminate in a stud coming from the camber 
eccentric.  If you don't already have a rear sway bar, you need to replace the 
camber eccentrics which do not have the stud, with ones that do.  You can try 
marking the orientation of the camber eccentric as you swap the part, and you 
should be pretty close if you're careful.  I've done this, seems to repeat 
pretty well.

The design is, to my befuddled mind, enormously stupid.  I don't know what 
benefit Porsche saw in conflating the rear camber adjustment with the sway bar 
drop link attachment.  Moreover, the drop link attaches in single shear, which 
even the most casual reader of Carroll Smith knows is one of the signs of the 
Apocalypse.

My friend has a 83 NA 944 without sway bar and we would like to upgrade to the
18mm turbo sway bar.

We already updated the front with a 27mm turbo without problem but we need 
some
info on the additional hardware and possible adjustment needed.
We know that clamp and bolts are needed to hold the bar to the frame and 
special
bolts to attach the drop links. 

It looks fairly straightforward to replace those bolts with the newer model to
attach the drop links. 
The only thing that I'm not too sure is by removing those bolt are we changing 
any
adjustment on the suspension. 
J. Pasha is mentioning in Excellence May 94 something about eccentric bolt and
some adjustment. 

I'm sure this upgrade has been done at least a dozen of times by a few members 
of
this list.

TIA

85.5 944 already upgraded with Turbos S sway bars
