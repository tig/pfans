What you have sounds like blown or missing oil bypass plugs.

Wow that sounds real bad, it is and easy to check and repair. The 944 head 
is shared with the 928 head (same basic part) there are two (2) oil galley 
openings in the head for the 928, when the head is put on a 944 the galley 
leads just back to the sump (slowly). When the head is installed the two 
(2) holes need to be plugged, you can do this by just removing the vale 
cover and they can be seen at the read of the head (not the front of the 
car the rear). If they are out you get the effect you talk about. Sometimes 
they just get blown out and can be found floating around the head.

Easy to check --- Easy to fix - Disaster if not repaired

        Hello;
I am new to the list today but in desperate need of advice.
A week ago I loaned my 87 944s to my son to drive a short distance.
when he returned he told me I should go out and listen to the engine.
He added that about 8 miles from home he started the engine and
the Oil preasure light came on. the guage showed 0 bar.
he said that about 5 miles from home (he didnt have sense enough to
park it, Right?), The noise started. I briefly started the engine and
confirmed his details. No oil pressure, lifters collapsed and rattling.
I had it towed to a repair shop whose owner I trust but who admits
to limited 944 knowledge. (mostly Mercedes and 911's).
He had recently rebuilt the head after a belt break.Prematurely in my
opinion.(he had replaced the belt a very few thousand miles ago.)
Back to the story: He , not knowing what to expect called his 944
guru ( at a dealer I think). The guy told him two things to check.
One was the pump, the other the relief valve. He checked both ,
could detect no obvious problems. he restarted the engine, it had what
appeared to be normal oil pressure and the lifters began to pump up.
He sai d " take it and put some miles on it and lets see what happens."
he also said he could not understand how it could have been the 7 or 8
miles without bearing damage but he can hear nothing nor can I. The
only thing I can detect (trusting my memory of guages before the incident)
is that the car seems to run a quarter of a mark hotter and no loger pegs
at 5 bar when cold. It starts cold at 4,4.5 bar and fals to the expected
1to 2 bar at idle hot. I have put maybe 100 miles on it since the incident.
Can any body guess what gives?
