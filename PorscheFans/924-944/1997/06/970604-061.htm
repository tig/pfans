I'm not sure this is contrary to theory.  From physics,
the whole mass-spring-dampener system will equilibriate fastest
when it's 'critically' damped.  More damping than this and the
response slows down, less damping and the body roll (and weight
transfer) overshoots and rebounds before it equilibriates -- so
the response slows down again.

Does anyone know if shock adjustments typically straddle this
critically damped point (which depends on spring stiffness and
roll inertia -- so "typical" is ambiguous)?

To physics, add the driver  -- maybe the ideal is to have
weight transfer equilibrate on the order of the driver response
(or 'perception') time, rather than as fast as possible.

Comments anyone?  I'd welcome a discussion of this.
