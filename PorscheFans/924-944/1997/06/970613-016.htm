I wanted to pass on the results of my complaint to the dealer about a minor
high pitch whine coming from the car between 60-70mph while dropping the car
off for the 30K service.  It sounded like a hard disk starting to go bad; a
soft whining noise.

The dealer's service rep nodded knowingly and asked if I needed the car back
that afternoon.  Next day he called back with the news that he suspected
that the "differential bearings" were bad and would like authorization to
tear into the transaxle.  I asked about cost ($1,500).  He also volunteered
that he had already contacted Porsche to get authorization to extend
warranty coverage to the car (it's a 94).

Days later, parts were on order and Porsche had agreed to cover the entire
repair cost.  Apparently a number of 968s went out the door with improperly
loaded "output shaft" bearings which could cause premature failure.  Once
the bearing has been damaged, you can't accurately tell the pre load or
cause.  The repair is fairly involved from what I can tell.  The dealer
mechanic who did the job spent many days, and has since left on leave to
join the Ferrari Monaco pit crew.  The transaxle is now extremely quiet,
although he put the exhaust back on so that when it got hot is vibrated
against the car.  I guess race mechanics are more experienced with running
gear versus mufflers.

The whole process took three weeks, but I was extremely impressed with the
support both the dealer and Porsche provided.  I would have been hopping mad
had they come back to me with a $3,000 transaxle repair at 30K, but the
treatment I received was world class.

The key inf. here is that if you have a 968 that has a transaxle that is
slowly getting louder, you may want to have a good dealer look at it.  I
wouldn't expect that Porsche will continue to cover the transaxle as time
moves on.

924 -> 951 -> 968

ps.  Checked out the Boxster when I dropped my car off.  It doesn't have any
leg room.  I'm 6'4, and there's no way I could comfortably drive the car.  I
hope the new 911s are better, or this 968 will need to last a very long time.
