I  just purchased my first Porsche!  It's a 1989 944 Turbo S in mint
condition.  

I have a few questions for an experienced 944 Turbo S owner:

1)  There is an intermittent rattle coming from the rear.  Its sounds
like "clack clack" like something is hitting the back window.  I have
checked everything I can think of inside the car including the jack.
Any ideas?  Maybe something underneath?

2)  I notice that when I brake and going less than say 5 miles per hour,
my steering wheel wants to turn right or left about 1/2 turn.  The
brakes also squeak once in a while at slow speeds while braking.  The
dealer said they were in good shape.  Any ideas? 

3)  I was considering getting a Weltmeister chip to increase the
horsepower.  Will this decrease the life span of the engine
dramatically?  And how much difference can I expect?

4) How difficult is it to change the clock light bulb?

5)  I live outside the Phila, PA area and I'm looking for a reputable
mechanic in the area?  Does anyone know one I can trust besides a
dealer? 

Any advice offered would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!!
