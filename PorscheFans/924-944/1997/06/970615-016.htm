I noticed a few notes about cam housing oil leaks.

Usually, the cam housing gasket does not start leaking on a 944 as long
as the housing has not been removed before.  Upon removing the housing
to do a valve job or stem seals or whatever, here is where the problem
usually starts, but the leaking gasket may not show up for a month, or
maybe not for several months.  When it does start leaking, you can look
and usually see where the gasket is sticking out where the housing bolts
to the head at some point along its contact point.

Here is what has happened:  When the cam housing is pulled off, it is
full of oil and almost impossible to get all of it out to clean it
without pulling all of the lifters and the end cap and front seals. 
When the housing is reinstalled, even if you have let it drain, oil
usually will still get on the new gasket.  This new gasket is graphite
impregnated and is very slick.  The mating surfaces have to be totally
dry.  If not, the gasket will "walk" on you and deform (even from around
the intalled pins), causing it to leak.  This normally does not happen
overnight, but after a considerable amount of time. When the housing is
again pulled off to inspect the leak, it is very obvious that the gasket
has moved--even from around the bolt holes.

The solution...make sure that the top cylinder head surface as well as
the cam housing mounting surface are totally free of all previous gasket
material and are clean and dry. Make sure the cam housing itself is dry
of oil (but be sure that the cam is lubricated as well as the lifters). 
Use no sealant on the graphite cam housing gasket.  That will only cause
problems.  

Another tip...if you are trying to remove the housing, be sure that you
tap your 6mm socket into each 8mm cap screw with a mallet to be sure it
is seated well and so you won't round off the screws.  Be careful on
installation...if there is any question as to whether any screws will
retorque, I suggest time-serting the hole (or holes) before you proceed
on the installation.  Time-serts are much better than heli-coils (in my
opinion) in this application.     

Any questions???   You can call me at (817)332-6547 during the day M-F

Best wishes...Don Istook.
