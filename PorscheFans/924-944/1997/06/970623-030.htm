One thing that no one ever mentions when talking about shimmy problems is out
of round tires.  Another thing to check is the A-Arm rear mounts.

I was having a shimmy problem and notice the right side a-arm rear mount was
almost seperated, it's like a rubber filled motor mount.  I replaced them and
it cleared up almost completely.  From that point the shimmy began returning.
 I was scared to death, I thought something was drasticly going wrong w/ my
suspension!  I was going on a weekend road trip and stopped by my mechanics
friday afternoon and we put it on a jack.  As I was looking under the car,
one of his guys (the one who does all the 944 Turbos, 3000 Gts, etc, spun on
of the tires and goes "you need new tires".  Sure enough, it was BAD out of
round.  Put new (actually used, but I bought them new) tires on, and smooth
as glass again.
