I bought this 944 at the beginning of this year (1/1/97). At the time, 
everyhting seemed fine. The engine purred and sounded like any decent 
o\porsche engine with over 72k should sound. THe car has been pretty well 
maintained. But recently, (since it became a little warmer) have noticed 
this strange sortof squeeling noise coming up when the engine hits about 
2500 rpm. At idle it is fine. No noise. Regardless of what gear I am in 
or how fast I am goind. The sound is only dependent on the rpm of the 
engine. At first I thought the sound was coming from the front section of 
the car (hood.) However, I might be mistaken. I don't believe it is the 
belts howevber it is possible. Help! What's wrong. The car drives fine 
but I get funny looks as I drive around. 
Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
