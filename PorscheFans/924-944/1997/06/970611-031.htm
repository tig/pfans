hi Nick

Yeah, me.

One trick I learned is that you MUST use one of the elbow shaped
adapters to connect the MityVac (MV) hose to the bleed nipple.
Although it seems like the hose itself makes a tight connection,
it doesn't, and allows a lot of air to leak by. With the proper
adapter (3 come with the kit) a lot less air gets into the line.

Some air still gets into the MV hose (either from around the
bleed nipple threads, or maybe from the bleed nipple to the
adapter) but not that much. That's why I think the MV is OK
for changing brake fluid, but not bleeding calipers or clutch
hydraulics.

Then it's pump pump pump on the MV handle, and I have no problem
filling 1 container of fluid per caliper (I have dual piston 
calipers, so I bleed 1/2 a container from each 1/2 of the caliper).

Don't open the bleed nipple more than about 1/4 - 1/2 turn.
Don't let the MV container lay on it's side. If it does you can
suck brake fluid into the MV unit. I use an old shoe to stick
the container in. This way it doesn't fall over, and I can
use both hands on the MV unit.

All in all, the MV is OK. I don't love it. If I were to do it
all over again, I would try a pressure bleeder. However, I have
the MV and it does work. I don't have to bother my wife to help
me bleed brakes anymore.
