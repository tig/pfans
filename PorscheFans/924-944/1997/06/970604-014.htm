I don't think you can do this because the bearing caps and heads are 
align-bored.  I don't know that blanks are available, apparently not. 
 In any event, you'd have to have someone like Ollies or CE redo the 
bore for you.  Try giving them a call, perhaps they have an idea.

Subject:	924 part needed!

I have a problem.  And I'm not talking about the one I see the
psychiatrist for, either.  My rebuild was nearly complete when my
friend noticed that the rearmost main bearing cap on my 82 924 Turbo
was cracked.  I think the PO had the car set up too low and whacked
the oil pan just right.

Does ANYONE out there know ANYONE who might have one? Unfortunately,
the factory only sells them with the entire block.  I have called no
fewer than fifteen junkyards and parts suppliers, to no avail.

Thanks for any help you can offer.


Dave
