<<While I am writing to you guys maybe someone can shed some light on
the following myth going around here :
apparently in 1983 Porsche built a 944 they called Lux. According to
what I heard they only made 500 Nos. and all of them were gold from the
outside, brown stripe fabric interior and yellow dials.
Now, is that true ???? If yes, what else is different in this 944
compared to others of a similar age ?
I would really like to get to the bottom of this and appreciate any
input.>>

Hi Joern,

In the book "Porsche 944" by Julian MacNamara, the highlighted car is an
'84 944 LUX. Apparently it is not a myth! 

Two of the features he mentioned that were not a part of my '84 944 were
headlight washers and "long range driving lights recessed into the front
bumpers which also serve as flashers in daylight conditions when the
main lights are retracted." The latter may have been a standard feature
on Euro 944s, but I don't think headlight washers were offered in the US
in '84. I've also never seen a 944 in the US that is the same color. It
is somewhere between bronze and silver, almost linen metallic.
