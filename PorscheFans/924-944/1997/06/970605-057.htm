It's close to the best deal you will ever get for $36. Panorama alone is
worth that, plus you'll get to meet a lot of nice folks in your area with
Porsches and if you're interested, the PCA regions conduct drivers
education events, autocrosses, rallies and social events. The key is to
join and then get your self, your spouse (if you have one) and your Porsche
to an event.
