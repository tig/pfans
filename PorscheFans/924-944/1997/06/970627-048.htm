My usually reliable air conditioning man say he gets a hint of freon out
the vents when he test the AC on my '86 944. He thinks the evaporator has
developed a leak - the reason being that over the years a little bit of
condensate water sits in the bottom of the housing and eventually reacts
with the aluminum. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or is this freon leak possible
creeping in from somewhere else?

It appears the replacement job is a bear. According to his manual 6.5
hours of labor. And he doesn't want to do it. Has anyone else done this
job? I intend to tackle it myself if I can get by with out special tools,
etc.
