Hi everyone,
I'm currently restoring my 77' 924 and I need to replace the heater 
blower fan. I hot wired it and it does not work. My question is how do 
you get to the darn thing to take it off? Second question is if anyone 
know where I can buy a new fan motor, or rebuild mine. I heard from this 
other guy that the bushings in the motor mite be whats wrong with it, is 
this write?Any suggesions will be welcome. Haynes manual is not so clear 
on this.
This is my first P car and when I got the car it was ready for the junk 
yard. After I boubht it I have replaced 
1)All four shocks ( by my self took three days and many busted nuckles)
2)New front rotors and brake pads
3)Engine head rebuild 
4)All new belts 
5)all new horses
6)new warm up regulator
7)New fuel pump
8)New fuel accumilators
9)Exterior lights
10)Two front seats (the originals looked sooooo bad)
11)Four new tires 195/60HR 14 and alighnment

I still need to take care of few other things, Don't even ask how much 
I've spent on it.I feel good that I saved this Porsche from going to 
heaven/hell.I mite be looking at a cluch job very soon. Wish me luck. I 
need it. Thanks again. You guys are great...

long live porsches....Yehan Wijesena
