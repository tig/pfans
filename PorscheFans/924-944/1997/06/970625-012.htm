Hi Fans

Ref. Generic Belt Tensioning tool

I have a Snap-On tool catalog and it has a belt tensioning tool that has
3 fingers and a dial.   It appears to works syringe fashion where you
push on a ball like knob and the middle finger separates from the other
outer 2 fingers enough for you to slide this device onto the belt in
question.  I called the Snap-On people in Carlsbad CA and they said it
cost $113...  this may have to be calibrated to Porsche units.   This is
probably what the Eurospeed has done and they may have replaced the
dial.

(For you picky types note the use of the word "probably"   and    "may"
in the last sentence.)

BTW   that tool is sold by Snap-On but not made by Snap-On same as the
Porsche tool is not made by Porsche

In my opinion I can only applaud efforts to force gouge pricing down and
since there are kind souls here on this list who are about to test this
tool from Eurospeed  I will buy one based on their recommendation.

This list is a real help to me and I thank you all for your continued
efforts to improve the Porsche car and its maintenance, especially the
list master. Bravo !


                                 Thanx  / Ed
