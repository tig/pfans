Hi,
First I like to thank John Allen for forwarding some messages and 
thanks to those who replied to my clogged injector questions. Thanks 
guys!
Now for my most curious problem (curious to me anyway). When I turn 
the key to shut the engine down nothing happens, it just keeps on 
running. Even with the ignition key removed it just won't quit.
During this phase I can't raise the lights.
Then when I hit the gas or shift into reverse (with the ignition key 
out) the engine will die, but the temp gauge and the gas gauge keep 
their reading.
Now when I hit the switch to lower the window the fuel pump kicks in! 
A couple of weeks ago I replaced the fuelpump relay but I was careful 
and disconnected the battery so I wouldn't shortcircuit anything. The 
car ran fine untill today. I also replaced the battery a while back.
What gives???

oh...it's an '84 924

TIA

Manouchehr
