Well, the saga continues.  The  throttle position sensor was NOT
the problem, so at full throttle the fuel pump is still going to limp mode.
Good news is that my car is NOT overheating and the AC is ok.  No new radiator
and no compressor needed.   I got the AC recharged and the cooling system F&Fd
anyway, so my summer prep is pretty much done.  Running Mobil 1 20W50.
My mechanic says that the computer, for some reason, is seeing overboost
though the guage says that boost is ok.  We have to put a real guage
on the manifold to check and see what the real pressure is.
Fortunately the car is stilll driveable as long as I don't floor it.  This
weekend
I am going to check the connection at the computer since the sensor line
looks ok at the manifold.
I got some D40M2s the other day, used on the track once, and other than
cosmetically they look fine.
Does anyone in Indy (Indianapolis) know of a place that does on-car wheel
balancing?  I get
my LF ball joint rebuilt on Monday, then I get the tires installed and get an
alignment.

PS:  Which hose was coming loose?  Where is it on your car?

123k miles on '86 951

My Indy car is in the garage.  I lost the LF suspension when AJ Foyt
got mad and ripped the wheel off and it only seats one anyway so that is
why I can't give you a ride in it today.  A.L.
