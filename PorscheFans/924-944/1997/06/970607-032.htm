Yep, that happened to me, and I spent about 10 frantic minutes trying to
figure out how the spades went in the bakelite base.  It was like a
dimestore children's puzzle.  I should have inserted a caution.  If you
leave the spades installed in the base while you desolder, it should stay
together, but you will have to fiddle to get the #9 spade out (lift the
others up a little - makes sense if you see it).

Agreed.  That's the best route.

Just to verify:  When you say 'inside leg of the fuse' do you mean the 
leg closest to the relays?  That is the leg I used.  BTW, the actual 
relay coil winding draws well under 1 amp, so don't worry about excessive 
draw.  The actual lamps themselves are on a separate circuit.

Even if you have heated seats, it is fine to tap into that circuit, since 
the relay winding draws a tiny amount of current.  But there are plenty 
of alternatives, should you be concerned.

I went crosseyed looking at the factory microfiche wiring diagrams to 
verify I wasn't going to melt down my electrics..  ;-)

I am glad the mod worked for folks.

Cheers,

upgrade the headlights to Hella 55/65W for lighting perfection) ;-)
