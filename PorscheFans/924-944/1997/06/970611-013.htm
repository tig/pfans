My girlfriend recently bought a 95 968 cab, and noted the warnings in 
the manual about using the tonneau cover when the top's down.  I 
talked to a couple of owners and they felt that it wasn't as critical 
as the manual would have you believe, at least at speeds upto a 100 
mph <g>.  One guy has a 92 968 cab and doesn't usually put the cover 
on and his top still looks like now.  I guess I wouldn't worry about 
the tonneau cover too much, unless you're going on a long highway 
drive.  YMMV.
