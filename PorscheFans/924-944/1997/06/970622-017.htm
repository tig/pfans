I wish this thread would end because a spend to much time going through this
list as it is, but w/ the comment about role models I feel I must contribute
my $0.02.

I don't believe sports stars should be frowned upon for not being a good role
model.  They are entertainers.  Parent's and teachers are role models.  With
the amount of adrenaline involved in sports, people will get pissed off some
times and unfortunate situations will arise, but you can't call someone a bad
role model when there not a role model.  The only time athletes (drivers are
athletes) should be viewed vaguely as role model is when the do something
stupid, then you tell kids "see, even though he's such a great (driver, QB,
runner, whatever), that doesn't mean he's a good guy".

Sorry to coninue this thread.
