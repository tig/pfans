	I recently replaced my driver's side control arm with a rebuild from
Dynamic European Technologies. I was able to do the job myself with help
from the list, and they sent me back $100 of the $250 price upon the return
of my old unit.(713)-661-2780 .

	I am a satisfied customer and others have seemd to be form comments on the
list. I'm passing along the procedure in case you need it.

Following is a prodedure that I wrote after I replaced my 86' Turbo =
control arm.

944 Control Arm Replacement Procedure
				    (from 1985/5)


GENERAL INFORMATION:

The purpose of this procedure is to supply basic but complete =
information for the removal and installation of 944 control arms (85.5 =
and newer). The Procedure is intended for the amateur/novice home =
mechanic with a basic set of metric tools.
How do you know if you need to replace your ball joints/control arms? =
There is a rubber boot that encloses the joint, inspect the boot for =
cracks or other damage. Another sign is clunking in the left or right =
front suspension, it starts off very subtle but will get worse as time =
goes on. I damaged my left ball joint when I hit a pot hole, it hit real =
hard!
Do I need to replace both arms at the same time if only one is bad?  It =
is not necessary but if you have the funds it would probably be a good =
idea.
=20
Prior to the 1985/5 model year steel control arms were installed in the =
944.
Since the 1985/5 model the control arms were changed to the present =
light alloy aluminum design. Also the rubber bushing/bearing mount was =
redesigned and the caster eccentric modified. As a result of this design =
change, the ball joint is not available as a separate part. The complete =
arm must be replaced, or it can be sent out and rebuilt (not authorized =
by Porsche). One of the rebuilders offers a three year warranty. Call =
and ask about their rebuilding techniques, not all do it the same and =
quality varies. These rebuilt arms are NOT recommended for serious =
racing, I would buy a new unit or get the steel Fabcar arms with the =
replaceable ball joint and high quality bushings.

Recently PCNA has lowered the price of their control arms to compete in =
the rebuilding market. The difference in $$$ between a rebuilt unit and =
a new one is not all that great, so shop around to get the best price. =
Keep in mind that the new part carries a three year warranty backed up =
by Porsche. When purchasing the arm, make sure that you have the right =
part number for the model and year of your car. (see the list below)

PREPARATION:

1. Prior to removing parts, apply penatrant to all fasteners, let =
chemical soak, repeat. (Rost Off by Wurth or PB works great) Make sure =
that you have all required parts that are needed for the job, before you =
start.

TIME ALLOTMENT: About 2.5 hours (without any major problems)

2.TOOLS/SUPPLIES: 10mm, 13mm, 17mm, 19mm wrenches/sockets
			rubber mallet/hammer
			scribe or similar tool for marking eccentric adjustments
			#2 phillips screwdriver
			anti-sieze compound
			torque wrench (mid size) ie. Snap On w pivot head

NEW:

Fabcar Racing Control Arms @ 1.800.934.9112
PCNA Dealers $ 355.00 list (look for dealer discounts 10% - 25%)


REMOVAL:

2. Raise side of car that you will be working on with jack, if you are =
changing both arms, raise front of car and secure with properly rated, =
good quality jack stands. Also utilize the correct jack points (refer to =
owners manual). Emergency brake on, rear wheels blocked and negative =
terminal disconnected from battery. (better safe than dead !)

3. Remove wheel(s)

4. Remove bottom engine cover protective plates.(several bolts & screws =
requiring 10mm socket & phillips screwdriver.
=20
5. Mark with scribe, the eccentric bolt alignment to arm (rear of =
control arm, and rear control arm bushing assembly alignment to chassis. =
It may be necessary to replace this bushing assembly, check for wear and =
rubber deterioration. It is important that this eccentric bolt is marked =
prior to removal for proper caster alignment. This does not guarantee =
that the alignment will not change, there will be different tolerances =
upon assembly (new parts bushings etc.).=20

6. The following is a list of fasteners that will be removed during this =
	procedure: a. sway bar clamp nuts/bolts(2) b. Sway bar bushing assembly =
nut/bolt/rubber bushings(2)/washers(2)(center of A-arm). c. Pinch =
bolt/nut on bottom of spindle (secures ball joint shaft to spindle). d. =
Front control arm nut/bolt (attaches front of control arm to bottom of =
cross member). e. Rear control arm bushing mount =
assembly/bolts(2)/washers(2) (attached to chassis) f. eccentric rear =
control arm bolt/nut/washer (connects control arm to rear control arm =
bushing mount.


7.TOOLS:   10mm, 13mm, 17mm, 19mm wrenches/sockets/extensions
		rubber mallet/hammer
		scribe or similar tool for marking eccentric(caster) adjustments
		#2 phillips screwdriver
		anti-sieze compound
		torque wrench (mid size)

8. Remove bolt/nut from bottom of spindle/strut.

9. Remove bolts(2)/nuts(2) from sway bar clamp bracket.=20

9. Remove nut/washer/bushing from top of sway bar bushing assembly, tap =
bolt out from top of a arm, remove lower washer/bushing and bolt. (check =
these bushings for wear and rubber deterioration, if in doubt, replace. =
If you do this, I would replace all the bushings at the same time.

10. Remove front control arm bolt/washer/nut from cross member. This =
bolt is rather long, the steering tie rod/spindle assembly must be moved =
in order to slide the bolt out. Don=B9t worry there is plenty of play =
here. Tap on bolt to get it started, it may have to be taped through =
while moving the arm side to side.

11. Remove rear control arm bushing mount bolts(2)/washers(2)=20

12. Discard the the self locking nuts that you have removed.

NOTE 1: If you are NOT replacing the rear bushing mount assembly it is =
only necessary to remove the front most nut/washer of the rear part of =
the control arm. You can then transfer this assembly to the new control =
arm without moving the eccentric bolt position, relative to the =
bushing/bearing mount.


NOTE 2: If you ARE removing the rear bushing mount from the eccentric =
bolt, make sure the eccentric bolt center is marked in relation to the =
rear of the arm! You will transfer this mark to the new arm. Remove both =
nuts from eccentric and mount, remove from arm.

14. With a rubber/plastic mallet tap the outer end of the control arm so =
that the ball joint spud comes out of the bottom of the spindle/strut =
assembly.

15. Control arm should now be free. Remove

FYI: I know I am making a big deal concerning the eccentric and it seems =
confusing, but it will all come together when you actually see how it =
works.=20

INSTALLATION:

NOTE 3: All locking nuts must be replaced. The locking nuts are not =
reusable!
NOTE 4: I use anti-seize on the bolts, thus preventing future problems =
with stuck nuts.

16. Transfer scribe mark from old a-arm to replacement arm.(this part is =
not necessary if you did not replace the rear bushing mount).

17. Attach eccentric bolt/bushing mount to rear of new/rebuilt control =
arm, depending on what you removed. Align scribe marks of eccentric to =
arm, replace with new nuts and torque to spec, making sure that marks =
stay aligned!

18. Place arm in position, fitting front arm bushing in cross member. =
Align bolt holes and replace bolt/washers/nut.

19. Attach rear bushing mount with bolts/washers to chassis; align to =
scribe marks, torque to spec.

20. Position ball joint spud so it fits into bottom of spindle assembly, =
making sure that spud is pushed up all the way. Replace bolt and nut.

21. Attach sway bar bushing mount into control arm, replace with new =
locking nut.

22. Attach sway bar bushing clip to chassis bracket. The shock may have =
to be depressed in order to align the bolt holes. I used the jack to =
depress the control arm/strut. Replace bolts and new locking nuts.

22. Once sway bar mounts are positioned correctly, torque all locking =
nuts to specs.

23. Replace wheel. Tighten nuts in a star pattern in order to attach =
wheel properly.

24. Torque all nuts to spec. (see below)

25  Check all work for mistakes, and those extra fasteners; where did =
they go?

26. lower car, remove rear tire blocks, and enjoy those new control =
arms.

26b. Test drive car. How does it feel? If you followed this procedure =
carefully, you will probaly not experience any alignment problems. When =
you replace your tires you can have an alignment shop check the front =
out and make sure it is in spec. MAKE SURE YOU USE A REPUTABLE SHOP THAT =
IS FAMILIAR WITH PORSCHES ESPECIALLY 944=B9S. JUST BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE =
BIG $$$ INVESTED IN EQUIPMENT DOES=B9NT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THEM =
QUALIFIED TO DO WORK ON PORSCHES!
This is one of the reasons that I do as much work as possible on my =
Porsche;
very few mechanics will take the time and care that is required to =
maintain your car properly, like you would.=20

27. Pat yourself on the back; you did that your self!=20
