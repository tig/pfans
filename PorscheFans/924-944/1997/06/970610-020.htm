Regarding a recent email about "Cam belt tensioner NOW for rent", since the  
tool will be out until the July or August time frame, is there someone in the  
Washington, DC area that has one and is willing to rent/assist/advise  
regarding the use of the "P920-whatever it is" tool? This would obviously  
involve compensation and immense gratitude (whichever you value more).

For that matter, since PCA is based near me in Alexandria, VA, wouldn't it  
be a good idea for them (or the local Potomac Region) to have a special tools  
inventory and library for rent/loan/whatever so our lives with these cars  
will be less stressed and expensive? This would obviously involve the usual  
deposits, fees, and legal disclaimers.

Am I off base here?

Also, anyone know of a good (accessible) text resource for 944 and 951  
repair beside the Haynes manual and fiche version of the shop manuals?

Your input is appreciated.

Thanx,
