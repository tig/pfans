I'm curious as to what you noticed the most.  Was it the power difference
or was it just that you were going much faster into the corners.  Did you
find yourself getting scared at all?  Were your lap times significantly
faster in the Turbo than the NA?

I'm no expert on the R1's, but aren't the pressures supposed to be higher?
There is a document on the web somewhere called "The car and feeding of
BFG R1's" in which they mention a higher pressure to be run, unless
it's the old 226 compound R1's.  In autocross, when I ran R1's, I ran
32/32 which worked quite well.  But, if you didn't have any unusual wear,
your settings are likely fine.  I think they recommend the higher pressures
to help cure the EGOD.

From all of the 89 Turbos I've seen and 88 Turbo S cars, there is enough
adjustment to make a 17" tire look like it's kissing the fender lip in
the rear with the factory adjustment without indexing.  I gave my ride
height figures a while back if anyone has them handy, you can provide
them to Paul.  I measure from the ground through the center of the wheel to
the fender lip.

If you are running a street car, you may want to tone down the front camber
a bit.  Most tire experts say that camber is not the usual culprit of
tire wear, but rather toe is.  Your toe settings are fine and will toe-out
slightly under normal driving conditions (unless you used the pressed
method to set toe during the alignment).  After much debate, I ended up
with the following settings and to my GREAT surprise, the pyrometer is
showing good results with the Hoosier tires:

		Camber		Caster		Toe (unpressed)
Front		-1.0d		2.5d		+15m total
Rear		-1.5d				0m total

Having driven mostly FWD and AWD cars since I started Solo II and Solo I,
I tend to be very easy on the front tires so maybe that's why my pyrometer
readings are ok, or perhaps it's the construction of the Hoosiers???  On
the Talon, to get similar results as the Porsche, we had to run -3.0
degrees of camber up front!

I think my wheels are arriving soon from Scotty and my Hoosiers are here so
I can hopefully catch that damn 911TT in my class and apparently a new
Boxster that is showing up this weekend!

Don't disconnect it.  The really hard core "old-school" guys will tell you
that modulation by your foot is the best method, blah, blah, blah.  The
only time that ABS is a problem is when you are riding the curbs and braking
at the same time.  It fools the computer into thinking the wheel is locking
(which it likely is since it's probably lightly loaded) and backs off the
brakes giving you a very scarey feeling.  Once you are used to the ABS
system, you will find that Porsche's ABS system is much, much better than
most any other car's system.  The ABS unit on my 89 Turbo allows the tires
to howl before alerting with the tell-tale chirps.  This means that the
ABS unit is allowing the tires to reach the desired slip angle of maximum
braking before releasing pressure and re-applying pressure so if you like
modulation, you can still do it, but if you overstep the limit, it'll be
there to help you out.  I've had this conversation with many people back
in the Talon days and some driving habits have to change to take advantage
of ABS, email me private at fkassam@direct.ca and I'll dig those out if
you want to read 'em.
