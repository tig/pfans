Hi, I have just joined the club, and this is my first mail to the list.
Some tips from a 944 Turbo expert would help.

I have been driving a 924 -1979 model for the past 6-7 years, and have
tremendous fun with it. Other then some minor problems eg water pump, water
leaking, I have no major compliant about the car. Infact it is serve me
very well the last years.

I am about to own another one, a 944 Turbo-1986 model. Can anyone give me
some advice on the car? What to look out? What to expect? I've heard about
over heating problem with the Turbo, is it real? I am writing from
Singapore, and the temperature here is constantly between a low of 25 and
high of 33 degree celsius. I welcome any comments about 944 Turbo.

Thanks....Jit (Singapore)
