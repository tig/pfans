  Spent the better part of last night fixing the door handles, you know, 
sqeeeezing my hand behind the window guide rail inside the door to maneuver 
the two control rods from the door handle, and the reverse to install. What a 
pain, literally. The factory manuals say to remove the window, but the details 
must be in the 924 manuals. I really really hope I don't have to remove the 
handles again, but if I do, I want the job to be a bit easier. What is the 
best way to remove the door glass? Is it as simple as removing the trim and 
squeege, unbolting the scissor at the fixed pivot on the door frame(I think 
this is what the mechanism is called?), and raising the window until the 
scissor falls off the rails on the bottom of the window? It would then be easy 
to remove the window guide rail to gain access to the handles..
 
  Now that I have a fully functional electric lock system, on to the A/C 
system. Can the rubber hoses be rebuilt with simple tools? I am thinking of 
using barrier hose, and hose clamps to replace the existing rubber. In several 
catalogs for Sanden replacement compressors, there are pictures showing 
fittings for the compressor, cut tubing, and hose clamps. Is this an 
acceptable method? The barrier hose is sold at the local auto store to be used 
in an A/C filling system, I could cut it to length.  I would like to replace 
the A/C compressor shaft seal while I am at it. Is this available? Is there a 
rebuild kit for the OEM compressor? I am also replacing the dryer, using the 
NAPA part number that Kory Krofft posted on June 4th, it is only $26.99! 
Thanks for the info Kory! I also need to fix the A/C switch, it doesn't stay 
in. What is so special about this switch that new replacements cost several 
hundred? I will attempt to remove it, and repair, but may need parts for it. 
Any advice? or do I just look for a used one?

TIA,
    Ezra
