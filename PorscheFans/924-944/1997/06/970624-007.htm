You didn't ignore this did you!  I seem to have been dropped from the
lists again (all of them).  Just trying to see if this is true before
re-suscribing again.  Really wonder why we all have to re-subscribe
frequently?  It was fine until about two months ago.  Now I have 
re-subscribed three times!

     Hey folks, I'm back again (stop your groaning).
     
     I have aslo experienced the high-speed shimmy phenomenon in my '86 
     951.  It comes and goes intermittently, and I have noticed that its 
     occurence usually has someting to do with the type of road surface I'm 
     driving on.  While I may feel a slight shimmy on those cream-colored 
     slabs of "smooth" concrete, the shimmy will completely disappear as 
     soon as the road surface changes to fresh pavement, or vice versa (I 
     can't remember exactly).
     
     Also, I don't think this is a serious problem that Porsche neglected 
     to correct before releasing their products from the factory.  I may be 
     wrong, but isn't it reasonable to expect more vibrations and 
     sensations in our steering wheels since our suspensions are a lot more 
     sensitive anyway?  I mean, we're not driving land-yachts that bounce 
     and oscillate with an amplitude of 3 feet after hitting bridge seams.  
     Porsches have tight suspensions that are precision-tuned to give the 
     driver the best responsiveness and road-feel.  With wide tires that 
     tend to hunt road grooves, our cars will inherently be more sensitive 
     to the slightest shudder or tire movement, and our suspensions and 
     steering may exaggerrate this.  But that doesn't mean I think 944's 
     are supposed to wobble at 65.  I favor flaws in tire wear/balance over 
     flaws in our cars.
     
     Just my $.02
     
     Ben

Subject: Re: Re-aligning bumper
X-Info: I O Systems, Inc. -- http://www.ioio.com/



     I just noticed that the front bumper on my 87 944S appears to have 
     been pushed in on the passenger side (as if it was "tapped" by another 
     car).  Is there a way to push it back out?
     
                Cosmetically, you may be able to push the right side back   
                out a bit, but remember that once the bumper shock has      
                compressed, it usually tends to stay in that compressed     
                position.  You may have to find a way to physically         
                separate the shock from the bumper in order to match both   
                sides again--at least visually.
