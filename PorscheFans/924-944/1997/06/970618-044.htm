I could say Dale because Michael wouldn't know how to shift the car (this is a
joke, the f1 vehicles have shifting paddles on the wheel).  However I don't
know if NASCAR uses syncronizing transmissions.

Or, Michael because the the GT1 is more like a f1 car (mid engine, rear
suspension, lightweight)

In reality, the amount of track/race driving that these guys do is phenomenal.
 Both are very good at what they do.  It would be a more fun race if the two
had a week to practice with the car and the track and then see which one wins.

It kind puts an odd feeling in me when I think about the amount of track time I
get in a year versus the amount of track time those guys get.  Gee, if I go to
the track 6 times a year, and drive the track about 4 hours every time, I've
only gotten 24 hrs of track time.  Both those guys probably get atleast 24 hrs
a week...(well, Michael probably does at Monza, I don't know where Dale
practices)

Ahhh, to be able to drive and get paid for it...
