anything Steve Albini touches... Big Black, Shellac, that one PJ Harvey
album...

I listened to Big Black's "Tiny King of the Jews" about 20 times in a row
once... it's off of "Songs About F!*king" which is one of the best ROCK
records ever, and I do mean rock... I think its 10 years old by now, but no
matter...

BUY IT! If you don't like it, and you like to rock, I'll refund your money...

on the Shellac album "At Action Park" the 3 band members don't even gt
instrument credits, they are in charge of things like "mass" and "velocity"
which frees me up to speed!

on a lighter note, all John Coltrane records make great driving music... I
once listened to "Love Supreme" for about 3 months in a row after I bought
it...
