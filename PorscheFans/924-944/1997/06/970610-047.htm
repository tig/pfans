The 944 series has a two stage radiator thermoswitch for the fans.  
Depending on the year of the car, when the temperature gauge inside the 
car reaches the second white (2/3) mark, the second fan will come on 
(earlier cars) or both fans will switch from low to high speed (late cars).
Keep in mind the second stage rarely activates unless the the weather is 
really torrid or you are sitting in traffic with the A/C on.

You can check the the thermoswitch for proper functioning by unplugging 
the connector and bridging the appropriate contacts to see if your second 
fan activates.

Try substituting a known good fan relay to see if this solves your 
problem.  Fuses can look good and not be, so try another.

Please do not wire your second fan in with the first.  The fuse will 
surely blow, and it does not address the source of the problem.

I hope this information is helpful.
