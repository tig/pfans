I plan to take my 89 Turbo in tomorrow to have the coolant checked for
exhaust gases.  I suspect I will be doing a head gasket very soon.

If I drive very casually the coolant does not get to foamy and the level
seems good, but when I get the turbo charger spinning under load it seems
to get a lot more bubbles in the coolant overflow tank and the level seems
to increase.  Yes, I know there is air in the system, but I was not able to
bleed it successfully last time.  It would be nice if it was related to the
pin leak I had with one of my hoses.  Hey, I wonder if the water pump can
fail like that?  Any ideas?

So, is there a FAQ available for head gasket replacement?  Or how about
some procedures that some one has already written?

Thanks to everyone for their support and help with my clutch too!  It
drives so well now, just wish the coolant system wasn't carrying on.

Marv
