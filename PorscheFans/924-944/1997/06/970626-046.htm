1.  to dial the uk, there is a 6 hour time difference (from Central time add 6), 
for those of you using ATT the number is 011-44-1(city code)-(phone number).  My 
girlfriend lives there and i call twice a day (not really that often). for 
example (011-44-1638-55-5555) this would be a number in the mildenhall area(used 
to live there).

2.  if the wheels are shaking badly at about 60 and stop about 80 and the 
balancing and alignment did no good make sure all the components are correct.  
on mine it was the tie rod that was bent causing a very bad tire shake at the 
above mentioned speed. the outer tie rod was 20.00 from Zims. time invested was 
about 3 hours. p.s. if you are going to change your tie rod ends buy 1.  a tie 
rod puller, 2. a VERY heavy hammer, the sledge type, those pieces dont want to 
come out without a fight!!!! Haynes manual is very helpful.

3. exhaust without cats are very loud and dont sound very good. not to mention 
there is a possibility that there is not enough backpressure.  the engine is 
set to run with a certain amount and once you get to low the effects are not 
positive.  A test pipe is a much better way of doing things but i had a very 
hard time finding a shop that would put it on.  Federal law states that a cat 
can only be removed if it is being replaced with a new one, so places like 
midas, etc. are out of the question. some shops wont even switch them unless the 
old one is broken, my friend had to put a hole in his to have it changed, and 
even then they didnt want to.

4.  does anyone have the workshop manual that would be willing to photocopy the 
part about replacing the power steering rack?  the haynes manual is useless for 
it and i cant find anyone locally that is a fan like we are.

thanks,

matt
