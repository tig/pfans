Eric, I had a similar problem on my 951S. My gauge reads .8 bar at rest
and goes to 1.5 bar at max boost. I took it into the dealer and had it
checked with their factory calibrated boost gauge. It turned out that my
gauge doesn't read accurately (not uncommon from what I've been told)
and everything was working fine. A more objective test is to check out
your acceleration times. I use 60 -100 mph in 3rd gear (8.5 secs on my
car). I'm not sure what an 86 951 will do but I'm sure someone on the
list can tell you.
