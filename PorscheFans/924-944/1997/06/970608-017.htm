I have a remote radar detector and I just installed the main part of it in
the spoiler. The laser detector is mounted in the center of the windshield
above the mirror and the display is mounted at the bottom of the dash by my
right knee. All-in-all it's invisible from the outside and I've had a couple
of policemen let me go with warnings after they glanced around my windshield,
I assume they were looking for a detector or suction cup marks.
