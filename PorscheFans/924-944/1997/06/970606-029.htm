TO: Porsche Boy
FR: Rick (87 924S)

I hate to rain you buddy's parade, but I think he's going to be REAL
hard pressed to find any 911's for sale for around $5K - $6K that runs
and hasn't been rolled that's a 1980's vintage or later.  Trust me, I've
been looking for years and I don't think there is such an animal.  

Now if he's thinking 914, 924, 924S, 944, 944S he has a good chance of
finding himself a nice toy.  Of course, you get what you pay for
sometimes.  But..there are some real bargains out there.  My Dad bought
a 1987  924S down in Florida from an older woman that wanted something
more sedate and only paid $4500 for it.  The car was pristine and only
had 32,000 miles on it.  TRUE STORY!  I know, because I bought her from
Dad.  So shop around.  Sometimes the best places to look are in your
regional (or national) "Wheeler Dealer" monthly's.  You know the ones
with pages and pages of the business card size photo adds.  There are
some real deals in there, but before he buys check out the car
thoroughly.  There's a porsche FAQ page somewhere that tells you what to
look for on used porsches, though I can't remember the address.  Maybe
one of the other guys can help you on that one.  Best of Luck, Rick
.
