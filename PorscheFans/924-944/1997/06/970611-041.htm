Hi everyone,

I just changed my transmission fluid to Swepco 201 gear oil (thanks
to Michael Belfoure for making the procedure sound so easy; it was!).
The main reason I contemplated the change was to quiet down the noise
in the driveline. Mission accomplished! At idle, the "rattling" has
completely disappeared, and at launch only a hint of noise remains.
That said, I'm afraid that shifting into 2nd gear hasn't improved at
all. At first I thought it may have gotten even worse, but it was
just in my head. My hopes were a little too high I guess. Anyway, it
was worth my $34.50 just to shut the damn thing up! I'm desperately
hoping the oil will "work" its way in over the next week or so, and
all my shifter woes will go away. Please, no one crush my dreams!

I'll now prepare myself for the barrage of posts telling me that
this oil is not compatible with my transaxle, and that I'm a big,
stupid, dummyhead for putting it in there. Even if I am, I'm much
cooler now because I don't rattle at stoplights!
