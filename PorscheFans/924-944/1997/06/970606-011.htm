Subject:  Steam Clean Engine

Hello Porsche Fans,

My in-laws bought a used car the other day and the engine looked brand
new!  I couldn't believe it!  I started to get the bug to get my '87 944 engine
looking brand new.  So, I made a few phone calls yesterday to a couple
of detailing shops and gathered some info.  All it did was made me a little
wary about doing anything with the engine.

Some detailing shops said that they don't use steam because the high
temperatures tend to affect the electronics so they use pressure
cleaning (pressure cleaning seems just a little to harsh to me).  Some
detailing shops said that they use steam very successfully and does a
better job than pressure.  So I said TIME OUT!! I'll convey the info to the
LIST and find out what you guys/gals have to say.

Has anybody steamed/pressure cleaned there engine?  What kind of
results did you get?  Is there another way of getting the engine to that
brand new (or close to it) look?  

Any inputs would be much appreciated!



Thanks
Karl
