Well, George, it may not be a good way to do it.

Hydraulic brakes are dependant on the relation of diameters on the
actuating cylinder (master) vs the working cylinders (calipers). On any
given brake system, these relations are balanced for pedal travel (to
get sufficient travel reserve) , pedal force (to be physically able to
brake) and the balance between forward and rear brakes (to counter
weight transfer). The servo is a essential part of this system as is the
choosen diameters of the hydraulic cylinders. Sometimes, regulating
valves are incorporated to further differentiate between aft and forward
pressure balance.  

If you want to get rid of the servo, you have to go to a smaller, not
bigger, master cylinder, to be able to excert the same force on the disc
(which is what actually brakes the car)

A real life (death?) test could be easily made, just by letting the car
roll downhill with a turned off engine. Make sure the brake booster is
'emptied' before you start thhe descent, (filled, actually, it is a low
pressure/vacuum device) and see what you like the tour...

But, basically, my advice is 'don't mess with brakes'. This may the sole
reason for list members to not answer your post...
