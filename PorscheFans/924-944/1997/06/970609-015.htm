Does this count as police harassment?

OK the following events all happened within 48 hours in a town call Brighton on 
the south coast of UK, to the same guy (Me!), in the same car (1982 931).

Incident 1
While coming back from my night job (Door Security at a local night club) about
3:00am in the morning I made my first mistake. Eager to get home I took off
from 
a set of traffic lights a bit too quick. A few meters later there was a
flashing 
blue light in my mirror. Having been informed that Brighton wasn't my own
personal
race track (Fair comment) I was given what is known over here as a 7 day
wonder. 
(You have 7 days to produce all documents for your car to the local police
station)
No fine, No points on my licence, No problem.

Incident 2
Deciding I would clear my good name ASAP the next day about 6:00pm I headed down
to the local police station documents in hand. Yep there all in order sir. Great
I thought heading back home problem sorted. about 10 mins from home there it was
again, a blue flashing light in my mirror. Just a routine check Sir. Fine
here are
all the documents officer. OH they all seem to be in order sir, thanks for
stopping.

Incident 3
Time about 11:45pm, Ive picked up my girlfriend from her bar work and have
taken her
home. Dropping her off outside her house while I go looking for a place to park.
 200 meters down the road theres this large police office running along side
my car
(you can tell how fast I was going) Pull Over! Great what have I done this time?
Do you live around here Sir, No but my girlfriend does. This your car sir? Yes!
Bet it goes some eh? Wouldn't know office I never go above 70 :) Mind if we have
a look round sir, Just a routine check. At which point they proceed to
search my 
car! This is where things start going wrong. I had bought the car off a farmer
about 2 months earlier and in their search the found an old shotgun cartridge. 
PANIC! within minutes the Armed Response Unit turned up, I was searched
under the
prevention of Terrorism act. the car was Search even more. After half an hour of
being questioned in the back of a police car (e.g. what are you doing
cruising the
streets of Brighton at 12:00 with live ammunition) I was told I was free to
go, a
report of the incident would be forwarded to me. Thanks for Stopping!

Incident  4
Waking up the next day, to find what looked like a police car parked out
side, This
turned out to be a traffic warden. and the guy in trouble was me again!
Parked 3ft
to close to a junction. Other people had parked even closer, but only my car was
scheduled to be towed. Fine I thought 20 pound fine, which I could argue,
and Ill
move my car so it won't be towed. Got in, started it up, and moved it 30 meters
down the road and parked again. Getting out of the car I was confronted by a
large
police office. Good morning sir, I wonder if you would mind breathing into this
for my. After a good examination of the car (tires lights etc.) I was
thanked for
my co-operation.

One thing about the English Police force, They are at all time polite and
courteous,
just a little vindictive sometimes. My only crime possession of a fast car
and long
hair.


P.S. Has anyone got any ideas about a Intercooler for the 931, I don't want to
fork out the fortune Porsche want for a 924C version. Does any one else make
one?
