Did some more testing to try to resolve my low boost problem
('86 951, 84k miles, Autothority chips) per Len Sigal's note of 6/24:

 - Compressor bypass valve holds pressure - OK.
 - Am getting full throttle.
 - Wastegate not leaking (WG outlet pipe cold).
 - Checked all air hoses, pipes, intercooler, intake manifold for
    leaks - OK. 
 - No exhaust leaks.
 - Hooked up a calibrated boost gage and compared to dash gage - 

With the original banjo bolt in the turbo-to-intercooler pipe,
max. boost attainable is 7.5 psi (0.5 bar). This is in third gear at 
about 4500 rpm (traffic-limited)  - first and second gears are about
1 psi lower.  Boost rolls off about 1 psi above 5500.
  
With hose to wastegate fully pinched off, max. attainable boost is
about 12-13 psi (0.8 bar), again in third at about 4500.  Boost in first
and second gears: about 11 psi.  Boost does not roll off above 5500 
(since KLR box can't control boost with line pinched off).  Can get
0.8 bar as low as 3750 rpm, but it stays there until redline - won't
go any higher.

I'm suspecting one of two things:

1. Turbo is bad and somehow will not make more than 0.8 bar boost,
2. Catalytic converter is plugged, restricting exhaust flow out of turbo
    to a given level (in this case 0.8 bar).

I notice that when I park the car at night after a hard drive and open the
hood, the exhaust manifolds are glowing orange (!) in the noninsulated 
areas of the primary pipes near the head flanges and at the 3-bolt flanges
connecting the manifolds to the crossover pipe.  Is this normal for a 951?
I realize that it uses ceramic exhaust port liners and insulated pipes to
keep exhaust gas velocity/temperature up for the turbo way over on the
intake side of the engine, but orange seems a bit hot.  If this is not normal,
it would point to a clogged catalyst, wouldn't it?

TIA, Eric
