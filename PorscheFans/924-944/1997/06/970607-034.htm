Hi all, 

My 83 944 has an unusual (to me) start problem. When I park it in direct 
sunlight for around 1 or more hours, it wont start. It cranks fine but acts as if 
it's getting no spark.  Usually after waiting anywhere from 10-30 minutes, it 
will start. I dont believe this is engine heat related as it will start everytime 
immediatly after running.  When its parked in the shade or my garage, it 
starts fine.

Ive replaced the coil, wires, and plugs. Will replace the rotor & cap as soon 
as I re-coop from paying for those dang wires!

This was the case up until two days ago. It seems to be getting worse. Now 
Its having trouble starting after it has been recently turned off and usually 
takes a couple trys to get started every time I get in it.

Any ideas? This is driving me nuts.
