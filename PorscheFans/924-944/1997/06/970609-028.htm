How difficult is changing the motor mounts on my 86 944NA?

Not real hard.
 Is this something I can do myself, or should I hire it out?

Depends on what your basic skill levels are for mechanical work.
 Are there 2 or 4 of them?

There are 2.
 How am I sure that they are bad?

If you look at them, quite easily seen behind the wheel wells, if they look 
flat they are shot. Usually the Right one goes 1st due to heat of pipes, 
but it can be the other one or both.
 I get a good deal of vibration, especially at idle and start-up in 1st 
gear.

The book calls for putting the car in neutral and turning on the AC, if 
they are shot the vibration goes up fast.

My trick is to replace them both at the same time. Jack up the car and put 
the rails on blocks along with blocks under Bell housing and front of motor 
(Some put a 4x4 across the shock towers and chain the motor to it). Then 
put jacks under the cross member and unbolt the motor mounts from cross 
member and lower the cross member a bit.

Now you can unbolt the mounts and replace them. Raise the cross member to 
the mounts and bolt them in. lower car and remove supports and your done.

Your welcome
