 I've been lurking on the list for several weeks now as I consider the
 purchase of a 944 to replace my current car.  I was wondering if anyone
 would like to offer their take on using the 944 as a daily driver, what
 are the costs involved, and how does it compare (power/performance wise)
 to a 2nd generation RX-7?
 
 Steve,
 
 When I bought my first 944, I had initially intended to buy a 2nd
 generation RX-7.  I drove a few of the Mazdas including one low mileage
 example that was flawless.  All were nice cars and fun to drive, but
 they were not very robust and most of the controls felt rubbery.  I then
 drove a beat up 944 and knew that this was the model (but NOT the car)
 for me.  Unlike the RX-7, I had a very connected feel to the vehicle --
 I really was part of the driving experience.  I then drove a gorgeous
 '86 944 NA with 100,000 miles that just blew me away.  It was the
 tightest car I had ever driven and it was incredibly responsive.  It was
 as if the car didn't realize it had covered so many miles in its life.

I'm in almost exactly the same situation as the original poster ( I have a
rabbit GTI that I was going to reserve as a winter car and store during
summers but maybe I have room for two) I was hoping you could elaborate on
this lack of feeling of connectedness in the rx7. I am a big fan of german
engineering but for the difference in price I am forcing myself to consider
the seven. Could someone please convince me ( with facts) that the 944 is by
far the better car and that I shouldn't even consider the seven. This
shouldn't be so hard anyway as I am a sucker for those beautiful fenders.
TIA,
Oliver Hoen
