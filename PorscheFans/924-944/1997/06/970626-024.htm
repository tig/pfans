Buy a flywheel lock, costs about $40. Remove the starter, bolt the flywheel 
lock on. You can then apply the 300 -> 800 ft-lbs it will take to remove the 
bolt. Haynes suggests use a screwdriver or punch in place of the flywheel 
lock, RESIST the TEMPTATION, buy the flywheel lock! When you remove the 
crankshaft bolt, make sure you use a good quality socket, and LOOOOONG breaker 
bar. I removed the oil pump to remove the seal. However, this is not what I 
recommend because you have to lower the oil pan, clean the oil pump surfaces, 
and reinstall with Loctite 574. Not much fun....
 You could use a screwdriver, but I would recommend a seal puller made 
specifically for the job. I have never used one, so perhaps others can give 
you advice on that.
Good Luck!
