Oh yeah, is anyone else besides me tired of the people who think that they
are cool by passing a Porsche? I get tired of it, cause I don't speed much,
but people go out of their way to pass me (plus I get attitude, cause I'm
only 17 and all these old guys in lame cars are jealous). I once had a guy
in a new pontiac SE floor it just to pass me, because I had left the last
couple of lights ahead of him (I wasn't even paying attention to him). Whats
the point? Do these people somehow feel satsifaction by passing a car that
is obeying the legal speed limits (Hey, If I get a ticket I'm screwed)? Just
a thought...


Shawn,

Get used to it buddy!  I don't know where you live, but down here in the
southeast where I live I am inundated with this on a daily basis.  I live
right smack dab in the middle of NASCAR country where "Fords, Pontiacs, and
Chevrolets rule!"  Yeah, right! (very sarcastic here).  The worst are those
Z28 Cameros, Mustang GT's, and those new "wide body" Pontiacs.  C'mmon, give
me a break - it took Pontiac 20 years to figure out "wider is better"?!  Duh!
And how about the new '97 vette?  Where the designers admit to having sneaked
a peek at the Porsche 944/968 cars and attempting to copy the rear transmission
design.  BTW, the vettes have already had a major factory recall despite having
only been out a very short time.  I even had a really souped up Dodge Neon blow
by me once - this guy thought he was a real bad a** showing off to his girl
friend.  If these NASCAR boys think they are the greatest in the world, then
how come they won't race against stock Porsches on the racetrack?  I mean it is
supposed to be "stock" car racing right?  One of the local Porsche dealers
has had a major vandalism problem whenever there is a major NASCAR race in
town - over the weekend, a couple of times, all his 911's have been keyed
BADLY - some even looked like they had been kicked in the door - you could
see the minor dents and scuff marks.

Don't let it get to you - just let them pass you.  It's not worth risking
life, limb, and personal property for these "road duals".  Down here, if you
are caught in such a "race" your car is immediately siezed and later sold at an
auction while you sit in jail.

Off the subject a little, it's a real shame that F1, F2, F3 Grand Prix racing
is not as popular in the USA as it is in, well, just about every other
industrialized country on this planet.  I never even heard of NASCAR until I
came to the USA and people in the UK I know still have no clue as to what is
so great about NASCAR - but the NASCAR boys say they are the best in the world.
Who's world?  They are legends in their own minds!

Sorry for wasting BW here on non-technical stuff.  I hope there aren't any
PorscheFans who are secretly NASCAR fans on this mailist and were offended
by my comments.  If so, then let's settle this man to man, on the track - you
in your "stock" NASCAR and me in my stock 951.
