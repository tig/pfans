Michael,

I have had direct experience with both.  I have had both the A509 and
the AVS Intermediate (the best handler for the $) and the RE930.  The
930 has good traction as the Tire Rack will tell you, but I think the
HANDLING sucks.  Real wishy-washy in the tail in slalom manuvers.  I
sent them back under Bridgestone's ride guarantee and TR paid one way's
freight.  You do need to find a place to mount them.  Found a returned
set of AVS A+4's cheap.  Much better feel, though lower limits than the
A509 or AVS Int.  I have found that Yokohama is one to place good
handling response as a priority in design (I can't tell between .8 and
..815g, but I know where the end is ;-) ).

>>>I have pretty much narrowed it down to Yokohama or Bridgestone.  Does
anyone have any experience with the Yoko A509 or the Bridge RE930?
Also, any thought/comments on doing business with one of those mail
order tire places (that advertise in Road & Track)?  The prices are good
but it seems like quite a hassle if you had to return a defective tire.
