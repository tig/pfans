Another good reason to buy the lifetime balancing package whenever
possible.

Sorry, I should stop lurking on this one: I used to work in a tire shop
that dealt with a lot of high-performance cars, including Porches,
Mercedes, Jags, Acura (NSX), etc.

Any of the previously mentioned things can cause wheels to vibrate as
described, from a wheel weight spun off a rim or out-of-round tire to
bad balljoints or other suspension components. Vibration experienced
only at 60-65 mph is the trademark of out-of-balance wheels/tires, if
experienced at much lower speeds think of things like separated belts,
out of round tires, etc. (but this is only a general rule, not a
guarantee).

There are a number of different ways a shop can balance a wheel using
the same machine, including putting the weights only on the inside.
Naturally, this will give you a poorer balance than having weights on
both sides of the rim. As previously mentioned, they shop should always
re-spin the wheel to check for 0 oz. out of balance after adding
weights. Also make sure there's only one weight on each side of the
wheel, unless they're using stick-on weights. It's also possible to
balance the tires to the nearest 0.10 ounce instead of to the nearest
0.25 ounce. This is not done as often since the weights usually come in
0.25 oz. increments, and it's more time-consuming. 

The moral of the story is to raise hell with the shop manager until
you're satisfied with the job his workers have done.

Hope this helps...
