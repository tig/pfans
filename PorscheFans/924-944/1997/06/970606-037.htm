I drove down to Atlanta for COMDEX in our AudiV8Quattro, since I was
forced to sell the 944turbo last week (someone offered me WAY too much money
for it)

It was somewhere around Charlotte that I realized that if I had an
unlimited gas card and the CD Club would deliver to rest stops, I might
never have to work again.

It's been a while since I took a LONG drive in a REAL car.  Cruising
Atlanta's loop (6 lanes each direction) late at night with the windows
down and the CD changer pumping VERY loud was most enjoyable.

Just a random comment.  I think the V8 quattro is about as close as you
can get to a 4-door Porsche.  Then again, I'm not exactly impartial!

Guess that's why I drove 800 miles each way even though I could have flown
at UD expense.
