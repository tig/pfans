I?l try again, my computer is a b|gdator!
Sometimes on our list we ask each other wether a Volkswagen part fits 
to a Porsche. A good way to find out if Porsche has borrowed something 
from a Volkswagen or a Audi is to look at the part number.

The part number is read like this: 944 347 011 AF
=Steering rack for a 944

The first three numbers (944) is the car model
The fourth (3) is the main group
The fifth and sixth (47) is the under group
The last three (011) is just a number in a row, but if you are looking 
for body panels and trim the seventh number tells you if it is on the 
right side (even numbers) or left side (odd numbers).
The last letter(s) is the change letter on the article.


On the old air cooled Volkswagens this was the rule in the main group 
(3):
1=Engine 
2=Exhaust/heating (Works together on a VW beetle)
3=Gearbox
4=Steering components and front suspension
5=Rear suspension 
6=Brakes/wheels
7=Chassis
8=Body panels and trim
9=Electrics

As you can see above the steering rack would be a part in the gearbox! 
I believe Porsche has some rules too but they doesn?t seem to be the 
same. Anyone?

When I was rebuilding my 924 for racing, i always looked at the first 
three numbers,
111,113=beetle
211=VW Bus
311= Notch back
171, 191=rabbit
So if the part number started with any of these i could afford to buy a 
new one, but if it started with 477 or 911 or 944 or 928 i had to clean 
it up and use it again.
