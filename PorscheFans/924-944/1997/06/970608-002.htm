The model Audi I think you are referring to is the Audi RS2 Avante. It
is based on the four wheel drive 5 cylinder turbo Audi 80 Avante.
Porsche didn't so much tweek as re-engineer this car. It jumped from
~220hp to ~330hp with a similar increase in torque. It had a six speed
box, full time four wheel drive, tricky suspension and wait for it,
brakes from a 911 3.6 turbo. The "Big Red" calipers had Porsche on them
just like our cars do. It didn't end there either, 17' "cup" wheels with
Audi center caps. Full leather Recaro interior, available in black .
White faced gauges, 170mph top end speed etc etc. Sound like something
you want to own right? If Porsche made station wagons this is the wagon
they would build. Here in Auckland there are about 10 rolling around. 2
of those are sitting on car lots, both blk/blk, low miles, both NZ$
140,000, both right hand drive, sorry guys. Oh yeah, an English magazine
did 0-100 test. They found the RS2 was the fasted production car in the
world to get to 30mph, faster than Lambo's 930's Maclaren F1's etc. The
time was in the low 1 sec bracket with ALL FOUR WHEELS SMOKING!!.

PS On the badge it reads "RS2" and below "by Porsche" in smaller type.

Porsche did tweak a particular, limited-edition, Audi station-wagon a
few
years ago for the European market.  0-60 in 4.6 seconds...
