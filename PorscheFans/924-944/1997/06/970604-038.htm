Eric, 

If you have the same vibration that I am still experiencing, it is not
the clutch. I experience a vibration centred at about 3050 rpm in the
shift lever and clutch pedal when engaged. The vibration is also
experienced when the clutch is disengaged and the car is stopped (@ 3050
rpm). This vibration was lessened only a little when I replaced the
clutch. The motor mounts were replaced and the transmission had syncros
replaced. This vibration was not present in my former 944na. My dealer
and the service rep for Porsche Canada were not able to find the source.
The rep felt that it was exhaust related (I had just installed a test
pipe). The only thing that I can figure is an out-of-centre flywheel
even though it was turned.

I don't know if this helps but I would love to solve this problem.
