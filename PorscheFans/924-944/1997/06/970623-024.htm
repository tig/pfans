I believe the shocks are dying on the rear of my '86 944 with 231,000 miles. 
Why do I think this? When I push down on the front of the vehicle, it feels 
stiff, and there is absolutely no bounce, it feels slightly overdamped. The 
front shocks are yellow adj. konis. When I push down on the rear of the 
vehicle, it bounces a bit, ie. is under-damped, and just does not feel right 
on the road. The rear shocks are also yellow adjustable konis. In addition, 
the rear of the vehicle feels like it has softer springs.

What is the stock spring rate for the FRONT? For the REAR?

What is the stock ride height?

I recently had it aligned and leveled. They did not re-index the rear torsion 
bars, but did let it down a little with the spring plates. This would 
obviously reduce the torsion on the bars, making it feel softer. In addition, 
could the torsion bars be worn? I do not know if the front springs are stock 
either. To me, it feels like the rear is much softer than the front.

Anyone have a good used set of yellow adj. konis for the rear of a 944 that 
they are willing to sell me at a low price?

As always, any and all advice is much appreciated.

Thanks,
       Ezra
