Hello All,
	I just had a strange encounter with my electrical system, and need some
advice. Here's the story: I left my '86 944 parked over the weekend, and
when I tried to start it, it cranked and cranked, but wouldn't fire. It
finally started to drain the battery, so I called in a towing service
(one that trailers, naturally). When the tow-truck showed up, the driver
popped the hood, pulled the coil wire off the distributor cap, put it
half-way back on, and the car fired right up.
According to the driver, this is a fairly well know problem with the
944, and involves the coil sending too much current to the cap. He said
that to get it really fixed I should replace a) the cap and b) the coil
pack, in that order. My question is, has anyone else ever had this
problem, and does the recommended course of action sound correct? In the
meantime, I'm driving around town with my coil wire half off, and the
car drives fine.
