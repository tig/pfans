Before you take it in and hand over a blank check to the dealer, check
all of the vaccum hoses. Especially the one that comes from the
wastegate and leads to your amal valve on the intake manifold. I suspect
that this one is pluged. While your there you may want to put a valve on
this hose so you can raise yor boost.
