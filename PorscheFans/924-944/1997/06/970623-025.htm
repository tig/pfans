Hi all,
	I have a ?? about performance chips.  I recently purchased an 88 944 
Turbo.  I specifically asked the previous owner if he had chipped the car and he 
said no.  However, in the glove box of the car was a bag containing some bulbs and 

fuses and WHAT IS THIS, a box with a chipset in it.  Also, the label on the bag 
says

AUTOTHORITY PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING
PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE FOR PORSCHE
PART NUMBER:  951.020.200.20
APPLICATION: 944t '86/7 STAGE 2

So, my ?? is....are the chips in this bag the performance chips or are the 
performance chips in the car and these are the OEM.

There are 2 24pin DIP packages.  They have a printed number on them as well as a 
handwritten note.

One says DME with number 1267355235
One says KLR with number 1267355138

The numbers are somewhat difficult to read so one or more digits may be wrong.  
Can anyone help identify these chips?

At a minimum, does anybody know the webpage or phone number for Autothority so I 
could call and ask them?
