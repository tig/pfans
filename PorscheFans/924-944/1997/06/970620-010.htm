The high technology is a big part of the problem for F1. Everything is
so expensive that there are only a few teams with the resources to win.
Remove Ferrari and Williams, and who stands a chance? In NASCAR, since
everyone is on equal footing (more or less) the cost of a competitive
car is about 100K, there are lots of competitive teams. You never
know who is going to win until the race is over.

F1 is the premier motorsport category in the world to compare its long
proud history that dates back to the very first Grand Prix at Le Mans
with knuckle dragging NASCAR races amazes me. I imagine we would not be
debating this if Porsche still had a F1 interest.
