  The following is a bit long. It is a personal story, read only if you like 
never-ending paragraphs which jump from past to present tense, and then back 
again, and truly like to be bored.

   This weekend, my wife and I attended a wedding in Manchester NH, which is 
about 2.5 hours away from home. Friday was a perfect sunny day here in the 
northeast, perfect for a nice drive. We left early so we could make it to the 
rehearsal, my wife was one of the bridesmaids. The trip down was uneventful, 
spent most of the drive following this dry cleaning van from Mass. doing about 
90. Of course, if a cop had been around, we would have been pulled over, not 
the van. Funny thing how they would stop the red porsche, not the white van 
with bad shocks going way to fast for its limits....
  We spent Friday night at the inlaws. I parked in their driveway. Saturday 
morning at about 8:00am, my wife wakes me up to get the green bow she had to 
wear at the wedding, and had left in the car the previous night. I drag myself 
downstairs. I think the birds in NH have been studying that Nissan commercial 
because about 5 of them had done their duty on the hood. Ok, so I back the car 
out of the driveway and pull it into the driveway on the other side of the 
house where the hose is. Pulling up the driveway, the rear valance lightly 
scrapes the driveway, Damn...  I wash the car, no damage to the paint, I think 
maybe the rest of the day will go better. I bring the ugly green bow upstairs, 
eat a quick breakfast,take a shower, etc... At about 9:00am, my wife's Aunt 
and uncle arrive. My wife is going with her uncle to meet the rest of the 
wedding party, her aunt is to ride with me in the 944, she wants to arrive in 
style. They leave. It is about 9:30 AM, and the wedding doesn't start until 
11:00am, plenty of time to goto the auto parts store and look for AC parts!  I 
get my father inlaw to back his car out of the driveway (he had just pulled in 
moments ago). He backs out, and waits in the street as I pull slowly out of 
the driveway. I turn the wheel all the way to place the car at an angle on the 
steep incline at the bottom of the driveway, I didn't want to scrape the rear 
valance again. The steering hits the stop, and I hear a POP, the engine has 
this strange vibration to it, and I no longer have power steering! I quickly 
come to a stop in the road, and pop the hood. I look down, and see that the 
power steering pulley on the crankshaft has come loose, and is wobbling. I 
dive through the driver's side window, and shut the engine off.  I reached 
under the front valance (I had left the engine shield off when I changed the 
seals, belts, etc. this spring) and found that the crankshaft bolt was about 
halfway out. My father in law helps me push the vehicle next to the curb. I 
borrow his keys, and drive to the nearest auto parts store, VIP. They only 
have sockets going up to 15mm, but I pick up a $24 torque wrench. I speed over 
to Sears (driving much faster than Oldsmobile intended), and pick up a couple 
of extensions, and the much needed 24mm socket. I arrive back at the inlaws at 
~10:40am just in time to see my mother and Aunt inlaw take off with the 
neighbor, getting a ride to the wedding. My father inlaw sticks around to 
watch me. Lying on the ground, I remove the crankshaft bolt, there are slight 
traces of oil on it. Ok, so I didn't do a very good job cleaning it off before 
I installed it last time. I wipe it off, and apply some medium strength 
loctite. I jacked up the right hand side of the vehicle, placed some bricks in 
front of the rear wheels, placed the trany in 5th, and wrestled with the 
torque wrench attempting to get 152 ft-lbs out of it with almost no leverage. 
With the vehicle on the verge of falling on me with every heave, I finally 
throw towel in at 11:00am, and call it close enough. I toss the tools in the 
trunk, and hastily clean up. I arrived at the wedding only 15 minutes late. I 
think my father inlaw was giving me funny looks when I proceeded to place the 
sunshield on. Hey I have my priorities! At least we made it before the vows..

  Well, if you read this far, you must be truly bored, I know I was when I 
re-read it....

So what did I learn from this? That crankshaft bolt is the devil. It took 
about 800 ft-lbs to remove, and will always be a pain in the ass. But hey, it 
was a good excuse for my forgetting to wear my tie, I hate those things!

Later,
     Ezra, really really happy I didn't bend any valves!
