The wiring diagram says G8 is a buzzer relay, but my fuse cover says its
for S.A. only (South America?). G8 is a free spot in my car too.

Hi Greg you are correct about the labeling. But if you check the wiring
diagram it's also called the "high beam relay". If you check your cover
again you should notice that nowhere is one of the relays labeled for the
high beams, I guess it's "complementary" to use it. BTW my cover says G18,
(which is plugged in) is a "fog lamp cutoff (Japan only)" so I guess I got
a bonus relay even though my car is an american model. Earlier years, G18
was the sunroof relay but later changed to G20 (on my 1991 at least).
