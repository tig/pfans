Hello p-fans: the trip from Seattle, WA to Denver, CO was uneventful 
and comfortable in my 944. Unfortunately something is amiss in the 
belt region, there is a semi-loud clunk that I suspect is a premature 
balance shaft roller failure (less than 4000 miles on them) but really 
could be anything in that area. I am disappointed with service at 
Chris's German Auto in Bellevue, WA. I got the distinct feeling they 
are so swamped with 993s and 911s that fitting in routine maintenance 
of an ancient 944 was a huge favor. In any case when I sent the car in 
just before this trip for the 3000 mile belt re-tension and fuel 
mixture adjustment, they gave my 944 a clean bill of health. 500 miles 
into the trip I ran out of gas, and noticed I was getting 18 miles/gal 
@ 75mph! Called Chris and got some instructions over the phone for 
adjusting the AFM and since then fuel consumption is ok, but there is 
a noticeable low-RPM hesitation that is probably mixture-related, and 
then this clunking noise started. The car will be at Pat Moyle's shop 
in a few weeks so I guess I'll know if Chris did his job and I will 
let the list know.

If there are any early 944 owners in the Denver/Boulder area 
interested in helping me diagnose my car's noises and hesitation, 
please drop me a line.
