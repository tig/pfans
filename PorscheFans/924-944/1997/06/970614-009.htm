I have an 85.5 944 and just recently purchased the 944 turbo-style nose
conversion for it (its the turbo nose, but it is designed to fit the
non-turbo flares). I am planning on installing the nose myself, as I prefer
to avoid the $200-400 cost of having a professional body shop install it.
I'm wondering if there are any suggestions or tips on how to install it. 

Oh yeah, is anyone else besides me tired of the people who think that they
are cool by passing a Porsche? I get tired of it, cause I don't speed much,
but people go out of their way to pass me (plus I get attitude, cause I'm
only 17 and all these old guys in lame cars are jealous). I once had a guy
in a new pontiac SE floor it just to pass me, because I had left the last
couple of lights ahead of him (I wasn't even paying attention to him). Whats
the point? Do these people somehow feel satsifaction by passing a car that
is obeying the legal speed limits (Hey, If I get a ticket I'm screwed)? Just
a thought...
