Paul Weston is a great guy! He has been around PCA for the last 13 years I 
have been there. He was one of my 1st instructors and really knows what he 
is doing. He started selling Cool Carbon Pads when the ideal all of us were 
running Forado DS-11 pads.

When Cool carbon went under he contracted directly with the manufacture to 
produce the best of their line under his own name AFT. I have used his 
stuff on by race 914 and am very happy. Can't say enough about his and his 
stand behind the product way of working. If you don't like it tell him and 
he will make you whole.

   Has anyone used Advanced Friction Technologies (AFT)
   Carbon-Kevlar racing pads available from Weston
   Motorsports as advertised in Panorama?  These are
   manufactured by KYRR Friction Products of
   Canton, OH. The 03 compound has a .46 Coefficient of
   Friction.

   Any first hand experience as to stopping power, pad
   wear rate, rotor wear rate, noise/squeal, dust, brake
   fade, heat transfer to caliper?

   How do you tell if a pad has a ceramic backed
   insulator?

   Regards,
   Jim
