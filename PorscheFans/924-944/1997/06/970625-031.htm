Mark,
"JB Weld" epoxy works very well for metal gas tank repairs. You can also 
purchase various epoxy putties made specifically for gas tank repairs. If the 
space between the tank and the trunk is not too large, you may be able to 
squish such an epoxy putty through the hole you drilled. You should be able to 
seal the hole in the tank that way, but I would still be concerned that 
corrosion may occur inside the tank on the edges of the hole as water 
condenses on it. If you really want to protect against that, you will need to 
remove the tank, fuel pump, lines, etc. and use one of those gas tank coating 
kits. If your tank is plastic, I do not know what your options are. Perhaps 
you could screw in a larger self tapping screw to plug the hole?
Good Luck!
          Ezra
