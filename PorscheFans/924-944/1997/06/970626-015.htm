Well, 2000 mostly highway miles later, the hatch is fine, with no
problems related to re-gluing the hatch. I still have to adjust the
latch post to get a tight seal and replace one of the lift cylinders. I
found that the reason my frame was bent was because the lift cylinders
were of different strengths!

The straightening process is just a matter of bending the frame in
whatever way is appropriate for you. If you have any experience at
bending body sheetmetal it'll help you here. The best way is to support
the frame on a workbench, preferably in a padded vice, and band away
with a body hammer, preferably with a soft face (since the frame is
aluminum). 

Don't try to flatten the metal between the hammer and a flat surface;
rather, gently "caress" the metal into shape by placing the dolly or
other flat hard surface _next_ to the high spot on one side, the hammer
on the high spot to lower it. Then repeat for the other side to obtain
smoothness. This is the same way you straighten a body panel.

        ___________/   \__________      Smooth the panel/frame out
                        OOOO

Hope this helps.
