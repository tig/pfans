Cheap is a relative term...get the parts that do the job right the first time,
even if they are more expensive, and you will save in the long run. 
Automotion is a good source for parts, as well as Automobile Atlanta.

>My odometer doesn't work.  The speedometer does.  Is this a common

> Any ideas?

If I remember correctly, a great repair shop is North Hollywood
Speedometer (or something like that).  I can research that and send you
info off-line, if you prefer.

>The gas gauge jumps.  When it does, it is off about a quarter tank. 
>What is up with this?

This sounds like a common 924 problem - poor electrical grounding.  It
may also affect your temp gauge.  People at Automotion or Automobile
Atlanta should have ground upgrading kits that will improve this situation.

>The filter sucks air through a small hole.  Should I modify the "air
>restrictor" in any way such as cutting it off?

NO!  The air intake was designed to take in cool, outside air from the
fender inlet area.  If you cut it off, you will take in hot, under hood air and
reduce your performance.

I would personally stay away from fiberglass, as it is non-original and
that sounds too cheap to really address the rust issue.  A professional
body shop estimate of the extent of the problem is a good start point. 
One other idea to check is if you have a plugged drain tube for the A/C. 
If so, the drain tray will overflow into the passenger footwell.

The motors are not cheap, but since you have no glass right now, you
should be able to check the function of the motor.  To the best of my
knowledge, the mounting for the mirror glass should center itself in the
housing.

>Is there a place that I can get the little plastic seals that go around the

>not very helpful....

Automotion will have the seals, as should any competent dealer...

>The seal around the area where the sunroof sits looks pretty generic. 
>Can it be bough as a non Porsche part at a reasonable price?  Where
>might I find it.

Not a generic part.  I don't remember exactly, but the cost from the dealer
is <$100.
 
>My front wheels seem wobly.  It seems to be that the struts woble,
>although they seem to compress correctly.  Will replacing them give me
>much better handling?  Are they hard to replace?

Wobble could be from bad wheel bearings.  Replacing struts with Konis
or equivalent will improve handling.  Remember, suspension components
are linked, so improving one area may lead you to upgrading other areas.

>Are there any ways to really boost the performance inexpensivly?  I
>just passed emmisions, so I can get away with quite a bit for a while.  I
>already have racing headers.

In my experience, without spending dramatic sums of money, it is difficult
to improve the performance of the 924 in a really measurable manner.  It
is a good all around car, but is down on horsepower.

>I have heard something about being able to put disk breaks from a super
>beattle onto the back of the 924.  Is this possible?  Is it easy?

No experience with VW conversions, but Porsche did make versions of
the 924 with 4wheel disc brakes.  This would be the preferred
conversion.

>Do 924s come stock with anti-sway bars?  If not, are they a
>worth-while upgrade?

If memory serves me correctly, they came with a front bar, but not rear. 
As to upgrading, it depends on your objective.  You can sink a lot of
money into the car and make it do almost anything you want, or you
could sell, and invest the proceeds and the projected upgrade cost into a
good used 944 :)  Based on my experience, this would be the preferred
path to improved performance.

If the car doesn't seem right, pass on it... there are plenty of others
available.  See above comment regarding upgrade paths.

>Anything else I should know about with these cars?

Most worthwhile is membership in Porsche Club of America.  PCA gives
you access to a lot of great resources, can get you discounts on parts
and another support group and activities for you and your trusty mount.
