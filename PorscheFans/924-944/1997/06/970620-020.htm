<snip> cheap looking interiors

I'm not sure if I posted this to the group before or not but here goes
again.  My brother-in-law has a Ferrari 308 GTSi that he club races.  I got
to drive the car a while back and was floored by the acceleration and
handling.  But, the interior really looked cheesy.  I mentioned this to him
and his comment was that in Ferrari circles it is said that you buy the
driveline and chassis and get the rest for free!  Always thought that was
funny!

btw, the 911 has always been my dreams car and I still plan to own one in
the future. But if a snobby 911 person comments that I don't own a real
Porsche, I might just have to pull an AJ Foyt on him  : )
