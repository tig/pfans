Naweed - I suppose it depends on just how high you want to jack it up.  You
can always do it in stages - jack up one side a little, put the stands
underneath, then move to the other side and jack it up a little more than
the first side, put the stands underneath, then move back to the first side
- repeat until it is at the height you want.  Remember, not everyone has a
floor jack or workshop hoist/lift.  Also, the factory scissors jack is
designed for use in the center jackport to lift one side at a time.  I've
never had any problems in the last 14 years with either of my 944's, and I
use the factory unit 90% of the time.
As far as the proper frame parts to use, according to the owner's manual,
the front lift points are located on the inboard side members of the
underbody, and the rears are located on the side reinforcement brackets of
the underbody.  Note that there is nothing mentioned about a "central"
lift/jack point for either the front or rear.  I am always hesitant about
using the transaxle housing, although I know that on 914's this is THE
place.
