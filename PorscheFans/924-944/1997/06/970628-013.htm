Victoria,

If the whining goes away when you depress the clutch pedal, it is 
normal transmission noise.  It can sound like chains being dragged 
across a grating, esp. when the car and transmission are nice and warm.

If not, it may be one of two other things.  The first is normal tire 
noise.  Performance tires are pretty bad in this respect, while regular 
street tires receive a fair amount of attention to reducing noise in 
their design.  The second possibility is a wheel bearing.  Try to 
determine whether the noise comes from one side or the other, either by 
listening for it coming/going as your turn corners, or by rocking the 
car as your drive at speed.

Two things to get looked at if you purchase a 944S.  The first is the 
cam chain tensioner, which if not ever replaced is long overdue at 
140K.  Not cheap, probably around $300 for the parts and an hour of 
labor.  The second thing to have checked is the cam timing belt and 
possibly its rollers.  Make sure you have the latest design belt in the 
car, that with the .02 version code.

Enjoy your car,

Kevin

Hi,
I figure I've been a good person for 34 years and I'm about to finally
buy myself an '88 Porsche 944S. FWIW, it has 140K miles on it, but is
absolutely immaculate and has all the service records.

I'm in love with it in the worst way, so I need some good advice.

I'm hearing some whining from the rear end, whether the car is in gear 
or
out of gear and coasting. Nothing bad, and there's no other odd noises 
or
slack anywhere. Am I just sensitive to hearing rear end noises after 10 
years of FWD cars? I've read the FAQ, so I believe I'm not hearing
anything potentially catastrophic...but I'd like to hear from others.

Any anecdotal evidence available pertaining to durability of these 
cars?
The maintenance done on this one appears to be just shy of fanatical.
It appears to have been spoon-fed and babied all its life.

Thanks,
Victoria
