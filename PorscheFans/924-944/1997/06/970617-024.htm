Well, of the problems I was having yesterday, one is fixed (?).  I had my
mechanic recharge the A/C with 1.5 lbs. of freon, maybe I have a slow leak
and maybe it hasn't been charged for a while.  

Hesitation is still with me when the accelerator is almost to the floor.  I
am not seeing any indication of overboost, detonation, smoke, and up to a
certain point in throttle travel all is well, acceleration is smooth.  Past
that point, however, with the accelerator at 97% of travel or so, there is
engine miss and hesitation, the engine seems to strain a bit.  Opinions?  I
am going to put some Techron in the tank tonight, see if that helps.  Oh,
the rpm can sit at 3k-6.5k smoothly, typical cruise load, as long as the
accelerator is not completely depressed.  

I now have the money if someone has a good set of used tires to fit an '86
951, and I'm looking for that LF track control arm to fit this car (sport
suspension).
