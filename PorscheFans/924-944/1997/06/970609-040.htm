I had an opportunity to drive a Boxster at Sebring over the Memorial Day
weekend. We had an autocross on part of the course which was about 1.6
miles long. I ran my 951 on R-1's hard and had a time of 1:35. The Boxster
was a borrowed car with *very* few miles on it, stock suspension, 17 in.
wheels and stock rubber, so I ran the course deliberately taking it easy. I
ran a 1:40. I have driven Boxsters on the street a couple of times and was
favorably impressed. But, I can honestly say I have never driven a car that
is that well balanced on the track. It doesn't have the grunt of my 951,
but in every other way it is an extremely impressive package. If any of you
on the list get the opportunity to drive one on the track, I believe you
will agree with my opinion.

Mike
