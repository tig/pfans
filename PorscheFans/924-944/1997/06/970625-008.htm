Hi everybody! I know how much everybody likes to get an incredible deal
so I have to pass along the deal I just got. In the Saturday paper here
in Rochester,NY we have a special want ad section in the paper for items
under a hundred dollars. This week there was an ad for Porsche factory
manuals for $18.00!!! I called the guy at 7:00am and apologized, he told
me that I was the first person to call and he really didn't expect to
get any calls at all. I drive over in my Porsche of course to check them
out. To my surprise they were all there including the "Turbo" book. They
looked brand new, no greasy finger prints either! The guy told me that
he had moved in to the house recently and he found some boxes in the
basement. He thought that he might be able to get something for them if
anything at all. I didn't have the heart to tell him the going rate[The
price probably would have gone up quick!] Well now I have a few hundred
bucks to spend on my car! Next, the infamous tensioning
tool............We'll be watching!!!!   Jeff
