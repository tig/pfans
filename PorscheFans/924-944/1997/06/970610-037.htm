Doug, and all:

As always honoring the right to speech freely, I still want to elaborate
a little on these matters.

It has been brought to my attention that Ron (who most probably will be
able to speak for himself) is a member of this list. 

This was mainly the thing that bothered me - as there will be almost no
way for a non list member to ever see such a post.
                                             
Regards to all!
