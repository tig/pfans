After reading the tale of woe concerning Nology plug wires, I thought I
would add my $0.02.

The idea behind Nology wires, as I understand it, is the use of a
capacitor to concentrate the spark. Even if this worked, which I doubt, I
question the approach. 

Inside the combustion chamber, there is none of this textbook
spark-burn-next cycle. As MSD (Multiple Spark Discharge) pointed out years
ago, the process of lighting off the fuel-air mixture and maintaining a
continuous burn is much more of a hit and miss proposition. Using multiple
sparks, MSD claimed to be able to continue igniting the mixture,
guaranteeing fewer misfires and more complete combustion. Above about 3000
rpm they go back to a single spark, however.

The Electromotive Direct Ignition takes a somewhat different approach. 
>Disclaimer: I worked for Electromotive for almost 2 years and still do
freelance work for them.<
Through digital control of the coils, the Electromotive ignition offers a
higher current and much longer duration spark. As opposed to Nology, which
talks of a super-short duration spark, the Electromotive ignition
continues the spark over several milli-seconds covering over 60 degrees
crankshaft rotation. The long-duration spark ignites and re-ignites the
air-fuel mixture, leading to more complete combustion. 

To further back up this approach, conversations with engineers working on
mis-fire detection for the Big 3 indicate they talk in terms of frequency
of mis-fires. They are looking for threshold levels, not simply is there a
mis-fire or isn't there.

So, given I am no engineer, the long duration approach makes more sense to
me. On a commercial note, we are an Electromotive dealer and I am
available to help (on a limited basis) with any technical questions
concerning their ignitions or engine management products.
