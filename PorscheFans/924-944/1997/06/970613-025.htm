Perhaps if you join a 300ZX mailing list you will get to hear
about the many problems that develop with that car.  A friend
of mine works at a shop which specializes in Nissan repairs and
they see plenty of 300ZXs in there. :)  As for the Mercedes, you
are comparing a sedan to a high performance sports car.  I expect
my ~270 hp 951 to have more problems than a mildly powered sedan.
Contributing factors include machinery which is pushed closer to
the 'edge' as well as the driving style encouraged by all those
ponies under the hood.

What?  That's not so unusual.

With 132K, this is perfectly reasonable.

100K+ maintenance on many cars

Should be replaced as a maintenance item whether needed or not.

See comment on water pumps.

> >1 balance belt (at 130000/80 K)

See comment on balance cam belt.

> >1 engine mount at 170 000 km/105 K)

OK, they could have been stronger.  You could always replace
with a solid mount. :)

These shouldn't count against 'quality' in any car unless
you believe that 'no tune-up till 100K miles' bit that 
some manufacturers are starting to claim.
