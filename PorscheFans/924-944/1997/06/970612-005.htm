P-fans,

I made a fairly interesting discovery yesterday that I thought you all would
find interesting.  A friend of mine bought a Lexus ES300 a few months ago
and while riding in it yesterday I noticed that this new, $35k, Lexus lacked
the solidness of my tired, 15 year old 924.

Once I started paying attention, I noticed that the doors did not shut with
the solid authority of the Porsche (although, compared to others in it's
class, it is very good).  The car felt almost "tinny".  It's hard to put it
into words but it was like the plushness of the Lexus was all superficial,
there was no substanance underneath.

This discovery just further convinced me that the Porsche is truely a solid
work of art made to last.  While not without it's shortcommings, it is a car
to be loved.
